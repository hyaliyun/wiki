From 1949-1956, students attended school at the former Rome Rural HS. In 1956, a new building was opened adjacent to the Lawrence County Fairgrounds, hence the name \\"Fairland\\", and would remain the district's high school until 2002. In 2003, the current building opened and the 1956 building was renovated and transformed into Fairland Middle School. ==Athletics== Fairland High School is a member of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) along with Chesapeake, Coal Grove (Dawson- Bryant), Ironton, Portsmouth, Rock Hill, South Point, Gallia Academy. The Dragons and Lady Dragons compete in Baseball, Basketball (Boys and Girls), Cross Country (Boys and Girls), Football, Soccer (Boys and Girls), Softball, Indoor and Outdoor Track & Field (Boys and Girls), Tennis (Boys), Swimming (Girls) Volleyball, and Wrestling.

The effects of high altitude on humans are considerable. The oxygen saturation of hemoglobin determines the content of oxygen in blood. After the human body reaches around above sea level, the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to decrease rapidly. However, the human body has both short-term and long-term adaptations to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen. There is a limit to the level of adaptation; mountaineers refer to the altitudes above as the death zone, where it is generally believed that no human body can acclimatize. ==Effects as a function of altitude== The human body can perform best at sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is 101,325 Pa or 1013.25 millibars (or 1 atm, by definition). The concentration of oxygen (O2) in sea-level air is 20.9%, so the partial pressure of O2 (pO2) is 21.136 kPa. In healthy individuals, this saturates hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding red pigment in red blood cells. Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude while the O2 fraction remains constant to about , so pO2 decreases exponentially with altitude as well. It is about half of its sea-level value at , the altitude of the Everest Base Camp, and only a third at , the summit of Mount Everest. When pO2 drops, the body responds with altitude acclimatization. Mountain medicine recognizes three altitude regions which reflect the lowered amount of oxygen in the atmosphere: * High altitude = * Very high altitude = * Extreme altitude = above Travel to each of these altitude regions can lead to medical problems, from the mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness to the potentially fatal high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). The higher the altitude, the greater the risk. Expedition doctors commonly stock a supply of dexamethasone, to treat these conditions on site. Research also indicates elevated risk of permanent brain damage in people climbing to above . Humans have survived for two years at , 475 millibars of atmospheric pressure), which is the highest recorded permanently tolerable altitude; the highest permanent settlement known, La Rinconada, is at . At altitudes above , 383 millibars of atmospheric pressure), sleeping becomes very difficult, digesting food is near-impossible, and the risk of HAPE or HACE increases greatly. ===Death zone=== The summit of Mount Everest is in the death zone. The death zone in mountaineering, (originally the lethal zone) was first conceived in 1953 by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, a Swiss physician and alpinist. It refers to altitudes above a certain point where the amount of oxygen is insufficient to sustain human life for an extended time span. This point is generally tagged as , less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure). All 14 summits in the death zone above 8000 m, called eight-thousanders, are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges. Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly by loss of vital functions or indirectly wrong decisions made under stress, physical weakening leading to accidents. In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize. An extended stay in the death zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and, ultimately, death. ===Long-term effects=== The summit of K2 is in the death zone. As of 1998, studies have shown that the about 140 million people who live at elevations above have adapted to the lower oxygen levels. These adaptations are especially pronounced in people living in the Andes and the Himalayas. Compared with acclimatized newcomers, native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower hemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness (CMS). These adaptations may reflect the longer history of high altitude habitation in these regions. A lower mortality rate from cardiovascular disease is observed for residents at higher altitudes. Similarly, a dose‚Äìresponse relationship exists between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. This is not explained by migration alone. On the other hand, people living at higher elevations also have a higher rate of suicide in the United States. The correlation between elevation and suicide risk was present even when the researchers control for known suicide risk factors, including age, gender, race, and income. Research has also indicated that oxygen levels are unlikely to be a factor, considering that there is no indication of increased mood disturbances at high altitude in those with sleep apnea or in heavy smokers at high altitude. The cause for the increased suicide risk is as yet unknown. ==Acclimatization== The human body can adapt to high altitude through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, in the short term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies, which causes an increase in the breathing depth and rate (hyperpnea). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of respiratory alkalosis, inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease. In addition, at high altitude, the heart beats faster; the stroke volume is slightly decreased; and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, resulting in a decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the digestive system in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves). Full acclimatization requires days or even weeks. Gradually, the body compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days at any given altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide. Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased plasma volume, increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood. Full hematological adaptation to high altitude is achieved when the increase of red blood cells reaches a plateau and stops. The length of full hematological adaptation can be approximated by multiplying the altitude in kilometres by 11.4 days. For example, to adapt to of altitude would require 45.6 days. The upper altitude limit of this linear relationship has not been fully established. Even when acclimatized, prolonged exposure to high altitude can interfere with pregnancy and cause intrauterine growth restriction or pre-eclampsia. High altitude causes decreased blood flow to the placenta, even in acclimatized women, which interferes with fetal growth. Consequently, children born at high-altitudes are found to born shorter on average than children born at the sea level ==Athletic performance== Athletes training at high altitude in St. Moritz, Switzerland (elevation 1,856 m or 6,089 ft). For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete's performance will generally be better at high altitude. For endurance events (races of 800 metres or more), the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen, which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: for example, the governing body for the sport of athletics, World Athletics, has ruled that performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres will be approved for record purposes, but carry the notation of \\"A\\" to denote they were set at altitude. The 1968 Summer Olympics were held at altitude in Mexico City. Most short sprint and jump records were set there at altitude. Other records were also set at altitude in anticipation of those Olympics. Bob Beamon's record in the long jump held for almost 23 years and has only been beaten once without altitude or wind assistance. Many of the other records set at Mexico City were later surpassed by marks set at altitude. Athletes can also take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. However, this may not always be the case. Any positive acclimatization effects may be negated by a de- training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level. This conundrum led to the development of the altitude training modality known as \\"Live-High, Train-Low\\", whereby the athlete spends many hours a day resting and sleeping at one (high) altitude, but performs a significant portion of their training, possibly all of it, at another (lower) altitude. A series of studies conducted in Utah in the late 1990s showed significant performance gains in athletes who followed such a protocol for several weeks. Another study from 2006 has shown performance gains from merely performing some exercising sessions at high altitude, yet living at sea level. The performance-enhancing effect of altitude training could be due to increased red blood cell count, more efficient training, or changes in muscle physiology. ==See also== * 1996 Mount Everest disaster * 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash * 2008 K2 disaster * 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid, adaptation to chronic hypoxia * Altitude sickness * Altitude tent * Armstrong's limit, the altitude/pressure at which water boils in the lungs at body temperature * Aviation medicine * Gamow bag * Helios Airways Flight 522 * High-altitude adaptation * High-altitude football controversy * Hypoxemia * Hypoxia (medical) * Mars habitat * Organisms at high altitude * Oxygen‚Äìhemoglobin dissociation curve ==ReferencesIPPA, High Altitude Pathology Institute.

The club existed for over 60 years until the loss of their ground in 1988. ==History== Wellworthy Athletic FC were founded in 1927 as the works side of Wellworthy Engineering (manufacturers of automotive and aerospace components). They initially played in the Bournemouth League where they climbed up through the ranks to win promotion to the Hampshire League Division 2 in 1932. Initially, they did well, finishing runners-up in 1932‚Äì33 but were relegated after finishing bottom in 1934‚Äì35. After a spell playing in the New Forest League, Wellworthy returned to the Hampshire League in 1949 when they were placed in Division 3 West. Initially, the club again did well as they challenged for promotion twice finishing third and as runners-up in 1950‚Äì51. Throughout the decade Wellworthy remained a consistent mid-table side, with the main highlight coming when the side reached the Hampshire Intermediate Cup final in 1956‚Äì57. However, the early sixties saw a decline in fortunes and after two seasons of struggle, they were relegated in 1960‚Äì61 and returned to the Bournemouth League. During 1971 Wellworthy welcomed an Ex-Pompey XI to christen their newly installed floodlights in a game that drew 600 spectators to watch the sharing of eight goals. After many years of re-building, the eighties saw Wellworthy Athletic once again emerge as a strong force. The 1984‚Äì85 season was a memorable one as they completed a fantastic double by winning the Bournemouth League and the Pickford Cup, as well as being finalists in the Hampshire Intermediate Cup. These successes were enough for Wellworthy to deservedly return to the Hampshire League Division 3 for the 1985‚Äì86 season where they promptly won promotion as runners- up.http://www.fchd.info/WELLWORA.HTM For the 1986‚Äì87 season, the Wessex League was formed (mainly by the top and most ambitious Hampshire League clubs with the best facilities) and Wellworthy were surprisingly elected despite their Ampress Works Ground only meeting the basic requirements. Despite the big step up, they held their own and they did extremely well to finish in a very creditable 7th place. In 1987‚Äì88 Wellworthy finished in 15th place, but enjoyed a fine run in the Hampshire Senior Cup when they reached the semi- finals. En route, they surprisingly defeated Waterlooville and Portsmouth Reserves both 2‚Äì0, before losing by the same score against eventual winners Gosport Borough. Sadly this was to be their last season. The club suffered a major setback in 1988 when they lost their ground, at same the time league rivals and neighbours Lymington Town were struggling badly so the two clubs decided to join forces, becoming known as AFC Lymingtonhttp://www.fchd.info/AFC-LYMI.HTM playing at Lymington's Southampton Road home. The move proved to be an instant success as the new club soon proceeded to become a strong force in the Wessex League, winning several league titles and cups. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Division 2 **Runners-up 1932/33 *Hampshire League Division 3 **Runners-up 1985/86 *Hampshire League Division 3 West **Runners-up 1950/51 *Bournemouth League Division 1 **Champions 1984/85 *Hampshire FA Intermediate Cup **Finalists 1956/57 and 1984/85 *Bournemouth Senior Cup **Finalists 1953/54 *Bournemouth Pickford Cup **Winners 1984/85 *New Forest League **Champions 1948/49 *New Forest League Perkins Charity Cup **Winners 1948/49 and 1949/50 **Runners-up 1968/69 ==Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events - 1932/33Hampshire League Division 22/13Runners-up, but not promoted - 1933/34Hampshire League Division 26/12 - 1934/35Hampshire League Division 216/16Relegated - 1935-48  - 1949/50Hampshire League Division 3 West3/14 - 1950/51Hampshire League Division 3 West2/14Runners-up, but not promoted - 1951/52Hampshire League Division 3 West3/14 - 1952/53Hampshire League Division 3 West7/14 - 1953/54Hampshire League Division 3 West9/14 - 1954/55Hampshire League Division 3 West8/11 - 1955/56Hampshire League Division 311/16 - 1956/57Hampshire League Division 310/16 - 1957/58Hampshire League Division 39/16 - 1958/59Hampshire League Division 38/16 - 1959/60Hampshire League Division 314/16 - 1960/61Hampshire League Division 315/16Relegated - 1961-85  - 1985/86Hampshire League Division 32/18Runners-up, Joined Wessex League - 1986/87Wessex League 7/17 - 1987/88Wessex League 15/19Merged with Lymington Town } ==Famous Players== The former Southampton 1976 FA Cup winner David Peach as player-manager and the Hampshire cricket wicket keeper Adrian Aymes both turned out for the club during their Wessex League days. ==References== ==External links== *Football Club History Database Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1927 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1988 Category:1927 establishments in England Category:1988 disestablishments in England Category:Bournemouth Saturday League Category:Hampshire League Category:Wessex Football League ","title":"Wellworthy Athletic F.C."},{"id":"9091137","text":"Ironton High School (IHS) is a public high school in Ironton, Ohio, United States.

It is officially called Rock Hill Senior High School. It is the only high school in the Rock Hill Local School District. The high school is a four- year school, offering grades 9-12. Their nickname is the Redmen, and their mascot is an Indian Chieftain. Its official colors are red and white. ==Brief history== The Rock Hill Local School District formerly consisted of four separate school districts, which were located in the towns of Decatur, Hanging Rock, Kitts Hill, and Pedro. Hanging Rock, Kitts Hill, and Pedro consolidated in 1949. Consolidation went somewhat smoothly, with the new school taking something from each of the old. 'Rock' from Hanging Rock, 'Hill' from Kitt's Hill, the 'Redmen' from Pedro, as well as the location in Pedro. Decatur Township schools joined in 1965. New schools were recently built and opened in 2002. The official name of the school is Rock Hill Senior High School, however, in many instances it drops the 'Senior'; and it is mostly used ceremonially, for graduations and business. The reasoning for this is that the school used to feature 10-12 grades, and the junior high school featured 7-9. After the changes made by the Board of Education, the high school added ninth grade and the junior high added the sixth grade. The junior high school changed its name officially to \\"Rock Hill Middle School,\\" but the high school never followed suit. There are several reasons behind this, being that it is the only high school in the country to have the name, (there are other Rock Hill High Schools, but there are no other Rock Hill Senior High Schools), as well as tradition. The high school has been selected a \\"School of Promise\\" by the Ohio State Superintendent for four straight years (2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05, 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07). It was the only high school in Lawrence County, Ohio, to receive the award in 2005-06. The award was created, according to the Ohio Department of Education website, \\"To help close achievement gaps in Ohio, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) developed the Schools of Promise program to identify, recognize, and highlight schools that are making substantial progress in ensuring high achievement for all students.\\" == Athletics == Rock Hill High School is a founding member of the Ohio Valley Conference. Currently, the other members of the conference include Chesapeake High School (Panthers), Coal Grove Dawson-Bryant High School (Hornets), Proctorville Fairland High School (Dragons), South Point High School (Pointers), Ironton High School (Fighting Tigers), Portsmouth High School (Trojans) Gallia Academy High School (Blue Devils). The traditional rivals have been Coal Grove High School (Hornets), neighboring Oak Hill High School (Oaks) and Ironton High School (Fighting Tigers) . Rock Hill High School, according to the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), presently participates in the following athletics: boys' baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' cross country, cheerleading, football, boys' golf, fast-pitch softball, boys' and girls' track and field, and girls' volleyball. Recently, in 2007, the softball team won the OVC title and sectional championship. The softball team also won the sectional title in 2005, and 2009. The girls track team won an OVC title in 2006. Baseball In 2011, the boys baseball team won the OVC Championship. They continued their success by winning the OVC in 2012 and 2013 also. In 2013, the Redmen was led to a 17-6 record and to the District Championship game at Paints Stadium in Chillicothe, Ohio. Basketball In 1999 the Runnin Redmen was led to a 19-4 season and to the District Championship Game at the Convo at Ohio University in Athens Ohio, against the Portsmouth Trojans, by coach Rick Scarberry. Making this only the second Redmen team to make it to this point in the playoffs, the other also led by Scarberry Football In 2005, the football team won the OVC Championship and qualified to play in the OHSAA playoffs. The 1995 football team recorded the most wins in school history with a 10-2 record and also qualified for the school's first OHSAA Playoff appearance. The 1995 team also recorded the schools only OHSAA playoff victory with a 26-0 win over Fairfield Union High School. The 1953 football squad is the only undefeated football team in school history, with a record of 9-0. The 1953 team were crowned champions of the Lawrence County League (predating the OVC). The football team has qualified for the OHSAA state playoffs in 1995, 2003, 2005, and 2007. . ==Band Program== Dubbed locally as \\"The Pride of Lawrence County\\", currently under the direction of Nicholas Basham, the Rock Hill High School Marching Band is one of the premier marching band groups in Southern Ohio. The band holds many firsts and records across Southern Ohio and in Lawrence County. The Rock Hill High School Marching has qualified for O.M.E.A State Marching Band Competitions more times than any other school in Lawrence County, qualifying a grand total of 27 years. Rock Hill's Marching Band was also the first in Lawrence County to ever qualify for state marching band finals, the first to qualify for state concert band finals, the first to receive an overall Superior rating at state marching band finals, and is one of only two schools in the county to ever receive an overall Superior rating at state concert band finals. The band performs at O.M.E.A competitions, K.M.E.A competitions, locally adjudicated competitions in West Virginia, and in the past has performed at BOA competitions. == Other activities == Students also participate in other activities not sanctioned by the OHSAA, or athletics not officially recognized by the school board and athletic boosters. The vast majority of these clubs focus on academics as well as community service. These activities or clubs include: * Band * Bowling * Chorus * Show Choir * Theater * Envirothon * FCCLA * National Honor Society * Prom Committee * Project Lead the Way * Quiz Bowl * S.C.O.R.E.S.(academic competition) * Spanish Club * Special Olympics * Science Club * Art Club ==External links== * District Website * OHSAA Membership Directory - Rock Hill ==Notes and references== * - Rock Hill Board of Education member list * - 'The Pride of Lawrence County' * - OHSAA Member Directory & List of Activities/Coaches * - School of Promise Awardees Category:High schools in Lawrence County, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio ","title":"Rock Hill High School (Ohio)"},{"id":"9091222","text":"Spellfall is a fantasy novel by English writer Katherine Roberts, published on 19 October 2000 by The Chicken House and aimed at pre-teens. == Plot introduction == The story concerns a 12-year-old girl named Natalie who is kidnapped by a wizard named Hawk who needs her to join his spellclave (group of bonded spellmages) to receive the Power of Thirteen and invade Earthaven (an enchanted realm) to get revenge on the Spell Lords that banished him for breaking a treaty. == Characters  Natalie Marlins === Natalie \\"Nat\\" Marlins is the novel's main character. She has blonde hair and green eyes, wears glasses and is said to be pretty. Her mother, the Spell Lady Atanaqui, died when she was three years old. Natalie's father, a jobless salesman, later marries Natalie's stepmother Julie, who already has a son called Timothy. Natalie and her stepbrother dislike each other. Julie and Tim left London due to the marriage, so that the family live in an English small town whose name is Millennium Green. Natalie's only friend is Jo Carter, the strongest and tallest girl of their school, where Natalie is often teased due to her visual impairment and perceived as crazy because she owns a spider named Itsy. This animal is kidnapped by Hawk and his followers to receive the opportunity to get disposal of Natalie, but the plan is unsuccessful. During the adventure, Natalie makes friends with the coeval Merlin and K'tanaqui, Lady Atanaqui's hound. === Merlin === Merlin is Hawk's downtrodden son. His mother committed suicide when he still was a baby. Hawk regards Merlin as being completely incompetent as Merlin lacks many magical skills (Hawk chose the name \\"Merlin\\" to make fun of him). Merlin is linked with a mouse since he did not manage to get associated to a merlin. He loves computers, a passion his father does not approve of. At the end of the story, Merlin makes his father disappear by transporting in a very successful way. Then Merlin stays in Earthaven to acquaint the Spell Lords with the technology, since a bigger knowledge about computers would help them to understand Oq's system better. ===Hawk=== Hawk is the story's villain. The malicious would-be Spell Lord feverishly looks for a person with magical skills he could abduct and whose pet his goshawk could eat, so that the person would join his spellclave as a thirteenth member and make him become a Spell Lord. Hawk has long, black hair, yellow eyes, wears a hawk feather and always carries about with him a cane with a hawk head as its knob. Hawk caused the death of Merlin's mother by accidentally killing her pet, a sweet little canary. She then took a train to the coast and wandered on a high cliff; her dead body was discovered a few days later on the rocks. Afterwards, Merlin was put by his father into the cellar so that Merlin could not elope. Hawk eventually gets imprisoned between the worlds by his own son. === Jo Carter === Joanne \\"Jo\\" Carter is Natalie's best and only friend and a member of the school's netball team. They became friends after somebody had stolen Natalie's glasses and been struck down by Jo a few moments later. Jo, the most athletic girl in the school, is extremely big, has brown hair dressed like a fringe and possesses, unlike Natalie, very good eyes. She has a little sister named Sarah, a freckled girl who loves to jabber and annoy Tim. Jo convinces Natalie to learn inline skating and along with Jo's very fat and drooling dog Bilbo she goes out very early in the morning. During the lesson Natalie loses track of Jo and Bilbo as they disappear inside the fog. A little time later, Natalie is ambushed by Hawk and his followers, who inject Natalie with a tranquiliser to make her fall asleep. Hawk drowns Bilbo in a nearby river. Jo, who cannot free her friend, alerts Natalie's and her own family. During the residual course of the story, Jo and Tim become friends, too. In the end, Jo and her sister are offered a new dog. === Mr Marlins === Mr Marlins ‚Äì first name unrevealed ‚Äì is Natalie's father. He drinks much beer and is constantly intoxicated. He used to work as a salesman until he lost his job, so that he always stays at home and mainly spends his time cleaning his prestigious car, which he had not been driving any more since the death of Natalie's mother. There are quite few people whom Mr Marlins has a good relationship to, a fact which will have changed by the end of the tale. === Julie Marlins === Julie Marlins is Natalie's stepmother, Mr Marlin's wife and Tim's mother. As she told her son before marrying Mr Marlins, she regards Natalie as a confused little girl and her father as being an unhappy man. Because of this attitude, she mothers Natalie inordinately, by which she neglects her son. The latter fact led to the hostility that rose between Natalie and Tim, whereby Tim behaves more aggressively and teasingly. === Tim === Timothy Lockley, \\"Tim\\" for short, is the stepbrother of Natalie and the son of Julie. He is angry with his mother's second marriage, which forced them to leave London and move to Millennium Green. Tim also detests Natalie and her father, making them responsible for his anger and terrorising his stepsister to get rid of his aggressiveness. He has made friends with a gang composed of some of his classmates; to enter that group he had to pierce his ear with an earring that looks like a skull. Tim is described to have blonde curls. == Reception== The majority of reviews were positive, for example the Sunday Times said the novel was \\"Involving and suspenseful,\\" and the Voice of Young Advocates \\"highly recommended\\" it. Other positive comments came from Jean Ure who said Spellfall was, \\"A spellbinder! I raced enchanted through every twist and turn.\\", The Observer who said \\"A welcome and well-written addition to the sorcery genre,\\" and the Gary Dalkin, British Science Fiction Association, who said, \\"...keeps the adventure, twists, turns and thrills coming at a breathless pace.\\"Katherine Roberts' homepage ‚Äì Spellfall section Negative points were brought up by Goodtoread.org who commented that, \\"You're never sure just how incompetent any of the magical characters really are, and you never really feel for any of them except Merlin. You're not sure just how seriously you're supposed to take the magical aspects of the story.\\" Goodtoread.org review == References == == External links == * Katherine Roberts' homepage ‚Äì Spellfall page * Fantasticfiction entry for Spellfall Category:2000 British novels Category:2000 children's books Category:British fantasy novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:British children's novels Category:Novels by Katherine Roberts ","title":"Spellfall"},{"id":"9091223","text":"India participated in the 2007 Asian Winter Games held in Changchun, China from January 28, 2007 to February 4, 2007. ==References== Category:Nations at the 2007 Asian Winter Games Asian Winter Games 2007 ","title":"India at the 2007 Asian Winter Games"},{"id":"9091251","text":"Sylvia Pressler (April 10, 1934 - February 15, 2010) was an American judge who served in a number of positions within the New Jersey judicial system. She is best known for deciding a landmark 1973 case which allowed girls to compete in Little League baseball in New Jersey, and which resulted in the organization changing its charter to allow girls to play in its league nationally. Pressler served as the Chief Judge of the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court for five years. Prior to this she was the Presiding Judge for 15 years. She officially retired from the bench in 2004. A graduate of Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark at a time when the legal profession was still dominated by men, Judge Pressler was the second woman to sit on the appellate division in New Jersey, and was one of the first women to clerk for an appellate division judge. ==Biography== Pressler was born as Sylvia Diane Brodsky in New York City, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Belarus and Poland. Her father died when she was a young girl. Growing up in the Bronx, she attended Hunter College High School. She attended Queens College and later Boston University for her undergraduate studies, earning her degree in 1955, and earned her law degree from Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark. She met her husband, with whom she would later have two children, when they were both working in a restaurant in 1953. At the time that she earned her degree, the law profession in the United States was male-dominated. Pressler became one of the first women in the state to clerk for an appellate judge. For a time, she worked in private practice and as city attorney for Englewood, New Jersey. In 1973, she was appointed to the bench in Bergen County and four years later, in 1976 to the Superior Court. The following year, she was appointed to the appellate division of the Superior Court, one of the first women to serve in that role. In 1973, when serving as a Hearing Examiner for the New Jersey Department of Civil Rights, Pressler ruled on the landmark case that opened Little League baseball to girls. The case had its origins in the previous year, when a twelve-year-old girl in Hoboken, New Jersey was forced to quit a Little League baseball after only three games when national Little League authorities threatened to revoke the charter of the local league. A case was filed on behalf of the girl by the National Organization for Women. Pressler was assigned the case. She ruled in a strongly worded decision that the girl should have been allowed to play, writing: > The institution of Little League is as American as the hot dog and apple > pie. There is no reason why that part of Americana should be withheld from > girls.National Organization for Women, Essex County Chapter v. Little League > Baseball, Inc. 127 N.J.Super. 522, 318 A.2d 33 Her decision forced Little League to allow girls to play everywhere in New Jersey, and was met with protests from the national Little League organization, which called the ruling vindictive and prejudicial. The following year, the organization changed its charter nationally to allow girls to play on its teams anywhere in the United States, and created a softball division as well. According to her husband, David Pressler, she did not think that the Little League case was a difficult one to decide. In 1997, Pressler became the first woman to be appointed as Presiding Judge of the state's appellate division, and took on additional administrative responsibilities. Over the course of her career, she issued hundreds of decisions, though few as widely covered in the media as the Little League case. In 1993, she decided a second prominent case, In re. Adoption of Two Children by H.N.R. (666 A.2d 535, N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1995), giving gay couples the right to adopt the children of their partners, writing that, \\"They function together as a family.\\" In 2004, her decisionNew Jerseyans for a Death Penalty Moratorium v. New Jersey Department Of Corrections, 370 N.J. Super. 11, 850 A.2d 530. imposing a moratorium on the death penalty in New Jersey until the state's procedures could guarantee the rights of the defendant was followed three years later by legislative action banning the death penalty entirely. Her decisions were not without critics. In 1983, State Senator Gerald Cardinale attempted to block her reappointment to the Superior Court by invoking senatorial courtesy. Senate President Carmen A. Orechio removed Cardinale's ability to block her nomination, citing the fact that he had previously appeared before Judge Pressler in a legal matter, and her nomination was approved.Romano, Jay. \\"A Senate Tradition Faces Wide Attack\\", The New York Times, July 18, 1993. Accessed August 16, 2010. She retired from the bench in 2004. Pressler was awarded the medal of honor of the New Jersey State Bar Foundation in recognition of her service to that state's justice system. Judge Pressler died on February 15, 2010, following a battle with lymphoma at her home in Sparta Township, New Jersey, at the age of 75. She was survived by her husband, David Pressler and their two children and three grandchildren.N.J. judge, whose ruling banned sex discrimination in Little League, dies at 75 Until her death, Pressler was the commentator and annotator of the Gann Law Books edition of the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, which are the most commonly used edition of the Court Rules in New Jersey; the duties have since been taken over by former Attorney General and Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero, but Pressler is still credited on new editions. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Boston University alumni Category:Deaths from cancer in New Jersey Category:Deaths from lymphoma Category:New Jersey state court judges Category:People from the Bronx Category:People from Englewood, New Jersey Category:People from Sparta Township, New Jersey Category:Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark alumni Category:Rutgers University alumni Category:American people of Belarusian- Jewish descent Category:American women judges ","title":"Sylvia Pressler"},{"id":"9091256","text":"Claudia Andreatti (born 1987) was Miss Italia 2006.

It is the only high school in the Symmes Valley Local School District. Their nickname is the Vikings and the official school colors are Scarlet and Grey. There are currently approximately 300 students in grades 9-12 at the school. ==Brief history== Symmes Valley High School was created with the consolidation of Waterloo High School (Waterloo Wonders), Windsor High School, and Mason-Aid High School. The first year of classes at the school began in 1961. Although the main portion of the building was constructed in 1961, there have been several building modernization projects and additions. Six additional classrooms were added to the school in 1975. Then in 1994, a major renovation occurred during the construction of a new elementary building on the same campus. During this renovation, all asbestos was removed from the building, a new heating and air conditioning system, new lights, new ceilings, and new windows were installed. At this time, a brand new band room was constructed at the rear of the building and the gym received new seating, a refurbishment of the floor, and new paint. In 2003, another multimillion-dollar project was completed. A new, state-of-the- art library and media center was constructed along with new offices, a new kitchen and cafeteria, and several new classrooms. Also during this time, the hallways received new flooring, new lighting and ceilings again, all new interior doors, and painting. The home economics classroom was also completely remodeled. The gymnasium once again received new seating in the summer of 2007 along with a sanding and repainting of the gymnasium floor. ==Athletics== The Vikings are members of the Southern Ohio Conference (SOC) and compete in baseball (boys), basketball (girls and boys), football (boys), softball (girls), and volleyball (girls). According to the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), the school is in Division VII for football and Division IV for baseball, basketball, softball, and volleyball.

Rossport is a designated place served by a local services board, and has a population of 65. ==History== Rossport is named after John Ross (c1820-1898), construction manager for the north shore of Lake Superior route of the Canadian Pacific Railway from August 1882 to June 1885. His construction headquarters during that time period were in Port Arthur, Ontario and at Rossport, then known as McKay's Harbour.The Canadian Guide-Book Part 2, Ernest Ingersoll, published by D.Appleton, 1892 McKay's Harbour was named after Alexander McKay who operated a small fur trading post at Pays Plat and his son, Charles McKay, who was a lighthouse keeper at nearby Battle Island from 1878-1913.

In 1911 the luxury steam yacht Gunilda, owned by William_L._Harkness, foundered on the McGarvey Shoal and sank 8 kilometres from Rossport. The actual date of the sinking varies from August 11 to August 29 to August 31st depending upon the article. A Toronto Daily Star news item contained in the Friday, September 1, 1911 edition states that the vessel ran aground on Wednesday, which would be August 30, and then refers to the sinking as occurring \\"yesterday\\" or August 31, 1911. This timeframe could reflect accuracy as after the vessel ran aground on the shoal and stabilized, a small boat was sent to Rossport where arrangements were made for the dispatch of a rescue tug from Port Arthur. It would take time for that tug to travel to Rossport. Therefore there would be a difference in the time between when the Gunilda ran aground and when it was actually pulled off the shoal only to sink.YACHT GUNILDA SUNK IN LAKE SUPERIOR. (1911, Sep 02).

The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia has a major travelling retrospective of Greer's work, retroActive, which opened in 2015. A reviewer wrote that the real story of this exhibition was that Greer changed from being a sculptor whose work was based on theory to being one who was object-based. Greer is the recipient of numerous awards and grants; in 2009 he received the prestigious Governor General's Award in Visual Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and significant contribution to contemporary Canadian visual art. He prefers sculpture as his language and tries to engage the viewer in being a human, thinking object among objects, a being \\"of\\" the world, a cultural object. == Honours == *Royal Canadian Academy of Arts *Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts ==References Bibliography === * ==External links== *John Greer *Gallery 1.1.1 Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:Canadian male sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:21st-century Canadian sculptors Category:21st-century male artists Category:Living people Category:NSCAD University faculty Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts winners Category:1944 births Category:People from Amherst, Nova Scotia Category:Artists from Nova Scotia ","title":"John Greer (sculptor)"},{"id":"9091341","text":"Pauline Turner Strong is an American anthropologist specializing in literary, historical, ethnographic, media, and popular representations of Native Americans.

It connects Cave del Predil, part of the Italian municipality of Tarvisio in the northwest, with the Municipality of Bovec in the Upper Soƒça (Isonzo) Valley in Slovenia. On the Italian side, state highway no. 54 (del Friuli) leads from Tarvisio and the Canal Valley along Slizza Creek to Lake Predil, where the route to the Sella Nevea Pass in the south branches off, and uphill to the Predil crest. On the Slovenian side, road no. 203 runs downhill to Log pod Mangartom and continues to Bovec. The village of Strmec na Predelu lies just below the border crossing. ==History== The road was built from 1319 onwards by the citizens of Cividale in the Patriarchate of Aquileia with the consent of the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg, then the possessors of the Carinthian lands in the north. However, the importance of the trade route diminished after the Aquileia territory in the south was incorporated into the Domini di Terraferma by the Republic of Venice in 1420. Since 1754 the Predil Pass marked the border between the Duchy of Carinthia with the lands of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca (part of the Austrian Littoral from 1849) in the southeast, both part of the Habsburg Monarchy. During the War of the Fifth Coalition, an Austrian contingent under Captain Johann Hermann von Hermannsdorf on 18 May 1809 fought against the French forces moving from the Kingdom of Italy upon the Battle of Tarvis. Hermannsdorf was killed in battle, in 1851 a memorial was erected in his honour. In 1903 a long tunnel (≈†toln) was built beneath the pass, serving miners from Log pod Mangartom on their way to the lead mines in Cave del Predil. In World War I the mine railway was used to supply the Austro-Hungarian Army in the Battles of the Isonzo against the Kingdom of Italy. ==Gallery== File:Predil Pass - view west.JPGWest view from the pass, showing Lake Predil File:Predil Pass - Italian fort.JPGFortification on the Italian side of the pass File:Predil Pass - Austrian fort.JPGAustrian fort on the Slovenian side of the pass File:Predil Pass - Austrian monument.JPGMonument to troops killed at the pass in 1809 File:Predil Pass - Austrian grave.JPGGrave of Austrian troops killed at the pass in 1809 File:Log pod Magartom-Stoln.jpgTunnel entrance in Log pod Mangartom ==See also== * List of highest paved roads in Europe * List of mountain passes ==External links== * Predil Predil Category:Italy‚ÄìSlovenia border crossings Category:Mountain passes of the Julian Alps ","title":"Predil Pass"},{"id":"9091519","text":"Jordan participated in the 2007 Asian Winter Games held in Changchun, China from January 28, 2007 to February 4, 2007. ==References== Category:Nations at the 2007 Asian Winter Games Asian Winter Games Category:Jordan at the Asian Winter Games ","title":"Jordan at the 2007 Asian Winter Games"},{"id":"9091534","text":"Joe Harris is an American comic book writer and screenwriter.

With effect from April 2016, the fire services of Dorset and Wiltshire were merged into the Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service. ==History== Dorset County Fire Brigade was formed by mainly volunteer brigades, falling within the responsibility of Dorset County Council. Fire Brigades were nationalised during the Second World War and returned to the responsibility of County Councils on 1 April 1948. Between 1948 and 1974, Dorset Fire Brigade had eighteen part-time stations and three full-time stations. On 1 April 1974 the administrative area of Dorset County Council was increased to include Bournemouth and Christchurch (previously within the county of Hampshire)History of the service-changes and merges and with it the area of the County Fire Brigade. On 1 April 1997, as a result of local government reorganisation, two new Unitary Authorities were created in the county of Dorset: Bournemouth Borough and the Borough of Poole. Consequently, a new Combined Fire Authority (comprising the residual County Council, Bournemouth Council and Poole Council) became responsible for the service, which was renamed to Dorset Fire and Rescue Service. As part of the FiReControl project, Dorset Fire and Rescue's control room was planned to switch over to the regional control centre in Taunton. Originally scheduled to take place in March 2010, the cutover date was revised to July 2011, however the plan was scrapped in December 2010. == Fire Stations and appliances == { class= - valign=bottom !

This river's catchment basin is a sub- watershed of the Limpopo River. It is a significant watercourse in the Waterberg area of Limpopo Province. The river drains much of the Lapalala Wilderness area and considerable additional lands that are important habitat for native wildlife in a zone with considerable ongoing bushveld restoration. The predominantly dry deciduous forest community of the upland portion of the Palala River watershed is home to many large African mammals including Blue Wildebeest, Giraffe, White Rhino and numerous bovids. The Palala River has been shown to exhibit high water quality with very clear flowing waters, especially in the uppermost regions; correspondingly biotic health has been assessed as healthy using the North African catfish as a bio-marker. Interesting prehistoric rock paintings exist on bluffs along the river in the Lapalala Wilderness area. ==River biota== There are a variety of fauna that inhabit the Palala River including fish, Nile crocodile, African Rock Python and hippopotamus. In a 2004 study of the river's health, specimens of the North African catfish, Clarias gariepinus, were captured within reaches of the Lapalala Wilderness.Maxwell Barson, Endoparasites of the sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell), from the Rietvlei Dam, Sesmyl Spruit system, South Africa., Masters thesis, University of Johannesburg (2004) A healthy population of male and female fish was found in the river's upper reaches within the Lapalala Wilderness, manifesting normal body mass averaging approximately 1.1 kilograms; moreover, this fish population from the higher reaches of the Palala River was found to be free of parasites and also free of liver damage.University of Johannesburg Palala River analysis of C. Gariepinus The health of the upper reaches was such that the upper Lapala was used in subsequent studies as the healthy control group to compare to other South African rivers which were more polluted from discharge of untreated sewage and agricultural wastes within their watersheds. ==Geology and hydrology== The underlying rock formation of the Palala River basin derives from the Kaapvaal craton, formed as a precursor island roughly 2.7 billion years ago. This crustal formation became the base of the Waterberg, which was further transformed by upward extrusion of igneous rocks.William Taylor, Gerald Hinde and David Holt-Biddle, The Waterberg, Struik Publishers, Cape Town, South Africa (2003) These extruded rocks, containing minerals such as vanadium and platinum, are called the Bushveld igneous complex, leading to the colourful bluff faces along much of the Palala River. The original extent of this rock upthrust involved about 250,000 square kilometers, and is sometimes called the Waterberg Supergroup. Sedimentary deposition from the Palala, Mokolo River and other rivers cutting through Waterberg continued through the era of 2.5 billion to 250 million years ago. Around 250 million years ago the supercontinent Gondwana split into its modern day continents. The Palala River catchment basin today contains swamps, bushveld, mesas, and some kopje outcrops. ==Prehistoric rock paintings== Bushman Stone Age rock painting, bluffs above Palala River On vertical cliffs above the Palala River are some locations of significant prehistoric Bushman rock paintings dating to approximately 8000 BC.C.Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, The Waterberg Biosphere, Lumina Technologies, May 22, 2006. These paintings are produced on vertical rock faces, with the best specimens being protected by large rock overhangs. The works depict hunting scenes and various native game, especially antelopes. The media used are paints produced with dyes concocted from native plants and soil minerals; the paints themselves have proved to be remarkably resistant to millennia of weathering. These sites are very difficult to access, since there are no paved roads for access; in fact, even after a four-wheeled drive over deeply mudded and rutted bushveld roads, there is a considerable hike over swampy terrain. Furthermore, these sites are appropriately not well marked or defined on park maps. After reaching the general area of the paintings, one must descend approximately halfway down the vertical bluffs along the Palala; assistance with a knowledgeable native guide is essential ==Waterberg Massif== Much of the Palala River course is through the Waterberg Biosphere, a massif of approximately 15,000 square kilometers. Waterberg is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. The extensive rock formation was shaped by hundreds of millions of years of riverine erosion to yield diverse bluff and butte landform. The ecosystem can be characterised as a dry deciduous forest or Bushveld. Within the Waterberg there are archaeological finds dating to the Stone Age, and nearby are early evolutionary finds related to the origin of humans. ==See also== *Drainage basin A * List of rivers of South Africa *Bushmen *Rock painting *Nile crocodile ==References== ==External links== *Palala River water quality and biota studies: site selection Category:Rivers of South Africa Category:Rivers of Limpopo ","title":"Palala River"},{"id":"9091585","text":"Byron Kim (born in 1961 in La Jolla, California) is a contemporary artist who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. In the early 1990s he produced minimalist paintings exploring racial identity. He graduated from Yale University in 1983 where he was a member of Manuscript Society. ==Works== Kim's work in the early 1990s consisted of monochrome canvases depicting the skin tones of friends and family.Carey Lovelace, Byron Kim at Max Protetch - Brief Article, Art in America, October 2001.

Synecdoche (1991‚Äì1992) is a grid of 400 small, monochromatic paintings. Each panel recreates the skin color of an individual who sat for Kim while he painted their portrait. Although the works, at first glance, resemble minimalist paintings of the 1960s the racial and political dimensions became apparent after reading in the exhibition catalogue how the works came about.Michael Kelly in Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Politics and Aesthetics in the Arts, Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp249-250. These monochrome canvases were followed by two or three- zoned canvases that color-sampled objects, sites or people. Kim collaborated with artist Glenn Ligon on Black & White (1993), part of a series critiquing the 'prejudices' of art materials, specifically the hues of 'Flesh'-colored tubes of paint.Erika Doss, Twentieth-Century American Art, Oxford University Press, 2002, p237. 46 Halsey Drive Wallingford CT (1995) records his family members' various recollections of the color of a home Kim lived in as a child.

It is about the life of Alexander the Great, told from the point of view of his horse, Bucephalus. ==Plot summary== The pair meet in Pella, Macedonia, and Alexander manages to be the only rider on Bucephalus after a battle in which Bucephalas lost his left eye by an enemy pike. Katherine Roberts acknowledges that the characters Charmia and Tydeos, both grooms in the royal stable, are fictional, as is the evil horsemaster. The names of the other horses are also fictional, though the horses themselves were real enough. Prince Ochus, King Darius's son, was given a larger part than in most records, and the ghosts that Bucephalus often sees are also fictional. From the moment the battle- scarred horse Bucephalas allows a prince and a runaway girl to sit on his back, he is bound to them for ever. The prince is the young Alexander the Great, who he proudly carries into battle, blazing a trail to the very edge of the world in master's search for glory and adventure. The girl, Charm, is a lowly stable hand, who brushes away the ghosts Bucephalas sees and forgives his arrogant ways. But unlike Alexander, Charm has darker reasons to stay by his side.

World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia, pp. 27, 71, 135. Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. . The system stretched from the city center to Braker√∏ya, Merket and V√•rveien and was operated by the companies Drammens Elektriske Bane, A/S Trikken and Drammen Kommunale Trikk. The system was well suited for Drammen, since the city has a lot of hills and cheap electricity. ==History== When the system opened in 1909 it was the first trolleybus system in Scandinavia. The first plans for public transport in Drammen were proposed by Carl Christian Juell for a horsecar system, but instead he started developing the Gothenburg tram in Gothenburg, Sweden. In the 1890s Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim got horsecar and later tram systems, and in 1904 it was proposed that also Drammen get a similar system. But Engineer Hans Jensen had been to D√ºsseldorf and seen the trolleybus system there, and in 1909 the company Drammens Elektriske Bane got permission to build a trolleybus system. The company had an initial capital of NOK 140,000 and built the 7.7 km line Brager√∏en-Torvet-Landfall√∏en and Torvet-Tangen. Drammen trolleybuses used the Schiemann system - two wires were located 15 cm apart (voltage: 550V); the vehicles used a single trolley pole. Drammen was the last trolleybus system in the world to use this type of current collection. The first four buses and the infrastructure were delivered by Max Schiemann & Co in Germany. The initial system had a headway of 30 minutes, but this was changed to 20 minutes in 1912. Within a few years the system had reached a ridership of more than one million passenger annually. During World War I the company came into deep economic problems, and the ticket price was increased from 10 √∏re to 15 √∏re and the municipality gave the company a 25% discount on electricity. Still, in 1916 the company went bankrupt. A new company, A/S Trikken, was created to continue operations. The system had since the start had a disadvantage in that only empty buses could cross the City Bridge that connected the two lines. But in 1936 a new bridge was constructed allowing buses to drive in a continual, triangular loop. After World War II the system was again quite petty, and on 1 July 1947 the City Council created a municipal owned company, Drammen Kommunale Trikk (lit: Drammen Municipal Tram), to operate the system. The routes that in the 1930 had been reduced to 12 minutes headway were then reduced to 10 minutes and in 1951 to 9 minutes. In 1960 the company also rebuilt the buses so that they only needed a driver and not a driver and conductor and expanded the western route to V√•rveien. In 1960 the sale of cars in Norway was deregulated, resulting in an enormous fall in passenger numbers for the trolleybus system. On 7 January 1963 the route to Braker√∏ya was taken over by diesel buses. The rest of the system was closed on 10 July 1967. When the system closed, it was the second oldest operating trolleybus system in the world. The operating company was also responsible for the new diesel bus routes, and in 1981 it was merged to create Drammen og Omegn Busslinjer, now part of Nettbuss. ==References== Drammen Category:Trolleybus transport in Norway Category:Bus transport in Viken ","title":"Trolleybuses in Drammen"},{"id":"9091719","text":"Kopidlno is a town in Jiƒç√≠n District in the Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region of the Czech Republic.

His father was an eminent lawyer, and his mother Livia remarkable for gentleness and wisdom. He is venerated as a saint on Nov. 22.http://catholicsaints.mobi/calendar/22-november.htm He was probably first cousin to Gregory of Nazianzus, and was brought up in the peculiarly religious atmosphere of the Christian aristocracy of his native province. He studied law in Antioch with Libanius, practised at Constantinople, but soon retired to lead a religious life in the vicinity of his friend and relative, the \\"theologian\\" of Nazianzus. He was soon drawn within the circle of influence around Basil of Caesarea, and seems to have been for a while a member of the Christian \\"City of the Poor\\" that Basil had built at C√¶sarea. Early in 374 he was bishop of the important see of Iconium, probably placed there by Basil, whom he continued to aid in Cappadocian ecclesiastical affairs until Basil's death (379). Thenceforth he remained in close relations with Gregory of Nazianzus, and accompanied him to the Council of Constantinople (381), where Jerome met and conversed with him (De Vir. Ill., c. 133). In the history of theology he occupies a place of prominence for his defence of the divinity of the Holy Spirit against the Macedonians. It was to him that Basil dedicated his work \\"On the Holy Spirit\\". He wrote a similar work, now lost. We know, however, that he read it to Jerome on the occasion of their meeting at Constantinople. His attitude towards Arianism is illustrated by the well-known anecdote concerning his audience with Theodosius I and his son Arcadius. When the Emperor rebuked him for ignoring the presence of his son, he reminded him that the Lord of the universe abhorreth those who are ungrateful towards His Son, their Saviour and Benefactor. He was very energetic against the Messalians, and contributed to the extirpation of that group. Basil, who appointed him to his bishopric, had a high opinion of Amphilochius. In the next generation Theodoret described him in very flattering terms,Hist. Eccl., IV, x; V, xvi. and he is quoted by councils as late as 787. Jerome also includes him as one of the Cappadocians in a list of Christian exemplars of secular erudition.Jerome, Epistle LXX Because Amphilochius only started to study theology after he became a bishop, his work retains a certain simplicity. According to Georges Florovsky, it becomes evident in his theological writing that he has no philosophical background or particular interest in it. His writing was contingent upon his needs as a pastor and teacher in the struggle against heresy. That said, Florovsky also praises his writing as \\"inspired by a calm and sincere faith\\" and his homiletic use of rhetoric, describing it as \\"reminiscent of Gregory the Theologian.\\" Georges Florovsky, The Eastern Fathers of the Fourth Century, p.234. ==Works== Most of Amphilochius' work has been lost. Eight homilies have survived, including the oldest known sermon on the Feast of the Purification of the Lord (In Occursum Domini).Which is deemed spurious anyway, by M. Sachot, L'hom√©lie pseudo- chrysostomienne sur la Transfiguration CPG 4724, BHG 1975: Contextes liturgiques, restitution √† L√©once, pr√™tre de Constantinople, √©dition critique et comment√©e, traduction et √©tudes connexes (Frankfurt am Main - Bern 1981) (Publications Universitaires Europ√©ennes s. XXIII: Th√©ologie, 151). The Oration at Midpentecost (In Mesopentocostem), which refers to the feast of Mid-Pentecost is spurious.See Sachot. His style and concern for historical accuracy puts Amphilochius in the place of predecessor to John Chrysostom, who may have been influenced by him.Georges Florovsky, The Eastern Fathers of the Fourth Century, pp.233-234. In addition to his homilies, there is also an epistle to the council of Iconium of 376, and a didactic work (of questionable authenticity) Epistula Iambica ad Seleucum. The spurious \\"Iambics to Seleucus\\" offers an early and important catalogue of the canonical writings; other spurious fragments, current under his name, are taken from scriptural discourses, dogmatic letters and controversial writings.P.G., XXXIX, 13-130. The polemical treatise Against False Asceticism of Amphilochius of Iconium is expressly directed against the beliefs and practices of the ‚ÄòEncratites‚Äô and ‚ÄòApotactites‚Äô of rural Lycaonia. It seems to be written in the second half of the 370s. His only genuine extant work is, according to Bardenhewer,Patrologie, p. 249. the \\"Epistola Synodica\\", a letter against the Macedonian heresy in the name of the bishops of Lycaonia, and probably addressed to the bishops of Lycia.Goldhorn, S. Basil., Opp. Sel. Dogm., 630-635. ==Thought== Amphilochius' theology typically follows in the footsteps of his Cappadocian peers, and he defines the Trinity by the hypostatic properties of the Son as generation and the Spirit as procession. He does, however, innovate in designating the hypostases with a new phrase, \\"mode of being\\" (œÑœÅœåœÄŒøŒπ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·Ω∫œÄŒ¨œÅŒæŒµœâœÇ). This expression had not been used by the Cappadocian Fathers and was a step toward understanding the Trinity with language not aimed at essence, but relations. By the beginning of the fifth century, this phrase was generally accepted in theological uses.Georges Florovsky, The Eastern Fathers of the Fourth Century, pp.234-235. Besides his Trinitarian thought, Amphilochius also anticipated later theological usage with his Christological terminology of \\"hypostasis.\\" In his insistence on the human nature of Christ, he was led to conclude that Christ had two wills and two natures.Georges Florovsky, The Eastern Fathers of the Fourth Century, p. 235. ==See also== *Saint Amphilochius (Konya) ==References== ==Editions== * G.

She was the mother of Emperor Xuan. ==Background== Li Ezi was born in 536, around the Jiangling region, then ruled by Liang dynasty. In 554, Northern Zhou's predecessor state Western Wei's general Yu Jin () launched a major attack on Jiangling, then the capital of Liang's Emperor Yuan, capturing it and killing Emperor Yuan. While Western Wei then declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha Liang's emperor (as Emperor Xuan), to be a vassal of Western Wei, when Yu withdrew, he captured most of the population of Jiangling and the surrounding region back to the Western Wei capital Chang'an as spoils of war. Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai awarded Li Ezi to his son Yuwen Yong, then the Duke of Fucheng, to be Yuwen Yong's concubine. She was seven years older than Yuwen Yong. ==Empress Dowager== After Yuwen Tai's death in 556, his son Yuwen Jue took the throne from Emperor Gong of Western Wei in 557, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou as its Emperor Xiaomin. As the emperor's brother, Yuwen Yong continued to carry the title of duke, although he was promoted to the Duke of Lu by another brother, Emperor Ming, who succeeded Emperor Xiaomin after the powerful regent Yuwen Hu deposed and killed Emperor Xiaomin later in 557. In 559, Lady Li gave birth to Yuwen Yong's oldest son Yuwen Yun. (She would later bear him another son, his second son Yuwen Zan (), although the date of Yuwen Zan's birth is not known to history.) In 560, Emperor Ming was poisoned by Yuwen Hu, and Yuwen Yong became emperor (as Emperor Wu). He created Yuwen Yun the Duke of Lu. He did not create Consort Li empress, and immediately began overtures to pursue formal marital relations with Tujue, commencing in marrying the daughter of Tujue's Mugan Khan, Ashina Qijin in 568 as his empress. However, Empress Ashina did not bear a son, and in 572, after Emperor Wu killed Yuwen Hu and personally took power, he created Yuwen Yun crown prince. In summer 578, Emperor Wu died, and Yuwen Yun became emperor (as Emperor Xuan). He honored both Empress Ashina and Consort Li as empress dowagers (with Consort Li carrying the secondary title of Di Taihou (), to distinguish her from Empress Ashina's greater title of Huang Taihou (). ==Grand Empress Dowager== In spring 579, the erratic Emperor Xuan formally passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (as Emperor Jing), and he took an atypical title for a retired emperor ‚Äî \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂ∏ù, Tianyuan Huangdi). He thereafter changed her title several times ‚Äî to Tianyuan Di Taihou () in spring 579, then Tian Huang Taihou in summer 579, and Tianyuan Sheng Huang Taihou in spring 580. In summer 580, Emperor Xuan died, and Emperor Jing, then under the control of the regent Yang Jian, honored both Empress Dowager Ashina and her as grand empress dowagers ‚Äî but with the title Tai Di Taihou () to distinguish her from the greater title of Tai Huang Taihou () that Empress Dowager Ashina carried. In 581, Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing, ending Northern Zhou and starting Sui Dynasty (as its Emperor Wen). Emperor Jing and other members of Northern Zhou's imperial Yuwen clan were soon slaughtered. Grand Empress Dowager Li became a Buddhist nun, and changed her name to Changbei. She died in 588, and was buried only with ceremony due a Buddhist nun, south of Chang'an. == References == * Book of Zhou, vol. 9. * History of the Northern Dynasties, vol. 14. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 173, 174.

George Raft, billed sixth, was listed much lower in the cast than the size of his role indicated because he was at the dawn of his career. His part was as large as any of the other players except for Hopkins and arguably Oakie.

Gloria has a \\"past\\" with both Duke and Louie but as the film opens is falling for Floyd. Floyd is steady and true but might not be if he knew more about her romantic history. Duke thinks Gloria is not good enough for Floyd whom he treats as a brother. Louie is interested in having her back but not as much as he wants to rob premises upstairs from the dance hall. Floyd proposes to Gloria; she accepts but is worried about her past and puts him off. Duke manoeuvres him out of town for a few months and sets about luring Gloria back to him to expose her shallow nature. The ploy fails because he starts to fall in love with her as well. In the meantime the robbery takes place (off screen) and Louie kills someone but isn't caught.

She founded the Philippine Madrigal Singers in 1963. She was also an adjudicator in numerous international choral competitions and was an active force in choral music before her massive stroke in 2005. ==Early life== She was born on July 11, 1928, to Macario Ofilada and Raymunda Carriaga. She was raised in Manila, Philippines. She earned her Bachelor of Music degrees in Piano and Voice at the University of the Philippines Diliman, graduating cum laude. She was a lyric soprano soloist in various Oratorio works and in the Opera Stage. She was also a very accomplished pianist and accompanist and was the accompanist of National Artist for Music, Jovita Fuentes for a number of years. Apart from being an extraordinary musician, she was also an exceptional athlete as a competitive swimmer. She was part of the Philippine swimming team who first competed internationally in Hong Kong. ==Philippine Madrigal Singers== Later on, she continued to pursue her master's degree in Voice at Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana, as a Fulbright scholar, where she encountered the Indiana University Madrigal Singers, who rallied the music of the Renaissance period. Upon her return to the Philippines in 1963, she established a singing group with the same idea. This group was initially exclusive of U.P. faculty members and students and became officially known as the University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers. She established a tradition for which the Madz, as they are fondly called, are known for: unlike most choirs, the Madz were seated in a semicircular formation without a conductor. The Choirmaster is at the left-most end of the circle, and leads the group by giving their cues, much like how a concertmaster leads in an orchestra. Under her direction, the Philippine Madrigal Singers won major awards in international choral competitions, including those in Spittal an der Drau, Austria; Arezzo and Gorizia, Italy; Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland; Debrecen, Hungary; Varna, Bulgaria; Tolosa, Spain; and Marktoberdorf, Germany. In 1996, she led the Philippine Madrigal Singers to its victory in the 1996 International Choral Competition in Tolosa, Spain. This made them eligible to compete for the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing the following year and eventually won the title in Tours, France. Veneracion was the founding choirmaster and first conductor of the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music (AILM) Chorale.Filipinas and Dutch discuss together the role of political participation in integration ‚Äì Bayanihan March 2006 Later, some of her choristers established their own careers as well-known music performers and choral composers, conductors and arrangers in the Philippines; they include Ryan Cayabyab, Joel Navarro, Joy Nilo, Victor Asuncion, Montet Acoymo, Robert Delgado, Edgardo Nepomuceno, Jonathan Velasco, Eudenice Palaruan, Fr. Arnold Zamora, Christopher Borela, Anna Tabita Abeleda- Piquero, Fabian Obispo, Ruben Federizon, Eric Robert Santos and the present Madz Choirmaster, Mark Anthony Carpio. In 1997, she was given the TOFIL (The Outstanding Filipino) Award for Culture and the Arts For her contributions to the development of choral singing in the Philippines. In 1999, she was named National Artist for Music, the highest cultural award bestowed by the Philippine government for an individual. In 2001, she retired as the Choirmaster of the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Together with an artistic committee, she personally selected Mark Anthony Carpio, her Assistant Choirmaster at that time, to be her successor. The Madz turnover ceremonies were held in a special concert at the Cultural Center of the Philippines coinciding with the launch of her biography \\"A Life Shaped By Music\\" by Marjorie Evasco. She continued to guide the Madz under Carpio's baton by joining them in their 2002 North American Tours, 2003 Asian Tours and 2004 European Concert Tours. She was also there to witness Carpio's first international competition as Choirmaster (and the Madz's first competition after 7 years) at the 2004 International Competition of Habaneras and Polyphony in Torrevieja, Spain, where the Madz won First places for both categories and was also the last choir to do so.

After listening to punk rock for a couple of years, Peter Zirschky decided to start a punk band.

In 1983, Zirschky placed an ad in the Dutch punk magazine Koekrand, saying: \\"Need a bassplayer, don't have to be good, but has to be pretty fast\\", recruiting William Steinh√§user to play the bass and forming the core of the revived Funeral Oration.

His actual existence has been contested on the grounds that embellishing stories related to Gothic ancestry were rather popular during the Caliphate of Cordoba. The name is anachronistic, and no Banu Qasi is attested until Mutarrif ibn Musa during the 780s, but he is identified with just his father's name and not explicitly linked to Cassius or the Banu Qasi. Historians point out that the origins of the Banu Qasi, as recounted by Ibn al-Qutiyya, could be a product of the spurious antiquarianism of the later Umayyad period rather than reliable genealogy, satisfying the need for stories which bridged the conquest.Ann Christys, Christians in Al- Andalus, 711-1000, p. 176. According to the tenth century Gothic Muwallad historian Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714, shortly after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, as a client (mawali) of the Umayyads; his family came to be called the Banu Qasi (, the \\"sons of Cassius\\"). Cassius had converted at the hands of the Arab, Hassan ibn Yassar al-Hudhali, qadi in Zaragoza at the time of Abd ar-Rahman's arrival in the peninsula, as a means to preserve his lands and political power. Cassius joined forces with Musa ibn Nusayr and Tariq ibn Ziyad, and is reported to have travelled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Caliph Al-Walid I. The eleventh century Arab historian Ibn Hazm attributed five sons to Cassius: Fortun, Abu Tawr, Abu Salama, Yunus, and Yahya. The Banu Qasi dynasty descended from Fortun, the eldest son; the second son may have been the Abu Taur of Huesca who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778; and the Banu Salama, a family that ruled Huesca and Barbitanya (Barbastro) in the late tenth century, may have descended from Abu Salama.Ca√±ada Juste, Los Banu Qasi, pp. 7-9. At the time of the Muslim arrival and after, Cassius ruled an area comprising Tudela, Tarazona, Borja, and, probably, Ejea. ==References== == Bibliography == * Ca√±ada Juste, Alberto (1977). \\"El posible solar originario de los Banu Qasi\\", in Homenaje a don Jos√© M.¬™ Lacarra..., Zaragoza, I. * Ca√±ada Juste, Alberto (1977). \\"Los Banu Qasi (714-924)\\", in Principe de Viana, vol. 41, pp. 5-95 (1980). * * Collins, Roger (1994).

CGG provides geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to customers primarily from the global oil and gas industry. It has three complementary businesses: Equipment, Acquisition, and Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR). ==HistoryCGG=== In 1926, Conrad Schlumberger, and his brother Marcel Schlumberger, formed Soci√©t√© de Prospection Electrique (SPE) which specialized in oil and coal exploration as well as civil engineering. In March 1931, SPE and Soci√©t√© G√©ophysique de Recherches Mini√®res (SGRM), both specialists in seismology and magnetometry, merged into La Compagnie G√©n√©rale de G√©ophysique. SGRM provided 5,000,000 francs of capital and CGG capital of 120,000 francs. In his premises at 30 rue Fabert, in Paris, Conrad Schlumberger decided to transfer the subsurface business to CGG while SPE retained the logging. At the same time, Raymond Maillet from SGRM was appointed President of CGG. The first two years of business for CGG were shaky. Near-surface surveys (hydrology, mining and civil engineering) and oil exploration were not enough to break even in a period when oil was worth 10 cents a barrel. In 1966, CGG opened its first seismic data processing center in Massy, France. ===Veritas DGC=== Veritas Energy Services, a geophysical services company, was established in 1974 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with the purchase of Rafael B. Cruz and Associates Ltd. by David B. Robson. Meanwhile, Digital Consultants Inc. had been established in Houston, Texas in 1965 with a vision to apply digital computing to the geophysical industry. In 1969, Digital Consultants reincorporated as Digicon Inc. (DGC), becoming a public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1996, Veritas DGC was formed from the merger of Veritas and Digicon. ==OrganizationEquipment=== CGG‚Äôs Equipment business, Sercel, offers systems, sensors and sources for seismic acquisition and downhole monitoring. Oilfield service companies and geophysical contractors use the equipment for monitoring subsurface characteristics on onshore, offshore, downhole and seabed activities. ===Acquisition=== CGG has the full range of data acquisition capabilities to conduct all types of geophysical surveys, large or small, onshore, offshore and in the air. They are unique in being able to provide seamless coverage with a wide portfolio of seismic and geophysical methods in any environment. ===Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)=== The Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir Division provides seismic and geophysical services for characterizing the subsurface, and monitoring hydrocarbon reservoirs. Services include Land and Marine Seismic Acquisition, Geophysical Processing and Imaging, and Reservoir Characterization. ==Notes== Category:Engineering companies of France Category:Geophysical companies Category:Oilfield services companies Category:Oil companies of France Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1931 Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1931 Category:French companies established in 1931 Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Seismological observatories, organisations and projects Category:Companies based in Paris ","title":"CGG (company)"},{"id":"9092040","text":"Acquiescence bias, also known as agreement bias, is a category of response bias common to survey research in which respondents have a tendency to select a positive response option or indicate a positive connotation disproportionately more frequently. Respondents do so without considering the content of the question or their 'true' preference. Acquiescence is sometimes referred to as \\"yea-saying\\" and is the tendency of a respondent to agree with a statement when in doubt. Questions affected by acquiescence bias take the following format: a stimulus in the form of a statement is presented, followed by 'agree/disagree,' 'yes/no' or 'true/false' response options. For example, a respondent might be presented with the statement \\"gardening makes me feel happy,\\" and would then be expected to select either 'agree' or 'disagree.' Such question formats are favoured by both survey designers and respondents because they are straightforward to produce and respond to. The bias is particularly prevalent in the case of surveys or questionnaires that employ truisms as the stimuli, such as: \\"It is better to give than to receive\\" or \\"Never a lender nor a borrower be\\". Acquiescence bias can introduce systematic errors that affect the validity of research by confounding attitudes and behaviours with the general tendency to agree, which can result in misguided inference. Research suggests that the proportion of respondents who carry out this behaviour is between 10% and 20%. == Causes  Agreeableness === A prominent psychological explanation attributes acquiescence bias to social norms that encourage agreeable behaviour. Evidence indicates that respondents approach surveys as though they are common conversations. A consequence of this is that the conventions that govern conversations influence the interpretation of survey questions and responses to them. Accordingly, pressure to conform to such norms and conventions prompts people to agree with stimulus statements. Based on research into the \\"Big Five\\" personality traits, individuals are predisposed to agreeable behaviour to differing degrees. === Perceived authority of the interviewer === An explanation favoured by sociologists is that acquiescence bias is a product of the combination of the inclination to yield to the opinions of high authority individuals, and respondents' perception of the researcher/ interviewer as having higher authority. According to this explanation, when selecting answers, a tendency to agree with statements made by the interviewer arises from the respondent's intention of being polite or respectful. In support of this, there is evidence that indicates that respondents of lower social status acquiesce more frequently that respondents of higher social status. However, several studies have failed to replicate this finding. === Satisficing === Acquiescence bias is proposed to be a product of 'satisficing' behaviour. 'Satisficing' sees respondents select responses that are satisfactory or good enough, rather than engage in 'optimizing,' which produces best possible selection. This is done to conserve cognitive energy.  Four-stage model of the response process  Roger Tourangeau, Lance J. Rips, Kenneth Rasinski have developed a cognitive model that proposes four stages to the process of survey response selection. Each stage entails several specific cognitive processes. For example, the Comprehension stage entails paying attention to a question or instruction set. They propose that some cognitive processes are required in order to select an answer whereas others serve as optional aids. A respondent's decision of which processes to employ from the model is determined by a number of influences, notably speed and precision. The four stages: * Comprehension ‚Äì understanding the question and the information required. * Retrieval (for factual questions) ‚Äì remembering or calling to mind the appropriate information. * Judgement (for factual questions) ‚Äì the processing of recalled information to form judgements. * Selection ‚Äì choosing and communicating an answer. Two sets of processes have been proposed: translating a judgement into the scales provided, and revising the response based on factors such as 'consistency'. Survey response effects can arise at any stage of the response process.  Strong and weak satisficing  Two forms of 'satisficing' have been proposed: * Weak satisficing: Respondents still execute all four stages of the 'Four stage model of the response process.' However, the stages are carried our less rigorously, which results in the output being satisfactory rather than highly accurate. An example of weak satisficing is a respondent who doesn't search their memory as deeply as possible. This would lead to acquiescence if the respondent only scanned their memory for information supporting the positive response option. * Strong satisficing: Respondents implement a surface-level approach to answering the question by omitting the 'Retrieval' and 'Judgement' stages and only engaging in 'Comprehension' and 'Selection.' The respondent does not access any internal cognitive resources concerning the construct of interest for the question. A mechanism of selecting an appropriate answer may instead involve interpreting external cues such as question-wording. Following the social convention of agreeing is one alternative mechanism that would lead to Acquiescence bias. == Solutions  Balanced scales === This approach involves the modification of scales to include an equal ratio of positively and negatively framed items. In other words, a particular construct is assessed using conflicting stimulus statements. For example, in trying to assess depression it would be a good idea to also include items assessing happiness and contentedness, etc. (reversed-keyed items), in addition to the usual depressive content. The rationale is that such reverse-coded items force respondents to engage consciously and deliberately with survey questions, rather than automatically. While this technique has been shown to minimise a construct's relationship with acquiescence bias, it is imperfect in that respondents continue to provide responses biased by acquiescence. Douglas N. Jackson demonstrated acquiescence responding on the California F-scale (a measure of authoritarianism), which contains such truisms. He created a reverse-keyed version of the California F-scale where all the items were the opposite in meaning (see the two previous examples for a pair of such contradictory statements). He administered both the original and reverse-keyed versions of the California F-scale to the same group of respondents. One would expect that the correlation between these two scales to be negative, but there was a high, positive correlation. Jackson interpreted this as evidence of acquiescence responding. Respondents were merely being agreeable to the statements, regardless of the content. In such cases, the only effect of the technique is in moving individuals from the positive pole of the scale to the midpoint which, it is argued, achieves nothing. === Statistical correctives === The use of two techniques has been proposed to separate out acquiescence bias from constructs of interest: Factor analysis, and Ipsatization. Jackson and Messick, using factor analysis, also demonstrated that the two main factors explaining the majority of response variation on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were for social desirability and acquiescence responding (this would also hold true for the revised MMPI-2). === Question choice === Some researchers have denounced the use of 'agree/disagree' scales (including 'yes/no' and 'true/false' variations) and call for the use of question types that aren't as susceptible to acquiescence bias. One alternative is 'item-specific' (IS) questions. Instead of providing a statement and 'agree/disagree' response option, the statement is transformed into a direct question and response options present a range that captures the extremities of an attitude or behaviour. For example, the statement 'I like the colour blue,' is transformed into 'do you like the colour blue?' with response options ranging from 'not at all' to 'very much.' Proponents of this solution reason that 'agree/disagree' scales demand excess cognitive resources. In many cases, a response to the direct question is a pre-requisite to providing an 'agree/disagree' choice; a person first responds to 'how often do I feel like starting a new hobby?' when presented with the statement 'I regularly feel like starting a new hobby.' There is, therefore, an additional process of translation onto the 'agree/disagree' scale. ==See also== * Likert scale * Social desirability bias ==References== Category:Cognitive biases Category:Sampling (statistics) ","title":"Acquiescence bias"},{"id":"9092051","text":"The Arden Theatre Company is a full-service professional regional theatre located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offering theatrical and educational productions and programs to artists, audiences, and students of the greater Philadelphia region.

Stephen was the first individual to identify and sell to the young menswear mass market which emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was also the pioneer of the high turnover, disposable fashion ethos of such contemporary operators as Topman. By 1967, Stephen operated a chain of 15 shops on the thoroughfare in central London which he and boyfriend Bill Franks made the epicentre of Swinging London: Carnaby Street. \\"Carnaby is my creation,\\" Stephen said in 1967.Town, December 1967 \\"I feel about it the same way Michelangelo felt about the beautiful statues he created.\\" ==Career== Born in Glasgow, Stephen became a welder's apprentice on leaving school. He moved to London from Glasgow in 1952 at the age of 18, and worked as a waiter and also for London's first young male boutique, Vince Man Shop in Newburgh Street, central London. In 1956 Stephen opened his own retail outlet in Beak Street but a fire at the premises forced a move in 1957 to 5 Carnaby Street, then an undistinguished narrow parade behind the London Palladium. He and Franks made their mark by painting the exterior canary yellow and blaring out pop music, while selling short-runs of such designs as jeans in various colours, simple unlined three button jackets, matelot shirts, Italian knits, etc. This outlet ‚Äì called His Clothes ‚Äì was followed by others under Stephen's name or other titles including Domino Male, Mod Male and Male W1. Stephen's fast-turnover approach to design and free-and-easy retail environments with music and attractive young staff was soon emulated by others including Lord John, Take Six, Gear and Mates. Stephen expanded his retail business ‚Äì including outlets for female customers ‚Äì with shops in other London locations, including Chelsea, opened a clothing manufacturer in Glasgow and operated franchises in the US and Russia. John Stephen opened the first boutique with women's clothing on Carnaby Street called TreCamp. Stephen's clothes were worn by those at the forefront of the beat boom and Swinging London, including The Who, The Kinks, the Rolling Stones and The Small Faces. Such was the popularity of Carnaby Street that it was paved and pedestrianised in 1973. Thereafter it became home to tourist and novelty outlets, as London fashion's centre moved west to Chelsea, with such psychedelic stores as Michael Rainey's Hung On You, Granny Takes a Trip, Mr Freedom and Dandie Fashions, and Kensington, Biba and Bus Stop. Stephen's company was publicly floated in 1972 and closed in 1975, when the archive was donated to the Victoria & Albert Museum. In the mid-1970s Stephen imported continental European designs for a new chain of shops, Francisco-M, and represented fashion franchises in the UK, including that for Lanvin. Stephen died in 2004. In his last interview, for Paul Gorman's fashion history The Look, Stephen said, \\"I was the same age and into pop music, so I gave kids something they could wear to complement that. There was nobody else around doing what I was doing, so I had it all to myself for a long time. Once others started coming through, all they could do was copy me.\\" In 2005, Westminster City Council unveiled a plaque at 1 Carnaby Street to commemorate Stephen's importance to London and his influence over fashion. ==References== ==Further reading== * Q, Special Edition: The Who. * Jeremy Reed, The King of Carnaby Street, Haus Publishing, London 2010, * Art & Hue collaboration with the estate of John Stephen. ==External links== * Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Glasgow Category:Clothing retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:1934 births ","title":"John Stephen"},{"id":"9092080","text":"Les Martys is a commune in the Aude department in southern France.

His original bent was towards foreign mission. After finishing his course at the University of Coimbra, he was ordained to the priesthood, and remained as professor of theology. So great was his reputation that King Sebastian of Portugal appointed him theologian at the Council of Trent, 1561. Here he merited the special thanks of the Pope by an able work in defense of the papal authority. While at the council he wrote his \\"Decem libri orthodoxarum explicationum\\" (Venice, 1564, 1594; Cologne, 1564, 1574) against the work of Martin Chemnitz, \\"Theologiae Jesuitarum praecipua capita\\". In this book he discusses and defines the chief points of doctrine attacked by the heretics. Chemnitz answered by his well-known \\"Examen Concilii Tridentini\\", in reply to which Andrada produced his best work, \\"Defensio Tridentinae fidei\\" (Lisbon, 1578 and 1595). tondo with bust of Diogo de Payva de Andrada, Lisbon workshop, ca. 1575, National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon Between 1562 and 1567, Diogo de Payva de Andrada published many controversial tracts, especially against the Lutheran, Martin Chemnitz. His first tract, De Societatis Jesu Origine, led to his being erroneously presumed a Jesuit. His De Conciliorum Auctoritate was welcomed at Rome as exalting the papal authority. Posthumous were his Defensio Tridentin√¶ fidei (1578) (remarkable for its learned statement of various opinions regarding the Immaculate Conception), and three sets of his sermons in Portuguese. He published also three volumes of sermons in Portuguese. Payva de Andrada had not only a grasp of theological questions which won for him an important position among sixteenth-century theologians, but he was also so clear and convincing in the exposition of his arguments that he proved an admirable apologist, and it was matter of regret that his death prevented the completion of his great work, the Defensio Tridentin√¶ fidei This had progressed as far as the fifth session, inclusive of the doctrine upon the Immaculate Conception in defense of which it marshalled an imposing array of authorities. Diego died, aged 47, at Lisbon. His nephew, Diogo, the younger (1586‚Äì1660), produced Chauleidos (1628) and other Latin poems, including sacred dramas, and a moral tract, Casamento Perfeito (1630); he also shone as an historical critic. ==Notes== ==ReferencesFootnotes=Bibliography=== * * * Category:1528 births Category:1575 deaths Category:Roman Catholic theologians Category:Portuguese theologians Category:Participants in the Council of Trent Category:People from Coimbra Category:16th-century Portuguese people Category:University of Coimbra alumni ","title":"Diogo de Paiva de Andrade"},{"id":"9092129","text":"Ron Shuebrook (born 1943 in Fort Monroe, Virginia) is a Canadian artist living in Toronto, Ontario. ==Work== Shuebrook exhibits his work nationally and internationally.

Between 1868 and 1945, three different barracks, a military hospital and a laundry occupied the site of today's \\"European quarter\\". ==Lindsey Air Station (1945‚Äì1993)== Map of Lindsey Air Station from the 1970s After World War II, the area was occupied by the US Army and renamed Camp Lindsey (after Captain Darrell R. Lindsey). U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE), however, retained a small presence at Lindsey Air Station. Lindsey AS was established as a U.S. Army Air Forces installation on 13 November 1946, became a U.S. Air Force installation in 1947, and achieved its greatest prominence between December 1953 and 14 March 1973 when it was the host base for USAFE Headquarters. On that date USAFE Headquarters moved to Ramstein Air Base. All of the streets in \\"Camp Lindsey\\" were named for the 31 American fatalities from \\"Operation Vittles,\\" the 1948-49 Berlin Airlift. From 1954 to 1973, Lindsey Air Station was, among other things, home to the 17th Air Force and the 65th Air Division. Wiesbaden Army Airfield and Wiesbaden Army Medical Center were administered from Lindsey. After the transfer of Wiesbaden Air Base to the Army in 1976, Lindsey provided a home base for other support activities. One of these was the 7100 Consolidated Equipment Maintenance and Support (CEMS) Squadron (1990 - 1993), whose role was to consolidate all war readiness materials (WRM) management in the European theater. This group transferred its base of operation to Sembach Air Base upon the close of Lindsey. Support for various other Air Force units in the Wiesbaden area continued until it was closed in 1993. United States Military Forces & Installations in Europe listed units at Lindsey as including the 7100th AB Wing, HQ, Air Force Technical Applications Center Europe, 7001st CSW, 701st ABG, 1st CCS, 1157th TCHOS, 1802nd Support Squadron, 1836th EIG, District 70 AFOSI, Det. 3 FTD, HQ ESAA, 2063rd Comm.

The buildings at Lindsey now house certain offices of the German Federal Investigation Bureau Bundeskriminalamt (red), the Hessen State Police (blue), a Folk high school (yellow), and new construction private housing (orange).

Provisional wings were created to provide air support to whatever operation was going on at the time. Real wings in the continental United States ('stateside') would supply aircraft and individuals to the provisional wing on a Temporary Duty (TDY) basis, with the aircraft and personnel returned to their home unit after the TDY period was over. The United States Air Force's Provisional Wings included several Strategic Wings created to support Strategic Air Command operations during the Gulf War of 1990‚Äì91. ==Practice during Vietnam War== During the Vietnam War, starting in 1965, SAC would deploy over two complete Bombardment Wings including Bombardment Squadrons, Air Refueling Squadrons, including the Maintenance & Support Squadrons and their personnel to Andersen AFB, Guam (B-52 Bomber and a few supporting tanker aircraft), Kadena AB, Okinawa, (B-52 Bomber & the Primary Tanker Aircraft Base) & Kung Kuan (Later renamed:) / Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan (A forward base for Tanker Operations) leaving a small caretaker force at the home base. The deployments were called Arc Light deployments. The first units deployed flew B-52F models that could carry 27 internal 500 lb bombs and 24 external 500 or 750 lb bombs for a total of 51 bombs, These were later replaced with the B-52D as they completed the Conventional Stores and weapons release modifications referred to as the \\"Big Belly\\" Modification. The \\"Big Belly aircraft were modified that 3 Internal Conventional Weapons Racks could be carried & released, increasing the weapons capability of 108 internal & external 500 lb bombs, depending on the targets requirements a mixture of 750 & 500 lb bombs were also carried, but there were too many configurations to list. The mission was considered so important that the wing on Guam at the time had to be manned 110% aircraft and personnel. Since no stateside wing was ever manned to 100% of its personnel, SAC HQ drew upon other stateside wings to send their personnel to augment the wing on Guam. A third B-52 base was added in 1966 at U-Tapao Royal Thai Naval Airfield, Thailand, using rotational aircraft and aircrews from Andersen AFB and Kadena AB. B-52's were withdrawn from Kadena in Sep 1970; and Andersen AFB reduced B-52 Operations to Maintenance and Alert Operations. The B-52D force were moved PCS to U-Tapao and the crew force was now shared by all Stateside B-52 Units (B-52G/H crews were required to attend a B-52D crew Replacement Training Course at Castle AFB, while en route to Thailand. This was standard operations until Jan 1972 when Linebacker I began and Guam became active in B-52 Combat Operations. When the primary wing on Guam came home, another wing was sent, with the second wing deploying about 14 days later, and because they were not at 100% some personnel might be tapped to augment that wing for another 179 days Temporary Duty. The 179 days was critical because any stay on excess of 179 days was considered a Permanent Change of Station. This policy at times was wavered with the approval of the Secretary of Defence mostly in 1972 with the requirement the PCS assignment would not be issued.

They are often baked for religious or cultural celebrations such as Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, Deepavali, birthdays and weddings. People in Malaysia practice an open house on festival day, and the modern layered cakes way be served in Sarawak. ==History== A layer cake served in Singapore The Sarawak layer cake has its origin in a form of layer cake with various spices found in Indonesia called lapis legit or kek lapis Betawi (Betawi refers to Batavia, the old name of Jakarta). This spiced Betawi cake is thought to have derived from a form of European spit cake, which was made by the wives of Dutch administrators in Batavia during the colonial period and served during evening tea. It is believed that this type of spiced layer cake was introduced to Sarawak in the 1970s and 1980s by the Betawis from Jakarta. The Sarawak people then added new ingredients, flavour and colour that resulted in a new version of the layer cake being introduced and named as Sarawak layer cake. In addition, modern Sarawak layered cakes were inspired by Western cake-making in the early 1980s, later modern design to the traditional layer cake, along with new flavours were introduced. ==Characteristics== Sarawakian modern layered cakes can be divided into two categories: cakes with ordinary layers and cakes with patterns, motifs, or shapes. All must have at least two colours. The cake can be baked in an oven or microwave. The batter uses butter or vegetable oil, milk and eggs, and requires a strong arm or electric mixer to be properly prepared. The baked cake has a high, firm texture and the layers are fastened together with jam or a similarly sticky sweet substance. More detailed cakes often require special moulds to maintain the perfect layer thickness. ==Protected geographical indication== In Malaysia, kek lapis Sarawak (Sarawak layer cake) has been a protected geographical indication since 2010.KEK LAPIS SARAWAK Geographical Indication at the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia This means that any product may only be called \\"kek lapis Sarawak/Sarawak layer cake\\" if it is manufactured in Sarawak according to the specifications of the Sarawak Layer Cake Manufacturers Association.

It is similar to the Indian Runner Duck, differing only in having a crest on the top of the head.Like almost all domesticated duck breeds, the Bali Duck originated from the Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos. The Bali Duck weighs around 2.25-2.75 kg (5-6 lb) with a slender, upright body. The body carriage is not as varied as that of the Indian Runner: Balis tend to vary between carrying their body at angle of 60-70 degrees to the ground whereas Indian Runners can be anywhere in the range of 45-75 degrees. The Bali has wider shoulders and heavier-set body than the Indian Runner, and a coarser head and bill shape. It can be clearly distinguished by the crest on the top of its head. The Bali Duck comes in a variety of standard colours, but the most common are white, brown and a Mallard colouring. It produces 120-250 eggs a year. These eggs are blue-green to white in colour. The Bali Duck is one of the oldest breeds of domestic duck. It is uncommon outside of Bali, and has not achieved the same success as the Indian Runner. Although it is a good layer, it has not been the subject of selective breeding for egg production (as the Indian Runner has), possibly because of the high in ovo mortality rate. The same gene responsible for producing the crest codes for a number of defects including back and balance problems, arched necks and complications in the formation of the skull that lead to death before hatching. On average one of every three offspring which survive hatching will lack the crest. A quarter of ducklings are killed by the lethal double-dose of the crested gene (which results in severe skull deformities) either before hatching, or soon after. The method routinely used in Bali for producing the largest number of viable ducks is to cross crested and non-crested specimens ‚Äî this results in a higher survival rate, and the number of crested offspring will statistically be 50%. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Duck breeds Category:Duck breeds originating in Indonesia ","title":"Bali duck"},{"id":"9092238","text":"The Seal of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the official symbol of the Nigerian President.

As described in detail in an editorial note, the idea of a treasure hunting story was prompted by a wish on the part of Manx politicians to promote tourism to the Isle of Man. Christie wrote a short story which was serialised in the Daily Dispatch in five instalments on 23, 24, 26, 27 and 28 May 1930.

Usually, Palden Lhamo refers to the Gelugpa version of her as a wrathful emanation of Saraswati, otherwise known as Magzor Gyalmo and Remati. Magzor Gyalmo was said to be named Remati during the time she was married to Shinje (Yama), in the form of the king of Lanka who ruled over the dudpos.https://books.google.com/books?id=_e3ACajL6TcC&lpg;=PA109&ots;=7Oconyi15j&dq;=dudpos&pg;=PA112#v=onepage&q;=dudpos&f;=false Page 112 Remati vowed that if she failed to convert the king to Buddhism, she would end his dynasty. She tried many times to convert him to avoiding the killing of dharma practitioners, but failed along with their son being raised to kill Buddhists. With no choice, she slaughtered her son while her husband was out hunting. She ate her son's flesh, drank his blood with his skull as a kapala or cup, and flayed his skin to become a saddle. Thus, she escaped out towards the north. Just as she left on a mule, the king returned and found out about his son's murder. Enraged, he shot the rump of the mule that Remati was riding. In response, Remati healed the wound and transformed it into an eye stating, \\"May the wound of my mount become an eye large enough to watch over the twenty-four regions, and may I myself be the one to extirpate the lineage of the malignant kings of Lanka!\\" There, she traveled onwards through India to Tibet to China to Mongolia and was said to have finally settled down on the mountain, Oikhan in eastern Siberia. Others myths say that when she died, she was reborn in hell and fought her way out of the hell, stealing a bag of diseases and a sword. When she escaped to the charnel grounds, she found no peace and prayed to the Buddha for a reason to live. The Buddha Vajradhara (tantric Shakyamuni) appeared before her and requested her to protect the dharma. Astonished, Remati agreed and thus arose as the dharmapala she is. Her retinue consists of the Lion-headed dakini Simhamukha(Sengdongma) behind her and the Makara-headed dakini Makaravaktra holding the reins of the mule in front of Palden Lhamo. Surrounding them are the 4 Goddesses of the Seasons, the 5 Sisters of Long Life, and the 12 Tenma goddesses. ==Palden Lhamo and the lake Lhamo La-tso== Palden Lhamo line drawing from the 1895 book Tibetan Buddhism by L.

The lake is sometimes referred to as \\"Palden Lhamo Kalideva\\", indicating that she is an emanation of the goddess Kali. The mountain to the south of Chokorgyel Monastery is the \\"blue\\" residence of Palden Lhamo, on which a sky burial site is located.Dowman, Keith. (1988).

Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, New York. . ==Description== She is the only female among the traditional 'Eight Guardians of the Law' and is usually depicted as deep blue in colour and with red hair to symbolise her wrathful nature, crossing a sea of blood riding side-saddle on a white mule. The mule has an eye on its left rump where her angry husband's arrow hit it after she killed her son (who was destined, and being raised to be the one to finally put an end to Buddhism) and used his skin as a saddle blanket. She has three eyes and is often shown drinking blood from a human skull. ==References== ==External links== *Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Palden Lhamo (see index) * Palden Lhamo * Images of Shri Devi at Himalayan Art Category:Dharmapalas Category:Vajrayana and women Category:Female buddhas and supernatural beings Category:Oracular deities Category:Tibetan Buddhist deities ","title":"Palden Lhamo"},{"id":"9092421","text":"David Aaron Shayman (September 21, 1980 ‚Äì January 23, 2007), better known by his stage name Disco D, was an American record producer and composer.

By 2005, he covered a wide range of music, such as Jamaican dancehall music and Maryland's Baltimore Club music. === Mobile music 2005=== Prior to 2005, most ring tones were based on polyphonic or even cruder monophonic tones because that was what most cell phone handsets could play. However, with snippets of existing songs and compositions generating more than $2 billion in annual worldwide revenues in 2005 as ring tones, cell phone handset manufacturers began producing handsets capable of replaying the upper and lower notes from a song's melody without tinny- sounding bleats. In early 2005, retailer Best Buy turned music Shayman had written for one of its commercials into a ring tone and offered it on the Best Buy website. From this, Shayman was one of the first to recognize the business potential in composing original ring tone material exclusively for cell phones and collaborated in 2005 with music producer Eddie O'Loughlin, and singer/songwriter Dee Robert in the new mobile music art form to produce original ring tones for Jamba!. === Kevin Federline work=== In 2005, Shayman produced \\"Y'all Ain't Ready\\", the first single from Britney Spears' then- husband Kevin Federline.Huhn, Mary.

Directed by Edmund Mortimer, the film's story was written by Reed Heustis, and written by Fanny and Frederic Hatton. The Wolf Man is now considered lost. == Plot == Gerald Stanley (John Gilbert) is an English gentleman who is engaged to Beatrice Joyce (Alma Frances). Stanley's personality changes whenever he drinks, and his brother (who also loves Beatrice) uses this to his advantage. After Stanley's latest blackout, his brother informs him that Stanley killed Beatrice's brother. The horrified Stanley flees from England and goes to live in Quebec. Once sober, Stanley stays away from liquor until he receives word that Beatrice has married his brother. The news sends him on a drinking spree and once again he turns beastly. In a saloon he gets in a fight and kidnaps Elizabeth Gordon (Norma Shearer), a respectable young girl who has wandered off from her father during a trip through the woods. Stanley takes Elizabeth to his shack, where he tries to force himself on her. His pursuers are closing in so he leaps in a canoe for a wild ride down the rapids. This sobers him up and, mortified by his actions, he apologizes profusely to Elizabeth.

Formed in 1988, the band reached the height of their popularity in the mid-1990s through constant touring and their lavish theme-based live shows. Chucklehead disbanded in 1997 following the release of their final album Belly Up. After a 17-year hiatus the band reunited in 2013 for several performances. ==HistoryFormation and move to Boston (1988‚Äì89)=== Chucklehead was formed in 1988 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Founding members include Eben Levy (guitar, vocals), Erik Atkisson (drums, vocals), Brian Gottesman (keyboards, vocals) and Burke Mamlin (bass, vocals). While at Wesleyan, the group recorded a 4-song demo, produced and engineered by Huck Bennert, a fellow Wesleyan student who would go on to produce most of the band's future recordings. Huck joined the band as tenor and baritone saxophonist, percussionist, and vocalist shortly after the recording. In 1989, the band added additional Wesleyan students Lennie Alkins (tenor sax, vocals), Rob Nahf (alto sax, vocals), and Paul Labay (trumpet). In 1989, the seniors in the group graduated and the entire band, except Mamlin and Labay, moved to Boston. Alkins and Gottesman stayed at Wesleyan, but commuted to Boston to write, record, and play shows in 1990. In Boston, the band was quickly fleshed out with Dave Rengel on bass and John Shachter on trumpet and vocals. ===The early years (1990‚Äì92)=== This 8-person incarnation of the band would go on to record the group's debut album Big Wet Kiss in 1992 and started a tradition of playing lavish theme-based shows like the Winter Wonderland and the Funk- Aquatic Convention, often involving sets and costumes. The band became an underground indie hit and was celebrated in publications like The Village Voice and a young Source Magazine for its groundbreaking mix of hip hop and live funk. The band served as an escapist, irreverent, and acerbic counterweight to the grunge music at the top of the Billboard charts at the time.Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1992 With the release of Big Wet Kiss, the band was featured on the MTV program Like We CareChucklehead ‚Äì Like We Care ‚Äì MTV Segment and started a heavy schedule of touring in the US, a schedule that never let up until the group played their final show in 1997. ===Lineup changes (1993‚Äì94) === In late 1993, Shachter and Nahf left the band. In 1994, while recording the band's second album Fuzz (at One World recording in Boston and Chun King in New York), Rengel and Alkins left the band. They were replaced by Mick Demopolous on bass and Meyer Statham on vocals and trombone. This new 6-person lineup would finish the recording of Fuzz (1994) and hit the road in support of the album. The new, leaner lineup deepened their focus on more raw, hard funk and continued to find new ways to fuse it with live hip hop. The band also continued its tradition of over-the-top themed shows, with tours like the Jungle Function. Songs from Fuzz were featured in the 1994 film Sleep with Me and in the 2000 film Love & Sex. ===Breakup (1997)=== In 1997, after 8 years on the road, playing over 125 shows a year, the band released their third album Belly Up and played their final show at Mama Kin Music Hall in Boston, MA. The track \\"God Damn\\" was featured in the 1998 film Some Girl. ===Hiatus (1998‚Äì2013)=== During their hiatus, the band and dedicated fans worked on compiling and archiving live recordings and videos. The resulting 100+ live shows on Archive.org have been downloaded over 400,000 times.Chucklehead on Archive.org ===Return (2013‚ÄìPresent)=== In the summer of 2013, seventeen years after the group's final 1997 sold-out show at Mama Kin in Boston MA, the band got back together and started performing again.Boston.com ‚Äì Chucklehead's funky reunion In July 2013, the band played The Middle East in Cambridge MA, one of the old haunts from their '90s run.

Thomas's eldest son and heir was Lemuel Gladwin, whose eventual heiress in the female line married a Mr Lord,Moore, p.611 whose descendants inherited the estate and made it their residence. His grandson was William Allwood Lord, Esq., who in 1817 was seated at Tupton Hall. One of the Lord family owners, a wealthy Chesterfield miller (after which family Lordsmill Street, Chesterfield was named) was robbed by a masked highwayman. He suspected his own coachman of having been the robber, but his other staff supported his alibi that he had been in the house at the time of the crime. Nevertheless, Lord had him tried, convicted and hanged. Before his execution the coachman laid a curse on the family and predicted \\"disaster upon disaster would follow\\". Shortly before 1893 the family sold the estate and at that time a distant cousin Rev. Henry Gladwin Jebb, descended in the female line from Major-General Henry Gladwin (d.1791), purchased ten Gladwin family portraits formerly hanging in Tupton Hall, including one of Thomas Gladwin dated 1672, and some family silver-plate also dated 1672.Moore, p.611 In 1929 Derbyshire Education Committee purchased Tupton Hall and its 52-acre park. In 1938 the house was destroyed in a fire, soon after an ornamental plaster ceiling by Robert Adam was refurbished, and the remains were demolished soon after.

The pupil of Karel Rosier, who was a Vice-Kapellmeister at Bonn, de Fesch later married his daughter, Maria Anna Rosier. De Fesch was active in Amsterdam between 1710 and 1725. From 1725 to 1731 he served as Kapellmeister at Antwerp Cathedral. Thereafter he moved to London where he gave concerts and played the violone in Handel's orchestra in 1746. In 1748 and 1749 he conducted at Marylebone Gardens. He apparently made no public appearances after 1750. His works included the oratorios Judith (1732) and Joseph (1746), as well as chamber duets, solo and trio sonatas, concertos and part songs. Both oratorios were thought lost until 1980 when a copy of a manuscript of Joseph was found in London's Royal Academy of Music.Dutch Treat De Fesch's music was influenced by the Italians, particularly Vivaldi, as well as Handel. ==Works== *Op. 1: 6 Sonate per 2 Violini e 6 Sonate per due Cioloncelli (Roger/Amsterdam 1715) *Op. 2: Molti Concerti e Concerti grossi (Roger/Amsterdam 1717) *Op. 3: Molti Concerti e Concerti grossi (Roger/Amsterdam 1718) *Op. 4: 6 Sonate per Violino e Basso continuo (B. c.), 6 Sonate per 2 violoncelli (1725) *Op. 5: Concerti e Concerti grossi (Le C√®ne/Amsterdam 1725) *Op. 6: Sonate per Strumento solo con B. c.

The agency also has responsibility for fostering the safe use of the state's waters through a program of law enforcement, education, and access. The TWRA is engaged in hunter education and training through the Tennessee Hunter Education Program and provides support to the \\"Archery in the Schools Program\\" and financial support to safety and competitive shooting programs through the Tennessee Wildlife Federation's Tennessee Scholastic Clay Target Program. ==History and organization== The role of the TWRA was originally handled by various state agencies and departments until 1949, when the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission was set up as an independent agency. In 1974, the Game and Fish Commission was reorganized as the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. The TWRA is governed by the 13-member Tennessee Wildlife Resources Commission, whose members are citizens appointed by the governor, the speaker of the state house, and the speaker of the state senate. Each county in the state is assigned at least one uniformed TWRA officer. The state is divided into four administrative regions, with offices in Jackson, Nashville (also the location of the headquarters), Crossville and Morristown. Each region is itself divided into a number of law enforcement areas (typically three), headed by a law enforcement supervisor and an assistant supervisor that oversee and coordinate the activities of the officers in their area. ==Law enforcement== TWRA officers are tasked with enforcing state and federal game and non-game wildlife regulations, including hunting, fishing and trapping. The TWRA is also responsible for enforcing all boating laws (such as patrolling for intoxicated boaters, checking for correct boat registration, and enforcement of safety regulations) and maintaining public boat access areas. Although TWRA officers concentrate on wildlife-related law enforcement and rarely are called to enforce other laws, they carry not only state-level commissions, but commissions granted by the federal government as well, giving them the ability and responsibility to enforce all state, local, and federal codes. ==Conservation and other activities== The TWRA takes an active role in wildlife and fisheries conservation and the reintroduction of wildlife that were driven from an area due to human intervention. Recent conservation activities included the successful reintroduction of wild turkeys to West and Middle Tennessee, as well as a successful elk reintroduction program in East Tennessee. The TWRA manages over of forested land for public hunting and wildlife research. The TWRA maintains a modern forensics laboratory at the University of Tennessee, Martin that includes state of the art DNA analysis equipment. TWRA officers are often called to provide assistance in search and rescue operations, due to their extensive experience working in woodland environments. TWRA officers also are included in Department of Homeland Security training as first responders and anti-terrorism enforcement officials. TWRA officers were sent to the Gulf Coast to provide assistance to local law enforcement and rescue teams in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ===Tennessee Hunter Education Program=== Since 1985, Tennessee has required completion of the Tennessee Hunter Education Program (THEP) as a prerequisite to obtaining a hunting permit in the state for all persons born on or after January 1, 1969. All hunters over the age of 10 are required to be in possession of a Hunter Education certificate while in the field, and those under 10 must be accompanied by an adult of at least 21 years of age who has completed the course and who must remain in a position to take immediate control of the hunting device. The course is offered free of charge and consists of a minimum of 10 hours of classroom participation, although most courses generally last 12‚Äì16 hours. Students are then required to successfully pass a written examination and a live firing exercise. The course contains instruction on ethics, marksmanship, history of hunting and firearms, wildlife management and identification, laws, knowledge of firearms and ammunition, wilderness survival, emergency first aid, etc. The THEP was established as a formal hunter education program in 1975. According to the TWRA, since its institution hunting and firearm related accidents in Tennessee have declined dramatically. Hunter safety certification via the THEP is recognized by all states, Canada and Mexico. ===Tennessee Scholastic Clay Target Program=== In 2001, the TWRA partnered with the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the Tennessee Wildlife Federation to institute the Tennessee Scholastic Clay Target Program. This program is designed to provide elementary- to college- aged students in Tennessee with opportunities to compete in clay target shooting sports with their peers across the state. These programs are usually organized as school-endorsed athletic programs, however teams are also organized through 4-H clubs, Boy and Girl Scout Troops, or community groups. The program draws over 1,000 youth annually to the state championships. ==See also== * List of law enforcement agencies in Tennessee * List of State Fish and Wildlife Management Agencies in the U.S. ==References== ==External links== * Category:State wildlife and natural resource agencies of the United States Wildlife Resources Agency Wildlife Resources Agency ","title":"Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency"},{"id":"9092545","text":"Industrial area may refer to: * Industrial district * Industrial park * Industrial region ==See also== * Industrial Area (Doha) ","title":"Industrial area"},{"id":"9092569","text":"The following articles contain lists of professional bodybuilders: *List of female professional bodybuilders *List of male professional bodybuilders *List of British bodybuilders *List of German bodybuilders ","title":"Lists of professional bodybuilders"},{"id":"9092572","text":"Derekh eretz or derech eretz (Hebrew: ◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ê◊®◊•, literally \\"the way of the land\\") is the term used for \\"proper behaviour\\".

The two are in her one- room walk-up apartment in the west side of Manhattan. Johnny (originated by F. Murray Abraham), a short order cook, is in good physical condition; but Frankie (originated by Kathy Bates), a waitress, is frumpy, fat, and emotionally defined by her unattractiveness. Johnny is certain he has found his soul mate in Frankie. She, on the other hand, is far more cautious and disinclined to jump to conclusions and at first has written off the encounter as a one night stand. As the night unfolds, they slowly begin to reveal themselves to each other as they take tentative steps towards the possible start of a new relationship.

The screenplay by Laird Doyle and Wallace Smith is based on Robert Lord's adaptation of the 1934 novel Border Town by Carroll Graham. The supporting cast features Margaret Lindsay, Eugene Pallette and Robert Barrat. Although the films They Drive by Night (1940) and Blowing Wild (1953) are not specifically remakes of Bordertown, they include many of its plot elements and similar scenes. ==Plot== After graduating from Pacific Night Law School in Los Angeles, feisty and ambitious Mexican American Johnny Ramirez loses his first court case because he is ill-prepared. His poor, Hispanic client's truck was destroyed by careless debutante Dale Elwell. Johnny is harassed by the opposing attorney, uppercrust Brook Manville, who is defending his lover, Elwell. Johnny reacts, losing his temper and the case. Disbarred for his actions, he journeys to a small town south of the border and finds work as a bouncer, in a seedy casino owned by Charlie Roark. Johnny helps transform the dive into a first-class nightclub called the Silver Slipper that attracts an upscale crowd, and Charlie makes him a partner to reward him for his efforts. Charlie's lonely, unhappily married wife Marie makes a play for Johnny, who resists her advances. Certain Johnny has shunned her simply because she is married, she locks her inebriated husband in the garage and leaves the car running, asphyxiating him. Dale Elwell and her society friends, including Brook Manville, visit the club and Johnny becomes infatuated with her. A jealous Marie accuses Johnny of murdering Charlie, but when called to testify at his trial, she collapses on the witness stand, having become insane. Johnny returns to Los Angeles and proposes to Dale, who contemptuously rejects him, citing the dramatic differences in their ethnic and economic backgrounds, then is hit and killed by a car trying to get away from him. Johnny decides to sell the Silver Slipper, donate the proceeds to a law school, and settle in Los Angeles among his own people. ==Production== Bordertown was one of the first films to come under the close scrutiny of the Hays Office, which finally was enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code introduced in 1930 to limit content seen as controversial or salacious. In the original script, Johnny Ramirez was disbarred for committing murder and had an affair with Marie Roark, two plot elements that had to be revised before the screenplay was approved.Bordertown at Turner Classic Movies Leading man Paul Muni wanted either Carole Lombard or Lupe V√©lez as his co-star, but after hearing the positive feedback his contract player Bette Davis was receiving for her performance in Of Human Bondage, which was in production at RKO, studio head Jack L. Warner decided to cast her in the role of Marie Roark. \\"The part of Marie was an excellent acting part - a step in the direction of where I wanted my career to go\\", Davis later recalled. \\"I wanted to be known as an actress, not necessarily a star, although that would be the frosting on the cake if it should ever come about.\\"Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis. New York: Hawthorn Books 1974. , pp. 55-57 After murdering her husband, Marie undergoes a gradual mental deterioration, culminating in a collapse in the courtroom. Director Archie Mayo expected Davis to deliver a histrionic performance, but the actress, whose own sister suffered from a mental disorder, insisted a subtle portrayal of the breakdown was more appropriate and accurate.Higham, Charles, The Life of Bette Davis. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1981. , p. 69 \\"When I firmly and sincerely believed I should play my role a certain way, I wasn't afraid to argue about it with my director\\", Davis remembered. \\"They wanted me to be a raving lunatic in the courtroom scene, pull my hair, and scream. That is the only way insanity had been played on the screen up to that time.\\" After the film was completed, studio executives felt viewers would fail to realize Marie was insane and insisted Davis re-shoot the scene. She agreed she would do so only if preview audiences did not realize the character had descended into madness. \\"I was never asked to do a retake\\", Davis recalled. ==Cast== *Paul Muni as Johnny Ramirez *Bette Davis as Marie Roark *Margaret Lindsay as Dale Elwell *Eugene Pallette as Charlie Roark *Robert Barrat as Padre *Soledad Jiminez as Mrs. Ramirez *Hobart Cavanaugh as Harry *Gavin Gordon as Brook Manville *William Davidson as Dr. Carte *Oscar Apfel as Judge Rufus Barnswell (uncredited) *Wade Boteler as Buying Casino Man (uncredited) *Chris-Pin Martin as Jos√© (uncredited) *George Regas as Guillermo (uncredited) *Arthur Treacher as Roberts (uncredited) ==Critical reception== Andre Sennwald of The New York Times called the film \\"a raw and biting melodrama dealing with the bitterly realistic emotions\\" that permits Paul Muni \\"to scrape the nerves in the kind of taut and snarling role at which he is so consummately satisfying\\" and to display \\"his great talent for conviction and theatrical honesty.\\" He cited the \\"fine and uncommonly honest performance\\" of Bette Davis, who he found to be \\"effective and touching in pathological mazes which the cinema rarely dares to examine.\\" While he thought Johnny's \\"feeble confessional at the conclusion of Bordertown is an unconvincing and inconsistent denouement for the career of such a vigorous rebel against the established order\\", he felt the film \\"otherwise manages to impale the spectator's attention before the picturesque and somewhat hysterical materials of the story.\\"The New York Times review ==Box Office== According to Warner Bros records the film earned $891,000 domestically and $346,000 foreign. ==References* Category:1935 films Category:1935 romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Mexico Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Archie Mayo Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Melodramas Category:1935 drama films ","title":"Bordertown (1935 film)"},{"id":"9092679","text":"Yang Lihua (; 561‚Äì609) was an empress of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Zhou, and later a princess of Sui Dynasty. Her husband was Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou (Yuwen Yun), and her father was Yang Jian who later usurped the Northern Zhou throne to become the Emperor Wen of Sui. ==Background== Yang Lihua was born in 561, as the oldest child of Yang Jian, then the heir apparent to Yang Zhong (Ê•äÂø†) the Duke of Sui, and Yang Jian's wife Dugu Qieluo. In 568, her grandfather Yang Zhong died, and her father Yang Jian inherited the title of Duke of Sui. In fall 573, Emperor Wu took her as the wife to Yuwen Yun, then his crown prince, and she thereafter carried the title of crown princess. He was 14 and she was 12. In summer 578, Emperor Wu died, and Yuwen Yun took the throne (as Emperor Xuan). He created her empress. (She bore him no sons and one daughter, Yuwen Eying (ÂÆáÊñáÂ®•Ëã±), although Yuwen Eying's birth year is not clear.)https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%A8%E4%B8%BD%E5%8D%8E/21528?fr=aladdin == As Empress of Zhou == Emperor Xuan was excessive and erratic in his behavior, and less than a year after taking the throne, in spring 579, he formally passed the throne to his son Yuwen Chan (as Emperor Jing), born of his concubine Consort Zhu Manyue. He took an atypical title for a retired emperor -- \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂ∏ù, Tianyuan Huangdi). She thereafter took the title of \\"Empress Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂêé, Tianyuan Huanghou). However, as part of his unusual behavior, he soon decided that he would create four empresses, so he created three of his concubines‚ÄîConsort Zhu, Consort Chen Yueyi, and Consort Yuan Leshang‚Äîempress titles as well, but different from Empress Yang's to distinguish them. (Empress Zhu was Tianyuan Di Hou (Â§©ÂÖÉÂ∏ùÂêé); Empress Chen was Tian Zhuo Huanghou (Â§©Â∑¶ÁöáÂêé); and Empress Yuan was Tian You Huanghou (Â§©Âè≥ÁöáÂêé).) However, Empress Yang continued to be recognized as the most honored among his empresses. (He later added one more empress, Empress Yuchi Chifan.) In spring 580, he added Da (Â§ß, \\"great\\") to the empresses' titles, and therefore Empress Yang's title was changed to Tianyuan Da Huanghou (Â§©ÂÖÉÂ§ßÁöáÂêé). It was said that Empress Yang was meek and not jealous, and that she was loved and respected by the other four empresses and the other imperial consorts. As Emperor Xuan grew increasingly erratic and violent, on one occasion, he got angry at Empress Yang and wanted to punish her. When he summoned her, however, she was relaxed but firm in her defense of herself, which angered him more, and he ordered her to commit suicide. When her mother Lady Dugu heard of this, she rushed to the palace and prostrated herself, begging Emperor Xuan for mercy. His anger dissipated, and he pardoned Empress Yang. Emperor Xuan fell suddenly ill in summer 580, and Yang Jian entered the palace to attend to him. Emperor Xuan died without being able to leave instructions, and his close associate Zheng Yi (ÈÑ≠Ë≠Ø), a friend of Yang Jian's, issued an edict in Emperor Xuan's name appointing Yang Jian regent. Empresses Yang and Zhu were honored as dowager empresses, with Empress Yang taking the primary title of Huang Taihou (ÁöáÂ§™Âêé). She was initially happy to hear that her father had become regent, but became apprehensive and displeased at her father when she sensed that he had designs on the throne, although she made no overt attempts to stop him. After defeating the generals Yuchi Jiong (Empress Yuchi's grandfather) and Sima Xiaonan (Âè∏È¶¨Ê∂àÈõ£) later in 580 after they had risen against him, Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing in spring 581, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen created Emperor Jing the Duke of Jie, and while it was unclear what Empress Dowager Yang's title was at this point, it was likely she carried the title of Duchess Dowager of Jie. Emperor Wen soon slaughtered Emperor Jing and the other members of Northern Zhou's imperial Yuwen clan. == As Princess Leping of Sui == In 586, Emperor Wen changed the former Empress Yang's title to Princess Leping. She was, however, resentful of her father's usurpation, and often expressed her anger and grief. Emperor Wen tried to get her to remarry, but she refused. Later, she selected, for her daughter Yuwen Eying's husband, Li Min (ÊùéÊïè) the Duke of Guangzong‚Äîwho was raised in the palace on account of his father, the general Li Chong (ÊùéÂ¥á), having died in battle against Tujue in 583. When the wedding occurred, Emperor Wen authorized that the ceremony be as grand as if a princess were to be married. When Emperor Wen subsequently summoned Li Min, intending to give him a mid-level official position, the Princess Leping advised him to not thank the emperor until and unless the emperor bestowed him the high rank of Zhuguo (Êü±Âúã) (second rank, first division, under Sui's nine- rank system). When Emperor Wen initially stated that he was going to give him the rank of Yitong (fourth rank, first division), Li therefore said nothing. Emperor Wen then mentioned Kaifu (ÈñãÂ∫ú, third rank, second division), and Li still said nothing. Emperor Wen finally said, \\"The Princess has achieved so much for me. How can I be stingy as to her son-in-law? I will make you a Zhuguo.\\" Only then did Li bow and thank the emperor. Emperor Wen died in 604, and was succeeded by Yang Lihua's brother Yang Guang (as Emperor Yang). The princess often attended to her brother, but on one occasion became a source of friction between him and his son Yang Jian (note different character than his grandfather) the Prince of Qi, as once she told Emperor Yang that a daughter of the Liu clan was beautiful, but Emperor Yang initially took no action. She then offered the woman to Yang Jian, who took her as a concubine. When Emperor Yang subsequently asked her about Lady Yang, she stated that she had already given her to Yang Jian, which brought displeasure to Emperor Yang. In 609, while accompanying Emperor Yang on a visit to Zhangye, Yang Lihua grew ill, and she asked Emperor Yang to transfer her fief (five times the size of a usual ducal fief) to Li, stating that she was concerned for her daughter and therefore wanted her son-in-law to have her fief. Emperor Yang agreed, and did so after she died thereafter. However, in 615, when Emperor Yang became suspicious of Li Min over popular rumors that the next emperor would be from the Li clan, he had his associate Yuwen Shu investigate the matter. Yuwen Shu persuaded Yuwen Eying that Li Min and his uncle Li Hun (ÊùéÊ∏æ) (who had previously offended Yuwen Shu by refusing to pay Yuwen Shu a bribe that he had promised) were beyond help, and that she needed to save herself‚Äîand therefore got her to submit a confession stating that members of the Li clan were planning a coup to support Li Min as emperor. When Emperor Yang saw the confession, he believed the truth thereof, and he executed Li Hun, Li Min, and 30 other members of their clan. Several months later, Yuwen Eying was also poisoned to death. ==References== Category:Northern Zhou empresses Category:Chinese princesses Category:Sui dynasty people Category:561 births Category:609 deaths Category:7th-century Chinese women Category:7th-century Chinese people Category:6th-century Chinese women Category:6th-century Chinese people ","title":"Yang Lihua"},{"id":"9092692","text":"Sifre Zutta () is a midrash on the Book of Numbers. Medieval authors mention it under the titles \\"Sifre shel Panim Acherim\\" and \\"Vi-Yeshallehu Zutta\\"; and to distinguish from it the Sifre, Or Zarua2:22 calls the latter \\"Sifre Rabbati.\\" The Sifre Zutta has not been preserved; and apparently was no longer extant by the time of Abraham Bakrat (around 1500).It was no longer extant at the time Bakrat wrote his commentary on Rashi; compare Br√ºll, Der Kleine Sifre, in Gr√§tz Jubelschrift, p. 184 However, fragments of Sifre Zutta have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza, and excerpts from it are quoted in the Midrash HaGadol and in Yalkut Shimoni.Zvi Meir Rabinowitz, Introduction to Midrash HaGadol (Book of Numbers), Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1983 (4th printing), pp. 7‚Äì8 (Hebrew). == Quotations in other early works == Earlier authors knew of it and occasionally quoted it, e.g., R. Samson of Sens in his commentary on the mishnaic orders Zera'im and ·π¨ohorot. Numerous fragments are found in Yalkut Shimoni to Book of Numbers.Collated by Br√ºll (l.c.); corrections and additions by D. Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p. 60. Quotations are found also in Numbers Rabbah to Naso.Abraham Epstein, Mi-·∏≤admoniyyot ha-Yehudim, p. 71 The \\"Mekhilta to Numbers\\" frequently quoted by Maimonides in his Sefer ha-Mitzvot is identical to the Sifre Zutta; for all his quotations may be identified among the fragments of the Sifre contained in the Yal·∏≥u·π≠ Shimoni, except a single passage in Shoresh 11 referring to a Biblical section, on which Yalkut Shimoni has not quoted the Sifre.as Hoffmann shows (l.c. p. 59) by comparison with the Arukh Maimonides frequently drew upon the Sifre Zutta in his Yad ha-Hazakah also. Other medieval authors who occasionally quoted it are mentioned by Br√ºll.l.c. pp. 180 et seq. The Midrash HaGadol to Numbers quotes the majority of the Sifre Zutta, and has recently become a source of information concerning the latter. Around 1900, K√∂nigsberger began to edit the Sifre Zutta on the basis of the extracts in the Midrash ha-Gadol and Yalkut Shimoni. A small fragment of the Sifre has been published by Solomon Schechter.In J. Q. R. vi. 656-663 == From the School of R. Akiva == The Sifre Zutta belongs to Rabbi Akiva's school, as is indicated by the method of exposition; e.g., that of the double expressions in Numbers 35:21; of the partitive ◊û◊ü (Numbers 15:19); and of the ◊ï (Numbers 5:2); the phrases Sifra Tzav 2:1 and Sifra Emor 7:8 (i.e. = ) as in the Sifra. There are also other points of similarity with the Sifra;D. Hoffmann, l.c. p. 69 e.g., the terminology in part, as ; although there are some unusual expressions, as and for and for . Furthermore, some of the views expressed in the Sifre Zutta correspond with views known to be R. Akiva's, as in 5:14,Compare Sotah 3a and 5:15.Compare Sifre, Numbers 8 The midrash may be assigned to Simeon bar Yochai rather than to Judah bar Ilai (as is done in the case of the Sifra), although perhaps some of the anonymous halakhot, such as 5:15Compare Nedarim 35b and 15:4Compare Menachot 104b express Judah's views. R. Simeon's authorship is indicated by the fact that he is mentioned least often in the midrash, and that of the later tannaim R. Eleazar b. Simeon is mentioned a few times. There are additional indications pointing to Simeon's authorship, as, for example, the enumeration of the positive and negative commandments, which is said to be a characteristic of the Sifre to Deuteronomy, this midrash also being ascribed to Simeon. Further evidence is presented by the correspondence of various halakot with R. Simeon's views. Aside from the passages quoted by D. Hoffmann,l.c. p. 65 some of which represent Simeon's views more exactly than others‚Äîthe parallel between 5:7 and Mekhilta Mishpatim 15 is doubtful, on account of the different readings in the Mekilta‚Äîstill others must be taken into account; e.g., Sifre Zutta 5:21 compared with Tosefta, Shevuot 3:7; 6:20, with Nazir 46a;Compare K√∂nigsberger, Der Kleine Sifre, p. 14b, note 63, and p. 24, note 128 and, what is especially characteristic, the reason for the law under consideration () is inquired into, as in 5:15 and 19:16.Compare Tosefta Shevuot 1:7; Yerushalmi Nazir 56b The well-known reference of the Talmud, ,Sanhedrin 86a may therefore apply to Sifre Zutta, in which, furthermore, there are several exegetical notes on passages of Book of Numbers mentioned in the Talmud, but which are not found in the larger Sifre.Compare Hoffmann, l.c. pp. 56 et seq. The fact that the Sifre Zutta to 5:27 contradicts R. Simeon's viewIn Sotah 19a shows merely that the editor drew also upon other midrashim, including, perhaps, that of R. Eliezer ben Jacob and that of R. Ishmael.Compare Sifre Zutta to Numbers 35:21 with Yerushalmi Makkot 31d Noteworthy are the terms and for , which are known to have been used by Eliezer ben Jacob.Zevachim 91b, according to the correct reading; Sifre, Deut. 195; comp. Hoffmann, l.c. p. 65, note 1; K√∂nigsberger, l.c. p. 5, note 7 The fact that R. Judah haNasi is not mentioned leads Hoffmann to the conclusion that the Sifre Zutta was not edited by a student of Judah. Some tannaim are mentioned therein whose names are not found elsewhere; e.g., Simeon ben Nehunyon and Papyas of Ono. By 1900, the Sifre Zutta had not yet been thoroughly studied. ==References== * === Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === Besides the authorities quoted in the text: *W. Bacher, in J. Q.

(formerly Orbital Imaging Corporation, or ORBIMAGE) was an American commercial satellite imagery company based in Herndon, Virginia. GeoEye was merged into the DigitalGlobe corporation January 29, 2013. The company was founded in 1992 as a division of Orbital Sciences Corporation in the wake of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business. The division was spun off in 1997. It changed its name to GeoEye in 2006 after acquiring Denver, Colorado-based Space Imaging Corporation for $58 million. Space Imaging was founded and controlled by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Its principal asset was the IKONOS satellite; the company was founded in the 1990s for the purpose of managing the project that became the IKONOS satellite. Although ORBIMAGE's first chairman was Orbital chairman David W. Thompson, and Orbital at the time owned more than 60 percent of the stock, it no longer has a substantial interest in the company or its successor. GeoEye provided of satellite map images to Microsoft and Yahoo! search engines. In 2008 Google secured exclusive online mapping use of the GeoEye-1 satellite. GeoEye maintained major contracts with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for the provision of reconnaissance and imagery data. In the early twenty-first century GeoEye was headquartered in Herndon, Virginia. Satellite Operations were conducted from Herndon and Thornton, Colorado. The location in St. Louis, Missouri provided additional image processing. Multiple ground stations were located worldwide. In 2011, GeoEye was inducted into the Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth- imaging satellites. GeoEye was purchased by DigitalGlobe in 2013. ==SatellitesOrbView 1=== OrbView 1 (MicroLab 1, COSPAR 1995-017C) was a small, 68 kg satellite built by Orbital Sciences Corporation for a collaboration between ORBIMAGE and NASA. It had a payload of 2 sensors, one from NASA and another from University Consortium for Atmospheric Research, sponsored by National Science Foundation. The collaboration had NASA provide the instruments and ORBIMAGE was in charge of operating them for research purposes for NASA and other academic instances. The sensors studied lightning in the atmosphere and the use of GPS signals in atmospheric studies. It was launched 3 April 1995 from Vandenberg AFB by a Pegasus H rocket.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/orbview-1.htm ===IKONOS=== Launched in 1999 by Space Imaging, IKONOS collected panchromatic and multispectral data at a rate of over per minute. IKONOS orbited the Earth every 98 minutes at an altitude of approximately . It traveled a sun-synchronous orbit, passing a given longitude at 10:30 a.m. local time. IKONOS was operated out of Thornton, Colorado. It derived its name from the Greek term eik≈çn (pronounced eikona) for image. IKONOS was retired on March 31, 2015, having performed for more than twice its life expectancy. === OrbView-2 === The OrbView-2 satellite (COSPAR 1997-037A), also called SeaStar, was launched 1 August 1997 by ORBIMAGE on a Pegasus XL rocket from Vandenberg AFB. OrbView-2 collected color imagery of the Earth's entire land and ocean surfaces on a daily basis. Commercial fishing vessels used OrbView-2 data for detecting oceanographic conditions used to create fishing maps. The satellite also provided broad-area coverage in swaths, which were routinely used in naval operations, environmental monitoring, and global crop assessment applications. OrbView-2 carried NASA's SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) sensor. OrbView-2 was operated out of Dulles, Virginia, but operations ceased shortly before GeoEye's HQ relocation to Herndon, Virginia in 2011. It stopped collecting data on 11 December 2010, after 13 years (design life was 5 years). It had a mass of 309 kg and was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/orbview-2.htm ===OrbView-3=== Launched 26 June 2003 by ORBIMAGE, OrbView-3 (COSPAR 2003-030A) commercial Earth observation satellite acquired panchromatic and multispectral imagery in an 8-kilometer-wide swath. The satellite collected up to of imagery each day. It revisited each location on Earth in less than three days with the ability to collect data up to 50 degrees off nadir. Similar to IKONOS, this satellite passed a given longitude at 10:30 a.m. local time. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg AFB by a Pegasus XL rocket. The satellite had a mass of 304 kg and was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation for ORBIMAGE. It carried an OHRIS (OrbView High Resolution Imaging System) payload designed and built by Northrop Grumman. Similar sensor was in OrbView 4 satellite. On April 23, 2007, GeoEye, Inc. filed a Form 8-K to announce that its OrbView-3 satellite is permanently out of service. Though GeoEye remained in control of the satellite, it no longer produced usable imagery (the imaging sensor failed 4 March 2007). The spacecraft decayed on March 13, 2011 via a controlled reentry into Pacific Ocean.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/orbview-3.htm ===OrbView 4=== OrbView 4 was a high-resolution commercial Earth imaging satellite that was lost in launch failure. It would have recorded panchromatic and multispectral imagery in an 8-kilometer-wide swath, like OrbView-3, and it also would have provided 200 channel hyperspectral imagery. It was to revisit every location on Earth in less than 3 days. The main instrument OHRIS (OrbView High Resolution Imaging System) was built by Northrop Grumman. The satellite bus was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation. The mass of the satellite was 368 kg. It was lost in a launch failure on 21 September 2001 when the Taurus rocket suffered a loss of control, from which it recovered, but orbit was not achieved.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/orbview-4.htm ===GeoEye-1=== GeoEye-1 (Former name OrbView 5) launched on September 6, 2008 at 11:50:57 a.m. PDT (1850:57 UTC). The satellite separated successfully from its Delta II launch vehicle at 12:49 p.m. PDT (1949 UTC), 58 minutes and 56 seconds after launch. The satellite provides panchromatic and 1.65-meter multispectral imagery in 15.2 km swaths. The spacecraft is intended for a sun- synchronous orbit at an altitude of and an inclination of 98 degrees, with a 10:30 a.m. equator crossing time. GeoEye-1 can image up to 60 degrees off nadir. It is operated out of Herndon, Virginia and was built in Arizona by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems. ===GeoEye-2=== The GeoEye-2 satellite is designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of , and multispectral images at . The spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin, while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation. Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required. It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in 2016. WorldView-4 launched on 11 November 2016. ==Aerial imagery== GeoEye expanded into aerial imagery in March 2007, with the purchase of MJ Harden from General Electric Company. MJ Harden, based in Mission, Kansas, is now a wholly owned subsidiary that operates two aircraft that carry a digital mapping camera (DMC) and a sophisticated LiDAR imaging system. MJ Harden was founded by Milton J. Harden in 1956 to provide photogrammetry services. GE Power Systems bought the company in 2003. ==Regional affiliates== * Space Imaging Middle East ==References== ==External links== * GeoFUSE Archive Search and Discovery Tools - Search for GeoEye satellite imagery online * GeoEye Image Gallery * GeoEye Foundation Category:Companies based in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Herndon, Virginia Category:Technology companies established in 1992 Category:Cerberus Capital Management companies Category:2013 mergers and acquisitions Category:Remote sensing companies ","title":"GeoEye"},{"id":"9092709","text":"Events from the year 1930 in the United Kingdom. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì George V * Prime Minister ‚Äì Ramsay MacDonald (Labour) * Parliament ‚Äì 35th ==Events== R101 in flight * 1 January ‚Äì the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain begins publishing a newspaper, the Morning Star. * 1 February ‚Äì The Times publishes its first crossword. * March ‚Äì fitness organisation the Women's League of Health and Beauty set up by Mary Bagot Stack; by 1939 it will have over 100,000 members.'' * 9 March ‚Äì the British Broadcasting Corporation opens its second high-power medium-wave transmitter at Brookmans Park, north of London, and with it launches its \\"Regional Scheme\\" which sees station 5XX renamed as the National Programme while 2LO becomes the London Regional Programme. * April ‚Äì John Gielgud plays the title role of Hamlet for the first time, at The Old Vic in London. * 1 April ‚Äì Poor law unions and workhouses abolished under the Local Government Act 1929, responsibility for public assistance transferring to local authorities and workhouses becoming hospitals or public assistance institutions under their control. * 18 April ‚Äì BBC radio listeners uniquely hear the announcement \\"Good evening.

The third derivative of a function f(x)=y can be denoted by :\\\\frac{d^3y}{dx^3},\\\\quad f(x),\\\\quad\\\\text{or }\\\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[f(x)]. Other notations can be used, but the above are the most common. ==Mathematical definitions== Let f(x)=x^4. Then f'(x)=4x^3, and f(x)=12x^2. Therefore, the third derivative of f(x) is, in this case, : f(x)=24x or, using Leibniz notation, : \\\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[x^4]=24x Now for a more general definition. Let f(x) be any function of x. Then the third derivative of f(x) is given by the following: : \\\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[f(x)]=\\\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] The third derivative is the rate at which the second derivative (f(x)) is changing. ==Applications in geometry== In differential geometry, the torsion of a curve ‚Äî a fundamental property of curves in three dimensions ‚Äî is computed using third derivatives of coordinate functions (or the position vector) describing the curve. ==Applications in physics== In physics, particularly kinematics, jerk is defined as the third derivative of the position function of an object. It is, essentially, the rate at which acceleration changes. In mathematical terms: : \\\\mathbf{j}(t)=\\\\frac{d^3\\\\mathbf{r}}{dt^3} where j(t) is the jerk function with respect to time, and r(t) is the position function of the object with respect to time. ==Economic example== When campaigning for a second term in office, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the rate of increase of inflation was decreasing, which has been noted as \\"the first time a sitting president used the third derivative to advance his case for reelection.\\" Since inflation is itself a derivative‚Äîthe rate at which the purchasing power of money decreases‚Äîthen the rate of increase of inflation is the derivative of inflation, opposite in sign to the second time derivative of the purchasing power of money. Stating that a function is decreasing is equivalent to stating that its derivative is negative, so Nixon's statement is that the second derivative of inflation is negative, and so the third derivative of purchasing power is positive. Nixon's statement allowed for the rate of inflation to increase, however, so his statement was not as indicative of stable prices as it sounds. ==See also== *Derivative (mathematics) *Second derivative ==References== Category:Differential calculus ","title":"Third derivative"},{"id":"9092742","text":"The Ramacharitam is a Sanskrit epic poem written in Arya metre by Sandhyakar Nandi during Pala Empire, between approximately 1050 and 1150 CE.

In 1991, Forbes magazine named Lawrence among the 400 richest Americans and estimated his fortune at $315 million.; Jack Williams ‚Äì Staff Writer; January 10, 1996 ==Family== Lawrence was born in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to San Diego, California in 1953. He married Geraldine Slesnick in 1949, with whom he had three children. He was in his fourth marriage at the time of his death, to the former Sheila Davis from Brushfork, West Virginia. They had been married since June, 1990. Lawrence has three daughters, a son and six grandchildren. ==Education and early career== Lawrence attended Wilbur Wright College in 1945 and the University of Arizona from 1945 through 1947. A biography entry for Lawrence appeared in Who's Who indicating he had graduated from the University of Arizona in 1947 with a bachelor of arts degree. The University said, however, that Lawrence attended classes there for two years and played varsity football, but left without a degree.Body of Envoy To Be Removed From Arlington, NY Times, December 9, 1997 ==Real estate career== San Diego millionaire John Alessio sold the deteriorating Hotel del Coronado to Lawrence in 1963. Lawrence's initial plan was to develop the land around the hotel and ultimately, to demolish it. Lawrence later changed his mind. During his tenure, Lawrence invested $150 million to refurbish and expand much of the hotel. He doubled its capacity to 700 rooms. He added the Grande Hall Convention Center and two seven-story Ocean Towers just south of the hotel. Lawrence has been known to claim that L. Frank Baum wrote part of The Wizard of Oz at the hotel and that Thomas Edison supervised the wiring of parts of the hotel, neither of which were true. The Lawrence family sold the hotel to the Travelers Group after his death in 1996. ==Politics== Lawrence's first involvement in politics was his work in the 1948 Adlai E. Stevenson II gubernatorial campaign in Illinois. He continued his political activities in California, gaining power and influence in Democratic political circles as a campaign contributor and fund-raiser. He was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from California in 1964, 1968 and 1972. In October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Lawrence to be U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and his intention to appoint Shelia Davis Lawrence to be Special U.S. Representative to the World Conservation Union.White House Press Release; October 25, 1993 He was confirmed as ambassador in March 1994.State Department file - Lawrence; Office of the Historian In 1994, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Lawrence exceeded a $25,000 limit on the amount an individual can give to help finance an election campaign in one year. As a result, he was fined $7,179, the amount of his excess contributions. In a letter to the commission, Lawrence said he was unaware that some of his 1987 contributions counted toward the 1988 total.Ambassador Is Fined for Excess Donations, NY Times, March 8, 1994 ==Death and burial== Lawrence died at age 69 in Bern, Switzerland on January 9, 1996. He had suffered from leukemia and dyscrasia, a blood disorder. Richard Holbrooke, assistant secretary of state, wrote a letter praising Lawrence and requesting burial for him at Arlington National Cemetery. This was granted by Army Secretary Togo D. West, Jr. and the waiver request was approved by the Arlington superintendent. Questions were raised in 1997 about the life of Lawrence, and President Clinton ordered an investigation into whether Lawrence had lied about his military service in World War II. Congressional investigators searched military records and could not corroborate Lawrence's claims of wartime service in the Merchant Marine, or his alleged rank of \\"Seaman, First Class\\" or presence during the torpedoing of the ship SS Horace Bushnell. It was later learned that he was in fact enrolled in college during the time periods that he claimed to have served in the Merchant Marine.

John Edward Kempe. He was educated at St Paul's School, London and then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge where Arthur Cayley was one of his teachers. He graduated BA (22nd wrangler) in 1872. Despite his interest in mathematics he became a barrister, specialising in the ecclesiastical law. He was knighted in 1913, the same year he became the Chancellor for the Diocese of London. He was also Chancellor of the dioceses of Newcastle, Southwell, St Albans, Peterborough, Chichester, and Chelmsford. He received the honorary degree DCL from the University of Durham and he was elected a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1909. In 1876 he published his article On a General Method of describing Plane Curves of the nth degree by Linkwork,A. B. Kempe, (1876) On a General Method of describing Plane Curves of the nth degree by Linkwork. Proceedings of the Royal Society. which showed that for an arbitrary algebraic plane curve a linkage can be constructed that draws the curve. This direct connection between linkages and algebraic curves was recently named the Kempe's universality theoremA. Saxena (2011) Kempe‚Äôs Linkages and the Universality Theorem , RESONANCE that any bounded subset of an algebraic curve may be traced out by the motion of one of the joints in a suitably chosen linkage. Kempe's proof was flawed, and the first complete proof was provided in 2002, based on his ideas.M. Kapovich and J. J.

In 1877 Kempe discovered new straight line linkages and published his influential lectures on the subject.A. B. Kempe (1877) How to draw a straight line; a lecture on linkages, London: Macmillan and Co. In 1879 Kempe wrote his famous \\"proof\\" of the four colour theorem, shown incorrect by Percy Heawood in 1890. Much later, his work led to fundamental concepts such as the Kempe chain and unavoidable sets. Kempe (1886) revealed a rather marked philosophical bent, and much influenced Charles Sanders Peirce. Kempe also discovered what are now called multisets, although this fact was not noted until long after his death.A. B.

Built around an enclosed courtyard, the palazzo is a perfect example of baroque architecture. The canted facades are adorned with twin columns, putti, and statuary, all given extra dramatic effect by the architect's skilful use of chiaroscuro. The ornate Baroque architecture continues into the interior with sculptures by the Palermitano Lombardic Gregorio, and frescoes by Ermenegido Martorana.

The Super Bowl Experience (formerly the NFL Experience) is an annual event which has been held since 1992 at a venue in the host city of the Super Bowl. The event is described as an interactive \\"theme park\\", featuring various fan-oriented attractions, including football-related activities and autograph sessions with current and former players. Proceeds from the sale of Super Bowl Experience tickets go to fund the NFL's Youth Education Town (YET) initiative, which constructs facilities (typically in low-income neighborhoods of Super Bowl host cities) offering afterschool programs for youth. In November 2017, the NFL opened an NFL Experience attraction at New York City's 20 Times Square, in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil, which featured a similar array of interactive experiences and memorabilia. Consequently, the NFL began to refer to the travelling event as the Super Bowl Experience beginning in 2018 for Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. The Times Square experience was later closed. ==History== The first NFL Experience was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center in January 1992 prior to Super Bowl XXVI. The NFL's interactive theme park was followed by Major League Baseball's first \\"FanFest\\" in San Diego, California six months later. In 2013 the NFL Experience was hosted at the New Orleans Morial Convention Center. The NFL Experience was not held for Super Bowl XLVIII. Instead, the NFL organized an outdoor festival, Super Bowl Boulevard, along Broadway and Times Square, which featured a similar array of fan-oriented events and attractions (such as an artificial toboggan hill). Animal Planet held a \\"Puppy Bowl Experience\\" at the Discovery Times Square exhibition promoting its annual Puppy Bowl special (which traditionally airs on the day of the Super Bowl), to ride the festivities' coattails. The 2015 NFL Experience was hosted at the Phoenix Convention Center. The 2016 NFL Experience was hosted at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The 2017 NFL Experience was hosted at George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. The Houston Super Bowl Host Committee also hosted its own outdoor festival, Super Bowl Live, in the adjacent Discovery Green park, which featured entertainment events. For Super Bowl LII, the event was renamed the Super Bowl Experience, and was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center. The Super Bowl LIII edition was held at the Georgia World Congress Center. The Super Bowl Experience for Super Bowl LIV was held at the Miami Beach Convention Center. == NFL Experience Times Square == On November 30, 2017, the NFL opened an attraction known as NFL Experience Times Square, within four ground-level floors of 20 Times Square in New York City. The 40,000 square- foot attraction was a collaboration with Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group, and featured various interactive activities and multimedia experiences, including a 4D film, a simulated locker room and practice area, displays of memorabilia, and a bar and restaurant that would feature a rotation of menu selections from NFL stadiums. In February 2018, it was announced that NFL Network's Good Morning Football would move to a studio at the attraction in April, after having previously used a CBS studio in New York City. In September 2018, it was announced that the attraction would close, citing underperforming attendance numbers (which analysts pegged to poor promotion by the NFL, and high ticket prices). It was to remain open through at least the end of 2018. Good Morning Football moved to SportsNet New York's facilities at 4 World Trade Center in November 2018. ==See also== *Hoop City ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:National Football League Category:Super Bowl culture Category:Entertainment events in the United States ","title":"Super Bowl Experience"},{"id":"9092948","text":" The Interstate Cadet was an American two-seat tandem, high wing, single- engine monoplane light aircraft. Around 320 of these aircraft were produced between the years 1941 and 1942 by the Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation based in El Segundo, California. The construction techniques employed were a welded steel tube fuselage, wood (spruce) wing structure with metal ribs, and fabric covering, all of which were fairly standard in the 1940s. An Interstate Cadet, flown by aviator Cornelia Fort and an unknown student, was one of the first aircraft (if not the first) to be attacked by IJNAS Japanese naval planes en route to the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941. ==Design and development== The original version, the S1 prototype, was powered by the 50 hp Continental A50 engine, but was soon upgraded to the Continental A65 engine and redesignated as the S1-A-65F. This was a common engine used in many small American two-seat aircraft of the time. This aircraft would be used during World War Two under the L-6A designation. In 1945 the rights to the aircraft were sold to Harlow Aircraft Company, which in turn resold the tooling and parts to the Call Aircraft Company of Afton, Wyoming in 1946 for $5,000 ($ in ). Callair rebuilt a number of S-1, S-1A and L-6s, some with engine upgrades, for local ranchers and bush pilots as well as two examples of their own serial numbered CallAir S-1A-90C before stopping production, focusing instead on variations of its original CallAir Model A (which also sold in small numbers, fewer than 200 total units)., {Anelon interviews with former Callair employees} One reason the Cadet may not have sold well was that this aircraft cost almost three times the amount of the comparable Piper J-3 Cub. However, a close look at the two aircraft reveals that the Cadet was faster, stronger, and could be operated in a more rugged environment with its Oleo strut/Compression spring suspension system. Popular upgrades for this airframe included larger engines(75/85/90/100 hp), better brakes, and a different tailwheel system. In the late 1960s the type certificates and tooling were bought by the newly formed Arctic Aircraft Company who transformed the S-1B1 into a bush plane by upgrading structural elements of the fuselage, landing gear and wings. This aircraft was designated the S-1B2, was used a Lycoming O-320 160 HP engine and a McCauley propeller for increased performance and was certified in 1975 as the Arctic Tern. The new Type certification also covered installing the same engine in otherwise standard Interstate Cadets. ==Variants== A later S-1B2 Arctic Tern Interstate Cadet S-1A ;S-1 :Certified in 1940 and powered by a Continental A50-8 engine. ;S-1A :Certified in 1941 and powered by a Continental A65-8 engine.

The supporting cast includes George Raft and Hedda Hopper (before she became a noted gossip columnist). The movie was directed by Hobart Henley and features an early Busby Berkeley music number, \\"Who's Your Little Who-Zis\\".Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 26 Although Karloff is a villain, he plays a charming man, quite unlike most of the parts he was allowed to play at the time. ==Plot== On a cold winter's night outside Happy's Nightclub, Irish-American police officer Ryan (Robert Emmett O'Connor) chats with African-American doorman Tim Washington (Clarence Muse), who is worried about his critically ill wife. Inside, club owner Happy (Boris Karloff) is arguing with his shrewish but glamorous wife Jill (Dorothy Revier) and welcoming frequent customers Ed Powell (George Raft), a crooked gambler, and Michael Rand (Lew Ayres). Rand is a wealthy college boy who watched his mother kill his father after catching him with another woman, a case widely covered by the tabloids. Rand is now drinking heavily to deaden his pain. Backstage, gambler Powell asks chorus girl Ruth Taylor (Mae Clarke) for a date and, after losing an impromptu bet, she agrees to go out with him. After the floor show, all the chorus girls are asked to stay late by their cruel dance master, Klauss (Russell Hopton), who is secretly having an affair with Happy's wife Jill. Edith Blair (Dorothy Petersen) spots a drunken Michael Rand sitting alone at a table. Edith was the 'other woman' in the murder of Michael's father. She tells Michael that she and his father were only good friends, and that his father loved him deeply. She also tells Michael that his killer mother never loved his father, and cursed him as he was dying. An upset Michael creates an outburst and overturns a table at the nightclub. He passes out after being punched, and is taken to the back room of the club where Ruth cares for him. Happy leaves to discuss bootleg liquor purchases with another gangster, Jim. (Huntley Gordon.) As he exits, doorman Tim asks if he can leave early to visit is ailing wife, but Happy refuses. When Michael wakes up from his liquor-related nap, he and Ruth have a warm chat. Gambler Powell interrupts them and insists Ruth come to his apartment immediately. Michael punches Powell and Tim takes the fallen gambler out to a taxi. Suddenly, Michael's mother (Hedda Hopper) arrives at the nightclub. Michael confronts her about the way she treated his father. The late-night dance rehearsal continues, but Klauss calls a break so he can spend more time with Jill. Happy returns, and Tim asks again if he can go see his wife in the hospital. Happy refuses. Happy catches Jill and Klauss together, and Klauss leaves in disgrace. Happy tells Jill that he will not divorce her, but remain married to her and do his best to make her miserable. Michael and Ruth sit down for a meal together. Michael asks Ruth if she would be interested in running away to Bali with him, as his wife, even though they have only known each other for a few hours. Their happy moment is interrupted by Tim, who has just learned that his wife is dead. As he leaves the club to finally go to her bedside, he is fatally shot by gangster Jim and a comrade, who have come for Happy. They shoot Happy and then his wife Jill. When they turn their guns towards Michael and Ruth, they are suddenly shot dead by the returning police officer Ryan. Michael and Ruth get into the police wagon together, and Ruth agrees to go Bali with Michael. ==Cast== * Lew Ayres as Michael Rand * Mae Clarke as Ruth Taylor * Boris Karloff as \\"Happy\\" MacDonald * Dorothy Revier as Jill MacDonald * Hedda Hopper as Mrs. Rand * George Raft as Ed Powell * Russell Hopton as Klauss * Clarence Muse as Tim Washington, the doorman * Dorothy Peterson as Edith Blair * Bert Roach as Tommy * Gene Morgan as Joe * Huntley Gordon as Jim * Robert Emmett O'Connor as Police Officer Ryan * Arletta Duncan as Cigarette Girl * Alice Adair as Chorine (uncredited) * Louise Beavers as Maid (uncredited) * Billy Bletcher as Nightclub Patron (uncredited) * Sammy Blum as Salesman (uncredited) * Edna Callahan as Chorus Girl (uncredited) * Helene Chadwick as Nightclub Patron (uncredited) * Andr√© Cheron as Frenchman from Schenectady (uncredited) * Frankie Farr as Trick Waiter (uncredited) * Byron Foulger as Mr. Baby / Nightclub Patron (uncredited) * Greta Granstedt as Blonde (uncredited) * Hal Grayson as Orchestra Leader (uncredited) * Harriet Hagman as Chorine (uncredited) * Mary Halsey as Chorus Girl (uncredited) * Amo Ingraham as Chorine (uncredited) * Jack La Rue as Henchman (uncredited) * Florence Lake as Ms. Smith (uncredited) * Robert Livingston as Nightclub Patron (uncredited) * Geneva Mitchell as Florabelle (uncredited) * Paisley Noon as Clarence (uncredited) * Eddie Phillips as Vaudevillian (uncredited) * Pat Somerset as Guest (uncredited) * Larry Steers as Nightclub Patron (uncredited) * Tom Tamarez as Gigolo (uncredited) * Ray Turner as Washroom Attendant (uncredited) * Harry Woods as Gang Leader (uncredited) ==Production== The film's working title was Night Club.Night World at TCMDB This film is preserved in the Library of Congress collection.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress, (<-book title) p.127 c.1978 by The American Film Institute Raft had appeared in Scarface but that film had not yet been released when he was cast in this. ==Reception== The New York Times said \\"the film is a symphonic arrangement of songs and snatches of human experience.

The album was Wilson's first solo album to be released since her debut album, Mary Wilson, in 1979 on Motown Records. Wilson had begun work on a second solo album in 1980, working with English record producer, Gus Dudgeon. Dudgeon had produced 4 tracks for the album but Motown dropped Wilson from the label before the album was completed. After leaving Motown, Wilson almost signed with Atlantic Records in 1987 but the label cancelled on the deal. In 1990, Wilson signed with Nightmare Records (which later turned into Motorcity Records). Wilson recorded and released her cover version of the Five Stairsteps's classic hit \\"Ooh Child\\" on the Motorcity label but never recorded a full album for the label. A year later, Wilson signed with CEO Records and released Walk the Line in 1992. A day after Walk the Line was released, CEO went into bankruptcy. Wilson later claimed that she had no knowledge of the label's financial troubles and stated that she was coerced into signing with them for the release. Because of the bankruptcy issue with the label, Walk the Line fell out of place on the Billboard charts despite Wilson's promotion efforts. It features covers of \\"Ooh Child\\" and Jennifer Holliday's song \\"I Am Changing\\" from the original Dreamgirls broadway play. During the recording sessions, Wilson recorded an updated version of The Supremes' #1 single \\"Love Child\\", complete with vocal rap (the background track was the same one as used by Sweet Sensation on their 1990 cover of the song).

She earned her humanities BA from The University of Pennsylvania, MA from Harvard University and her MFA in Photography from Yale School of Art in 1999., ==Career== Grannan's work has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, and is in public collections, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R.

She has also recently taken a portrait of President Barack Obama for The New York Times. Her preference to photograph strangers began while she was still at Yale School of Art, when she placed newspaper advertisements asking for \\"people for portraits\\". In her \\"Dream America\\" series, volunteers sometimes posed nude and often chose to pose in vacant lots or rooms with low ceilings. Writing in The New Yorker Andrea Scott called the portraits \\"an alloy of vulnerability, bravado, and nerves,\\" and a view of the American dream turned inside out. In other work, Grannan photographed people in their homes and focused on the way their environments‚Äîfurniture or aspects of private life‚Äîilluminated people's character. This work culminated in the monograph The Model American. For her series Boulevard, Grannan was influenced by her new surroundings in California. She would photograph strangers in Los Angeles and San Francisco against stark white walls as a backdrop. Each photograph is the result of an on-the-spot collaboration, made with the willing participation of her subjects, who she compensates for their time. She befriended several of the subjects and made a video piece called \\"The Believers\\" with them http://vimeo.com/22914861 Speaking of her Modesto photography, Grannan said that she was inspired by a childhood best friend who lived in the streets as a teenager and died in her 20s; Grannan spoke of her photographs not so much as activism but as a mutual flow of connections and generosity. Grannan is influenced by the work of photographers such as Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin. Sean O'Hagan, reviewing her 2009 London exhibition The Westerns, described her work as \\"never less than intriguing\\" with \\"an otherworldliness here that sets her apart from her influences.\\" ==Film== Shot over three years on South Ninth Street or \\"The Nine\\", the film is a feature-length portrait of a small community of outliers living on a blighted street in a marginalized part of California. ==Personal== Grannan grew up in Arlington, Massachusetts.

Christian tradition states that he was a wealthy Roman army officer who was the first martyr in Melitene, Armenia, under Valerian. Symeon Metaphrastes writes that, moved by the zeal of his friend Saint Nearchus, Polyeuctus had openly converted to Christianity. \\"Enflamed with zeal, St Polyeuctus went to the city square, and tore up the edict of Decius which required everyone to worship idols. A few moments later, he met a procession carrying twelve idols through the streets of the city. He dashed the idols to the ground and trampled them underfoot.\\" He was tortured by the authorities and ignored the tears and protestations of his wife Paulina, his children, and his father-in-law. He was beheaded. ==Veneration== Painting depicting the martyrdom of Polyeuctus, from the Menologion of Basil II (c. 1000 AD) He was buried at Melitene, and a church was dedicated to him there. Christian tradition states that the parents of Euthymius the Great prayed for a son at the church of St. Polyeuctus in Melitene. A church was dedicated to him at Constantinople by Anicia Juliana in 524-527. The excavations undertaken in the 1960s revealed that, at the time of Justinian's ascension to the throne, the basilica was the largest in Constantinople and that it featured some remarkably ostentatious display of wealth, such as gilded reliefs of peacocks, as well as much oriental detail. His feast day was January 7 in the ancient Armenian calendars. His feast day is now January 7 in the Catholic calendar. In the Eastern Orthodox liturgics, his feast falls on January 9. Polyektus is the patron saint of vows and treaty agreements. ==Cultural references== Pierre Corneille, inspired by the account of Polyeuctus' martyrdom, used elements from the saint's story in his tragedy Polyeucte (1642). In 1878 it was adapted into an opera by Charles Gounod, with the assistance of the librettist Jules Barbier. Other works based on the play include a ballet by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1679), and the opera Poliuto (1838) by Donizetti (adapted with Scribe as Les martyrs). Paul Dukas composed his Polyeucte overture, which premiered in January 1892. ==References== ==External links== *Saint of the Day, February 13: Saint Polyeuctus *Catholic Online: Saint Polyeuctus *Martyr Polyeuctus of Melitene, in Armenia *Santiebeati: Saint Polyeuctus Category:Saints from Roman Anatolia Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions Category:259 deaths Category:3rd-century Christian martyrs Category:Christian martyrs executed by decapitation Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures Category:Military saints ","title":"Polyeuctus"},{"id":"9093082","text":"The Illinois Veteran Grant (IVG) is a program whereby the state of Illinois provides educational benefits to certain Illinoisans who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States.

The first siege lasted from late February to late May 1644, when the siege was lifted. The second siege took place a year later from July to December 1645. Lathom House was captured and slighted. ==Background== James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, was the leading Royalist adherent in the northwest of England when the civil war broke out in 1642. The family seat of the Stanleys was Lathom House. In 1643, the Earl of Derby was ordered by King Charles to fortify the Isle of Man against a possible Scottish invasion, and then move on to the northern campaign. His wife, Charlotte de la Tremo√ºille, was left in charge of what turned out to be the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Lancashire. Sir Thomas Fairfax saw Derby's absence as an opportunity to strengthen the Long Parliament's position in Lancashire and set out to conquer Lathom House. Immediately after the fall of Warrington, the Parliamentarians requested that the countess acknowledge Parliament's authority and surrender her house, but she refused on the grounds that doing so would dishonour her husband. She offered to limit herself to defending her home, and this postponed further attacks on her position. ==First siege== When Fairfax arrived at Lathom House in February 1644, the Countess had made every effort to conceal the strength of the castle's fortifications. Fairfax demanded that the Countess surrender Lathom House to him. She asked for a week to consider his offer, and then insisted that it was only appropriate that he visit her at Lathom House for further negotiations. He was received as an honoured guest, but the entire household categorically rejected his terms for surrendering. He gave her two more days to consider her situation. The emissary sent two days later was scornfully dismissed. The siege began with 2,000 Parliamentary soldiers (500 cavalry and 1,500 infantry) against a garrison of 300. The fortifications of Lathom House consisted of: * Outer walls and embankments six feet thick * An eight-yard moat * Nine towers, each with six cannons, three pointing in either direction, and the Eagle Tower providing an excellent overview of the battlefield In addition, the castle was at the lowest point in the middle of an open expanse that allowed superb views of the enemy's activities. Charlotte had assembled a militia of seasoned marksmen who were able to inflict significant losses by sniping. John Seacome, an 18th-century historian of the House of Stanley quoted from another account A true and genuine account of the famous and ever memorable siege of Lathom- House in the County of Lancaster: Cromwell's Stone. The hollows in the stone are said to have been used for casting shot by Cromwell's army in the siege of Lathom House. The fortifications sustained continuous cannon and mortar fire with minimal damage. The Royalists launched several successful sorties to disrupt Parliamentary efforts to set up batteries. As a result, Parliamentary forces were unable to establish any major artillery positions against the castle, and the army refused to replenish those guns that were lost or spiked during the sorties. Morale among the Roundheads also suffered greatly as the besieged shot soldiers and engineers on the battlefield. Nevertheless, Fairfax persisted in demanding that Charlotte surrender to his forces, going so far as to obtain a letter from Lord Stanley asking for safe passage for her. She refused to surrender under any terms, rebuking messengers in increasingly disdainful tones. After one particularly audacious sortie in late April that destroyed several Roundhead positions, Fairfax declared a day of fasting and prayer in his camp. One of the chaplains invoked the following verse from Jeremiah 50:14: Captain Hector Schofield, a messenger from Colonel Alexander Rigby of the Roundheads, arrived to offer Charlotte an honourable surrender. She threatened to hang him from the tower gates, then asked him to convey the following while she tore the message: A similar ultimatum issued by Rigby on 23 May prompted Charlotte to respond: \\"The mercies of the wicked are cruel .... unless they treated with her lord, they should never take her or any of her friends alive\\". The siege was lifted on the night of 27 May as the Royalist general Prince Rupert approached Lathom with thousands of cavalry and infantry. Charlotte and her household departed for the Isle of Man, leaving the care of Lathom House to Colonel Edward Rawstorne. ==Second siege== After the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Marston Moor, which was fought 2 July 1644, the north of England was largely under Parliamentary control apart from areas close to Royalist garrisons such as Lathom House. The next year (1645), in July, 4,000 Parliamentary troops returned to begin the second siege. Their commander Colonel Peter Egerton made Ormskirk his headquarters while his men encamped on Aughton Moss (or Aughton Moor), near Aughton Mill. Trenchfield House, on the site of this encampment, still retains the name. The garrison did not capitulate quickly, but when it became clear that no relief could be expected, and supplies were running short, famine forced Colonel Rawstorne's hand and he surrendered at discretion to Colonel Egerton on 2 December 1645. ==Aftermath== The fall of Lathom House was regarded as an event of the first importance by the Parliamentary party. Besides the material gain of twelve pieces of cannon and a large store of arms and ammunition, the Republicans had achieved a great moral triumph in the fall of the famous royalist house, and an order was issued by the House of Commons \\"for the ministers about London to give public thanks to God, on the next Lord's Day, for its surrender\\". After the Restoration the property was regained by the Derby family, and in the early part of the eighteenth century it was still occasionally inhabited by them, but Knowsley Hall succeeded Lathom House as the principal seat of the Stanley family. ==In Literature== * Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem 'Lord and Lady Derby' and the notes attached reflect on Lady Derby's fortitude during the siege. ==Popular culture== *The song \\"They called her Babylon\\" by Steeleye Span tells the story of the siege. It appears on their 2004 album of the same name. ==Citations== ==References== :: :: :: :: :: :: ==General References== :: :: :: ==External links== :: Category:Sieges of the English Civil Wars Category:Battles involving Lancashire Category:1644 in England Category:Conflicts in 1644 Category:17th century in Lancashire Category:Borough of West Lancashire ","title":"Siege of Lathom House"},{"id":"9093124","text":"A≈°≈°≈´r-bƒìl-nƒ´≈°ƒì≈°u, inscribed mda≈°-≈°ur-EN-UN.ME≈†--≈°√∫,Nassouhi King List, Istanbul A. 116 (Assur 8836), iii 11‚Äì12.Khorsabad King List, IM 60017 (excavation nos.: DS 828, DS 32-54), iii 5‚Äì6.SDAS King List, tablet IM 60484, ii 38. and meaning ‚Äú(the god) A≈°≈°ur (is) lord of his people,‚Äù was the ruler of Assyria from 1417‚Äì1409 BC or 1407‚Äì1398 BC (short chronology), the variants due to uncertainties in the later chronology.

This includes things like Scene, Take and Notes information. It is the result of extended discussions between the various manufacturers of Field recorders, and editing systems. It is designed to standardise the exchange of metadata between these systems. The iXML specification describes an WAV RIFF chunk in BWF files which contains standard XML data following the iXML specification. It also introduces the concept of using iXML in IP video streams such as NDI Prior to the development of the iXML specification, the film and TV industry relied on the BWF bext description chunk which was used differently by many vendors to roughly encode some small metadata, but was invariably undefined, with too little space for full information. Whilst many systems tried to read what they could from the bext data, because of no specification and limited space, bext usefulness was limited. ==History== The iXML concept was born during a meeting of various vendors, including manufacturers of field recorders, NLEs and DAWs, hosted by the Institute of Broadcast Sound, in London, on 8 July 2004. The \\"i\\" in iXML recognises the part the IBS played in bringing together such a diverse blend of normally competitive manufacturers to collectively solve the increasingly difficult problem of metadata interchange, with an elegant, capable and completely public specification. Following initial discussions between Mark Gilbert of Gallery, John Ellwood of SynchroArts and J.P Beauviala of Aaton at the IBS meeting, the iXML 1.0 Specification was developed, drawn up and published by Mark Gilbert of Gallery UK at http://www.ixml.info. The iXML Specification is maintained by Gallery UK, and changes made are based on discussions by the iXML committee. Soon after the IBS meeting, Gallery shipped Metacorder which was the first iXML compatible device. Mark Gilbert continued to promote the iXML format all over the world during 2004 and 2005 and gradually products emerged from other vendors. Other early adopters of iXML included SynchroArt's TITAN utility, and HHB's Portadrive field recorder. In 2019 Gallery introduced the notion of using iXML in NDI based video/audio streams and the iXML 3.0 specification was announced which will define this. ==In Use== Today, dozens of industry standard audio products support iXML with 100% interchange of metadata between systems. This includes all the current location field recorders (for which the spec was originally designed), several DAW applications (including Digidesign Pro Tools, Sony Vegas, Cockos Reaper and Steinberg Cubase/Nuendo) and various utilities. In late 2007, Apple Inc. added iXML support to their Final Cut Pro non linear video editor, which is used by more than 800,000 users worldwide. iXML support was introduced with version 6.02 of Final Cut Pro. ==External links== *iXML Specification *Metacorder iXML recorder *Wave Agent - Broadcast Wave File (iXML & BEXT) viewer/player/editor Category:Digital audio recording ","title":"IXML"},{"id":"9093203","text":"Forcella Staulanza (el. 1773 m.) is a high mountain pass in the Dolomites in the province of Belluno in Italy.

DICE was created by Clay Dreslough in 2001. The formula for Defense-Independent Component ERA (DICE) is: : \\\\text{DICE} =3.00 + \\\\frac {13HR + 3(BB + HBP) - 2K}{IP} In that equation, \\"HR\\" is home runs, \\"BB\\" is walks, \\"HBP\\" is hit batters, \\"K\\" is strikeouts, and \\"IP\\" is innings pitched. That equation gives a number that is better at predicting a pitcher's ERA in the following year than the pitcher's actual ERA in the current year. Component ERA was created by Bill James to create a more accurate way of evaluating pitchers than earned run average (ERA). Whereas ERA is significantly affected by luck (such as whether the component hits are allowed consecutively), Component ERA eliminates this factor and assigns a weight to each of the recorded 'components' of a pitchers performance. For CERA, these are singles, doubles, triples, home runs, walks and hit batters. DICE is an improvement on CERA that removes the contribution of the pitcher's defense, instead estimate a pitcher's ERA from the components of his pitching record that don't involve defense. These are home runs, walks, hit batters and strikeouts. ==References== Category:Pitching statistics ","title":"Defense-Independent Component ERA"},{"id":"9093235","text":"Chun Hee-chul (Hangul: Ï†ÑÌù¨Ï≤†; born June 26, 1973 in Seoul) is a retired South Korean basketball player.

Products are used for air, sea, ground, missile and space applications. Over 150,000 aircraft have been equipped with Astronautics equipment. Astronautics products electronic flight instrument systems, electronic flight bags, engine indicating and crew alerting systems, network server systems, multifunction displays, mission and display processors and systems, flight directors, flight control systems, inertial guidance systems, air data computers, and autopilots. ==History== In June 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, brother and sister Nate Zelazo and Norma Paige started the Astronautics Corporation of America as an advanced technology aerospace company. Zelazo had been employed by the Navy Department, and the company's small staff had an extensive background in designing and developing flight instrumentation. The company began to seek business with the military, initially working with local universities, and obtained a program from the US Air Force investigating fuel management techniques for space vehicle orbital rendezvous. It later sought further involvement in Navy, Army and Air Force flight instrumentation production programs. Nate Zelazo, founder, in front of one of his earlier projects In the latter half of the 1960s, Astronautics received backing from the American City Bank and Trust Company, which became bankrupt in the 1973-75 recession; Zelazo hired its former CEO, Pete Erickson, as Astronautics' CFO in 1976. Erickson worked for the company for the thirteen years until his retirement, investing in the stock and bond market and arranging the purchase of a corporate building on Teutonia Avenue in the city's west side in 1982. He also handled the financial side of the purchase of Astronautics' subsidiary, Kearfott Corporation, in 1988 from Singer Corporation. After participating in several production programs for aircraft flight instruments for the military, Astronautics developed a design and production capability, and began supplying flight instrumentation for aircraft such as the B-52, F-4, A-4, C-130, UH-1, P-3 and many others. This capability was soon expanded to provide the complete flight director systems, which included the flight director computer, for several military aircraft. As military flight instrumentation advanced, Astronautics began competing for the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) technology that was being applied to aircraft instrumentation. The company entered into a contract to provide the Horizontal Situation Display (HSD) for the Air Force F-111 Aircraft. This display program, which combined CRT and optical technologies, resulted in further expansion of Astronautics Engineering, Quality, Reliability, Production and Contract Administration Departments. Astronautics then also developed the Head Up Display for both the A-10 Aircraft and the Shuttle trainer aircraft. Astronautics then supplied medical monitors for CAT scanners and also supplied displays to NASA for the mission control center in Houston, Texas. Astronautics became an avionics supplier to the Italian, German and British governments for their high-performance aircraft. Astronautics then made developments in flat panel displays and digital avionics. The company supplied both military and civilian aircraft with avionics and airborne servers. after acquiring Kearfott Guidance & Navigation Corporation in 1988, Astronautics provided inertial navigation systems for space and maritime use. Astronautics produced a low-end supercomputer, the ZS-1, designed by James Smith of the University of Wisconsin; one was manufactured, but the model did not sell, and is exhibited at the Rhode Island Computer Museum. An RICM member believes about 20 machines were made, most sold to NASA, however, this needs verification as this is currently lacking citation.

He also won two top division tournament championships. After his retirement in 1979 he became a coach under the name of Hanaregoma-oyakata and established Hanaregoma stable. He was also chairman of the Japan Sumo Association from 2010 to 2012. ==Career== While at Nihon University he practiced judo. He made his professional sumo debut in September 1966 at the age of 18, fighting out of Hanakago stable. Initially fighting under his own surname of Nishimori, he reached the second j≈´ry≈ç division in January 1970. He adopted the shikona of Hananishiki before switching to Kaiketsu in November 1970. He reached the top makuuchi division in September 1971. In March 1972 from the maegashira 7 ranking he was the tournament runner-up to Hasegawa, who defeated him in a playoff, and he was given special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. At the following tournament in May 1972 he made his san'yaku debut at komusubi rank. After scoring 11 wins there and finishing as runner-up to his stablemate Wajima he was promoted to sekiwake. He was also a runner-up in January 1973. In September 1974 Kaiketsu turned in a make-koshi or losing score of 7‚Äì8 at sekiwake rank but then took his first top division y≈´sh≈ç or championship in November as a komusubi. He scored twelve wins against three losses, and defeated yokozuna Kitanoumi in a playoff. He followed this up with an 11‚Äì4 score in January 1975. His combined total of wins over the last three tournaments was 30, below the normal standard for ≈çzeki promotion of 33, but there was only one ≈çzeki at the time, Takanohana, so the Sumo Association decided to promote Kaiketsu. After suffering from hepatitis and lower back pain, Kaiketsu was demoted from ≈çzeki less than a year after reaching the rank following two consecutive losing scores. However, in September 1976 ranked at maegashira 4, he took his second tournament championship with a 14‚Äì1 record, followed by consecutive 11‚Äì4 scores at sekiwake in November 1976 and January 1977. He was promoted to ≈çzeki once again, alongside Wakamisugi, to whom he had a superior three tournament record. However, he held the rank for only four more tournaments, and soon fell back to the maegashira ranks. He retired in January 1979, having not missed a single bout in his 12-year career. He once said, \\"Being absent from a tournament means deliberately abandoning a bout.\\" In addition to his two y≈´sh≈ç he had accumulated ten special prizes (including seven for Fighting Spirit) and three kinboshi. ==After retirement== Kaiketsu set up his own training stable, Hanaregoma stable, in 1981 after breaking away from Hanakago. Joining him was future yokozuna ≈ånokuni. In 1985, when Hanakago stable was wound up, all its wrestlers transferred to Hanaregoma. Other top division wrestlers he trained included Hananokuni, Hananoumi and Shunketsu. He also became a Director of the Japan Sumo Association, responsible for managing the judges, and supervising the examination of new recruits. In August 2010 he took over as head of the Association after the resignation of Musashigawa. Following a match-fixing scandal which broke in February 2011 he announced an independent investigation and the cancellation of the March 2011 Osaka honbasho. He insisted that there was no match-fixing in the past, a claim that drew criticism from sumo commentator and former wrestler Mainoumi. He stood down from the post at the February 2012 Sumo Association board elections as the terms are for two years and he was close to the mandatory retirement age of 65. He left the Sumo Association in February 2013 and Hanaregoma stable was absorbed into Shibatayama stable, run by ex‚Äì≈ånokuni. He died on May 18, 2014 while practicing golf. He was 66. ==Fighting style== Kaiketsu's favourite kimarite or techniques were tsuppari (a series of rapid thrusts to the chest), hidari yotsu (a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on the mawashi), yori kiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw). ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of ≈çzeki ==References== Category:1948 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Yamaguchi Prefecture Category:≈åzeki Category:Nihon University alumni ","title":"Kaiketsu Masateru"},{"id":"9093332","text":"Paul van der Feen (born 8 June 1978, in Middelburg), is a Dutch saxophonist. == Career == Being from a musical family, Paul not unexpectedly displayed an extraordinary love for music from a young age.

He then attended the County School at Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire at the same time as Clement Davies, later Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire for the Liberal Party for many years. From there Richards went on to study at University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read the Economics Tripos and received an upper second-class degree in 1908.Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees, Who's Who of British Members of Parliament: Volume IV, 1945-1979 (London: Harvester Press, 1981), p. 312.'University Intelligence', Times, 15 June 1908.

He was Attorney-General in the Molteno Government, Chief Justice for the Cape Colony, and later the first Chief Justice for the Union of South Africa. ==Early life and legal career== John de Villiers was the son of Charles Christian de Villiers, of Paarl, Cape of Good Hope, and his wife Dorothea Retief. His family was of French Huguenot descent and had arrived in the Cape four generations before in 1689. His father's dying wish had been that he become a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church, however after 18 months study he found that he had no true calling to the church, and switched to studying law. He studied in Berlin and London (where he read law at the Inner Temple), was called to the English bar in 1865 and the Cape bar the next year. William Porter, the Attorney General at the time, became his legal mentor and soon afterwards he entered parliament representing Worcester. In parliament, he and Porter supported John Molteno's movement for responsible government in 1872, even helping to draft the bill that secured it. ==Attorney-General of the Cape Colony (1872‚Äì1874)== In November 1872, after the Cape successfully attained self-government, the country's unpopular Attorney General William Griffith was retired. John de Villiers was called upon to replace him as Attorney-General of the Cape Colony in Molteno's cabinet. He served for only two years, from 1872 to 1874. He was thus the first Attorney-General of the Cape under responsible government. At the time it was still legal to have a private practice, and de Villiers did so. However this work in addition to his work as legal adviser to the government and drafting parliamentary bills put severe strain on his health. ==Chief Justice (1874‚Äì1914)== Statue of John Henry de Villiers as Chief Justice In 1874, on Molteno's insistence, he agreed to take the office of Chief Justice of the Cape Colony - a job he performed with great dedication and skill until the act of Union in 1910. After the Union of South Africa was created, he went on to serve as Chief Justice of South Africa from 1910 to 1914. Altogether, he served as Chief Justice for 40 years, with \\"...an ever-growing reputation of the highest character for independence, legal ability, and irreproachable impartiality.\\"P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1900. p.201. Although he had represented Worcester in Parliament and was very much interested in politics, John de Villiers chose not to pursue political power any further. His reserved and sensitive personality, together with a weak physical constitution and his lack of outward charisma, made him ill-suited to the rough world of politics. However his academic ability, progressive thinking, huge range of intellectual interests and driving work ethic served to make him peerless in the judiciary. ==Titles and later life== In 1877 he was knighted, and in 1882 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). He was admitted to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1897, and in 1910 he was raised to the peerage as Baron de Villiers, of Wynberg in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and the Union of South Africa. He was South African Freemason. Lord de Villiers married Aletta Johanna, daughter of Jan Pieter Jordaan, in 1871. He died in September 1914, aged 72, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Charles Percy de Villiers. Lady de Villiers died in 1922. ==Notes== ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

Cafasso claimed to have been a retired Special Forces lieutenant colonel who was a Vietnam War veteran and recipient of the Silver Star, but his official service records showed he had been administratively separated in 1976 during basic training after 44 days. ==Early life== Born in 1956 to Joseph A.

Some time thereafter, members of the group began questioning Cafasso's military background, and, according to Donaldson, Cafasso would not produce his official record when requested to do so. As a result, Donaldson disassociated his organization from Cafasso. ==Political activities== Prior to his employment with Fox News, Cafasso had worked for the Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign, fundraising and running petition drives. Official campaign finance records show that Cafasso was being reimbursed by the Buchanan campaign committee for travel and other expenses. He also became involved with a humanitarian organization led by Serbian-American activist David Vuich that was seeking to help people in Yugoslavia in the aftermath of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign. ==Departure from Fox News== Cafasso had claimed to have been a retired lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces, a veteran of the Vietnam War, a recipient of the Silver Star, and a participant in Operation Eagle Claw. However, his official military record indicated that he served only 44 days in the U.S. Army from May to June 1976, being administratively separated from the service. Around the time the New York Times was developing a story about Cafasso he sent the newspaper an email claiming that his leaving Fox News was tantamount to \\"political assassination by a group of self-centered individuals with their own political agendas.\\" Cafasso appeared briefly in Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism, the 2004 documentary film that made the argument that Fox News had a right-wing bias. In it he delivers a short comment on decision-making at the network, comparing it to what he calls the \\"Christian fundamentalist movement\\".

On August 11, 2014, it merged with the United Transportation Union (UTU) to form the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, known by the acronym, SMART. The Sheet Metal Workers' International Association represented about 150,000 members in 185 local unions in the United States and Canada. ==History== In 1887, Robert Kellerstrass, secretary of the Tin and Cornice Makers Association of Peoria, Illinois‚Äîa local sheet metal workers' union‚Äîbegan agitating for the formation of a national sheet metal workers' union. Contacting as many tinsmiths' locals as he could, Kellerstrass arranged for a founding convention to be held in January 1888. Eleven delegates from Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Tennessee met for four days. The union was founded on January 25, 1888 in Toledo, Ohio, as the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers' International Association.Mercey, The Sheet Metal Workers' Story, 1980. In five years the organization grew to include 108 locals in the United States. The first local in Canada was chartered in 1896 as well, in Toronto. A second Canadian local formed in Montreal in 1900, and a Vancouver local in 1902. The union joined the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1889. The Panic of 1893 weakened the union significantly, however, and the union's finances collapsed. The AFL revoked the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers' charter in 1896, even though many locals continued to exist. The union reorganized in 1897 as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, and was rechartered by the AFL in 1899. In 1902, the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' union instituted its first national death benefit for its members. In 1903, the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' merged with the Sheet Metal Workers' National Alliance, a secessionist group that had broken away from the union in 1902, creating the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance. In 1907, the union merged with the Coppersmiths' International Union. The union became embroiled in a bruising battle with the plumbers' and carpenters' unions in 1919. The Sheet Metal Workers had organized thousands of railway locomotive fabricators nationwide, but now the plumbers' union was arguing that it had jurisdiction over the piping work that went into building these engines. Railroad shop workers from the machinists, blacksmiths and plumbers met in St. Louis, Missouri in 1920 after a number of local plumbers' railroad unions defected to the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. Although the workers could not agree on which union should have jurisdiction over the work, the workers did agree to form the Federated Railroad Shopmen's Union to protect their work from being taken over by non-railroad workers. In 1921, the federated union disbanded, but the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers won substantial jurisdictional concessions from the plumbers. The conflict would continue into the 1950s, substantially weakening the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. Finally, on April 26, 1955, the National Mediation Board reaffirmed Amalgamated Sheet Metal Worker jurisdiction over plumbing and pipefitting work in the railroad industry. The introduction of metal moldings in buildings also created a problem for the union. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America claimed jurisdiction over trim and moldings, which had previously been made of wood. The carpenters' union had won a jurisdictional award from an arbitrator in New York City in the spring of 1909. But the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers demanded that the Building Trades Department (BTD) of the AFL issue a ruling. By a 3-to-1 majority, delegates to the Building Trades convention voted in favor of the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. The carpenters, then the second-largest union in the AFL, withdrew from the Building Trades and initiated a series of jurisdictional strikes against the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers at job sites nationwide. The BTD retaliated by asking AFL president Samuel Gompers to revoke the carpenter's union charter. Instead, Gompers led the AFL executive council in demanding that the BTD reinstate the carpenters' union. The Building Trades did so in 1910, but continued to vote in favor of the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' claims on work. The carpenters' union disaffiliated again. The carpenters' union continued to conduct strikes against the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers, and increasingly won the support of building contractors and local building trades councils. The National Board of Jurisdictional Awards also voted in favor of the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. But the pressure by the much larger carpenters' union proved too great, and the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers conceded jurisdiction over interior work in 1926.Palladino, Strong Hands, Skilled Spirits, 2005. The Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' railroad affiliates were deeply involved in the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, which proved to be a disaster for the union's railway unions. The Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' absorbed the chandelier, brass, and metal workers in 1924, and once more changed its name‚Äîthis time to the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association. In 1926, the Sheet Metal Workers co-founded the Railway Labor Executives' Association, a union lobbying group. In the spring of 1927, members of Local 206 in San Diego, California, build structural reinforcements for Charles Lindbergh's aircraft, \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\". During World War II, Sheet Metal Workers members assisted in the building of buildings, experimental machinery, and atomic weapons-making equipment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the Manhattan Project. In 1946, the Sheet Metal Workers became one of the founding members of the Atomic Trades and Labor Council. The Sheet Metal Workers are notable for negotiating a number of \\"firsts\\" in the construction industry. In 1946, Local 28 in New York City negotiated the first local health and welfare plan in the construction industry. In 1950, Local 28 negotiated the first pension plan in the construction industry.\\"Edward F. Carlough, 81, Dies; Headed Sheet Metal Workers,\\" New York Times, July 12, 1985. In 1966, the union established its first national pension plans (one for construction workers, one for manufacturing workers). In 1960, the Sheet Metal Workers organized its first political action committee, the Political Action League (PAL). ==Leadership== The Sheet Metal Workers have a long history of stable leadership. Robert Byron headed the union from 1939 to 1959. For three decades afterward, the union was headed by a father-son team. Edward F. Carlough was elected president in 1959, and his son Edward J. Carlough succeeded him in 1971.\\"Edward F. Carlough, 81, Dies; Headed Sheet Metal Workers,\\" New York Times, July 12, 1985; Sullivan, \\"Edward Carlough, 62, Ex- Chief of Sheet Metal Workers Union,\\" New York Times, July 1, 1994. In 1993, Edward J. Carlough resigned as president of the Sheet Metal Workers after union members strongly criticized his lavish lifestyle and excessive spending. Carlough had a year left in his term.Swoboda, \\"Sheet Metal Union Head Steps Down,\\" Washington Post, July 15, 1993; Dine, \\"Local Leader Takes on Chief of Union, Wins,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 31, 1993. In 1993, Arthur Moore, a vice president of the union, was elected to succeed the younger Carlough as president. Moore won election as president outright in August 1994, and was active in the coalition which unseated AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland in 1995 and elected John Sweeney.Crowe, \\"5 More Union Heads Side Against AFL-CIO Prez,\\" Newsday, May 18, 1995. Moore retired after one term, and Michael J. Sullivan was elected president of the union.\\"Sullivan Assumes Presidency of Sheet Metal Workers' Union,\\" Engineering News-Record, March 8, 1999.

SMART stands for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers. ==Contributions to political campaigns== According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sheet Metal Workers Union was the United States' 27th largest donor to federal political campaigns and committees, having contributed over $51.8 million since 1989, over 90% of which went to the Democratic Party and other liberal groups. In the 2018 election cycle, SMART's political action committee ranked sixth in donations to federal candidates at nearly $2.8 million. ==Presidents== *Archibald Barnes, 1888‚Äì1889 *E.F.

Esrey (born 1940 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American businessman best known for his time as Chief Executive of Sprint Corporation. William now spends his time with his 5 grandchildren, William, Meg, Catherine, Madison, and Caroline or riding horses in Colorado. ==Biography== Esrey attended Swarthmore College in 1957, Denison University in 1961, and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1964. Esrey began his career in telecommunications in 1964 with AT&T.; After becoming the youngest executive officer in the history of the company, Esrey left in 1970, joining investment banking firm Dillon, Read & Co. in New York City where after one year he became a managing director. It was at this point that Esrey considered turning his back on business and going to medical school, having had an interest during his teenage years when taken under the wing of a Kansas City physician. Esrey was given a close-up look at the day-to-day work of a doctor, but decided to stay in businessWilliam Esrey-Sprint Communications ===Sprint Telecom=== In 1980, Esrey joined United Telecommunications as the executive vice president of corporate planning. In 1982, he became president of United Telecom Communications Inc., later named US Telecom. In 1985, Esrey was made president and CEO of United Telecommunications. In 1990, he became chairman of the company, which had now changed its name to Sprint. During his time in charge of Sprint, the company developed from a rural telephone company into a multibillion-dollar international corporation. Esrey served as Chairman of the Board for Sprint and United Telecom from 1990 to May 2003. He received many honors and awards and Business Week named him one of the top 25 business leaders in the world .In 1999, the board agreed to a merger with WorldCom, which failed due to antitrust concerns.Forbes.com - Magazine Article ===Tax=== During his time as CEO and Chairman with Sprint, Esrey was paid an average of $25.5million per annum, including cash, bonuses and stock options. Most of this \\"income\\" was in stock options whose value was not realized due to the tech crash in 2000. Esrey earned a seven-figure salary, with annual bonuses ranging from $220,000 to $1.38 million. It was at this point that the accounting firm Ernst & Young, Sprint's auditors, offered Esrey and Sprint COO Ron LeMay a scheme whereby the income taxes on their stock-option profits disappear for 30 years. Esrey and LeMay handed Ernst & Young $5.8 million to set up a tax shelter for their option income. But the tax shelter was not legal according to the IRS. Esrey and LeMay found they could owe over $100 million in taxes.

It is part of the University of Gothenburg and located on the island Tj√§rn√∂, Str√∂mstad Municipality in the northern part of Bohusl√§n province. TML was founded as a field station for university education in marine biology in 1963. During the first half of 1970s TML became manned year round, and scientists began to choose TML for their permanent place of work. The activities have expanded and diversified. 70 people now work permanently at TML. Within 10 minutes by boat lies the Koster fjord, a 247 meter deep fissure fault between the Koster Islands and the mainland. It is in deep-water contact with the remaining Skagerrak, the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean beyond, leading to oceanic salinity, 35 ‚Ä∞, in the bottom water. This is the only true oceanic environment in Sweden, with the highest number of marine species in Sweden. Between 5000 and 10000 species are to be found in the Skagerrak, and more than 200 of them do not occur elsewhere in Swedish waters. For instance, cold water reefs of stony corals could be found. Annually, about 500 university students, mainly from Gothenburg, attend courses at TML, lasting from one week to one term. A large proportion of the education is devoted to identification of marine algal and animal species. Other courses are more concerned with ecology, including training in experiments and investigations. Field education, on research vessels, in smaller boats and at the shore, are common. The major research programs are directed towards marine ecology, presented under six programs ‚Äì marine chemical ecology, evolution and genetics, biodiversity, biohydrodynamics, fishery biology and aquaculture, and integrated coastal zone management. Most scientists at TML belong to the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Gothenburg. TML is a resource for regional industry, decision-makers and authorities, and gives support for the development of research-based marine innovations and business projects. At TML anyone can book guided tours and beach excursions. During summer season the public also can visit the aquarium, listen to popular science lectures and participate in excursions with research vessel. == Sources == * Tj√§rn√∂ Marine Laboratory ==External links== *Tj√§rn√∂ Marine Laboratory Category:Marine biological stations Category:Scientific organizations based in Sweden Category:University of Gothenburg Category:Stockholm University ","title":"Tj√§rn√∂ Marine Biological Laboratory"},{"id":"9093752","text":"The Tremalzo Pass () (el. 1702 m.) is a mountain pass in Trentino in Italy.

It is based on the non- fiction book by Mar√≠a Seoane and H√©ctor Ruiz N√∫√±ez.. It stars Alejo Garc√≠a Pintos, Vita Escard√≥, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Jos√© Mar√≠a Monje, Pablo Machado, Adriana Salonia and H√©ctor Bidonde. The film, based on the actual events recorded in history as the \\"Night of the pencils\\" (La noche de los l√°pices), tells the story of seven students who, after protesting for lower bus fares for students in the city of La Plata, were abducted in September 1976, during Argentina's last dictatorship (1976 - 1983), and subsequently disappeared. Only one student survived to tell what happened. ==Plot== During a time of economic and political unrest and State-sponsored terrorism in Argentina in the mid-1970s, the students want reduced bus fares, so they take to the streets and protest in support of the boleto estudiantil: the students' ticket. At first, under Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n's government they succeed, but their protests draw hostile attention from the ensuing military regime led by Jorge Rafael Videla, which overthrows Per√≥n on March 24, 1976. The dictatorship announces that the \\"leftist agitators\\" will not be tolerated by the new \\"government\\". The increasingly violent crackdown on student gatherings is demonstrated when the police break up a school dance brandishing guns. On September 16, six students of the city of La Plata are kidnapped in the middle of the night, and the police claims ignorance about their whereabouts. This is the actual event that will later be called \\"Night of the Pencils\\". Pablo (Alejo Garc√≠a Pintos), the seventh member of the group, is abducted 5 days later by the police. He learns that his friends have been brutally tortured by governmental authorities and that he will receive the same treatment. The interrogators give him electric shocks while radio music and a pillow mask his cries. Pablo is set free and tells the truth about the group's horrific story. However, his classmates were never found and became part of the thousands of desaparecidos of the dictatorship, who were kidnapped and never seen again. ==Cast== * Alejo Garc√≠a Pintos as Pablo D√≠az * Vita Escard√≥ as Claudia Falcone * Leonardo Sbaraglia as Daniel * Jos√© Mar√≠a Monje as Panchito * Pablo Machado as Claudio * Adriana Salonia as Mar√≠a Clara * Tina Serrano as Mrs. Falcone * H√©ctor Bidonde as Mr. Falcone * Alfonso De Grazia as Priest impersonator * Lorenzo Quinteros as Ra√∫l * Juan Manuel Tenuta as the Rector ==Background== The motion picture was based on the non-fiction book, La noche de los l√°pices, written by Mar√≠a Seoane and H√©ctor Ruiz N√∫√±ez.

Thakur was appreciative of the direction of the film and wrote, \\"Olivera seems to have kept his integrity mostly intact. He does not shy away from disturbing realities, and he draws a surprisingly complex portrait of the students, their captors, and the students' parents. The film's accomplishment in this regard is considerable and therefore worthy of serious attention...[and] this is especially true of the film's second half.\\"Thakur, Manavendra K. The Tech, Volume 109, Number 54, page 9, December 1, 1989. Last accessed: January 15, 2008. Caryn James, film critic for The New York Times, also liked Olivera's work, and wrote, \\"Mr. Olivera builds his film on irony and contrast, so the visual beauty of the early scenes - the deep blue night in which cars and lights glisten - calls attention to the ominous unseen political dangers. In daylight, the once- beautiful, now crumbling buildings, including the high school itself, become emblems of a country falling apart, not knowing what to preserve from its past.\\"James, Caryn.

Its current headmaster is Mr Michael Stimpson. ==History== The school was founded as St Michael's Convent in 1908 by the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus and is now under their trusteeship. It was the first Roman Catholic school in Finchley since the Reformation. As were many Catholic schools in London at that time, it was a small fee-paying school serving the parish. Under the Education Act 1944, in 1958, St Michael's became a voluntary aided grammar school to complement the all-boys Finchley Catholic Grammar School (now Finchley Catholic High School). When the Barnet LEA abolished the tripartite system, St Michael's did not turn comprehensive and has remained a grammar school to this day. ==Ofsted inspection reports== : St Michael's is a high achieving school where relationships are excellent. The pupils are happy and well cared for morally, socially and spiritually. The school's national reputation in the Catholic community is justifiably high. (Ofsted, 1995) :St Michael's is an exceptional school; which is outstandingly effective because of its excellent leadership, management, teaching and learning (Ofsted, 2005) ==St Michael's curriculum== The pupils study Religious Education, English, Mathematics, Latin, French, German, Spanish, Italian, History, Geography, Science, Music, Art, Physical Education, Drama, Technology, ICT and Education for Living with Citizenship. Pupils have a choice of either Food/Graphics Technology as well as Physical Education. St Michael's collaborates with nearby Finchley Catholic High School to offer an extensive range of subjects ranging from the usual taught at KS3 and KS4. This collaboration has meant both schools have the most subjects to offer its pupils in Sixth Form, in North London. Some of these subjects include Photography, Music Technology, Classical Civilisation, Politics, Economics, Business Studies, Physiology, Sociology, Accountancy. ==St Michael's traditionsSchool uniform=== The school has a distinctive purple uniform, which is the colour of the St. Michael's flower, the Michaelmas Daisy. It consists of a pleated purple skirt, a lilac shirt and purple jumper. In addition there is a purple blazer which must be worn when travelling to and from the school. In the winter there is also a long black coat which pupils have to wear instead of the blazer to and from school. This royal purple symbolises the status of St. Michael as the archangel who quelled the rebellion of Lucifer. The School motto \\"Quis ut deus\\" is a Latin translation of the sarcastic rhetorical question uttered by Archangel Michael as he slew Lucifer: \\"Who is like God?\\" (The name 'Michael' in fact derives from the Hebrew form of this question.) ===School song=== The school song Dux Michael, which is sung in Latin praising St. Michael the Archangel, protector and defender of the faith. It is always sung on St. Michael's Day and at various key stage certificate assemblies along with the school prayer. Here is the song: :O heros invincibilis, Dux Michael. :Adesto nostris praeliis, ora pro nobis. :Pugna pro nobis, pugna pro nobis, :Dux Michael. :Tu noster dux militiae, Dux Michael. :Defensor es Ecclesiae, ora pro nobis. :Pugna pro nobis, pugna pro nobis, :Dux Michael. :Per te o heros belliger, Dux Michael. :Prostratus jacet Lucifer, ora pro nobis. :Pugna pro nobis, pugna pro nobis, :Dux Michael. :Ab omni malo libera, Dux Michael. :Ad coeli duc nos praemia, ora pro nobis. :Pugna pro nobis, pugna pro nobis, :Dux Michael. ===Committees and clubs=== In Year 12, a husting takes place to elect the Head Girl/Boy and the two Deputies at St. Michael's. As well as this, several committees and clubs are set up according to the interests of the girls, which vary each year. The pupils are welcome to start their own club or committee along with the help of Year 12 pupils and the permission of the headteacher. Some of the committees and clubs this year include Athletics, Art, Book, Chess, Year 7 Choir, Glee Club, Chamber Choir, Drama, Cultural, Debate, Italian Film, French Film, Justice and Peace, Language, Library, Magazine, Mandarin Chinese, Netball, Badminton, Chamber Orchestra, Junior Orchestra, Jazz Band, Cheerleading, Poetry, Prom, Spanish Film and Year Book. ===School events=== St Michael's Day is the most important day of the academic year at St Michael's. Here the whole school, pupils and staff, join in celebration of mass in the school hall with a liturgy of music and drama. After mass, free ice cream is given out to its pupils and staff in celebration of St Michael the Archangel. Mass is not only celebrated on St Michael's Day but liturgies are prepared on the Holy Days of Obligation found in the Catholic Calendar there are also masses on every Friday lunchtime as well as on the last days of term, part of St Michael's Catholic ethos along with prayers said daily, and Mass weekly by the school's chaplain, Father John Ball, who has been the chaplain since the 1970s. The staff assembly takes place on the last school assembly before the term breaks for Christmas. It is here that the staff organise an assembly for its pupils, either a talent show or a mini pantomime. Many events are organised throughout the year organised by the staff or various committees. An example includes the Cultural and Charity Committee who organise the traditional \\"Ireland v. The Rest of the World\\" netball match played by the staff on St Patrick's Day, with all monies raised going to charity. St Michael's celebrated their centenary on 28 September 2008, the day before St Michael's Day. The Duke of Gloucester was invited to the school to mark the centenary with the opening of the new sports hall. ==Notable former pupils== *Natasha Collins, children's TV presenter who died of drug overdose *Karen Harrison, first woman in Britain to be appointed as a train driver, trade unionist and political campaigner *Lisa Jewell, author *Jill Paton Walsh, author *Jessica Martin, actress and comedienne ==References== ==External links== *St. Michael's Catholic Grammar School website *Finchley Catholic High School website *School Magazine Category:Grammar schools in the London Borough of Barnet Category:Girls' schools in London Category:Educational institutions established in 1908 Category:Catholic secondary schools in the Archdiocese of Westminster Category:1908 establishments in England Category:Voluntary aided schools in London Category:Finchley ","title":"St Michael's Catholic Grammar School"},{"id":"9093834","text":"WFLO is a Country formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Farmville, Virginia, serving Farmville and Prince Edward County, Virginia.

He was a brother to naturalist Karl Friedrich Schimper (1803‚Äì1867). Wilhelm Schimper studied natural history in Munich, and for a short period of time worked with geologist Louis Agassiz as a draftsman and illustrator. In 1831 he undertook a botanical collection trip to Algiers, about which, he published Reise nach Algier in den jahren 1831 und 1832.Google Books Wilhelm Schimper's Reise nach Algier in den jahren 1831 und 1832 A few years later he conducted botanical research in Egypt and the Sinai,ADB:Schimper, Wilhelm at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie eventually settling in Ethiopia in 1836. During his time spent in Ethiopia, he had residences in Tigray and Semien provinces. For a period of time he was governor of Enticho, a district in Tigray, under the rule of Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam, who had him marry Mirritsit, a woman from a prominent family in Adwa, who bore him several children. Although he was imprisoned at Magdala by Emperor Tewodros II, otherwise he suffered no serious losses during that unsettled time. While in Ethiopia, he maintained correspondence with botanists in Europe, and made valuable contributions to natural history collections in Paris and Berlin. He was also a collector for Unio Itineraria (Der Esslinger Botanische Reiseverein) in W√ºrttemberg. During the years 1864 to 1868 he wrote an extensive report on his observations made in the course of his botanical trips through Tigray in northern Ethiopia.

He is now known as Michinoku Oyakata and is the head coach of Michinoku stable. ==Early career== Beginning his career in March 1975, Kazumi Yoshinaga, as he then was, joined the Izutsu stable. He was given the sumo name Kirishima, which came from the national park in his native Kagoshima Prefecture. He did not become established as an elite sekitori wrestler until November 1983 when he produced a 9‚Äì6 score at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 10 (he had made the j≈´ry≈ç division briefly in May 1982 but had lasted only one tournament there). He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in July 1984, and won a sansh≈ç or special prize for Fighting Spirit in his very first tournament. His good looks and slim build made him popular with female sumo fans, and he was sometimes called \\"the Alain Delon of Japan.\\" Persistently struggling to gain weight, he enlisted the help of his girlfriend and future wife Naoko in the quest to bulk up and avoid frequent defeats by simple push-out. He was also a fitness fanatic who started his career by running several kilometres even before morning training started at 6am.Sumo Through the Wrestlers' Eyes (2011) Gould, Chris https://www.amazon.com/Sumo- through-Wrestlers-Eyes-ebook/dp/B006C1I5K8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital- text&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1322584827&sr;=1-1 One of the lightest wrestlers in the division, Kirishima earned a reputation as a giant-killer, defeating heavyweights such as ≈ånokuni and Konishiki several times. However, he seemed to struggle when promoted out of the maegashira ranks. After finishing tournament runner-up and winning the Technique Prize in November 1986 he was promoted to the san'yaku ranks for the first time at sekiwake in the following tournament but could only manage a 3‚Äì12 record, and when he finally managed to return to san'yaku at komusubi rank in January 1989 he recorded a dismal 1‚Äì14. However, later that year he began a new training regime. In addition to his usual practice matches at Izutsu stable, he did regular weight training at a private gymnasium, and supplemented his normal sumo diet with a specially prepared high calorie and high protein drink. His efforts paid off. He returned to komusubi in November 1989 scoring 10 wins, and then turned in an 11‚Äì4 mark and runner-up performance in January 1990. In March 1990 at sekiwake he produced a superb 13‚Äì2 record, defeating yokozuna Chiyonofuji (for the first time in twelve attempts) and Hokutoumi and all three ≈çzeki. He took part in a rare three-way playoff with Konishiki and Hokutoumi, who had also finished on 13‚Äì2. Although Hokutoumi took the title, after the tournament Kirishima was promoted to ≈çzeki. It was his second straight runner-up performance, earning him his third Outstanding Performance and fourth Technique Prizes, and a three tournament record of 34 wins and 11 losses. ==≈åzeki== Kirishima had reached sumo's second highest rank at the age of nearly 31, and the 91 tournaments it took him is the slowest ever promotion to ≈çzeki. The highlight of his career came in January 1991 when he took his first y≈´sh≈ç or tournament title, gaining his revenge on Hokutoumi by defeating him on the last day. He defeated three yokozuna on three consecutive days in this tournament, a feat not achieved again by a non-yokozuna until Kotosh≈çgiku did it in January 2016. It was also the first top division championship for Izutsu stable in over sixty years. It had taken him a record 96 career tournaments to win a top division y≈´sh≈ç for the first time, and he was also the oldest first time winner at 31 years and nine months. (Both of these records are now held by Kyokutenh≈ç.) Kirishima finished 1991 with 62 wins, which was more than any other top division wrestler in the calendar year, although it was the lowest number ever needed to achieve that feat. He was only the second non-yokozuna after Wakashimazu in 1984 to do so. He was also runner-up in the tournaments of September 1991, March 1992 and July 1992. However, in September of that year he could only manage a 7‚Äì8 score after being restricted by an elbow injury, and he had to pull out of the November tournament on Day 8 with only one win after he ruptured ankle ligaments in a bout against Mitoizumi. As a result, he lost his ≈çzeki status. ==Later career and retirement== Rather than retire, Kirishima chose to carry on fighting in the maegashira ranks. Rather unusually for a former ≈çzeki, he did not own toshiyori (elder) stock in the Sumo Association and so would have had to borrow a share from an active wrestler or use his own fighting name for a three year grace period if he had retired at that point. The cost of stock had risen sharply and his main sponsor, a real estate company, was going through financial difficulties. In May 1994 he fought fellow ex-≈çzeki Konishiki, the first time in 35 years that two former ≈çzeki had met in the maegashira ranks (≈åuchiyama vs Mitsuneyama in 1959 was the previous occasion). The two rivals became friends off the dohyo, and finished with a head-to-head split evenly at 19 wins each in 38 encounters. In March 1996 he produced a poor 3‚Äì12 record, and facing certain demotion to j≈´ry≈ç, he announced his retirement after 21 years in the sport, just short of his 37th birthday. He was the oldest wrestler in any of the professional sumo divisions at the time of his retirement, and was the last active wrestler born in the 1950s. As well as a loss of physical strength and an accumulation of injuries he had lost about 10 kilos in weight since his ≈çzeki days. He at first borrowed his stablemate Terao's Shikoroyama elder name, then when that was needed by the retiring Kotogaume he used Tagary≈´'s Katsunoura name before securing the Michinoku name and becoming the head of the Michinoku stable in December 1997. He has produced several wrestlers with top division experience, including J≈´monji, Toyozakura and Hakuba. In February 2010 he was elected to the Sumo Association's board of Directors, but was forced to step down from his post in April 2011 when four of his wrestlers (J≈´monji, Toyozakura, Hakuba and Kirinowaka) were ordered to retire after being found guilty of match-fixing. The stable absorbed Izutsu stable, Kirishima's old heya, in October 2019. He manages a chanko restaurant, Chanko Kirishima, on Kokugikan Street in Ryogoku, which is one of the more successful restaurants run by ex-wrestlers. ==Fighting style== Kirishima was a yotsu sumo wrestler who preferred grappling techniques to pushing and thrusting. His favoured grip on the opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri (force out), and he was also fond of uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw) and utchari (ring edge throw), the latter of which he memorably used to defeat yokozuna ≈ånokuni in September 1988, his first ever kinboshi. His trademark, however, was tsuri-dashi (lift out), a technique requiring tremendous strength and seldom seen today due to the increasing weight of wrestlers and the risk of back injury. Kirishima used tsuri-dashi 29 times in the 15-year period from January 1990, more than any other wrestler. He used it to defeat Chiyonofuji on the sixth day of the March 1990 tournament, leaving Chiyonofuji stuck on 999 wins and delaying the celebrations in the stadium of what would have been the yokozuna's 1000th career victory. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo elders *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of ≈çzeki ==References== ==External links== * Kirishima's tournament results Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Kagoshima Prefecture Category:≈åzeki ","title":"Kirishima Kazuhiro"},{"id":"9093853","text":"In May 1959, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors created Loudoun County Sanitation Authority (LCSA) by a resolution, through the Water and Waste Authorities Act, for the sole purpose of providing water and wastewater service to residents of the unincorporated areas of the county. LCSA rebranded and moved from Leesburg to Ashburn in April 2008. It now does business as Loudoun Water. Loudoun Water is a political subdivision of the state, similar to a town or a county government. All income is received either as user fees from customers or availability fees from developers. User fees pay for operating expenses. Availability fees pay for capital improvements. Loudoun Water receives no tax revenues. ==Board of directors== Loudoun Water's nine- member Board governs how it operates and generally meets every second Thursday of the month. These meetings are open to the public. Each member of the Board is appointed at-large by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors and serves a four-year term. These terms are staggered, so that every year, two members are re-appointed and every fourth year, three members are re-appointed. The Authority's Board appoints a General Manager who is responsible for the daily management of Loudoun Water. ==Water and Wastewater Operations== Loudoun Water purchases its water from Fairfax Water (Fairfax County Water Authority) and Loudoun Water's Goose Creek Water Treatment Facility. A small percentage of Loudoun Water's customers are part of Community Systems. Customers within these systems have community wells and / or small communal wastewater systems. Wastewater in the Central Service Area is sent to the Broad Run Water Reclamation Facility, owned and operated by Loudoun Water, or conveyed to the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant operated by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. ==Aquiary== Loudoun Water created an indoor education center and outdoor interpretive area called The Aquiary (ƒÅ‚Ä¢kwee‚Ä¢air‚Ä¢ee). The Aquiary is like a water museum, full of interactive exhibits and interpretive trails that tell the story of drinking water treatment and delivery; source water protection; water conservation and water reclamation. The Aquiary was named by one of the citizen members of the advisory group that advised Loudoun Water on the content and appearance of the space. It is a made-up word that rhymes with aviary, and means ‚Äúa place for Loudoun water learning and appreciation.‚Äù Brainstorming for the space and the trail system began in 2003 when Loudoun Water first decided to build a campus in Ashburn, next to its Operations and Maintenance facility. Loudoun Water worked with consultants and a citizen advisory group, comprising a diverse array of Loudoun Water customer volunteers, to develop the exhibits and the space. Loudoun Water has intended the Aquiary to serve as a learning and teaching tool for Loudoun County Public Schools, and consulted with teachers and the school administration to ensure its effectiveness as a field trip destination.

People with this condition often misinterpret others' behaviors, e.g. sniffing, touching nose or opening a window, as being referential to an unpleasant body odor which in reality is non-existent and can not be detected by other people. This disorder is often accompanied by shame, embarrassment, significant distress, avoidance behavior, social phobia and social isolation. ==Signs and symptoms== The onset of ORS may be sudden, where it usually follows after a precipitating event, or gradual. ===Odor complaint=== The defining feature of ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may report that the odor comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (bad breath); the anus; the genitals; the skin generally; or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There are also some who are unsure of the exact origin of the odor. The odor is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of the odor may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively it may be an unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of the odor complaint may change over time. Halitosis appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of bad breath, alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%). Although all individuals with ORS believe they have an odor, in some cases the individual reports they cannot perceive the odor themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of the odor (i.e. anosmia) exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (olfactory hallucination). Olfactory hallucination can be considered the result of the belief in an odor delusion, or the belief a result of the olfactory hallucination. In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that he or she could detect the odor themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present. Some distinguish delusional and non-delusional forms of ORS. In the delusional type, there is complete conviction that the odor is real. In the non-delusional type, the individual is capable of some insight into the condition, and can recognize that the odor might not be real, and that their level of concern is excessive. Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of delusional intensity, it is argued that considering the condition as a form of delusional disorder, as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that the odor was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that the odor was not existent. Other symptoms may be reported and are claimed to be related to the cause of the odor, such as malfunction of the anal sphincter, a skin disease, \\"diseased womb\\", stomach problems or other unknown organic disease. Excessive washing in ORS has been reported to cause the development of eczema. ===Referential ideas=== People with ORS misinterpret the behavior of others to be related to the imagined odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity to others who are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will be convinced that the conversation is about his or her odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor. ===Repetitive behavior=== 95% of persons with ORS engage in at least one excessive hygiene, grooming or other related repetitive practice in an attempt to alleviate, mask and monitor the perceived odor. This has been described as a contrite reaction, and repetitive, counterphobic, \\"safety\\", ritual or compulsive behaviors. Despite these measures, the odor symptom is reported to still offend other people. Example ORS behaviors include: repetitive showering and other grooming behaviors, excessive tooth brushing, or tongue scraping (a treatment for halitosis), repeated smelling of oneself to check for any odor, over-frequent bathroom use, attempts to mask the odor, with excessive use of deodorants, perfumes, mouthwash, mint, chewing gum, scented candles, and soap; changing clothes (e.g. underwear), multiple times per day, frequent washing of clothes, wearing several layers of clothing, wrapping feet in plastic, wearing garments marketed as odor-reducing, eating special diets, dietary supplements (e.g. intended to reduce flatulence odor), repeatedly seeking reassurance from others that there is no odor, although the negative response is usually interpreted instead as politeness rather than truth, and avoidance behaviors such habitually sitting at a distance from others, minimizing movement in an attempt \\"not to spread the odor\\", keeping the mouth closed and avoiding talking or talking with a hand in front of the mouth. ===Functional impairment=== Persons with ORS tend to develop a behavior pattern of avoidance of social activities and progressive social withdrawal. They often avoid travel, dating, relationships, break off engagements and avoid family activities. Due to shame and embarrassment, they may avoid school or work, or repeatedly change jobs and move to another town. Significant developments may occur such as loss of employment, divorce, becoming housebound, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide attempts. According to some reports, 74% of persons with ORS avoid social situations, 47% avoid work, academic or other important activities, 40% had been housebound for at least once week because of ORS, and 31.6% had experienced psychiatric hospitalization. With regards suicide, reports range from 43-68% with suicidal ideation, and 32% with a history of at least one suicide attempt. 5.6% died by suicide. ===Psychiatric co-morbidity=== Psychiatric co-morbidity in ORS is reported. Depression, which is often severe, may be a result of ORS, or may be pre-existing. Personality disorders, especially cluster C, and predominantly the avoidant type, may exist with ORS. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, hypochondriasis, alcohol or drug abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder may also be co-morbid with ORS. ==Causes== The causes of ORS are unknown. It is thought that significant negative experiences may trigger the development of ORS. These have been considered as two types: key traumatic experiences related to smell, and life stressors present when the condition developed but which were unrelated to smell. In one review, 85% of reported cases had traumatic, smell-related experiences, and 17% of cases had stress factors unrelated to smell. Reported smell-related experiences usually revolve around family members, friends, co- workers, peers or other people making comments about an odor from the person, which causes embarrassment and shame. Examples include accusation of flatulence during a religious ceremony, or being bullied for flatulence such at school, accidental urination in class, announcements about a passenger needing to use deodorant over speaker by a driver on public transport, sinusitis which caused a bad taste in the mouth, mockery about a fish odor from a finger which had been inserted into the person's vagina in the context of a sexual assault, and revulsion about menarche and brother's sexual intimacy. It has been suggested that a proportion of such reported experiences may not have been real, but rather early symptom of ORS (i.e. referential thoughts). Examples of non smell-related stressful periods include guilt due to a romantic affair, being left by a partner, violence in school, family illness when growing up (e.g. cancer), and bullying. The importance of a family history of mental illness or other conditions in ORS is unclear, because most reported cases have lacked this information. In some cases, there has been reported psychiatric and medical conditions in first degree relatives such as schizophrenia, psychosis, alcoholism, suicide, affective disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, paranoia, neurosis, sociopathy, and epilepsy. Sometimes more than one family member had a noteworthy condition. Neuroimaging has been used to investigate ORS. Hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) demonstrated hypoperfusion of the frontotemporal lobe in one case. That is to say, part of the brain was receiving insufficient blood flow. In another, functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out while the person with ORS listened to both neutral words and emotive words. Compared to an age and sex matched healthy control subject under the same conditions, the individual with ORS showed more activation areas in the brain when listening to emotionally loaded words. This difference was described as abnormal, but less pronounced as would be observed in the brain of a person with a psychotic disorder. ==DiagnosisClassification=== Although the existence of ORS is generally accepted, there is some controversy as to whether it is a distinct condition or merely a part or manifestation of other psychiatric conditions, mainly due to the overlapping similarities. Similarly, there is controversy with regards how the disorder should be classified. As ORS has obsessive and compulsive features, some consider it as a type of obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder, while others consider it an anxiety disorder due to the strong anxiety component. It is also suggested to be a type of body dysmorphic disorder or, as it involves a single delusional belief, some suggest that ORS is a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (hypochondriacal type of delusional disorder, see monothematic delusion). The World Health Organization's 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) does not have a specific entry for ORS, or use the term, but in the \\"persistent delusional disorders\\" section, states delusions can \\"express a conviction that others think that they smell.\\" ORS has also never been allocated a dedicated entry in any edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In the third edition (DSM-III), ORS was mentioned under \\"atypical somatoform disorders\\". The revised third edition (DSM-III-R) mentions ORS in the text, stating: \\"convictions that the person emits a foul odor are one of the most common types of delusion disorder, somatic type.\\" The fourth edition (DSM-IV), does not use the term ORS but again mentions such a condition under \\"delusional disorder, somatic type\\", stating \\"somatic delusions can occur in several forms. Most common are the person's conviction that he or she emits a foul odor from the skin, mouth, rectum or vagina.\\" In the fifth edition (DSM-5), ORS again does not appear as a distinct diagnosis, but it is mentioned in relation to taijin ky≈çfush≈ç (ÂØæ‰∫∫ÊÅêÊÄñÁóá, \\"disorder of fear of personal interaction\\"). The variants of taijin ky≈çfush≈ç (shubo-kyofu \\"the phobia of a deformed body\\" and jikoshu-kyofu \\"fear of foul body odor\\") are listed under 300.3 (F42) \\"other specified obsessive compulsive and related disorders\\", and is about someone's fear that his or her body, or its functions, is offensive to other people. There are four subtypes of taijin ky≈çfush≈ç. 17% of these individuals suffer from \\"the phobia of having foul body odor\\", the subtype termed jikoshu-kyofu. Although taijin ky≈çfush≈ç has been described as a culture-bound syndrome confined to east Asia (e.g. Japan and Korea), it has been suggested that the jikoshu-kyofu variant of taijin ky≈çfush≈ç is closely related or identical to ORS, and that such a condition occurs in other cultures. However, some Western sources state that jikoshu-kyofu and ORS are distinguishable because of cultural differences, i.e. Western culture being primarily concerned with individual needs, and Japanese culture primarily with the needs of the many. Hence, it is claimed that ORS mainly focuses on the affected individual's embarrassment, and jikoshu-kyofu is focused on the fear of creating embarrassment in others. In this article, jikoshu-kyofu and ORS are considered as one condition. Synonyms for ORS, many historical, include bromidrosiphobia, olfactory phobic syndrome, chronic olfactory paranoid syndrome, autodysomophobia, delusions of bromosis, hallucinations of smell and olfactory delusional syndrome. By definition, the many terms which have been suggested in the dental literature to refer to subjective halitosis complaints (i.e. where a person complains of halitosis yet no odor is detectable clinically) can also be considered under the umbrella of ORS. Examples include halitophobia, non-genuine halitosis, delusional halitosis, pseudo-halitosis, imaginary halitosis, psychosomatic halitosis, and self halitosis. ===Diagnostic criteria=== Diagnostic criteria have been proposed for ORS: * Persistent (> six months), false belief that one emits an offensive odor, which is not perceived by others. There may be degrees of insight (i.e. the belief may or may not be of delusional intensity). * This pre-occupation causes clinically significant distress (depression, anxiety, shame), social and occupational disability, or may be time-consuming (i.e. preoccupies the individual at least one hour per day). * The belief is not a symptom of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, and not due to the effects of medication or recreational drug abuse, or any other general medical condition. ===Differential diagnosis=== The differential diagnosis for ORS may be complicated as the disorder shares features with other conditions. Consequently, ORS may be misdiagnosed as another medical or psychiatric condition and vice versa. The typical history of ORS involves a long delay while the person continues to believe there is a genuine odor. On average, a patient with ORS goes undiagnosed for about eight years. Repeated consultation with multiple different non-psychiatric medical specialists (\\"doctor shopping\\") in an attempt to have their non-existent body odor treated is frequently reported. Individuals with ORS may present to dermatologists, gastroentrologists, otolaryngologists, dentists, proctologists, and gynecologists. Despite the absence of any clinically detectable odor, physicians and surgeons may embark on unnecessary investigations (e.g. gastroscopy), and treatments, including surgery such as thoracic sympathectomy, tonsillectomy, etc. Such treatments generally have no long-term effect on the individual's belief in an odor symptom. If non-psychiatric clinicians refuse to carry out treatment on the basis that there is no real odor and offer to refer them to a psychologist or psychiatrist, persons with ORS typically refuse and instead seek \\"a better\\" doctor/dentist. Conversely, some have suggested that medical conditions which cause genuine odor may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ORS. There are a great many different medical conditions which are reported to potentially cause a genuine odor, and these are usually considered according to the origin of the odor, e.g. halitosis (bad breath), bromhidrosis (body odor), etc. These conditions are excluded before a diagnosis of ORS is made. Although there are a multitude of different publications on topics like halitosis, the symptom is still poorly understood and managed in practice. It is recognized that symptoms such as halitosis can be intermittent, and therefore may not be present at the time of the consultation, leading to misdiagnosis. Individuals with genuine odor symptoms may present with similar mindset and behavior to persons with ORS. For example, one otolaryngologist researcher noted \\"behavioral problems such as continuous occupation with oral hygiene issues, obsessive use of cosmetic breath freshening products such as mouthwashes, candies, chewing gums, and sprays, avoiding close contact with other people, and turning the head away during conversation\\" as part of what was termed \\"skunk syndrome\\" in patients with genuine halitosis secondary to chronic tonsillitis. Another author, writing about halitosis, noted that there are generally three types of persons that complain of halitosis: those with above average odor, those with average or near-average odor who are oversensitive, and those with below average or no odor who believe they have offensive breath. Therefore, in persons with genuine odor complaints, the distress and concern may typically be out of proportion to the reality of the problem. Genuine halitosis has been described as a social barrier between the individual and friends, relatives, partners and colleagues, and may negatively alter self-esteem and quality of life. Similar psychosocial problems are reported in other conditions which cause genuine odor symptoms. In the literature on halitosis, emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor. Various organic diseases may cause parosmias (distortion of the sense of smell). Also, since smell and taste are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and ORS have some demographic and clinical similarities. Where the social anxiety and avoidance behavior is primarily focussed on concern about body odors, ORS is a more appropriate diagnosis than avoidant personality disorder or SAD. Body dismorphic disorder (BDD) has been described as the closest diagnosis in DSM- IV to ORS as both primarily focus on bodily symptoms. The defining difference between the two is that in BDD the preoccupation is with physical appearance not body odors. Similarly, where obsessive behaviors are directly and consistently related to body odors rather than anything else, ORS is a more appropriate diagnosis than obsessive compulsive disorder, in which obsessions are different and multiple over time. ORS may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. About 13% of schizophrenics have olfactory hallucinations. Generally, schizophrenic hallucinations are perceived as having an imposed, external origin, while in ORS they are recognized as originating from the individual. The suggested diagnostic criteria mean that the possibility of ORS is negated by a diagnosis of schizophrenia in which persistent delusions of an offensive body odor and olfactory hallucinations are contributing features for criterion A. However, some reported ORS cases were presented as co-morbid. Indeed, some have suggested that ORS may in time transform into schizophrenia, but others state there is little evidence for this. Persons with ORS have none of the other criteria to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that various special investigations may be indicated to help rule out some of the above conditions. Depending upon the case, this might include neuroimaging, thyroid and adrenal hormone tests, and analysis of body fluids (e.g. blood) with gas chromatography. ==Treatment== There is no agreed treatment protocol. In most reported cases of ORS the attempted treatment was antidepressants, followed by antipsychotics and various psychotherapies. Little data are available regarding the efficacy of these treatments in ORS, but some suggest that psychotherapy yields the highest rate of response to treatment, and that antidepressants are more efficacious than antipsychotics (response rates 78%, 55% and 33% respectively). According to one review, 43% of cases which showed overall improvement required more than one treatment approach, and in only 31% did the first administered treatment lead to some improvement. Pharmacotherapies that have been used for ORS include antidepressants, (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors), antipsychotics, (e.g. blonanserin, lithium, chlorpromazine), and benzodiazepines. The most common treatment used for ORS is SSRIs. Specific antidepressants that have been used include clomipramine. Psychotherapies that have been used for ORS include cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Dunne (2015) reported a Case Study treatment of ORS using EMDR which was successful using a trauma model formulation rather than an OCD approach. ==Prognosis== When untreated, the prognosis for ORS is generally poor. It is chronic, lasting many years or even decades with worsening of symptoms rather than spontaneous remission. Transformation to another psychiatric condition is unlikely, although very rarely what appears to be ORS may later manifest into schizophrenia, psychosis, mania, or major depressive disorder. The most significant risk is suicide. When treated, the prognosis is better. In one review, the proportion of treated ORS cases which reported various outcomes were assessed. On average, the patients were followed for 21 months (range: two weeks to ten years). With treatment, 30% recovered (i.e. no longer experienced ORS odor beliefs and thoughts of reference), 37% improved and in 33% there was a deterioration in the condition (including suicide) or no change from the pre-treatment status. ==Epidemiology== Cases have been reported from many different countries around the world. It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of ORS in the general population because data are limited and unreliable, and due to the delusional nature of the condition and the characteristic secrecy and shame. For unknown reasons, males appear to be affected twice as commonly as females. High proportions of ORS patients are unemployed, single, and not socially active. The average age reported is around 20‚Äì21 years, with almost 60% of cases occurring in subjects under 20 in one report, although another review reported an older average age for both males (29) and females (40). ==History== The term olfactory reference syndrome was first proposed in 1971 by William Pryse-Phillips. Prior to this, published descriptions of what is now thought to be ORS appear from the late 1800s, with the first being Potts 1891. Often the condition was incorrectly described as other conditions, e.g. schizophrenia. ==Society== In modern times, commercial advertising pressures have altered the public's attitude towards problems such as halitosis, which have taken on greater negative psychosocial sequelae as a result. For example, in the United States, a poll reported that 55‚Äì75 million citizens consider bad breath a \\"principal concern\\" during social encounters. ==Etymology== The term olfactory reference syndrome comes from: * Olfactory, pertaining to the sense of smell. * Reference, because of the belief that the behavior of others is referential to a supposed odor. * Syndrome, because it is a recognizable set of features that occur together. ==References== 30em Dunne, T.P.

He graduated from St Peter's College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, and went on to obtain a diploma in music and a teaching diploma. He then taught English and Mathematics in Alice until 1947. During this period, Matshikiza composed songs and choral works; in particular \\"Hamba Kahle\\", now a standard South Africa piece. Matshikiza moved to Johannesburg in 1947 where he got married in 1950. He taught for a while and opened the Todd Matshikiza School of Music, a private music school, where he taught piano. His main interest was jazz. As this did not bring in a regular income, he worked in a bookshop and then as a salesman. From 1949 to 1954, Matshikiza was a committee member of the Syndicate of African Artists, which group aimed to promote music in the townships by getting visiting artists to perform there. In 1952, Matshikiza was asked to join Drum magazine and was one of the first writers, together with investigative journalist Henry Nxumalo. He wrote a jazz column covering the township scene, particularly in Sophiatown, where he commented on the likes of Kippie Moeketsi and Hugh Masekela, who both played for The Jazz Epistles. Matshikiza also covered township life in his regular column \\"With the lid off\\". He subsequently worked for the Golden City Post. His love of classical music inspired him to compose the choral piece Makhaliphile in 1953, which he dedicated to Trevor Huddleston. This was a combination of classical, jazz and traditional themes. In 1956, he composed Uxolo (peace), commissioned for the 70th anniversary of Johannesburg. In 1958, Matshikiza composed the music and contributed to the lyrics of the musical King Kong, which had an all-black cast. Portraying the life and times of a heavyweight boxer, Ezekiel Dlamini, known as King Kong, this musical was a hit in 1959 and played in the West End of London in 1961. (King Kong launched the international career of Miriam Makeba, who played the shebeen queen of the Back of the Moon, a shebeen of the time in Sophiatown). Frustrated by apartheid, Matshikiza moved to England in 1960. However, he found it very difficult to break into the English music scene. Sometimes he played jazz gigs in nightclubs. He freelanced for various publications and wrote a regular column for Drum entitled \\"Todd in London\\". Missing Africa, Matshikiza moved in 1964 to Zambia, where he worked for the Zambian Broadcasting Corporation. Again, he felt stifled musically and took up a position in 1967 as the music archivist for the Zambian Information Service. In this capacity he travelled extensively, building up the archival collection. Matshikiza remained frustrated that he was unable to return to South Africa where he had been banned by the South African government. He died in 1968.

For the type of cattle, see Gascon cattle. For the type of language, see Gascon language. The Gascon Saintongeois (FCI No.21) is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, recognised in two sizes, Grand (large) and Petit (smaller than the Grand, but not a small dog). Originating in France, the breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog. == Characteristics == The breed is a very typical French hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, long drop ears and pendulous flews (lips). The size for the Grand is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females at total 24 to 26 inches; the size for the Petit is 56 to 62 cm (22 to 24.4 ins) at the withers, making it still a fairly large dog; females are slightly smaller. Grands weigh 66 to 71 pounds. The eyes are dark chestnut. It has an elongated head. Its black nose is well-developed and the lips are pendent. It has a deep chest and a strong back. The tail is elegant and saber. Petit Gascon Saintongeois The colour of the coat is white with black patches, sometimes speckled or ticked with black. Ears and face around the eyes are black and the cheeks are tan, but there should not be a tricolour appearance. Two tan markings are above the eyes, and sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the \\"roe buck mark\\". Faults, which indicate the dog should not be bred, include lack of substance, weak back, deviated tail, cow-hocked, or legs that are too angulated or straight, which would impede running ability, as well as being off-colour or overly aggressive or overly shy. The breed is noted for its good nose, excellent voice and beautiful gallop, important attributes in a hunting dog. It is instinctively a pack dog. It is audacious, resistant, aristocratic and is very affectionate off the hunting fields. == History and use == Only three old Saintongeois hounds survived the French Revolution, two dogs and a bitch. Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour in the mid-19th century crossed the last of the old Hound of Saintonge with a few of the remaining old-type Grand Bleu de Gascogne. The hounds that were white with black ticking were retained and later given the name Gascon Saintongeois. In the middle of the 20th century, hunters in the southwest of France selected smaller dogs from litters of Grand Gascon Saintongeois for hunting hare and other small game. These became the Petit Gascon Saintongeois. The Grand Gascon Saintongeois is used for hunting big game including wild boar, roe deer and sometimes gray wolf, usually in a pack. The Petit Gascon Saintongeois is a versatile hunter, usually used on hare and rabbit, but it can also be used for big game. == See also == * Anglo- French hounds * Dog terminology == References == == External links == * Search The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Gascon Saintongeois *Petit Gascon Saintongeois in Northern Italy *Gascon Saintongeois in France Category:Dog breeds originating in France Category:FCI breeds Category:Scent hounds ","title":"Gascon Saintongeois"},{"id":"9093958","text":"Make Architects is an international architecture practice headquartered in London that also has offices in offices in Hong Kong and Sydney.

Members can participate in community service, business networking, leadership development, and social events. The Atlanta Junior Chamber is a non-profit corporation as described under IRS Code 501(C)(4). The organization was established in April 1921 by John L. Westmoreland, an Atlanta attorney, and was the first Junior Chamber in Georgia to charter and affiliate with the United States Junior Chamber (Jaycees) and is currently one of the oldest, continually active chapters in the national organization. The Atlanta Junior Chamber has played an active leadership role in the City of Atlanta and the State of Georgia for almost 90 years. The organization played a leading role in the creation of the Georgia Junior Chamber and the Florida Junior Chamber and has sponsored the establishment of numerous Junior Chambers throughout the metro area. ==Atlanta Junior Chamber mission and historyMission=== To positively impact the Atlanta community by providing young professionals opportunities for networking, community involvement and leadership advancement. ===History=== Developing the Atlanta community From its inception, the Atlanta Jaycees became concerned with almost every type of project which would serve the needs of Atlanta. The Atlanta Jaycees played a significant role in establishing Atlanta as the southern terminus of the airmail route in the eastern corridor of the United States. The eastern corridor stretched from New York to Florida. In understanding how common flying is now, we lose sight of the fact that competition in the airline industry was fierce, for it meant a new economy coming to an industry-starved section of the country. In 1926, the Atlanta Jaycees sponsored a special airmail flight between Atlanta and New York City in order to encourage the government to establish a regular air route between the two cities. The Atlanta Jaycees were also involved in organizing a group of citizens who posted beacons in the night so that pilots could see to safely fly into the city. These efforts were critical in establishing Atlanta as the southern terminus for airmail delivery and helped establish Atlanta as the premier city in the southeast.History of South Carolina Jaycees, http://www.scjaycees.org/www/pages/history.aspCORINTH INFORMATION DATABASE VERSION 1.3, Milton, Sandy, http://mlsandy.home.tsixroads.com/Corinth_MLSANDY/rt089.html In the 1970s, the Atlanta Junior Chamber recognized that the future growth of Atlanta would require an improved transportation system. With the financial and political support of Past President Clifford Oxford, the Atlanta Junior Chamber initiated a campaign to establish the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority.Georgia State University Press release: \\"Georgia State honors Atlanta lawyer for distinguished public service\\", April 9, 2001 Community service Atlanta Jaycees with 1995 ESF Honorary Chairman Bobby Cox, manager, Atlanta Braves. In 1931, the Atlanta Jaycees joined the Atlanta Georgian (a Hearst newspaper that merged with the Atlanta Journal in 1939) and fused their efforts in the Atlanta Empty Stocking Fund begun by Georgian Editor James B. Nevin in 1927. In 1939 it became the Atlanta Jaycee Journal- Constitution Empty Stocking Fund, Inc.Empty Stocking Fund: About Our Organization, The program has now become the largest of its type in the United States. In 1997, the Atlanta Jaycees and the Atlanta Journal- Constitution ceded control of the charity to a community board of directors and a professional staff in an effort to ensure that the service provided would continue to expand within the Atlanta community. At the high point of the Junior Chamber‚Äôs role in managing this charity (1994‚Äì95), the Empty Stocking Fund purchased toys for 80,000 children by raising well over $1,000,000. While ESF was the largest and best known service project, the Atlanta Jaycees did not limit programming activities to just ESF. The Atlanta Jaycees service tradition extends to actively supporting the establishment of the Hugh O'Brien Youth Leadership Foundation in Georgia, building houses through Habitat for Humanity, establishing the Bedford-Pine Boy's Club in 1968, and operating of the Summerhill Little Street Community Center.Atlanta Jaycees Annual Report - 1970 This tradition continues with chapter's dedication finding a cure for childhood cancer research through its annual support of St. Baldrick's Day. Since assuming the lead for this effort in Atlanta, the chapter has raised in excess of $175,000 for this charity over the past three years. In 2007, the chapter projects to raise over $80,000 and exceed $250,000 in total fund raised for the first four years of the project. Social justice In the 1950s the Atlanta Jaycees, under the leadership of Clifford Oxford, led a legislative drive to require the Ku Klux Klan to unmask in public. This successful legislative effort was recognized as instrumental in weakening the KKK in Georgia. As a result of these efforts, in 1953, Clifford Oxford was recognized as Atlanta's Young Man of the Year and one of Time Magazine's 100 Leaders of Tomorrow.Dudley, JW: \\"\\"Hate\\" Organizations of the 1940s \\", pp. 262-274. Phylon 1981 The 1960s saw a continuation of the Atlanta Jaycees civil rights involvement with the desegregation of the chapter in 1966-67 under the leadership of Ivan Allen III. The chapter demonstrated its commitment to desegregation at the local and state level by seating African-American chapter members as delegates to the Annual Meeting of the Georgia Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1967.109 CONG. REC. A4438 (daily ed. July 16, 1963) (appendix of statement of Atlanta Junior Chamber of Commerce) In 1977-78, the chapter voted to implement a pilot plan adopted by the U.S. Jaycees under which young women were permitted to join. Atlanta was the only chapter in Georgia allowed to participate in the pilot project, and this involvement eventually led to the inclusion of women in Junior Chambers nationwide. These efforts were quite controversial in Georgia and resulted in an unsuccessful attempt to revoke the Junior Chamber charter from the Atlanta chapter. In response to these attacks, the chapter established a separate corporate identify, the Atlanta Junior Association of Commerce and Industry, Inc., in 1979.Georgia Secretary of State, Control Number: H900539, http://corp.sos.state.ga.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?576134 While the admission of women into the Jaycees was resolved in 1984 following the Supreme Court's decision in Roberts v.

United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0468_0609_ZS.html the chapter maintained this alternate corporate identity for an additional 5-year period to ensure that the issue was completely resolved nationally. National and international meetings NOM President's Reception Hosted by Atlanta at JCI Area C Meeting in Panama - 1999. In 1955, the Atlanta Jaycees hosted its first US Junior Chamber National Convention. The Atlanta Jaycees helped convince the rest of the United States that Atlanta is a great convention city. The success of the 1955 meeting laid the groundwork for the US Jaycees to return to Atlanta in 1961, 1972, and again in 1984. The 1972 convention is remembered by the U.S. Jaycees as the first time over 12,000 Jaycees attended a national convention. The 1984 convention represented another significant milestone in the history of the Junior Chamber in that this convention was the first to officially admit women as full members of the organization. The Atlanta Junior Chamber‚Äôs role in uniting young leaders from around the country was expanded in 1999 when the chapter was named the host city for the Junior Chamber International's Area C Conference in 2001. This conference, the largest Area C meeting to date, brought 750 Jaycees from 40 countries together in Atlanta. The tradition of bringing young leaders together will continue in 2007 when the chapter hosts the US Junior Chamber Met-Net conference, a meeting designed for Junior Chambers in metro communities around the world. Recent history Georgia Jaycees recognize Atlanta as top chapter - 1994. The chapter programming during the 1990s focused primarily on fundraising, membership and the Empty Stocking Fund. In 1994, the chapter reached a modern-day high point for membership with 380 members and was recognized as the top chapter in the Georgia Jaycee organization. The strength of the chapter's leadership training was demonstrated in 1993 when Tricia (Evert) Welsh was elected Georgia Jaycee State President - the 5th Atlanta Jaycee to hold that office and the first since 1981. In 1994, Tricia was elected US Junior Chamber National Vice President - only the 2nd Atlanta Jaycee to hold this office. The 1994 year represented high-water marks for chapter and charitable fundraising efforts with members raising over $30,000 for the chapter and in excess of $1 million for local charities. In addition to these achievements, the role of women and minorities continued to expand within the chapter - a reflection of the growing diversity within the Atlanta community. Since 1990, the chapter has elected 7 women as Local President - representing a 3 fold increase in the number of female local presidents since the chapter was founded in 1921. While impressive, the true impact of female leadership was seen at the board level where the majority of officers and directors leading the chapter have been women. Further, as the Atlanta population diversified so did the chapter membership. This increasing chapter diversity was bolstered by the election of the chapter's first Vietnamese-American local president in 1995 and the chapter‚Äôs for first Peruvian-American local president in 2002. Atlanta also hosted the Junior Chamber International‚Äôs Area C meeting and has taken a more active role in leading the US Junior Chamber with individual members serving as the National Legal Counsel and Southeast Metro Area Director in 2006 and 2007 respectively. ===The chapter today=== Past President Phil and Past President Mike leading the St. Baldrick's Day event. Under the leadership of Adrian Marshall, the chapter continues to provide the community of Atlanta with leadership training through community service. The signature community event for the chapter is the annual St. Baldrick's Day fundraiser that raises money to support childhood cancer research. Leading the fundraising efforts in Atlanta, the chapter has raised in excess of $500,000 for this charity since 2003. In 2012, under the leadership of Gary Marshall, the chapter finished number one in the nation for membership growth, growing by 234%. The state of Georgia also finished as the number one state in the nation in 2012. In 2012, the Atlanta Jaycees were honored to have member Jessica Black named as one of the JCI's 2012 Ten Outstanding Young Americans (TOYA). Every year the U.S. Junior Chamber dedicates an evening at the annual meeting to celebrate several top outstanding young Americans. These individuals exemplify the organization‚Äôs mission: to provide development opportunities that empower young people to create positive change. These honorees have taken initiative to address needs in their communities and around the world. However, they did not stop there, pushing onward from initial success onto bigger impact. They show the power of young people to create positive change. Noted past recipients of this award include Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Orson Welles and Christopher Reed. The chapter today has approximately 100 members representing a wide variety of educational and professional interests. Members continue to build on its 90+ years of service to the Atlanta community by providing young professionals the opportunity to participate in community service, business networking, leadership development, educational advancement and social events. The chapter's focus remains on its local members and leadership development as it strives to support the legacy established by former members, including the late Senator Paul Coverdell and the late Mayor Maynard Jackson. ===Current chapter leadership=== *Jordan Suresky ‚Äì President *Michelle Kim ‚Äì Chairman of the Board / immediate past president *Michelle Kim ‚Äì Executive Vice President *' ‚Äì Marketing *Chelsea Yearous - Events VP *Jordan Suresky - International Relations *Megan Harrison ‚Äì Treasurer ==Junior Chamber creed== The original handwritten Jaycee Creed.

It took nearly nine years for him to achieve sekitori status by gaining promotion to the second j≈´ry≈ç division in January 2002. However, it took him only two further tournaments to reach the top makuuchi division. On his debut outing in makuuchi in May 2002 he made an immediate impression, finishing as runner-up with a strong 11-4 record and the fighting spirit prize. He was also a runner-up in the March 2003 tournament. The highlight of Hokut≈çriki's career came in May 2004, the only occasion when he recorded a winning score from the upper maegashira ranks. Ranked at maegashira 1, he sensationally defeated Asash≈çry≈´ on the sixth day - his first ever victory over a yokozuna. Asash≈çry≈´ had won the previous two tournaments with unbeaten 15-0 records and was on a 35 bout winning streak. With Asash≈çry≈´ suffering another defeat to Kyokutenh≈ç on Day 11, Hokut≈çriki came into the final day the sole leader on 13-1, his only defeat in the tournament thus far being to Wakanosato on Day 8. However, he lost his senshuraku bout to Hakuh≈ç, then in his debut top division tournament, being sidestepped by the 19-year-old after two false starts. With Asash≈çry≈´ defeating Chiyotaikai, both Asash≈çry≈´ and Hokut≈çriki were tied on 13-2 and had to meet again in a playoff for the championship, which Hokut≈çriki lost. Nevertheless, he was rewarded with special prizes for Fighting spirit and Outstanding Performance, and after the tournament he was promoted to sumo's third highest rank of sekiwake. Hokut≈çriki in May 2009 Hokut≈çriki managed only a 3-12 record in his sekiwake debut and never managed a return to the san'yaku ranks, instead bouncing up and down the maegashira ranks. He is one of the few wrestlers (along with Kotetsuyama and Hayateumi) whose only tournament in san'yaku was at sekiwake rather than komusubi. He won another Fighting Spirit Award for his twelve wins from maegashira 11 in January 2006, but in November of that year he pulled out of the tournament on the ninth day with no wins at all and was relegated to the j≈´ry≈ç division. However, a 9-6 record at j≈´ry≈ç 4 in March 2007 was good enough to earn promotion back to the top division for the May 2007 tournament. Although he remained in makuuchi he did not manage to defeat a yokozuna again and had several disastrous openings to tournaments, going 0-10 in July 2008 from maegashira 2 and 0-12 in March 2009 from maegashira 1. In May 2009 another poor record of 4-11 saw him demoted to j≈´ry≈ç for the second time. However, an 11-4 score there returned him immediately to the top division. He withdrew from the September 2010 tournament on the 13th day after suffering a neck injury, which also kept him out of the following tournament in November. Falling to the bottom of the j≈´ry≈ç division, he was unable to enter the January 2011 basho as well. ==Retirement from sumo== Hokutoriki did not enter the May 2011 technical examination tournament, at which he had fallen to the rank of makushita 13, and announced his retirement on Day 7. He remained in sumo as a coach at Hakkaku stable under the toshiyori or elder name of Tanigawa-oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki or retirement ceremony was held in May 2012. In June 2018 he transferred to Kokonoe stable. == Fighting style == Hokut≈çriki relied almost exclusively on pushing and slapping techniques, with over a third of his wins coming by oshidashi, or push-out. He was usually defeated if his opponents managed to grab hold of his mawashi or belt. He often used henka, or sidestepping, to wrong-foot his opponents, and was adept at pull-downs and slap-downs. However, in the January 2008 tournament he was himself a victim of the henka tactic on three consecutive days, slipping from a score of 6-5 to 6-8. ==Family== Hokut≈çriki is married, and his first child, a daughter, was born in December 2007. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo elders *List of sekiwake ==ReferencesHokutoriki's basho results Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Tochigi Prefecture Category:Sekiwake Category:Kokonoe stable sumo wrestlers ","title":"Hokut≈çriki Hideki"},{"id":"9094078","text":"Mario Sergio may refer to: *M√°rio S√©rgio (born 1981), Portuguese footballer *Mario Sergio (politician) (born 1940), Canadian politician *M√°rio S√©rgio Pontes de Paiva (1950‚Äì2016), Brazilian former footballer *M√°rio S√©rgio Aumarante Santana (born 1977), Brazilian footballer * (born 1983), Colombian footballer ","title":"Mario Sergio"},{"id":"9094085","text":"Persian Trilogy is a set of three orchestral works composed by Iranian classical musician, Behzad Ranjbaran.

The book consists of the four chapters from the original essay along with a new essay written by Moore in 2003 reflecting on his earlier advice.

The final chapter, however, was written in 2003; it aims to provide a writing for comics course and advises the writer \\"never to get stuck in one writing style, always be open to try new things\\". These chapters are: *Chapter 1 ‚Äì The Basic Idea: Thinking About Comics: this focuses on the idea behind the whole work of art, and what the writer intends to express in his or her work. *Chapter 2 ‚Äì Reaching The Reader: Structure, Pacing, Story Telling: this examines what is going on in the reader's mind and gives tips on how to keep the reader focused on the comic book. *Chapter 3 ‚Äì World Building: Place and Personality: the text suggests to possible comic book writers that they examine real-life characters, people they know throughout their life, in order to create realistic fictional characters. This chapter also gives hints about how to create a detailed universe, even if it means that the writer starts by creating economic structures. *Chapter 4 ‚Äì The Details: Plot and Script: this chapter aims to demolish the misunderstanding of the importance of plot. Moore delineates plot not as a list of things happening but more like a concept of time, contributing to the other elements of the art. *Final Part ‚Äì Afterwords: this subsequent addition to the original essay sums up and is a confession of all the wrong things Alan Moore told the readers eighteen years earlier in the first four chapters about how they could become a good writer.

It is one of the Anglo-French hound breeds which were created by crossing French scenthounds with English (Anglo) Foxhounds. == Appearance == A typical hound in general appearance, with long legs, long drop ears, and a long tail. Their short, double coat is tricolour, black, white and tan. They stand 60‚Äì72 cm (24‚Äì28 in) at the withers and weigh between 34.5-35.5 kg (76-78 lbs). == History and use == The Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore is descended from crosses between tricoloured Poitevins and Foxhounds. This combination has strongly influenced this breed in many ways. These animals are strong and compact in stature like the foxhound with a black blanketed tri- colour coat. They were used as a pack dog to hunt large game such as red deer, wild boar and roe deer or smaller animals such as fox. \\"Grand\\" does not necessarily refer to size, \\"in most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game\\". The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club)Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine, Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore and internationally in 1983 by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in Group 6, Scenthounds. In France it is bred and kept primarily as a hunting dog, not as a pet or showdog. The breed has been exported to North America, where it is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. It is also registered by numerous minor registries and internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet. ==Health and temperament== This large Anglo-French hound requires an immense amount of exercise. They are normally kept in large packs in rural areas and may not adapt well to city or family life, although they are said to be good natured. Letting them off the lead may be hazardous as the hunting instinct is very high. == Tricolour == A tricolour coat is a pattern of some shade of black or brown, some shade of red often called tan, and some white. Eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigmentation occurs on the same dog; \\"the back is black from eumelanin pigment being made and the belly is tan or red from phaeomelanin pigment being made\\".Tricolour genetics == See also == * Anglo-French hounds * Dog terminology == References == == External links == * Pack of French hounds in a hunting magazine * Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hounds in a French magazine * Search DMOZ links for clubs and information about the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore Category:Dog breeds originating in France Category:FCI breeds Category:Scent hounds ","title":"Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore"},{"id":"9094366","text":"Underwater volcano may refer to: *Subaqueous volcano, a volcano that forms under a lake *Submarine volcano, a volcano that forms under an ocean ==See also== * Subglacial volcano ","title":"Underwater volcano"},{"id":"9094381","text":"Neo-pop (also known as New Pop) is a postmodern artFred S.

It also sought to publicize and encourage the missionary enterprise in general. Arthur Tappan Pierson was the primary early leader. ==Origins and consolidation 1886‚Äì1891== Memorial plaque for the origin of the Student Volunteer Movement, July 1886, Northfield Mount Hermon School Conference memorial Arthur Tappan Pierson founder of SVM The social and religious milieu of the late nineteenth century was favorable in nearly all ways for the birth and growth of a movement such as the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. It was a time of dominance and prestige for Western civilization. Imperialistic expansion was condoned as an altruistic response to increased knowledge of the non-Western world. The rising nationalism of the era provided important motivation for the foreign missionary enterprise, for the success of American civilization was attributed to its Christian basis. Protestant foreign missionaries were heroes and heroines for the American public; and, as Robert Handy has noted, \\"Though they strove as Christians to keep the priority on spiritual religion and to be aware of the difference between faith and culture, it was not difficult in the spirit of those times to lose the distinction and to see Christian civilization as a main outcome of faith, if not its chief outcome.\\"Robert T. Handy, A Christian America; Protestant Hopes and Historical Realities, New York: Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 140. Historian of Christianity Kenneth Scott Latourette's comment that \\"one of the distinctive tokens of the Christianity and especially of the Protestantism of the United States was the fashion in which it conformed to the ethos of the country\\", was surely borne out in the early days of the Student Volunteer Movement.Kenneth Scott Latourette quoted in Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People,New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972, pp. 858‚Äì859. The spirit of pre- War American culture was one of expansionism and activism with an orientation toward business and enterprise. The extensive financial records and correspondence of the Volunteer Movement illustrate a congruence in style between business enterprise and the missions enterprise. American culture's shift toward scientific positivism during this era was reflected in the Student Volunteer Movement's emphasis on elaborate statistical evidence of its work. Practical aspects of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also contributed to the rapid growth of Protestant missions. Travel to far corners of the earth was possible as never before because of improved transportation and communication. The world scene was largely free from wars. It was a time of increasing Protestant wealth; Christian tycoons under attack for their enormous profits were more than happy to contribute large sums for the support of the foreign missionary enterprise. With a perspective sharpened by knowledge of post-War events, historians of American religion have pointed to underlying conflicts and discrepancies which belied the idealistic confidence of the pre-War era. Economic turmoil, urbanization, the rise of historical criticism and evolutionary theory, the issue of liberalism versus revivalism‚Äîall these potentially disruptive elements lay beneath the assured facade of pre-War American Protestantism. Sydney Ahlstrom has attributed the foreign missions boom of the era to the churches' desire to avoid confrontation on these issues: \\"crusades of diverse sorts were organized, in part, it would seem, to heal or hide the disunity of the churches.\\"Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972, p. 733. Robert Handy has seen the mission enterprise as an extension of the voluntaryism of the 1830s‚Äîa means for cooperative Protestant action in society without confrontation on particular denominational differences. Handy, like Ahlstrom, has pointed to the dangers which were inherent in sublimation of theological and social controversy under activist crusades: \\"The possibility of a greater sense of self-criticism, which might have come out of a more open confrontation of the parties, was largely suppressed, in considerable measure because of the necessities of the missionary consensus. .Handy, p. 134 This, then, was the milieu into which the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions was born in July 1886. Its emergence at a summer student conference held on the campus of the Mount Hermon School in Northfield, Massachusetts had all the drama of a theatrical play, and its story was told countless times over the decades of the Movement's existence. The drama of the scene will not be destroyed, however, by consideration of the historical antecedents of the Movement. In his work, Two Centuries of Student Christian Movements, Clarence Shedd traced the existence of student Christian societies back to the early years of the eighteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, he found, a foreign missions emphasis was prevalent in the student societies and fully three-quarters of them were called Societies of Missionary Inquiry.Clarence P. Shedd, Two Centuries of Student Christian Movements, New York: Association Press, 1934, p. xviii. In 1877, a student department of YMCA was formed to direct efforts more specifically toward Christian work on college and university campuses. Luther D. Wishard, the first collegiate secretary of the YMCA, had a great personal interest in foreign missions, and his influence did much to orient the student YMCA in that direction. On the theological seminary scene, efforts were underway by 1879 to form \\"some permanent system of inter- seminary correspondence on the subject of missions.\\"Clarence P. Shedd, Two Centuries of Student Christian Movements, New York: Association Press, 1934, p. 214. To this end, the Inter-Seminary Missionary Alliance was established in 1880 and had annual conventions until 1898 when its work was merged with that of the Student Volunteer Movement and intercollegiate YMCA. The first, unofficial, group of student volunteers for foreign missions was formed in 1888 at Princeton College. Five students, including Robert P. Wilder, drew up and signed a declaration of purpose which read, \\"We, the undersigned, declare ourselves willing and desirous, God permitting, to go to the unevangelized portions of the world.\\"Robert P. Wilder, The Great Commission: The Missionary Response to the Student Volunteer Movements in North America and Europe, London: Oliphants Ltd., 1936, p. 13\\\\. Material related to the Princeton band is also found in the SVM archives, particularly in Series V, Organization and Policy Records. Calling themselves the Princeton Foreign Missionary Society, these students met regularly on Sunday afternoons at the home of Robert Wilder's father who was a former missionary to India and currently editor of The Missionary Review. In 1885, Luther Wishard discussed with evangelist Dwight L. Moody the possibility of holding a Bible study conference for undergraduate students, sponsored by the intercollegiate YMCA, on the grounds of the Moody-backed Mount Hermon School. Moody agreed to the proposal, and in July 1886 two hundred and fifty-one students from eighty-nine colleges and universities met together for nearly a month. Although Robert Wilder had graduated from Princeton in 1885, and was no longer an undergraduate student, Luther Wishard, knowing of Wilder's missionary interests, specifically invited him to the Northfield conference. The Northfield conference was designed to provide for Bible study, evangelistic addresses, and discussion of methods for YMCA college work. Although several of the 251 delegates had come to Northfield already committed to a missionary vocation, missions were scarcely mentioned from the platform during the first two weeks of the conference. Those interested in missions met daily for prayer, led by Robert Wilder, and spread their concern for missions by word of mouth among the delegates. Two missionary addresses were given outside of the conferences formal program, the first by Arthur Tappan Pierson and the second by William Ashmore, an American Baptist missionary to China. Twenty-five years later John R. Mott waxed eloquent in reminiscing about the impact of Dr. Ashmore's address on the students at Northfield: He knew how to get hold of college men. I will tell you the way to do it, and that is to place something before them which is tremendously difficult. He presented missions as a war of conquest and not as a mere wrecking expedition. It appealed to the strong college athletes and other fine spirits of the colleges because of its difficulty. They wanted to hear more about it. The number of interviews greatly multiplied.John R. Mott, \\"The Beginnings of the Student Volunteer Movement\\" in The Student Volunteer Movement After Twenty-Five Years, pp. 12‚Äì13. Information about the Northfield meeting is also available in the Springfield Republican, August 2, 1886. The underground swell of missionary enthusiasm grew daily, and at last the subject of missions was introduced on the formal platform of the conference in the form of a \\"meeting of ten nations\\". Ten men, some foreign students and others missionary sons, were found to speak of the mission needs of the lands of their birth. Those who listened were deeply impressed, and by the last day of the Northfield conference ninety-nine students had signed a paper which read: \\"We are willing and desirous, God permitting, to become foreign missionaries.\\" The morning after the closing of the conference the ninety-nine volunteers met for a farewell service, and while they prayed one more came in to join their ranks. In the succeeding days it was decided to form a deputation of volunteers to visit colleges across North America in an attempt to extend the influences of the Northfield missionary uprising. The model for this deputation was the \\"Cambridge Seven\\", a group of prominent British university students who had decided to become missionaries to China following the evangelistic crusade of Dwight Moody at Cambridge University in 1884. Members of the \\"Cambridge Seven\\" traveling throughout Britain and the United States had had considerable impact on various campuses. The four volunteers chosen to form the Northfield deputation were Robert Wilder, John R. Mott, William P. Taylor, and L. Riley of Princeton, Cornell, DePauw, and Yale. The original scheme was that these four would not only speak about missions but would also form a Quartet and sing mission songs. The deputation fell apart before it got started, however, as, within the next two months, Mott, Riley and Taylor decided that it was not God's will for them to travel during the next academic year. Worried letters were exchanged between Robert Wilder and the two YMCA intercollegiate secretaries ‚Äì - Luther Wishard and Charles K. Ober. It was feared that the momentum of Northfield would be lost due to the recalcitrance of the three who had pulled out. Wishard wrote to Ober on August 19, 1886 regarding Mott's withdrawal: \\"The tone of his letter did not suit me. He seemed disposed to see the Lord's hand in his detention without indicating a single reason aside from his parents' opposition for not going. I told him the fact of God's interest in the enterprise did not absolutely insure success as his letter would imply.Letter of Luther Wishard to C.K. Ober in John R. Mott Papers, Yale Divinity School Library Record Group No. 45. Sources of information for the early months of the Volunteer Movement are the correspondence of Wishard, Mott, Wilder and Ober, as well as printed historical pamphlets produced by the SVM. At last the problem was solved as John Forman, who had not been at Northfield but was one of the original five volunteers at Princeton, to accompany Wilder on his tour of North American college and university campuses during the academic year 1886‚Äì1887. One hundred and sixty-seven institutions were visited, and by the end of the year 2200 young men and women had declared their purpose to become foreign missionaries. In later years the work of Wilder and Forman was severely criticized for its highly pressured emotionalism. The Catholic periodical America published a description of early volunteer recruitment which undoubtedly had some basis in fact: The manner in which these young People were won over is remarkably American. According to Warneck, even moral violence was used. Three, four, five meetings were held in succession, the one more emotional than the other. At some of them even the lights were extinguished, while all lay prostrate upon the floor in prayer. More and more urgent appeals were addressed to the young men, then already in a state of great excitement, until finally, one, two, then three and more, of the artfully intoxicated students volunteered.\\"Mission Movement Among Protestant Students,\\" America, December 5, 1914, p. 192\\\\. Other comments regarding SVM methods are available in newspaper and magazine clippings which were saved in the Movement archives. During the academic year 1887/1888 there were no deputations to campuses, as Wilder and Forman chose to commence their theological training. The earlier visits had continuing impact, however, as local bands of volunteers were formed and six hundred further declarations of purpose were received. The offices of the volunteer movement during these earliest years were the dormitory room of William Hannum, a student at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. As Wilder and others visited campuses and churches and obtained names and addresses of students who wished to volunteer, Hannum made lists of volunteers and attempted to correspond with them. The records of volunteers were kept in envelopes in boxes under Hannum's bed. As they proliferated, Hannum called upon his fellow students for help. He later wrote \\"I almost felt that my demands for help were a hazard to my popularity. One classmate asserted that when I got to Heaven I should be making lists of the angels.\\"This quote and other details about the early years are in Wilder, p. 39 ff. By July 1888, at YMCA student conference at Northfield, it seemed clear to interested parties that the student missionary thrust needed some organization. Much of the original zeal had subsided, and \\"where it still survived it displayed itself in new organizations, tending to separate from the existing religious societies of the colleges and sometimes at discordance with them. (Robert E. Speer, \\"The Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement\\".The Sunday School Times, February 27, 1892.) The travels of Wilder and Forman had been completely financed by D.W. McWilliams, secretary and treasurer of the Manhattan Elevated Railways Co., but it was clear that the movement needed a broader financial base in order to continue. In the summer of 1888 the volunteer movement adopted as its official name the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions and took as its slogan or watchword \\"the evangelization of the world in this generation.\\" Questions regarding the relation of the student volunteers to existing student Christian groups, particularly YMCA and YWCA, had been in the air since the fall of 1886. On September 7, 1886 Luther Wishard had written to C.K. Ober regarding the nascent volunteer movement: \\"It will not do to have a distinct organization for this purpose. Colleges are becoming overrun with organizations now.\\"Letter of Luther Wishard to C.K. Ober in John R. Mott Papers It was clear that the general aims of the Volunteer Movement were in agreement with those of YMCA but the SVM had a wider constituency, including women and graduate students, as well as a more specialized focus. In August 1888, when plans were made for Robert Wilder to again tour the North American campuses for the SVM, Luther Wishard expressed reservations to a fellow YMCA secretary: \\"Unless Wilder is perfectly willing to cooperate with our views concerning the connection of the missionary with the regular association work, I am seriously disposed to deflect his course into another channel. You know that we had little or no influence over him year before last. He talked Mission Band all year and never to my knowledge did he try to retain the work in the Association and never did he try to aid any other department of the Association work. As a result of his method the College Associations are conducting fewer missionary meetings.\\"Letter of Luther Wishard, August 6, 1886. Wishard, Wilder, Mott, and other leaders of the volunteer movement sought a solution to this conflict of interests in early 1889 proposing that the Student Volunteer Movement be designated as the official missionary arm of YMCA and YWCA. They formed an Executive Committee of the Movement with one representative each from YMCA, the YWCA and the Inter-Seminary Missionary Alliance. A traveling secretary, a recording secretary and a corresponding secretary were appointed to carry on the daily work of the Movement. They concentrated their efforts on spreading missionary enthusiasm and bringing local and state volunteer organizations under the influence of the national Movement. The work of the early years culminated in the First International (i.e., including Canada) Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement, meeting in Cleveland in 1891. This convention, with its keynote The evangelization of the world in this generation\\", was the largest student conference assembled to its time. The Executive Committee reported to the convention that 6,200 volunteers in 350 institutions had been enrolled and 320 had actually sailed to foreign fields under appointment of various mission boards. At Cleveland, the relationship of the SVM to the Protestant foreign missions boards was clarified to the effect that the Movement was in no way a sending agency but rather viewed itself as a recruiting agency for the boards. Thus, by 1891, the Student Volunteer Movement was on firm footing and appeared to have found a clear space for operating in the American religious scene. Its relation to other established student Christian movements was that of an autonomous but associated agency with the clearly defined objectives of foreign mission education and recruitment. As a missionary organization, the Movement was assured a place within American Protestantism, for, as missions historian Charles Forman has written, \\"In the new enthusiasm following 1890 mission work was seen by its interpreters as the essential work of the church; no church could be healthy without it.\\"Charles Forman, \\"A History of Foreign Mission Theory in America,\\" American Missions in Bicentennial Perspective, ed. R. Pierce Beaver South Pasadena, Cal: William Carey Library, 1977, p. 83. ==Continued growth== The years of steady growth following 1891 were not without their problems. In its report to the Second International Convention, held in Detroit in 1894, the Executive Committee pointed to five \\"problems\\" and five \\"perils\\" for the Student Volunteer Movement. The problems were: 1) lack of supervision and control over local volunteer bands, 2) inability to keep in touch with isolated volunteers, particularly those who had graduated but had not yet sailed, 3) difficulty in holding volunteers after they had entered theological seminary; \\"from the beginning to the end of the course the whole presumption in the teaching and attitude of the faculty is that the men are all going to stay home\\"Student Volunteer Movement Archives,Series V, Executive Committee report, 1894, p. 6\\\\. Much of the material in this section derives from the Executive Committee reports contained in Series V. 4) difficulties in connecting volunteers up with mission societies and 5) financial obstacles. by 1894, 630 volunteers had sailed but others had been held back because the mission societies did not have sufficient funds to send them. The Executive Committee cited two \\"perils\\" which related to the Student Volunteer Movement declaration of purpose card, a 3\\" by 5\\" card which a volunteer signed to indicate his or her intention to become a foreign missionary. In the summer of 1892, the original phrase for referring to these cards, the \\"volunteer pledge\\", had been replaced by the phrase \\"volunteer declaration\\". The wording of the card had been changed to read: \\"It is my purpose, if God permit, to become a foreign missionary.\\" These changes were made to counter the criticism that the card was a binding pledge which caused the volunteer to take his life into his own control rather than relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Charges of pressured emotionalism led to the Executive Committees caution that the declaration card not be used at the wrong time, in the wrong place or under wrong circumstances. The Executive Committee had included in its 1891 report statistics to counter the particular charge that students were being pressured at so young an age that they could not make competent decisions. Only 14 percent of enrolled volunteers at that time were under twenty years of age. A third peril seen by the Executive Committee in 1894 was that of exaggerating the results of the Movement. Thousands had signed the SVM declaration card but then had no continued contact with the Movement. The Executive Committee decided not to count as members of the Movement those of whom it could obtain no trace. By this policy, the official membership of the Movement was cut drastically from a supposed 6200 volunteers in 1891 to 3200 volunteers in 1894. A fourth peril concerned the growing class of volunteers classified as \\"hindered\\", those who had signed the declaration of purpose but now showed little likelihood of making it to the foreign field because of health, family or financial reasons. The fifth peril brought to the attention of the Convention by the Executive Committee was one which proved to be a nemesis for the SVM throughout its existence. There was a tendency for a breach to form between student volunteers and religiously oriented non-volunteers on college campuses. The volunteers were accused of taking on a tone of superiority and segregating themselves from the general religious associations. Nearly a decade later, Robert Speer again reported to the Executive Committee: \\"I have found an apparent chasm between the volunteers and the rest of the students in the institution. The Volunteer Band is a little circle cut off from the students and often without a bond of sympathy between it and the students.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Executive Committee meeting 1903 Jan. 14. The Student Volunteer Movement's early method of presenting the missionary cause through \\"fact meetings\\", statistical presentations of the needs of various fields, gave way during this period to missions study classes. An Educational Department was formed in 1894, and introduced its first four courses of study: \\"The Historical Development of the Missionary Idea\\", \\"South America\\", \\"Medical Missions\\", and \\"China as a Mission Field.\\" Increasing emphasis was placed on forming missionary libraries on campuses.Correspondence between Harlan P. Beach and John R. Mott in Series III is the best source for information about the early educational work of the SVM. During the early years of the Movement emphasis had been placed on recruiting young men as volunteers. The traveling secretaries were men, and they had not generally visited women's institutions. The proportion of women accessible in colleges was also much smaller than the proportion of men. By 1892, seventy percent of declared volunteers were men and thirty percent were women although in the general American missionary movement women outnumbered men. In 1895, steps were taken to rectify this situation, including increased visitation of women's colleges. No major rival movements had as yet arisen to compete for the student religious territory claimed by the SVM although potential rivals apparently existed, as mentioned in the correspondence of 1895: I do not fear anything of much account from the 'Order of the Double Cross' which originated with Dr. Dowkontt. It cannot hold its constituency together even were it to become fairly organized on any considerable scale. It will doubtless soon die out as other side movements have. At its very best it would not be of much power or a serious menace to our work. Still it is well to keep a watch on it and this we shall constantly do.SVM Archives, Series III, H.B. Sharman to J.R. Mott, December 9, 1895. Later, at a 1904 leaders' conference, a word of caution was again raised; \\"We must remember an undertone that the Student Volunteer Movement has a monopoly and there is talk of a new movement.SVM Archives, Series V. The initial fervor of the Student Volunteer Movement cause had swept aside questions regarding specific theological stances but as the Movement became more deeply involved in missionary education work, criticisms inevitably arose. Educational Secretary Harlan P. Beach wrote to John R. Mott in June 1896 regarding criticisms of the Movement's course of study dealing with non-Christian religions. The views of the author, it was charged, were \\"tinctured with the Parliament of Religions flavor\\" but Beach maintained that they were not nearly so liberal as that.SVM Archives, Series III, H.P. Beach to J.R. Mott, June 23, 1896. In the view of the Volunteer Movement leaders, the entire Protestant missions enterprise seemed to be sagging in the last years of the nineteenth century. Harlan Beach wrote to Mott in 1896: \\"Sometimes it seems as if the missionary spirit of the churches had received a permanent setback. The panic is far enough in the background now to have lost its power. No immediate prospect of better times is to be seen. What then can be done?\\"SVM Archives, Series III, H.P. Beach to J.R. Mott, February 9, 1896. Increasingly, the Movement's task was not only to recruit missionaries but also, through educational methods, to encourage financial support of the mission boards. There were far more recruits than positions to be filled but the SVM justified its continued recruiting activity on the grounds that a wider pool for the boards to select from would result in more highly qualified missionaries. Despite these negative notes, the Student Volunteer Movement grew steadily during the pre-War era. Regular Quadrennial Conventions were held in 1898 (Cleveland), 1902 (Toronto), 1906 (Nashville), 1910 (Rochester) and 1914 (Kansas City). Convention speakers included such prominent individuals as former Secretary of State John W. Foster, Ambassador of Great Britain in the United States Henry Mortimer Durand and James Bryce. By 1910, 4338 volunteers had sailed to foreign fields. Slightly over fifty percent of all missionaries who sailed from America in the years 1906 to 1909 were student volunteers.See particularly reports to the Quadrennial Conventions, Series VIII, and the material of Series V for information regarding the progress and problems of the Movement. The activities of the SVM also had spinoff effects including the formation of the Laymen's Missionary Movement in 1906 and the establishment of home mission projects such as the Yale Hope Mission. The identification of the work of the Volunteer Movement with the ethos of American society during this period was expressed clearly by the religious periodical The Outlook in its comments on the 1906 Nashville convention: The confidence which, directed to one end, gives security to commerce was at Nashville a faith in the ultimate worldwide prevalence of the influence and principles of Christ. Ambition, which drives some men into constructing great industries, was there the impulse to have a part in bringing that dominion to pass; and devotion to a purpose, which is the secret of success in commercial enterprise, was there manifest in the determination of those four thousand delegates thus expressed to make known to all the world \\"in this generation\\" the Good News.\\"A Sign of American Idealism,\\" The Outlook, March 31, 1906, p. 734. ==Facing a new era== The First World War led to a drop in recruitment of new volunteers, but the months immediately following the armistice brought a phenomenal increase in new missionaries sent overseas. The peak year for enlistment of new volunteers was 1921. The high idealism of the war years still reigned, and mission work seemed to fit clearly with hopeful expectations for international democracy. The Interchurch World Movement symbolized the crusading idealism of the times with its aim of gathering all American benevolent and missionary societies into a grand campaign for the spread of Christianity. The devastating collapse of the Interchurch World Movement due to lack of financial support shocked American Protestant leaders into the realization that a new era had arrived. With the \\"return to normalcy\\", post-War economic disruption and an altered psychological mood, there was a rapid descent into what Robert Handy has called the \\"American religious depression\\" of 1925 to 1935. This religious depression, in force well before the great economic depression of the era, was grounded in the realization that American Protestantism could no longer identify itself with American culture and civilization.Robert T. Handy, The American Religious Depression 1925‚Äì1935, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1968. The fortunes of the Student Volunteer Movement during this period provide vivid illustration of the general trends in American Protestantism. Even while missionary enthusiasm was peaking and declaration cards were pouring in, winds of dissent were buffeting the Des Moines convention of 1919/1920. As Robert Handy has described the scene, the patriarch of the Movement, John R. Mott, opened the convention with an address similar in tone to those of previous conventions. When Sherwood Eddy took the same tack, some of the students disclosed their feelings to him frankly, saying \\"why do you bring us this piffle, these old shibboleths, these old worn-out phrases, why are you talking to us about the living God and the divine Christ?\\" Eddy thereupon threw aside his prepared second address and spoke instead in support of the League of Nations and social reform, before returning again to spiritual reform.Handy, A Christian America, p. 193. The old Student Volunteer Movement evangelicalism no longer had the same appeal for the post-War generation of students. Proof seemed forthcoming that the surging missionary enterprise of American Protestantism's halcyon days had been in part a shield against potential controversy. When its momentum broke, several major problems arose for the Student Volunteer Movement and refused to be subdued. The overarching difficulty was that of a widening conservative/ liberal rift whose roots extending back to the founding of the Volunteer Movement. The early focus of debate had been the Movement's watchword, \\"the evangelization of the world in this generation.\\" Arthur T. Pierson, who had first used the watchword at Northfield, was a renowned conservative premillenarianist. The impression became widespread that the watchword implied a rapid, simplistic, verbal presentation of Christ to the world which would fulfill the Biblical command and bring about the Second Coming. Though Pierson himself denied this meaning and other SVM leaders, such as Mott and Speer, repeatedly urged a broader interpretation which involved church planting and educational work, the watchword remained a center of controversy. For the missionary enterprise, the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy was framed in terms of the relative merits of an emphasis on individual evangelism and salvation or a broader, social impact on foreign culture based on the tenets of Christianity. Sherwood Eddy wrote in July 1922 to the Executive Committee:\\"I believe that the demand of the progressive students at Des Moines voiced the new sentiment in the colleges for a more socialized and broader presentation and conduct of our whole movement ... . The next Convention might well spend several days in making indelibly clear the Pagan racial practice both at home and abroad, the Pagan industrial situation here and in other lands, Pagan nationalism at home and abroad, and against such a background make clear the vital need for Christ's teachings and for Christ's power if the world is to be Christianized. The growing skepticism, even pessimism, about Western civilization led American students to view foreign missions and home missions as equally important parts of the same task. It seemed clear that American society was as much in need of Christianizing as many non-Western societies. At the same time non-Western countries were beginning to doubt whether anything of value could be derived from a civilization capable of producing the horrors of World War I. Rising nationalism abroad brought distrust of the motives and methods of foreign missionaries. These broad changes led to a distinct shift in Protestant mission theory. At first evangelization of the world had meant exportation of a Christian Western civilization. Now that Western civilization was questioned and viewed as itself un-Christian, there was increased appreciation for non-Western cultures and a conviction that Western missionary activity should find its role in support, not control, of the emerging indigenous churches. The new rationale for missionary activity was one which Charles Forman has called \\"ecumenical sharing.\\"Forman, p. 98 and passim. Other articles in the volume edited by Beaver and the writings of K.S. Latourette also describe the changing feelings about the missionary enterprise. Liberal missiology of the between-War period, as represented by Daniel Fleming, Archibald Baker, Oscar Buck, and others, was characterized by a cultural relativism with regard to religions. This relativism was bolstered by a cynical wave of negative publicity about missions work in the public press. A culmination of these liberal views was reached in the 1932 report of the Laymen's Foreign Missions Inquiry, a Rockefeller-funded body established to review the work of the American Protestant missionary enterprise. The group, led by Harvard professor William E. Hocking, concluded that missionaries should not stress the distinct claims of Christianity over against non- Christian religions. The aim of missions should be to cooperate for social improvement. In addition, the rising student generation was demanding more say in the operations and policy of the Movement. Despite organizational changes, a student writing after the 1924 convention in Indianapolis complained about the restraining hand of the \\"Big Four\\" (Speer, Mott, Eddy and Wilder) and insisted that the new numerical majority of students in committees meant little because the adults still had the power.T.T. Brumbaugh, \\"Convention Mistakes\\", SVM Archives, Series V, Fifth Council, 1924. Another continuing problem was the relationship of the Student Volunteer Movement to YMCA and YWCA. A third problem concerned the role of \\"colored\\" students in the SVM. Decreasing financial support exacerbated these problems even before the Depression. As problems accumulated, Movement leaders called for radical changes. In a December 1923 John L. Childs questioned the value of the Movement, pointing to ways in which the missionary situation had evolved past it. He suggested elimination of the declaration card on the grounds that \\"modern missionary activity has become so complex that merely to decide to become a foreign missionary is a step of doubtful value in determining what one shall do with his life.John L. Childs, \\"Should the Policies of the Student Volunteer Movement be Modified? The Intercollegian, December 1923, p. 6.; Paul W. Harrison, in an article entitled \\"The Future of the Student Volunteer Movement\\", suggested that Movement activities were \\"hindered by a most unsuitable mass of administrative machinery.\\" Paul W. Harrison, \\"The Future of the Student Volunteer Movement,\\" The Intercollegian, April 1924, p. 24. The adult and student leaders of the SVM proposed and put into action remedies for many of the less fundamental problems facing the Movement. They instituted an increasingly democratic system of policy formation (as detailed in the description of Series V below). They changed the formats of the conventions to allow more student participation. They discussed numerous possibilities for relating the Movement to the general Christian associations and attempted to increase the Movement's cooperation with home missions agencies. To avert criticism of the declaration card, the secretaries of the Movement urged that the cards be distributed with great reserve and only in conjunction with explanatory material. Committees set up to deal with the problems of \\"colored\\" students recommended that \\"colored\\" institutions be added to the routes of traveling secretaries and that the missions boards be encouraged to reevaluate their restrictions on sending Negro missionaries abroad. On the financial scene, efforts were again made to establish a wider basis of financial support rather than relying so heavily on a few wealthy contributors. ==Conservative and liberal confusion== Remedies for the philosophical questions confronting the Movement were not so easy to propose. The leadership of the Movement was clearly divided on the important issues. Special commissions established in 1925 and 1933 to evaluate the policies of the SVM came to some conclusions but did not solve any problems. It became increasingly difficult for the Movement to maintain its original blend of conservative and liberal elements in a time when conservatism and liberalism were rapidly drifting apart. Executive Committee member E. Fay Campbell wrote to General Secretary Robert Wilder in 1925 expressing the fear that the Student Volunteer Movement was tending to become a conservative general Christian movement, a rival to YMCA and YWCA on the conservative end of the spectrum. Wilder replied: \\"I may be wrong, but I believe that there is more danger of our Movement's losing conservative Volunteers than-liberal Volunteers. In two conservative institutions the Volunteers voted separation from the SVM on the ground that we are too liberal theologically.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Wilder to Campbell, November 27, 1925. Wilder's concluding plea that theological controversy be avoided in Movement work reflected the failure of the SVM leadership to comprehend the inevitability of liberal /conservative conflict in the changing religious scene. The correspondence and documents of the Student Volunteer Movement from this period of its history seem to point to a three layer, conservative/liberal/conservative distribution in the hierarchy of the organization. At the highest echelons of authority men like General Secretary Wilder and his chosen successor, Jesse R. Wilson, as well as various members of the Executive Committee, held to a basically conservative outlook throughout the period. They consistently called for deeper spiritual power in the Movement and emphasized the need for personal evangelical faith. In 1933 the Commission on Student Volunteer Movement Policy submitted a report which among other things questioned the entire \\"reservoir system\\" of missionary recruitment upon which the SVM was based. An interesting exchange of correspondence between two Commission members suggests that the higher echelons deliberately chose to disregard the proposals offered by the Commission: \\"There is an obvious shelving of the evidence. To my mind that pamphlet is nothing short of an unintended but actual betrayal of trust to those who supplied facts and got only one man's opinion in return, or the opinion of his group. My real concern is not for the SVM but for the future of Mr. Wilson. I truly believe that unless he makes a complete turn in his methods of operation, he will be shelved by those demanding a larger vision than exists in the SVM at present.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, 1933 Commission on Student Volunteer Movement Policy. Letter of Newton Peck to Leslie Moss, October 16, 1933. By 1935 Jesse Wilson was considering resigning from the General Secretaryship. A letter from his friend E. Fay Campbell again suggests the extent to which the Movement was wracked by conservative/liberal dissension: \\"Your years as SVM secretary have been terribly hard due to the spirit of the times, R.P. Wilder's ineffective leadership and the situation in the General YMCA-YWCA. It was inevitable that your name and the name of the SVM should be identified with outworn ideas. I know it wasn't true that you didn't believe in social religion, but I also know that the fight for missions has antagonized certain People. You know I have talked on this point many times in YMCA group when you were accused of being only a personal gospel person.\\"SVM Archives, Series III -Campbell to Wilson, May 1935. Below the sphere of Wilder and Wilson there appears to have been a liberal contingent in the SVM which included educational secretaries and traveling secretaries as well as the most articulate and active portion of the actual student volunteers. The existence of this contingent explains the fact that many of the publications and convention themes of the period were rather far to the liberal side of the theological and missiological spectrum despite the SVM's leaders' conservative reputations. Many evidences of a liberal orientation in the Movement could be cited. Liberal missiologists Daniel Fleming and Oscar Buck were among those invited to speak at the 1924 Indianapolis convention. Fleming's book, Contacts with Non-Christian Cultures, was given a very laudatory review by SVM educational secretary Milton Stauffer in the October 1923 issue of Intercollegian. The 1930 issue of the SVM periodical Far Horizons were centered around the primarily social rather than personal gospel themes of l)How do foreign missions meet human suffering?; 2) How do foreign missions create world solidarity? and 3) How do foreign missions fill the hunger of men? The liberal drift of the Student Volunteer Movement was accentuated by the gradual withdrawal of conservative elements from the Movement. By 1925, at least three local Volunteer Bands had disassociated themselves from the national Movement, groups which E. Fay Campbell dismissed as uncooperative \\"controversial fundamentalists.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Campbell to Wilder, December 2, 1925. In 1928, when the Moody Bible Institute withdrew its support of the Movement, Campbell was a bit more concerned: \\"We need their point of view decidedly; in fact it would be nothing short of a major tragedy if they were to pull out of the Movement now and take with them some of our more conservative groups.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Campbell to Wilson, January 31, 1928. Campbell's cause for concern was real. Examination of the denominational preferences of sailed volunteers for the years 1910 to 1930 reveals that while in the earlier years the vast majority of the volunteers had sailed under appointment to mainline denominational boards, as the Movement progressed through the 1920s an increasing proportion of its volunteers were sailing under faith mission boards. This trend in the Student Volunteer Movement reflected a similar tendency in the general missionary movement. The Movement now found itself in danger of losing the support of the conservative core which was supplying an increasing proportion of its volunteers. Faith mission boards, so-called because of their methods of securing personnel and financial support, had long been part of the American missions scene. One of the earliest, the China Inland Mission, had been established in 1865. These mission boards, generally characterized by theological conservatism, had participated wholeheartedly in the early years of the Student Volunteer Movement, though their programs were not nearly so large as those of the mainline denominations. As the gap between conservative and liberal missions theory opened and grew in the years following World War I, the Volunteer Movement found itself increasingly unable to cater simultaneously to the interests of the faith mission boards and the more liberal denominational boards. As the 1930s approached, a growing proportion of missionaries going overseas were supported by faith mission boards. Reasons for this have been suggested by conservative missions historian Harold Lindsell: \\"Liberalism has never been noted for its missionary zeal. The inroads of scientist, behaviorism, and humanism may well have been the consequence of an uncertain theological note which carried no impelling conviction of the Gospel imperative for those without Christ.\\"Harold Lindsell, \\"Faith Missions Since 1938,\\" Frontiers of the Christian World Mission Since 1938, ed. W.C. Harr, New York: Harper and Bros., 1962,p. 210, and Passim. The theology of the faith missions, on the other hand, has had a compelling motivation for missions, asserting that no person can be saved from eternal damnation except through hearing and believing the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The expanding faith missions were not inclined toward ecumenical cooperation. They increasingly drew away from the SVM, draining off financial support as well as potential volunteers. In 1934, General Secretary Jesse Wilson reported to the SVM General Council that \\"Many friends, rightly or wrongly, have questioned the soundness, from an evangelical point of view, of the Movement's present position and have preferred to make their contributions to organizations concerning which no such questions have arisen.\\" A direct rival to the Student Volunteer Movement's work was growing in the conservative wings during this period, although not emerging officially in the United States until 1940 as the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. In 1934, a year after the conservative Intervarsity Missionary Fellowship had been formed in Britain, E. Fay Campbell characterized the Volunteer Movement's position as follows: The SV groups in the US and Canada are in close contact with certain Christian groups which are not being reached very effectively by the General Movements...(but) I do want to remind you that there is a considerable movement of extremely reactionary students springing up in many parts of the world including Great Britain. We are simply crazy if we think that this movement is not going to make real headway in our American colleges.SVM Archives, Series III, Campbell memo, May, 1934. In 1935, General Secretary Jesse Wilson and Vice Chairman of the Administrative Committee C. Darby Fulton resigned, essentially because of the increasingly liberal drift of the Student Volunteer Movement. However, while the official stance of the Movement was becoming defined as liberal, particularly because of its cooperation with YMCA, the evidence also shows that a large portion of the Movement's student constituency continued to be of a rather more conservative cast. In 1928, Jesse Wilson had reported a revival of interest in missions on the campuses he had visited. The total number of outgoing missionaries for 1929 was a twenty-four percent increase over the total number sailing in 1928 and a forty-eight percent increase over the number sailing in 1927. In 1928, there were 252 new student volunteers, while in 1929 there were 609 new volunteers. Wilson thought that the SVM could survive and thrive by falling in with the growing conservative missions revival, but the majority of the Movement leadership was reluctant to see the Movement go in that direction. They were appalled by the fact that the Movement's membership was increasingly conservative. In 1936, reporting on a tour of American campuses, SVM secretary Wilmina Rowland wrote of the following conditions: \\"Some students confess that they have gotten wrong impressions of the missionary enterprise through the Student Volunteers on their campus, who in such cases enlist a pious group of the more dependent- minded students....In summary, it seems to me that the SVM across the country is quite definitely conservative.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Appendix A of the Administrative Committee minutes of May 8, 1936. Information related to the local Student Volunteer groups is also available in Series VI, Field Work. Perusal of the correspondence between SVM headquarters and local Student Volunteer groups during this period confirms Rowland's analysis of the situation. While the Movement had once been a powerful force on prestigious campuses, the majority of Volunteer groups during the 1930s existed at small rural colleges and were propelled by local tradition rather than following closely the lead of the national Movement. ==Redefining the movement== The Student Volunteer Movement's financial situation had never been without problems, but in 1932, America's \\"religious Depression\\", combined with the nation's general economic condition, had led Jesse Wilson to admit that \\"because of financial conditions, we are so puzzled now about our whole program that it is difficult for us to commit ourselves to anything.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Wilson to D.R. Porter, May 23, 1932. The dire economic straits had not lessened by the end of the decade, and it became increasingly evident that the SVM had to regroup and Redefine itself or else cease to exist. While the Student Volunteer Movement had fulfilled a clear and unchallenged role in its early years, as a student missionary education and recruitment agency, the need for such an agency was increasingly questioned in the between-War period. Wilmina Rowland reported in 1936: The influence of the SVM across the country is not heartening. Many persons who believe strongly in missions feel that its days of usefulness are over. A number of foreign mission board secretaries say that if the Movement went out of existence, it would not affect their candidate work. Many, even among the conservative leaders, think that the Movement should revamp its functions and expand its membership if it is to continue its existence.SVM Archives, Series V. Appendix A of the Administrative Committee minutes of May 8, 1936. Statements of denominational missions leaders during this period confirm the conclusions of Rowland. In 1939, Methodist leader H.D. Bollinger wrote: \\"The SVM is a thing of the past and those who are charged with the responsibility of perpetuating it should realize this fact.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Bollinger to Campbell, November 29, 1939. At a meeting of denominational leaders in January 1940, it was suggested that since the SVM had done very little recruiting for the major boards in recent years, and did not seem likely to do more, the boards should set up their own cooperative recruiting system. The gauntlet was thrown out: \\"If the students want the SVM or its equivalent to continue, let them run it and finance it.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Personnel Committee, January 27, 1940. The results of a meeting of denominational leaders in Hartford were discussed at this Personnel Committee meeting. The Student Volunteer Movement entered these years of profound questioning without a stable leadership. In the decade following Jesse Wilson's resignation, four men served as acting or permanent General Secretary of the Movement. The General Council, an experiment in democracy begun after the Des Moines convention, was replaced by a smaller General Committee in 1936, which was in turn replaced by a different organizational arrangement in 1941. Amidst all this confusion, the Movement strove to identify the alternatives for its future existence. Most crucial during the late 1930s and the 1940s were the issues of how the Movement would relate to 1) the general student Christian movements (YMCA,YWCA, denominational student work and union movements), 2) conservative student Christian movements such as the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, 3) the mainline denominational missionary programs, and 4) the evolving missions theory of the period. ==Comparison to other Christian student movements== The 1933 Commission on Student Volunteer Movement Policy, among other suggestions which were disturbing to the SVM leadership, had advocated the establishment of a Student Christian Movement in America which would unite YMCA, YWCA and SVM into one body. This idea was considerably ahead of its time in the United States, although an experimental body of this type had been established in Canada in 1988 and was already the mode of operation in Great Britain. There was, however, a growing conviction that the Volunteer Movement should cooperate very closely with the National Intercollegiate Christian Council (YMCA and YWCA), as well as with denominational bodies, while still maintaining its organizational autonomy. At a consultation at Oberlin College in 1936, measures were taken to consolidate cooperation with the National Intercollegiate Christian Council, including the radical decree that individual SVM members and regional Student Volunteer groups should incorporate all their activities into the NICC work in their locality. In 1939, the National Intercollegiate Christian Council for the first time officially provided for the inclusion of the SVM General Secretary as a member of its Administrative Committee. Friendly relations were also established between the SVM and the University Christian Mission, a cooperative organization representing denominational student work. For a portion of 1938, SVM General Secretary Paul Braisted devoted three-quarters of his time to the Campus Secretaryship of the UCM. A North American Student Conference on the World Mission of Christianity, sponsored by the NICC, the Council of Church Boards of Education, and the SVM, was held in Toronto in December 1939. At this conference it was voted to \\"recommend the continuance of the Student Volunteer Movement as the cooperative agency of the general Student Christian Movements for carrying forward their Christian World Mission emphasis in education and recruiting; and that, in addition, the Movement specialize in the following areas: 1) Establishment of standards of personnel for overseas service, and 2) Recruitment of personnel for missionary areas at home.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, General Committee, January, 1940. The Student Volunteer Movement remained hesitant to sacrifice its autonomy at this phase of the development of student Christian work in the United States because it saw itself as a more ecumenical force than either the NICC or the denominational movements. In 1944, the United Student Christian Council came into being as a national federation of YMCA, YWCA, and denominational student movements. The federation was ecumenical on the national level, but did not express itself ecumenically on the regional or local levels. Though remaining autonomous in policy, administration, and finance, the Student Volunteer Movement agreed to serve as the Missionary Committee of the United Student Christian Council. A dilemma remained for the SVM, however, because the USCC offered no regional ecumenical structures for the Movement to work through. The SVM's role in the USCC was restricted to the national level, to planning the quadrennial student mission conventions and producing educational material. Some itinerating work was possible in the sponsorship of special missions programs on campuses. From 1945 to 1947 the SVM sought to maintain contacts on the local level through a system of \\"campus representatives\\", but this system was not successful. In 1947 a Special Commission on the Future of the Student Volunteer Movement recommended that SVM campus missionary fellowship groups be reestablished. The new missionary fellowship groups were to be informal interest groups, however, rather than official organizations. The Movement had found that students interested in missions were calling for missionary fellowship groups because their special needs were not being met by the general student movements. The dangers of separatism, which had led to the elimination of local Volunteer Bands, seemed less alarming at this point than the dangers of the SVM program losing the support of its volunteers. In 1953, the United Student Christian Council asked the Student Volunteer Movement to become its Missionary Department, as a step toward a fully ecumenical student movement in the United States. After due consideration, the Movement agreed to this next phase, and in 1954 became the Commission on World Mission of the USCC, \\"temporarily relinquishing its status as a member movement of the USCC.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Board of Directors, April, 1954. This was a functional relationship which still did not affect the financial and administrative autonomy of the Student Volunteer Movement. The theory of this relationship was acceptable to the SVM, but in practice certain difficulties emerged. At a SVM Policy Committee meeting in March 1956, it was a cause for concern that USCC member movements did not depend more on the SVM for missionary education. The Committee minutes indicate that both the Presbyterian and Methodist boards of foreign missions had active student departments of their own at this time. In 1959, the United Student Christian Council, the Student Volunteer Movement, and the Interseminary Committee merged to form the National Student Christian Federation. The Student Volunteer Movement became the Commission on World Mission of the NSCF. Its tasks remained those of promoting missionary education, fellowship, and enlistment. It continued to plan and sponsor missions conferences, including the 19th Ecumenical Student Conference on the Christian World Mission held at Athens, Ohio in 1964 with 3000 students present. The National Student Christian Federation was reconstituted as the University Christian Movement in 1966. At this time, as the Concise Dictionary of the Christian World Mission phrases it, \\"the Commission on World Mission was among the first to act on the formation of a movement fully representative of the churches, and agreed that the sense of mission was sufficiently embodied in the student movement for the Commission to cease a separate existence.\\"Stephen Neill, Gerald H. Anderson, and John Goodwin (eds.) Concise Dictionary of the Christian World Mission, New York: Abingdon Press, 1971, p. 434. ==InterVarsity Christian Fellowship== The Student Volunteer Movement's decline, begun after World War I, reached its nadir in 1940. It was clear that if the Movement wanted to continue its existence it could not continue in its old role as a consensus movement acceptable to both conservatives and liberals. There was a parting of the ways, and the Movement had to choose to head in either a conservative or a liberal direction. As evidenced by the Movement's eventual entrance into the National Student Christian Federation, decisions made during this period had the effect of orienting the Movement in a more liberal direction. This orientation was not a foregone conclusion, however, for significant portions of the SVM's constituency and leadership were not in sympathy with the less evangelistic, more humanitarian drift of the \\"Y\\" and major denominational student movements during this period. The SVM's path away from a more conservative basis can be traced in its relations with the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, a student Christian movement established in the United States in 1940. The Volunteer Movement was initially very sympathetic to the aims of the Fellowship. In February 1944 SVM General Secretary Winburn Thomas wrote to a Yale Divinity School student: \\"I feel very keenly that we of the SVM have much to learn from the Inter-Varsity Fellowship, and I would therefore like to see represented on our Board of Directors the intensity of feeling and dynamic purpose which characterizes many of you in that movement.\\"(SVM Archives, Series V, with Board of Directors records, February 1944) When the IVCF was discussed at a Movement meeting in October 1944 it was noted that the IVCF tended to attract \\"doctrinaire and controversial fundamentalists but \\"it was not yet clear that the Fellowship would be dominated by these types.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Board of Directors, October 1944. A Committee of Four was appointed at this meeting to approach the IVCF on matters of mutual concern. In 1948 it was reported to the SVM Board of Directors that many formerly strong student volunteer movements overseas had faded in importance, and missionary education tasks were often carried by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship groups in these countries. The report of the Special Commission on Future Policy at this time recommended that the new campus missionary fellowships being promoted by the SVM should strive to be on good relations with fundamentalist campus groups. Although the Volunteer Movement continued to seek rapprochement with the IVCF, appointing fraternal delegates to its conferences and encouraging reciprocal action, the Fellowship's vigorous missionary program became a direct rival to the program of the SVM. It was the leadership of the IVCF, rather than its constituency, which was most inclined to discourage IVCF-SVM cooperation. In 1949 a SVM traveling secretary reported: \\"In one state school I found that the Inter- Varsity group themselves were not at all aware of the fact that the Fellowship officers on the national level do not wish to cooperate with the SVM. All the students were interested and would have been willing to sign SVM declaration cards, but they had their affiliations with Inter-Varsity and it did not seem wise to interfere....\\"SVM Archives, Series V, with records of Policy Committee, 1956. In the analysis of Vern Rossman, the Movement's fraternal delegate to the IVCF missions conference of 1951, there were four barriers to cooperation between the IVCF and the SVM: l)historical: the IVCF's reaction against the general student movements\\" humanitarian drift of the 1930s and its desire for institutional preservation; 2) psychological: the IVCF's taboos on smoking, dancing, and cosmetics, its particular forms of religious jargon, its inclination toward political and economic conservatism; 3) theological differences; and 4) the IVCF's lack of ecumenical spirit, \\"IVCF sees itself as exclusive in function ... doctrinally pure, true to the Bible ... emphasizing holiness almost to the exclusion of catholicity.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Executive Committee, December 31, 1951. Rossman reported that the IVCF conference program stressed Bible study and worship and although a few unofficial representatives of mainline denomination missions boards attended, the platform speakers generally represented conservative or faith missions boards. Despite the barriers cited by Rossman, the SVM continued to make overtures to the IVCF. In September 1953 the SVM Board of Directors sent a letter to the Associate General Secretary of the IVCF asking for greater cooperation, \\"realizing that we are essentially one in purpose ... .\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Board of Directors, September 1953. It was proposed that the Inter-Varsity Missionary Fellowship be represented on the SVM Quadrennial Planning Committee and on the Board of Directors. The Student Volunteer Movement became increasingly involved in the ecumenical student movement, effectively eliminating the possibility of IVCF cooperation, but it continued to admire the spirit of Fellowship in IVCF groups. At a Policy Committee meeting in 1956, the Committee members still hoped that \\"development of SVM Fellowship groups envisaged on campuses might bring SVM closer to IVCF in understanding.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Policy Committee, March 25, 1956. ==Denominational missions programs== While the Student Volunteer Movement was struggling to find its place in the shifting student Christian movement configuration it was also forced to reevaluate its relationship to the missions work of the major Protestant denominations. In its heyday the SVM had been viewed by the denominational boards as an invaluable tool for drumming up missions interest and providing a pool of recruits from which the boards could select their missionaries. The SVM's broad recruiting system did produce a considerable amount of \\"chaff\\" individuals who could not meet the boards' increasingly rigorous standards for trained and often specialized missionary personnel‚Äîbut, in general, the boards were glad for the Movement's support and had often called upon its files to locate suitable candidates for specific openings overseas. The era of disillusionment after World War I affected denominational missions activity fully as much as it did the Student Volunteer Movement. From the peak year in 1920 when 1731 new missionaries were sent overseas there was a steady decline in the numbers sent, reaching a low point of 550 in 1927 before rising again briefly. It was inevitable that the declining denominational activity would have a direct effect on the SVM's program. As E. Fay Campbell wrote to Jesse Wilson in 1935, \\"It seems harder than ever to get support, chiefly because of the continued financial state of the mission boards which does not permit them to send out many missionaries. It is almost impossible to get People to see the need for our Movement in the face of the fact that the boards are calling for so few new missionaries.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, Campbell to Wilson, March 25, 1935. As mentioned earlier, faith mission boards were experiencing growth during the period of decline of the more liberal denominational boards, but the Volunteer Movement had historically drawn most of its support from the major denominations, and its liberal stances increasingly divorced its program from the faith missions' developing work. In the confusing days of the between-War period the SVM called upon board secretaries to help in evaluation of the Movement's role. Responses to a questionnaire sent out by the SVM's 1933 Commission on Policy indicated that some denominations continued to support the idea of a volunteer movement while others did not see a need for it. Representatives of the Baptist and Congregational boards expressed praise for the Movement while the Episcopal, Methodist and Presbyterian representatives were less enthusiastic. Criticism included the statements that \\"the Movement has dwindled until it is largely a movement of the 'hick' colleges\\" and \\"My fear is that at this present stage the idea of volunteering for foreign missions tends to divert the attention of Christian students from the essential obligation of the Christian, whether he goes to the field or stays at home.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, 1933 Commission. Before 1920, most denominations had not sponsored their own student fellowships and the SVM's role on campus had been clear. Partially in reaction to the liberal orientation of the \\"Y\\" movements, denominations developed their own campus student groups during the 1920s and 1930s. The effect of this trend was to obscure the SVM's role. According to a SVM report written in 1953, \\"In the late thirties, the pressure became so strong that SVM was forced to question its very existence, for many of those within the church student movement‚Äîwhich, by its very nature, was pushing SVM into a separatist movement‚Äîchallenged the SVM and said that it should not operate as a separate movement.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Board of Directors, April 1933. The development of the Student Volunteer Movement's relationship with denominational campus ministries has been touched upon earlier, but here can be mentioned briefly the more direct channels of contact with denominational mission boards which the SVM maintained throughout its existence. When the National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America emerged in 1950, the SVM's role in the new organization was as a member Unit of its Division of Foreign Missions, Division of Home Missions and Joint Commission on Missionary Education. The NCCCUSA viewed the SVM as primarily an interdenominational recruiting agency to work among students. As the organization of the National Council of Churches evolved, the SVM became the Missionary Services Department of the Joint Department of Christian Vocation of the Division of Christian Education in 1951. In 1959 when the Volunteer Movement passed from autonomous existence, it was related to the National Council of Churches as the Department of Missionary Services of the Commission on Christian Higher Education. ==Missions theory== Various theories regarding missions activity have prevailed in American Protestantism during different historical periods. An early emphasis on evangelization for individual salvation gave way to concentration on church planting and educational work as bases for the spread of the Christian faith. With the rise of indigenous churches overseas the concept of ecumenical sharing gave continued justification for missionary activity. The Laymen's Commission of Appraisal in 1932 proposed a more radical conception of missionary work which involved not only inter-church development but also inter-faith development, drawing on increased appreciation for non-Christian religions. However, in Charles Forman's words, \\"the reaction of mission boards showed that the mission theory and theology of the Laymen's Commission was not that of American missions.\\"Forman, p. 103. When missions activity was no longer viewed as an exporting of Christian civilization, but rather seen as a mode of worldwide ecumenical cooperation, the distinction between foreign missions and home missions became blurred. Throughout the post-World War I era, the Student Volunteer Movement constantly had to justify its continuing specific concentration on foreign missions. The \\"revolutionaries\\" of Des Moines in 1920 questioned the appropriateness of sending missionaries abroad when conditions in American were so much in need of Christianization. In a meeting in February 1920, the Standing Committee discussed at length the pros and cons of Student Volunteer Movement involvement in home missions work, but decided to continue the status quo focus on recruiting for foreign fields only. In 1922, a new home missions movement, the Student Fellowship for Christian Life Service, approached the SVM seeking cooperation; for over a year it used a room in the Movement offices as its headquarters. It was not until 1945 that the Student Volunteer Movement went beyond cooperation with home missions programs to actual participation in recruiting and educational activity for home fields. It changed its name from the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions to the Student Volunteer Movement for Christian Missions. The announcement of this change noted that: official action recognizes that the artificial separation of home and foreign missions is now passe', since the work of the Church, even as the world itself, is one. Whether the distinction between the pioneer, frontier worker on the one hand, and the supporting work on the other, can be or should be maintained for recruitment purposes remains to be seen.SVM Archives, Series V, 1945 documents: \\"SVM Prepares for Reconversion of Missionary Enterprise\\", p. 3\\\\. The declaration card of the Movement, which formerly had offered only one option, commitment to foreign missions, was revised to offer three alternatives: * I. It is my purpose to become a Christian missionary ... at home or ... abroad. * II. I propose to seek further guidance regarding the missionary vocation. * III. I propose to support the world mission of the Church through my prayers, gifts and daily work.SVM Archives, Series V, Board of Directors, 1949. This format for the declaration card came under attack from two different angles. Some thought that the Movement was making a mistake in relinquishing its specific focus on foreign missions education and recruitment. They thought that the Movement would become too diffuse and would lose any effectiveness which it still had. At the opposite end of the spectrum, others questioned the entire idea of a declaration card, wondering why the choice of a missionary vocation should be singled out for specific attention, since the Church's mission to the world could be carried out through nearly all vocations. In 1949 a Committee to Study the Declaration Card was established and it proposed the following format for the card: * ... It is my purpose to use my talents and resources to serve the Christian world mission, and in the light of its claims prayerfully to choose my life work. * ... Further, it is my purpose, God willing, to be a Christian missionary ... at home ... abroad. More than the phrasing of words on a 3\\" by 5\\" card was at-stake in discussion of the Student Volunteer Movement declaration of purpose. There was a question of missions theory‚Äîhow was missionary activity to be distinguished from the normal interrelationships of Christian churches throughout the world? There was the related issue of the membership basis of the SVM‚Äîshould it be restricted to individuals who had made a specifically missionary vocational commitment or should a wider base of students, those who were supportive of the Church's world mission, be considered members of the Movement? At a meeting in March 1952, Policy Committee members expressed divergent opinions. E. Fay Campbell felt that \\"The regular membership of the SVM should be made up of students ... who have purposed to offer themselves to Missions Boards for service.\\" Vern Rossman called the first statement on the declaration card \\"highly problematic.\\" \\"If we say that every Christian student should be centrally missionary, then every student 'should be' an SVMer.\\" But, in another members opinion, \\"If one of the prime duties of the Christian community is to point out that almost all vocations can be 'Christian,' then surely the SVM is in a sense defeating the purpose of the Church by creating the feeling that service under a mission board is necessarily more important in the world mission than other vocations.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Policy Committee, March 1952. As the 1950s progressed and the Student Volunteer Movement became increasingly involved in ecumenical ventures it became clear that the Movement would have a distinct contribution to make to the student Christian scene only if it focused its concerns quite specifically on education and recruitment for world missions service under established mission boards and agencies. The distinction implied by this focus, between the Church's general mission in the world and its \\"missions\\", was not agreeable to all, but without such a distinction the need for a Student Volunteer type movement became much less apparent. Those striving to maintain the SVM's distinctiveness felt that the Movement still had a role to play in concentrating on the \\"frontiers\\" of the Church mission to the world. There were still many places around the world where strong indigenous churches had not been established and the SVM could help to provide Christian messengers to those areas. Furthermore' it was felt that even the stronger indigenous churches overseas would increasingly welcome the assistance of Western missionaries. As a missionary to China had written to John Mott, \\"Members of the younger Christian churches have actually taken over the responsibility for determining the future character of the Christian movement and, having worked at this job for a period of years, they now realized its complexity and the need for comradeship.\\"SVM Archives, Series III, L. Hoover to J. Mott, October 1, 1936. Another \\"frontier\\" which the SVM Newsletter suggested for the Student Volunteer Movement's attention in 1957, was confrontation with atheistic communism. In the years after the Student Volunteer Movement's merger into the National Student Christian Federation, a Committee for the Fellowship of Student Volunteers produced a monthly newsletter. A large proportion of the articles in these newsletters were related to missions theory, indicating the realization that until these questions of theory were resolved the role of student volunteers could not be clarified. In the May 1960 newsletter there was a call for an \\"adequate theology of mission\\". The problems were evident. \\"We used to feel that the Church has missions and thought of missions as something which was done for the other People at some distant place. Such an understanding was based on the assumption that Western Christians live in a Christian society and the Christian missionary task was to take our faith and culture to those areas where it was not known.\\"Newsletter of the Committee for the Fellowship of Student Volunteers, SVM Archives, Series VII, May 1960. The 1966 dissolution of the Student Volunteer Movement in its guise as the National Student Christian Federation's Commission on World Mission was the logical outcome of an increasingly prevalent theory of mission in liberal American Protestantism, one which stressed the worldwide ecumenical cooperation of the Church rather than focusing on frontier missions of the Western Church to the non-Western world. ==After World War II== As indicated by the foregoing, a considerable portion of the Student Volunteer Movement's energy in the era after World War II continued to be taken up in attempts to define its relationships to other student Christian movements and to general Protestant mission mechanics and theory. Despite the uncertainties involved in these evolving relationships, the Movement was able to bounce back from its 1940 nadir and to continue with a positive program for nearly two more decades. Sydney Ahlstrom, among other historians of American religion, has described a post World War II revival in American Christianity which extended nearly to the end of the 1950s. Amidst social trends of urbanization and suburbanization, geographical mobility, and economic affluence, problems of adjustment and anxieties over status and 'acceptance' were ever-present. Churches were obviously the sort of family institution that the social situation required.\\" .Ahlstrom, p. 951 The Cold War atmosphere of the era was ripe for the resurgence of a religious faith which could promise peace of mind. Fundamentalist theology which had fallen into disrepute was revived in an intellectually updated form. During the 1920s and 1930s Student Volunteer Movement leaders had frequently pointed out that the decline of the Movement was directly related to a decline in general interest in religion on American campuses. Students were not likely to commit themselves to missionary work when they were not wholly committed to the Christian faith. A resurgence of more evangelical religion during and after World War II allowed the SVM to find a broader base for its programs. The Board of Directors in 1944 concluded that \\"The Movement needs to make increasingly clear its commitment to a full evangelical missionary message and program ... Not alone in emphasis on current social improvement, but also in and through such service to a message that is in the fullest sense redemptive and eternal, will be its strength.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, Appendix III, Board of Directors minutes, February 26, 1944. In 1946, the Student Volunteer Movement's listing of missionary openings, Christian Horizons, included nearly one thousand overseas vacancies. A publicity release for the Movement claimed that \\"faced today with the need for hundreds of new workers, both large and small boards look to the Student Volunteer Movement for assistance, both in supplying candidates to meet immediate needs, and in conducting a program of education and recruitment which will guarantee a steady stream of volunteers from which the boards can select personnel.\\"SVM Archives, Series V, 1945 document: \\"SVM Prepares for Reconversion of Missionary Enterprise,\\" p. 1. At a meeting of the SVM Board of Directors in April 1948, it was reported that the Movement's finances were in good condition and there were many evidences of increased missionary interest on the campuses. The Movement budget for 1951/1952 was $60,400, more than $10,000 above the budget of the previous year and six times the budget of 1941/1942. During the academic year 1952/1953 a travel staff of twenty men and women from five denominations visited over three hundred colleges in forty-four states on behalf of the Movement. The resurgence sparked by increased religious interest and the nation's improving economic condition appears to have peaked for the SVM towards the middle of the 1950s, or at least to have taken a different form as the Movement was drawn into ecumenical ventures and faced with theoretical questions about its recruiting program. Twenty-one members of the Movement travel staff visited three hundred and fifty campuses during the academic year 1955/1956. At the same time, however, there were only five hundred declared student volunteers on American undergraduate campuses. The SVM budget for 1956/1957 was reduced to $50,000. Programs of missionary education and support of student volunteers were carried on after the formation of the National Student Christian Federation by the Commission on World Mission and its Committee for the Fellowship of Student Volunteers. In May 1962 it was reported that the Committee's newsletter was sent to over three thousand volunteers or prospective volunteers. The Commissions program included staff visits to campuses, local Fellowship gatherings of volunteers, Week-End Conversations on Mission, personal encouragement and counseling, Frontier Seminars, the Quadrennial Conference, ecumenical summer service projects, and so forth. ==Leaders and participants== Partial list of those not mentioned in the article. *William Scott Ament *Walter Judd *Kenneth Scott Latourette *H.

Early travelers would have to jump off the side to get over it, hence the name. Early writers claimed the site was connected with Native American mythology. Natural forces separated it from the mainland in the 1890s, and its large arch collapsed in 1916. Between 1920 and 1970, the majority of the sea stack collapsed, and by 1990 it had been swept away, and little trace remains today.

Unlike some other desktop computers, such as the HP 9830, it had a cathode ray tube (CRT) in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer-controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard. Microcoded to run interpretive BASIC, about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide. The 2200 evolved into a desktop computer and larger system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s.Wang Offers End Users Portable Unit, Workstations, By Esther Surden, Computerworld - 5 Apr 1976 - Page 35, ...the 2200 PCS portable system...Model 2200WS workstation... The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster. Unlike the other product lines such as the VS and OIS, Wang Laboratories aggressively used value-added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii- and Hong Kong-based firm, Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s. ==HistoryEarly 2200 models=== The first models of the 2200, released in April 1973, were the 2200A, B, differing in the amount of microcode so the B model held additional commands in Wang BASIC. The extra commands in the B model were mostly related to data handling, allowing BASIC programs to construct databases with relative ease. The later C model added a small number of additional commands, including basic error handling. The A, B and C were replaced by the S and T models, which re-implemented the CPU using newer, higher-density large scale integration parts. S models added commands to convert strings to and from numbers and a few other commands. The T version added a complete set of matrix math commands like those seen in later versions of Dartmouth BASIC as well new input/output functions. The S and T machines also used an internal power supply, rather than the external one used in the earlier models. The E and F models had features similar to those of the S and T, but was yet another re-implementation of the CPU and this time housed the system in a case from a terminal. Another change was the input/output subsystem, which made I/O cards for the E/F incompatible with the earlier machines. ===Later \\"2600\\" models=== A complete re-design of the CPU was underway as early as 1974. This was not simply a re-implementation of the same underlying CPU using new components, the CPU ran an entirely different machine code. This was invisible to the user, because the line had always coded its BASIC in microcode, not the machine language, and the user only had access to the microcode. This meant user programs including \\"machine code\\" continued to run on the new CPUs in spite of them having completely different instructions. The new machine was introduced at the September 1976 Westcon show and shipped the next year as the 2200VP Its BASIC-2's disk access permitted not only filename-based access, called \\"Automatic File Cataloging\\" but also but also \\"Absolute Sector Addressing.\\" The latter enabled setting up one's own type of database. Up to 16 files could be simultaneously be open. Two language features, $GIO and $IF ON/OFF, facilitated a wide range of devices, including for telecommunications. Wang 2200MVP was a multi-user \\"upgrade.\\" Wang claimed to support \\"High-speed printers (up to 600 lmp),SIC! LPM IBM diskette and 9-Track magnetic tape compatibility, telecommunications and special instrument controllers.\\" In the early 1980s the VP series was replaced by a single-chip VLSI implementation, the \\"Micro VP\\". It was otherwise similar to the earlier versions. ===386-based versions=== The last models of the 2200 series were introduced in July 1989 as the 2200 CS/386. This used a 16 MHz Intel 80386 as the CPU and implemented the 2200 microcode on top. The entire machine fit onto a single plug-in card that replaced the VP style CPU in the existing chassis design, using all of the existing peripherals. BASIC was implemented in 256 kB of static RAM loaded from disk, and used an incremental compiler rather than an interpreter as in previous versions. In March 1991, the CS/386 Turbo replaced it, running at 32 MHz. ==Soviet clone== In the 1970s, Wang 2200 computers were extensively used by Gosplan and Goskomstat, the main Soviet planning and statistical agencies. The fear of backdoors in the Western hardware led to the reverse engineering of the original system and the development of the a 100% binary-compatible clone. The development started in 1978, and the series production began in 1980, so the oft-cited reason of CoCom restriction in the wake of Afghan War (which started in 1980) appear to be baseless. Soviet computer historians note that the Gosplan and Goskomstat users much preferred the original Wang hardware, so the clones were mainly used by the other organizations, mainly in research and industry. It was helped by the fact that Iskra, while 100% software compatible with the Wang's T-Basic code, had completely different internal structure and included many features that made it an excellent industrial controller, such as twin high- speed RS-232 interfaces, IEEE-488 equipment control interface, and CAMAC crate control circuitry. Later a somewhat simplified Unix port was created to run on this machine. ==End of production== Overshadowed by the Wang VS, the 2200 languished as a cost-effective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it. In the late 1980s Wang revisited the 2200 for one last dip in the revenue well, offering 2200 customers a new 2200 CS with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging 2200 systems. The 2200 CS was accompanied by updated disk units and other peripherals, and most 2200 customers moved up to the 2200 CS, after which Wang left the market and never again developed any new 2200-series products. In 1997 Wang reported having about two hundred 2200 systems still under maintenance around the world. Throughout, Wang had always offered maintenance services for the 2200. Wang 2200 Basic2 code can run on PCs and Unix systems using compilers and runtime libraries sold by NiakwaNiakwa or Kerridge.Kerridge These allow accessing the much larger, inexpensive random- access memory and disk space available on modern hardware. The programs run many times faster than they did on the 2200 hardware. ==References== == External links == * Wang 2200 Extensive information about the Wang 2200 * Wang 2200 Emulator A true emulator of the Wang 2200 * Wang 2200 on YouTube Video showing a running Wang 2200 System Category:Minicomputers Category:Personal computers Category:1973 introductions ","title":"Wang 2200"},{"id":"9094522","text":"Walter Montgomery Jackson (1863‚Äì1923) was the founder of encyclopedia publisher Grolier, Inc., and he was the partner of Horace Everett Hooper in publishing the 10th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and in developing its 11th edition. He split with Hooper in 1908-1909 in a nasty legal fight after failing to wrest control of the Britannica from Hooper, == Early life and career == Jackson was born in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts, and he began to work cleaning the bookshop and offices of Estes and Lauriat in Boston, ten miles from his birthplace. By the age of 22, he was a partner in the firm, overseeing the manufacturing and publishing. He helped expand the distribution of the firm, but quickly became involved in other publishing ventures as part-owner or director. Jackson founded the Grolier Society, which specialized in making extra-fine editions of classics and rare literature. The Society was named after the Grolier Club, which had been founded in 1884 to advance the arts involved in making books and which was named after a well- known French bibliophile, Jean Grolier de Servi√®res. After the split with Hooper he acquired the rights to publish the British The Children's Encyclopaedia under the name Book of Knowledge. The Children's Encyclopedia was a 10-volume compilation of a popular children's journal of the same name founded and edited by Arthur Mee and published by Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe. Being an assembly of the journal issues, the encyclopedia was not organized alphabetically, but rather topically; navigation was assisted by an index in the final volume. Jackson secured the American reprint rights in 1910 after resolving some copyright issues with Lord Northcliffe, Grolier, Inc. subsequently became a large publisher of general encyclopaedias, including Academic American Encyclopedia, and the software Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia. ==References== * Category:1863 births Category:1923 deaths Category:American publishers (people) ","title":"Walter Montgomery Jackson"},{"id":"9094540","text":"The following colleges and universities were founded by Christian organisations.

It revolves around several opera fans, especially of the opera singer Maria Callas, and their gay relationships. ==Overview== The play focuses on two of the playwright's favorite subjects, gay relationships and Maria Callas. The play has one of his most memorable characters, flamboyantly bitchy and viciously wicked opera queen Mendy. Peter Mark describes him: \\"...eccentric Mendy, who presides over the first act's delicious envelopment in opera trivia as if he himself had been trapped in a perpetual production of 'Tosca.'\\" Stephen, a depressed literary editor and opera fanatic, is on the verge of losing his doctor lover to a considerably younger Columbia University student. In Act I, he takes temporary refuge at the apartment of fellow opera aficionado Mendy to dish about divas, listen to records, and avoid thinking about his rapidly unravelling eight-year relationship. In Act II, he returns home to confront his unfaithful partner. The play derives its title from an actual 1958 Callas production of La Traviata at Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos in the Portuguese capital. Two thousand copies of an unauthorized recording made by a cast member during a live performance, despite their amateur quality, quickly became collector's items among the diva's fans.Marques, Nuno Miguel. \\"Champagne And Coca-Cola, The True Story Of The Lisbon Traviata\\" classicalvoice.org, March 22, 2002 Stephen recently has acquired one which he neglected to bring with him, and Mendy is obsessed with his going home to retrieve it. ==Production history== An earlier version of the play was produced at the Theatre Off Park, New York City, by Sherwin M.

The crossbow is, for technical purposes, often categorized as a firearm by various legal jurisdictions, despite the fact that no combustion is required to propel the projectile. This is a list of laws concerning crossbows by country. In some nations crossbows are not subject to any specific regulation, in most there are laws, which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its own definition of a crossbow, and in some cases pistol-sized crossbows are treated differently. There may be minimum ages for possession, and sales of both crossbows and bolts may be restricted. Specific rules around hunting use are also common. Some jurisdictions require permits and background checks similar to those required for firearms. ==Australia== Pistol crossbows are strictly controlled in all Australian states due to their concealable nature. Crossbows can be bought and owned by adults over 18 years of age, while in most states crossbows can only be owned with a special licence, for instance for members of an official sporting club. Control on transport of crossbows between states has increased to prevent unauthorised use of imported crossbows.Ausbow Industries - Australian crossbow manufacturer and agent for Excalibur crossbow Recent changes to laws in Western Australia to prohibit crossbow ownership require applications to legally possess a crossbow by July 2, 2011 before they became illegal to possess and sporting usage is only legal for people currently participating in the sport at the date of the laws introduction and does not apply to or allow for new participants thereafter. ==Bulgaria== In Bulgaria crossbows are not regulated, but their use for fishing and hunting is explicitly prohibited. ==Canada== In Canada, crossbows are not classified as a firearm and can be acquired or manufactured by or sold to anyone over 18 years of age. According to the Criminal Code, barrelled weapons launching a projectile at a muzzle velocity not exceeding are also not considered firearmshttps://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-20.html. This ensures no licence is required to purchase a crossbow, unless it is barrelled and launches projectiles at a velocity exceeding . Though older PAL cards say that one is allowed to acquire one, the laws designating them as firearms were struck down before they could be implemented. Crossbows designed to be fired with one hand and crossbows measuring less than 500 mm in length are prohibited.http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/index-eng.htm Some municipalities also have bylaws prohibiting the discharging and/or possession of firearms within city limits, and those laws usually define bows, crossbows, and slingshots as firearms. Hunting in Canada is regulated at the provincial level, therefore the legality of crossbow hunting vary from province to province. ==Czech Republic== Crossbows and other mechanical weapons with drawing force under are not regulated. Mechanical weapons above this limit are class D weapons, which means they can only be used or owned by a person at least 18 years of age (no license is required) and can't be worn visibly in public. They can only be used at places not accessible to public (without posing a risk to health or property), at licensed shooting ranges and at visibly marked places oversighted by a designated person. ==Denmark== In Denmark, the creation, import or possession of crossbows without a license is prohibited by Danish law on weapons (V√•benloven - Bekendtg√∏relse af lov om v√•ben og eksplosivstoffer), and crossbows are not recognized as legal weapons for hunting. ==Finland== In Finland, crossbows are banned for hunting. Possession of crossbows and other bows requires no licence.http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1996/19961374 In other legal aspects the crossbow is parallel to an air gun. ==Germany== In German law on weapons, crossbows and firearms are equated in their legal status as weapons (WaffG Anlage 1 1.2.2), but in contrast to guns, acquisition, possession, trade or production of crossbows requires no license (WaffG Anlage 2). Because of their definition as weapons, but without further restrictions, any crossbows can be used by minors under custody of competent adults. Fishing and hunting with crossbows is prohibited. As a specialty to be noted is that, crossbows do not shoot as per legal definition in Germany, since they don't use expanding gases or similar mechanisms to propel a projectile. ==Netherlands== In the Netherlands crossbows are regulated by the \\"wet weapons en munitie\\" (law on weapons and ammunition). Crossbows and crossbow bolts are placed in category 4, along with bows, swords, spears, etc. It is legal to possess weapons from this category providing that the individual is over 18. It is not allowed to carry those weapons in public. When transporting, the weapon should be packaged in a way that one has to perform at least 3 actions before the weapon is ready for use (this does not include the steps required to actually load and fire the weapon). Only on special occasions such as re- enactment events this is not strictly enforced. Crossbows should be used only for collecting, re-enactment or sportive purposes. Hunting with crossbows (or bows) is strictly prohibited in the Netherlands under animal cruelty laws. ==Norway== In Norway, crossbows are considered equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license (Innf√∏rsel og utf√∏rsel av v√•pen, Tollvesenet). Hunting with crossbows is not allowed. ==Poland== In Poland, crossbows are considered a 'dangerous devices' equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license (Dz.U.2003/52/451). Hunting with crossbows is not allowed (Dz.U.2005/61/548). ==Sweden== In Sweden, crossbows are considered equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license. Hunting with crossbows is not allowed. Swedish law dictates that any weapon that stores its energy, i.e., weapons with a firing mechanism, that produces more than at the muzzle are illegal without licence. Thus very weak crossbows are sold in toy stores as well as low powered air rifles (not sold to minors). Sale or possession of normal bows of any strength are regulated in the same way as the previously mentioned weak crossbows and air rifles. ==United Kingdom== No licence or registration is required to own a crossbow in the United Kingdom. Under the Crossbows Act 1987, crossbows cannot be bought or sold in England, Wales or Scotland by or to those under 18. Possession is also prohibited by those under 18 years old except under adult supervision. The act states that crossbows may be used by persons under 18 years of age only when supervised by a person aged 21 years old or over.Office of Public Sector Information - Crossbows Act 1987 Similar prohibitions for Northern Ireland are made in the Crossbows (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Section 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prevents their use for hunting birds. In Scotland, section 50 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 Section 50 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 makes it illegal to be drunk in a public place in possession of a crossbow. Section 44 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 raised the age limit from 17 to 18 in England and Wales, with effect from 1 October 2007.The Crown prosecution Service - Offensive weapons retrieved 29 January 2008 The Scottish Parliament made similar changes in section 62 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007,Section 62 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 also with effect from 1 October 2007. ==United States== It is legal to own a crossbow. Rules regarding hunting with crossbow vary by state. (Laws By State) Can a convicted felon hunt with a bow or crossbow? Can A Felon Own a Crossbow Michigan Any licensed hunter who has obtained a free crossbow stamp can hunt with a crossbow during any season in which a firearm is allowed, for both big and small game, except hunters in the Upper Peninsula may not use a crossbow or a modified bow during the Dec. 1 - Jan. 1 late archery deer season and Dec. 7-16 muzzleloader deer season, unless the hunter is disabled and has a crossbow permit or special permit to take game with a modified bow. Any licensed hunter may use a crossbow throughout the archery deer season in the Lower Peninsula (Oct. 1 - Nov. 14 and Dec. 1 - Jan. 1) and during the early archery deer season in the Upper Peninsula (Oct. 1 - Nov. 14). Crossbow use is not allowed in the Red Oak Unit during the archery-only bear season (Oct. 5-11) except for certified hunters with a disability. The DNR may issue a crossbow permit or a special permit to take game with a modified bow to a person with a valid hunting license to take a deer during an open deer season, if the person is certified as having permanent or temporary disability, as defined in Wildlife Conservation Order 5.95, which renders a person unable to use conventional archery equipment. Hunters may use a modified bow where crossbows are legal. A modified bow is a bow, other than a crossbow, that has been physically altered so that it may be held, aimed and shot with one arm. When hunting deer, bear, elk and turkey, crossbow hunters must use only arrows, bolts and quarrels with a broadhead hunting type of point not less than wide with a minimum of in length.

The anime was released in the English language in the United States in 1984 as Honey Honey. It was also broadcast in various European countries and in Latin America. ==Story== The story begins in the city of Vienna in 1907, as the city holds a lavish birthday celebration for its beloved Princess Flora. The princess entertains a variety of suitors from around the world who have come to propose marriage. Also on hand for the celebration is Phoenix, a handsome, suave jewel thief who has his eye on stealing the princess's precious gemstone, the \\"Smile of the Amazon,\\" which the princess wears as a ring. Phoenix remarks that Flora, though renowned worldwide for her great beauty, wouldn't be nearly as beautiful without her ring. Furious at the insult, Princess Flora then drops the ring holding her gemstone into a cooked fish and throws it out the window, to the shock of everyone present. Meanwhile, a young teenaged orphan named Honey Honey is working as a waitress. Her pet cat and constant companion, Lily, spies the fish that the princess threw out the window and proceeds to eat the entire fish, thus swallowing the ring. Since Princess Flora has declared that whichever of her suitors successfully returns the ring to her shall become her husband, the princess's suitors and Phoenix immediately fan out all over the city pursuing Lily and her owner, Honey Honey. Phoenix catches up with Honey and Lily and helps them hide from their pursuers. Honey proceeds to tell the handsome jewel thief the story of how she was orphaned and brought up in a convent, and of how she befriended Lily, who, like her, was abandoned. Phoenix then tries to persuade Honey to sell Lily to him, but Honey, who is still unaware that Lily has swallowed the princess's ring, furiously refuses (after driving Phoenix's initial offer of a million dollars up to ten million dollars, and then coming to her senses) and immediately flees. Honey and Lily hide in the basket of a hot-air balloon, which soon lifts off with Phoenix and Princess Flora's suitors still in hot pursuit. Thus begins an adventure in which Honey and Lily are pursued by Phoenix, Princess Flora, and her suitors to various cities around the world, including Paris, New York City, Oslo, London, Monte Carlo, Tokyo, and Gibraltar. Along the way, Honey falls in love with Phoenix and tries to keep Lily out of the clutches of the selfish, vain princess. Eventually, Flora's ring is removed from Lily's body, but this is not the end of the story. The series concludes with the discovery that Honey Honey is in fact Flora's younger sister, a princess of a very tiny Prussian country whose name is actually Priscilla. When she was captured by a nomadic people, who force young women to run bare feet over a pit of hot coals to see if any one of them have revealed a tattoo of a rose on her foot, Honey Honey turned out to have that tattoo that they were searching for so long. Honey Honey is captured by the evil Slag, a man who caused her kingdom to be destroyed after going through an agonizing defeat. Slag takes Honey Honey into his castle within the Siberian wastelands. Honey Honey manages to escape with help from Phoenix, after he somehow managed to help a mystical alien with a flying saucer (which sort of explains the tunguska event in 1908). Sometime later Honey Honey is reunited with her father, who is working as a gardener for some Russian aristocrats in Moscow. Honey Honey, her father and Phoenix escape, but they are sold into slavery at Constantinopole. Honey Honey is bought by an Indian Sultan who is obsessed with magic tricks. Honey Honey gets her hands onto the Sultan's magic carpet, which she uses to fly into Japan and Los Angeles and finally to the show's climax in New York. At New York Princess Flora, her suitors, Phoenix and Honey Honey's father have managed to get into the city as well. The final episode also involves King Kong to be shown in the series, after it captures Princess Flora when it manages to break free from the show held by the Princess' suitors. Honey Honey manages to save Flora from King Kong by using her kind heart and sympathy. Honey Honey finally learns why everyone wanted Lily, and makes peace with Flora after their sisterhood is revealed at New York in the final episode. Honey Honey also marries Phoenix (the son of the nomadic tribe's leader, actually). Also in the end of the final episode, Princess Flora tosses the ring from the window a second time. Her servants start to chase a small dog, who swallowed the ring this time, by accident. However, they don't know that the ring was actually a fake. ==Anime distribution== The anime version of Honey Honey, produced by Kokusai Eiga-sha (Movie International Company) and animated by Toei Animation's Korean division, lasted 29 half-hour episodes and was broadcast in Tokyo on Fuji TV and on affiliated stations KTV in Osaka and Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting Saturdays at 18:00 local time from October 1981 to May 1982. As the show was scheduled in non-network air time, other stations in the Fuji (CX) network were not obligated to carry it, and in other markets the show aired in different time slots or on non-Fuji affiliated stations. Minori Matsushima (Sayaka Yumi in Mazinger Z and Candice in Candy Candy) provided the voice of Honey Honey, Fuyumi Shiraishi (Mirai Yashima in Mobile Suit Gundam) voiced Princess Flora, and Phoenix was voiced by Makio Inoue. Masaki Tsuji, previously a writer for the unrelated Cutie Honey and numerous other works (anime and otherwise), was the series' head writer, and Takeshi Shirado, a Toei veteran whose credits included Cutie Honey, Mazinger Z, Devilman and Space Battleship Yamato, served as series director. Youko Seri, a pop singer who was popular throughout Asia at the time (particularly in China), sang the series' opening and ending themes. The anime aired in the same Saturday- evening time slot as several popular Super Sentai shows, and achieved low ratings as a result; thus, the series was canceled early, and several manga storylines, including one in which Honey Honey visits Hollywood, did not appear in the anime. However, the TV series would later achieve a fair amount of success in Europe and Latin America (although many of the character names were changed in the non-English dubs; i.e., Honey Honey is Pollen in French, Fiorellino in the first Italian dub, Favos de Mel in Portuguese, and Silvia in Spanish). Dubbed into English by Sound International Corporation, with distribution by Modern Programs International, the anime series aired, uncut, in the United States on the CBN Cable Network (later known as The Family Channel) in 1984 and was also partially released on home video by Sony. Enoki Films U.S. currently holds the American license to the anime series. ==Anime staff== * Original Story ** Hideko Mizuno * Executive Producer ** Juzo Tsubota * Chief Directors ** Takeshi Shirato, Yoshikata Nitta * Episode Directors ** Takeshi Shirato, Minoru Hamada, Shoichi Yasumura, Hiromi Yamamoto, Yoshikata Nitta, Kozo Takagaki, Hiromichi Matano, Kazuya Miyazaki, Eikichi Kojika * Script ** Masaki Tsuji, Shun'ichi Yukimuro, Toyohiro Ando, Naoko Miyake * Character Designs ** Kozo Masanobe * Animation Directors ** Takeshi Shirato, Akira Daikuhara, Akira Shinoda, Joji Kikuchi, Eiji Uemura, Hiroshi Iino, Nobumichi Kawamura * Art Director ** Yoshiyuki Yamamoto * Music ** Akihiro Komori * Theme Song ** OP- HƒÅto wa ≈åsuwagi, ED- Niji ni Sh≈çjo, performed by Youko Seri * Production ** Kokusai Eiga-sha (Movie International Co., Ltd.) / Toei Animation / Fuji TV ==References== ==External links== * Enoki Films' Honey Honey anime page (English) * * Category:1966 manga Category:1981 anime television series Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Drama anime and manga Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Sh≈çjo manga Category:Toei Animation television Category:1982 Japanese television series endings Category:Anime series based on manga ","title":"Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken"},{"id":"9094714","text":"The Cathedral High School in Bangalore, Karnataka is a co-educational institute affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE).

In case of Komissariatsky Bridge, completion (1927) and opening to regular traffic (1960) are separated by decades; only the earliest year (1927) is listed. == Bridges over Moskva River and Moskva Canal == *Khimkinsky Bridges (–•–∏–º–∫–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–æ—Å—Ç—ã) over Moskva Canal, road:MKAD, 1997 and 1998 *Leningradsky Bridge (–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç) over Moskva Canal, road, 1970 *Spassky Bridges (–°–ø–∞—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–æ—Å—Ç—ã), road:MKAD, 1998 and 1962) not to be confused with downtown Novospassky Bridge *Stroginsky Bridge (–°—Ç—Ä–æ–≥–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, tram, 1982 *Moscow-Riga Railroad Bridge over Moskva Canal, rail, 1936 *Zhivopisny Bridge (–ñ–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 2007 *Khoroshevsky Bridge (–•–æ—Ä–æ—à—ë–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç) over Moskva River Shortcut, road, 1938 *Karamyshevsky Bridge (–ö–∞—Ä–∞–º—ã—à–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç) over Moskva River Shortcut, road, 1937 *Krylatsky Bridge (–ö—Ä—ã–ª–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1984 *Kraspopresnensky Bridge (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1965 *Filevsky Rail Bridge (–§–∏–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), rail, 1875/1938/1961 *Dorogomilovsky Rail Bridge (–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–º–∏–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), rail, 1907 *Dorogomilovsky Road Bridge (–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–º–∏–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Third Ring, 2000 *Bagration Bridge (–ú–æ—Å—Ç –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω), pedestrian, 1997 *Novoarbatsky Bridge (–ù–æ–≤–æ–∞—Ä–±–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1957 *Smolensky Metro Bridge (–°–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç), subway, 1937 *Borodinsky Bridge (–ë–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1912/1952/2001 *Bogdan Khmelnitsky (Kievsky) Bridge (–ú–æ—Å—Ç –ë–æ–≥–¥–∞–Ω–∞ –•–º–µ–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ü–∫–æ–≥–æ), foot, 2001 *Krasnoluzhsky Rail Bridge (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–ª—É–∂—Å–∫–∏–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), rail, 1907/2001 *Krasnoluzhsky Road Bridge (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–ª—É–∂—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Third Ring, 1998 *Luzhniki Metro Bridge (–õ—É–∂–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç), road, subway station, 1958/2001 *Andreyevsky Road Bridge (–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Third Ring, 2000 *Andreyevsky Rail Bridge (–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), rail, 2001 *Pushkinsky Bridge (–ü—É—à–∫–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), foot, 2000 *Krymsky (Crimean) Bridge (–ö—Ä—ã–º—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Garden Ring, 1938 *Demolished and not replaced: Babyegorodskaya Dam (–ë–∞–±—å–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–ª–æ—Ç–∏–Ω–∞), 1836 *Patriarshy Bridge (–ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—à–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), foot, 2004 *Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –ö–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1938 *Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, 1937 *Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –£—Å—Ç—å–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, tram, 1938 *Bolshoy Krasnokholmsky Bridge (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Ö–æ–ª–º—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Garden Ring, 1938 *Novospassky Bridge (–ù–æ–≤–æ—Å–ø–∞—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road, tram, 1911/1938/2000 *Demolished and not replaced: wooden Vsesvyatsky road bridge (road, located between Simonov Monastery and Zhukov proezd)Bridges of Moscow, 2004, p.21-22 *Avtozavodsky Bridge (–ê–≤—Ç–æ–∑–∞–≤–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç), road:Third Ring, 1961.

Both CDU/CSU and SPD achieved a similar percentage of votes at the election (35.2% and 34.2%, respectively), so they decided that each would receive eight cabinet seats (with six for the CDU and two for the CSU). On 13 October the SPD announced their future ministers and on 17 October the CDU/CSU announced theirs. Edmund Stoiber of the CSU was to become the Federal Minister of Economics and Technology, but refused the post on 1 November after a conflict with Angela Merkel over the abilities of the minister to succeed him, and chose to continue his state-level role in Bavaria. The coalition agreement (Koalitionsvertrag), titled Together for Germany. With courage and humanity, was signed and accepted by the congress of the CDU, CSU, and SPD on 12, 13, and 14 November. Angela Merkel was elected Chancellor of Germany on 22 November 2005 by 397 votes to 202.

Carolina University offers both residential and online programs including dual enrollment, undergraduate, and graduate degrees. It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), and is a member of the American Association of Christian Schools. ==History== In 1945, Charles Stevens and a group of North Carolina Baptist leaders founded Piedmont Bible Schools, Inc. and opened Piedmont Bible Institute. Three years later, the institute added two years of junior college. Although the academy associated with Piedmont Bible Schools, Inc. was discontinued in 1952, the Bible institute and the college continued. In 1956 Piedmont completed the accreditation requirements of the Accrediting Association of Bible Institutes and Bible Colleges (now The Association for Biblical Higher Education). Their acceptance allowed Religious Education and Theology bachelor's degrees to be awarded, starting in 1957, with the acceptance of the State Department of Education. The college added a graduate program in 1994 and joined the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) one year later. In 2004, Spurgeon Baptist Bible College of Mulberry, Florida merged with PIU to create Piedmont‚Äôs Spurgeon School of Online Education, which allowed several undergraduate and graduate programs to be available entirely online, including a master's degree in Biblical Studies offered in Spanish. The accreditation of two international branch campuses in restricted access nations sprang from partnerships with nationals in Asia and the Middle East. In 2012, Piedmont officially changed their name from Piedmont Baptist College and Graduate School to Piedmont International University. In the mid 2010s, three institutions were merged into Piedmont. In 2015, Tennessee Temple University of Chattanooga, Tennessee, dissolved and merged with Piedmont. Southeastern Bible College of Birmingham, Alabama closed in 2017, merging with PIU later that year. In 2018, John Wesley University, a small evangelical college approximately 19 miles from Piedmont's Winston-Salem campuses, merged with Piedmont. In 2019, PIU started partnerships collaborating with Sheriff's Offices in North Carolina and Tennessee to create a collaborative criminal justice degree program with law enforcement. On June 24, 2020, the Piedmont International University Board of Trustees voted to change the university‚Äôs name to Carolina University. The Piedmont School of Divinity (or Piedmont Divinity School) was created to \\"honor Piedmont‚Äôs historic name and heritage of training ministers and teaching Bible and theology.\\" ===Mergers and Acquisitions=== Several Christian colleges and universities have joined forces with Carolina University over the years. Spurgeon Baptist Bible College Spurgeon Baptist Bible College was established in 1970 in Lakeland, Florida as a college for training preachers and missionaries. The first president of the college was Dr. G. Arthur Woolsey, a Baptist Bible Seminary graduate. The college merged with Piedmont International University in 2003, and PIU's Spurgeon School of Online Education was created as a result of the merger. Atlantic Baptist Bible College Atlantic Baptist Bible College was located in Chester, Virginia where it served to prepare men and women for effective ministry in churches. The school merged with Piedmont International University in December, 2008. Tennessee Temple University Tennessee Temple University and Temple Baptist Seminary were located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The university opened in 1946, followed by the opening of the seminary in 1948. During the 65-year life of the school, it served over 100,000 students. TTU became the third school to merge with Piedmont International University, the process of which was completed in 2015. As a result of the merger, degree programs including Sign Language Interpretation were added to PIU's offerings. Additionally, the Temple Baptist Seminary name transitioned to Piedmont International University. The John Wesley School of Leadership was also created from TTU assets. Southeastern Bible College Southeastern Bible College was located in Birmingham, Alabama where they provided Bible, theology, ministry, and missions degree programs. The school was founded in 1935 by Edgar J. Rowe. In 2017, the school closed due to financial struggles, but after three months, SEBC merged with Piedmont International University. John Wesley University John Wesley University (located in High Point, North Carolina merged with Piedmont International University in 2018, becoming the fifth school to do so. Founded in 1903, it was the oldest undergraduate theological education institution in North Carolina. ==Academics== Carolina University comprises five undergraduate and graduate schools. * School of Arts and Sciences * Patterson School of Business * Moore School of Education * John Wesley School of Leadership * Piedmont Divinity School The School of Arts and Sciences is home to several new undergraduate programs in areas including Public Health, Esports, Information Systems, Psychology, Sociology, Criminal Justice and Interdisciplinary Studies. CU's Patterson School of Business offers both undergraduate and graduate business programs including the BBA and MBA. In addition to those programs, several concentrations are offered in areas such as Business Analytics, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management. The Moore School of Education at CU offers both undergraduate and graduate programs, in addition to five concentrations. Key programs include the BS in Deaf Studies, the BS in Elementary Education, and the Master of Education. The John Wesley School of Leadership, named as a result of the merger with John Wesley University, is home to two graduate leadership programs: the MA in Leadership and the PhD in Leadership. The Piedmont Divinity School at Carolina University comprises all the ministry and Bible-related degree programs at the university. These schools offer programs such as the 5-Year BA and MDiv, various Biblical Studies degrees, and two Graduate Certificates. ==Athletics== Carolina University athletic teams are known as the Bruins. The university participates in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) at the Division I level in the South Region. The university currently fields 11 teams. Men‚Äôs sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, and track and field. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track and field, and volleyball.

CU plans to add several more over, including the additions of men's volleyball and women's cheerleading in 2020‚Äì21. The university also moved the athletics department from NCCAA Division II to the Division I level and added athletic scholarship opportunities. One notable former coach is Josh Howard, a former NBA All-Star player and Dallas Mavericks player, Howard got his start in collegiate coaching as the CU men's basketball head coach from 2016-2020. ==References== ==External links == * Official website * Official athletics website Category:Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools Category:Seminaries and theological colleges in North Carolina Category:Baptist Christianity in North Carolina Category:Bible colleges Category:Educational institutions established in 1945 Category:Universities and colleges in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:1945 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"Carolina University"},{"id":"9094776","text":"Antoinette Martignoni (born Antoinette Bremner Walker December 8, 1918 ‚Äì August 20, 2018) was an American artist who developed the \\"Inner Portrait\\" process that uses art as a self-help means to see hidden personal potential. Martignoni died in August 2018 at the age of 99.Notice of cremationAntoinette Martignoni obituary == Family == Born as Antoinette B. Walker in Brooklyn, New York in December 1918, she was the great-granddaughter of James McCune Smith, the first African-American medical doctor with a university degree in the United States. == Education == Martignoni was the first graduate to receive the Applied Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941. In addition, she received a Diploma in Illustration from the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as the University of the Arts (Philadelphia). == Illustration career == She was a creative director and partner at Koelling/Martignoni & Co., Westport, Connecticut, and later founder of Martignoni & Co., a graphics and illustration firm in Fairfield, Connecticut. Martignoni created illustrations for large United States corporations (such as Avis Rent A Car System, Pepsi, H. J. Heinz Company, Nabisco and Duracell). As an illustrator for some of the top engineering firms from the 1960s through the 1980s, Martignoni produced illustrations of futuristic engineering projects, such as the Boston Tunnel that became known as the Big Dig and America‚Äôs first people mover that was built at the West Virginia University. In 1973, Martignoni illustrated an instructional woodworking book by author Carolyn Meyer, Saw, Hammer, and Paint: Woodworking and Finishing for Beginners. == Involved in personal growth and development == Involved in the Pathwork process developed by John Pierrakos. From its beginning in the 1960s, Martignoni was present at many of the lectures channeled by Eva Broch Pierrakos. Martignoni explored EST which became Landmark Education in the 1980s and was in charge of assistants in Connecticut. She was a member of the Albertson Memorial Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. As an artist Martignoni sought ways to unite human potential with art. She explored Zen drawing classes with therapist and poet Gunilla Norris and practiced a form of Painting from the Source, as created by Aviva Gold, with a group of women artists. Influenced by writers Frederick Franck (The Zen of Seeing), Caroline Myss (Anatomy of Spirit) and Julia Cameron (The Artist‚Äôs Way), Martignoni began to use the power of art to connect people with their potential. In 1993 she drew her first Inner Portrait at age 74. == Inner portrait artist == Martignoni has drawn more than 700 Inner Portraits since 1993. The portraits are in an illustrative style in which people and shapes are easily recognizable with a sub-text of hidden symbols and images.

Somewhat like continental slopes, ocean banks slopes can upwell as tidal and other flows intercept them, resulting sometimes in nutrient rich currents. Because of this, some large banks, such as Dogger Bank and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, are among the richest fishing grounds in the world. There are some banks that were reported in the 19th century by navigators, such as Wachusett Reef, whose existence is doubtful. ==Types== Ocean banks may be of volcanic nature. Banks may be carbonate or terrigenous. In tropical areas some banks are submerged atolls. As they are not associated with any landmass, banks have no outside source of sediments. Carbonate banks are typically platforms, rising from the ocean depths, whereas terrigenous banks are elevated sedimentary deposits.Morelock, J. (2005). Morphology.

Bolli Bollason (also Bolli Bollison) was a key historical character in the Medieval Icelandic Laxd√¶la saga, born around 1000. He grew up in Orlygsstadir, at Helgafell on the Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. He divided his time between Helgafell and Tunga, the home of Snorri the Go√∞i. He was held in the highest regard among the contemporary Scandinavian rulers, and also in the Eastern Roman Empire. It is believed that he had reached the rank of manglabites in the Eastern Roman army,Heath, p 38 and on his return to Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name \\"Bolli the Elegant\\".Thorsson, p 419 His importance in the literary context of the saga is his prominence as the son of Bolli √ûorleiksson and Gu√∞r√∫n √ìsv√≠fursd√≥ttir, the two central characters of the work. He is mentioned at the end of the Sneglu-Hall √æ√°ttur (The Tale of Sarcastic Halli), and is also the subject of his own tale, the Bolla√æ√°ttur, which was later appended to the end of the manuscripts in the early 14th century. ==Laxd√¶la sagaBackground=== A page of Nj√°l's saga from the M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k, the same vellum manuscript containing the Laxd√¶la saga and the Bolla√æ√°ttur The Laxd√¶la saga or Saga of the People of Laxardal is an Icelandic family saga written sometime between 1250 and 1270, possibly by a woman author.Thorsson, p 270Thorsson, p 274-275 \\"Vast in conception\\", the grand sweep of the saga's action spans well over a century from AD 890 to 1030. Alongside Nj√°l's saga and Egil's saga, the Laxd√¶la saga makes the strongest claim of any Icelandic saga for literary greatness.Thorsson, p xii Shaped by continental literary traditions and several types of saga, the characterisation \\"highlights nobility, splendour and physical appearance\\", although: The saga is also a feud saga, in which \\"feuds escalate from trivial local squabbles into unstoppable vendettas. The male protagonists are splendid figures who die heroic deaths, while the women are strong characters who engineer much of the action\\".Thorsson, p lxi Many manuscripts of the Laxd√¶la saga have survived, although all printed versions have been based upon the M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k (dated 1330-1370), the only intact vellum manuscript.Thorsson, p 275 Historiographically, the distinction between narrative and history did not exist at the time when the sagas were written.Thorsson, p xxx However, the sagas develop a \\"dense and plausible\\" historical context,Thorsson, p xxxv with the authenticating detailsThorsson, p xxvii and precision necessary for the narrative.Thorsson, p xxxvii The world within which the local and detailed stories of the individual sagas exist can be confirmed by archaeology and comparison with histories in other languages.Thorsson, p xxxi ===Account=== Family and early life Sn√¶fellsnes, where Bolli was born. Bolli Bollason was one of the People of Lax√°rdalur, in the Western Quarter of Iceland. He was born in 1006 to Gu√∞r√∫n √ìsv√≠fursd√≥ttir, the winter after the killing of his father, Bolli √ûorleiksson. Gu√∞r√∫n had been courted by Bolli √ûorleiksson and his foster-brother Kjartan √ìlafsson, but although she preferred Kjartan, she gave herself to Bolli √ûorleiksson on the basis of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged. The consequent hostilities between the two foster-brothers ended with Bolli √ûorleiksson killing Kjartan, and then he in turn being killed by Kjartan's kinsmen. Bolli Bollason grew up with his brother Thorleik, who was four years his senior, and his mother Gu√∞r√∫n in Helgafell, after she exchanged homes with the renowned Snorri the Go√∞i. Gu√∞r√∫n remarried, this time to Thorkell Eyjolffsson, who became a great chieftain in his own countryside and took over the running of the household at Helgafell. This left Bolli able to spend his time both at Helgafell and with Snorri in Tunga, and Snorri became very fond of him. Thorkell was fond of both his stepsons, but Bolli was regarded as \\"being the foremost in all things\\". Thorleik journeyed abroad to Norway, and stayed with King Olaf II for several months. When Bolli was eighteen years old he asked for his father's portion, as he intended to woo Thordis Snorradottir, the daughter of Snorri Go√∞i. He set out with his stepfather and a good many followers to Tunga. Snorri welcomed them, and the wedding feast took place that summer. Bolli abode at Tunga, and love grew between him and Thordis. The next summer, Thorleik returned in a goods-laden ship to White-river, \\"and the brothers greeted each other joyfully\\". The two brothers made peace with the sons of √ìlaf, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the Thorness Thing; it is not known how much money was exchanged in compensation as part of the agreement, but Bolli received a good sword, and after the assembly \\"both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs\\". Travels abroad cog of the type that Bolli might have taken to Denmark. Bolli's later travels abroad with his brother Thorleik are well documented and notable for his role in the Varangian Guard. They departed Iceland, taking \\"a great deal of money abroad with him\\", and reached Norway in the autumn. They stayed in Thrandheim for the winter, while King Olaf II was wintering in the east in Sarpsborg. Bolli soon became highly thought of in Norway, and his arrivals at the guild meeting- places were noted for being better arrayed as to raiment and weapons than other townsfolk. Early in the spring the brothers prepared their ship and went east to meet the king. The king thought Bolli \\"a man of high mettle,\\" \\"even peerless among men\\", and \\"the man of greatest mark that has ever come from Iceland.\\" Bolli boarded a trade-ship bound for Denmark, departing King Olaf in great friendship and with fine parting gifts.[Note 2] Thorleik remained behind, but Bolli wintered in Denmark and became as well regarded as he had been in Norway. Travelling next to Constantinople, he spent many years in the Varangian Guard; \\"and was thought to be the most valiant in all deeds that try a man, and always went next to those in the forefront.\\" The saga also records the finery his followers received from the Roman Emperor (most likely Romanos III), and the influence he held after his return to Iceland, some time after the death of King Olaf II:Thorsson The right to bear a gold-hilted sword was one of the privileges of the court rank of manglabites, and is taken as an indicator that Bolli held this rank. In Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name \\"Bolli the Elegant\\". His return to Thordis was joyful, and he took over the manor of Tunga when Snorri died at 67 years of age. Bolli had two children with Thordis: Herdis Bolladottir and Ospak Bollason. ==TalesBolla√æ√°ttur=== The Althing at √ûingvellir, which Bolli attended the same year he killed Thorolf Stuck-up In Norse literature, a tale or √æ√°ttur referred to a short narrative often included as an episode in a larger whole, such as part of a saga.Thorsson, p 757 The Bolla √æ√°ttur Bollasonar, or Bolli Bollason's Tale, is such a narrative about an episode in the life of Bolli Bollason, taken from the 14th century M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k which contains the Laxd√¶la saga.Thorsson, p 422 According to the tale, a man called Thorolf Stuck-up had a bull which wounded his neighbours' farm animals, damaged haystacks and caused \\"a great deal of trouble\\". When an upstanding local farmer named Thord saw the bull damaging the stacks of peat on his farm at Marbaeli, he lunged at the animal with a spear and struck it dead.Thorsson, p 422-423 In revenge, Thorolf killed Thord's seven- or eight-year-old son Olaf, to the disgust of Thorolf's wife and kinsmen.Thorsson, p 423 Thorolf fled and eventually secured the protection of Thorvald Hjaltasson, a prominent leader who lived at Hjaltadal.Thorsson, p 422-424 After Christmas, Thorvald secured for him the safekeeping and support of Starri of Guddalir, who often sheltered outlaws.Thorsson, p 424-425 Thord's wife Gudrun, a first cousin of Bolli, asked him to take over the prosecution of the case.Thorsson, p 424 Accompanied by Arnor Crone's-nose and a large company of men, Bolli attended the Hegranes Assembly.Thorsson, p 425 Thorvald and Starri intended to block the prosecution \\"by force of arms and numbers\\", but when they realised they were outnumbered, they withdrew and Bolli successfully had Thorolf outlawed. Passage out of Iceland was obtained for Thorolf aboard a merchant vessel at Hrutafjord.Thorsson, p 426 However, Bolli believed it would have been improper if the outlawed Thorolf were to escape, and having ridden north to Hrutafjord, he drew his sword Leg-biter and \\"struck a blow right through\\" Thorolf, killing him. ===Sneglu-Halla √æ√°ttr=== Bolli died during the reign of Harald III of Norway, as is recorded at the end of The Tale of Sarcastic Halli. The tale makes reference to Bolli's military prowess, in ironic contrast to the tale's protagonist: ==Notes== ==Footnotes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Translation in English by Muriel Press (The Temple Classics, London, 1899) *Text with modern Icelandic spelling *Laxd√¶la saga in an English translation by Muriel A.

High Court rejected his review petition on 18 November 2015. == Early life == Mojaheed was born in 1948, in Faridpur district. His father, Mohammad Ali, an Islamic scholar, was a member of the Peace Committee during the Liberation War with alleged involvement in crimes against humanity. After the liberation of Bangladesh, he was acquitted by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from trials on request of local Awami League leaders. After completing schooling from Faridpur, Mojaheed took admission to the Dhaka University in 1970. == Political career  During the Liberation war === In 1968, Mojaheed became the Faridpur district president of Islami Chhatra Sangha (Urdu: Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba). In 1970, he took admission at the Dhaka University. On moving to Dhaka, he became the Dhaka district president of the Islami Chhatra Sangha. Around August‚ÄìSeptember 1970 Mojaheed became the Secretary of the East Pakistan Islami Chhatra Sangha, the provincial wing of the Nikhil Pakistan Islami Chhatra Sangha. In October 1971, he was elected the president of East Pakistan Islami Chhatra Sangha. On 17 October, Mojaheed addressed an Islami Chhatra Sangha meeting at Rangpur, where he directed the students to join the Al Badar. The prosecutors at the International Crimes Tribunal in their formal charge stated that Mojaheed took over as the supreme commander of the Al Badar forces from Motiur Rahman Nizami in October 1971. He was accused by the prosecution of having led a group that looted around 300‚Äì350 Hindu houses and killed around 50‚Äì60 Hindus in May 1971. On the occasion Mojaheed put forward a four-point declaration. He allegedly stated that he did not recognise Hindustan as a sovereign state. The Al Badr shall not rest till Hindustan is erased from the map of the world. He also allegedly forbade the selling, publicising or keeping books either written by the Hindus or written in favour of them. === Post war === Mojaheed contested the parliamentary elections in 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2008. Except for 2001, he lost in all the elections. Between 2001 and 2006, he was the Minister of Social Welfare. ==War crimes trialProsecution=== The trial of Mojaheed at the International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh began on 19 July 2012. On 11 December 2011, the prosecution submitted before the tribunal, pressing 34 counts of charges against Mojaheed. The tribunal indicted Mojaheed on two counts of genocide against the Bengali Hindus and five counts of crimes against humanity for killing, forced deportation, abduction, torture and arson. Among the victims listed in the charges was Serajuddin Hossain, who was the executive editor of The Daily Ittefaq in 1971. Opposition parties and human rights groups alleged political interference in the trial, given that all the accused were leading opposition politicians. ICT have delivered its verdict on war crimes charges of Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed on 17 July 2013, two days after ICT-1 sentenced war criminal Ghulam Azam to 90 years in prison. ===Skype controversy=== In late 2012, the ICT was the centre of a controversy after Skype conversations and e-mails between the head judge, Nizamul Huq and Ahmed Ziauddin, a Brussels-based lawyer were leaked. According to The Economist, the recordings and emails suggested that the Bangladesh Government pressured and attempted to intervene in the International Crimes Tribunal to speed proceedings up. The neutrality and independence of Huq was also called into question, as Ziauddin appeared to help him to prepare documents for the tribunal and make detailed recommendations for Huq, and informed Huq about how the prosecutors may develop their case while in contact with the prosecution. Nizamul Huq later resigned from the post of head judge of the tribunal. ===Conviction=== On 17 July 2013, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed was found guilty of war crimes such as genocide, conspiracy in killing intellectuals, torture and abduction during 1971 Liberation war of Bangladesh by the International Crimes Tribunal-2 and was sentenced to death for 2 of the 5 charges brought against him. Mujaheed was found guilty on the charge related to the killing of Rumi, Badi, Jewel, Azad and Altaf Mahmud at the army camp set up in Nakhalpara, Dhaka, during the Liberation War. Defence lawyer Abdur Razzaq claimed that this verdict was unfair. On 14 October 2015, Ahsan filed a review petition with the Supreme Court of Bangladesh against the sentence. On 18 November 2015, the High Court of Bangladesh upheld the death sentence of Ali Ahsan, rejecting his pleas for reviewing death penalties. According to jail officials and the Minister for Justice, Mojaheed asked for mercy in a petition to the President of Bangladesh, but his appeal was rejected. Although, his family claimed that he didn't ask for mercy to the president and it was a lie from the government. == Death == On 22 November 2015, 12:45 AM, GMT+6, Mojaheed was hanged at Dhaka Central Jail. The execution was reported by the Minister for Justice, Anisul Huq. At the same time and place, another Bangladeshi politician, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, was hanged for war crime charges. Ahsan was buried at his hometown Faridpur after his namaz-e-janaza had held on Adarsha Academy's Ideal Madrasa ground at West Khabaspur of the town. === Reactions ===  Domestic reactions  Ahsan's party Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami offered funeral prayers in absentia on 22 November morning, and called for a strike across the country on 23 November 2015. Thirteen treasury bench of the Jatiyo Sangshad praised and congratulating the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for executing the two top war criminals of Bangladesh Liberation war.  International reactions  \\\\- In a statement from Pakistan Foreign Ministry said after the execution, \\"We have noted with deep concern and anguish the unfortunate executions of the Bangladesh National Party Leader, Mr Salauddin Quadir Chowdhury, and Mr Ali Ahsan Mojaheed.

The sorority is now present in over 50 campuses. Though Latina-based, Sigma Lambda Upsilon Sorority, Inc. is a non-discriminatory organization. ==Philanthropy== Historically, the organization has worked with children and youth as the primary target population to aid in literacy in education and career success. In the early 1990s, there was much interest centered on bilingualism in the classroom and the high illiteracy rates across America. At age four, Latino children tend to have less developed school-related skills than their caucasian counterparts. By age nine, It was found that Latino students tend to lag behind in reading, mathematics, and science proficiency. Thus, in the spring of 2000, the Sorority decided to focus its efforts and funding on literacy. The Sorority advocates for literacy as a means of ensuring the empowerment and success of our nation and the people of its diverse communities. They encourage literacy as an activity that affords limitless possibilities and promotes reading and writing as enjoyable, exciting, and empowering. Literacy is more than just reading. It‚Äôs the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, computer and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy can be expanded to include many areas such as: financial literacy, technological literacy, health literacy and more. The premise of their philanthropic work focuses on the power of literacy to uplift their communities and foster confidence in their young people, for them to advance toward their educational, personal, and professional goals. ==Mentoring programs== Sigma Lambda Upsilon's national mentoring initiatives are the Leadership, Advancement, and Development of our Young Sisters (LADYS) and Promoting Education, the Arts, our Roots, Leadership and Service (PEARLS) programs. ==Awards & recognition== Sigma Lambda Upsilon Sorority, Inc. has been recognized by the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) for the Sorority‚Äôs outstanding commitment to academic and professional excellence, as well as, continuous philanthropic efforts. ==Undergraduate chapters== Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Se√±oritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc. has 43 chapters at over 60 Colleges and Universities: *Alpha chapter - Binghamton University *Beta chapter - Buffalo State College, University at Buffalo, Daemen College *Gamma chapter - University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Bryn Mawr College, Drexel University, St. Joseph‚Äôs University *Delta chapter - Brown University *Epsilon chapter - State University of New York at Cortland *Zeta chapter - State University of New York at Oswego *Eta chapter - Syracuse University *Iota chapter - Cornell University, Ithaca College *Kappa chapter - Princeton University *Lambda chapter - Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey *Mu chapter - University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, College of Saint Rose *Nu chapter - Pennsylvania State University *Xi chapter - University of Rhode Island *Omicron chapter - New York University, City College-CUNY, Baruch College-CUNY, St. Francis College, Lehman College-CUNY *Pi chapter - Yale University *Rho chapter - Johnson and Wales University *Sigma chapter - Union College *Tau chapter - Rutgers University-Newark *Upsilon chapter - University of Maryland, College Park *Phi chapter - University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Smith College, Hampshire College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College *Chi chapter - Boston University, Tufts University, Brandeis University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology *Psi chapter - University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. John Fisher College, Nazareth College *Omega chapter - Old Dominion University *Alpha Alpha chapter - Columbia University, Barnard College *Alpha Beta chapter - Dartmouth College *Alpha Gamma chapter - George Washington University *Alpha Delta chapter - State University of New York at Stony Brook *Alpha Epsilon chapter - State University of New York at Plattsburgh *Alpha Zeta chapter - Virginia Commonwealth University *Alpha Eta chapter - Indiana University at Bloomington *Alpha Theta chapter - Wesleyan University *Alpha Iota chapter - Hamilton College *Alpha Kappa chapter - Adelphi University *Alpha Lambda chapter - Montclair State University *Alpha Mu chapter - State University of New York at New Paltz *Alpha Nu chapter - Grand Valley State University *Alpha Xi chapter - Pace University- Pleasantville *Alpha Omicron chapter - University of Connecticut-Storrs *Alpha Pi chapter - Georgia State University *Alpha Rho chapter - University of Virginia-Charlottesville *Alpha Sigma chapter - Farmingdale State College *Alpha Tau chapter - James Madison University ==Graduate chapters== *Theta Alpha - New York City, NY *Theta Beta - Providence, RI *Theta Gamma - Albany, NY *Theta Delta - Texas *Theta Epsilon - Buffalo, NY *Theta Zeta - Philadelphia, PA *Theta Eta - New Jersey *Theta Theta - DC/Maryland/Northern Virginia *Theta Iota - Florida *Theta Kappa - California *Theta Lambda - Harrisburg, PA *Theta Mu - Boston, MA *Theta Nu - OH / MI / IN / IL *Theta Xi - Rochester, NY *Theta Omicron - Westchester, NY *Theta Pi - Atlanta, GA *Theta Rho - Long Island, NY *Theta Sigma - Southern VA ==References== *National website *NALFO ==External links== *National website Category:1987 establishments in New York (state) Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Latino fraternities and sororities Category:Student organizations established in 1987 Category:National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations ","title":"Sigma Lambda Upsilon"},{"id":"9095000","text":"The SH-3A is a monophonic analog synthesizer that was manufactured by Roland from 1975 to 1981.

Bush, on Tuesday, January 20, 2004, at 9 p.m. EST, in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives to the 108th United States Congress. It was Bush's third State of the Union Address and his fourth speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, accompanied by Dick Cheney, the Vice President of the United States. The speech was given 28 months after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. ==TopicsWar on Terror=== President Bush begins by saying that the greatest responsibility of the government is to protect all Americans from terroristic threats. He also highlighted that several years had passed since the terrorist attacks on September the 11th. While several years had passed \\"without an attack on American soil\\", it did not mean that all of the danger was in the past. After September 11, attacks continued around the world in Bali, Jerusalem, Baghdad, and other major regions of the world. The President also focuses on how enemies of the United States are constantly plotting attacks of some form or another. The Patriot Act was mentioned as a point of emphasis for giving the United States Department of Homeland Security all of the necessary resources to find criminals and locate possible attack scenarios. One of the recurring themes of the speech was that \\"America is on the offensive\\" and is constantly on the hunt for members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. President Bush then proceeded to discuss how American allies helped to convince several countries to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. ===Troops in the Middle East=== President Bush talks about the evolution of the Iraqi people since the American intervention and overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. He talked about how the Iraqis have started down the road of complete independence. They slowly accepted responsibility for organizing their own security once the Americans decide to withdraw, whenever that may be. He also talks about how democracy is slowly taking shape in Iraq thanks to Americans always having a desire to do what is considered \\"right\\". At one point during the speech, the President gave thanks to the troops and families of troops stationed all across the world and assured that they would have every resource necessary to succeed overseas. He also reaffirmed that as long as the Middle East continued to be a place where American resentment was present, America would have a presence there, working to transform the area into one of peace towards the United States. ===Economy=== The primary emphasis of the President's portion of his speech on the economy was geared towards the accomplishments of the American people. He thanks the American people for giving tax relief to help stimulate the economy. He also continued to use the personal pronoun \\"you\\" when talking about American successes in areas like cutting taxes for small businesses, phasing out the estate tax, and lowering taxes for all citizens who pay income taxes. He ends the economic talk by stating that the economy is always changing, as is the technology, and how new jobs and skills are needed constantly. ===Education=== President Bush's main focus of the talks on education were the effects of the No Child Left Behind Act. He again used the pronoun \\"you\\" when talking about the recent successes in education. The President also stated that since 2001, a 36 percent increase in funding for schools took place, as well as an elevation in standards and communication between schools and parents. He followed by saying that the days of shuffling kids along without knowing if they understood what was necessary were over as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act. ===Other topics=== Taxes The President's discussion of taxes was centered on the fact that the tax reforms were about to expire, and unless Congress were to do something about it, taxes would jump to a higher level. Energy The President's discussion of energy was primarily asking Congress to pass new legislature that would modernize electricity and increase conservation. Immigration The President proposed a new immigration reform that consisted of giving American citizens priority in being hired for jobs. If no willing Americans could be found for the job, then they would go to foreign workers to help create an even workforce. He also states his opposition for amnesty because it would encourage more people to illegally immigrate to America and break laws. Healthcare President Bush talked about the rapid evolution of medical technology and how costs for healthcare with these new technologies was on the rise. He campaigned for Congress to again work together to help keep the costs of health insurance as low as possible. He stated that his primary goal for healthcare is to give all Americans the opportunity to have affordable private healthcare that tailors to their specific needs. He also focuses on the benefits of computerizing medical records and the adverse effects of a government run healthcare system. \\"Right choices\\" President Bush focused on the youth of the nation and them making \\"right choices\\" in life. He talked about the negative impact of children gambling away their lives with drugs and how he wanted Congress to send extra funding to schools to use for drug testing to save lives. He also talked about how large a part of American society sports are, but yet there are a multitude of less than positive influences in professional sports. The President also wanted to increase funding to make sexual contraceptives easier to acquire for younger people. He also refers to the Defense of Marriage Act and how it needs to be adhered to help influence children more positively and for the benefit of every American citizen. Religious institutions The President talked about how religious charities and organizations, no matter what creed, do important charity work in communities across the country. He pointed out the fact that the government denied many of these groups of grants for charity work, but he made available large amounts of money for these groups to continue their charitable work. ==Democratic Party response== Democrats opposed President Bush's foreign policies. They believed that America could only go so far on its own and needed to rely on other countries to \\"meet common dangers\\". They accused the President of being too radical in going to war with Iraq, as well as dropping the cost of war on the American people by taxing them more than necessary. Democrats also supported removing troops from the Middle East, whereas President Bush wanted to leave them there to have a presence in an area seen as dangerous by the American government. Democrats also wanted to increase the inspection rate of cargo going in and out of airports and harbors across the country to increase civil liberties, something which President Bush opposed. The tax cuts that the President had made were heavily opposed by Democrats, as well. They also said that the President did not hold up his end of the deal in the No Child Left Behind Act. ==See also== *2004 United States presidential election ==References== ==External links== * (full transcript), The American Presidency Project, UC Santa Barbara *Entire 2004 State of the Union Address (video) at C-SPAN *Entire 2004 State of the Union Response (video) at C-SPAN *Audio of Bush's Third State of the Union Address State of the Union Address 2004 State of the Union Address State of the Union Address State of the Union Address State of the Union Address State of the Union Address Category:Presidency of George W.

Thomas Yellowtail's adult life was dedicated to the adherence to, and preservation of, the Sun Dance religion., Retrieved 10 June 2016. ==Early reservation life== Thomas Yellowtail was born just south of Lodge Grass, Montana, on the Crow Indian reservation.U. Idaho.edu, Rodney Frey His father's name was Hawk with the Yellow Tail Feathers. It was the practice at the time for the U.S. Government to assign surnames to the Indians as a means of assimilating them into the white culture and to ease record keeping. Thus, the child of Hawk with the Yellow Tail Feathers and his wife was given the last name Yellowtail. In Yellowtail‚Äôs younger days, the old, great warriors who participated in the Plains Wars and had lived the traditional nomadic life of their people were still living, although they had been forced onto the reservations. Yellowtail often recalled seeing the old warriors as they sat around the camp fires and performed sacred ceremonies.Native spirit info ==Spiritual influences== The Lodge Grass valley was called the \\"Valley of the Chiefs\\" because of all the great war chiefs who lived there in Yellowtail‚Äôs early years. When he was only six years old, Yellowtail received a great honor when one of the Crow Nation‚Äôs most famous chiefs, Medicine Crow, gave Yellowtail his Indian name, Medicine Rock Chief. Receiving a name from such a famous chief was all the more significant as the name came from Chief Medicine Crow's personal spiritual medicine. Yellowtail‚Äôs youth was shaped by these elders who had lived the traditional nomadic life. These ‚Äúold timers‚Äù as Yellowtail called them, taught him to know and to love the traditional spirituality of his ancestors. Yellowtail‚Äôs character was shaped by those traditional elders and he often said that it is those same traditional spiritual values which should be at the center of our lives today. In contrast, the United States Government tried to crush the Indian‚Äôs ancestral traditions. Various laws (United States Secretary of the Interior's order of 1884) prohibited many traditional ceremonies, such as the Sun Dance for almost 50 years.New York Times , Obituaries, December 7, 1993 During this same time, the reservation children, including Yellowtail, were taken from their homes and forced into government boarding schools. At those boarding schools the children were forbidden to speak their own language, had to wear white man's clothing and cut their hair. Simultaneously, almost every Christian denomination opened churches on or near the reservations and actively tried to convert the Indians away from their own traditions. On the Crow reservation each family was arbitrarily assigned to become a member of one of the churches. ==Return of the Sun Dance to the Crow Tribe== The Crow tribe did not perform their ancestral Sun Dance during the fifty year prohibition by the U.S. Government. When the Sun Dance became legal again in 1934, the original Crow Sun Dance was a forgotten memory and could not be resurrected. The Shoshone tribe had periodically performed their ancestral Sun Dance during the prohibition without the knowledge of the bureaucracy in Washington. When the prohibition ended, John Trehero, a Shoshone medicine man, emerged as the preeminent Shoshone Sun Dance chief. The Crow tribe asked John Trehero to help them lead a Sun Dance on the Crow Reservation in the early 1940s. This was the beginning of the revival of the Sun Dance on the Crow Reservation. Starting in 1943, Thomas Yellowtail became a sincere Sun Dancer, participating in the annual Sun Dance and monthly prayer meetings. Over the next twenty years, Yellowtail deepened his relationship with the Great Spirit through his daily practice of prayer, purification in the sweat lodge and periodic vision quests. ==Medicine Man and Sun Dance Chief== In 1963, John Trehero informed Yellowtail that his Medicine Fathers had instructed him to transfer the authority to run the Crow Sun Dance over to Yellowtail. For the next thirty years, until his death at age 90, Yellowtail served as Crow Sun Dance chief and helped perpetuate the Crow Sun Dance Religion. At the time of his death in November, 1993, Thomas Yellowtail was one of the most respected and revered Sun Dance chiefs and Medicine Men of the Crow tribe. ==Preserving the old ways== Yellowtail wanted every American Indian to learn about the spiritual traditions of their ancestors. While many of those traditions have been lost, Yellowtail believed that what remains is sufficient to constitute a valid spiritual path - what he called the Sun Dance Religion. Yellowtail counseled the Native Americans who sought his guidance to follow the way of the Vision Quest, sweat lodge, and Daily Prayer with the Pipe under the guidance of a legitimate Sun Dance Chief. He encouraged American Indian youth to learn the language of their tribe and to seek out the spiritual leaders who followed the traditional ceremonies of their people. Thomas Yellowtail wrote his autobiography as a means of preserving the ancient spiritual traditions he held sacred for future generations. Thomas Yellowtail was a member of that pivotal generation that made the wrenching cultural transition into a new and bewildering world, while never forgetting the old ways. He, and many others across the plains tribes, held fast to the spiritual legacy of their ancestors, insuring that the ways of his Grandfathers would not be lost. ==Bibliography== * Yellowtail Crow Medicine Man and Sun Dance Chief, an autobiography as told to Michael Oren Fitzgerald, University of Oklahoma Press, 1991. * Native Spirit and the Sun Dance Way, by Thomas Yellowtail, World Wisdom 2007. ==Film== *Native Spirit and the Sun Dance Way, DVD documentary based on the memoirs of Thomas Yellowtail, 2007, World Wisdom. ==Resource materials== * Companion Book to Native Spirit and the Sun Dance DVD ==References== ==External links== *Obituary in the New York Times *Author Page with slideshows *Rodney Frey's page on Yellowtail *Native Spirit's page on Yellowtail * Category:1903 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Big Horn County, Montana Category:Religious figures of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Crow tribe Category:American animists ","title":"Thomas Yellowtail"},{"id":"9095058","text":"Loch Arkaig in Lochaber. The treasure of Loch Arkaig, sometimes known as the Jacobite gold, was a large amount of specie provided by Spain to finance the Jacobite rising in Scotland in 1745, and rumoured still to be hidden at Loch Arkaig in Lochaber. ==Background== In 1745, Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) arrived in Scotland from France and claimed the thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland, in the name of his father James Stuart (the Old Pretender). Although Charles asserted that his venture was supported by Louis XV of France, and that the arrival of French forces in Scotland was imminent, in truth France had little intention to intervene on the Stuarts' behalf. However, some limited financial support was supplied by both Spain and the Pope. Spain pledged some 400,000 livres (or Louis d'Or) per month for the Jacobite cause. However, getting this money to the rebel army was the difficulty. The first instalment (sent via Charles' brother Henry who was resident in France) was dispatched in 1745. The French sloop Hazard (renamed the Prince Charles) successfully landed its monies on the west coast of Scotland. Unfortunately for the Jacobites, the riches were soon captured by Clan Mackay, who were loyal to King George II,Bonnie Prince Charlie: A Biography, Kybett, Sunan McLean Unwin 1988 pp. 192‚Äì193. in the Skirmish of Tongue.Simpson, Peter.

The Independent Highland Companies, 1603‚Äì1760. pp. 135. . ==Treasure arrives== Prince \\"Charlie\\" later accused MacPherson of embezzlement In April 1746, the ships Mars and Bellona arrived in Scotland with 1,200,000 livres (another Spanish instalment, plus a large French supplement). However, on learning of the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April, the ships left, unloading only the Spanish money at Loch nan Uamh, Arisaig on 30 AprilBonnie Prince Charlie: A Biography, Kybett, Sunan McLean Unwin 1988 pp. 216‚Äì217. (the same place from where the prince had disembarked the year before, and would later embark for France). Thus, seven caskets of Spanish gold arrived in Scotland. As the Jacobite cause was by then lost, with the army scattered and the prince and his lieutenants in hiding, the money was to be used to assist the Jacobite clansmen (then being subjected to the brutalities of the government forces of the Duke of CumberlandA History of Scotland, Mackie, J. D., Penguin 1964 p.274) and to facilitate the escape of leading Jacobites to the continent. Six caskets (one having been stolen by McDonaldMacDonald of Barisdale had a torture engine referred to as a Barisdale engine. Search for Barisdale of Barrisdale's men) were brought to Loch Arkaig (just north of Fort William) and hidden. Their secret was entrusted to Murray of Broughton, one of the Jacobite fugitives. Murray began the distribution to clan chiefs, but when he was apprehended by the government (and later turned state's evidence)Gazetter for Scotland. the treasure was entrusted first to Lochiel, the chief of Clan Cameron, and then to Macpherson of Cluny, head of Clan Macpherson. Cluny was hiding in a cave at Ben Alder, which came to be known as \\"the cage\\",The story of \\"Cluny's Cage\\" was later immortalised in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Kidnapped. and when Charles briefly joined him there, Cluny had control of the money, which was still hidden at Arkaig. ==Treasure hunt== Archibald Cameron of Lochiel (1707‚Äì1753) ‚Äî a Jacobite treasure hunter who paid with his life Charles finally escaped Scotland in the French frigate L'Heureux and arrived back in France in September 1746. However, the fate of the money is not as clear. Cluny is believed to have retained control of it, and during his long years as a fugitive was at the centre of various futile plots to finance another uprising. Indeed, he remained in hiding in his Highland \\"cage\\" for the next eight years.Cluny McPherson on 'Virtual Scotland '. Meanwhile, a cash-strapped Charles was constantly looking for his money and at least some of it came to him later, paying for the minting of a campaign medal in the 1750s. However, it is said that all of the gold was never recovered.Bonnie Prince Charlie: A biography, Kybett, Sunan McLean Unwin 1988 pp. 245‚Äì247. Charles, years later, accused Cluny of embezzlement.Bonnie Prince Charlie: A Biography, Kybett, Sunan McLean Unwin 1988 p. 245. Whatever the case, the gold became a source of discord and grievance among the surviving Jacobites. In 1753, Archibald Cameron‚ÄîLochiel's brother, who was acting as secretary to the Old Pretender‚Äîwas sent back to Scotland to locate the treasure. However, whilst staying secretly at Brenachyle by Loch Katrine, he was betrayed (apparently by the notorious \\"Pickle\\", a Hanoverian spy) and arrested. He was charged under the Act of Attainder for his part in the 1745 uprising and sentenced to death, being drawn and then hanged on 7 June 1753, at TyburnThe history of Clan Cameron. (the last Jacobite to be executed). The trail then goes cold. However, the Stuarts' papers (now in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II) record a host of claims, counter-claims and accusations among the Highland chiefs and Jacobites in exile, as to the fate of the monies. The historian Andrew Lang (who was one of the first people to research the papers since Walter Scott secured them for the crown) recorded, in his book Pickle the Spy (1897),'Pickles the Spy' at Project Gutenberg. the sordid tale, and the involvement of both the prince and his father in trying to locate the monies. The Stuart papers also include an account from around 1750, drawn up in Rome by Archibald Cameron, which indicates that Cluny had not or could not account for all of it.Dr. Archibald Cameron's Memorial Concerning the Locharkaig Treasure (Stuart Papers, Vol. 300, No. 80) transcript available in the Clan Cameron archives.

They function to invert the effects of other molecules. The effects of antagonists can be seen after they have encountered an agonist, and as a result, the effects of the agonist is neutralized. Antagonists such as dopamine antagonist slow down movement in lab rats. Although they hinder the joining of enzymes to substrates, Antagonists can be beneficial. For example, not only do angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors work to lower blood pressure, but they also counter the effects of renal disease in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Chelating agents, such as calcium di sodium defeated, fall into the category of antagonists and operate to minimize the lethal effects of heavy metals such as mercury or lead. In chemistry, antagonism is a phenomenon wherein two or more agents in combination have an overall effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects. The word is most commonly used in this context in biochemistry and toxicology: interference in the physiological action of a chemical substance by another having a similar structure. For instance, a receptor antagonist is an agent that reduces the response that a ligand produces when the receptor antagonist binds to a receptor on a cell. An example of this is the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. The opposite of antagonism is synergy. It is a negative type of synergism. Experiments with different combinations show that binary mixtures of phenolics can lead to either a synergetic antioxidant effect or to an antagonistic effect. == References == Category:Toxicology Category:Receptor antagonists ","title":"Antagonism (chemistry)"},{"id":"9095212","text":"Story Paper Collectors' Digest was a journal published from November 1946 until May 2005, and with special intermittent issues continuing on until late 2007.

Wood is a common choice as a flooring material and can come in various styles, colors, cuts, and species. Bamboo flooring is often considered a form of wood flooring, although it is made from a grass (bamboo) rather than a timber. == Types  Solid ===  Hardwood flooring  Solid hardwood floors are made of planks milled from a single piece of timber. Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts of the world, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still common and popular. Solid wood floors have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood floor. It is not uncommon for homes in New England, Eastern Canada, USA, and Europe to have the original solid wood floor still in use today. Custom showroom  Solid wood manufacturing  Solid wood flooring is milled from a single piece of timber that is kiln or air dried before sawing. Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site- finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage. A number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available. Many solid woods come with grooves cut into the back of the wood that run the length of each plank, often called 'absorption strips,' that are intended to reduce cupping. Solid wood floors are mostly manufactured thick with a tongue-and-groove for installation. herringbone parquet floor with two-strip wenge border  Other wood manufacturing styles   Rotary-peel  This process involves treating the wood by boiling the log in water. After preparation, the wood is peeled by a blade starting from the outside of the log and working toward the center, thus creating a wood veneer. The veneer is then pressed flat with high pressure. This style of manufacturing tends to have problems with the wood cupping or curling back to its original shape. Rotary-peeled engineered hardwoods tend to have a plywood appearance in the grain.  Sliced-peel  This process begins with the same treatment process that the rotary peel method uses. However, instead of being sliced in a rotary fashion, with this technique the wood is sliced from the log in much the same manner that lumber is sawn from a log ‚Äì straight through. The veneers do not go through the same manufacturing process as rotary peeled veneers. Engineered hardwood produced this way tends to have fewer problems with \\"face checking\\", and also does not have the same plywood appearance in the grain.  Dry solid-sawn  Instead of boiling the hardwood logs, in this methods they are kept at a low humidity level and dried slowly to draw moisture from the inside of the wood cells. The logs are then sawn in the same manner as for solid hardwood planks. This style of engineered hardwood has the same look as solid hardwood, and does not have any of the potential problems of \\"face checking\\" that rotary-peel and slice-peel products have, because the product is not exposed to added moisture === Engineered === Wood flooring is a popular feature in many houses. Engineered wood flooring consists of two or more layers of wood adhered together to form a plank. Typically, engineered wood flooring uses a thin layer (lamella) of a more expensive wood bonded to a core constructed from cheaper wood. The increased stability of engineered wood is achieved by running each layer at a 90¬∞ angle to the layer above. This stability makes it a universal product that can be installed over all types of subfloors above, below or on grade. Engineered wood is the most common type of wood flooring in Europe and has been growing in popularity in North America. Laminate and vinyl floors are often confused with engineered wood floors, but are not. Laminate flooring uses an image of wood on its surface, while vinyl flooring is plastic formed to look like wood. The several different categories of engineered wood flooring include: * All- timber-wood floors made from multiple layers of sawn wood. Most engineered wood flooring is in this category, and does not use rotary-peeled veneer, composite wood (such as HDF), or plastic in their construction. * Veneer floors use a thin layer of wood over a core that is commonly a composite wood product. * Acrylic-impregnated wood flooring uses a layer of wood that is impregnated with liquid acrylic then hardened using a proprietary process. == Comparison of solid wood with engineered wood == It is difficult to compare solid wood flooring to engineered wood flooring due to the wide range of quality in both product categories and each type has its limitations. Solid hardwood is more prone than engineered timber to \\"gapping\\" (excessive space between planks), \\"crowning\\" (convex curving upwards when humidity increases) and \\"cupping\\" (a concave or \\"dished\\" appearance of the plank, with the height of the plank along its longer edges being higher than the centre) with increased plank size. Patented installation systems for engineered wood may allow for faster installation and easy replacement of boards. Engineered wood also allows for a floating installation where the planks are not fastened to the subfloor, but to each other. Engineered flooring is suitable for underfloor and radiant heating systems, while solid wood cannot be used with underfloor heating. Some characteristics are common to each category: solid wood is more frequently site-finished, is always in a plank format, is generally thicker than engineered wood, and is installed by nailing. Engineered wood is more frequently pre-finished, is very rarely site-finished and is installed by staple down or floating installation. == Installation systems == Wood can be manufactured with a variety of different installation systems: #Tongue-and-groove: One side and one end of the plank have a groove, the other side and end have a tongue (protruding wood along an edge's center). The tongue and groove fit snugly together, thus joining or aligning the planks, and are not visible once joined. Tongue-and-groove flooring can be installed by glue-down (both engineered and solid), floating (engineered only), or nail-down (both solid and engineered). #\\"Click\\" or Woodloc systems: there are a number of patented \\"click\\" systems that now exist. These click systems are either \\"unilin\\" or \\"fiboloc\\" A \\"click\\" floor is similar to tongue- and-groove, but instead of fitting directly into the groove, the board must be angled or \\"tapped\\" in to make the curved or barbed tongue fit into the modified groove. No adhesive is used when installing a \\"click\\" floor, making board replacement easier. This system not only exists for engineered wood floors but also engineered bamboo and a small number of solid floors (such as \\"parador solido click\\") and is designed to be used for floating installations. It is beneficial for the Do-It-Yourself market. #Floor connection system: There are a wide range of connection systems, as most of them are mill- specific manufacturing techniques. The general principle is to have grooves on all four sides of the plank with a separate, unconnected, piece that is inserted into the grooves of two planks to join them. The piece used for the connection can be made from wood, rubber, or plastic. This installation system allows for different materials (i.e. wood and metal) to be installed together if they have the same connection system. #Wood flooring can also be installed utilizing the glue-down method. This is an especially popular method for solid parquet flooring installations on concrete sub-floors. Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well. A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel similar to those used in laying ceramic tile. The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level floor. Traditionally, parquet floors will require sanding and re- finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces. However, most new Engineered Parquet blocks don't require this extra step. #Floating installation: A floating installation is where the flooring is installed on top of a layer of underlayment or moisture barrier. The individual planks are glued together using a tongue and groove adhesive such as PVA wood glue. Space for expansion should be left at the edges of the room. Cabinets and walls should not be installed on top of floating floors. Subfloors should be flat and it is not recommended to install on top of more than one layer of existing flooring. #Another installation method, secret nailing, offers similar benefits to the glue-down or fully bonded method for boards of at least 18mm. Thinner boards may require a glue-down or floating installation instead. == Finishing, buffing, sanding and drying  Floor finishes === #Polyurethane - Polyurethane floor finishes were first introduced around 1942. Water-based urethane is harder than oil-modified polyurethane and is much safer for the user. Within both categories there are many variations and other names used to describe the finish. They have very different refinishing and maintenance requirements. #Natural shellacs, lacquers, and varnishes were used in the past, as were waxes, often blended with oils. #Oil - Oiled floors have existed for several thousand years and is the most common floor finish used globally. Oils used for floor finishing are natural drying oils of vegetable origin that are not to be confused with petroleum based oils and contain no VOCs. Pre-finished oil floors can be UV cured. # Brushed and oiled - Steel brushes are used in the direction of the grain which opens up the surface of the wood and removes splinters. The wood is then oiled. === Buffing === Generally, older solid hardwood floors need to be buffed every 3‚Äì5 years. The process usually takes about one day. Buffing refers to the process of using a stand up floor buffer. The floor is abraded with 180 grit screen on the buffer. This allows for the new coat of finish to mechanically adhere to the floor. This process works with great results as long as the floor hasn't had any waxes or synthetic cleaners. Factory finished floors do not require buffing. === Refinishing === Sanding the finish off old wood floors and smoothing them out. === Floor sanding === Sanding provides a method for smoothing an installed floor, compensating for unevenness of the subfloor. Additionally, sanding is used to renew the appearance of older floors. Sanding using successively finer grades of sandpaper is required to ensure even stain penetration when stains are used, as well as to eliminate visible scratches from coarser sandpaper grades used initially. Prior to modern polyurethanes, oils and waxes were used in addition to stains to provide finishes. Beeswax and linseed oil, for example, are both natural crosslinking polymers and harden over time. ===Floor Scraping=== Prior to the 20th Century hardwood floors were refinished by scraping. This process revealed undamaged wood but left many shallow gouges in the floor. Scraping may be performed using such tools as chisels, planes, and cabinet scrapers. Modern methods duplicate this using proprietary machinery. === Wood Floor drying === Wood flooring can sustain damage when exposed to excessive humidity or water. Since most wood floors have a protective topcoat finish, the water migrates to the bottom of the floor plank, causing the plank to expand against the grain of the wood. Visually a wet floor will appear \\"cupped\\" due to this expansion. With the moisture source is removed, the wood floor will eventually release the excess moisture and return to normal, or what is known as equilibrium moisture content. In this \\"dry\\" condition the floor will again appear smooth and flat. This natural drying is a slow process and while the floor is wet (in excess of 15% moisture content), it can sustain structural damage or support microbial growth. Consequently, wood floor drying systems and methods have been developed to more quickly dry water damaged wood flooring and limit potential damage. == See also == *Parquetry *Reclaimed lumber *Reclaimed Wood Council == References == Category:Floors Category:Wood products ","title":"Wood flooring"},{"id":"9095258","text":"Joe Kane is an American author of two books and is also a journalist who writes for numerous publications such as The New Yorker, National Geographic, and Esquire.

They sang almost exclusively in English. Early demos reveal a sound not dissimilar to Joy Division, including prominent basslines, baritone vocals, dark lyrical themes and minimalist guitar. Later in their career, their music was sometimes described as goth. Their last album was more musically complex and had a hard rock edge, similar to the work of Billy Duffy. Their musical influences also included The Swans and The Sound.RED SUN RECORDS online MUSIC store ==History1980s=== Spasmodique was formed in 1982 by singer/guitarist Mark Ritsema, guitarist Arjo Hijmans, bassist Martin Doctors van Leeuwen and drummer Reinier Rietveld (formerly of Quando Quango). They released a self- titled five-song ep in 1986. The same year, they recorded songs for an opera that were later released on their album North. In 1987 Spasmodique released their full-length debut From the Cellar of Roses and toured with Umberto di Bosso e Compadres. The next year they released another album with three new studio tracks and five live tracks, Start to Believe/Someone's Out There to Get You. In 1989 they finally debuted a single, \\"The Square\\", and released another full-length album, North. By the end of the decade, the band had grown more popular internationally, with growing audiences in Germany and Austria.Dutch Rock & Pop Institute ===1990s=== 1990 would see the birth of Spasmodique's master work, the album Haven. Upon completion of the recording sessions, Hijmans left the band. The band promptly replaced him with Niek den Brave and Hans Brusse and released the non-album single \\"Spilling\\". The next year saw more personnel changes when the two new members were replaced by guitarist Raymond Gerrits. Spasmodique almost came to an end then, and embarked on a farewell tour, but the public's enthusiastic response convinced them to stay together. They released Who's Afraid, a compilation of demos and outtakes. In 1992 the band took a break from live performances that would stretch over a decade. ===2000s=== In 2000 Spasmodique began work on what would become new album Villa Delirium. It was released in 2002. That same year the book 20 Jaar Spasmodique, From the Cellar of Roses was published, detailing the band's history and discography. In 2005 singer Ritsema left the band, effectively ending Spasmodique. ===Post-Spasmodique=== Singer/songwriter/guitarist Mark Ritsema has continued to record and perform with his new band Raskolnikov. ==References== ==External links== *Spasmodique distributor Red Sun Records *Spasmodique official site *Singer Mark Ritsema's Web page, including Spasmodique lyrics and other information *Spasmodique timeline Category:Dutch musical groups Category:Dutch post-punk music groups ","title":"Spasmodique"},{"id":"9095283","text":"Andrew Walker was a corporal in the Royal Scots who killed three Army colleagues in a payroll robbery in the Pentland Hills, south of Edinburgh, in January 1985. He was ultimately sentenced in to 27 years in prison. ==Murders== On 17 January 1985, retired Major David Cunningham, 56, Staff Sergeant Terence Hosker, 39, Royal Army Pay Corps and Private John Thomson, 25, of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers picked up a ¬£19,000 payroll from a Penicuik bank to take to the Glencorse Barracks in Penicuik, Midlothian where all were stationed. According to the prosecution at his trial, Corporal Andrew Walker, age 30, armed with a sub-machine gun that he had signed out from the armoury, forced the trio to drive away from the bank. He shot Sgt. Hosker in the chest when he was tackled. Telling Private Thomson to drive along a quiet track to a reservoir, he shot Major Cunningham through the head. Thomson was then forced to unload the bodies of his colleagues before being shot himself in the head and abdomen. The money was never recovered and is thought to be buried in the hills. Walker left several clues in the deep snow and was arrested after a three-day manhunt. ==Trial== While on remand for the murders, Walker shared a cell with 18-year-old Andrew Lowden, also on remand. Lowden claimed that Walker was physically violent towards him and threatened to kill Lowden's father and girlfriend, and that Walker had confessed to the murders in lurid detail on the eve of the trial. When Lowden was released, Walker blackmailed Lowden into taking a letter out of the prison, placing the blame for the murders on the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The letter was confiscated by guards and Lowden was later called as a prosecution witness at Andrew Walker's trial. As a defense, Walker claimed he was driving elsewhere during the murders and that they were the actions of a terrorist organization. He claimed that the shells linking him to the murder weapon were planted. Walker was found guilty of murder and jailed for life. He was also convicted of theft and for attempting to pervert the course of justice by trying to smuggle the letter out of prison. The judge, Lord Grieve, recommended that Walker should serve at least 30 years for the murders. Lord Grieve noted \\"This was a calculated crime. The accused, if he was to achieve his purpose, had to kill. I am quite satisfied that the crime was carefully planned, and I am also quite sure that the substance of the evidence given by Walker was a tissue of lies.\\" He called the crimes \\"callous, brutal and calculated\\". Walker's conviction was upheld on appeal, but the sentence was shortened to 27 years as Walker successfully argued in 2002 that he should not have been treated more harshly than other murderers. ==Background and motive== Walker was in debt at the time of the murders. He owed ¬£2,000 on a car bill and was about to take delivery of a car worth ¬£8,500. His army colleagues reported that he was a liar and braggart, and generally unpopular. After an initially successful career in the army, with three tours to Northern Ireland and a mention in dispatches, he had been having disciplinary issues in the months before the robbery and murders. A commanding officer, Lt Col Fairweather, had disciplined him and said: \\"Unless you get a grip of yourself, I can see you wearing a blue suit and eating porridge\\". ==Release== In 2009, Walker suffered a stroke which left him severely disabled; in December 2011, he was released from prison on compassionate grounds. == References == Category:Royal Scots soldiers Category:Scottish people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Scotland Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Scotland Category:Scottish prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Living people Category:20th-century Scottish criminals Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Andrew Walker (murderer)"},{"id":"9095400","text":"Francisco de Hoces (died 1526) was a Spanish sailor who in 1525 joined the Loa√≠sa Expedition to the Spice Islands as commander of the vessel San Lesmes. In January 1526, the San Lesmes was blown by a gale southwards from the eastern mouth of the Strait of Magellan to 56¬∫ S latitude, where the crew thought they saw a land‚Äôs end. This is commonly understood as that they saw open waters westward away of a point of land that could be the southeasternmost tip of either Tierra del Fuego (Cape San Diego) or Isla de los Estados (Cape San Juan). In any of both cases they supposedly had seen an open water connection between Atlantic and Pacific oceans south of Tierra del Fuego, and therefore they preceded Francis Drake in inferring the existence of such a connection. This is the reason why some Spanish, Argentine, and Chilean historians maintain that the so-called Drake Passage should be named Mar de Hoces (Hoces Sea). After Loaisa expedition eventually reached the Pacific through the Strait of Magellan, the whole fleet was dispersed by another gale and San Lesmes was seen for the last time in late May 1526. The final fate of San Lesmes has been the subject of much speculation, based in some 16th- century European traces later found in different places around the South Pacific, which suggest she could have reached Easter Island, any of the Polynesian archipelagos or even New Zealand. Any of these cases would represent the first European landing in the Polynesian Triangle, preceding confirmed European landings in this region by several decades. Australian writer Robert Langdon has been the most prominent supporter of these theories in his books The Lost Caravel and The lost caravel re-explored. Following Robert Langdon's death, his theory has since been used as the basis for Greg Scowen's conspiracy thriller The Spanish Helmet, which features de Hoces as one of the main characters. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared mysteriously at sea ==Bibliography== *Land√≠n Carrasco, Amancio.

Edward Sutherland and starring Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. Filming in Technicolor, Dixie was only a moderate success and received mixed reviews. Contrary to rumor, it has not been withdrawn from circulation due to racial issues (Crosby appears in blackface during several musical numbers) but is simply one of hundreds of vintage Paramount Pictures from the 1930s and 1940s now owned by Universal and not actively marketed. The movie was broadcast several times in the late 1980s on American Movie Classics channel. The movie produced one of Crosby's most popular songs, \\"Sunday, Monday, or Always\\". ==Plot== The film opens with Dan Emmett (Crosby) and Jean (Marjorie Reynolds) seated beneath a spreading magnolia tree in the garden of her home while he sings 'Sunday, Monday or Always'. The house is seen on fire and though Dan rushes off to the fire-house for assistance it is burned down. Jean's angry father blames Dan for leaving his pipe in the hall and forbids Dan seeing his daughter again. Dan says that he wants to marry Jean after he has become successful as an actor and composer but Mason is so sure that Dan will fail he says that he will agree to the marriage if Dan returns successful within six months. Dan leaves for New Orleans and on the river boat sings 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' and encounters another entertainer, Mr. Bones (Billy de Wolfe), who cheats him at cards and wins his 500 dollars. It is not until after Bones has left the boat that Dan discovers the cards are faked but he meets him again in New Orleans and demands the return of his money. Bones denies cheating but offers to put Dan in his act. Unable to pay for a meal they have in a restaurant they are assaulted and suffer black eyes. Bones takes Dan to the boarding house owned by Mr. Cook (Raymond Walburn) and his daughter Millie (Dorothy Lamour). Neither Bones nor two other boarders can pay the rent arrears demanded by Millie and she refuses to let Dan stay until Mr. Cook intervenes to tell Bones that the manager of the local Maxwell Theatre has said Bones could try out his act that evening. The other two boarders (Eddie Foy, Jr. and Lynne Overman) sing 'Laughing Tony' to Bones but he refuses to let them join his act. Dan reminds Bones of his promise that he should be in the act but Bones insists that his act is a single until Millie threatens to lock him in his room unless all four appear and she suggests that to cover their battered features they should use black make-up. On stage the four sing 'Old Dan Tucker' and 'The Last Rose of Summer', introduce minstrel- style patter and Dan sings 'She's from Missouri'. They are successful and Millie becomes attracted to Dan who, however, tells her about Jean. The act continues to do well and is enlarged to a twenty-four artist minstrel show with Mr. Cook joining as the only white-faced member. Although Dan is also attracted to Millie he tells her he will remain loyal to Jean and Millie, in a fit of pique, agrees to marry Bones. The new minstrel show opens and the Company sings 'Minstrel Show' and 'Buffalo Gals', and Dan sings 'A Horse That Knows the Way Back Home'. At a celebration supper Dan and Millie make up their quarrel but the sound of firebells and a burning theatre, caused by Dan's pipe, puts them all out of a job. Dan returns to his home-town and finds that Jean has been stricken with paralysis and will never walk again. He insists on going through with the marriage and they travel to New York. In New Orleans Bones again asks Millie to marry him and they learn that the Theatre will be repaired in three weeks‚Äô time. When Dan sings his new song, 'If You Please', to Jean she suggests that he tries to sell his songs but a publisher refuses 'Dixie' when Dan sings it for him. He manages, however, to sell ten' other songs for 100 dollars but refuses to part with 'Dixie' when he is offered only one dollar for it. Mr. Cook arrives and tells Jean of Dan's success in New Orleans and inadvertently reveals the situation between Millie and Dan. Cook urges Dan to return to New Orleans and join a new show of forty artists and when Jean supports this plea Dan agrees. On their arrival in New Orleans Millie is still angry with Dan but realises the true situation when she sees that Jean is an invalid. The new Minstrel Show is booked into the Opera House for three months but when 'Dixie' is sung by one of the minstrels it is not well received. Jean suggests that it should be played at a quicker tempo but Dan disagrees. Jean, under the impression that Dan is in love with Millie, tells her servant, Lucius (George H. Reed), to place a letter of farewell in Dan's dressing room. The show proceeds and Dan sings 'Sunday, Monday or Always' with the company. While the minstrels sing 'She's From Missouri' Millie, backstage, tells Bones that she will marry him that night and breaks the news to Jean. On stage, Dan and the company sing ‚ÄòDixie' while his pipe, once again left lying around, starts a fire. As the tempo of the song speeds up, the entire audience joins in the rousing chorus and the fire burns Dan's dressing room and Jean's valedictory letter. ==Cast== * Bing Crosby as Daniel Decatur Emmett * Dorothy Lamour as Millie Cook * Billy De Wolfe as Mr. Bones * Marjorie Reynolds as Jean Mason * Lynne Overman as Mr. Whitlock * Eddie Foy, Jr. as Mr. Felham * Raymond Walburn as Mr. Cook * Grant Mitchell as Mr. Mason * Clara Blandick as Mrs. Mason * Tom Herbert as Homer * Olin Howland as Mr. Deveraux (as Olin Howlin) * Robert Warwick as Mr. LaPlant * Stanley Andrews as Mr. Masters * Norma Varden as Mrs. La Plant * James Burke as Riverboat captain * George H.

Variety said: \\"Dixie is a Technicolorful money-getter, ideal for the summer b.o. It has charm, lightness, good new songs by Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Heusen, the classic oldies by Dan Emmett (‚ÄòDixie‚Äô), and some spirituals such as ‚ÄòSwing Low Sweet Chariot.‚Äô And it has Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour for the marquee...The new songs are clicko. ‚ÄòSunday, Monday and Always‚Äô and ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs From Missouri‚Äô are Hit Parade material, and the Negro spiritual on the riverboat was effectively introduced by Crosby... Per usual, Crosby is in high with his vocalizing. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄòDixie‚Äô or the new Tin Pan Alley interpolations, the crooner is never from Dixie when it comes to lyric interpretations. The weaker the film vehicles, the greater is the impact of the Crosby technique. . . .Crosby now is as standard among the male singing toppers as the Four Freedoms, and today he shapes up more and more as the Will Rogers-type of solid American actor-citizen. He enjoys a stature, especially because of his radio programs, enjoyed by no other singing star in show business...\\" Bosley Crowther writing in The New York Times was not impressed, saying, inter alia: \\"Gentlemen (and ladies), be seated‚Äîat the Paramount Theatre that is to say‚Äîif you are interested in some old-time minstrel capers tossed off in a Technicolor film. For songs and jigs and funny sayings are what Paramount is delivering about 40 per cent of the time in a ruffled and reminiscent picture entitled 'Dixie' which came to that theatre yesterday. Otherwise, the remainder of the picture is mainly and not so spiritedly absorbed in a largely fictitious story of Dan Emmett, the original ‚ÄòVirginia Minstrels‚Äô man and the author of the rousing song ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù‚Äî a role which the old booper, Bing Crosby, plays... And when Bashful Bing is warbling such sparkless but adequate songs as ‚ÄúSunday, Monday or Always‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs from Missouri‚Äù or ‚ÄúA Horse That Knows the Way Back Home‚Äù, it is easy to sit back and listen. There is also a dash of liveliness in the wholly apocryphal climax which pretends to show how ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù was born. But when the story goes weakly meandering into a pointless, confused romance between Dan and a New Orleans hoyden, played airily by Dorothy Lamour, and then marries him off to an old sweetheart who is crippled (Marjorie Reynolds), it is labored and dull... Mr. De Wolfe, with some coaching, might do in an amateur show, but he is definitely a minus quantity in a spot generally filled by Bob Hope. Indeed, the fact is that none of the picture has the jubilatory spirit and dash that should go with an old-time minstrel story. There‚Äôs a great movie in that subject yet. And Paramount had a nerve to make a picture in which Bing ‚Äî and he alone ‚Äî has one hit song.\\" ==Soundtrack== *\\"Sunday, Monday, or Always\\" sung by Bing Crosby *\\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" sung by Bing Crosby *\\"Laughing Tony\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke) sung by Eddie Foy, Jr. and Lynne Overman *\\"Old Dan Tucker\\" sung by Bing Crosby, Billy De Wolfe, Eddie Foy, Jr. and Lynne Overman *\\"The Last Rose of Summer\\" sung by Bing Crosby, Billy De Wolfe, Eddie Foy, Jr. and Lynne Overman *\\"She's from Missouri\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke) sung by Bing Crosby and again by chorus *\\"Minstrel Show\\" sung by chorus *\\"Buffalo Gals\\" sung by chorus *\\"A Horse That Knows the Way Back Home\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke) sung by Bing Crosby *\\"If You Please\\" (Jimmy Van Heusen / Johnny Burke) sung by Bing Crosby *\\"Dixie\\" sung by Bing Crosby and again by chorus Two other songs - \\"Kinda Peculiar Brown\\" and \\"Miss Jemima Walks By\\" were written for the film by Burke and Van Heusen but were not used.

Leballo was co-founder of the Basutoland African Congress in 1952 and a World War II veteran and primary school headmaster. ==Early years== Leballo was born in Lifelekoaneng, Mafeteng, Lesotho (then called Basutoland) in 1915, the youngest of fourteen children, but claimed he had been born in 1925. His absentee father was a catechist in the Anglican Church who taught at St. Paul's Mission in Tsikoane and he was reared by two of his father's elder brothers.Leeman, Bernard (1999) Lesotho and the Struggle for Azania One of these, Motsoasele, was a fervent nationalist and retained his traditional religion until his death in 1947. The other uncle, Nathaniel, was an Anglican pastor and Potlako received a Christian education, first at St. Saviour's in Hlotse and later at Masite Institution in Morija. While at St. Saviour's, he was abducted by Uncle Motsoasele who took him to receive his traditional Sesotho initiation known as lebollo. Lebollo was contrary to St. Saviour's rules and, as a result, he was expelled. ==Move to South Africa== In 1940, Leballo became a student at Lovedale College, near Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa. He was active in the African National Congress Youth League until he and other radical leaders including Robert Sobukwe were expelled from the ANC and went on to form the PAC, a more radical Africanist movement. He held the distinction of having successfully nominated Chief Albert Lutuli (1952) and Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe (1959) to the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) respectively. He stated later (1984) than he believed that leaving the ANC (although encouraged by Kwame Nkrumah and the Basuto leader Ntsu Mokhehle) was a mistake and that his \\"Africanists\\" should have fought for control of the party rather than forming a new one. He was elected Secretary General of the PAC and within a year the new party was seriously challenging the ANC. ==Pan Africanist Congress of Azania== After the anti-pass campaign and the Sharpeville massacre when PAC supporters were shot by police in 1960, Leballo was sentenced to prison for incitement, and on his release in 1962 was exiled to Basutoland (now Lesotho), where he helped re-establish the PAC. His leadership included the formation of Poqo, the military wing of the PAC, later to become the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA). The 1962 ‚Äì 1964 Poqo uprising failed partly because the shipment to the Transkei coast of arms from Ghana and Egypt vanished, reportedly sold by corrupt PAC officials, but mostly because of Leballo's expulsion from Basutoland (his own country) following South African pressure. Leballo set up PAC headquarters in Ghana and Tanzania. He was responsible for a major ideological shift towards Maoism but until 1976 was unable to get majority backing from external refugees, many of whom lost their zeal for militant activities while still demanding a major role in party affairs. A successful demagogue in the rural areas and townships, Leballo was not suited in exile to the diplomatic circuit. The majority of the so-called \\"reformist- diplomat\\" section of the external PAC repeatedly challenged the PAC leadership but were then themselves challenged by the arrival in exile in 1974 of 178 troops of the refugee Basutoland Congress Party who trained as PAC Azanian People's Liberation Army guerrillas in Libya and then by 500 Soweto and Cape students who joined the Basotho in Libya. ==Chairman of the PAC== In 1978 the PAC leader Sobukwe died in restriction in Kimberley and Leballo was elected Chairman of the PAC. His position was tenuous. Nkrumah was long gone and Mao Zedong died in 1976. The PAC had been forced to consider extremely unsavory allies such as Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin. The main threat however came from the US Carter administration that had resolved it needed South Africa as a stable element in the equation to settle the Zimbabwe issue. The ANC and PAC were urged to abandon guerrilla war and embrace d√©tente and dialogue. Andrew Young, the (USA UN ambassador) and the Nigerians reportedly donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to David Sibeko, the PAC representative at the UN, to dilute Leballo's revolutionary ideology by getting his own supporters elected to the new PAC executive. Sibeko was largely successful (hence Leballo's title of \\"Chairman\\" rather than \\"President\\") but neglected the newly recruited Azanian People's Army (APLA), already victorious over the older APLA of Templeton Ntantala and demanding a greater share in finances. In 1979 Leballo left for medical treatment in England and a triumvirate of Sibeko, Vusi Make, and Elias Ntloedibe announced they were the new PAC leadership following Leballo's \\"resignation.\\" APLA commanders arrived in Dar es Salaam from Itumbi Camp, Chunya near Mbeya, and quarreled with Sibeko. The same evening they shot him dead. Vusi Make was then declared the new PAC leader but APLA rejected him. In the ensuing standoff at Chunya, Tanzanian troops coldbloodedly killed four unarmed APLA soldiers, wounded forty and split the survivors. Forty(40)of the APLA soldiers who were deemed dangerous by the PAC leadership were sent to a detention camp in Mgagau, Iringa. In 1980 Leballo arrived in Zimbabwe and established a new PAC headquarters. He had no funds and was financially supported by a white APLA intelligence officer. Although he was welcomed by Edgar Tekere, the ZANU (PF) Secretary General and other party and military leaders, others including Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, pointedly kept their distance. Leballo's intelligence officer advised him to bolster links with North Korea, whose ambassador was enthusiastic and had even financed household purchases for Leballo, because the officer felt that however Pan Africanist the party was, it simply couldn't trust African governments and it was advisable to find a secure base in North Korea. Leballo declined, saying the party had to rely on Africa, however treacherous politicians were. He was encouraged by the Libyan government's promise to finance an exiled University of Azania in Zimbabwe. ==Deportation== In February 1981 John Nyati Pokela, a senior PAC member, was released from detention in South Africa and replaced Make as the leader of the \\"reformist- diplomat\\" PAC. Leballo wrote him suggesting a meeting, stating in private that he would accept Pokela as PAC President/Chairman if he (Leballo) could command APLA. Pokela never replied. They both attended the first anniversary celebrations of independence at Rufaro Stadium but merely waved to each other at a distance. Tanzanian sympathizers at the Tanzanian High Commission warned Leballo that the Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, and the Tanzanian secretary general of the OAU Liberation Committee, Hashim Mbita, had both demanded Leballo's expulsion from Zimbabwe. The next day Leballo was arrested while waiting to meet Edson Zvobgo, a government minister, imprisoned, and deported the next day. Handed a few dollars by his intelligence officer as he was rushed onto a plane, Leballo eventually arrived in Libya after being shunted around the Middle East and losing all his luggage. ==Later years== From 1981 until his death in 1986 Leballo worked in Ghana with President Jerry Rawlings' People's Committees but was mostly penniless in London. His Ugandan and Tanzanian diplomatic passports were revoked but he used his Liberian passport to build up links with the Rwandan Tutsi and Museveni's Ugandan resistance movements. After Pokela's sudden death in 1985 Leballo began to have success reuniting the PAC but died suddenly in January 1986 in Greenwich, London. He was buried in Lifelekoaneng, Lesotho. The Basutoland Congress Party, which he had co-founded and whose military wing he had trained, acknowledged that Leballo had played a major part in bringing down the regime of Leabua Jonathan Molapo in 1986. ==Summary== Although largely forgotten in South African politics, Leballo was responsible for temporarily turning the PAC away in the years 1966 - 1979 from semi-fascism towards Maoism. He recognized the futility of the Poqo slogan \\"drive the whites into the sea\\" (later revived by the remnant PAC as \\"one settler one bullet\\" with disastrous electoral consequences - 1.2% of the vote in 1994 and 0.7% thereafter). Sibeko's grab for power in 1979, the Chunya massacre, and Leballo's peripheralization were not just the termination of one man's career but the death of a credible left wing alternative to the ANC/SACP alliance. ==References== * Leeman, Bernard (1992) Lesole la Mokhehle ‚Äì Soldier for Mokhehle, PAC Office Canberra. * Leeman, Bernard (1999) Lesotho and the Struggle for Azania, Roma, Lesotho ‚Äì updated 1985 Bremen University PhD Thesis. * Leeman, Bernard (1995) The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, Australian National University, Canberra. * Mphanya, Ntsukunyane (2004) A Brief History of the Basutoland Congress Party 1952 - 2002, Morija, Lesotho, pp 95 ‚Äì 98. *Godfrey Mwakikagile, Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2010), pp. 368, 372. *Kevin Shillington, ed., Encyclopedia of African History (New York: Taylor & Francis Group, 2005), p. 1394\\\\.

According to Von Mohl the term was K≈´≈°a, apparently borrowed from Aramaic, probably during the Arsacid dynasty (248 BCE-224 CE).Von Mohl J., (ed. trans.), Firdausi, Le Livre des rois, Paris (1831-68), pp137, 178. ==Historical background== It seems the instrument was invented during the Achaemenid dynasty (550-330 BCE) of Persia, for military purposes. The instrument was a pair of drums, made of clay, wood or metal in the form of a hemispherical kettle, with skin stretched over the mouth. Kus was played with drumsticks of leather or wood (The leather drumstick was called Daval). Kus usually was carried on horseback, camelback or elephant during war to encourage the army. The instrument was also played on many occasions such as festivals and weddings. In ancient times, kus was accompaniment by karnay (Persian trumpet or horn). Particularly the Persian epic poets Ferdowsi and Nizami in describing battles mentioned kus and karnay in a number of entries.Pope U., An Outline History of Persian Music and Musical Theory, in Survey of Persian Art, Vol. VI, pp. 2783-2804. Many Persian miniatures paintings show the presence and importance of the Kus and Karnay in the war fields. According to the Greek historians, the drum was used by the Persians; Plutarch tells of Iranian warriors at the time of the Arsacid dynasty using kus as warlike instruments.Plutarch, Crassus, chapter XXiii, 10 Apparently after the introduction of Islam, the word NaghghƒÅreh was used for small kettledrums. It seems that the word Naghghareh comes from the Arabic verb Naghr- that means to strike and to beat. A few poets mentioned the name Naghghareh, such as the great Persian mystic poet Molana Jalal al-Din Rumi. *Kus-e-Ashkebus: Kus attributed to Ashkebus, famous commander of King Afrasiyab mentioned in masterpiece Shahnameh of the famous poet of Persia, Ferdosi. *Kus-e-dolat: Kettledrum to be played during the victories. *Kus-e- id: Kettledrum to be played during id (festival). *Kus-e-Iskandar: Kus attributed to Iskandar. *Kus-e-jang: Kettledrum used in wars in order to embolden and encourage the soldiers. *Kus-e-khaghani: Kettledrum for Khaghan (title of Mongol emperors). *Kus-e-Mahmudi: Kettledrum attributed to King Mahmud Ghaznavi. *Kus-e-rehlat: Kettledrum to be played during the decamping. *Kus-e-ruyin: Kettledrum with brazen body. *Kust: Another name of Kus mentioned in Shahnameh of Ferdosi. ==See also== *Naqara *Nagara (Drum) *Naker ==References== ==External links== * History of the Kus, from ancient times until the 18th century; in German: Janissary instruments and Europe Category:Hand drums Category:Persian musical instruments Category:Percussion instruments Category:Iranian inventions ","title":"Kus"},{"id":"9095510","text":"Events from the year 1915 in the United Kingdom.

Given balls of these three colors arranged randomly in a line (it does not matter how many balls there are), the task is to arrange them such that all balls of the same color are together and their collective color groups are in the correct order. The solution to this problem is of interest for designing sorting algorithms; in particular, variants of the quicksort algorithm that must be robust to repeated elements may use a three-way partitioning function that groups items less than a given key (red), equal to the key (white) and greater than the key (blue). Several solutions exist that have varying performance characteristics, tailored to sorting arrays with either small or large numbers of repeated elements.The latter case occurs in string sorting with multi-key quicksort. == The array case == This problem can also be viewed in terms of rearranging elements of an array. Suppose each of the possible elements could be classified into exactly one of three categories (bottom, middle, and top). For example, if all the elements are in 0 ... 1, the bottom could be defined as elements in 0 ... 0.33 (not including 0.33), the middle as 0.33 ... 0.66 (not including 0.66) and the top as 0.66 and greater. (The choice of these values illustrates that the categories need not be equal ranges). The problem is then to produce an array such that all \\"bottom\\" elements come before (have an index less than the index of) all \\"middle\\" elements, which come before all \\"top\\" elements. One algorithm is to have the top group grow down from the top of the array, the bottom group grow up from the bottom, and keep the middle group just above the bottom. The algorithm indexes three locations, the bottom of the top group, the top of the bottom group, and the top of the middle group. Elements that are yet to be sorted fall between the middle and the top group. At each step, examine the element just above the middle. If it belongs to the top group, swap it with the element just below the top. If it belongs in the bottom, swap it with the element just above the bottom. If it is in the middle, leave it. Update the appropriate index. Complexity is Œò(n) moves and examinations. ===Pseudocode=== The following pseudocode for three-way partitioning which assumes zero-based array indexing was proposed by Dijkstra himself. It uses three indices , and , maintaining the invariant that . * Entries from 0 up to (but not including) are values less than , * entries from up to (but not including) are values equal to , * entries from up to (but not including) are values not yet sorted, and * entries from to the end of the array are values greater than . procedure three-way-partition(A : array of values, mid : value): i ‚Üê 0 j ‚Üê 0 k ‚Üê size of A while j < k: if A[j] < mid: swap A[i] and A[j] i ‚Üê i + 1 j ‚Üê j + 1 else if A[j] > mid: k ‚Üê k - 1 swap A[j] and A[k] else: j ‚Üê j + 1 == See also == *American flag sort ==References== == External links == * Explanation and interactive explanatory execution of the algorithm, sorting two or three colors Category:Sorting algorithms Category:Computational problems Category:Edsger W.

Anderson played college football as a linebacker at the University of Michigan from 1988 to 1991. As a senior in 1991, he won the Butkus Award as the best collegiate linebacker in the country, was named Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the Big Ten Conference and was selected as a first-team All- American. He is the only player in Michigan Wolverines football history to lead the team in tackles for four consecutive years, and his 390 tackles at Michigan ranks third in school history. Anderson also played professional football as linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993 and the Washington Redskins in 1994. ==Early years== Anderson was born in Long Beach, California, in 1968. He attended Glenbrook South High School in Glenview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. ==University of Michigan== Anderson enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1987 and played college football as a linebacker for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1988 to 1991. ===1988 season=== After redshirting in 1987, Anderson started six games at inside linebacker for the 1988 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 9-2-1 record, outscored opponent 361-167, and was ranked #4 in the final AP Poll. After Michigan lost its first two games to then #1 ranked Miami and eventual national champion Notre Dame, Anderson was inserted into the lineup for the third game against Wake Forest. The Wolverines went undefeated in their final 10 games. Anderson had the best game of his freshman season against Ohio State, registering 16 tackles, as the Wolverines defeated the Buckeyes 34-31. He also had 12 tackles, including eight solo tackles, in Michigan's 22-14 victory over USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl. Despite his freshman status and starting only half the games, Anderson led the 1988 team with 77 tackles. ===1989 season=== As a sophomore, Anderson started all 12 games at inside linebacker for the 1988 Michigan team that compiled a 10-2 record, outscored opponents 335-184, and was ranked #7 in the final AP Poll. He had his best game of the season against Ohio State, registering 15 tackles, including 12 solo tackles, as the Wolverines defeated the Buckeyes, 7-0. He also had 10 tackles against USC in the 1990 Rose Bowl. For the second consecutive year, Anderson led the Wolverines in tackles; his 105 tackles was 25 tackles higher than the team's second-leading tackler. ===1990 season=== As a junior in 1990, Anderson again started all 12 games at inside linebacker for the 1990 Michigan team that compiled a 9-3 record and defeated Ole Miss in the 1991 Gator Bowl. He led the Wolverines in tackles (106) for the third straight year, won the team's Frederick Matthei Award as player who displays leadership, drive and achievement on the athletic field and in the classroom, and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten linebacker. ===1991 season=== As a senior, he was a team co-captain and started all 12 games at inside linebacker for the 1991 Michigan team that compiled a 10-2 record, outscored opponents 420-203, and was ranked #6 in the final AP Poll. In his final regular season game, Anderson had 17 tackles, including 16 solo tackles, one quarterback sack, and forced a fumble and recovered another, in a 31-3 victory over Ohio State, as the Wolverines limited the Buckeyes to 109 rushing yards. With a team-leading 102 tackles, Anderson became the only person in Michigan football history to lead the team in tackles for four consecutive years. At the end of the 1991 season, Cambpell was selected by the United Press International as a first-team All-American. He was also named the Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the Big Ten Conference, and he won both the Butkus Award and the Jack Lambert Trophy as the best collegiate linebacker in the country. He was named the 1991 winner of The Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's best linebacker. In January 1992, he participated in the 17th annual Japan Bowl. With eight minutes remaining in the game, he intercepted a Matt Rodgers pass that set up the game-winning touchdown in a 14-13 win for the East squad. After the game, East coach Johnny Majors called the interception \\"the work of an outstanding athlete\\" and called Anderson \\"an alert, smart player.\\" ===Career statistics=== In each of Anderson's four years at Michigan, the Wolverines defeated Ohio State, either won outright or tied for the Big Ten Conference championship and finished no lower than #7 in the final AP polls. During that time, Anderson compiled 390 tackles, including 286 solo tackles, a career tally that ranks third at Michigan behind Jarrett Irons (429) and Ron Simpkins (415). He also had 25 tackles for loss, seven quarterback sacks, six pass breakups, four fumble recoveries, and four interceptions. ==Professional career== Anderson was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the seventh round (186th overall pick) of the 1992 NFL Draft. He appeared in eight games, one as a starter, for the Chiefs during the 1993 NFL season. He was waived by the Chiefs in late August 1994. At the end of November 1994, Anderson signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins. He appeared in two games, neither as a starter, for the Redskins during the final month of the 1994 NFL season. ==Family and later years== Anderson is the older brother of Kurt Anderson, an assistant coach with the Buffalo Bills of the NFL. After retiring as a football player, Anderson operated FIT (Fitness In Teams, LLC), an organization providing social skills training for children with autism spectrum disorders and ADD.

The origin of the place-name is from the Old English words fleax and leah meaning place where flax is grown; the place-name appears as Flaxlea in 1163. ==History== Flaxley was once a major industrial centre. The Forest of Dean was an important medieval ironworking region, and the earliest forge in Flaxley is recorded in the 12th century. Westbury Brook was the site of five water mills, and at Gun's Mill by Flaxley was one of the main gun foundries of the English Civil War era. A blast furnace was built there in 1629. Today, Flaxley offers a pleasant picturesque wooded scene and is difficult to imagine it any other way, but it has a strong industrial past, notably of iron furnaces, forges and water mills. The earliest known forge was present as early as 1150 and at least five mills have been identified as utilising the waters of Westbury Brook which runs down the valley. The earliest and most famous industrial site is Gun's Mill, (at SO67519), now a guesthouse. This blast furnace, was built by Sir John Wintour, operated between 1629 to 1743 and was named after William Gunne, the owner of an earlier mill on the site. Gun's Mill was used primarily for armament production and in 1629, the Crown ordered that 610 guns were to be made there and sent to the Netherlands, but many were subsequently used by both sides in the English Civil War. The furnace was destroyed by order of Parliament in 1650 but it was rebuilt in 1683 and remained in use until c.1743 when it became a paper mill. The latter closed in 1879 but several of the furnace's buildings remain and the site is now a scheduled monument as it is the finest remaining example of a charcoal blast furnace from this period in the country. Flaxley is also famous for its old Cistercian abbey founded between 1148-1154 by Roger, Earl of Hereford, at the spot where his father, Miles of Gloucester, was killed whilst out hunting. The abbey and its monks were initially favoured by the Crown and it was granted land (by Henry II in 1158) as well as timber and woodlands (by Henry III in 1227) The abbey survived as a monastic entity until the Dissolution in 1536-37 when its lands and manor were granted to Sir William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower of London (who supervised the execution of Anne Boleyn). The present Church of St Mary, with its contrasting red and grey Forest stone, was built in 1856. It has a richly decorated interior and a very elaborate font made of Painswick (Cotswold) stone with marble columns on octagonal steps. Lying just west of Flaxley in Welshbury Woods, is Welshbury Hill. This Iron Age hill fort has impressive triple defensive rampart and ditches on its south and west sides with a single bank and ditch on the north and east and an entrance. It lies on Forestry Commission land, and is accessible to the public. It has never been excavated but in recent years it has been damaged by forestry operations and to minimise this the Forestry Commission has reverted to using horses on the site. Two interesting archaeological finds are associated with Welshbury, firstly a Celtic electrum coin which was found in fields nearby and depicts a stag or horse and secondly, an iron spearhead of Roman military style, which was found inside the ramparts after ground disturbance due to logging. Below the north ramparts of Welshbury is the enigmatic St Anthony's Well, an ancient spring whose name dates from the medieval period. However prehistoric flint implements have been found in the springs vicinity as well as Iron Age and Roman artefacts and it seems likely that the well was a ritual site for a long period of time. Saint Anthony's Well water is always extremely cold and for generations local people have bathed in it for the treatment of rheumatism and arthritis. ==Flaxley Abbey== Flaxley Abbey. The most significant feature of the village is Flaxley Abbey which dates back the 12th century and is now a private residence, although the summer village fetes are still held here. An 18th century resident of the abbey was Mary Pope, who gave her name to Pope's Hill, an inhabited hill to the south west of the village. Other buildings of note are the Church of St Mary the Virgin, and tiny Flaxley School which closed as a school in 1901 and more recently has been refurbished and is now used as a community village hall. Flaxley is in the parish of Westbury-on-Severn. ==References== Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Forest of Dean ","title":"Flaxley"},{"id":"9095900","text":"William Armisted Burwell (March 15, 1780 - February 16, 1821) was a nineteenth-century Virginia politician and planter who served as presidential secretary and as a Democratic-Republican in the United States House of Representatives and the Virginia House of Delegates. ==Early and family life== William Burwell's grave Born near Boydton, Mecklenburg County to Thacker Burwell and his wife, the former Mary Armistead, Burwell was descended from the First Families of Virginia. He had an elder brother Edwin, who would move abroad.Burwell family history at https://archive.org/stream/recordofburwellf01burw/recordofburwellf01burw_djvu.txt Burwell graduated from the College of William and Mary. He married Letitia McCreery (variously spelled McCreary, McCroory or McCrury) of Baltimore, who bore a son, William McCreery Burwell (1809-1888) before Burwell died at age 40. ==Career== After moving to Franklin County, Virginia in 1802, Burwell became involved in politics and thrice won election to represent Franklin County in the Virginia House of Delegates, serving in that part time position from 1804 to 1806 alongside Henry T. Callaway before being succeeded by John Callaway after his election to the U.S. Congress.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly, 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 235, 240, 243 During that period, Meriwether Lewis retired as President Thomas Jefferson's private secretary to make his famous westward expedition, and Burwell would succeed him and move to Washington, D.C. Burwell then sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy. Burwell won re-election several times, serving from 1806 until his death. In the 1810 census, Burwell owned 63 slaves in Franklin County1810 U.S. Federal Census for Franklin County, Virginia, p 8 of 52 and a decade later the household included 71 enslaved and 5 free colored persons1820 U.S. Federal Census for Franklin County, Virginia p. 4 of 38 about double the number owned by his cousin William Burwell of Frederick County to the north (son of Nathaniel Burwell).1820 U.S. Federal Census for Middletown, Frederick County, Virginia p. 10 of 11 Oddly, after his death in 1821, this William A.

His Franklin County home, the Burwell-Holland House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic- registers/033-0003/ His son William M. Burwell was born in Botetourt County, and spent some time as an editor in New Orleans, Louisiana before returning to Virginia, where he followed his father's planter and politician traditions and married an heiress from Bedford County. Ten times (with gaps), Bedford County voters elected William M. Burwell as one of their two representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates. Although he owned far fewer slaves than his father (only owning 11 slaves in 18601860 U.S. Federal Census Slave Schedule for Liberty, Bedford County, Virginia p. 1 of 4), he continued to serve as a legislator through the American Civil War. The younger Burwell secured subsidies for the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which passed through his Avenel farm in the county seat (then called Liberty, but which would expand after the American Civil War onto that property). William M. Burwell had four daughters and vigorously supported the Confederacy. His eldest, Letitia M. Burwell(1831-1905), wrote two books supporting the Lost Cause, the most famous being a A Girl's Life in Virginia Before the War.https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/burwell/burwell.htmlhttps://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2008/07/letitia- burwell.html === Other relatives === Another WIlliam A.

It is most commonly used to help remove air from a pneumothorax. The valve is usually designed as a rubber sleeve within a plastic case where the rubber sleeve is arranged so that when air passes through the valve one way the sleeve opens and lets the air through. However, when air is sucked back the other way, the sleeve closes off and no air is allowed backwards. This construction enables it to act as a one-way valve allowing air (or fluid) to flow only one way along the drainage tube. The end of the drainage tube is placed inside the patient's chest cavity, within the air or fluid to be drained. The flutter valve is placed in the appropriate orientation (most packages are designed so the valve can only be connected in the appropriate orientation) and the pneumothorax is thus evacuated from the patient's chest. There are several potential problems with these valves. One is that the chest tube can clog. When chest tube clogging occurs, the pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema can recur. This can also lead to empyema. The other is that these tend to leak fluid. To address this, some have turned to small chest drainage alternatives, such as the Atrium Express Mini 500 or the Teleflex Mini Sahara. An alternative solution is to attach a sputum trap to the valve, thus providing a reservoir to capture the draining fluid. The Atrium Pneumostat chest drain valve combines a one way valve and a 30cc collection chamber to address this issue. The flutter valves or Pneumostat valves allow patients to ambulate more easily and patients may be able leave the hospital in certain instances. The traditional chest tube collection box often would require longer hospital stay.

They have made, from a very local identity, a universal rap that has become popular around the whole country and has achieved rankings not normally held by hip-hop. They won Best Disc of the Year in Rolling Stone Magazine for their first work ‚Äú‚ÄùCata Cheli‚Äù‚Äù and Best New Group from PEMOC (Group of Musical Journalists)please cite the source information. They have known each other since childhood, and began testing the waters with the rest of their friends in ‚Äú‚ÄùAmenaza Criminal‚Äù‚Äù, in a totally amateur way. With time, only the actual members of the group continued in the world of hip-hop, completing the formation of La Excepci√≥n. They discovered they could make rap using their own gypsy slang and they continued to polish their style in small concerts. In one of these they met the ubiquitous MC and producer Frank T, who decided to speed their journey, making first their single ‚ÄúEn tu carro paio!‚Äù (2002) and then their first record, ‚Äú‚ÄùCata Cheli‚Äù‚Äù, as well as interpreting with them the song \\"El negro, el cojo y el gitano\\". In addition to the basis provided by Frank T, they relied upon the Frenchman, Super Jeff Dominguez to mix their first CD. Their success among critics and sales has led them to act in the main festivals of the country, like Vi√±a Rock, the Monegros Desert Festival or the Urban Culture de Madrid.

Present tense: poets in the world  Kliatt  Find Articles at BNET.com ==Early years== Mark Pawlak was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1948, into an ethnic Polish working-class family. Buffalo's Polish east-side neighborhoods and the Langfield Housing development, where he lived during most of his grade school years, figure prominently in the poems of his first poetry collection, The Buffalo Sequence. He graduated from Immaculate Heart of Mary School and then attended Kensington High School. He completed is secondary education at Maryvale Senior High School, in Cheektowaga, New York, a working-class commuter suburb, where his family had moved in the early 1960s. He attend college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he graduated in 1970 with a degree in physics. While at MIT, he studied poetry with Denise Levertov. Poetry has been an integral part of his life and work ever since. ==Career== His opposition to the Vietnam War and to Defense Department funding of scientific research lead him to give up a promising career in experimental physics. He became involved in social justice causes and in progressive education. He taught mathematics, sciences, and creative writing, briefly on the west coast at the Santa Barbara Free School. He returned to Cambridge to help start The Group School, an independent alternative high school for poor and working class youth, many of whom were public school truants or drop-outs. In 1978, he took a position teaching mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he continues to teach and to work as an administrator. Pawlak is the author of nine poetry collections, most recently Reconnaissance: New and Selected Poems and Poetic Journals\\" (2016). His original poems have been translated into German, Polish and Spanish. In English, his work has appeared widely in such anthologies as The Best American Poetry in 2006 (Billy Collins, ed.), Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust (Charles Fishman, ed.), and For the Time Being: The Bootstrap Book of Poetic Journals, as well as in numerous magazines and journals, including New American Writing, Mother Jones, Poetry South, The Saint Ann‚Äôs Review, Solstice and The World. He has been the recipient of two Massachusetts Artist Fellowship awards.'' The Buffalo Sequence, his first full collection of poems was strongly influenced by the poetry of William Carlos Williams and Cesar Vallejo, and by the autobiographical writings of Maxim Gorky. These lyrical poems looked back upon his formative years growing up in Buffalo but are refracted through the lens of his work with inner city teenagers in Cambridge, many of whom lived, as he had, in housing projects. The original edition of The Buffalo Sequence concluded with an essay titled ‚ÄúPoetry from an American Oral Tradition.‚Äù In it, he had spelled out his poetics at the time and his aspirations in writing the poems. It was an appeal to poets who, like himself, had grown up in ethnic working class communities. He urged them to resist conforming to the homogenized middle class version of the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream,‚Äù and, in place of that, to give prominence to their ethnic cultural heritage‚Äî‚ÄúThis Land is Your Land‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful.‚Äù All the News, his next collection, was a sharp departure from The Buffalo Sequence. The poems, often drawing from contemporary newspaper accounts and current events, are didactic in nature, overtly political, and working class in perspective. They are influenced by the poetry of Bertolt Brecht, in particular Brecht's \\"Deutsche Kriegsfibel\\" poems, which Pawlak had translated into English. Special Handling: Newspaper Poems New and Selected, his subsequent collection fused the Brechtian impulse toward political statement with a \\"found poetry\\" aesthetic. The influences of the documentary poetics of Charles Reznikoff and Ernesto Cardenal are also evident in two lengthy poem sequences in this collection, \\"German Lessons\\", which investigates the Holocaust, and \\"Chalatenango\\", about the Salvadoran \\"death squads\\" and the massacres by the military of Salvadoran peasants. In Official Versions, Pawlak continued to explore political themes, and \\"found poetry' aesthetics, often with wit and wry humor. In \\"Hart's Neck Haibun\\", a series of long poetic journals that make up the backbone of this collection, he returns to the lyrical mode he first displayed in The Buffalo Sequence. \\"Go to the Pine\\" shows Pawlak continuing his formal exploration of the poetic journal, drawing on the people and landscape of coastal downeast Maine, specifically the Passamaquoddy Bay region.Written in a hybrid form combining prose and poetry. It is a continuation of his ongoing project of \\"daily takes\\" that fuses the tradition of Japanese poetic journals written in the haibun form with the observational poetics of American Objectivist poets such as Charles Reznikoff and Lorine Niedecker, with nods to William Carlos Williams' early experimental books \\"Spring and All\\" and \\"The Descent of Winter.\\" \\"Natural Histories\\" is a subsequent chapbook collection of haiku-like poems. \\"Reconnaissance: New and Selected Poems and Poetic Journals, 2005-2015\\" is his most recent poetry collection. Pablo Medina wrote in praise of this collection that it achieves \\"a consistency of vision and linguistic vigor I can only marvel at and applaud. Pawlak is among the very best poets working today.\\" In addition to being a poet and educator, he has pursued another career as a literary editor/publisher. After West End Press published a chapbook of his poems in 1974, Pawlak was invited to join the West End as an associate editor. He held that post for several years. He then joined the editorial board of Hanging Loose Press in 1980. He continues to serve as a co-editor of Hanging Loose magazine and Hanging Loose Press books.http://w3.fiu.edu/gulfstrm/Pawlak.htm Hanging Loose was started in 1966 by several former students of Denise Levertov. She served as contributing editor for over 25 years and in that capacity introduced Pawlak to the magazine while he was studying with her at MIT. In addition to co-editing poetry titles and Hanging Loose magazine, he has compiled six anthologies, most recently, \\"When We Were Countries: Outstanding Poems and Stories by High School Writers\\" and Present/Tense: Poets in the World, an anthology of contemporary American political poetry.Pawlak, Mark, Lourie, Dick, Hershon, Robert, Schreiber, Ron, eds.

Similar to flash mobs, tunnel runs tend to be organized in a clandestine manner,As described in both reviews organisation of runs tends to be via a \\"members only\\" website with directions and routes often only handed out at the rendez-vous; the description \\"clandestine\\" was also used in the Islington Council description. although some groups do inform police about 'runs' beforehand. The activity originated in 2004 in the United Kingdom (UK). The original group, known as London Tunnel Runners, has facilitated regular tunnel runs since their founding in 2004. At times, convoys of over 200 cars have driven through tunnels in this manner.Autocar, February 2006, p.68‚Äì69. and ==Background and history== Tunnel running, or \\"tunneling\\", originated as a social activity amongst TVR enthusiasts in 2004. Some sources state it was originated by Eddie Wharram, others that it started with a group of six enthusiasts. Autocar states that six people \\"turned up\\" following a suggestion. Eddie Wharram stated in an interview that the initial motive was simply the \\"unbelievable\\" noise caused by echoes of a large-displacement engine within the confines of a tunnel. Tunnel running has since evolved into a much larger membership where runs are organised in a democratic manner with no overall leaders. Unwritten rules have been created whereby participation and mutual appreciation of others' cars are the aim instead of any perceived competition. Semi-regular meetings have since followed, often at night or pre-dawn to avoid congestion and gatecrashing by people who may not care for the safety of others. Runs could comprise more than 200 cars. Late-night start times allowed participants unfamiliar with London geography to follow in convoy. Since forming, The London Tunnel Runners have visited areas such as Wales, the south coast of England and as far as Paris. Route and logistical information is often provided by the organisers, themselves enthusiasts. Due to the size and nature of the group, traffic jams have been known to occur due to passers-by trying to take photographs. Police attended to a minor traffic jam on the Paris run near the Eiffel tower as pictures were taken by locals, whose actions were for the most part limited to curiosity and chatting with participants. Since November 2007, Missbanzai, a Japanese sports car club, has organised tunnel runs through central London for Japanese car enthusiasts.Missbanzai These events have had up to 450 modified Japanese cars in attendance, from Nissan Skylines to Honda Preludes, and have raised over ¬£15,000 for charities. ==OrganizationVehicles=== While it is not a requirement to have a particular type of car in order to attend, due to the nature of the groups, an attendee's car tends to be one of the following: * a recognized high- performance vehicle * a recognized classic vehicle * a vehicle considered to be unique enough to attract interest * a performance version of a standard car (e.g. Golf R32, BMW M3) ===Membership=== The criteria for membership to the London Tunnel Runners is stated by the organizers to be one of maturity, respect for others and their property. The runs are organized within a restricted Internet forum to prevent them from being gatecrashed by unwanted parties, who may not have the same core beliefs, and bring the London Tunnel Run into disrepute. ===International aspects=== There are a number of international members who drive to the UK so they can join the runs. From 2007 onwards, a group of Dutch members have participated in tunnel runs on more than one occasion. They will usually arrive early on a Saturday morning to be met by a number of the UK Tunnel Runners where they may go to an event before the tunnel run. === Safety issues === The original group maintains active relations with the Metropolitan Police Service to make sure that inconvenience to the general public is kept to a minimum. Many other groups have been founded since tunnel running has become more popular, as a result of this, some groups who do not maintain the same respect for the law have caused negative feelings towards tunnel runners. To combat this, the London Tunnel Runners liaise with the police before every run, to enable the police to deal with genuine complaints that may be made towards the group, such as the complaint from Islington London Borough Council. ==Complaints and criticisms== \\"Modified cars racing through east London's tunnels are endangering motorists and making life a misery for residents,\\" stated Poplar and Limehouse Member of Parliament Jim Fitzpatrick. \\"Up to 400 cars are congregating in Dartford and Essex and racing along a route which covers the Blackwall Tunnel and the Limehouse Link.\\" The Labour MP, who has written to Tower Hamlets Police and the council demanding action on the organised events, also said the cars are using the tunnels at Westferry Circus to regroup and film stunts. He pointed out a YouTube video from 20 October 2012 which saw an estimated 265 Japanese fast cars gather in the roads under the Canary Wharf estate. The MP, who has received numerous complaints from constituents, sent a Twitter message following the 20 October meet which read: \\"@MissBanzai Well, another #TunnelRun draws to a close. 3hrs from Start to Finish for most, 10 Tunnels, 265 Jap Motors woke up #London, one more time.\\" In late 2006, complaints by Islington London Borough Council led to contact from the police. This was caused by tunnel runners who had developed a predilection for the underpasses under the Barbican Estate, which are wide and spacious, allowing multiple cars in the tunnels at once. The complaint centered on the problem that they are above ground and act as underpasses for a 2000-apartment central-London housing estate, meaning the noise would reverberate through the apartment block. This combined with the time of the runs caused some tenants to complain.Islington Gazette, 24 January 2007. Bid to halt tunnel racers The council named the problem group as the \\"London Tunnelers\\", in doing so, they described them as a \\"clandestine group of sports car enthusiasts\\" and stated that they were \\"quite notorious in certain circles\\" due to their choice of location and activity. The police stated that \\"It seems the idea [of the runs] is to make as much noise as possible, using high-powered sports cars. But there have been no allegations of speeding or dangerous driving.\\" ==London tunnel runs in the media== The programme Vroom Vroom aired on mainstream satellite channel Sky One carried a report on the tunnel run where presenter Emma Parker Bowles was invited to join the run.YouTube videos available here. Throughout the event, the presenter changed between cars experiencing the many different aspects of a run. A video of a tunnel run has also been made by a tunnel runner so people can appreciate the experience.this can be seen here (the main run begins around minutes into the video) Channel 4's 4car website produced an article detailing a tunnel run event with a gallery of photos.they are available here. Redline Magazine produced an article on London Tunnel Runners in December 2007. ==References== * ","title":"Tunnel running"},{"id":"9096090","text":"right The International Centre for Democratic Transition (ICDT) is a non- profit organization based in Budapest, Hungary which collects the experiences of recent democratic transitions and shares them with those who are determined to follow that same path. Instead of promoting democracy in general, the ICDT sets more concrete and pragmatic goals. The Centre strives to show how dozens of young democracies have made and are making the transition, so that those who set off on this difficult journey from dictatorship to democracy in the future may learn from the successes as well as from the failures. It was founded in 2005. ==Mission statement== Because the International Centre for Democratic Transition was founded in Central Europe, we are acutely aware of the complexity of democratic transition as a process. We ourselves have recently undergone this process and know full well the fragility of new democracies. We firmly believe that a transition can only be judged to be successful when the benefits of democracy are shared by the whole of society. The ICDT‚Äôs mission is to facilitate the smooth and peaceful process of democratic transition on the basis of participatory principles; the political, economic, legal, cultural, and civil societal aspects of transformation; and the socio-cultural context of regions and countries where the process takes place. ==History== The idea to establish an institute to collect and share the experiences of past democratic transitions originated from former US Ambassador Mark Palmer, Vice President of the Council for a Community of Democracies (CCD). His proposal was followed by a meeting between the Hungarian Foreign Minister L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs and the US Secretary of State in June 2004. At a conference in Budapest in March 2005 civil society and governmental leaders from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States, as well as representatives of a number of international organizations approved the concept paper on the new Centre. Subsequently, the idea was presented by the Hungarian Foreign Minister at the Third Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in Santiago de Chile. Once again, the idea was well received and endorsed by the participating Foreign Ministers, representing more than 100 democratic governments of the world. Finally, in September 2005, the President of Hungary announced at the World Summit of the United Nations that \\"an International Centre for Democratic Transition (ICDT) has been set up in Budapest.\\" ==Operational Method== The ICDT: * facilitates the process of democratic transition by using the knowledge pool of transitional experiences and by sharing best practices; * convenes the most important indigenous stakeholders to play key roles in the transition process; * provides an adaptable toolbox and appropriate models for the creation and consolidation of democratic institutions; * mediates between cultures and regions by generating dialogue. ==Key Achievements== * Pursued 23 distinct projects to promote democratic transition and share best practices and lessons learned; * Established a strong presence in Moldova with a series of high-profile projects; * Celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 democratic changes in a dignified way, with a number of conferences and high-level events; * Reached out to over a thousand members of civil society, government officials, and media representatives; * Earned the trust of new donors including the Governments of Estonia, Switzerland, and Luxembourg; * Established a long-term partnership with the Helen Bader Foundation; * Achieved broad international recognition with the publication of A European Alternative for Belarus: Report of the Belarus Task Force; * Published an Open Letter to the Obama Administration, which attracted international attention and debate; * Enlisted Paula J.

Being readable makes it easier for a person unfamiliar with a particular script (or even with programming in general) to understand what the script does. Being expressive allows people to describe actions to be taken using high-level human-task-oriented terms rather than in terms of the low-level operations the computer must perform to carry out those tasks. ==Description== SenseTalk is the primary exemplar of People Oriented Programming, embodying the principles of Intuitive Programming (readable and writable) together with being Task Oriented (very high level) and Human Centric (aligned with human thinking). Readable ‚Äî SenseTalk‚Äôs readability stems from several factors. It is a very English-like language. It uses familiar terms for familiar things, and familiar symbols in familiar ways. Writable ‚Äî SenseTalk supports writability first by being readable and English- like, but also by being very flexible. In many cases, a command, function, or operator can be written in multiple ways. This makes it easy for a user scripting in SenseTalk to write a command without necessarily remembering the exact syntax that is needed. SenseTalk further supports writability by striving for consistency in concepts and approaches to different areas of functionality. For example, the chunk syntax used for accessing chunks of text extends to lists and trees as well. A language that is readable and writable is an Intuitive Programming Language ‚Äî even a person who is unfamiliar with the language will intuitively understand a script if it is clearly readable. And once a person gains a basic familiarity with the language, if it is sufficiently writable they will be able to apply what they know and ‚Äúguess‚Äù at how to write commands to perform tasks that they‚Äôve never done before, and frequently have them ‚Äújust work‚Äù. ==History== The SenseTalk language first appeared in 1992 as the scripting language in HyperSense, a multimedia authoring application for the NextStep platform, modeled after HyperCard. At that time the language was little more than copy of HyperCard's HyperTalk language. A more ambitious rethinking and redesign of the language resulted in the beginnings of the present language, with version 0.02 shipping as the scripting language in Eggplant V1.0 in 2002. The language has continued to grow and evolve, becoming more People Oriented over time, with such enhancements as the addition of support for: * each expressions (similar to \\"list comprehensions\\" in other languages) in V1.26 (2007) * tree data structures (native XML support) in V1.30 (2008) * iterators in V1.36 (2008) * ranges in V1.38 (2009) * direct support for HTTP and XML-RPC in V1.53 (2012) * SQL databases in V1.63 (2013) * units in V1.67 (in 2014) * the SenseTalk Pattern Language (readable regular expressions) in V1.81 (2018) * date formats with readable tokens in V1.91 (2019) * multi-case if statements in V2.00 (2020) ==External links== *SenseTalk - People Oriented Programming *SenseTalk - Intuitive Programming *SenseTalk Documentation *SenseTalk Examples on RosettaCode *Eggplant Software, owners of SenseTalk Category:Scripting languages Category:Programming languages Category:XTalk ","title":"SenseTalk"},{"id":"9096122","text":"Solona was an ancient town of Gallia Cispadana, mentioned by Pliny among the municipal towns of the 8th region (Plin. iii. 15. s. 20), but the name of the Solonates is found also in an inscription, which confirms its municipal rank (Gruter, Inscr. p. 1095. 2).

It is based on the 1957 autobiography Bridge To The Sun by Gwen Terasaki, which detailed events in Teraski's life and marriage.Gwen Harold Terasaki, Author, 84 ==Plot== Gwen Harold, an American woman from Tennessee, meets Hidenari Terasaki (called Terry by his friends and family), the secretary to the Japanese ambassador, while attending a reception at the Japanese embassy in Washington D.C. with her Aunt Peggy and friend Bill. They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her. They begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-Western sentiment. When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the Jim Crow South), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are \\"nice clean young men\\" available. The Japanese ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming that it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries. He seems to hint at possible aggression in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed conflicts with China, keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship. Almost immediately after disembarking and arriving in Tokyo, Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, entering doors after the men and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives. They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs. After having a fight one night when a general says that Terry should be proud that he may have a son to die for the emperor, they make up and she reveals that she was so offended by the comment because she is pregnant. The baby daughter is named Mako. By November 1941, Terry has been reassigned to the embassy in America. They have Thanksgiving dinner in Washington with Aunt Peggy, as World War II embroils the world around them and the U.S. is one of the few powers of the world still at peace. Terry speaks on the phone with his friend Haro. He mentions that Mako, now about five years old, has an apparent illness involving too many antibodies in her blood. He also mentions a possible upcoming invasion of Thailand by the Imperial Japanese Army. Sensing that it may be the last chance for peace between the U.S. and the Empire of Japan, Terry attempts to go over the heads of his superiors and have a cable sent directly to President Roosevelt, alerting him to cable the Japanese emperor to seek to preserve the peace. However, the emperor is rapidly becoming the leader of Japan in name only because of a power struggle with the army leaders. Terry's effort is in vain, as December 7th comes and war is declared shortly after the Japanese attack. Terry calls Gwen after hearing of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the FBI enter and force her to hang up the phone. She decides to accompany Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an Ambassador exchange. A riot nearly occurs as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti- Japanese fervor sweeping the nation in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines and other European- and American-held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia. In Japan, a similar nationalist, anti-American hatred is shown among the citizens. Terry, is less enthusiastic about the war, and attempts to be a mediator for peace, which is dangerous because of the prevailing sentiment and the secret police. Gwen is briefly accosted by a group of soldiers, who try to force her to walk on an American flag. She refuses, and an air raid begins, causing panic in the streets as bombs begin to destroy the area. She sees a crying child and, remembering her daughter, runs to the smoldering school to rescue Mako, who says that children had hit her and called her an American. Later, Terry reveals that he is under suspicion for being disloyal, because he has an American wife, does not belong to any patriotic clubs, and speaks out against the war. Soldiers enter and search the house, and while they don't arrest him, it is clear that he and his family are going to have a rough time as long as they stay in Tokyo. They agree to stay at a friend's empty house outside of the city. As they leave Tokyo, they run into Terry's cousin, Ishi, who has been one of the few people who has been kind to Gwen. Now a soldier, he informs them that he is captain in a kamikaze squadron, and will soon \\"die for a descendent of the sun-god.\\" While taking a train, Gwen sees captured American soldiers, possibly on a death march. They arrive at their new home and meet the young girl who lives there. Terry reveals that he is going back to Tokyo, and that she did not tell her earlier because she would not have gone to stay without him. He offers to arrange her passage back to the U.S., but she refuses, wanting to be close to her husband. As the war continues, food shortages and widespread damage make it clear that things are going against Japan. As the years go on, Terry visits less and less, and Mako grows up not knowing any other existence other than one of perpetual war. Terry returns after months and they enjoy a night's sleep together. They awaken to a visit from a military police officer, who is looking for Terry. As the war continues to turn against them, they begin to suspect disloyalty from anyone critical of the government. Gwen manages to convince them that she has not seen Terry, and they leave. Terry reveals that he has brought a radio, and an American news station announces the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which will be used as a base to launch bombers against mainland Japan. Later on, the surrender of Nazi Germany, Japan's main ally, is also announced, and it is clear that the invasion of Japan is coming soon. Terry and Gwen have a fight one night because he gave away the last of their food. Gwen goes to the village to get her hair done to please her husband, and on her way home, she allows Mako to play in the village, but then a squadron of American bombers and fighters attack. The couple rush to find her, and amid the devastation of the village, they find Mako, alive and unhurt. However, her close friend has been hit and was killed instantly. At the burial, Gwen comments on Mako's jaded reaction, showing no tears or emotion for her friend, because of Japanese customs, as well as growing up during a war. One night, Gwen visits Terry's old friend Hara, who has some power within the party, pleading for him to keep her husband safe. He introduces her to Tokyo Rose, a radio propaganda announcer who tries to lower the morale of enemy armies listening to her broadcasts. They agree to help Terry, but only if Gwen makes an anti-American speech on the radio, recognizing the propaganda value of an actual American denouncing her country. Gwen refuses, and learns that Ishi has been fatally injured and is in the hospital. She visits, and realizing that he is dying, she asks why he had sent his wife away. He reveals that it is because of tradition that he did not want his loved ones to see him die. She returns home in time to see Terry, who had been hiding in the hills to avoid arrest, return. The next day, the entire village arrives at their house, as it is the only one with a radio, for the emperor's radio address. The emperor has never spoken in public before, so they realize he must have major news, possibly surrender. As the village listens to the emperor's voice for the first time, the speech starts: With the war over, Terry asks Gwen to return to her home of Johnson City, Tennessee to put Mako in an American school while she is young and can lose her prejudices against America, to \\"become a bridge between the two nations.\\" Gwen vehemently refuses to leave him. Later on, she finds Terry, who has been overworked, malnourished and ill for many months, standing over his parents' graves. She recalls a speech that he once gave her about visiting the graves of ancestors at times of marriage, birth and death. She also recalls the conversation with Ishi at the hospital before his death when he said that he did not want his wife to see him die. She speaks to Terry's doctor and learns that he has, at most, months to live, and was trying to send his family away because, like his cousin, he didn't want them to see him die. Days later, after Gwen agrees to his final wish to leave for America, Terry sees her and Mako off at the dock. They kiss and embrace for the last time, and Gwen reassures him that they will be expecting him soon, knowing she will never see him again. She holds her composure until he is out of sight, then breaks down and begins crying. As the ship departs, Terry walks down the dock, keeping pace with it until he can go no further. The film ends with Gwen and Terry lovingly meeting each others' gaze for a final time. ==Cast== *Carroll Baker as Gwen Terasaki *James Shigeta as Hidenari Terasaki *James Yagi as Hara *Tetsur≈ç Tamba as Jiro *Sean Garrison as Fred Tyson *Ruth Masters as Aunt Peggy *Nori Elisabeth as Hermann *Emi Florence Hirsch as Mako Terasaki, at different ages *Hiroshi Tomono as Ishi ==Historical accuracy== The memoir narrates the life of Gwen Harold (1906-1990), an American from Tennessee who in 1931 married Hidenari \\"Terry\\" Terasaki (b.1900), a Japanese diplomat. He was first secretary at the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed, was one of the staff who helped translate the Japanese declaration of war and delivered it (late) to the U.S. government and (as Gwen Terasaki wrote in her memoirs) earlier sent secret messages to Japanese pacifists seeking to avert war. The couple and their daughter Mariko were, like all Axis diplomats, interned in 1942 and repatriated via neutral Angola later that year. Terasaki held various posts in the Japanese foreign affairs department up to 1945 when he became an advisor to the emperor, and was the official liaison between the imperial palace and General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander. Mariko and her mother left Japan in 1949 so that Mariko could attend college in Tennessee. Terry died in 1951 in Japan at the age of 50. During the scene in which the Japanese ambassador tries to persuade Gwen to call off the marriage, he seems to hint at a possible conflict between the two countries. However, it is unlikely that he would have been aware of any definitive war aims in 1935, as Japan was still at peace with China. Soon after, Japan would declare war and, in protest against its actions, the United States would issue an oil embargo against Japan, escalating the disagreement between the two and paving the way for war. The speech that Hirohito gives on the radio at the end of the film is a part of the actual recording of the speech that was played to announce plans of surrender. However, Terry's translation for Gwen, is actually only bits and pieces of the much longer speech, even though it sounds as though he is translating it word for word. ==References== ==External links== * *article on Mariko Terasaki Miller *article on Mariko Terasaki Miller as 1998 Outstanding Alumna for East Tennessee State University *Website of the book *Review of film by Bosley Crowther at The New York Times (October 18, 1961) *Bridge to the Sun at TCMDB Category:1961 films Category:1960s romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:Asian- American romance films Category:1960s biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:French films Category:Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer films Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films directed by √âtienne P√©rier Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films scored by Georges Auric Category:English-language French films Category:1961 drama films Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"Bridge to the Sun"},{"id":"9096193","text":"William Bradshaw Bell, OBE, JP (born 9 October 1935), was a Unionist politician from Northern Ireland and former Lord Mayor of Belfast.

It began on August 17, 1862, along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota, four years after its admission as a state. Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war, treaty violations by the United States and late annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota. During the war, the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants, which resulted in settler deaths, and caused many to flee the area. This ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families. A military tribunal quickly tried the men, sentencing 303 to death for their crimes. President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them. The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26, 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota; it was the largest mass execution in United States history. Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them (introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota). In mid-1862, the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent, Thomas J. Galbraith. The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions, and negotiations reached an impasse.Dee Brown Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian American History of the American West, p. 40, Henry Holt, Owl Book edition (1991, copyright 1970), trade paperback, 488 pages, . On August 17, 1862, one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition. That night a council of Dakota decided to attack settlements throughout the Minnesota River valley to try to drive whites out of the area. There has never been an official report on the number of settlers killed, although in President Abraham Lincoln's second annual address, he said that no fewer than 800 men, women, and children had died. Over the next several months, continued battles of the Dakota against settlers and later, the United States Army, ended with the surrender of most of the Dakota bands. By late December 1862, US soldiers had taken captive more than a thousand Dakota, including women, children and elderly men in addition to warriors, who were interned in jails in Minnesota. After trials and sentencing by a military court, 38 Dakota men were hanged on December 26, 1862 in Mankato in the largest one-day mass execution in American history. In April 1863, the rest of the Dakota were expelled from Minnesota to Nebraska and South Dakota. The United States Congress abolished their reservations. Additionally, the Ho-Chunk people living on reservation lands near Mankato were expelled from Minnesota as a result of the war. ==BackgroundPrevious treaties=== The United States and Dakota leaders negotiated the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux on July 23, 1851, and Treaty of Mendota on August 5, 1851, by which the Dakota ceded large tracts of land in Minnesota Territory to the U.S. in exchange for promises of money and goods. From that time on, the Dakota were to live on a 20-mile (32 km) wide Indian reservation centered on a 150 mile (240 km) stretch of the upper Minnesota River. However, the United States Senate deleted Article 3 of each treaty, which set out reservations, during the ratification process. Much of the promised compensation never arrived, was lost, or was effectively stolen due to corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (then called the Office of Indian Affairs). Also, annuity payments guaranteed to the Dakota often were provided directly to traders instead (to pay off debts the Dakota incurred to the traders). ===Encroachments on Dakota lands=== Little Crow, Dakota chief When Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858, representatives of several Dakota bands led by Little Crow traveled to Washington, D.C., to negotiate about enforcing existing treaties. The northern half of the reservation along the Minnesota River was lost, and rights to the quarry at Pipestone, Minnesota, were also taken from the Dakota. This was a major blow to the standing of Little Crow in the Dakota community. The land was divided into townships and plots for settlement. Logging and agriculture on these plots eliminated surrounding forests and prairies, which interrupted the Dakota's annual cycle of farming, hunting, fishing and gathering wild rice. Hunting by settlers dramatically reduced wild game, such as bison, elk, whitetail deer and bear. Not only did this decrease the meat available for the Dakota in southern and western Minnesota, but it directly reduced their ability to sell furs to traders for additional supplies. Although payments were guaranteed, the US government was two months behind on both money and food when the war started because of men stealing food.Reminiscences of Little Crow, An address at the Annual Meeting of the Minnesota Historical Society, DR. ASA W. DANIELS, January 21, 1907, Library of Congress The Civil War was often cited as preoccupying the Federal Government. Most land in the river valley was not arable, and hunting could no longer support the Dakota community. The Dakota became increasingly discontented over their losses: land, non-payment of annuities, past broken treaties, plus food shortages and famine following crop failure. Tensions increased through the summer of 1862. On 1 January 1862 George E. H. Day (Special Commissioner on Dakota Affairs) wrote a letter to President Lincoln. Day was an attorney from Saint Anthony, Mn that had been commissioned to look into the complaints of the Sioux. He wrote: \\"I have discovered numerous violations of law & many frauds committed by past Agents & a superintendent. I think I can establish frauds to the amount from 20 to 100 thousand dollars & satisfy any reasonable intelligent man that the indians whom I have visited in this state & Wisconsin have been defrauded of more than 100 thousand dollars in or during the four years past. The Superintendent Major Cullen, alone, has saved, as all his friends say more than 100 thousand in four years out of a salary of 2 thousand a year and all the Agents whose salaries are 15 hundred a year have become rich.\\"George E.H. Day to Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress, Manuscript Division (Washington DC: American Memory Project 2000-02), The US-Dakota War of 1862, Minnesota Historical Society website ===Negotiations=== On August 4, 1862, representatives of the northern Sissetowan and Wahpeton Dakota bands met at the Upper Sioux Agency in the northwestern part of the reservation and successfully negotiated to obtain food. When two other bands of the Dakota, the southern Mdewakanton and the Wahpekute, turned to the Lower Sioux Agency for supplies on August 15, 1862, they were rejected. Indian Agent (and Minnesota State Senator) Thomas Galbraith managed the area and would not distribute food to these bands without payment. At a meeting of the Dakota, the U.S. government and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew Jackson Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, \\"So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung.\\" But the context of Myrick's comment at the time, early August 1862, is historically unclear. Another version is that Myrick was referring to the Indian women who were already combing the floor of the fort's stables for any unprocessed oats to then feed to their starving children along with a little grass.Anderson, Gary. (1983) \\"Myrick's Insult: A fresh look at Myth and Reality\\", Minnesota History Quarterly 48(5):198-206. The effect of Myrick's statement on Little Crow and his band was clear however. In a letter to General Sibley, Little Crow said it was a major reason for commencing war: \\"Dear Sir ‚Äì For what reason we have commenced this war I will tell you. it is on account of Maj. Galbrait [sic] we made a treaty with the Government a big for what little we do get and then cant get it till our children was dieing with hunger ‚Äì it is with the traders that commence Mr A[ndrew] J Myrick told the Indians that they would eat grass or their own dung.\\"Letter from Little Crow to Col. Henry Sibley(September 7, 1862) AG Report, 35-36 ==WarEarly fighting=== On August 16, 1862, the treaty payments to the Dakota arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were brought to Fort Ridgely the next day. They arrived too late to prevent violence. On August 17, 1862, four young Dakota men were on a hunting trip in Acton Township, Minnesota, during which one stole eggs and then killed five white settlers. Soon after, a Dakota war council was convened, their leader, Little Crow, agreed to continue attacks on the American settlements to try to drive out the whites. Many of the Dakota people, in particular Sisseton Wahpeton tribes, wanted no part in the attacks. Little Crow himself had been initially against an uprising and agreed to lead it only after an angry young brave called him a coward. As a result of a majority of the 4,000 members of the Northern tribes being opposed to the war, their bands played no role in the early killings. Historian Mary Wingerd has stated that it is \\"a complete myth that all the Dakota people went to war against the United States\\" and that it was rather \\"a faction that went on the offensive\\". On August 18, 1862, Little Crow led a group that attacked the Lower Sioux (or Redwood) Agency. Andrew Myrick was among the first who were killed. He was discovered trying to escape through a second-floor window of a building at the agency. Myrick's body later was found with grass stuffed into his mouth. The warriors burned the buildings at the Lower Sioux Agency, giving enough time for settlers to escape across the river at Redwood Ferry. Minnesota militia forces and B Company of the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, sent to quell the uprising, were defeated at the Battle of Redwood Ferry. Twenty-four soldiers, including the party's commander (Captain John Marsh), were killed in the battle.Anderson, Little Crow, 130-39; Schultz, Over the Earth I Come, 48-58; Heard, History of the Sioux War, 73; Board of Commissioners, Minnesota in the Civil War, 2:112-14, 166-81. Throughout the day, Dakota war parties swept the Minnesota River Valley and near vicinity, killing many settlers. Numerous settlements including the townships of Milford, Leavenworth and Sacred Heart, were surrounded and burned and their populations nearly exterminated. ===Early Dakota offensives=== New Ulm, Minnesota\\" by Henry August Schwabe Confident with their initial success, the Dakota continued their offensive and attacked the settlement of New Ulm, Minnesota, on August 19, 1862, and again on August 23, 1862. Dakota warriors had initially decided not to attack the heavily defended Fort Ridgely along the river, and turned toward the town, killing settlers along the way. By the time New Ulm was attacked, residents had organized defenses in the town center and were able to keep the Dakota at bay during the brief siege. Dakota warriors penetrated parts of the defenses and burned much of the town. By that evening, a thunderstorm dampened the warfare, preventing further Dakota attacks. Regular soldiers and militia from nearby towns (including two companies of the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. then stationed at Fort Ridgely) reinforced New Ulm. Residents continued to build barricades around the town. 1912 lithograph depicting the 1862 Battle of Birch Coulee, by Paul G. Biersach (1845-1927) The Dakota attacked Fort Ridgely on August 20 and 22, 1862.Soldiers: 3 killed/13 wounded; Lakota: 2 known dead. Although the Dakota were not able to take the fort, they ambushed a relief party from the fort to New Ulm on August 21. The defense at the Battle of Fort Ridgely further limited the ability of the American forces to aid outlying settlements. The Dakota raided farms and small settlements throughout south central Minnesota and what was then eastern Dakota Territory. Minnesota militia counterattacks resulted in a major defeat of American forces at the Battle of Birch Coulee on September 2, 1862. The battle began when the Dakota attacked a detachment of 150 American soldiers at Birch Coulee, from Fort Ridgely. The detachment had been sent out to find survivors, bury American dead and report on the location of Dakota fighters. A three-hour firefight began with an early morning assault. Thirteen soldiers were killed and 47 were wounded, while only two Dakota were killed. A column of 240 soldiers from Fort Ridgely relieved the detachment at Birch Coulee the same afternoon. ===Attacks in northern Minnesota=== Settlers escaping the violence, 1862 Farther north, the Dakota attacked several unfortified stagecoach stops and river crossings along the Red River Trails, a settled trade route between Fort Garry (now Winnipeg, Manitoba) and Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the Red River Valley in northwestern Minnesota and eastern Dakota Territory. Many settlers and employees of the Hudson's Bay Company and other local enterprises in this sparsely populated country took refuge in Fort Abercrombie, located in a bend of the Red River of the North about south of present-day Fargo, North Dakota. Between late August and late September, the Dakota launched several attacks on Fort Abercrombie; all were repelled by its defenders. In the meantime, steamboat and flatboat trade on the Red River came to a halt. Mail carriers, stage drivers and military couriers were killed while attempting to reach settlements such as Pembina, North Dakota, Fort Garry, St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Fort Snelling. Eventually, the garrison at Fort Abercrombie was relieved by a U.S. Army company from Fort Snelling, and the civilian refugees were removed to St. Cloud. ===Army reinforcements=== Due to the demands of the American Civil War, the region's representatives had to repeatedly appeal for aid before President Abraham Lincoln formed the Department of the Northwest on September 6, 1862, and appointed General John Pope to command it with orders to quell the violence. He led troops from the 3rd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and 4th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The 9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and 10th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which were still being constituted, had troops dispatched to the front as soon as companies were formed. Minnesota Governor Alexander Ramsey also enlisted the help of Colonel Henry Hastings Sibley (the previous governor) to aid in the effort. After the arrival of a larger army force, the final large-scale fighting took place at the Battle of Wood Lake on September 23, 1862. According to the official report of Lieutenant Colonel William R. Marshall of the 7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, elements of the 7th Minnesota and the 6th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment (and a six-pounder cannon) were deployed equally in dugouts and in a skirmish line. After brief fighting, the forces in the skirmish line charged against the Dakota (then in a ravine) and defeated them overwhelmingly. Among the Citizen Soldier units in Sibley's expedition: * Captain Joseph F. Bean's Company \\"The Eureka Squad\\" * Captain David D. Lloyd's Company * Captain Calvin Potter's Company of Mounted Men * Captain Mark Hendrick's Battery of Light Artillery * 1st Lieutenant Christopher Hansen's Company \\"Cedar Valley Rangers\\" of the 5th Iowa State Militia, Mitchell County, Iowa * elements of the 5th & 6th Iowa State Militia ===Iowa Northern Border Brigade=== Blockhouse built as part of a settlers' fort in Peterson, Iowa to defend against anticipated Dakota attacks in 1862 In Iowa, alarm over the Dakota attacks led to the construction of a line of forts from Sioux City to Iowa Lake. The region had already been militarized because of the Spirit Lake Massacre in 1857. After the 1862 conflict began, the Iowa Legislature authorized \\"...not less than 500 mounted men from the frontier counties at the earliest possible moment, and to be stationed where most needed,\\" though this number was soon reduced. Although no fighting took place in Iowa, the Dakota uprising led to the rapid expulsion of the few remaining unassimilated Indians. ===Surrender of the Dakota=== Most Dakota fighters surrendered shortly after the Battle of Wood Lake at Camp Release on September 26, 1862. The place was so named because it was the site where the Dakota released 269 American captives to the troops commanded by Colonel Sibley. The captives included 162 \\"mixed-bloods\\" (mixed-race, some likely descendants of Dakota women who were mistakenly counted as captives) and 107 whites, mostly women and children. Most of the warriors were imprisoned before Sibley arrived at Camp Release. The surrendered Dakota warriors were held until military trials took place in November 1862. Of the 498 trials, 300 were sentenced to death. President Lincoln commuted the sentences of all but 38. Little Crow was forced to retreat sometime in September 1862. He stayed briefly in Canada but soon returned to the Minnesota area. He was killed on July 3, 1863, near Hutchinson, Minnesota, while gathering raspberries with his teenage son. The pair had wandered onto the land of white settler Nathan Lamson, who shot at them to collect bounties. Once it was discovered that the body was of Little Crow, his skull and scalp were put on display in St. Paul, Minnesota. The city held the trophies until 1971, when it returned the remains to Little Crow's grandson. For killing Little Crow, the state granted Lamson an additional $500 bounty. For his part in the warfare, Little Crow's son was sentenced to death by a military tribunal, a sentence commuted to a prison term. ===Trials=== The trials of the Dakota prisoners were deficient in many ways, even by military standards; and the officers who oversaw them did not conduct them according to military law. The hundreds of trials commenced on 28 September 1862 and were completed on 3 November; some lasted less than 5 minutes. No one explained the proceedings to the defendants, nor were the Sioux represented by defense attorneys. \\"The Dakota were tried, not in a state or federal criminal court, but before a military commission. They were convicted, not for the crime of murder, but for killings committed in warfare. The official review was conducted, not by an appellate court, but by the President of the United States. Many wars took place between Americans and members of the Indian nations, but in no others did the United States apply criminal sanctions to punish those defeated in war.\\" The trials were also conducted in an atmosphere of extreme racist hostility towards the defendants expressed by the citizenry, the elected officials of the state of Minnesota and by the men conducting the trials themselves. \\"By November 3, the last day of the trials, the Commission had tried 392 Dakota, with as many as 42 tried in a single day.\\"[ibid.] Not surprisingly, given the socially explosive conditions under which the trials took place, by the 10th of November the verdicts were in, and it was announced that 303 Sioux prisoners had been convicted of murder and rape by the military commission and sentenced to death. President Lincoln was informed by Maj. Gen. John Pope of the sentences on 10 November 1862 in a telegraphic dispatch from Minnesota. His response to Pope was: \\"Please forward, as soon as possible, the full and complete record of these convictions. And if the record does not indicate the more guilty and influential, of the culprits, please have a careful statement made on these points and forwarded to me. Please send all by mail.\\" When the death sentences were made public, Henry Whipple, the Episcopal bishop of Minnesota and a reformer of U.S. Indian policy, responded by publishing an open letter. He also went to Washington DC in the fall of 1862 to urge Lincoln to proceed with leniency. On the other hand, General Pope and Minnesota Senator Morton S. Wilkinson warned Lincoln that the white population opposed leniency. Governor Ramsey warned Lincoln that, unless all 303 Sioux were executed, \\"[P]rivate revenge would on all this border take the place of official judgment on these Indians.\\" Lincoln somehow - despite his many other pressing responsibilities in running the country and conducting the War - completed his review of the transcripts of the 303 trials in under a month; and on 11 December 1862, he addressed the Senate regarding his final decision (as he had been requested to do by a resolution passed by that body on 5 December 1862): :Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females. Contrary to my expectations, only two of this class were found. I then directed a further examination, and a classification of all who were proven to have participated in massacres, as distinguished from participation in battles. This class numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly recommended by the commission which tried them for commutation to ten years' imprisonment. I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on Friday, the 19th instant.\\" In the end, Lincoln commuted the death sentences of 264 prisoners, but he allowed the execution of 39 men. However, \\"[on] December 23, [Lincoln] suspended the execution of one of the condemned men [...] after [General] Sibley telegraphed that new information led him to doubt the prisoner's guilt.\\" Thus, the number of condemned men was reduced to the final thirty- eight. Even partial clemency resulted in protests from Minnesota, which persisted until the Secretary of the Interior offered white Minnesotans \\"reasonable compensation for the depredations committed.\\" Republicans did not fare as well in Minnesota in the 1864 election as they had before. Ramsey (by then a senator) informed Lincoln that more hangings would have resulted in a larger electoral majority. The President reportedly replied, \\"I could not afford to hang men for votes.\\" ===Execution=== The Army executed the 38 remaining prisoners by hanging on December 26, 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota. It remains the largest mass execution in American history. Mankato, Minnesota Wa-kan-o-zhan-zhan (Medicine Bottle) Hanging of Little Six and Medicine Bottle 1865 The mass execution was performed publicly on a single scaffold platform. After regimental surgeons pronounced the prisoners dead, they were buried en masse in a trench in the sand of the riverbank. Before they were buried, an unknown person nicknamed \\"Dr. Sheardown\\" possibly removed some of the prisoners' skin. At least two Sioux leaders, Little Six and Medicine Bottle, escaped to Canada. They were captured, drugged, and returned to the United States. They were hanged at Fort Snelling in 1865.Winks, Robin W. (1960). The Civil War Years: Canada and the United States, Baltimore : Johns Hopkins Press, 1960, p. 174. ===Medical aftermath=== Because of the high demand for cadavers for anatomical study, several doctors wanted to obtain the bodies after the execution. The grave was reopened in the night and the bodies were distributed among the doctors, a practice common in the era. William Worrall Mayo received the body of Ma»üpiya Akan Na≈æi≈ã (Stands on Clouds), also known as \\"Cut Nose\\". Mayo brought the body of Ma»üpiya Akan Na≈æi≈ã to Le Sueur, Minnesota, where he dissected it in the presence of medical colleagues. Afterward, he had the skeleton cleaned, dried and varnished. Mayo kept it in an iron kettle in his home office. His sons received their first lessons in osteology based on this skeleton. In the late 20th century, the identifiable remains of Ma»üpiya Akan Na≈æi≈ã and other Indians were returned by the Mayo Clinic to a Dakota tribe for reburial per the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.Records of the Mayo Clinic. ===Internment=== The remaining convicted Dakota were held in prison that winter. The following spring they were transferred to Camp McClellan in Davenport, Iowa, where they were imprisoned for almost four years. By the time of their release, one-third of the prisoners had died of disease. The survivors were sent with their families to Nebraska. Their families had already been expelled from Minnesota. ===Pike Island internment=== Dakota internment camp, Fort Snelling, winter 1862 Little Crow's wife and two children at Fort Snelling prison compound, 1864 During this time, more than 1600 Dakota women, children and old men were held in an internment camp on Pike Island, near Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Living conditions and sanitation were poor, and infectious disease struck the camp, killing more than three hundred. In April 1863, the U.S. Congress abolished the reservation, declared all previous treaties with the Dakota null and void, and undertook proceedings to expel the Dakota people entirely from Minnesota. To this end, a bounty of $25 per scalp was placed on any Dakota found free within the boundaries of the state.https://open.mitchellhamline.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=none&httpsredir;=1&article;=1261&context;=facsch The only exception to this legislation applied to 208 Mdewakanton, who had remained neutral or assisted white settlers in the conflict. In May 1863, Dakota survivors were forced aboard steamboats and relocated to the Crow Creek Reservation, in the southeastern Dakota Territory, a place stricken by drought at the time. Many of the survivors of Crow Creek moved three years later to the Niobrara Reservation in Nebraska. ===Firsthand accounts=== There are numerous firsthand accounts by European Americans of the wars and raids. For example, the compilation by Charles Bryant, titled Indian Massacre in Minnesota, included these graphic descriptions of events, taken from an interview with Justina Krieger: > Mr. Massipost had two daughters, young ladies, intelligent and accomplished. > These the savages murdered most brutally. The head of one of them was > afterward found, severed from the body, attached to a fish-hook, and hung > upon a nail. His son, a young man of twenty-four years, was also killed. Mr. > Massipost and a son of eight years escaped to New Ulm. > The daughter of Mr. Schwandt, enceinte [pregnant], was cut open, as was > learned afterward, the child taken alive from the mother, and nailed to a > tree. The son of Mr. Schwandt, aged thirteen years, who had been beaten by > the Indians, until dead, as was supposed, was present, and saw the entire > tragedy. He saw the child taken alive from the body of his sister, Mrs. > Waltz, and nailed to a tree in the yard. It struggled some time after the > nails were driven through it! This occurred in the forenoon of Monday, 18th > of August, 1862. S.P. Yeomans, editor of the Sioux City Register, circa May 30, 1863, wrote of the aftermath when the defeated Dakota were shipped to their new homes. > The formerly favorite steamer, Florence,\\" he wrote, \\"arrived at our levee on > Tuesday; but instead of the cheerful faces of Capt. Throckmorten and Clerk > Gorman we saw those of strangers; and instead of her usual lading of > merchandise for our merchants, she was crowded from stem to stern, and from > hold to hurricane deck with old squaws and papooses ‚Äî about 1,400 in all ‚Äî > the non combative remnants of the Santee Sioux of Minnesota, en route to > their new home‚Ä¶. The Dakota have kept alive their own accounts of events suffered by their people.Mark Steil, \\"Exiled at Crow Creek\\", Minnesota Public Radio; Retrieved March 27, 2018. ===Continued conflict=== After the expulsion of the Dakota, some refugees and warriors made their way to Lakota lands. Battles between the forces of the Department of the Northwest and combined Lakota and Dakota forces continued through 1864. In the 1863 operations against the Sioux in North Dakota, Colonel Sibley, with 2,000 men, pursued the Sioux into Dakota Territory. Sibley's army defeated the Lakota and Dakota in four major battles: the Battle of Big Mound on July 24, 1863; the Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake on July 26, 1863; the Battle of Stony Lake on July 28, 1863; and the Battle of Whitestone Hill on September 3, 1863. The Sioux retreated further, but faced Sully's Northwest Indian Expedition in 1864. General Alfred Sully led a force from near Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and decisively defeated the Sioux at the Battle of Killdeer Mountain on July 28, 1864 and at the Battle of the Badlands on August 9, 1864. The following year Sully's Northwest Indian Expedition of 1865 operated against the Sioux in Dakota Territory. Conflicts continued. Within two years, settlers' encroachment on Lakota land sparked Red Cloud's War; the US desire for control of the Black Hills in South Dakota prompted the government to authorize an offensive in 1876 in what would be called the Black Hills War. By 1881, the majority of the Sioux had surrendered to American military forces. In 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre ended all effective Sioux resistance. Andrew Good Thunder and his wife Sarah, a Dakota family who returned to Minnesota after the war ===Minnesota after the war=== The Minnesota River valley and surrounding upland prairie areas were abandoned by most settlers during the war. Many of the families who fled their farms and homes as refugees never returned. Following the American Civil War, however, the area was resettled. By the mid-1870s, it was again being used and developed by European Americans for agriculture. The federal government re- established the Lower Sioux Indian Reservation at the site of the Lower Sioux Agency near Morton. It was not until the 1930s that the US created the smaller Upper Sioux Indian Reservation near Granite Falls. Although some Dakota had opposed the war, most were expelled from Minnesota, including those who attempted to assist settlers. The Yankton Sioux Chief Struck by the Ree deployed some of his warriors to aid settlers, but he was not judged friendly enough to be allowed to remain in the state immediately after the war. By the 1880s, a number of Dakota had moved back to the Minnesota River valley, notably the Good Thunder, Wabasha, Bluestone and Lawrence families. They were joined by Dakota families who had been living under the protection of Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple and the trader Alexander Faribault. By the late 1920s, the conflict began to pass into the realm of oral tradition in Minnesota. Eyewitness accounts were communicated first-hand to individuals who survived into the 1970s and early 1980s. The stories of innocent individuals and families of struggling pioneer farmers being killed by Dakota have remained in the consciousness of the prairie communities of south central Minnesota. Descendants of the 38 Dakota killed, and their people, also remember the warfare and their people being dispossessed of their land and sent into exile in the west. ==Monuments and memorials== *The Camp Release State Monument commemorates the release of 269 European-American captives at the end of the conflict. The four faces of the 51-foot granite monument are inscribed with information about the battles that took place along the Minnesota River during the conflict, the surrender of the Dakota, and the creation of the monument. *Large stone monuments at the Wood Lake Battlefield and in the parade ground of Fort Ridgely commemorate the battles and members of the military killed in action. *The Morton Pioneer Monuments Roadside Park, four miles north of Morton, Minnesota along US highway 71, has two monuments honoring those who died during the Sioux War: The Henderson Monument was erected in 1907 in memory of five members of the Henderson family. It was originally located 1.5 miles southwest but was moved to its current location in 1981. Randor Erle Monument, erected in 1907. Erle was killed on August 18, protecting his father. *The Schwandt State Monument was erected in 1915 to memorialize the six members of the Schwandt family and one family friend. It is located sixteen miles south of Renville, Minnesota along Renville County Road 15. *Redwood Ferry Monuments, honoring those who died at the Ambush on August 18. The monuments are on the north side of the Minnesota River near Morton and are inaccessible to the public. There is a roadside marker located on a bluff above the site along state highway 19 between Morton, Minnesota and Franklin, Minnesota *The Defenders' State Monument, located at Center and State streets in New Ulm, was erected in 1891 by the State of Minnesota to honor the memory of the defenders who aided New Ulm during the Dakota War of 1862. The artwork at the base was created by New Ulm artist Anton Gag. Except for being moved to the middle of the block, the monument has not been changed since its completion. Monument indicating where the thirty-eight Sioux Indians were hanged following the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, Mankato. Placed in 1912, it was removed in 1971 and transferred during the mid-1990s, most likely to the Dakota Tribal government. *In 1912, a four-ton monument was erected at the site in Mankato where the mass execution of the thirty-eight Dakota took place in 1862. In 1971, the City of Mankato, Minnesota removed the monument and placed it in the city storage. In the mid-1990s, it was discovered to be missing. It was possibly transferred to individuals within the Dakota Tribal Government.Dan Linehan, \\"Students search for missing monument as part of history class\\", The Free Press, Mankato, MN, 5/14/2006; Retrieved 1-17-2017. In 1992, the City of Mankato purchased the site and created Reconciliation Park. The mass execution is not referred to, but several stone statues in and around the park serve as a memorial. The annual Mankato Pow-wow, held in September, commemorates the lives of the executed men. Through this observance, the Dakota also seek to reconcile the European-American and Dakota communities. The Birch Coulee Pow-wow, held on Labor Day weekend, honors the lives of those who were hanged. *The Acton, Minnesota State Monument to the first five casualties of the war who were killed in the attack on the Howard Baker farm. There is a roadside marker there as well. *The Guri Endreson- Rosseland State Monument in the Vikor Lutheran Cemetery near Willmar, Minnesota. Dedicated to Mrs. Guri Enderson-Rosseland, who survived an attack at her home, and, in the following days, traveled the countryside assisting wounded settlers. *The White Family Monument, located near Brownton, Minnesota. All four members of the White family were killed on September 22 at their home on Lake Addie. The monument stands near the site of their home. *the Lake Shetek State Park monument to 15 white settlers killed there and at nearby Slaughter Slough on August 20, 1862. *In 2012, for the 150th anniversary of the executions, different types of commemoration were conducted, including an episode of This American Life, and the release of films and documentaries. A group of Dakota rode on horseback from Brule, South Dakota, reaching Mankato on the day of the anniversary. Their journey was filmed as the documentary Dakota 38. The memorial ride has continued uninterrupted since Dakota Elder Jim Miller shared his vision for the ride.Tim Krohn, \\"38 Dakota honored by riders, runners\\", The Free Press, Mankato, MN, 12/26/2018; Retrieved 5-7-2019. ==In popular media== *In the Laura Ingalls Wilder novel, Little House on the Prairie (1935), Laura asks her parents about the Minnesota massacre, but they refuse to tell her any details. *The uprising plays an important role in the historical novel The Last Letter Home (1959) by the Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg. It was the fourth novel of Moberg‚Äôs four- volume The Emigrants epic. These were based on the Swedish emigration to American and the author‚Äôs extensive research in the papers of Swedish emigrants in archival collections, including the Minnesota Historical Society. * These novels were adapted as the Swedish films The Emigrants (1971) and The New Land (1972), both directed by Jan Troell. The latter film particularly portrays the period of the Dakota Wars and the historical mass execution. Stephen Farber of The New York Times said \\"its portrait of the Indians is one of the most interesting ever caught on film\\" and this is \\"an authentic American tragedy.\\" * Poet Layli Long Soldier's poem \\"38\\" is about the massacre and was first published in Mud City Journal and later collected in her 2017 book Whereas. * In 2007, Minnesota House of Representatives member Dean Urdahl published his book \\"Uprising\\" about the events of 1862. In 2009, he published \\"Retribution\\", a sequel. Several works were completed that marked the 150th anniversary of the mass execution: *The This American Life episode \\"Little War on the Prairie\\" (aired November 23, 2012) discusses the continuing legacy of the conflict and mass executions in Mankato, Minnesota, marking the 150th anniversary of the events. *The Past Is Alive Within Us: The U.S.- Dakota Conflict (2013) is a video documentary examining Minnesota's involvement in the Dakota War during the Civil War, which had its major battlefields in the East. It provides both historical information and contemporary stories. *Dakota 38 (2012) is an independent film filmed and directed by Silas Hagerty, which documents a long-distance ride made on horseback in 2008 by a group of Dakota from across the country. They rode from Lower Brule, South Dakota, over 330 miles to reach Mankato, Minnesota on the anniversary of the mass execution there of 38 Dakota men. They made the ride and the film \\"to encourage healing and reconciliation.\\"Dakota 38, 2012, Smooth Feather Productions ==See also== *We-Chank-Wash-ta-don-pee *Indian massacre *Philander Prescott *Fort Ridgely State Park *Monson Lake State Park *Old Crossing Treaty *Upper Sioux Agency State Park *American Indian Wars *List of massacres ==References== ==Further reading== * Anderson, Gary and Alan Woolworth, editors.

An adventure version of the same used for sailing boats is referred to as Sailing weather prediction or Sailing weather routing. The latter focusses more on the forecasting and routing of wind and currents for adventurers and competitive sailors participating in ocean sports like yacht races. Weather forecasting for sailing involves several activities such as weather training and coaching, dissemination of data for use in navigation and route planning software, race modeling which involves historical weather and sea state analysis for yacht and sail design, trip and adventure planning for distance races and record attempts, monitoring for departure and trip weather windows. It involves several type of events such as day races, long-distance races, around-the- world-races, and record attempts. It is routinely used in races such as Volvo Ocean Race, America's Cup campaigns, and olympic classes regattas. ==Weather Routing (Maritime Commercial)== A number of large cargo ships use weather routing services for ocean passages. They are primarily geared towards protecting owners and charterers from speed claims, a secondary use being to reduce fuel consumption and improve ETAs (estimated time of arrival). There exist a large number of such ocean weather routing companies, such as WNI, Ocean routes, Storm Geo AWT(formerly Applied Weather technology), WRI and SPOS. Promoters of weather routing companies cite high fuel savings due to their use, while many mariners tend to be sceptic of their advantages due to a large number of maritime accidents (such as the sinking of the Derbyshire, and the parametric rolling of APL China) and cargo damages that continue to occur even when vessels follow routing advice. Most routing programs employ the Dijkstra algorithm and do not consider the different responses of each ship to the same weather, as the latter is difficult to estimate. ==Long-distance sailboat races== Weather forecasting for long distance races is based on dissemination of meteorological data, most often in GRIB format, for use in navigation and route planning software and yacht characteristics (polars), providing guidance, as well as analysis of historical weather and sea state data. ===GRIB=== GRIB (GRIdded Binary) is a concise data format commonly used in meteorology to disseminate forecast weather data. For sailing purposes the GRIBs are transmitted and received at sea. These GRIBs contain only small subset of surface data, usually winds (direction and wind speed), information about wave strength (proportional to significant wave height) and direction, surface pressure. The data is further reduced by providing its subset around the position of a yacht. The data is transmitted over satellite phones and single side band radios. ===Software for optimal weather routing=== Modern sailing weather forecasting involves transmission of weather forecasts which are used in on-board software which simulates optimal (and safest) routing in distance races. The data is often transmitted in form of GRIB files or similar which are customized for specific areas. These files are suitable for use in popular routing and tactical racing software such as Expedition, MaxSea TimeZero, Adrena, Deckman, Raytech Navigator/Sail Racer, Sailplanner, SailFast, OpenCPN or SailGrib.  Weather routing applications  There are several applications that calculate a yacht's point to point route based on weather prediction and polars (the boat's performance specs): * VRTool regatta tool for sailboats (Windows) * Zezo Sailing Simulator (Web-based) Zezo Sailing Simulator works for various sail racing games and does not support entering one's own boat polars. * PredictWind.com (Web-based, Android & iPhone mobiles) This site advertises \\"outstanding accuracy\\" with no evidence proffered. * savvy navvy (Web-based, Android & iOS) * Sailplanner (Windows, OS X) * OpenCPN Weather Routing Plugin Free Software (Windows, Linux, OS X) * qtVlm (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, Raspberry) * FastSeas (Web-based, automated email responder) * MaxSea (Windows) * SailFast (Windows) * SailGrib (Android) ==Olympic sailing== Weather forecasting for olympic class sailing is a form of nowcasting predicting weather and currents in approximately 0‚Äì6 hours timeframe. Even though understanding of synoptic weather conditions is of importance but mesoscale and local scale events take precedence. The forecast includes predictions of the sea-breeze onset, turbulent winds shifts, coastal jets, changes in tidal currents, fog, as well as wind acceleration and directional changes associated with clouds. ==Yacht design== Weather routing has been used as a simulation tool to assist yacht designers to produce the fastest design for the anticipated conditions of the event, in conjunction with VPP software to predict the boat's performance. The key issue here is that the designer is interested in the outcome using a wide range of likely weather conditions, whereas the navigator on board a yacht is just interested in using the latest weather forecast. Initial attempts in this area used the mean wind speed and direction data from sources such as Pilot Charts, but this is not truly representative, and the correct route is to run the weather routing a large number of times from a set of historical weather records, and then carry out a statistical analysis of the results. Two examples of this follow, both developed by Tim Thornton of Smartcom Software (previously TT Designs). For the 1977 Whitbread Round the World Race, Tracy Edwards' Maiden campaign was hoping to commission a new boat to be built for the event, and went to Tony Castro as the designer. Tony used Tim Thornton to do a comparison of a number of candidate designs, and this was done using 100 different sets of weather conditions for each leg of the race. In the end, the money could not be raised for a new boat, but the weather routing simulation was repeated for the boat she bought, both to optimize the design for the anticipated conditions, and to assist the navigator in developing a strategic plan for the race. For the 1988 America's Cup, the UK's Blue Arrow Challenge followed two routes: designing a monohull strictly in accordance with the Deed of Gift, or a multihull like the American entry. Tim Thornton was engaged by the monohull team to produce an analysis of the optimal design under the Deed of Gift. To do this, he combined his weather routing simulation software with a model that automatically generated possible hull designs and predicted their performance, thereby allowing a large number of design parameters to be investigated rapidly. This showed that, for the anticipated light airs of San Diego, the best design would be a small, light, and heavily canvassed design like an overgrown 18' skiff. ==The Math== This section is not detailed enough to show the statistical tests to determine accuracy and confidence level: for example, with iscochrones or fixed grid points no method to evaluate probability of forecast success is implied or stated. This section seems to be written by non scientists, hence the section name \\"The Maths\\". Weather routing is an optimisation problem, whereby it is required to determine the lowest cost (i.e. shortest time) route across a network, where the cost of traversing each link in the network varies with time, as the wind speed and angle changes, changing the boat's speed. This is generally solved using Dynamic Programming. In most implementations, the boat travels in fixed time steps (e.g. 3 hourly) and at fixed angles (e.g. 5 degree intervals), with distance being the free variable. This results in the creation of isochrones, showing the set of possible positions of the boat at a given time, which are a useful tool for the navigator. However, with this approach it is not easy to compare multiple runs, and so another approach used for design purposes is to navigate across a fixed grid of points, with time being the free variable. This is more amenable to statistical analysis of the ensuing routes. ==References== ==Bibliography== *David Houghton and Fiona Campbell, Wind Strategy, 2005, *Tim Thornton, A Review of Weather Routing of Sailboats, Journal of Navigation Vol. 46 No. 1 pp 113‚Äì129 Category:Weather prediction Category:Marine meteorology and sailing ","title":"Sailing weather prediction"},{"id":"9096360","text":"Johnstown-Monroe High School is a public high school in Johnstown, Ohio.

The term \\"zoological garden\\" refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek Œ∂œéŒøŒΩ, 'zoon', \\"animal,\\" and the suffix -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, '-logia', \\"study of\\". The abbreviation \\"zoo\\" was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1847.\\"Landmarks in ZSL History\\", Zoological Society of London. In the United States alone, zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually. Map of zoos and mini zoos all over the world == Etymology == A Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) at Korkeasaari Zoo in Helsinki, Finland The London Zoo, which was opened in 1828, was initially known as the \\"Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London\\", and it described itself as a menagerie or \\"zoological forest\\".Blunt 1976; Reichenbach 2002, pp. 151‚Äì163. The abbreviation \\"zoo\\" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo, but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song \\"Walking in the Zoo\\" by music-hall artist Alfred Vance. The term \\"zoological park\\" was used for more expansive facilities in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Washington, D.C., and the Bronx in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.Hyson 2000, p. 29; Hyson 2003, pp. 1356-1357. Relatively new terms for zoos in the late 20th century are \\"conservation park\\" or \\"bio park\\". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.Maple 1995, p. 25. The term \\"bio park\\" was first coined and developed by the National Zoo in Washington D.C. in the late 1980s.Robinson 1987a, pp. 10-17; Robinson 1987b, pp. 678-682. In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the Wildlife Conservation Society and re branded the zoos under its jurisdiction as \\"wildlife conservation parks\\".Conway 1995, pp. 259-276. == History  Royal menageries === The Tower of London housed England's royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, British Library). The predecessor of the zoological garden is the menagerie, which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami, hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats.World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, Archaeology Magazine, http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a \\"house of deer\\" built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a zoo called Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena, the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th- century historian W. E. H. Lecky wrote of the Roman games, first held in 366 BCE: Charlemagne had an elephant named Abul-Abbas that was given to him by the Abbasid Caliph. Henry I of England kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.Blunt, Wilfred. The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century. Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15-17. The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the Tower of London, created as early as 1204 by King John I. Henry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century.\\"Big cats prowled London's tower\\", BBC News, October 24, 2005. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions. The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened. Aztec emperor Moctezuma had in his capital city of Tenochtitlan a \\"house of animals\\" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cort√©s reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed. === Enlightenment Era === Versailles menagerie during the reign of Louis XIV in the 17th centuryalt= The oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn in Vienna, Austria. It was constructed by Adrian van Stekhoven in 1752 at the order of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, to serve as an imperial menagerie as part of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial family and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765. In 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was founded by Jacques-Henri Bernardin, with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The Kazan Zoo, the first zoo in Russia was founded in 1806 by the Professor of Kazan State University Karl Fuchs. === The modern zoo === Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King Louis XIV's menagerie at Versailles. The modern zoo that emerged in the 19th century in the United Kingdom, was focused on providing scientific study and later educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration. A growing fascination for natural history and zoology, coupled with the tremendous expansion in the urbanization of London, led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos. London Zoo, 1835 The Zoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Stamford Raffles and established the London Zoo in Regent's Park two years later in 1828. At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo. Originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study, it was opened to the public in 1847. The Zoo was located in Regent's Park - then undergoing development at the hands of the architect John Nash. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo. In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first public aquarium. Dublin Zoo was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead. Downs' Zoological Gardens created by Andrew Downs and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. It was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers and ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, and museum of stuffed animals and birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures and buildings. The first zoological garden in Australia was Melbourne Zoo in 1860. In the same year, Central Park Zoo, the first public zoo in the United States, opened in New York, although in 1859, the Philadelphia Zoological Society had made an effort to establish a zoo, but delayed opening it until 1874 because of the American Civil War. In 1907, the German entrepreneur Carl Hagenbeck founded the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now a quarter of Hamburg. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy. Whipsnade Park Zoo in Bedfordshire, England, opened in 1931. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity with the animals. When ecology emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with Gerald Durrell of the Jersey Zoo, George Rabb of Brookfield Zoo, and William Conway of the Bronx Zoo (Wildlife Conservation Society) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the American Zoo Association soon said that conservation was its highest priority.See Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.): Zoo and Aquarium History, Boca Raton 2001. ; Hoage, R. J. Deiss and William A. (ed.): New Worlds, New Animals, Washington 1996. ; Hanson, Elizabeth. Animal Attractions, Princeton 2002. ; and Hancocks, David. A Different Nature, Berkeley 2001. In order to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The Detroit Zoo, for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.Donahue, Jesse and Trump, Erik. Political Animals: Public Art in American Zoos and Aquariums. Lexington Books, 2007, p. 79.Afrykarium in the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo shows the depths of the Mozambique Channel, where sharks, rays, and other large pelagic fish can be viewed from this 18 meter long underwater acrylic tunnel The Wroc≈Çaw Zoo (), the oldest zoo in Poland opened in 1865 and was home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species (in terms of the number of animal species it is the third largest in the worldWielkie liczenie w zoo we Wroc≈Çawiu. Zobacz, ile zwierzƒÖt w nim mieszka). In 2014 the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo opened the Africarium, the only themed oceanarium devoted solely to exhibiting the fauna of Africa, comprehensively presenting selected ecosystems from the continent of Africa. Housing over 10 thousand animals, the facility's breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 hectares. Mass destruction of wildlife habitat has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as elephants, big cats, penguins, tropical birds, primates, rhinos, exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species and see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.Masci, David. \\"Zoos in the 21st Century.\\" CQ Researcher 28 Apr. 2000: 353-76. Web. 26 Jan. 2014. Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education. === Human exhibits === Ota Benga, a human exhibit in New York, 1906 Human beings were sometimes displayed in cages along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of European and non-European origin. In September 1906, William Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo in New York--with the agreement of Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society--had Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy, displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an orangutan named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the \\"missing link\\" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see Benga.Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo. St. Martins Press, 1992.\\"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy\\", The New York Times, September 10, 1906. Human beings were also displayed in cages during the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, and as late as 1958 in a \\"Congolese village\\" display at Expo '58 in Brussels.Blanchard, Pascal; Bancel, Nicolas; and Lemaire, Sandrine. \\"From human zoos to colonial apotheoses: the era of exhibiting the Other\\" , Africultures. == Type == Monkey islands, S√£o Paulo Zoo Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as lemurs, marmosets, birds, lizards, and turtles. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch. === Safari park === Giraffes in the West Midland Safari Park Some zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with moats and fences, rather than in cages. Safari parks, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals. Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was Whipsnade Park in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4 km¬≤). Since the early 1970s, an 1,800 acre (7 km¬≤) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro. The Werribee Open Range Zoo in Melbourne, Australia, displays animals living in an artificial savannah. === Aquaria === Sea lions at the Melbourne Zoo The first public aquarium was opened at the London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at Battery Park in 1896). === Roadside zoos === Roadside zoos are found throughout North America, particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.Guzoo Animal Farm , website about Canadian roadside zoos, accessed June 18, 2009. Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of neglectRoadside zoo animals starving. Free Lance-Star. 11 Jan. 1997. and cruelty.Dixon, Jennifer. House panel told of abuses by zoos. Times Daily. 8 July 1992. In June 2014 the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Iowa-based roadside Cricket Hollow Zoo for violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to provide proper care for its animals. Since filing the lawsuit, ALDF has obtained records from investigations conducted by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services; these records show that the zoo is also violating the Animal Welfare Act. === Petting zoos === A petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of domestic animals and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby. === Animal theme parks === An animal theme park is a combination of an amusement park and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. Marine mammal parks such as Sea World and Marineland are more elaborate dolphinariums keeping whales, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, both Disney's Animal Kingdom and Gatorland in Orlando, Florida, Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire, England, and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. == Sources of animals == By the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals. This trend, however was and still is somewhat species- specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the International Zoo Yearbook.\\"Zoo: Procurement and care of animals,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008. == Justification  Conservation and research === The African plains exhibit at North Carolina Zoo illustrates the dimension of an open-range zoo. The position of most modern zoos in Australasia, Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the conservation of endangered species, as well as for research purposes and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors,Tudge, Colin. Last Animals in the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped, London 1991. \\"Manifesto for Zoos\\" , John Regan Associates, 2004. an argument disputed by critics. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is \\"the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom.\\" It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the U.S., the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative pathology. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.\\"World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy\\" , World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Conservation programs all over the world fight to protect species from going extinct, but the unfortunate reality is, most conservation programs are underfunded and underrepresented. Conservation programs can struggle to fight bigger issues like habitat loss and illness. To rebuild degrading habitats takes major funding and a massive amount of time, both of which are scarce in conservation efforts. The current state of conservation programs cannot rely solely on situ (onsite conservation) plans alone, ex-situ (off-site conservation) is often needed. Off-site conservation relies on zoos, national parks, or other care facilities to support the rehabilitation of the animals and their populations. Zoos benefit conservation by providing suitable habitats and care to endangered animals. When properly regulated, they present a safe, clean environment for the animals to diversely repopulate. A study on amphibian conservation and zoos addressed these problems by writing, > Whilst addressing in situ threats, particularly habitat loss, degradation > and fragmentation, is of primary importance; for many amphibian species in > situ conservation alone will not be enough, especially in light of current > un-mitigatable threats that can impact populations very rapidly such as > chytridiomycosis [an infectious fungal disease]. Ex-situ programmes can > complement in situ activities in a number of ways including maintaining > genetically and demographically viable populations while threats are either > better understood or mitigated in the wild The breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of endangered species. In Africa, conservation is handled by the African Preservation Program (APP);African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria in the U.S. and Canada by Species Survival Plans;American Zoo and Aquarium Association and the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Australasia, by the Australasian Species Management Program;Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria in Europe, by the European Endangered Species Program;European Association of Zoos and Aquaria and in Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia, by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation, and the South East Asian Zoo Association. Besides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as herons to live in or visit. A colony of black-crowned night herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for more than a century. Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms. == Roadside zoos == In modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population. This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall \\"stock turnover\\" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.Jensen, Derrick and Tweedy- Holmes Karen. Thought to exist in the wild: awakening from the nightmare of zoos. No Voice Unheard, 2007, p. 21; Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth. Zoo: A History of the Zoological Gardens of the West. Reaktion, London. 2002. The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the \\"massive scale of importations.\\" One 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.Goldston, Linda. February 11, 1999, cited in Scully, Matthew. Dominion. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004 (paperback), p. 64. == Animal welfare concerns == Bear cages, one square meter in size, in Dalian zoo, Port Arthur, Liaoning Province, China, in 1997 The welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species.Norton, Bryan G.; Hutchins, Michael; Stevens, Elizabeth F.; Maple, Terry L. (ed.): Ethics on the Ark. Zoos, Animal Welfare, and Wildlife Conservation. Washington, D.C., 1995. Malmud, Randy. Reading Zoos. Representations of Animals and Captivity. New York, 1998. A study examining data collected over four decades found that polar bears, lions, tigers and cheetahs show evidence of stress in captivity.Derr, Mark. \\"Big Beasts, Tight Space and a Call for Change in Journal Report,\\" The New York Times, October 2, 2003. Zoos can be internment camps for animals, but also a place of refuge. A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in. When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382). However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50). === Moral concerns === Some critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.Jensen, p. 48. In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals. === Behavioural restriction === Many modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and behavioural enrichments. This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages. Animals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures. For example, elephants usually travel approximately each day. === Abnormal behaviour === Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. === Shortened longevity === Elephants in Japanese zoos have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long as those in the wild. On the other hand, many other animals, such as reptiles, can live much longer than they would in the wild. === Climate concerns === Climatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, Alaska Zoo had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low. == Surplus animals == Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the most \\"valuable\\" individuals and reduce the risk of inbreeding. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as AZA and EAZA. Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, contraception, sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling). Contraception can be effective, but may also have health repercussions and can be difficult (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals. Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject. Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined. A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial. A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded. Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed. This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births. Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species. == Live feeding and \\"baiting\\" == In many countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal, except in exceptional circumstances. For example, some snakes refuse to eat dead prey. However, in the Badaltearing Safari Park in China, visitors can throw live goats into the lion enclosure and watch them being eaten, or can purchase live chickens tied to bamboo rods for the equivalent of 2 dollars/euros to dangle into lion pens. Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors. == Regulation == WPA 1937 poster promoting visits to American zoos === United States === In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others.Grech, Kali S. \\"Overview of the Laws Affecting Zoos\\", Michigan State University College of Law, Animal Legal & Historical Center, 2004. Additionally, zoos in several countries may choose to pursue accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which originated in the U.S. To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.AZA Accreditation Introduction === Europe === The European Union introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection. Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into effect in 1984. A zoo is defined as any \\"establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition ... to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months\\", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.\\"The Zoo Licensing Act 1981\\" , Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. == See also == * List of zoos * Wildlife refuge * List of zoo associations * Animals in captivity ** Environmental enrichment * Conservation ** Wildlife conservation *** Ex-situ conservation *** In-situ conservation ** Conservation movement ** Index of conservation articles * Virtual zoo * Extinction * Endangered species * Zoo emergency response team * Zoology (includes a list of prominent zoologists) * Immersion exhibit * Frozen zoo == Notes == == References == *Blunt, Wilfrid (1976).

He played there for a year, proving himself as one of the brightest young talents in the country, which recommended him for the Yugoslav youth basketball team. While in China with the national team, he signed a contract with KK Crvena zvezda. He stayed in Belgrade for 3 years, helping Crvena zvezda win the 2004 National Cup. Surviving tough competition in Belgrade, with Scoonie Penn and Igor Rakoƒçeviƒá playing alongside him, he established himself as one of the top guards in the Adriatic League. After a very successful campaign in Belgrade, he moved to BC Dynamo Saint Petersburg, but failed to play a single game there, as the Russian club went bankrupt before the season started. At the peak of his career, without a contract in the middle of competitive season in Europe, he was offered a contract from the most successful Montenegrin basketball team, KK Buduƒánost. To his disappointment, the team did not compete in any of the European basketball competitions. It is, however, a highly competitive team in the Adriatic League, and Jeretin quickly became heart and soul of the talented, but extremely young squad. His average of 18 points per game was just a small piece of his great all around performance this year. He helped Buduƒánost beat KK Crvena zvezda, KK Partizan, KK Union Olimpija among others. His dominant performance in Adriatic League brought him to the attention of one of the greatest European teams, Maccabi Tel Aviv. He signed an 18-month contract with Israeli team in January 2007, playing his first game for the team on 1 February 2007. On 17 July 2007, Jeretin signed for the 2007‚Äì08 season with German club Alba Berlin.Goran Jeretin ist neuer Aufbauspieler der Albatrosse During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Jeretin played for Proteas EKA AEL and then BC Kyiv. On 3 September 2009 he was signed by KK Buduƒánost.Goran Jeretin returns to Buducnost He also played for T√ºrk Telekom B.K. (2010), PBC Lokomotiv-Kuban (2010‚Äì11) and BC Lietuvos rytas (2011). In November he signed a one-year contract with Artland Dragons in Germany.Artland Dragons tab Goran Jeretin to replace Frank Robinson On 12 January 2012, Union Olimpija signed him for one season. On 31 December 2012, Jeretin signed with the Cypriot team AEK Larnaca till the end of the season. ==National team career== While being one of the top guards in Serbia and Montenegro in past few years, he never had a true chance to show his skills in the senior national team, due to tough competition. In an interview given to Montenegrin TV station IN TV, he stated that he would play for the Montenegrin national team. == Post-playing career == Jeretin was a general manager of Sutjeska. ==Player profile== Standing at 192 cm (6 feet 4 inches), he is a combo guard. He is a good ball-handler and passer, and a very good shooter, making him very difficult to guard. He scores in clusters from the perimeter, medium range, as well as while driving to the basket. He is considered quick and strong for a guard, allowing him to play very tough defense. At Buduƒánost, he also showed his ability to perform under pressure, hitting several clutch shots. ==References== ==External links== * ABA League Profile * Euroleague.net Profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:ABA League players Category:AEK Larnaca B.C. players Category:AEL Limassol (basketball) players Category:Alba Berlin players Category:Artland Dragons players Category:BC Dynamo Saint Petersburg players Category:BC Kyiv players Category:BC Rytas players Category:Israeli Basketball Premier League players Category:KK Buduƒánost players Category:KK Crvena zvezda players Category:KK Lovƒáen players Category:KK Olimpija players Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. players Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Lithuania Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Russia Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Serbia Category:Montenegrin men's basketball players Category:PBC Lokomotiv-Kuban players Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from Nik≈°iƒá Category:T√ºrk Telekom B.K. players ","title":"Goran Jeretin"},{"id":"9096401","text":"Fluor may refer to: * Fluor, the name in several European languages of the chemical element Fluorine *Fluor Corporation, multinational engineering and construction firm. *Fluorite, a class of minerals * Fluorophore, a fluorescent chemical compound ","title":"Fluor"},{"id":"9096407","text":"AACT may refer to: * Academy of Arts, Careers and Technology, a career-tech high school in Reno, Nevada * Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, a protein * American Academy of Clinical Toxicology * American Association of Community Theatre ","title":"AACT"},{"id":"9096423","text":"Lakewood High School is a public high school in Hebron, Ohio, United States.

Other names are waveboard, \\"J-board\\", and RipStik (sometimes written \\"rip stick\\"), both of which are derived from commercial brands. A caster board has two narrow platforms known as \\"decks\\" that are joined by a \\"torsion bar\\", which consists of a metal beam, usually coated by rubber, that houses a strong spring. One polyurethane wheel is mounted to each deck with a caster so that each wheel can steer independently, and each caster has a steering axis that is tilted about 30¬∞ back from the vertical. ==Movement== The motion requires that the board be twisted back and forth so as to move either just the back foot or both the front and back feet side to side, essentially pushing the board forward at the outside of the movement, before the foot is brought back in the other direction. In principle, the act is similar to what is required to propel one who is riding inline skates forward, as opposed to how skateboarders push with their feet on the ground. Riding a caster board requires using a twisting motion of hips and legs. A rider or \\"caster boarder\\" gains speed because each wheel is mounted on a 30¬∞ slant on the bottom of each deck. When each deck is pushed to the side, it causes the board to be pushed upward by the wheels' rotation against the gradient of the mounts. This creates potential energy that is then released moves back down under the rider's weight and its own combined. The weight pushing the board back down causes the wheels to turn to face straight again. While riding on a caster board, the increase in height is barely noticeable unless the rider twists the board along the vertical axis too hard, causing stability to be momentarily reduced. Demonstration of usage Caster boarding has been introduced into many school curricula as a means of teaching the basic movement principles that govern board-sports. The success in its ability to engage with pupils not interested in sport was assessed in a 12-week, 6 secondary school case study in the UK carried out by Curriculum Ex. ==Foot placement== Regular stance\\". Riding with the right foot leading is called \\"Goofy stance\\". Foot placement is similar to that of a skateboard. Foot placement is critical on a caster board because one wheel rests under each foot while in use. In order to start with proper foot placement, it is necessary to have the front foot above the center of the front caster and to allow the back foot to give a good push of speed that will allow the board to keep proper balance. Attempting to place the back foot too quickly will make it even more difficult to achieve a desirable foot placement, so it is best to give that foot a maximum of two seconds for it to properly set itself on the board. More experienced riders will be able to place their back feet more quickly. A manual is performed by putting the rear foot on the back end of the rear deck without letting it come off and gently lifting the front foot. If the user is already riding the board and the user recognizes that the foot placement is slightly undesirable, the user could replace both feet simultaneously without interrupting their ride that is already taking place. This is done by the rider's first making sure that they are riding at a normal speed and that the riding surface ahead is stable for riding on and then jumping with both feet at a minimal height that allows both shoes to separate their treads from the grips of the caster board. The rider may continue to \\"hop around\\" the board until a most desirable foot placement is achieved and for as long as a proper speed is maintained. Hopping around may even more easily produce better results than getting off the board and getting back on again. A much more difficult means of replacing the feet while riding is attempting to correct only one foot at a time, increasing the risk of shifting his/her weight too far forward or backward and falling to the ground. ==Steering== In order to steer properly on a caster board, the front foot must lean into the curve while the back foot leans out of the curve. By leaning the front foot in and the back foot out, the front wheel, which will have its front facing inward, is forced to form an arc with the back wheel, which will have its front facing outward. This arcing allows for very sharp turning, but can be exercised for making wide turns as well. While attempting to turn on the board at a higher speed and/or using a tighter arc, the rider leans his/her center of gravity into the turn to keep from falling from the board. However, like all vehicles, there is a limit to the combined sharpness and speed of turning on a caster board without it becoming overturned. It is possible to propel the board while turning by making weaving motions that are typically smaller than those of a relatively straight trajectory. The wrong way to turn on a caster board is to lean both decks in the direction of the turn, which will cause the board to move away from the leaning direction in a parallel-sliding fashion. ==Safety== A helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, gloves, and shin guards are recommended when using a caster board. Falling is common for inexperienced riders. Sunday, May 3, 2020 ==Tricks== A variety of tricks can be done on a caster board.

However, some skateparks have prohibited caster boards. Planet Park (Hachioji city) skatepark in Tokyo, Japan allows only skateboards with four wheels and a single deck.Skatepark self check sheet The Japan Skatepark Association claims that if a caster board rider falls, it can be difficult to predict which direction the board will travel, constituting an unpredictable element of danger that may interfere with other skateboarders, inline-skaters and BMX riders in the park. ==Exercise== The Vigorboard's ability to combine fun with a full cardio-vascular workout has prompted St Helens council to promote the boards in all of its high schools and some of its primary schools, seeing it as a method of inspiring children who wouldn't normally take part in traditional exercise.St Helens Council Project The Vigorboard is proving a valuable weapon in the fight against childhood obesity, with some teachers at the schools currently trialing the boards also reporting drops in truancy, with pupils not wishing to miss school should they miss their Vigorboard session.New Skateboard Project Esclates An independent study conducted by the University of Salford found that vigorboarding resulted in an average increase in heart rate of 227% and a 535% increase in energy expenditure. The study also concluded that vigorboarding results in a 233% greater energy expenditure (407kcal/hr) than walking at 3 mph (174.5kcal/hr).Salford University Study Results Summary In its conclusion, the authors of the university study went on to say, 'Vigorboarding may be a useful alternative to increasing physical activity levels and energy expenditure, especially for individuals that do not wish to participate in the usual sports or activities performed by adolescents.'.Full Salford University Report ==See also== * Freeline skates * Skateboard * Snakeboard ==References== Category:Aggressive skating Category:Skateboarding equipment Category:Human-powered vehicles Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Caster board"},{"id":"9096433","text":"Takamura (written: lit. \\"high village\\" or lit. \\"hawk village\\") is a Japanese surname.

It is the only high school in the Licking Valley Local School District. Its principal is Wes Weaver, the vice principal is Shane Adkins, and the athletic director is Mark McCullough. The current high school building was opened in 2000, and the old one became the current middle school. The new elementary school was built in 2007. The school offers college prep courses and advanced placement courses, and has specialized classes for juniors and seniors to help guide them to the next step, one of which is titled \\"Journey to College\\". The only foreign language course offered is Spanish. ==Academics== In the fall of 2012, Licking Valley High School launched a 1:1 computing program in which every student was issued an Intel Classmate net-book. In preparation, teachers were given laptop computers one year in advance and participated in numerous professional development activities designed to help them take advantage of all students being wirelessly connected to the Internet all day every day. Licking Valley Middle School will follow suit in the fall of 2014 when every middle school student will be issued a Chromebook. During the 2013‚Äì14 school year, district administrators led teachers, students and parents in a conversation about modernizing grading and grading practices. Administrators, teachers and parents read and discussed Ken O'Connor's book A Repair Kit for Grading: Fifteen Fixes for Broken Grades. The result was that there were significant changes made to the grading and grade reporting practices during the 2013-14 school year, some of which were implemented immediately and some of which will be implemented at the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 school year. Many of O'Connor's recommendations have been implemented, including the elimination of zeros as grades, the consequence for not doing or submitting academic work is doing the work; the elimination of grades for homework because homework is practice of a concept and thus formative, not summative; separation of behavioral consequences from the academic grade, meaning not distorting the academic grade with non-academic factors such as attendance, work ethic, etc., these behavioral factors are graded and reported separately on the newly designed grade cards. ==Athletics== The athletic department has been very successful in many sports in the past, particularly football, running up in the Division IV and Division III football State Championships in 2001,2007, and 2019 respectively. The Licking Valley football team has won 11 conference titles in the past 13 years, most recently in the 2012 season, going 7‚Äì3 (6‚Äì1) and barely missing the playoffs, ranking number 10 in Division III Region 11. The softball team, coached by Mark Paxton, won the Division II State Championship in 2013 and made it to the state semi-final round in 2014 before falling to Jonathon Alder 4-3. Boys' and girls' soccer teams have been added to the athletic department. ==Fine arts== The music department includes a Marching Band, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Concert Choir, Women's Choir, and Show Choir. The band is directed by Sean Bradley and the choir is directed by Jessica Myers. Since 2013, the Licking Valley Marching Panthers have been undefeated in Ohio (in their class), they have three superior ratings at State, and went to Finals in the Pittsburgh BOA. The Show choir competed in three competitions and went to Finals at the Sheridan Competition. The Wind Symphony and the Concert Choir are going to State in 2016. Licking Valley High School also includes a Drama Club which in 2015 put on Little Women and is currently putting on Thoroughly Modern Millie in 2016. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * District Website * Licking Valley Athletics Website Category:High schools in Licking County, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio ","title":"Licking Valley High School"},{"id":"9096581","text":"Aadi or Aadhi or AADI may refer to: == Calendars == * Aadi, the fourth month of the Tamil calendar. == Media Film=== * Aadi (2002 film), a 2002 Telugu film. * Aadi (2005 film), a 2005 Kannada film. * Aadhi, a 2006 Tamil film. * Aadi (2016 film), a 2016 Bengali film. ===Actors=== * Aadi (actor), a Telugu film actor. * Aadhi (actor), a Tamil and Telugu film actor. ===Music=== * Aadi (album), a 2005 album by the Syrian singer Asalah Nasri. * Aadhi (singer), the lead vocalist of underground band Hiphop Tamizha. ==Other== * AADI, association of musical interpreters in Argentina, founded in 1957. ==See also== *Aathi, 2006 Tamil language film.

The highest rank he reached was maegashira 12. ==Career== Shunketsu made his professional debut in March 1992, alongside several future top division regulars such as Kyokushuzan, Wakanosato and Takanowaka. He weighed only just over and remained one of the lightest wrestlers in the senior ranks, only managing to put on around in subsequent years. Shunketsu used several different shikona during his career. He began using his own surname, Ishide. Upon promotion to sekitori status for the first time in January 2001 he was given the name Komahikari. However, after falling back to the unsalaried makushita division he reverted to Ishide. He retained this name until November 2005 when he became Shunketsu. Restricted by diabetes and several injuries, Shunketsu took 78 tournaments from his professional debut to reach the top makuuchi division for the first time in March 2005, which at the time was the tenth slowest ever. He spent only five tournaments in makuuchi and only made kachi-koshi there once. He was ranked in the second j≈´ry≈ç division for 25 tournaments. He was the last sekitori from the now defunct Hanaregoma stable, which once produced yokozuna Onokuni. After falling from the top division with a 4-11 record in January 2006 he rarely looked like returning, managing to win more than 8 bouts on only one occasion (in July 2006 when he slid to the bottom of the second division at j≈´ry≈ç 13 West and produced a 10-5 score). From November 2006 to May 2007 he managed four consecutive winning scores (eight wins each time), which took him up to j≈´ry≈ç 1 West, but he had five consecutive losing scores after that. After a 3-12 record in March 2008 at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 11 West, and facing certain demotion to the third division, he announced his retirement. He won one yusho or tournament title in the makushita division (a perfect 7-0 score in November 2000 which earned him automatic promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time), and one in the j≈´ry≈ç division (a 12-3 score in November 2004). ==Fighting style== Shunketsu was predominately a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring grappling as opposed to pushing and thrusting techniques. His favoured grip on the opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, with his right hand outside and left hand inside his opponent's arms. He also regularly employed henka, or sidestepping at the tachi-ai or initial charge. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Saitama Prefecture ","title":"Shunketsu Y≈´ji"},{"id":"9096740","text":"Here We Go Again is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from January to April 1973 on Saturday Night at 8:00pm.

The Lodge and Cabins are part of a National Register Multiple Property Submission, they were submitted with several other state park lodges, all designed by Joseph F.

With the Great Depression in full swing the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) sought to relieve the work needs of unemployed Americans. The National Park Service sought to work with state governments in an effort to meet those ends. Many of the projects the CCC was involved with were construction projects. The project at White Pines was originally meant to be the construction of a lodge building. Two hundred men worked on the State Park construction project at one time, in the years 1933-1939, many of them World War I veterans.Pensoneau, Liz. Yule Love It, Outdoor Illinois, December 2001, Northern Illinois University, Illinois Periodicals Online. Retrieved January 24, 2007. After the lodge was completed, it was decided to build a restaurant and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad from as far away as Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece. As of 2007, the site was home to the sixteen one room cabins and the lodge building, which had been renovated and revamped. Modern amenities were available and the site is operated as a private lodge.Lodge and Concessions Information, White Pines Inn, Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

Retrieved 2 February 2007. When the site was under consideration for the lodge and cabins it had already seen extensive recreational use by the surrounding population. That use threatened to unhinge the delicate balance that existed within White Pines fragile ecosystem. As such, the Illinois State Park Plan, implemented at the time of the lodge's construction, already called for additional state recreational areas in the northern Illinois area to alleviate the burden on White Pines. Because of the concern for conservation at the site, the White Pines State Park Lodge and Cabins is the smallest of the five sites on the Multiple Property Submission. Despite its relative small size, especially compared to the Starved Rock Lodge or the Pere Marquette Lodge, the complex remains faithful to Booton's vision of \\"fanciful forest retreats.\\" ===Lodge=== The lodge was the first structure to be completed at the site. Exterior The lodge building at White Pines is really a combination of two buildings connected by a covered breezeway. The north building contains the lounge and the south building a dining room and kitchen. Both rectangular lodge buildings are of unhewn pine log construction and set on a limestone base. Gable roofs are covered with wood shakes and supported by exposed interior log rafters. Both of the buildings have stone chimneys extending from the large stone fireplaces which form the interior focal point. The building almost comprehensively makes use of wooden logs in its construction, the only non-wood part of the lodge, and for that matter, the cabins, are its stone fireplaces and chimneys. ===Cabins=== The cabins, constructed after initial construction at the lodge was completed, are laid out in a circular pattern north of the lodge. The whole cabin area is ringed by a blacktop road and is set in a stand of white pines.

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, she first appeared in Soulcalibur II and its subsequent sequels, and later appearing in various merchandise and promotional material related to the series. Cassandra has been heavily compared to her older sister Sophitia in terms of fighting style, though with acknowledgment that they were two different characters. Some sources have noted a fan following for the character. ==AppearancesIn Soulcalibur video games=== Cassandra was the younger daughter and middle child of Achelous Alexander and his wife, Nike. She had an older sister, Sophitia, and a younger brother, Lucius, with whom she ran the family bakery in Athens. In Soul Edge, she was mentioned as having witnessed her sister's unconscious body being carried by female ninja Taki after the two successfully destroyed the cursed sword Soul Edge. Taki shared to her the information about a Soul Edge fragment that was lodged near her sister's heart, which Taki was unable to remove because it would kill her. Cassandra resolved never to tell anyone about this, even Sophitia herself. Three years later, she heard her sister had gone to another journey to destroy Soul Edge in Soulcalibur. Unlike her sister, whose skills originated from her weapons and the god Hephaestus, Cassandra was not as humble and could not hear him, relying instead on her own strength. By the time of Soulcalibur II four years afterward, the 21-years-old Cassandra visited her sister's home to find that Sophitia's children Patroklos and Pyrrha were fighting for a fragment of Soul Edge that Sophitia's husband, Rothion, found, making Sophitia restless. She grabbed the fragment and went to the Eurydice Shrine, angrily cursing Hephaestus for endangering her sister. Cassandra stole Sophitia's holy Omega sword after seeing it reacting with the fragment and became determined to find and destroy Soul Edge in place of Sophitia. Cassandra continued her quest to find Soul Edge in Soulcalibur III. She briefly returned to Greece to request Rothion to forge her new weapons after the Omega sword was broken following a skirmish at a corrupted city. He told her that Sophitia had gone to destroy Soul Edge on her own. She visited the city that she went earlier, where she met a man named Raphael who stole her fragment of Soul Edge. Before departing, he told that while she had the power to dispel evil, she was not as strong as the \\"Holy Stone\\". After hearing rumors in the city about a man with a large mass of crystal on his way to Ostrheinsburg Castle, Cassandra reasoned he carried the Holy Stone to fight some evil there, which she theorized was Soul Edge. Therefore, Cassandra went to the castle. Cassandra did not make an appearance in Soulcalibur V, although she was mentioned in the official artbook of the game. According to the artbook, at the conclusion of Soulcalibur IV, she arrived at the Ostrheinsburg Castle and found out that Sophitia had pledged her service to Soul Edge to save Pyrrha, who spent too much time around Soul Edge and had to rely on the sword to survive. Sophitia rendered Cassandra unconscious with a single strike. When she awakened, she found that the entire castle was disintegrating into a realm called Astral Chaos. Cassandra found Sophitia's unconscious body in a room, but as she approached her, Cassandra was sucked to the Astral Chaos while the castle returned to normal. Due to being stranded in the Astral Chaos, Cassandra went into despair and became infested with evil herself, losing the memories of her own identity, and keeping only her desire to save her sister. Soulcalibur VI, set in an alternate timeline, featured Cassandra as the last Season 1 character. In her Story Mode, Cassandra ran the family bakery alongside Lucius while trying to cover for Sophitia's absence. She encountered her future self from the original timeline and found out her sister's tragic fate: she would sacrifice herself by removing the Soul Edge fragment near her heart to ensure Pyrrha could survive after the sword was destroyed. As a result of this revelation, Cassandra set off on a journey to prevent Sophitia‚Äôs tragic future. After the wedding between Rothion and Sophitia, Cassandra was tasked with naming their first child.https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/4/20754158/soulcalibur-6-cassanda- haohmaru-samurai-shodown-dlc Outside of the main series, Cassandra appeared in Soulcalibur: Broken Destinys Gauntlet storyline, a non-canon side story set during the events of Soulcalibur IV, which revolved around Cassandra and her ally Hilde, who was searching for ingredients to develop a potion to cure Hilde's father. To this end, she forced the protagonist to assist them, and later recruited another person, Dampierre, after Hilde was briefly kidnapped. Cassandra also starred as one of the two main characters (and the one most prominently used for promotion) in the mobile card game Soulcalibur: Unbreakable Soul, alongside Edge Master. In it, Cassandra and Edge Master traveled to find the fragments of Soul Edge. ===Other appearances=== Besides the Soulcalibur series, Cassandra appeared in the video game Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 as an unlockable character. To explain the new features of Soulcalibur IV, Namco released an omake manga featuring Cassandra and Hilde; written in a humorous tone, Cassandra, representing a veteran of the series, \\"taught\\" Hilde about the game's features, while introducing the audience to aspects of Hilde's character. Yujin released a four inch tall immobile figurine of Cassandra after the release of Soulcalibur II, based upon her artwork for the title as part of their \\"Namco Girls Series #1\\" line of gashapon figurines. In 2006, Namco released a second Cassandra figurine as part of a Soulcalibur III set based upon her promotional artwork for the game. While not posable, the PVC figure came with three interchangeable weapons for it to hold; an alternate color version was later released in a secondary set. ==Design and characteristics== Cassandra was originally supposed to replace Sophitia in SoulCalibur II; the series' creator and then-producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama said at the time in 2001: \\"We wanted to keep Sophitia's rnodel but make it sufficiently different. I know Sophitia's fans might start to complain, but I think Cassandra should fit into the series.\\"Edge issue 104 page 50. She was designed in mind to have greater determination than Sophitia, with greater physical abilities and skills. To further the contrast between the characters, concept artists emphasized a dress and tights for her instead of traditional Greek attire. Though the rest of the team was initially skeptical of the tights, they warmly received the finished model and heavily praised the decision. Several of Cassandra's animations were done manually by hand and blended with the motion capture-based animations done prior. As a result, the series' production manager noted that it gave some of her movements an uncomfortable appearance, and her proportions seem different from a human being's. ===Gameplay=== When she debuted in Soulcalibur II, Cassandra placed in the middle between the more acrobatic but less damaging characters like Taki and the slower heavy-hitters like Heishiro Mitsurugi, feeling similar to the GameCube version's guest character Link. According to Electronic Gaming Monthly guide to the game, she is \\"very similar to her sister, but not very beginner-friendly. Her attacks are powerful and fairly quick, but can be difficult to string together around. She has fewer juggle moves than Soph.\\"EGM 170 (2003-09) p.110. Andrew Alfonso opined in GameSpy's guide that \\"because of her speed she's best played as an offensive-heavy character\\" and also noted her for having \\"also has one of the best overall moves in the game\\" (for her signature attack Deathfist). She has been radically changed for Soulcalibur IV. In Soulcalibur VI, Cassandra gains a brand new mode called ‚ÄúDivine Force‚Äù, which increases her attack power and allows her to perform special moves, but at the cost of her defense. ==Reception== GameSpy's Christian Nutt noted Cassandra's similarity in Soulcalibur II to her sister in terms of fighting style, but added \\"thanks to some intelligent changes she feels like a whole new gal in many important respects\\". IGN commented on the similarity as well, but added that regardless she played \\"noticeably different\\". PlayStation: The Official Magazine praised her appearance, featuring her in their 2003 \\"Girls of Summer\\" video game character \\"swimsuit\\" special, as well as on the issue's cover. GameDaily described her as a character that \\"grew into her own\\" since her appearance in Soulcalibur II, and later stated her appearance in Soulcalibur IV \\"looked better than ever\\" and described the character as \\"gorgeous\\". Edge praised the changes to her character in Soulcalibur IV, adding that they made her feel like \\"a fresh addition to the series\\". Kotaku's Michael McWhertor also praised her design in Soulcalibur IV in contrast to other females in the series, stating that Namco \\"thankfully [...] exercised a tad more restraint\\" and calling her the female character \\"you'll be picking when Mom comes over.\\" Cassandra was nominated for \\"Baddest Good Girl\\" in G4's Video Game Vixens award show in 2005, which was won by Final Fantasy X's Rikku. She placed as the 12th most popular Soulcalibur character in a poll on Namco Bandai's official English Facebook account of the series in 2015. A poll for the most erotic girl in the history of fighting games by Japanese web portal Goo placed her seventh in 2016.http://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw2426054 IGN's Jesse Shedeen listed Cassandra as one of the series' top ten fighters at number eight in 2008, noting a large fan following and admiration for her \\"spunk.\\" GamesRadar ranked her guest appearance in Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2 with Raphael Sorel, Heihachi Mishima and Ling Xiaoyu at #42 in their list of \\"awesome character cameos\\" in 2010. In 2015, WhatCulture included her in their list of 30 greatest female fighting game characters of all time. ==See also== *List of Soulcalibur characters * Women warriors in literature and culture ==References== Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional Ottoman Greeks Category:Fictional Greek people in video games Category:Fictional characters from Athens Category:Fictional female martial artists Category:Fictional pankration practitioners Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:Soulcalibur series characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2002 Category:Video game guest characters Category:Woman soldier and warrior characters in video games ","title":"Cassandra Alexandra"},{"id":"9096838","text":"Baptist Bible College is the name of two schools in the United States: *Baptist Bible College & Seminary, Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania (The school changed its name to Summit University on April 20, 2015 and later to Clarks Summit University) *Baptist Bible College (Springfield, Missouri) (a branch campus once existed in Massachusetts, now called Boston Baptist College) Baptist Bible College may also refer to: *Free Will Baptist Bible College, Nashville, Tennessee *Heartland Baptist Bible College, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma *Maranatha Baptist Bible College, Watertown, Wisconsin *Northland Baptist Bible College, Dunbar, Wisconsin *Pillsbury Baptist Bible College, Owatonna, Minnesota ","title":"Baptist Bible College"},{"id":"9096844","text":"{ border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" class='infobox' + Queen's University Hockey Club -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Address  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  The Dub, QUB Playing Fields, Upper Malone Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Website  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  www.qubhockey.tk -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Email  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  qubmhc@yahoo.co.uk -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Secretary 2016-17  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  Joaquim Novaes -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Sports  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  Men's Hockey -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Branch  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  Ulster Branch of the IHA -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Founded  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  1898 -----  bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Club Colours  bgcolor=\\"#dfefff\\"  Blue/Green and white or Green/Blue and white } Queen's University Hockey Club Men's Section was formed at Queen's in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The Belfast News Letter reported the Ulster Hockey Union AGM of 19 September 1808, and recorded that \\"a committee meeting was held afterwards when Queen's College Hockey Club was admitted to membership.\\" Queen's was known as a 'College' until it was granted its Charter as a University in 1908. Members are given a \\"years grace\\" in their playing career, to allow them to play one more season after they have left academic study at the University. In 2016-17 the first team plays in Section 1 of the Ulster Senior League. ==Past== In 1911-12 Queen's University were the first club from Ulster to win the Irish Senior Cup on the field of play - Banbridge were awarded the Cup in 1907 when their opponents refused to travel to Ulster to play a Replay. The club won the Irish Senior Cup in 1972 for the second time in its history.Ireland's Saturday Night 08/04/1972 Page 2 The Irish Senior Cup was won again in 1981 when the team was captained by Peter McCabe, later of Lisnagarvey and included future Great Britain Olympic Gold Medal Winner Jimmy Kirkwood. ==Playing Strength== The Club lives from year to year, with fortunes tied to the abilities of the new undergraduate intake each year. Sides vary from being 'useful' to 'formidable', the latter was demonstrated by the 1972 team which beat Monkstown 3-0 in the Irish Senior Cup Final. This side included Great Britain and Ireland International Terry Gregg and several other players that went on to gain International recognition. ==Present== Recently the team has had some significant success, winning the Ulster and Ireland Indoor hockey championships in 2015, therefore gaining qualification to Europe in 2016. With the backing of the university the club were able to send a squad to Bulgaria, who got the opportunities to test themselves against some top level players. Outdoors the 2nd XI won Ulster Junior league 3 in 2014 by an emphatic 12 point margin. Another recent success was winning the UK mixed hockey championship in Blackpool in 2014, finishing top of a 25 team league to go on to win a dramatic play off final on a 1 v 1 shoot out. Being awarded the Queen's SU Sports Club of the Year and Ulster hockey club of year in 2016 boosted the club considerably. Currently the team are playing in the Senior 1 division of Men's hockey in Ulster and are hoping to improve on a disappointing 2nd position last season. ==Future== The future of the club is only as good as the players that are eligible to play for the club, some seasons the club struggles to field a 2nd XI, others it could push for a 3rd XI. However, as long as the commitment and excellent facilities at Upper Malone continue to be taken forward, there should be a future for Queens University Hockey Club. ==Honours== * Irish Senior Cup (3 wins) ** 1911-12, 1971‚Äì72, 1980-81. * Anderson Cup ** 1935-36, 1941‚Äì42, 1956-57. * Linden Cup ** 2005-06, 2006‚Äì07 Irish Indoor cup 2014-15 Ulster indoor cup 2014-2015 ==References== ==External links== *Queens University Hockey Club Hockey Hockey Category:Field hockey clubs in Northern Ireland Category:Sports clubs in Belfast Category:1898 establishments in Ireland Category:Field hockey clubs established in 1898 Category:Women's Irish Hockey League teams Category:University and college field hockey clubs in Ireland Category:University and college sports clubs in Northern Ireland ","title":"Queen's University Hockey Club"},{"id":"9096896","text":"The Samuel M.

Her left-leaning career spanned from the Palmer Raids to the McCarthy Era. ==Background== Barnard College class of 1913 Born August 24, 1895, Carol Weiss was the youngest child of Samuel Weiss and Carrie Stix. Her father was a founder of the law firm of Frank and Weiss (1875-1880), then practiced alone (1880-1910). Her eldest brother, William S. Weiss, continued their father's firm until forced to stop by multiple sclerosis. Another older brother, Louis, also entered his father's first Frank and Weiss, which developed into today's Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. In 1912, Weiss entered Barnard College as a member of the Class of 1916. Archives show many sides of her college life. In 1913, she appeared in a school play, partook in \\"Mysteries\\" (sorority rushing), and played basketball. In 1914, she was known as \\"man- hating\\" yet managed to appear \\"resplendent\\" for the Sophomore Dance. She also joined the managing board of the Barnard Bulletin, whereafter her name appeared as an associate editor. In 1914-15, she was active in the English Club. In 1915, she was involved in the Social Science League, which discussed theories of Scott Nearing and for which she was running as secretary- treasurer. For the Athletic Club, she served as pitcher in 1914. In 1916, she was among many who had not paid her Athletic Association dues but was in good enough standing appear listed as a member in yearbook as well as a committee member for Greek Games. She graduated in 1916. In 1917, she entered law school and in 1920 graduated with a JD in Law from New York University; her brother Louis graduated with a BA in Law from Columbia University, although he started law school a year earlier. ==Career== By the end of 1916, Weiss was \\"doing volunteer work for the American Association for Labor Legislation.\\" In 1917, she was a volunteer research assistant for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). By 1920, as Carol Weiss King, she volunteered to work with Local 25 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). In 1921, she had opened her own law office. In 1923, her name appears in the Barnard Bulletin as \\"lawyer\\" without affiliation stated. In 1924, the communist Daily Worker newspaper listed her as one of their most successful solicitors of subscriptions. That same year, she had formed a \\"loose partnership\\" with radical attorneys. These included Joseph R. Brodsky, Swinburne Hale, Walter Nelles, Isaac Shorr, and Walter Pollak. One of Carol Weiss King's first and most durable relationships was with Pollak, a onetime partner of Benjamin Cardozo, whom she met through her brother-in-law Carl Stern. King, Pollak and Stern worked on the Scottsboro Boys cases, which Pollak successfully argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, among other cases. (Another source cites her as head partner of \\"Shorr, Brodsky, and King in 1925. ) King also associated with left-wing activists, including members of the Communist Party of the United States of America. In 1924, she began to edit the Law and Freedom Bulletin an ACLU digest that recorded state and federal cases involving significant questions of constitutional law. In her 30-year career, she represented hundreds of foreign-born radicals threatened with deportation in administrative proceedings in the lower courts and in the Supreme Court. In 1942, she became general counsel to the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born (ACPFB). Due to her association with controversial clients, King herself was subject to surveillance by the FBI. ==ILD, IJA, ACPFB, NLG== In 1925, she helped Brodsky found the International Labor Defense for the CPUSA (then operating under the name Workers Party of America) and served on its legal advisory committee. In 1931, she became the primary founder of the International Juridical Association. In 1937, she helped found the National Lawyers Guild. In 1942, she became general counsel for the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born, until her death in 1952 In a footnote in his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers notes: > In the early 1930s, Hiss had been a member of the International Juridical > Association, of which the late Carol [Weiss] King, a habitual attorney for > Communists in trouble, was a moving spirit. The International Juridical > Association has been cited as subversive by the Attorney General. Also among > its members: Lee Pressman, Abraham Isserman (one of the attorneys for the > eleven convicted Communist leaders), Max Loewenthal (Max Lowenthal), author > of a recent book attacking the F.B.I. ==Cases== King supported several United States Supreme Court cases including Powell v. Alabama (1932) (the first Scottsboro Boys case) and Herndon v. Lowrey (1937). ===Harry Bridges 1938=== Harry Bridges (1937), whom King defended King's best-known client was union leader Harry Bridges, who faced deportation in 1938 for alleged membership in the Communist Party. The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which reversed the deportation order during World War II. ===William Schneiderman 1940=== King's representation of Communist Party leader William Schneiderman exemplifies her success in enlisting other (male) attorneys to work for free on key constitutional cases ‚Äî in this case, recruiting Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Republican Party presidential nominee, to represent Schneiderman before the Supreme Court. King won this case in 1943, preventing the Government's revocation of the Communist Party leader's citizenship. ===Gerhart Eisler 1947=== King also represented Gerhart Eisler in his trial in July 1947. She accused FBI agent, Robert J. Lamphere, of framing Eisler.http://spartacus- educational.com/Robert_Lamphere.htm After only a few hours of deliberation, the jury brought in a guilty verdict and he was sentenced to a year in prison.http://spartacus-educational.com/Gerhart_Eisler.htm Lamphere asked Eisler as the court was adjourning, \\"Gerhart, do you think you got a fair trial?\\" He replied: \\"Yes, a fair trial but an unfair indictment. Lamphere later recalled: \\"It was the last time I saw Eisler in person; in a way, I almost liked him - his bravado was astonishing.\\" Robert J. Lamphere, The FBI- KGB War (1986) page 62 ===J. Peters 1948=== King also defended \\"red conspirator\\" J. Peters against the INS (named by Louis Budenz and Whittaker Chambers as mastermind of a Soviet underground spy ring operating in Washington, DC, during the 1930s and 1940s) and counseled Peters on how to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) (1948-1949). Although the J. Peters case was among the best known of King's career, Ann Fagan Ginger makes only a single reference to it in her biography of more than 500 pages. ===Sung v. McGrath 1950=== King took on many cases against the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Her most important legal victory came from Sung v. McGrath (339 U.S. 908, 1950). In this case, the Supreme Court acknowledged that INS was subject to the same administrative and procedural rules as all other federal departments. This ruling froze deportation hearings until the INS agreed to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. ===Later=== Carol Weiss King's client Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, shown here (center) in 1913 photo with Paterson silk strike leaders Patrick Quinlan and Carlo Tresca left and Adolph Lessig and Bill Haywood right In 1951, King joined more than half a dozen other lawyers in defending 17 Communist Party members, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. The communists were accused of charged conspiring to \\"teach and advocate violent overthrow\\" of the government. The other lawyers were: Abraham L. Pomerantz, Victor Rabinowitz, Michael Begun, Harold I. Cammer, Mary Kaufman, Leonard Boudin, and Abraham Unger. Later, they were relieved by O. John Rogge, gangster Frank Costello's lawyer George Wolf, William W. Kleinman, Joseph L. Delaney, Frank Serri, Osmond K. Fraenkel, Henry G. Singer, Abraham J. Gellinoff, Raphael P. Koenig, and Nicholas Atlas. King herself made only one appearance before the Supreme Court, in Butterfield v. Zydok (342 U.S. 524, 1952), which she lost. African-American Communist organizer Angelo Herndon was another client. She also represented petitioner Harisiades in the important U.S. Supreme Court immigration law case Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 1952. ==Personal life and death== She married Gordon Congdon King in 1917. Her husband died of pneumonia in 1930, leaving her a widow with one son‚Äîand her work. (Her brother William married 1915 Barnard alumna, Ray Levi. ) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) kept King under surveillance due to her close communist associations. On January 22, 1952, Carol Weiss King age 56 died of cancer. ==Legacy== Barnard College recognized Carol Weiss King in a 1951 issue of the Barnard Bulletin: > Carol Weiss King '16, is a prominent lawyer specializing in immigration > work. She has served as counsel in several well-known cases, including the > Harry Bridges case, for which she was chief counsel up through the U.S. > Supreme Court; and the William Schneiderman case, in which she was co- > counsel with Wendell Willkie. Mrs. King has also published numerous articles > for law reviews. Other alumnae who appeared in that article include poet Leonie Adams Troy ('22), author Irma Simonton Black ('27), and Margaret Mead ('23). The National Lawyers Guild's Immigration Project presents the Carol King award each year in Ms. King's honor to an outstanding immigration advocate. Walter Pollak's son, Senior U.S. District Judge Louis Pollak (who married King's niece), wrote the foreword to Ann Fagan Ginger's 1993 biography of Carol Weiss King. ==Works== * \\"The Sacco-Vanzetti Case is not Dead,\\" New Masses (1933) ==See also== * International Labor Defense * Joseph R.

Cain was raised in Chicago and Michigan after his parents divorced. He joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 and was stationed in the United States Virgin Islands from 1947 to 1950. While there, he became fluent in Spanish. Before returning to Chicago in 1951, Cain worked as an investigator at the Burns Detective Agency in Dallas, Texas.\\"Cain played mob game and lost big\\", Chicago Tribune, 21 December 1973, pp. 1, 8. Despite his grandfather having been a prominent sewer contractor who was killed by the Chicago Outfit in Little Italy, in 1928,\\"Cain's grandfather slain defying Mafia\\", Chicago Tribune, 30 December 1973, p. 5. Cain would later become a close associate of Sam Giancana. While Cain worked as an officer in the Chicago Police Department (CPD) during the mid-1950s, he served as a bagman between corrupt police officials and the Outfit. ==Double deal and disgrace== Taking a leave of absence from the CPD in 1960, Cain was assigned as an investigator for Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Ogilvie in his investigation of Outfit boss Anthony Accardo. Cain alluded to having been deported from Mexico in 1961 after helping train Cuban-Americans for the Bay of Pigs invasion. After his death, \\"Washington sources\\" confirmed \\"off-the-record\\" that these claims were true.\\"Cain was on move with big schemes\\", Chicago Tribune, 28 December 1973, p. 16. He also claimed to have worked with the U.S. State Department \\"tracing the flow of American money into Communist hands.\\" Cain returned to Chicago in early 1962 to support Ogilvie in his campaign for Cook County Sheriff. In 1962, Sheriff Ogilvie appointed Cain to be the chief investigator of the Cook County Sheriff's Office. In 1964, Cain was fired for lying to a grand jury regarding his involvement in the recovery of stolen drugs. Cain was convicted of perjury. He served six months in prison concurrent with a four-year sentence from 1968 for being an accessory to a bank robbery. Cain was paroled in 1971. ==Informant and murder victim== After parole, Cain made \\"frequent trips\\" to and from Mexico as Sam Giancana's courier and financial adviser. Cain became a key figure in Giancana's money skimming from casinos in Central America and Iran. During this time, conspiring to control the city's illegal gambling operations, he began working as an FBI informant for Agent William F. Roemer, allegedly muscling out his rivals by revealing their operations to federal authorities. On December 20, 1973, Cain was killed by masked gunmen in Rose's Sandwich Shop in Chicago. Witnesses reported that no more than 15 minutes before the attack Cain had been talking with four other men who were not present when the gunmen arrived. Two of these four men were reported to have left using a back door. At the time of the gunmen's arrival, Cain was seen talking with an unidentified woman in black. The gunmen carried a shotgun, a pistol, and a two-way radio that they used to communicate with an outside lookout. They ordered the shop's staff and patrons (including Cain) against the wall but did not speak directly to Cain. They asked several of them if they had any money and asked, \\"Who's got the package?\\" Cain was approached, pulled slightly away from the wall, and shot in the head with the shotgun. As he fell, the second gunman also shot him in the head. Cain's assailants reportedly removed an item from one of his pockets before fleeing. The unidentified woman apparently left at the same time as the gunmen.\\"Ex-Cop Cain shot to death\\", Chicago Tribune, 21 December 1973, p. 1\\"Police seeking mystery woman in Cain slaying\\", Chicago Tribune, 22 December 1973, p. 1\\"Cain's belongings, friend being sought\\", Chicago Tribune, 24 December 1973, p. 3 ==Possible murder motives== During the early 1970s, Cain became involved in a burglary ring masterminded by Outfit capo Marshall Caifano. It has been speculated that Caifano had learned of Cain's informant status and had received permission from Accardo to murder Cain. Caifano was reported to have been in Rose's Sandwich Shop only two hours before Cain's murder.\\"Police seeking mystery woman in Cain slaying\\", Chicago Tribune, 22 December 1973, p.1 After Cain's death, the Chicago Tribune reported that Cain had once bugged Caifano's bedroom.\\"Cain bugged hood's home\\", Chicago Tribune, 22 December 1973, p. 3 Cain was also reported to have been \\"arguing violently\\" with senior Outfit figure Gus Alex shortly before Cain's death over Cain's plans to organize 12-day gambling cruises for Chicago high-rollers off the Florida coast.\\"Probers: Cain sought to lure gamblers away\\", Chicago Tribune, 25 December 1973, p. 3 Several Chicago Tribune articles printed in the days after Cain's death reported speculation by investigators that Cain's murder was in retaliation for the murder of Sam DeStefano the previous April.E.g. \\"Who Killed Richard Cain?\\", Chicago Tribune, 23 December 1973, section 2, p. 4 ==Alleged involvement in the JFK assassination== According to a biography of Sam Giancana written by his family, Giancana told his younger brother that it was Cain and Charles Nicoletti, not Lee Harvey Oswald, who were in the Texas Book Depository on November 22, 1963.Giancana, Chuck and Sam Giancana, Double Cross: The Explosive, Inside Story of the Mobster Who Controlled America. New York: Warner Books, 1992. . According to Michael J. Cain, there was no evidence to support the rumors that his half-brother was directly involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy as a gunman. Richard Cain was at the Criminal Courts Building 26th & California, Chicago, Illinois the day of the Kennedy assassination - per John J. Flood WWW.IPSN.ORG who worked with Richard Cain. According to historian Lamar Waldron in his book The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination (2013), Richard Cain did not shoot the president but acted as an informant on behalf of mobster John Roselli for the Chicago assassination attempt planned for November 2, 1963. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Ashman, Charles.

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, he first appeared in Soul Edge and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. He is one of only four characters to have appeared in each of the games. == Creation and conception == As a character introduced in Soul Edge, Cervantes's weapon was initially a rapier, selected before other elements of the character and designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. As development progressed, the development team felt that the weapon choice made the character seem too \\"gentlemanly\\" (although the concept would later be used for Raphael Sorel), and changed it to a pair of swords, which were expanded upon to be the first appearance of the series' recurring weapon, Soul Edge. His design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. The inspiration for a pirate as the game's antagonist was derived from two other fictional pirates, Captain Hook and Long John Silver. When developing his swords, many different styles were considered, including the concept of the swords appearing as wisps of spiritual energy. Elements of these designs were utilized in subsequent appearances of the Soul Edge weapon in later titles. When the character's design was modified to appear in Soulcalibur, one of the swords was changed to a pistol sword, with the curve on the weapon's blade emphasized in comparison to its counterpart. ==Appearances== Cervantes de Leon was the son of Philip de Leon (who is also the paternal grandfather of Ivy Valentine), a privateer who was sent on a mission by the King of Spain to loot in the name of Spain. Following a disastrous attack on an English warship that killed Philip, Cervantes forsook his allegiance to his king and became a pirate. Receiving an order from a wealthy merchant, Vercci to find the cursed sword Soul Edge, Cervantes voyaged through the sea and eventually found the sword in the possession of an English dealer. However, the sword gradually corrupted him until his soul was devoured by it. Having murdered all of his crew, Cervantes boarded his ghost ship, the Adrian, on a reign of terror for twenty years until he was defeated and killed by the combination efforts of Greek warrior Sophitia and Japanese ninja Taki. However, Cervantes was accidentally resurrected without his memory by Nightmare because of the Soul Edge fragments lodged in his body. For the next three years, he decided to search for the cursed sword despite knowing that it had robbed him of his free will while slowly recovering his memories. Upon the shattering of Soul Edge, Cervantes began his quest on collecting the fragments of the cursed sword for four years which melded to form a weapon for him, attacking other ships that came close to his sea. When the presence of Soul Edge's other half vanished, Cervantes's body began to weaken as the fragments that sustained him crumbled. He was informed by a servant of Soul Edge, Tira, that a powerful entity was the one responsible, so Cervantes sought to defeat the entity and preserve his life. Eventually, Soul Edge summoned all pieces of itself back to it. Cervantes followed its trail, intending to wield the sword once it completed itself. Along the way, he devoured the soul of his illegitimate daughter, Ivy, but after the latter had survived thanks to her artificial soul, Ivy retaliated and defeated Cervantes, releasing all souls he had consumed, including hers. His body beaten and his mind shattered, Cervantes was swallowed by a dimensional rift opened by Soul Edge, the Astral Chaos. Seventeen years later, during the wake of the 17th century, people reported the presence of Cervantes' ship, the Adrian, voyaging through the sea; Cervantes had been released from the Astral Chaos, now free from Soul Edge's control and at his height of power. The rebooted timeline serves as a retelling of Cervantes' resurrection after his death, and how he regains his power and confronts his daughter. In the non-canonical Gauntlet storyline of Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny, Cervantes' soul was required as payment for Ivy to create a potion for character Hilde and her party to cure her father. Though they attempted to renegotiate, they were forced to find and take Cervantes' soul by force. ==Design== During development, several designs were considered for Cervantes, with the initial concept appearing as a clean-shaven man with long hair tied in a pony tail and a raised-collar coat. This and several subsequent designs were eventually rejected, however, as the development team felt they were either too reminiscent of nihilistic pirates or gentlemanly in appearance. Taking a different approach, they designed his appearance as a tall male with a trim mustache and white hair extending to the base of his neck. A blue coat with an extended tail covered his upper body, with thick gloves extending past his wrist and a large hat covers his head. White pants cover his lower legs, surrounded by leather armor on his upper thighs, and armor plating covering his lower legs and upper chest, with a neck scarf resting atop the breastplate. His design was intended to orient the viewer's eye towards his left, with his hat angled in the opposite direction. When designing the character's appearance in Soulcalibur, several zombified designs were considered, with varying states of decay. As the series progressed his mustache was expanded into a growing beard, while his skin tone developed a purplish hue. His pupils were additionally negated, giving his appearance either solid white or red glowing eyes, depending on the game. His attire developed a more pronounced barbed appearance as well, with the gradual expansion of his breastplate, and the addition of a red loin cloth by Soulcalibur IV. In contrast, his secondary character model has remained throughout the series. Originating as a full body suit of armor with faceplate, initial appearances incorporated a large cape and small metal face mask, initially intended to cover Cervantes' entire face. In Soulcalibur, large spikes were incorporated into the arms and legs of the armor, while the cape was adapted into a metal \\"tail\\" for the lower half. In Soulcalibur III an open-face helmet replaced the mask, while in Soulcalibur IV, elements of both were combined together. While the purplish hue added to his skin was retained as the series progressed, his facial hair changed game by game, either appearing clean shaven or with a simple mustache, depending on the title. Cervantes was designed in mind to be something of a ghost pirate. Starting with Soul Edge, Cervantes had peach skin, long white hair with a violet tint and blue eyes and sported a full mustache. His attire consisted of a traditional pirate captain's uniform. When under the influence of Soul Edge, his skin gained an unnatural purple tint and his eyes turned yellow with the sclera turning black. He retained this appearance with very minute modifications into Soulcalibur. After returning from the dead as a specter, his skin became even paler than before and his eyes were purely white, although his mustache has grown past his cheeks and reaching his hairline. His attire had also changed to feature lighter colors and armor with the additions of gauntlets and greaves and wore a new jacket loosely on his back. In Soulcalibur III, his skin pigment became a light purple and his hair turned fully white and becoming spiky. His appearance showed off more skin to reveal impressive musculature with his facial hair now fully forming a long beard. His clothing was now similar to his earlier appearance but has also taken on a purple, darker sheen, and his gloves are now the same color. In Soulcalibur IV, his appearance seems to have been even further corrupted than before, with claw-like shoulder pads with purple eye decorations with an additional one on his hat and his coat becoming wing-like with segmented metal linings. As of Soulcalibur V, he seems to have reverted to normal and his look is similar with his original Soulcalibur appearance, his hair and skin's pigment returned to their natural color and his clothing although he keeps his facial hair and length. His clothing returns to a more traditional appearance but now featuring a red and black color scheme and a Jolly Roger emblem on his boots and belt. His coat opens up to reveal his bare chest, showing off chest hair. His bonus costume on the other hand, gives him a suit of armor but his physical body appears to give off a fiery glow and aura with his face seemingly internally consumed by fire, resembling Soul Edge to an extent. Cervantes utilizes his two swords in combat to execute a variety of moves that take advantage of both weapons, many of which involve impaling his enemy or firing the pistol from the short sword for a long-range attack. Perhaps his most recognizable move is the \\"Flying Dutchman\\", in which he crouches and delivers multiple stabs to the enemy's midsection with extreme speed. This attack has been featured in several games as one of his signature techniques. In Soulcalibur II, many of his weapons are named after the rivers of Hades, such as Lethe, Phlegethon and Styx. His fighting style also seems to be inspired in part by Niten Ichi-ry≈´, as evidenced by his normal stance. == Reception == Since his introduction Cervantes has been well received, with his fighting style serving as an element to compare to for later characters in fighting games. In 1997, PSM included \\"a wickedly evil villain\\" among the three reasons why Soul Edge \\"is the best Namco fighting game ever.\\" In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of Soulcalibur II regarding their favorite character, he tied with Maxi for fourth place with 11% of the tally. UGO.com ranked Cervantes at seventh place in their \\"Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters\\" article, describing him simply as \\"a big jerk\\" while praising him as one of the stronger characters in the series. IGN listed him third on their list of the top ten characters in the series, citing his offensive techniques as a large part of his appeal. They additionally named him one of their ten favorite sword-wielding characters in video games, describing him as combining two of their favorite elements-\\"big swords and pirates\\"-into a singular character, adding that his pistol weapon \\"makes him even more awesome.\\" Den of Geek editor Harry Slater shared the sentiment, naming Cervantes the seventh best character in fighting games and adding that while the character had become overshadowed by others in the series, he was \\"a brute, plain and simple\\". In 2012, Complex ranked Cervantes as the 41st \\"Most Dominant Fighting Game Character\\". In 2013, they enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking him the fifth best character. ==References== Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Fictional assassins in video games Category:Fictional criminals in video games Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional pirates Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional Spanish people in video games Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:Fictional torturers Category:Ghost characters in video games Category:Male characters in video games Category:Namco antagonists Category:Soulcalibur series characters Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters introduced in 1995 Category:Video game characters who can teleport Category:Video game nobility ","title":"Cervantes de Leon"},{"id":"9096939","text":"Samuel ben Kalonymus he-Hasid of Speyer (), was a Tosafist, liturgical poet, and philosopher of the 12th century, surnamed also \\"the Prophet\\" (Solomon Luria, Responsa, No. 29). He seems to have lived in Spain and in France. He is quoted in the tosafot to Yebamot (61b) and So·π≠ah (12a), as well as by Samuel b. Me√Ør (RaSHBaM) in his commentary on Arbe Pesa·∏•im (Pes. 109a). He was the first of the Chassidei Ashkenaz, and the father of Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg. Samuel was the author of a commentary on the treatise Tamid, mentioned by Abraham b. David in his commentary thereon, and of a liturgical poem, entitled Shir ha-Yi·∏•ud, divided into seven parts corresponding to the seven days of the week. This poem is a philosophical hymn on the unity of God, for which Ibn Gabirol's Keter Malkut served as the basis. Like the latter, Samuel he-·∏§asid treats of the divine nature from the negative side, that is to say, from the point of view that God is not like man. The Hebrew, if not very poetical, is pure; but foreign words are used for the philosophical terms. The recitation of the poem was forbidden by Solomon Luria; but other rabbis, among whom was Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen, who wrote a commentary on it, decided to the contrary. On the different opinions concerning the authorship of the Shir ha-Yi·∏•ud see L. Dukes in Orient, Lit. vii., cols. 483, 484.

In the early 1960s, Woody Guthrie was living on Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island, New York. Although Bob Dylan made a pilgrimage to visit Guthrie, who was physically deteriorating due to a neurological disorder called Huntington's Disease, the town of Okemah had no interest in remembering its native son.Marroquin, Danny. Walkin' the Long Road PopMatters.com. Aug. 4, 2006. Retrieved Sept. 19, 2007. Okemah residents regarded Guthrie with some suspicion and some believed he was a Communist based on his \\"Woody Sez\\" column published in a Communist paper The People's World. In addition, Guthrie sang out his beliefs at labor union rallies - sometimes with other outspoken artists such as Pete Seeger and Cisco Houston. As late as 1971, the Okemah City Council refused to proclaim Woody Guthrie Day due to his radical politics.Curtis, Gene. Only in Oklahoma: This man was our man. Tulsa World, March 17, 2007. Retrieved Nov. 19, 2007. By the 1970s, although most young people in Okemah had never heard of Guthrie, Guthrie- followers began making pilgrimages to Okemah to visit the house where Guthrie lived. Guthrie's son Arlo - a well-known folksinger himself by the 70s - also made occasional trips to Okemah \\"to feel the situation out.\\" Twenty years after Woody Guthrie died and approximately ten years before the first festival, Minnesota musician Larry Long decided to continue in the footsteps of Woody Guthrie and become a traveling troubadour. With a grant from the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the Oklahoma Arts Council, Long moved to Okemah and began working with Okemah school students in the Oakes Elementary School and in the Okemah Middle School where he became an artist- in-residence. Over several years Long managed to garner support from local residents to have the students participate in a Woody Guthrie tribute concert.Cox, David.

The organization's goal was to hold an annual event to not only honor Woody Guthrie, but to also raise funds for the education of local youth. This organization eventually morphed into the Woody Guthrie Coalition Inc. However, it wasn't until the late 1990s, when Billy Bragg visited Okemah filming scenes for his Man in the Sand documentary about the making of Mermaid Avenue, a collection of unknown Guthrie lyrics put to Bragg's music in collaboration with Wilco, that the town of Okemah started to fully embrace its wiry wanderlusting native. Bragg fittingly christened the first festival in 1998. In an article for Dirty Linen Annette C. Eshleman wrote: \\"Residents' attitudes have gone from angry accusations of Guthrie being a Communist, to suspicious tolerance, to embracing his legion of loyal fans.

When the attempt failed and the Florentine government protested, he was forced by Bessarion, his employer, to write an apology to Poggio.John Monfasani, George of Trebizond: A Biography and a Study of His Rhetoric and Logic, Brill Publishing, 1976, page 122. Perotti was so incensed by the number of errors in Giovanni Andrea Bussi's printed edition of Pliny's Natural History that the wrote to the Pope asking him to set up a board of learned correctors (such as himself) who would scrutinise every text before it could be printed.Martin Davies, \\"Humanism in script and print in the fifteenth century\\", in Jill Kraye, The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism, page 57. This has been described as the first call for censorship of the press.John Monfasani, \\"The First Call for Press Censorship: Niccol Perotti, Giovanni Andrea Bussi, Antonio Moreto and the Editing of Pliny's Natural History\\", Renaissance Quarterly, 41 (1988):1-31. He himself was later accused by another scholar of introducing 275 serious errors in the text when he produced his own version of the work.Anthony Grafton, 'Conflict and Harmony in the Collegium Gellianum' in Holford-Strevens and Vardi, The Worlds of Aulus Gellius, Oxford University Press (2004), page 335; Elizabeth L.

It is situated in Ogden Union Station, along with the Utah State Railroad Museum, John M. Browning Firearms Museum, Kimball Classic Car Museum, and Myra Powell Gallery. The Cowboy Museum contains the Utah Cowboy Hall of Fame, which is associated with the Ogden Pioneer Heritage Foundation. The museum plans to expand to include a research center in the future. The museum was established in 2012, with a grant from the state of Utah, to honor the cowboy, along with those men and women whose lives exemplify the independence, resilience and creativeness of the people who settled Utah and continue to champion the Western way of life. This includes artists, champions, competitive performers, entertainers, musicians, ranchers, writers, and persons past and present who have promoted the Western lifestyle. The museum was established under the auspices of the Ogden Pioneer Days Foundation, who asked Susan Van Hooser to chair the establishment of the museum. She and her committee only had about six weeks to accomplish that goal. It was only open for the month of July that first year, but by the following year the museum committee, with the help of a benefactor and the Foundation were able to find a location within the Union Station building, which is rapidly being outgrown. The museum endeavors to collect Western artifacts that paint a historical picture of the diversity related to the establishment and development of our Western ethic, including those accessories that are peculiar to the American cowboy. Although at present - June 22, 2018 - we do not have room for a library, we have collected quite a few books relating to Western history, arts and crafts, and reprints of old catalogues showing styles of spurs, saddles, hats and various western memorabilia. We also have quite a few books dealing with the history, culture and crafts of the Native American. In addition we have photographs, histories - oral and written - documenting Utah's Western culture and its people, including Native Americans. It is hoped that in the not too distant future, these items will be available for research purposes. Each year applicants for the Hall of Fame can be submitted. A committee of individuals not connected to the museum are provided with a packet for individuals submitted. Through an individual and private voting process, with up to three votes taken to narrow the field, the winners are determined. The first part of July the inductions are carried out at Union Station. Anyone interested can attend the induction ceremony free of charge. ==Selected Hall of Fame inductees== A selected list of notable inductees to the Utah Cowboy Hall of Fame includes: *Gary Cooper (1901-1961) *Grant Speed (1930-2011), cowboy artist - 2014 *Earl W.

Is it a force for evil?\\" It was first published in 2006. Looking at the evidence from history, philosophy, sociology and psychology, Ward focuses on the main question at issue: does religion do more harm than good? He begins by examining the key area of religion and violence and goes on to assess the allegations of irrationality and immorality, before exploring the good religion has done over the centuries. He suggests that without religion the human race would be considerably worse off and there would be little hope for the future. ==Summary== In the Introduction: What is religion?, Ward begins, \\"Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil, even 'the root of all evil'?\\"‚Äîthe title of a short British television series presented by Richard Dawkins. Ward states his view that the assertion that religion does more harm than good ignores \\"the available evidence from history, from psychology and sociology, and from philosophy\\" and suggests that proponents of this view \\"refuse to investigate the question in a properly rigorous way, and substitute rhetoric for analysis\\". He suggests that it is impossible to give a satisfactory universal definition of religion, and that early opponents of religion such as Edward Taylor, James Frazer and √âmile Durkheim were indulging in \\"scholarly fantazising\\" about forms of primitive religion which were refuted by more rigorous studies such as Theories of Primitive Religion by Evans-Pritchard. \\"Unfortunately some writers have not yet realised this\\", such as Daniel Dennett in Breaking the Spell, who \\"does not seem to realise that the spell was broken as long ago as 1884 when E. B. Tylor was appointed to a Readership in Anthropology at Oxford University.\\" In Chapters 1 through 3, which deal with the origins and nature of violence, Ward suggests that \\"It is not religion that causes intolerance. It is intolerance that uses religion\\", that \\"The leaders of such movements [are] using moral and religious language as a cloak for evil and irreligious ends\\", and that \\"religions are not the causes of evil, but they do naturally share in the general moral state of the societies in which they exist\\". Ward suggests that any organised human activity can be corrupted, and that the corruptions of religion, although highly regrettable, are less harmful that the corruptions of secular ideologies (Nazism, Leninism and Maoism all claimed the support of science). In addition the great religions have within themselves a powerful critique of corruption. Ward, alluding to Islamic terrorism, alleges that \\"it is not religion that causes Islamic terrorism. It is a version of Islam that has been corrupted by ...Marxist-Leninism\\" and that al-Qaeda is based on a demonstrably incorrect interpretation of Islam. He further suggests that wars fought in the name of some interpretations of Christianity have also been based on distortions. Ward examines the interplay of reason, morality, and philosophy in Chapters 4 through 8. He claims that the statement \\"the only reasonable beliefs are those that can be confirmed by the methods of science, by public observation, measurement and experiment\\" is self-refuting. He contrasts four worldviews‚ÄîCommon Sense, Materialism, Idealism and Christian Theism‚Äîand suggests that there are serious problems with Common Sense (science shows that things are often not in fact as they seem at all) and Materialism (\\"quantum physics seems to dissolve matter entirely\\", and \\"consciousness and the contents of consciousness resist translation into purely physical terms... and if ... truth, beauty and goodness ... are things that really exist ... then Materialism will not match our experience at all\\"). He suggests that \\"many attacks on religion are based on the belief that idealism is false. There is no spiritual dimension to reality... to make matters worse, thinkers like Richard Dawkins hold that...religious views are based on 'blind faith'\\". But, he asks, \\"Has Dawkins never read any philosophy?... Does he really think that Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza, Kant and Hegel were all unthinking simpletons?\\" \\"Looking around my philosopher colleagues in Britain, virtually all of whom I know at least from their published work, I would say that very few of them are materialists... the point is that religious views are underpinned by highly sophisticated philosophical arguments\\". He discusses the defensibility of worldviews and suggests some criteria that make a worldview reasonable: # Clarity and precision in stating the beliefs, ideally arranged in order of logical dependence so that one can tell which are the truly basic beliefs # Comparison with other worldviews # Testing the adequacy of the worldview to the widest range of data, whether they are experiences or other beliefs Ward asserts that it is rational, and not harmful, to believe in life after death. He advises that \\"even for the most conservative Christian, moral rules found in the Bible should not be taken out of context\\" and that \\"far from being considered dangerous, religious morality is widely considered to be a valuable resource for moral thinking in the modern world\\". He explains how his own journey from atheism, when he was a philosopher teaching at Glasgow University, was strongly influenced by the need to have a philosophically coherent justification for morality. Ward avers that the history of Europe from the 16th to the 20th Centuries was not one of \\"beneficial liberation from fear and superstition\\" but \\"an age of increasingly aggressive nationalism culminating in two world wars ... barbarism did not decrease. In the twentieth century it reached heights never previously imagined\\" and that religiously inspired individuals took a leading role in many beneficial developments. He suggests that \\"it was religion, and not secular thought, that propounded the view that nature is founded on a deep rationality\\", and defends liberalism and pluralism in religious thought, which he attributes to the rise of Protestantism and contrasts with what he considers the illiberal attitudes of Richard Dawkins and Enlightenment thinkers like David Hume, who sought to make reason the slave of passions. referring to Hume's view that \\"Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them\\" [A Treatise of Human Nature II.iii.3/415] In Chapters 9 and 10, Ward attempts to demonstrate the benefits of religion. Ward quotes data from David Myers citing surveys by Gallup, the National Opinion Research Centre, and the Pew Organisation which conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being \\"very happy\\" than the least religiously committed people. The Myers book is cited as The Science of Subjective Well-Being (Guilford Press 2007) He reports an analysis of over 200 social studies that \\"high religiousness predicts a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with life and a sense of well-being\\", and a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that \\"concluded that a large majority of these studies showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem, and lower levels of hypertension, depression and clinical delinquency,Bryan Johnson & colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania (2002) and similar results from the Handbook of Religion and Mental Health.Handbook of Religion and Mental Health Harold Koenig (ed.) He cites surveys suggesting a strong link between faith and altruism.e.g. a survey by Robert Putnam showing that membership of religious groups was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organisations He cites extensive studies to show that there is little or no evidence that religion ever causes mental disorders, quoting Michael Argyle and others and that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health. He specifically addresses and rebuts the claim that religious belief is a delusion. He quotes the definition in the Oxford Companion to Mind as \\"a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs\\" suggesting that \\"most great philosophers have believed in God\\", and that the many religious people who exhibit a high degree of rational ability \\"... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs\\" refute the idea that belief in God is a delusion‚Äîwhether or not it may be mistaken. He also analyses and rejects the idea that faith is a brain malfunction, quoting Gerald Edelman: \\"The evolutionary assumption [that consciousness conferred fitness]... implies that consciousness is efficacious - that is, it is not an epiphenomenon\\", quoting Edelman's Bright Air, Brilliant Fire and suggests that, if consciousness can apprehend truth and cause action, so can faith. Ward suggests that, although harm has been done in the name of religion, the same is true of politics and science, that religion can \\"be used to inspire heroic love and commitment. The world would be much poorer without Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Mother Teresa... Bach ... St Francis, Siddartha Gautama, Jesus\\". He cites many positive contributions made by Judaism, Christianity (he cites in particular founding hospitals, hospices, schools and universities, great works of art, the investigation into the world as the creation of one wise and rational God that gave birth to modern science, the Truth and reconciliation commission, and the Red Cross) and Islam, and suggests that \\"there is plenty of room for common social action in mercy and hospitality between Christians and Muslims, and it is imperative that such commonalities are promoted\\". He concludes by stating that Religion \\"is the compassionate heart of what might otherwise seem to be a cold and heartless world\\". ==Reviews== * Richard Holloway in The Scotsman * The Good Bookstall review * ==Notes & references== ==Sources== * * I I I ","title":"Is Religion Dangerous?"},{"id":"9097201","text":"Ant√≥nio Henrique Rodrigo de Oliveira Marques (23 August 1933 ‚Äì 23 January 2007) was a Portuguese historian. ==Life== Oliveira Marques was born in the 'freguesia' of S.

His PhD dissertation was entitled Hansa e Portugal na Idade M√©dia (Hanseatic League and Portugal in the Middle Ages). In 1962, his participation in student strikes against the right-wing regime of Oliveira Salazar resulted in his dismissal from the university as a scholar. He left for the United States where he taught history at a number of universities (Auburn, Florida, Columbia, Minnesota and Chicago) between 1965 and 1970. Oliveira Marques returned to Portugal in 1970, but only resumed teaching at Portuguese universities in 1974, the year in which the Carnation Revolution ended almost five decades of the Estado Novo regime. From October 1974 to April 1976, he was director of the National Library of Lisbon. In 1998, he was granted the Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty, a state accolade which distinguishes figures who have made a contribution to the values of civilization. ==Work== Considered one of Portugal's greatest experts on Portuguese Medieval history, he wrote more than 60 books and numerous articles.

Hungary water (sometimes called \\"the Queen of Hungary's Water\\", Eau de la Reine de Hongary, or \\"spirits of rosemary\\") was one of the first alcohol-based perfumes in Europe, primarily made with rosemary. The oldest surviving recipes call for distilling fresh rosemary and thyme with brandy, while later formulations contain wine, lavender, mint, sage, marjoram, costus, orange blossom and lemon. == Origins == The exact date of the invention of Hungary water is lost to history, though some sources say it dates to 1370 or the late 14th century. It is equally unclear who in particular created it. According to legend, it was formulated at the command of the Queen Elizabeth of Hungary, sometimes identified as Queen Isabella of HungaryHistorically, the name Isabella was a variant of Elisabeth, and in the period in question the two were sometimes interchangeable. or in one document \\"Saint Elisabeth, Queen of Hungary\\".This may be a conflation of multiple individuals. Some sources say that a hermit or monk-recluse first gave it to the Queen of Hungary, though most likely it was made by a court alchemist or a monk-alchemist. The water was given to the queen in order to help her headaches. These legends mostly date to the early to mid-17th century, so the details may have become confused in the intervening centuries. === Namesake === The queen in question is frequently assumed to be Elisabeth of Poland (1305‚Äì1380), although the particulars of her life do not match those in the more common legends. It is even more unlikely that it could be Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1207‚Äì1231), who is additionally too early and not a queen.The technique of distillation only became well known in Europe between about 1150 and 1250. The only plausible Queen Isabella (late 13th century) likewise seems to be too early to be a strong candidate, as the invention of this water is most probably related to the Black Death epidemic that ravaged Europe between 1346 and 1350 caused by a bacterial infection. This could potentially be due to the antibacterial effects found in the wine or brandy and rosemary that was used to make the water. == Spread through Europe == According to legends, Hungary water first appeared outside of Hungary in 1370 when Charles V of France, who was famous for his love of fragrances, received some. Its use was popular across Europe for many centuries, and until Eau de Cologne appeared in the 18th century, it was the most popular fragrance and remedy applied. === French Hungary water === By the 18th century, French Hungary water from Montpellier was being touted over other variations of Hungary water, because of the quality of the rosemary used in the distillation. Advertisements in newspapers even warned against counterfeit versions of French Hungary water, explaining to potential buyers how to detect the difference in quality. == Medicinal Use == Hungary water was used during the late 17th century as a form of medicine. It was believed to have many uses such as helping to relieve a headache, toothache, or ringing ears. It was also used to help cleanse the body by clearing out several of the vital organs of impurities. Some even believed that it helped reduce blindness and the inability to hear. It was one of the medicines at the time that could be considered a \\"cure all\\" meaning that it would help with almost every ailment a person could face. The medicine was made through a distillation process that included concentrating the ingredients involved, which often included rosemary and wine. Hungary water as a medicine was used for men, women, and children alike. The dosage was only 1-2 sips of the medicine or have it applied topically depending on if the ailment was internal or external == Other Uses == Similar to other herb and flower-based products, Hungary water was also a valuable remedy, with recipes advising the user to wash with it or drink it in order to receive the most benefit. Other times, it was recommended to be added to other prepared distilled waters to use when washing ones face in order to help prevent irritation and breakouts. It was even thought to help people maintain youthful appearance and beauty. ==Notes== == References == == See also == * Toilet water * Florida Water * Eau de Cologne Category:History of cosmetics Category:Perfumes Category:Traditional medicine ","title":"Hungary water"},{"id":"9097249","text":"Pressure Drop is the second solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1975.

At 27,000 sq. ft., it is the largest such indoor exhibit in North America, and one of the largest in the world. The museum is on the lower level of the Casa de Balboa Building on the Prado in Balboa Park.Locator map The museum is open Tuesday through Friday 10 AM - 4 PM, Saturday & Sunday 11 AM - 5 PM and is closed on Mondays. Nearly three million people have passed through the center since it opened in 1982. The San Diego Model Railroad Museum is a 501(c)(3) organization non profit charity. A model of the San Diego Union Station at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum along with a number of model trains. ==History== Model railroading in Balboa Park began at the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition. In the 1930s, pioneer model railroader Minton Cronkhite designed and directed the construction of a number of scale model railroads in the 1930s, including a large exposition O scale model railroad in Balboa Park. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, as well as Pennsylvania Railroad, hired him to create giant model railroads for world fairs to stimulate interest in train travel and help revive the national economy during the years of the Great Depression. His 40-by-70-foot model railroad exhibit was the \\"chief transportation feature\\" of the 1935 exposition. The San Diego Model Railroad Museum opened in 1982 with a mission to \\"preserve the heritage of railroading through a series of miniature representations of California railroads, research and preserve the history of model railroading, and educate the public in the many different aspects of railroading.\\" ==Exhibits== With 27,000 square feet (2508 m¬≤) of exhibit space, the museum is home of some of the largest HO and N scale layouts of their types. There are two massive HO scale layouts, a N scale layout, a O scale layout, and a Lionel type 3-Rail O gauge Toy Train gallery. * Cabrillo & Southwestern (O scale). This layout is a freelance representation of a route from San Diego to Sacramento. * Pacific Desert Lines (N scale). Based on a rail line that was surveyed but never built, this layout features handlaid Code 40 track (0.040 inches - 1 mm high) and 33 scale miles (1,089 actual feet - 331 m) of mainline track. * San Diego & Arizona Eastern RR (HO scale). This layout is based on the prototype San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway line from San Diego Union Station eastward through Carriso Gorge to the desert floor at El Centro. * Tehachapi Pass (HO scale). This two-level layout represents the joint Southern Pacific / Santa Fe railroad from Bakersfield to Mojave, California, of the 1950s, including the Tehachapi Loop. The model is unique for its size and geographic fidelity. Thousands of photographs of the prototype were used to closely model the details of the actual area with nearly curve-for-curve and switch-for-switch accuracy. * Toy Train Gallery (3-Rail O gauge). A 42 by 44 foot permanent layout that has four separate main lines, realistic scenery, and many operating accessories. Club members control the trains with modern remote control systems such as LEGACY by Lionel and DCS by MTH. This gallery features operating toy trains of \\"Lionel type\\" 3-Rail O gauge, a collection of rare Lionel and American Flyer cars from the 1920s though the 1950s, and modern toy trains from Lionel, MTH, K-Line, and Atlas-O. There is also an interactive kids layout where children of all ages can push a button to run a train. ==Library== The museum has a specialized library related to both model railroading and real railroads. The library has a collection of books, magazines, VHS tapes, blueprints and other materials for research. It is a reference library and the materials do not circulate, but it is open for any attendee of the museum. ==Railroad clubs== The model railroads were built and are maintained by four local railroad clubs, which exhibit their respective displays as nonprofit organizations.

Located in the county seat of Sullivan, the courthouse has been listed since 1995. ==HistoryEarlier courthouses=== Moultrie County, Illinois was first settled around 1820. By 1842, local residents wanted a more local representation in government. That Fall, residents presented a petition to the state government to form a new county out of parts of Shelby and Coles Counties. The county was officially formed on February 16, 1843; it was named after Col. William Moultrie. East Nelson was chosen as the first county seat, but residents could not agree on a suitable location for the courthouse. The county held a second election for county seat and Asa's Point, which would thenceforth be known as Sullivan, was chosen as the site. The first courthouse was built in 1847. It was destroyed in a fire on November 25, 1864. The next year, plans were made for a new courthouse, built with local materials. It was completed in 1866. In 1896, the north side of the courthouse was host to a lynching. Grant Atteberry was imprisoned under accusations that he assaulted a local woman. An angry mob stormed the courthouse and demanded that the sheriff release the man to their custody. The sheriff agreed and the man was hanged from a tree on the northwest corner of the courthouse lawn.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201149.pdf ===Present courthouse=== By 1904, the courthouse was deemed too small for county needs and plans for a new courthouse were approved. Deal & Ginsel were selected as architects and H. B. Walters of Danville, Illinois was appointed contractor. Work started some time between August and December 1904 and the courthouse was completed on August 6, 1906. Since its completion, the building has housed functions of county government. Its Circuit Courtroom has been a popular location for community functions because of its large size. From about 1907 to 1930, the courthouse was home to the Moultrie County Farmers' Institute, a popular three-day educational meeting co-sponsored by the University of Illinois College of Agriculture. The most noteworthy trial to take place was the embezzlement trial of Jimmy Steel and Z. B. Whitfield of the Merchants & Farmers State Bank in 1921. On April 20, 1995, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Moultrie County, Illinois Category:County courthouses in Illinois Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Neoclassical architecture in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Moultrie County, Illinois ","title":"Moultrie County Courthouse"},{"id":"9097303","text":"Angelides is a surname.

AVR acts as a feeder line connecting its many and varied customers to Class I railroads such as CSX Transportation (CSX) and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), and regional lines such as the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad (B&P;) and the modern Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (WE). The AVR's mainline travels northward through Pittsburgh from an intersection with Norfolk Southern near Panther Hollow, before splitting in the Lawrenceville neighborhood. The AVR uses the P&W; Subdivision segment of the line to cross the Allegheny River on the 33rd Street Railroad Bridge to interchange with the B&P; in Bakerstown and/or Evans City. The other segment serves industries along the railroad's namesake valley between Pittsburgh and Arnold. The Glenwood B&O; Railroad Bridge is utilized by it as part of its W&P; Subdivision branchline from the city to the exurb of Washington, Pennsylvania. A short spur line is the newest addition to the AVR's portfolio; it links the Allegheny Valley line with Sharpsburg via the Brilliant Branch Railroad Bridge. Before this section opened in 2003, the bridge and stretch of track had sat unused since 1976. The AVR owns the Glenwood Yard in the Hazelwood neighborhood of Pittsburgh. They operate five GP11 engines, and three SD40 engines. AVR has also begun to conduct transloading operations within Glenwood Yard itself, handling limestone unit trains and also sand for fracking. ==History== The current company, established in 1992 is a separate entity from the original Allegheny Valley Railroad, which was established in the 1850s. That line, affiliated with the Pennsylvania Railroad system, followed the present company's tracks to Arnold and continued beyond, along the right upstream (southeastern) bank of the river to Oil City. The original Allegheny Valley Railroad transported oil from the vicinity of Oil Creek and Titusville. On February 20, 1861, The Pittsburgh Post printed \\"The Allegheny Valley Railroad (Extracts from the Eighth Annual Report, which is important for the light thrown on the transportation of oil).\\" On February 5, 1862, The Pittsburgh Gazette and Commercial Journal published \\"Allegheny Valley Railroad--Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\\" In October 1995, the Allegheny Valley Railroad began operations when Trimax (now Carload Express) acquired Conrail‚Äôs Valley Cluster in the Pittsburgh area. The railroad began interchanging with CSX at the Glenwood Yard in Pittsburgh in 2001. In December 2003, the Allegheny Valley Railroad expanded by leasing and operating of track from CSX, consisting of the P&W; Subdivision and the W&P; Subdivision. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused $3.2 million in damage to a section of the P&W; Subdivision, which the railroad repaired and restored. In 2006, the Allegheny Valley Railroad restored and began interchanging with the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway in Bruceton. The railroad began a $10 million renovation of switching operations at Glenwood Yard in 2008. Positive train control began being implemented along the railroad in 2014. On May 15, 2019, the Allegheny Valley Railroad acquired of track from CSX that it had leased and operated since 2003. Under this acquisition, the Allegheny Valley Railroad gained ownership of the Glenwood Yard, the W&P; Subdivision, the Tylerdale connecting track, and the P&W; Subdivision.https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-08811 ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Allegheny Valley Railroad railfan page Category:Pennsylvania railroads Category:Predecessors of the Pennsylvania Railroad Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1852 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1891 Category:Switching and terminal railroads Category:Spin-offs of Conrail Category:Companies operating former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad lines Category:Companies operating former Pennsylvania Railroad lines Category:Transportation in Pittsburgh Category:1852 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Allegheny Valley Railroad"},{"id":"9097328","text":"Joseph Raymond Sarnoski (January 31, 1915 - June 16, 1943) was an officer of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and received the Medal of Honor posthumously. Sarnoski was part of the flight crew of Capt. Jay Zeamer Jr. on Old 666 on the day where both he and Zeamer earned the Medal of Honor. ==Life and careerChildhood=== Sarnoski was the second-oldest in a family of seventeen children belonging to a Polish coal miner in Simpson, Pennsylvania, just north of Carbondale. His father's health began to fail and he left the coal mines to begin farming where Joseph Sarnoski worked hard to help keep the farm operating and make ends meet. The family later moved to nearby White's Crossing, where Sarnoski graduated from high school. Though the responsibility of alternating between education and farm work left little free time, Sarnoski developed an interest in aviation. ===Military career=== On March 7, 1936, Sarnoski enlisted in the United States Army as an air cadet, entering service in Baltimore, Maryland. After basic training he was assigned to the 2nd Bomb Group at Langley Field, Virginia, with additional training at Lowry Field, Colorado, where he completed the Advanced Aircraft Armorer's Course in 1939. In 1940 he was discharged from the Regular Army to reenlist in the Air Corps in order to train as an air crewman, completing the Bombsight Maintenance Course. Sarnoski was promoted to Sergeant, made an enlisted bombardier in B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and returned to Langley as part of the 41st Reconnaissance Squadron, attached to the 2nd Bomb Group. While stationed at Langley Sarnoski met and married his wife, Marie, and was promoted to Staff Sergeant early in 1941. In September 1941 Sarnoski was transferred to Dow Field, Bangor, Maine, as a bombing instructor with the 65th Bombardment Squadron, 43rd Bomb Group, newly equipped with B-17s. With the entry of the United States into World War II, Sarnoski's group was transferred to Australia on January 13, 1942, where in March he was promoted to technical sergeant. Sarnoski continued to act primarily as an instructor but did fly some combat missions and earn promotion to Master Sergeant. In November 1942, now based at Port Moresby, New Guinea, he volunteered to become part of a combat crew put together by 1st Lt. Jay Zeamer Jr.. Sarnoski was awarded the Silver Star in combat and by recommendation of his pilot received a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on May 24, 1943. ==Medal of Honor mission== On June 16, 1943, Sarnoski, normally a bombardier, volunteered to fly as one of the crew of B-17E, AAF Ser. No. 41-2666, Old 666 on an unescorted mission to Buka, a small island off the north coast of Bougainville, a 1200-mile round-trip mission, to photograph Japanese installations and map the west coast of Bougainville as far south as Empress Augusta Bay in preparation for Allied landings scheduled for early November 1943 in World War II. Apparently unbeknownst to Allied intelligence, the Japanese had moved about 400 fighters into the Solomon Islands on June 15. The photo reconnaissance mission was without incident, although the B-17's crew reported observing 20 fighters taking off from Buka airfield. The bomber continued south to the mapping run and shortly before its completion, the B-17 was intercepted by five Japanese fighters attacking from the front. Though wounded in the attack, Sarnoski continued to fire his nose gun, shooting down two fighters. A 20-millimeter cannon shell exploded in the nose compartment of the B-17, severely wounding Sarnoski and knocking him completely out of the compartment. Sarnoski dragged himself back to his station and continued to fire until he died at his position. The B-17 eventually landed successfully in New Guinea after Sarnoski died. Jay Zeamer Jr. was also awarded the Medal of Honor, the only instance of World War II when two members of one crew were honored for separate acts of heroism in the same combat engagement. This mission has been recreated by The History Channel as part of Episode 12 of its series Dogfights, \\"Long Odds\\", first telecast January 19, 2007. ==Burial and remembrances== On January 6, 1949, two days after the first interment at the new cemetery, Sarnoski's body was returned from its burial location on New Guinea and interred in Section A, Grave 582 of the National Cemetery of the Pacific at Honolulu, Hawaii. Merli-Sarnoski State Park, located in Fell Township (just outside of Carbondale), Pennsylvania, was co-named for Joseph Sarnoski and Gino J. Merli in 2002; both were World War II Medal of Honor recipients and Lackawanna County residents. A street on the Basic Military Training side of Lackland AFB, Texas has also been named for 2nd Lt Sarnoski. A military parade field alongside the 43d Airlift Group's headquarters on Pope Field, part of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was named in 2nd Lt Sarnoski's honor in 2008. In 2012 a parking lot was built over a majority of the field. ==Military Decorations== His decorations include: { 150px USAAF Bombardier Badge -  Medal of Honor -  Silver Star -  Purple Heart -  Air Medal -  Army Good Conduct Medal -  American Defense Service Medal -  American Campaign Medal with bronze service star -  Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with silver campaign star -  World War II Victory Medal } { -  Army Presidential Unit Citation with bronze oak leaf cluster } ===Medal of Honor citation=== The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to SARNOSKI, JOSEPH R.

The system measured at the most 26.1 km on four lines. ==History== While Drammen had got the Drammen trolleybus, the first in Scandinavia in 1909, Oslo had relied on the Oslo Tramway since 1875. In 1927 Oslo Sporveier started their first bus route, and on 28 September 1931 they sent an application for operation of a trolleybus in Oslo between Oslo and Grorud. But the application met a lot of resistance. Sch√∏yens Bilcentraler route 30 went from Grorud to Sk√∏yen, and if Oslo Sporveier were to operate a route on the same line they would have to pay compensation to Sch√∏yens. To avoid this, Oslo Sporveier changed their applied terminus to Majorstuen. But while the City Council of Aker wanted the other solution, and was pressing Oslo Sporveier to go to Sk√∏yen, and the Norwegian National Road Administration felt that if Oslo Sporveier wanted to build a trolleybus route to Grorud, they would have to pay for part of the upgrade of Trondheimsveien, a term not acceptable for the company. After a one-year trial run in Drammen in 1939 the first trolleybus route in Oslo opened in 1940. This was line 17, a 1.6 km feeding line at Rodel√∏kka. This line only used one bus, that didn't run on Sundays so it could be maintained. Then came World War II with fuel shortage, resulting in the trolleybus being quite popular, as Norway had ample electricity. But there were other problems, including material shortage and the fear of the German forces confiscating any copper that would be used in the wires. But after the war the network was expanded onwards, with three new lines in 1946. The lines were constantly expanded until 1955 when the network was at its largest.Aspenberg, op. cit., p. 70 The end of the trolleybuses started in 1960 when the sale of cars in Norway was deregulated. This resulted in an enormous reduction in public transport ridership, and the same year the Oslo City Council decided to close both the trolleybus and tramway networks. In 1961 the first line was decommissioned, followed by another the next year. Excess buses were sold to Drammen. The last lines were closed in 1968. The plan was to replace all the electrical powered tram and trolleybus routes with the diesel bus, a strategy that would prove fatal when the oil crisis (1973 and 1979) hit in the 1970s. Unlike the trolleybus network, the Oslo Tramway still exists.Aspenberg, op. cit., p. 78 ==References== Oslo Category:Trolleybus transport in Norway Category:Oslo Sporveier Category:Public transport in Oslo Category:Bus transport in Oslo ","title":"Trolleybuses in Oslo"},{"id":"9097453","text":"Thomas Harris (born 1940) is an American author.

Distances of 30 m (150 feet) or more and over 1,500 mm (60 inches) in diameter are common, although the method can be used for much longer and larger installations. The method is useful for pipe and casing installations under railway lines and roads, where other trenchless methods could cause subsidence or heaving. The majority of installations are horizontal, although the method can be used for vertical installations. The main differences between the Pipe ramming method and Pipe Jacking method are that Pipe ramming uses percussion and does not have a navigation system, while Pipe Jacking uses hydraulic jacks and does have an active navigation system. The Pipe Ramming method is preferable for shorter distances and applications that does not require very tight directional control such as cable installations. The method uses pneumatic percussive blows to drive the pipe through the ground. The leading edge of the pipe is almost always open, and is typically closed only when smaller pipes are being installed. The shape allows a small overcut (to reduce friction between the pipe and soil and improve load conditions on the pipe), and directs the soil into the pipe interior instead of compacting it outside the pipe. These objectives are usually achieved by attaching a soil-cutting shoe or special bands to the pipe. Further reduction of friction is typically achieved with lubrication, and different types of bentonite and/or polymers can be used (as in horizontal directional boring) for this purpose. Spoil removal from the pipe can be done after the entire pipe is in place (shorter installations). If the pipe containing the spoil becomes too heavy before the installation is complete, the ramming can be interrupted and the pipe cleaned (longer installations). Spoil can be removed by auger, compressed air or water jetting. Recent research on instrumented pipe ramming installations has allowed the development of pipe ramming-specific models for static soil resistance and dynamic model parameters for simulating drivability of rammed pipes. These procedures can be used to estimate the feasibility of pipe ramming installations. == Pipe jacking == The pipe jacking method consists on the principle of driving the tunnel from a launch shaft in the direction of a target (or reception) shaft. thumb The alignment is controlled using a laser beam, from the launch shaft, which guides the machine thru the tunnel axis. The laser is the basic control device and it works with inclinometers and gyroscopes. The laser beam is directed to the machine cutter head and its position is controlled in real time by a navigation system at the surface. thumb thumb ==References== ==External links== * OSU Pipe Ramming Research * How Pipe Ramming Works * TTC.latech.edu Category:Trenchless technology Category:Subterranean excavating equipment companies ","title":"Pipe ramming"},{"id":"9097556","text":"The John Deere House and Shop is located in the unincorporated village of Grand Detour, Illinois, near the Lee County city of Dixon. The site is known as the location where the first steel plow was invented by John Deere in 1837. The site includes Deere's house, a replica of his original blacksmith shop, a gift shop, and an archaeological exhibit showing the excavation site of his original blacksmith shop. The Deere House and Shop is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it joined that list in 1966, the year the Register was established. Prior to that, it was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964. ==History== In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set out from Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new business established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow and had to be scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.Leffingwell, Randy. \\"John Deere: A History of the Tractor\\" (Google Books), MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company, 2004, p. 10, (). Retrieved May 21, 2007. There are varying tales as to the inspiration for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876. ==John Deere Historic Site== A modern-day blacksmith tends to the fire in the forge in the replica blacksmith shop. The John Deere Historic Site in Grand Detour, Illinois is operated by the John Deere Company and has five components. Outside of the perimeter, which is surrounded by a white, wooden fence, are of prairie restoration.

The John Deere House was built in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the building was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects that would have been common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four rooms on the main level and two rooms upstairs. Each of the upstairs rooms is accessible via a private staircase and it is believed one of the rooms was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom. The front entry leads into the living room where polished wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used for the rest of the children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois. ==Shop== The preserved archaeological dig site. The original blacksmith shop on the site is long gone, however, in 1962 an archaeological team made of students from the University of Illinois approached the Deere Company about excavating the site where the shop once stood.Farmer, Tina Marie. \\"Tiller of the soil: John Deere still plows the prairie ,\\" www.aiec.coop, September 2004, 13, via Illinois Periodicals Online.

A blacksmith shop does occupy the current John Deere Historic Site grounds. Archaeologists used a magnetometer to locate the position of the forge in the original blacksmith shop, thus, the current shop shares an interior which is an exact replica of the original.

The Landmark designation was assigned by the U.S. Department of Interior because of the House and Shop's association with John Deere, founder of the John Deere Company and inventor of the first steel plow. His invention was of significance to the entire United States and made large scale cultivation of areas in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio possible.

A Hakka, he has acted in many films directed by Lau Kar-leung, including Mad Monkey Kung Fu and Legendary Weapons of China. In 1985 he portrayed legendary kung fu warrior Fong Sai-Yuk in the Lau directed action-comedy, Disciples of the 36th Chamber and also took a lead role in Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing. Fake Ghost Catchers is marketed by Celestial Pictures as being made two years before Ghostbusters (inferring that the idea for Ghostbusters may have come from the movie). Hou is also known for portraying the \\"disfigured swordsman\\" and doubling complicated action scenes in 1993's Iron Monkey. He was also the action director for the movie Shaolin Avengers (1994). In 1982 he was nominated for Best Action Choreography for the movie Legendary Weapons of China (for which he was action director) at the Hong Kong Film Awards alongside Lau Kar Leung and Ching Chu who also provided choreography for the film. Born Hao Yiu Chung, he was trained in Beijing opera by Fan Kuk-Fa as a child and acted in films. He moved to the United States in the 1960s with classmates where he learned acrobatics from different instructors under the watchful tutelage of Fan Kuk- Fa. He later returned to China, and at age 17 became a martial arts stunt performer, which led to his starring role in Mad Monkey Kung Fu in 1979. He then became a contracted actor with Shaw Brothers StudioBiography at Hong Kong Movie Database (retrieved on 25 January 2007) and studied Hung Gar, a specialised Kung Fu under Lau Kar Leung. A very young man at the time, he was always cast by director Lau Kar Leung as the rebellious teen. In the cult classic My Young Auntie Hou played the energetic rebellious teenage son of Lau Kar Leung. In Disciples of the 36th Chamber he also played the rebellious son. Because of an ability to perform difficult stunts and acrobats with ease, Hsiao Hou was often cast in roles that required an expert stunt performer and martial artist. While his career did not reach the popularity of frequent co- stars Gordon Liu or Kara Hui, he is considered a Shaw Brothers legend by legions of fans and is highly regarded for martial arts, comedic talents, and acrobatic talent. Lau Kar Leung was once quoted as calling Hou the most \\"talented action actor (or star)\\" in his class. Hsiao Hou's last known interview was in 2004 taken by Video Asia. Though he was not featured on the cover in western versions of the popular Shaw Brother releases, Hsiao Hou took the starring roles in Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Legendary Weapons of China, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, Fake Ghost Catchers and My Young Auntie. He later acted in small supporting roles in films by Sammo Hung. He has also been a martial arts and action director/choreographer. ==Filmography Films === This is a partial list of films. *Dirty Ho (1976) - Hsia Liu *Shaolin Mantis (1977) - Governor's Henchman (uncredited) *The Iron Fisted Monk (1977) - Bearded monk *Mian meng xin jing (1977) *He Has Nothing But Kung Fu (1977) *The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978) - Shaolin disciple *Gui ma kuang chao (1978) *Tang lang (1978) *Heroes of the East (1978) *Dirty Tiger, Crazy Frog (1978) *Spiritual Boxer 2 (1979) - Chou's man *Mad Monkey Kung Fu (1979) - Monkey *Way of the Black Dragon (1979) *Kung Fu Genius (1979) *Clan of the White Lotus (1980) - Personal Swordsman of White Lotus *Nan bei tui wang (1980) *Return to the 36th Chamber (1980) - Ho Chiao *Martial Club (1981) - Mai Chen-Huo *My Young Auntie (1981) - Charlie Yu Tao *Legendary Weapons of China (1982) - Tieh A-hou *The Fake Ghost Catchers (1982) *The Treasure Hunters (1982) *Cat Versus Rat (1982) - Chiang Ping *Aces Go Places 2 (1983) - Gangster in Club *The Lady is the Boss (1983) *Eight-Diagram Pole Fighter (1984) - Yang Sze-lang *Crazy Shaolin Disciples (1985) *Disciples of the 36th Chamber (1985) - Fang Shih Yu *Heart of Dragon (1985) *Yes Madam!

After Ned Spoon split in the early '70s, he and his brother, Willie, formed Highway, an acoustic hippy duo. With the arrival of the 1980s, the brothers formed the short-lived new wave/synthpop band Minor Detail. It became the first Irish band to secure a recording contract with an American label, but released only one album.John Hughes Bio at IMDB. Retrieved September 07, 2007. Their album was produced by Bill Whelan (of Riverdance fame). ===Discovering the Corrs=== In 1991, Hughes started a band called Hughes Version, featuring Jim Corr on keyboards. Hughes was also working as musical coordinator for the movie The Commitments. Jim Corr simultaneously decided to audition with his three sisters, unbeknownst to Hughes at the time. Commitments casting director Ros Hubbard who had heard them perform, convinced Hughes to become the band's manager despite his total lack of prior experience. Hughes remains The Corrs' manager to this day. === Wild Ocean === Hughes put his own music aside when taking over the Corrs but in 1999 went back into the studio to write and record new material. The result was Wild Ocean, released in 2004 by 14th Floor Records/Warner Records. The album's name was supposedly suggested by Andrea Corr. Wild Ocean also features the musical talent of The Corrs, The Chieftains, and newcomer Tara Blaise who co-wrote and is a featured vocalist on several tracks. Encouraged by her work, Hughes signed Blaise to his own label Spokes Records afterwards, and co-wrote material with her for her debut album Dancing on Tables Barefoot. === The Mandela Suite === In 2009, Hughes worked on an EP called The Mandela Suite.

After this window, if one fencer had already landed a hit, the electrical scoring apparatus would \\"lock-out,\\" or fail to record, an opponent's subsequent hit, and thus the one fencer to land a hit is awarded the touch. In √©p√©e fencing, if both fencers land valid hits at the same time, they each receive a point. Because of this foil and sabre are considered conventional weapons. After a halt, a referee parses what happened into actions, from which it can be determined whether to award a point or not. == Offensive Actions == Offensive actionsFIE Technical Rules t.9 * Attack - An attempt to hit when the opponent is not already attacking. * Riposte - An attempt to hit the opponent after a successful parry ** Counter-Riposte - An attempt to hit the opponent after a riposte was successfully parried Counter-attacksFIE Technical Rules t.12 * Counter Attack - An attempt to hit when the opponent is already attacking.

Much of this acrimony is centered on the definition of attack. According to the FIE rules, an attack is defined as \\"the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent's target...\\". This is explained in the USFA Fencing Officials Commission FAQ: Initial refers to which fencer starts the action before his/her opponent does. Offensive indicates moving towards the opponent. Extending indicates that the weapon arm is moving away from the body - right of way does not require a fully extended arm. Continuously indicates that there is no \\"break\\" in the attack in which the attacker stops moving forward or holds back his/her arm. Threatening indicates that the attacker is in advance-lunge distance and close enough to hit, and his/her weapon's point (for foil) or blade (for sabre) are approaching the opponent's valid target. The general consensus is that a useful guide is for the referee to look for which fencer's arm starts straightening first. In practice, referees, especially inexperienced ones, may go for the easy option and give priority to whichever fencer happened to be moving forwards. This is technically wrong, but it is far from unusual. There is also a school of thought, subscribed to by a relatively small minority, that priority should be given to the fencer who was the first to straighten his/her arm fully. This, again, is out of line with the current rules. The adherents argue that this is the more classical way of doing things, but this claim is dubious, as actual practice decades ago based right of way on which fencer started straightening the arm (not which fencer completed the extension); and the reworded rules conform better to actual, traditional practice which was documented in some older editions of the rules. For example, the 1957 Amateur Fencers League of America (AFLA) rules says > The rules do not require that the attack be made with a fully extended arm; > in fact, there are outstanding international champions in foil and sabre who > attack without extending the arm fully. However, in all cases, the attacker > must clearly take the initiative in combat by threatening the defender's > target with a forward movement of the weapon, whether by extension of the > arm or a movement of the body or a combination of both. The classical > schools of fencing recommend the extension of the arm on the attack because > this method simplifies the task of the President of the Jury in many > situations, as for example in the case of attacks which deceive the parry > (see ¬ß 11 below). https://quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1957.pdf AFLA Rules 1957 CHAPTER IV b) 3) An attack which has failed (i.e. has missed or been parried) is no longer an attack. Priority does not automatically pass to the defending fencer, and at the moment an attack is over, neither fencer has priority. Instead, priority is gained by a fencer making an offensive action, as is always the case. If the attack was parried, the defender has the right to make a riposte, but it must be initiated without indecision or delay. Alternatively, (s)he may initiate his/her own attack if the initial attack missed. The fencer making the original attack may also make a new offensive action, a renewal of the initial attack. If the attacker immediately continues his/her attack in the same line, it is called a remise. A parry is a defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action from landing. In practice, even a light blade contact is often sufficient to prevent an attack from landing, so long as it is not a \\"mere grazing of the blades\\" (as expressed in the rules). Therefore, it is not necessary for a parry to \\"close the line\\" (an \\"opposition parry\\"), though that may be used for tactical purposes. Consequently, foilists often parry with a sharp beating motion which does not necessarily end in a guard position that closes a line. In sabre, according to the FIE rules, \\"the parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish\\". In practice, sabre referees tend to look at the point of blade contact: contact of a defender's forte with an attacker's foible is generally counted as a parry, whereas contact of a defender's foible with an attacker's forte is incorrectly executed, and priority stays with the attacker. Some fencers refer to a retreat that makes an attack fall short as a \\"distance parry\\", but this is informal use: an actual parry requires blade contact. ==References== Category:Fencing ","title":"Priority (fencing)"},{"id":"9097690","text":"Francesco Bordoni (1580‚Äì1654), also known as Francisque Bourdon, was an Italian sculptor who was active mainly in France.

He is the vice-chairperson and the commander-in-chief of the United Liberation Front of Assam ‚Äì Independent (ULFA ‚Äì I). Baruah lives in Yunnan, China where he receives funding and patronage from Chinese intelligence agencies. He insists that the Han Chinese are friends of the Assamese and want to help them become independent, even though his influence has largely diminished. He is currently residing in his Chinese safe haven near Myanmar-China Border. == Early life and family == Paresh Baruah was born in 1956 at Birpara (campo), Assam, India to a Motok family. In December 2010, Paresh e-mailed the Indo-Asian News Service reporting that his elder son (19) has been abducted in Bangladesh \\"to exert mental pressure on his family and to force him to surrender.\\" Later, the ULFA said that his son was beaten sorely by the kidnappers \\"to pressure him to disclose his father's whereabouts, sources of income and business\\", but was allowed to leave after painstaking interrogation. The organisation further claimed that Baruah's son was terrified to stay tight-lipped about his kidnapping. In his e-mail, Baruah also wrote: He described the incident as a stratagem of Indian officials but they denied the accusation. Times of Assam has claimed that the Indian intelligent agencies may be trying to ferret out Baruah by closely monitoring Sunlee. The newspaper further claimed that numerous pictures of Sunlee were gathered by the intelligence agencies in early 2012. The Union Home Secretary of India has said that Baruah's family is not desirous to return to India, because of their stiff attitude. A collaborator of Baruah has said that two aides of Arabinda Rajkhowa were sent to Bangladesh to convince his and Anup Chetia's family to come back to India. == Demand for Aai Asom and role as ULFA leader == In 2004, Baruah was constantly in touch with some academics including Indira Goswami and numerous organisations, but he was switched to a secure location to undergo a surgery due to a medical emergency, which temporarily halted the communication. Around 2008, he was again in frequent e-mail communication with the Assamese author, Indira Goswami. She acted as a mediator in proposed peace talks between ULFA leaders and the government of India. He was alleged to have insisted on the Independence of Assam, and the peace talks did not take place. In January 2010, G. K. Pillai had substantial talks with his official Myanmar counterpart at Nay Pyi Taw on numerous issues, but Baruah was one of the main focal points. Later, an official from the Ministry of Home Affairs conveyed to the press that Myanmar has promised to capture Baruah, if he is discovered in the country. Later in August, the Indian agencies claimed that within January, Baruah was legally provided the Chinese visa which authorised him to stay in China for a maximum time period of six months. The agencies further claimed that the Chinese visa was given to him on a Bangladeshi passport which was further reported to had been issued under his alias Kamrul Zaman. But, the Chinese Foreign Ministry had repudiated the allegations, claiming that it had never rendered assistance to the ULFA's commander-in-chief. A photograph of Kalita and the ULFA cadres holding arms and dressed in combat fatigues was strategically provided to the press by the organisation in 2011. The organisation also distributed a video of Baruah to the media groups in which he was dancing with the cadres of ULFA, during the Bihu festival. The video was seen as an attempt to intimidate the government of India and the ULFA members who agreed to lay down arms. In the video, the ULFA cadres can be heard shouting slogans in favour of the secession of Assam. Earlier, the Indian government had granted bails to some of the high ranking arrested leaders of the ULFA \\"to try and isolate Baruah and hold formal peace talks\\". In September 2011, the Myanmar Army was able to trace Manjit along with some ULFA members in the forest regions of north-west Myanmar and struck at them. But, despite of sustaining injuries, he survived the onslaught. The same year, the then Home Secretary of India told media that the government of Myanmar has taken a journalist into custody, who was believed to have gone there to interview Baruah. A senior ULFA leader, Jivan Moran, was also arrested along with the reporter. This followed a hoax in media that Baruah had also been captured, but the Home Secretary denied receiving any such information. Manjit was extensively reported to have shifted to China, but in 2012, he was sighted in Nagaland, goalkeeping in a football match between the team of the United Liberation Front of Assam, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) versus the People's Liberation Army of Manipur. The football match was organised as an attempt to promote cooperation between the insurgent organisations operating in India's North-East. Baruah has ruled out negotiations with the government of India without addressing the question of Independence for Assam, and described the \\"peace talks\\" between the \\"pro-talk faction\\" with the Indian government as \\"a sell-out by Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and other leaders.\\" But, he added that the ULFA's \\"demand for Independence does not mean secession\\". He further declared that the \\"anti-talk faction\\" of ULFA will not halt their battle for the \\"Aai Asom (motherland)\\", and he had issued the \\"pro- talk faction\\" a deadline of three months to \\"break talks with the government and return to the outfit.\\" After the ultimatum of three months was over without any response from Rajkhowa, the ULFA ousted him from his appointed ranks in the ULFA on 8 August 2012, and announced that Abhizeet Asom, who was working as the acting chairman, would serve the organisation as its chairperson since the day. Later on 30 April 2013, the wing led by Baruah, which adhere uncompromisingly to the demand of the Independence of Assam renamed the organisation as the ULFA ‚Äì Independent. They believe the organisation's new name is \\"in tune with its uncompromising quest for liberation of Assam\\" from what they view as the \\"colonial Indian rule\\". Baruah said that he does recognises Rajkhowa's work but Asom is a more politically conscious individual. In March 2013, he castigated Rajkhowa's pronouncement to the journalists that Baruah is still the whole ULFA's commander-in-chief and will also join the ongoing talks,\\" affirming that \\"he [Baruah] would never come forward for talks with the government under the framework of Constitution as it would not be able to solve the conflict as the solution lay only in restoration of Independence of Assam.\\" He further accused the pro-talk faction of forgetting the 14,000 ULFA cadres who drew their last breath while battling with who he termed as the \\"Indian occupational forces.\\" Bhimkanta Buragohain alias Mama, who was one of the senior-most leaders of ULFA, and had held a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2011 to achieve an understanding between the pro-talk faction of ULFA and the Indian government, once said: Manjit expressed sorrow on Buragohain's demise on 19 December 2011, and issued a joint official statement with Bormon stating that the ULFA's members are grieving over his death. He described the passing away of Buragohain as a \\"huge loss\\" to the organisation. They further declared a three days mourning, and announced to keep the ULFA's flags lowered in its camps. One of his collaborator had alleged that G. K. Pillai had attempted to spread rumor regarding Baruah, to fabricate misconception about him amongst the people of Assam. On 30 January 2014, a special court in Chittagong commuted death sentence to Baruah and 13 others for smuggling in 10 truckloads of firearms in 2004. However, Baruah is unlikely to get intimidated by the Bangladeshi court's verdict, and is expected to continue with his activities. == Views on the Maoist movement in India == He has an empathy with the Naxalites, and recently said in interview that the ULFA and the Communist Party of India (Maoist) have a \\"tactical understanding\\". In an e-mail sent to the media, he further quoted: Kishenji also acknowledged that the ULFA's \\"way\\" is dissimilar from the Maoists'. The \\"experts\\" hold the view the link between the Maoists and the ULFA \\"would remain on a purely strategic level\\" only. == Controversies == In April 2013, the news media alleged that on 10 April, Baruah had aggressively warned the artists to refrain from signing and performing on Hindi songs during the Rongali Bihu celebrations, and threatened to kill Zubeen Garg for not following their words. Tarun Gogoi also appreciated Garg for not listening to the ULFA. But, while being interviewed by an Assamese television channel, Baruah elucidated that the ULFA made \\"only an appeal to all artistes not to sing Hindi songs at Bihu functions\\" and that their \\"appeal\\" was misapprehend as a warning. He also stated that Garg must express regret for his comments over the organisation's appeal. == See also == * Enigma Force * List of top leaders of ULFA * People's Consultative Group * Sanjukta Mukti Fouj == References == * \\"Come polls and all parties woo ULFA\\", New Wind Press, 14 January 2007 * \\"Paresh Baruah's close aide Pranjit Saikia was another key of Indian Intelligence\\", Times of Assam, 30 May 2012 == External links == * One of India's most-wanted dances in video, NDTV * Paresh Barua's interview with Rediff, October 1997.

CMC has been broadcasting the hottest music videos over the air in the Bay Area since 1982. Over the past 38 years, CMC has grown from an hour-long program to two 24/7 stations with digital simulcast capabilities. CMC has constantly been adapting with the technologies of the world to figure out new ways to enrich the lives of their loyal audience. The live broadcasts feature on-camera disc jockeys, audience participation, and contemporary music videos. It is owned by CMC Broadcasting Company, Inc. CMC is carried as a Digital Broadcast Network on thirteen Northern California television stations originating from KKPM. == History 1981-1982=== CMC was founded on August 31, 1981, by Rick Kurkjian, debuting on March 1, 1982, as a half-hour show telecast twelve times per week on Teleprompter Cable Oakland Channel 12. The notion of a Bay Area Interconnect was developed early on as CMC expanded by doing local original cable channels on Concord TV Cable Ch. 11, Viacom Cable of San Francisco Ch 6, Viacom of Marin and Castro Valley Cable TV. After a little more than a year on the local cable channels CMC started running a Saturday night version of the program on KCSM-TV Ch 60 in San Mateo. The CMC broadcast was simulcast in stereo on KCSM-TV's sister station, KCSM-FM 91.1. ===1983=== In 1983, KCSM-TV was one of a handful of educational-access television stations to experiment with running expanded underwriting announcements and full 30-second commercial TV spots from non-profit organizations. In addition to the U.S. Army, many of its other advertisers were coincidentally set up as non-profit organizations under dealer associations and franchise organizations such as the California Milk Advisory Board and the McDonald's \\"Golden Arches Advertising Fund\\". As such, CMC was able to include commercials for these organizations on the otherwise non-commercial, educational, KCSM.

Born at Montevarchi, the son of a Tuscan cavalry captain, Soldani was employed by the Medici for his entire career.Klaus Lankheit, Florentinische Barockplastik, 1962. ==Name== He first went under the name Soldani but, claiming descent from the family of bishop Soldani of Fiesole and from the aristocratic Benzi family of Figline, he applied for and received, in 1693, an official letterDocument 330, in Lankheit 1962. acknowledging his nobility based on this ancestry. From this date forward, he called himself, and is referred to in many documents as, Soldani Benzi. ==Life== Soldani began training in the Medici drawing school in Florence. He attracted the attention of Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici who sent Soldani to his grand-ducal academy in Rome to study under Ciro Ferri and Ercole Ferrata, and to train in coining. During his years in Rome (1678-81), he showed much promise and was asked by Queen Christina of Sweden to create several medals. He started this enterprise but left it unfinished as Cosimo transferred the artist to Paris to work with the famous medallist Joseph Roettiers. While there in 1682, Soldani came into contact with Charles Le Brun and minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Learning that the artist was working on a medal portrait of Louis XIV, a courtier Soldani refers to the courtier as \\"Mons.r Duca d'Homone\\" Lankheit 1962, doc. 306. (possibly Louis, duc d'Aumont who was very interested in the art of medals) introduced the young man to the king. The model for this medal of Louis XIV is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.Model for a Medal: Portrait of King Louis XIV, and Hercules Victorious over the Lernaean Hydra. Grand Duke Cosimo in the meantime decided that it was time for Soldani to return to Florence and take charge of the Grand-ducal Mint, the job he was meant to occupy from the very start. Upon the death of the current director, Soldani was officially made Maestro dei Coni e Custode della Zecca in 1688. As such he had his workshop and living quarters in the Uffizi.

It was a successful expedition, as all goals were reached. In addition, neither lives nor ships were lost and the whole was done in a small amount of time. Southeastern Tierra del Fuego, including Strait of Le Maire, Cape Horn and Diego Ramirez Islands. The easternmost tip of Tierra del Fuego main island (Isla Grande de Tierra de Fuego) is the Cape San Diego, so named by the Garcia de Nodal brothers Map of Diego Ramirez Islands ==Background== The Garc√≠a de Nodal expedition was crucial to the Spanish Empire. The discovery of a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, an alternative to the Strait of Magellan, dramatically changed the Spanish approach to the management of the southernmost regions of America, which were already disturbed by Drake‚Äôs unexpected emergence in the Pacific through the Strait in 1578. The expedition was led by the Portuguese brothers Bartolomeu and Gon√ßalo Nodal, with the cosmographer Diego Ram√≠rez de Arellano Cham√°s serving as pilot (chief navigator). Two vessels of similar construction were used in the expedition to prevent one ship of having to wait for the other when sailing, a common hindrance in others expeditions of the time. The expedition sailed from Lisbon, Portugal (which was by then united to Spain in the crown of Philip II) on September 27, 1618 and on January 1619, they entered the strait between Tierra del Fuego and Isla de los Estados which they called Estrecho de San Vicente (now known as Strait of Le Maire). The following weeks were spent meticulously exploring and naming the southern shores of Tierra del Fuego and its southern islands including Cape Horn, which they named Cabo San Ildefonso. Next the expedition sailed south to 58¬∫30'S, discovering the Diego Ramirez Islands and going farther south into the Drake Passage. They then turned north into the Pacific Ocean and skillfully entered the Strait of Magellan, on February 25, from the west in their first attempt. They passed into the Atlantic on March 13, and they returned to Spain on July 7, 1619. ==Results and evaluation== As a result of their expedition they provided the Spanish Casa de Contrataci√≥n with invaluable data and maps that were kept secret for centuries. > In the annals of Cape Horn exploration, this must rank as one of the most > professional expeditions, particularly when seen against the standards of > the age in which it took place, and it would be nice to report the two > brothers had many years to enjoy their justly deserved fame.

The sornƒÅ or SarnƒÅ ( sornƒÅ, also sornƒÅy, also Surna and Zurna) is an ancient Iranian woodwind instrument. ==Etymology== The word sorna is a Pahlavi derivative of s≈´rnƒÅy (literally \\"strong flute\\"), which is a compand of 's≈´r-' (strong) and '-nƒÅy' (flute).MacKenzie, D. N., A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary, London (1971), p. 78 . Possibly it was called \\"strong flute\\" due to its double-reed-construction rather than usual nƒÅy, which was made of a single tube of cane. Also it is suggested that the first part of word of sorna, is from s≈´r- again from Pahlavi and New-Persian, meaning the \\"banquet, meal and feast\\", thus the \\"banquet-flute\\". It is also suggested that \\"Sorna\\" is a cognate of \\"Horn\\", as \\"Sorna\\" simply means horn. This is a result of the Centum-Satem isogloss, and later Grimm's Law. Even in Persian there is another wind instrument whose name appears to be a cognate of both \\"Sorna\\" and \\"Horn\\", called \\"Karna\\" (); this may stem from a re-borrowing from another language. ==History== The instrument's history dates back to the Achaemenid Dynasty (550‚Äì330 BCE), and was used to play at the end of the day from the city gate or from the local administration building. This custom persisted in England until the 19th century, the town waits playing shawms to mark the hours. The instrument was mainly played in outdoors in regional music of Iran in the festive ceremonies (the Persian poet Molana Rumi mentioned the sorna and dohol in his poems). The Achaemenid sorna was a large trumpet-like instrument, but in later dates was reduced in size, and became more like (shrill oboe), or dozale (double oboe), which is characterized by a turned wood body of simple shape, with a heavily flared bell. The earlier was categorized as a trumpet, but this was a mistaken idea based on the bell of the oboe and the freeblowing embouchure that often gives a superficial resemblance to a brass embouchure, particularly if the oboe is fitted as so many are with a lip ring.Pope, U., \\"An Outline History of Persian Music and Musical Theory\\", in Survey of Persian Art, Vol. VI, pp. 2783‚Äì2804. According to the Shahnameh, it was King Jamshid who devised the SornƒÅ.Pope, U., \\"An Outline History of Persian Music and Musical Theory\\", in Survey of Persian Art, Vol. VI, p. 2784. Except the literary evidences, there are also number of artefacts from Sasanian dynasty (224‚Äì651 CE), depicting Sorna, such a silver dish, currently in Hermitage Museum.Farmer, H. G., Studies in Oriental Musical Instruments, 2nd ser., London (1926), pp. 69‚Äì86. ==Function== A small amount of air is forced under pressure through a small metal tube called the staple which serves to hold the reed and match it to the bore. This requires the player to make sure, as in oboe playing, that one also empties the lungs of stale air when taking a new breath. Often sornas were played in pairs, with a melody and a drone player. This drone may move to different notes during a piece of music, changing at prescribed places in the composition. Several other names, such as dohol, davul, tavel, and so on have been applied to the sorna. Since dohol is a double-faced drum sometimes it is called do-r≈´yeh in Persian language, in contrast to ghaval and daf, which are yek-r≈´yeh (one-faced). ==Popularity== The Sorna is mostly played in Loristan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kurdistan, Sistan and Baluchestan Province and Iranian Azerbaijan. In Loristan, Sorna is used as a main instrument during wedding ceremonies and also funeral ceremonies (which is called Chamaryounah). Sorna almost always is accompanied with dohol in this region. In the region of Sistan and Baluchestan, sorna is mostly used in wedding ceremonies and other celebration. The instrument is always accompanied by dohol and sometimes may include traditional dance by forming a circle. ==See also== *Shahmirza Moradi *Suona *Zurna ==References== Category:Iranian musical instruments Category:Iranian inventions Category:Oboes ","title":"Sorna"},{"id":"9097815","text":":For the village of the same name located on the northern side of Lake Sevan, see Martuni (village).

As of the 2011 census, the town had a population of 12,894. As per the 2016 official estimate the population of Martuni is around 11,200. ==Etymology== During the medieval period, the area of present-day Martuni was known as Mets Kznut. Between 1830 and 1922 it was called Nerkin Gharanlugh. In 1926, it was named Martuni in honor of the bolshevik leader and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of Armenia Aleksandr Myasnikyan, whose nom-de-guerre was Martuni. ==History== ==Geography== ==Demographics== ==Culture== Martuni is home to the Holy Mother of God Church dating back to 1886. There is also an Iron Age fort excavated in 1997 by an Armenian-Italian team. Armenian refugees from Alashkert who moved to Martuni brought over their tradition of hemp seed kufteh.https://hetq.am/eng/news/84620/hemp-kufteh-only-the-flavor-is- addictive-in-this-traditional-alashkert-lenten-dish.html The kufteh is most frequently consumed during lent. Since cannabis and hemp are derived from the same plant, there have been times when the Martuni police have cracked down on local hemp bushes cultivation, incorrectly assuming the plants were involved with narcotic production. ==Economy== Martuni is home to the \\"Arev-1\\" bread factory founded in 1995, and the \\"Golden Lens\\" coffee processing plant founded in 1998. Starting 2015, 10 organizations came together to develop a revival program in a village on the 100-year commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. There were economic, health, child development programs, initiated by The Armenian Missionary Association of America (the AMAA), supported by World Vision Armenia, COAF, SHEN and other organizations. ==Education== ==Sport== The town was the original home of Armenian Premier League team FC Alashkert. The club was named for the Western Armenian town of Alashkert (modern day Ele≈ükirt) from where a large number of refugees came to Martuni after the Armenian Genocide. The club was founded in 1990 and represented Martuni in the 1992 Armenian Premier League, the first season of football in Armenia after the country's independence. They finished bottom of the Second stage, Relegation Group group and were relegated to the Armenian First League. After that first season in the top flight the club pulled out of tournament football. The club returned to play in the 1998 edition of the First League where it finished sixth. Yet after that season it pulled out again. Martuni hasn't had a team since. In 2011 local businessman Bagrat Novojan revived the name of FC Alashkert. Although the club represented both Martuni and the marz of Gegharkunik in the 2012‚Äì13 Armenian First League, in reality the club played elsewhere.

By 1999, he was Professor Emeritus, Harvard University, and Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University. He served on advisory committees for the governments of Canada and the United States and for the World Health Organization. ===Stirling County Study=== In 1948, he initiated and carried out, later joined by his wife, Dr. Jane Murphy (1929- ) the influential Stirling County Study (a longitudinal study still in effect today), which studies the distribution of clinical depression and anxiety disorders in a Canadian study population, with comparative studies in several other communities in New York, Alaska, Nigeria, and Vietnam. His wife took over the direction of the Stirling County Study in 1975. The study is notable, among other things, for demonstrating that \\"the prevalence of depression has remained about 5% throughout the years and that this rate is typical of most populations in North America.\\"Jane Murphy Leighton, Ph.D.Eileen McInnis, Stirling County Study, CBC Atlantic Voice, May 22, 2015 ==Recognition== In 2003 a day-long conference, the Leighton Symposium, was held by the Canadian Anthropology Society in honor of Leighton and Jane Murphy's scientific contributions to the field of psychiatric epidemiology.Marc-Ad√©lard Tremblay, \\"Alexander H.

Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider. Yotsui directed both titles. In contrast to Striders futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian setting, while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin who fights without any weapons. 1UP.com included the game in its \\"Games to Play Before You Die\\" list. The game's bizarre plot supposedly mocks director Kouichi Yotsui's experience at Capcom after Strider. ==Gameplay== Gameplay screenshot showcasing Gamran, the first boss of the game. The controls of Osman consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character, and three action buttons for attacking, jumping, and activating a special attack which will destroy all on-screen enemies (which has only a limited number of uses and cannot be fully replenished until the player loses a life). The player can also climb walls and ceilings as well. The player character attacks primarily with his powerful kicks, which can fatally slice through most of the enemy soldiers in the face. Pressing down and jump will cause to slide. While sliding, the player character can do a slide kick with the attack button or grab certain enemies and flip them over with the jump button. The player can also dash by holding the joystick left or right after sliding. There are four types of power-up capsules that the player can retrieve by destroying certain floating containers. The red capsules will increase the player character's attack power by allowing him to create body images of himself that will mimic his movement. The main character's attack power can be determined by the color of his pants. In his starting level, the character's pants will be blue, which changed to purple with the first power-up (allowing him to create one body image), followed by red (two body images) and white (four body images). The strongest attack level is black, which increases the player character's attack range. If the player takes damage from an enemy Osman's attack power will be reduced by one level. Other power-up items include a green power-up that restores one health point, a yellow power-up that increases the maximum health by one point, and a blue power-up that restores the player's complete health. ==Story== It is the late 21st century, and the world has come under the control of a single federal government. One day a new threat known as Abdullah the Slaver appears, causing widespread terror and panic. The fear in men's hearts incites the abandonment of all economic activity. The federal government, which is the foundation of capitalism and modern civilization, has become nothing less than an insidious idea that corrupts the foundations of society itself.

The system was opened on 26 October 1947 and closed on 11 January 1963. It was operated by Stavanger Buss-Selskap. ==History== The first plans for public transport in Stavanger was launched in 1916 with plans for a tramway. Permission was given, and track and wires were bought, but in the end there wasn't enough money to build the system. In 1933 a plan for trolleybuses was made for Stavanger, in combination with diesel buses. But things came in the way, and it was not until after the end of World War II that the system was constructed. In 1947 the first line, Line 1, was opened from the city square to Hillev√•g, a 3 km stretch. The line was equipped with wires in both directions, but a 2 km line to the depot was only equipped with one wire. On 26 June 1949 the system was supplemented with Line 2 that went between the city square and V√•land, as a partial circle line. During the 1950s there were serious plans for a Line 3 to Tasta. Line 1 operated at a 10-minute headway while Line 2 had a 20-minute headway. The system was closed in the 1960s due to a new route policy of driving the buses through the city, a system that did not work well with the existing trolleybuses. Line 2 was closed in 1962 and on 11 January 1963 the last trolleybus was driven in Stavanger. The route change was originally to take place on 17 February but a national strike that lasted until 9 February resulted in trolley buses being taken out of service early. None of the five trolleybuses from Stavanger have been preserved. It was announced in 2016 that a new trolleybus system will open in the city in 2021.http://www.trolleymotion.eu/www/index.php?id=38&L;=3/&n;_ID=2378 ==References== Stavanger Category:Trolleybus transport in Norway Category:Bus transport in Rogaland ","title":"Trolleybuses in Stavanger"},{"id":"9097945","text":"Michael R.

Funerary monument, Kensal Green Cemetery, London Wilson was born in Ballycloughan, County Antrim, Ireland, in 1832. He was educated at Ballymena and at first intended taking up civil engineering. For three years he worked for a brother- in-law [Robert Chesney], a linen manufacturer, but in 1852 decided to emigrate to Australia. He arrived in Melbourne in May 1852 and worked on the goldfields, but a few months later decided to join two brothers who had preceded him to Australia, and had a pastoral property in the Wimmera. He was made manager of one of their holdings, and selling a small property he had in Ireland, with his brothers bought Longerenong station for ¬£40,000. He dug waterholes and made dams on the property which much improved and increased its carrying capacity. Yanko station in the Riverina was then purchased and much improved. In 1869 Wilson bought his brothers' interests in their stations, afterwards bought other stations in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and became very wealthy. He was interested in the Acclimatization Society of Victoria and in 1873 wrote pamphlets on the angora goat, and on the ostrich. In 1878 a paper he had written was expanded into a volume, The Californian Salmon With an Account of its Introduction into Victoria, and published in the same year. In 1879 another edition of this was published in London under the title, Salmon at the Antipodes. In 1874 Wilson gave the University of Melbourne ¬£30,000 which with accrued interest was expended on a building in the Gothic style now known as the Wilson Hall. It was the most considerable gift or bequest that the university had received up to then. In the following year he was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council (1875-1881) and Legislative Assembly (1861-64) for the Western Province, but he never took a very prominent part in politics. Around that time he purchased the magnificent Ercildoune property for a rumoured ¬£250,000. About the beginning of 1881 he went to England with his family and leased Hughenden Manor, once the property of the Earl of Beaconsfield. He twice contested seats for the House of Commons without success, but in 1886 was elected as a Conservative for Portsmouth and sat until 1892. In September 1893 he again came to Victoria and stayed until March 1895. He became ill soon after his return to England and died on 11 June 1895, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He was knighted in 1875. He married in 1861 a daughter of the Hon. W. Campbell who survived him with four sons and five daughters. His eldest son, Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Chesney Wilson, married Lady Sarah Isabella Churchill, sister of Lord Randolph Churchill. His daughter Maud Margaret Wilson married Warner Hastings, 15th Earl of Huntingdon. ==References== * *L. J.

During his reign, the state was in effective control of the regents Xu Wen and Xu Wen's adoptive son and successor Xu Zhigao. In 938, Xu Zhigao forced Yang Pu to yield the throne to him, who then established Southern Tang. == Background == Yang Pu was born in 900, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, as the fourth son of the major late-Tang warlord Yang Xingmi the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), whose domain would become Wu eventually. His mother was Yang Xingmi's concubine Lady Wang.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 4. In 919, during the reign of his older brother Yang Longyan (King Xuan, Yang Xingmi's second son, who in turn succeeded another older brother, Yang Wo (Prince Wei of Hongnong)), Yang Pu was created the Duke of Danyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 920, Yang Longyan fell ill, and the regent Xu Wen, who was effectively the ruler of the Wu government, arrived at the capital Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, i.e., modern Yangzhou) to discuss with the officials there (including his adoptive son, the junior regent Xu Zhigao) how to deal with the situation. Some of Xu Wen's followers encouraged that he take the throne himself. Xu, however, disavowing any such intent, proclaimed that he would surely find another son of the Yangs to succeed Yang Longyan. However, as he had long been apprehensive about Yang Xingmi's third son Yang Meng the Duke of Lujiang, who had long lamented Xu Wen's hold on the Wu governance, he did not wish to have Yang Meng succeed Yang Longyan. Instead, he issued an order in Yang Longyan's name, summoning Yang Pu to Jiangdu to serve as regent and moving Yang Meng to serve as the military prefect of Shu Prefecture (ËàíÂ∑û, in modern Huangshan, Anhui). Yang Longyan died shortly after, and Yang Pu took the throne as King of Wu. He honored his mother Lady Wang as queen dowager. == As King of Wu == In 921, Yang Pu, at Xu Wen's urging, formally sacrificed to heaven and earth, signifying his claim to the Mandate of Heaven. (Other officials tried to dissuade Xu, pointing out the high expenses of sacrificing to heaven and earth during Tang Dynasty, but Xu pointed out that Tang's ceremonies were overly wasteful and that proper ceremonies could be carried out without incurring the same high expenses that Tang expended.) In 923, Wu's nominal ally Later Tang's emperor Emperor Zhuangzong (Li Cunxu), in his campaign against their joint enemy Later Liang, had just captured the strategically important city of Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong), and he personally wrote Yang Pu, asking for the two states to jointly attack Later Liang. However, by this point, Wu was beginning to see Later Tang as a threat as well, and Xu considered sending a fleet north, and using it to aid whichever side prevailed. The official Yan Keqiu pointed out that he would have no good excuse not to commit to a position if Later Liang then requested aid as well, and so Xu did not launch the fleet.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Later in the year, Emperor Zhuangzong, in a surprise attack, captured the Later Liang capital Daliang. Later Liang's emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide before the city fell, ending Later Liang, and Later Tang took over Later Liang's territory. Xu, in fear of what the Later Tang emperor might do next, blamed Yan for dissuading him from sending the fleet, but Yan pointed out that Emperor Zhuangzong had become arrogant in his victory and was not ruling his state well, predicting that within a few years his state would be in turmoil. Meanwhile, Later Tang's emissary to Wu initially delivered an edict from Emperor Zhuangzong, but Wu, not viewing itself as a Later Tang subject, refused to accept it. Emperor Zhuangzong rewrote his communication as a letter (thus showing equality between the states), but slightly displayed superiority by addressing the letter, \\"The letter from the Emperor of the Great Tang to the Lord of Wu.\\" Yang Pu responded, also with a letter (thus also showing equality) but also showed deference by addressing the letter, \\"The respectful letter from the Lord of the Great Wu to the Emperor of the Great Tang.\\" Shortly after, he also sent the official Lu Ping () as an emissary to Later Tang. Upon Lu's return, he confirmed Yan's observations ‚Äî that Emperor Zhuangzong was wasting his time on tours and games, and was stingy with his funds, not willing to dispense them to soldiers, and thus causing discontent. While Xu was in firm control of the Wu governance, in 924 Yang Pu was able to show some measure of sovereignty. At that time, there was an occasion when went to the port of Baisha (ÁôΩÊ≤ô, in modern Yangzhou) to review the fleet, and he changed Baisha's name to Yingluan Base (ËøéÈëæ, \\"Base that Welcomed the Emperor's Train\\"). Xu, who was then stationed at Jinling with Xu Zhigao at Jiangdu overseeing the government on his behalf, came to pay homage to him, and Yang Pu used this chance to complain about Xu's associate Zhai Qian (), whom Xu had put in control of the palace, as Zhai had put much restrictions on the King's movements and was spying on the King's moves. (Yang initiated the complaint by intentionally referring to rain (Èõ®, yu) as \\"water\\" (Ê∞¥, shui), as Zhai's father's name was Zhai Yu, and Yang claimed that he, even as sovereign, felt so intimidated by Zhai that he had to observe naming taboo for Zhai's father.) Xu, realizing Yang's complaint, bowed and offered to put Zhai to death, but Yang stated that that was unnecessary but that an exile would be sufficient, so Xu exiled Zhai to Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. In 925, Qian Liu, the king of Wu's southeastern neighbor Wuyue (formally a vassal of Later Tang's), sent an emissary to Wu to inform Wu that he had been created the King of Wuyue by Emperor Zhuangzong. Wu, under the rationale that Wuyue was having designs on its own territory by accepting a title that included \\"Wu\\" in its name, refused to receive the emissary, and further cut off diplomatic and trade relations with Wuyue.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. In 926, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at the Later Tang capital Luoyang. His adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who led another mutiny and who shortly after arrived at Luoyang, declared himself emperor (as Emperor Mingzong) to succeed him. Yang sent an emissary to him to establish friendly relations (and offering fresh tea leaves as a tribute), but also internally declared a period for Emperor Zhuangzong.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 3. In 927 there was an incident when the senior general Chai Zaiyong () came to pay homage to the emperor, but was wearing his armor ‚Äî which was inappropriate, and he was indicted by an imperial censor. Chai, however, citing his battlefield accomplishments, refused to accept the punishment. However, Xu Zhigao then tried to restore discipline by intentionally \\"accidentally\\" intruding into the palace, and then immediately withdrawing and submitting a petition asking to be punished for this intrusion. Yang issued an edict declining any punishment, but Xu Zhigao insisted on being punished by being stripped of one month's salary. It was said that this move restored discipline among the Wu officials.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Meanwhile, as the years went by, Xu Wen's biological son Xu Zhixun was repeatedly trying to persuade Xu Wen to have him replace Xu Zhigao as the overseer of the Wu government, and Xu Wen's associates Yan and Xu Jie were advocating the same, but Xu Wen was hesitant because Xu Zhigao was filially pious and careful, and his concubine Lady Chen also argued against it, pointing out that Xu Zhigao had been a son to him ever since the time that he was of low position, and should not now be abandoned. However, by late 927 he had resolved to do so, so he was preparing to go to Jiangdu from Jinling to urge Yang Pu to declare himself as emperor, and then use that opportunity to reassign both Xu Zhixun and Xu Zhigao. As he was about to depart Jinling, however, he became ill, and so he sent Xu Zhixun in his stead. Xu Zhigao, hearing the news, prepared to resign and request the post of military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but while Xu Zhixun was on the way, Xu Wen died. Xu Zhixun rushed back to Jinling to take care of the aftermaths of his father's death, and Xu Zhigao remained as junior regent. Yang posthumously created Xu Wen the Prince of Qi. Shortly after, pursuant to Xu Wen's last wishes, Yang declared himself emperor. He posthumously honored his father Yang Xingmi and brothers Yang Wo and Yang Longyan emperors as well. Hearing the news, Emperor Mingzong's chief of staff An Chonghui advocated a campaign against Wu, but Emperor Mingzong declined. == As Emperor of Wu  Early reign as emperor === Yang Pu, after taking imperial title, honored his mother Queen Dowager Wang as empress dowager. He also created his brothers, his sons, and Yang Longyan's son Yang Fen () imperial princes. After Xu Wen's death, his offices were divided between Xu Zhigao and Xu Zhixun, but the brothers' continued to be rivals, with Xu Zhigao in control of the imperial government at Jiangdu and Xu Zhixun in control of Wu's largest army at Jinling. In winter 929, Xu Zhigao tricked Xu Zhixun into coming to Jiangdu to defend himself against charges of impropriety, and detained him once he was at Jiangdu. He took over the command of Xu Zhixun's army, thus consolidating power into his own hands. In 930, Yang Pu created his oldest son Yang Lian, whom he had previously created the Prince of Jiangdu, crown prince. Also in 930, Xu Zhigao left Jiangdu and took the defense post at Jinling but continued to serve as regent (as his father Xu Wen did), leaving his son Xu Jingtong at Jiangdu to serve as junior regent, assisted by Wang Lingmou and Song Qiqiu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. === Late reign as emperor === In 933, Song Qiqiu advocated that Wu's capital be moved from Jiangdu to Jinling. Xu Zhigao thereafter began to build palaces there. He also built a mansion for himself, preparing to welcome Yang Pu to Jinling.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. (The project was eventually abandoned in 934 when Xu Zhigao's associate Zhou Zong pointed out that given the importance of both Jinling and Jiangdu, if the Wu capital were moved to Jinling, Xu Zhigao himself would have to head to Jiangdu to take up post there, which would merely mean additional expense, and that this capital movement lacked popular support.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Also in 933, Yang Pu created his wife Consort Wang, who had previously carried the title of Defei (), empress. Shortly after, there was an incident where Later Tang's emissary to Wuyue, Zhang Wenbao (), who was going by the sea route to Wuyue, suffered a shipwreck, and his lifeboat, on which only five of his delegation of 200 survived, floated all the way into Wu territory, to Tianchang (Â§©Èï∑, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), where they were taken by Wu forces. Yang treated Zhang and the other survivors well, giving him gifts and also notified Wuyue to send a delegation to receive Zhang and his followers on Wu and Wuyue's border. Zhang, however, would only accept food and not the other gifts, stating, \\"My government had long not had communications with Wu. We are not subject and lord, nor are we guest and host. If I accept the gifts, what can I give in return?\\" Yang much appreciated his honesty. Meanwhile, Xu Zhigao had long had designs on the throne himself, but as Yang Pu was considered virtuous and without fault, he initially decided to wait until after Yang Pu's reign to take the throne, and this plan was agreed with by his chief strategist Song. However, one day, when Xu was in Zhou Zong's presence, he, as he plucked white facial hair, stated, \\"The state is safe, but I am getting old.\\" Zhou knew that Xu was getting impatient, and therefore volunteered to head to Jiangdu to hint the matter to the emperor and Song. Song was surprised that Zhou would be the one, not he, who would be consulted on this matter, and headed to Jinling himself and tried to dissuade Xu, and he further asked that Zhou be executed as an apology to the emperor. Xu, surprised by Song's opposition but not wishing to push the matter at the moment, exiled Zhou. (However, later, when Li Jianxun and Xu Jie also advocated that Xu Zhigao took the throne, Xu Zhigao recalled Zhou and distanced himself from Song.) Later in 934, Yang issued an edict bestowing the great honors of Grand Chancellor (Â§ß‰∏ûÁõ∏, Da Chengxiang), Shangfu (\\"imperial father\\"), and Prince of Qi on Xu Zhigao, and also prepared to bestow the nine bestowments on him. Xu declined these honors. Xu's preparations for taking the throne continued, however. As he feared that Yang Meng would rise against him, he had others accuse Yang Meng of hosting criminals and hoarding weapons, and had Yang Meng demoted to the rank of duke and had him put under house arrest at He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui). He also summoned Xu Jingtong back to Jinling to serve as his deputy, while sending another son, Xu Jingqian (), to Jiangdu to oversee the government. In winter 935, when Yang again issued an edict granting Xu Zhigao the titles of Shangfu, Taishi (), Grand Chancellor, Generalissimo (Â§ßÂÖÉÂ∏•, Da Yuanshuai), and Prince of Qi, carving 10 prefectures out of Wu territory to constitute the Principality of Qi. Xu accepted the Prince of Qi, Taishi, and Generalissimo titles at that time, declining the Shangfu and Grand Chancellor titles. In summer 936, due to Xu Jingqian's suffering from an illness, Yang relieved him from his posts; the posts, as well as the responsibility of overseeing the Wu government, were given to his brother Xu Jingsui.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. (Xu Jingqian would die of his illness in spring 937.) In winter 936, Yang formally permitted Xu's Principality of Qi to maintain all the governmental offices that an imperial government would have, and declared Jinling the western capital. (Xu Zhigao implemented this edict in spring 937, and also renamed himself Xu Gao.) In fall 937, Yang Meng, believing that Xu Gao was about to take the throne, decided to take one last chance to save Wu. He assassinated the commander of the guard corps left to guard him, Wang Hong (), and then fled to the territory of the senior Wu general Zhou Ben the military governor of Desheng Circuit (Âæ∑Âãù, headquartered in modern Hefei). Zhou initially wanted to receive Yang Meng, but Zhou Ben's son Zhou Hongzuo () detained Zhou Ben and arrested Yang Meng. Xu Gao, in Yang Pu's name, ordered Yang Meng demoted to commoner rank and executed. Shortly after, Yang Pu issued an edict passing the throne to Xu Gao. In winter 937, Xu Gao accepted, establishing Southern Tang (as its Emperor Liezu). == After yielding the throne to Southern Tang == Instead of the usual dynastic transitions, where the new emperor would create the old emperor a noble title, the new Southern Tang emperor submitted a petition (i.e., still acting as if he were a subject) to Yang Pu, stating: Yang Pu, finding it untenable for the Southern Tang emperor to still be claiming to be his subject, wrote a letter back declining this humility. The Southern Tang emperor wrote another submission (i.e., still in the form of a subject) thanking him, but continued to use the formality of a subject. Apparently to ward off any beliefs that he would have designs on taking power back, Yang Pu often wore robes made of feathers and spent his time studying Taoist disciplines that purportedly would lead to divinity. He, however, was still fearful of the situation, and he repeatedly asked to move out of the old Wu palace. With Li Decheng also advocating the same before the Southern Tang emperor, in summer 938, Emperor Liezu converted the inner city of Run Prefecture (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) into Danyang Palace, and moved Yang Pu there. Shortly after, all members of the imperial Yang clan were also moved into the Danyang Palace, which was then put under heavy guard. Around new year 939, Yang Pu died. Emperor Liezu declared a lengthy mourning period for him, and honored him posthumously as Emperor Rui. (Due to the quickness of his death after yielding the throne, it was commonly believed that he was killed on the new emperor's orders, although definitive proof was lacking.) == Personal information == * Father ** Yang Xingmi, posthumously honored Emperor Wu * Mother ** Lady Wang, Yang Xingmi's concubine * Wife ** Empress Wang (created 933) * Children ** Yang Lian (), initially the Prince of Jiangdu (created 928), later Crown Prince (created 930), later the Duke of Hongnong during Southern Tang (created 938, d. 940), posthumously honored Prince Jing of Hongnong ** Yang Lin (), the Prince of Jiangxia (created 928), later the Duke of Jiangxia during Southern Tang ** Yang Qiu (), the Prince of Yichun (created 928) ** Princess Shangrao, wife of Xu Jingqian, son of Xu Zhigao, posthumously honored Lady Zhenzhuang of Yan == Notes and references == * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (), vol. 3. * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 134. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 61. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281. - Category:900 births Category:939 deaths Category:People from Yangzhou Category:Yang Wu people born during Tang Category:Yang Wu rulers Category:Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms emperors Category:Southern Tang Taoists ","title":"Yang Pu"},{"id":"9097984","text":"The First and Second International Islamic Unity Conference were conferences organized by followers of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order in Los Angeles (1996) and Washington DC (1998). Sufi and Sufi-friendly Muslim representatives, Islamic scholars and politicians were invited to the conferences. The conferences exemplified the Haqqani-Naqshbandis' ambitions to establish itself as a major player within the American Muslim scene. The conference was supported in part by members of royalty, Muslim political and religious leaders from across the world. ==First International Unity Conference== Speakers at a panel discussion during the 1996 conference in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles conference was from August 2 through the 4th, 1996, some 7,000 attendees and over 125 speakers from around the globe attended a three-day marathon of lectures, parallel workshop sessions, prayer, praise of Muhammad and Islamic social interaction. Officially known as the International Islamic Unity Conference, it started off with a press session on Friday morning and ended with a parade through downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Attendees praised the organizers for an excellent, though intense schedule of speeches by muftis, Islamic scholars, international political leaders, American political figures and an array of interfaith events. Chaired by Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, the conference was sponsored by As-Sunnah Foundation of America, the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order and by a number of other charitable and religious organizations. Shaykh Kabbani and Nazim al- Haqqani in prayer with others at the Los Angeles conference. Many felt the conference organization was exemplary, the facilities at the Los Angeles' Westin Bonaventure Hotel excellent and the wide variety of cultural food and Islamic entertainment very apropos for such an international event. The many San Francisco Bay Area attendees were happy to find a number of prominent local Islamic activists featured, as well as those from national ISNA, IQRA, MPAC and other national Islamic organizations well represented. The spirit of unity was especially apparent at the \\"Peace in the Streets\\" session, where about 20 former gang leaders, along with the popular rap star MC Hammer, took shahada with Shaykh Nazim al-Qubrusi, Grand-mufti of Cyprus and worldwide leader of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order. Attendees were treated to sessions on politics, importance of schools of thought, purification of the heart, establishing Islamic economic power, educational curriculum initiative and many other subjects, discussed from the main podium as well as in intimate workshops where speakers and attendees were able to express their views. A major event occurred on Saturday night, with the launching of the International Day of the Orphan, which is expected, given the sponsorship of California's Assembly, and endorsement by a number of international organizations, to become a globally sponsored day for recalling the plight of orphans and children in difficulty. ==Second International Unity Conference== The Second International Unity Conference was held in August of 1998 in Washington D.C. The second conference was sponsored by the newly-formed Islamic Supreme Council of America and again chaired by Shaykh Kabbani. Islamic world unity was the theme of the second conference, however topics related to both domestic and political issues were also on the agenda. ==References== ==See also== *As-Sunnah Foundation of America *Islamic Supreme Council of America Category:International conferences in the United States Category:1996 conferences Category:1998 conferences Category:Islam and politics Category:1996 in Islam Category:1998 in Islam ","title":"International Islamic Unity Conference (US)"},{"id":"9097990","text":"Brian Jones (10 December 1938 ‚Äì 25 June 2009) was a British poet. He was educated at Ealing County Grammar School for Boys and Selwyn College, Cambridge. Jones' first major collection, Poems (consisting of his first book, The Madman in the Reading Room and thirty-seven other poems), was published in 1966, and proved to be successful. Those poems dealt with both the joy and the unease that may be present beneath the surface of what seems to be placid middle-class domesticity. This was very much in a style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and Jones was described by Edward Lucie-Smith in a 1970 anthology of post-war British poetry as \\"certainly one of the very best practitioners of this overworked vein\\".British Poetry since 1945 ed. Edward Lucie-Smith. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1970. Subsequent critical assessments of his work have included the following: \\"Jones believes that poetry need not surrender to fiction all the stories that need telling, but his poems retain the tightness of verse and the authority of good cadences. There is as much truth to surface detail in his work as in any recent novel, with a good deal of eloquence added.\\" ‚Äì Peter Porter \\"It is his concern with truth-telling that unifies Brian Jones‚Äôs work and gives The Island Normal its strength, a poetry austere without coldness and colloquial without slackness. Why is he so little known, so rarely discussed?\\" ‚Äì Grevel Lindop \\"[Jones‚Äôs] leveller-like anger at England‚Äôs waste of human potential arises from a deep love of his inheritance and a real fear for its future.

It is approximately in length and lies above sea level, the maximum depth is some The main tributaries are the Dessarry and the Pean which flow through the glens of the same names, falling into the loch at the extreme west end, by the settlement of Strathan. The mountains of Lochaber lie to the north, and the Forest of Locheil to the south. The outflow is through the River Arkaig at the extreme southeast of the loch, which flows eastwards miles to Loch Lochy, passing Achnacarry. Two small islands lie at the eastern end of the loch, the larger of which, Island Columbkill, or Eilean Loch Airceig, is the site of a ruined chapel dedicated to St Columba which is the former burial ground of the Camerons of Locheil. A road from the Great Glen follows the north shore of the loch to Strathan where paths lead on to Knoydart, Glenfinnan and Loch Morar. In 1746, Jacobite funds were said to have been hidden here (see Loch Arkaig treasure). In common with a number of other Scottish lochs, Loch Arkaig was at one time supposed to be the home of a water horse. James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury and twice foreign minister during Queen Victoria's reign, recorded in his Memoirs of an Ex-Minister: :\\"October 3rd, 1857. This morning my stalker and his boy gave me an account of a mysterious creature, which they say exists in Loch Arkaig, and which they call the Lake-Horse. It is the same animal of which one has occasionally read accounts in newspapers as having been seen in the Highland lochs, and of the existence of which in Loch Assynt the late Lord Ellesmere wrote an interesting article, but hitherto the story has always been looked upon as fabulous. I am now, however, nearly persuaded of its truth. My stalker, John Stuart, at Achnacarry, has seen it twice, and both times at sunrise on a bright sunny day, when there was not a ripple on the water. The creature was basking on the surface; he only saw the head and hind quarters, proving that its back was hollow, which is not the shape of any fish or of a seal. Its head resembled that of a horse.... The Highlanders are very superstitious about this creature. They are convinced that there is never more than one in existence at the same time, and I believe they think it has something diabolical in its nature, for when I said I wished I could get within shot of it, my stalker observed very gravely: 'Perhaps your Lordship's gun would miss fire.'\\" ==External links== * Overview at the Gazetteer for Scotland Category:Lochs of Highland (council area) Category:Freshwater lochs of Scotland Category:Lochaber ","title":"Loch Arkaig"},{"id":"9098127","text":"KMJK (107.3 FM) is an urban adult contemporary radio station serving the Kansas City metropolitan area. Licensed to North Kansas City, Missouri, the Cumulus Media, Inc. outlet operates at 107.3 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW from a transmitter in Napoleon, Missouri. KMJK's studios are located in Overland Park, Kansas. KMJK's main competitor is long-standing heritage station KPRS. It is the only Urban AC-formatted station in Kansas City. KMJK is the Kansas City affiliate for both the \\"Rick & Sasha in the Morning\\" show and The D.L. Hughley Show. In 2011, with Cumulus Media's acquisition of Citadel Media, Cumulus announced the station would be spun off and put into a trust called Volt Media, LLC in order to meet FCC mandates on ownership limitations, despite that Citadel does not own any stations in Kansas City. However, in October of the same year, Cumulus announced plans to reacquire the station. ==HistoryEarly years=== What is now KMJK started broadcasting on September 11, 1969 at 106.3 FM as KLEX-FM, as the station's city of license was Lexington, Missouri and a transmitter just north of Odessa, Missouri. The format was country music. The station's call letters changed to KBEK-FM in 1976, and relocated to 107.3 in 1981 with a class C signal. The station was locally owned by Lexington Broadcasters until being sold in September 1989. In 1984, the station changed formats to satellite-fed Adult contemporary as KCAC. On December 1, 1988, the station changed formats back to country and changed call letters to KCFM. The station was acquired by Meyer Communications in September 1989. ===Top 40 as KXXR/KISF=== KCFM swapped formats and frequencies with Capitol Broadcasting's KXXR (a Top 40 station at 106.5 FM, now WDAF-FM) on February 16, 1992 at Midnight. The first song played after the swap was \\"I'm Too Sexy\\" by Right Said Fred. Meyer continued to own the station, while being operated by Capitol via an LMA.\\"KXXR will move down, not off, the dial\\", The Kansas City Star, February 8, 1992.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-02-14.pdf The KXXR call letters would officially move to 107.3 FM on March 13, 1992 (106.5, meanwhile, adopted the KKCJ call letters four days earlier). US Radio, led by Philadelphia attorney Ragan Henry who owned other radio stations across the country, would buy the station in October 1992. On February 4, 1993, after 24 hours of stunting with a loop of \\"Kiss\\" by Prince, the station changed call letters and monikers to KISF, \\"Kiss 107.3\\".\\"KXXR, now KISF, goes to Top 40\\", The Kansas City Star, February 5, 1993.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-12.pdf After KBEQ's unannounced flip to Country later that month, KISF was the only Top 40 station in the market until KMXV flipped from AC to Top 40 in March 1994. KMXV also had a signal that covered the entire Kansas City metro. Despite the station's coverage area being mainly east of Kansas City, KISF still received decent ratings.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1993-2.pdfhttps://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1994-2.pdfhttps://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1995-1.pdf ===Modern rock era=== During the mid-1990s, alternative rock was becoming the popular sound of the decade, as the Top 40 format was entering a period of decline. Deciding to follow the trend, and to compete against KLZR, KISF started evolving towards modern rock with a lean on 1980s new wave in late 1994, with the shift complete by January 1995, including a slight name change to \\"107.3 Kiss FM\\".\\"KISF-FM bumps urban sounds for a 'new rock' format\\", The Kansas City Star, January 20, 1995.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-01-13.pdf The station initially had trouble gaining an audience, largely because the station hung on to remnants of its former format, including imaging and presentation.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/R&R-1996-1-Fall-95.pdf; In addition, the station shifted through several morning shows. Due to US Radio's financing balloon bank note becoming due, Henry was forced to sell his 49-station empire, with KISF being bought by Metropolitan Radio Group in April 1996. Syncom bought the station in May 1997. The station rebranded as \\"107-3 The X\\" on March 16, 1997, and took the new calls KCCX on June 25 of that year.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-03-28.pdf Classic rock station KCFX nearly threatened to sue the station because the call letters were too similar. To remedy this, the call letters were changed to KNRX on March 1, 1998. During this time, the station started leaning towards the active rock route by playing harder-edged rock acts, in order to compete with KQRC. The station's airstaff included Kansas City-native Mancow Muller in morning drive, Jason Justice, \\"The Morning (and later on, Afternoon) Headrush\\" w/ Jay and Sammye, and Roach and Sumo hosting \\"The Midnight Moshpit\\", as well as carrying \\"Off the Beaten Track\\" featuring a freeform format on Friday (and later, Sunday) nights, \\"Resurrection Sunday\\" and the syndicated \\"Out of Order Countdown\\" w/ Jed the Fish on weekends. Despite being Kansas City's only modern rock outlet (especially during a time when the format was very popular nationwide), the station's ratings were only modest during this time, usually in the mid 2 shares (12+), most likely because of the station's signal issues and poor management.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/R&R-1997-2-Spring-97.pdf; By the fall of 1997, the station's ratings plummeted to 15th place with a 1.5 share (12+).https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/RR-1998-2.pdfhttps://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Ratings- Directories/R&R-1999-1-Fall-98.pdf; Mancow's show would later be dropped in Fall of 1998. ===Urban oldies as \\"K-107\\"=== At 10:04 a.m. on January 5, 1999, without warning, KNRX dropped the modern rock format. Jason Justice played the final song on \\"The X\\", which was the acoustic version of \\"Plush\\" by Stone Temple Pilots and announced a live legal ID that ended in \\"Boom\\". The station then began stunting with a ticking clock and a loop of \\"1999\\" by Prince. The following day at Noon, KNRX flipped formats to urban oldies. The station went by the moniker and slogan \\"K-107, The Rhythm & Soul of Kansas City\\".\\"Round and round KC radio stations' formats; 102.1 shifts into mainstream 'Star 102', 107.3 plays Prince to promote switch\\", The Kansas City Star, January 6, 1999.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-01-15.pdf\\"KC radio scene left with...no alternatives; Ratings weren't high enough to support teen-friendly formats\\", The Kansas City Star, February 5, 1999.

During the summer of that year, the station moved towards its current Urban AC format with the new moniker \\"Majik 107.3\\". In October 2003, the station, along with Radio 2000-owned KCHZ, was purchased by Cumulus Media and in the Summer of 2004, the station altered its moniker to \\"Magic 107.3\\". In 2008, the station changed its city of license to North Kansas City, Missouri. The station also had a construction permit to move its transmitter to a site near Levasy, Missouri. Over the course of 2018, KMJK began dropping most of their classic soul and pre-1990s music from their playlist, and began adding more hip hop tracks, in order to better compete against KPRS. During the fall of 2019, the station also began de-emphasizing the \\"Magic\\" moniker, rebranding to using just their frequency. Other uses of KMJK *KMJK was originally located in Phoenix, Arizona and owned by Mobley Broadcasting Inc. The station was built in 1991 as a docket 80-90 station to specially provide service to the African American community. The station was constructed by long time Phoenix area broadcaster, Arthur Mobley and his wife Vicki Wilson - Mobley with support from SYNCOM. The station was moved after being purchased in December 2000. Like the current format, the Phoenix station of the same call letters, was also Urban Adult Contemporary and carried Tom Joyner in the morning. KMJK Majik 107 (106.9) in Phoenix accepted the spelling of MaJiK as the original Arabic phonetic spelling of the word. The Phoenix station provided a progressive urban radio format with music, news, features and talk. The Phoenix station was partially owned by Syncom. *In 1977, KMJK Magic 107 first went on the air from Lake Oswego, Oregon on 106.7 MHz (now KLTH, another set of call letters used by a Kansas City radio station (KZPT)). The station was owned by Communico Northwest Corp. (Frederic W. Constant and partners) with studios located in \\"Magic Manor\\" (the historic 1905 \\"Tug Master's House\\" at 107 Burnham Road). The Magic 107 format was an early version of what has evolved into AAA (Triple-A), Adult-Album-Alternative. Programmed by morning host Archer, the Progressive, Soft-Album Rock station developed a small but solid 18- to 34-year-old audience. KMJK enjoyed moderate, low-budget success while competing with then-KVAN 1480 AM (The Mono Maniacs) and dominant market leaders KINK and KGON. In 1979, after formally adopting dual city of license (Lake Oswego-Portland), Magic 107 was purchased by Harte-Hanks Southern Communications, Inc. and became The Magic FM. The format changed to Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) with a semi-highbrow, semi-comedic air staff of successful, medium/major market programmers and veteran air personalities. The debut air staff included: Beau Rafferty (6‚Äì10a); John Shomby, Program Director (10a‚ÄìNoon); Dave McKay (Noon‚Äì3p); Pat Clarke (3‚Äì6p); \\"Dancin'\\" Danny Wright (6‚Äì10p); Chaz Kelly (10p‚Äì2a); \\"Allen Wesley\\" Archer (2‚Äì6a).

Boathouses can be seen on the opposite bank of the River Cam, and houseboats are visible on the river The River Cam at Midsummer Common with the Fort St George public house on the left and the Victoria Avenue Bridge in the background The footbridge across the Cam at Midsummer Common, with houseboats Cambridge Midsummer Fair on Midsummer Common, 2005 Midsummer Common is an area of common land in Cambridge, England. It lies northeast of the city centre on the south bank of the River Cam. The common borders the River Cam and houseboats are often moored on the common's bank. The boathouses of most of the colleges of Cambridge University are on the opposite bank. ==Events== Regular major events held on the Common include The May Day Fair, Strawberry Fair and fireworks on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November, which regularly attract around 25,000 people. Other events include fun runs and cycling events where the common is used as a start and finish point. A vigil and lantern floating ceremony took place on the common on Hiroshima Memorial Day in 2006. ===Midsummer Fair=== Cambridge Midsummer Fair was granted a charter by King John in 1211, and was originally held on or near the feast of St Etheldreda. Originally a trade fair, income from the event went to the Barnwell Priory. In the sixteenth century the council and Mayor of Cambridge acquired the rights for the midsummer fair, with University Proctors retaining the right to search the fair for beggars, vagabonds and lewd women. The latter right in particular was hotly disputed. In the 18th century was named the Pot fair due to the quantity of China traded there, and it was popular among gypsy travellers for trade in horse and cattle. In more recent times it has become a pleasure fair with amusements taking the place of trade in goods. It is heavily attended and has recently given rise to problems of safety and public order and with litter. ==Grazing== Red Poll bullock on Midsummer Common In March 2006 Geoffrey King, who later became the chairman of the Friends of Midsummer Common, put up ¬£20 to investigate the possibility of introducing a \\"residents‚Äô herd\\" of cows to the common, at a meeting of the Brunswick and North Kite Residents' Association. On 7 April 2007, when there had been no cattle on the common for a number of years, a small number of Red Poll bullocks, owned by a Cambridge resident, were introduced to the common. The grazing of cattle on the common is controversial, given the other uses to which the common is put, which may conflict with grazing. ==Designation as a Common== Midsummer Common is registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Cambridge City Council uses the term 'park' when describing the common: > Midsummer Common is classified as a Common located in an urban landscape in > the centre of the city. The landscape setting affords opportunities to hold > large events in a variety of formats. Jesus Green was separated from Midsummer Common in 1890 when Victoria Avenue was built. Jesus Green is no longer maintained in a state suitable for grazing. In 1930, Jesus College exchanged land between what is now the Cutter Ferry bridge and Elizabeth Way for part of Butt's Green on the Jesus College side of Victoria Avenue. ==Butt's Green== Butt's Green is an area which, historically used for archery butts, is now part of Midsummer Common. The Butt's Green area is less disturbed by events than the other areas and tends to have a wider diversity of plant life. ==Antisocial behaviour== Midsummer Common, along with wide swathes of Cambridge City, has been a designated area under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, s 20(3)-(5). During much of Winter 2006/07 this order only applied in the evenings and apparently applied to the whole common; as of February 2007 a new authorisation which was brought into force on 3 January 2006 and lasting for six months was publicised. This only applied to the boundary path, and one corner of the common. The area of the common designated under the act does not include the public toilets or the area in which half of the City's redeployable CCTV cameras have been deployed within 100 m of each other. To quote from the order made by Superintendent Simon Megikcs: > I give this order with the consent of the Cambridge City Council on the > grounds that despite interventions to curb significant and persistent > antisocial behaviour caused by groups of persons collecting and settling in > the local area such problems persist. This has led members of the local > business community to feel intimidated and harassed. Conduct of persons > includes street drinking and rowdy behaviour verbally abusing and > intimidating passers by, urinating in the street, allowing dogs to run off > their leads, drug misuse in public toilets rough sleeping and aggressive > begging and street drug misuse and purchase leading to an influx of street > dealers. This applies to a large area of Cambridge including Mill Road, Parker's Piece, Christ's Pieces, Midsummer Common, Brunswick Gardens and Riverside. Photograph of the area of Midsummer Common designated under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act Plan of the area of Midsummer Common designated under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act with the designated area hatched (grey) The notice state that the order has been made with the consent of the City Council. Past practice suggests that this would have been given by a \\"Leader‚Äôs decision\\". Council policy states that such decisions must be reported to [party] Group Leaders immediately and to the next available meeting of the Scrutiny Committee - no such decision was brought to the Scrutiny meeting on 10 January 2007. ===Designated Public Places Order=== Cambridge City Council believe that a Designated Public Places Order cannot be applied to the common, such an order might be a more appropriate manner of dealing with alcohol-related anti-social behaviour on the common. > The Council are applying for open-ended ‚Äúpremises licenses‚Äù for the whole > extent of the open spaces. Owing to what we think is an unintended quirk in > the legislation, DPPO controls cannot be enforced on land where a ‚Äúpremises > license‚Äù is in force. Premises Licences are ‚Äúin force‚Äù for the whole period > during which they are valid, not just for periods during which alcohol is > being served. This would prevent the use of DPPO powers on these open spaces > and could therefore give rise to a displacement issue if DPPO controls are > in force in adjoining areas. We understand that this problem has been raised > with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, but do not know whether > steps will be taken to address it.\\" ==Representative associations== The Friends of Midsummer CommonFriends of Midsummer Common. was inaugurated in October 2006, initially made up of owners of residential property surrounding the common. Its founding chairman was Geoffrey King who resigned from the Brunswick & North Kite Residents Association before setting up the Friends of Midsummer Common. Their objectives include: \\"to work with organisers to ensure that events have minimal impact and cause no nuisance to local residents;\\". Alistair Wilson, Cambridge City Council's Green Space Manager was reported to have wanted a Friends of Midsummer Common group set up in May 2006.

It is the oldest church structure on the Upper East Side.Gray, Christopher. STREETSCAPES: St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church; A Touch of the English Countryside in Manhattan. New York Times April 2, 1989. Accessed August 7, 2017. The church is Anglo-Catholic in doctrine and style, and has an extensive music program. The services are in traditional language and reflect the Anglican and Western Catholic traditions of liturgy and music. The parish was unusual in the Diocese of New York for its conservative stances, under the leadership of Bishop Albert A. Chambers, on the ordination of women.Lambert, Bruce. Albert A. Chambers, 86, Bishop Who Fought Women in Priesthood. The New York Times June 20, 1993. Accessed August 26, 2017 ==History== The Church of the Resurrection was founded in 1868 as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre by a group of Episcopalians. An armory for the 7th New York Militia was built nearby, and its chaplain, the Reverend James Tuttle Smith, became the first rector. The building was completed in 1869, and was designed by James Renwick Jr., who had earlier built Grace Church in Manhattan, and went on to design the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Due to problems and lack of funds, his designs were not completely executed. The Great Rood of 1940 was carved by the Dutch sculptor Joep Nicholas. Since 1920, the Church of the Resurrection has been Anglo-Catholic in worship and doctrine. ==Resurrection Episcopal Day School== Resurrection Episcopal Day School is an independent, non-profit Montessori early childhood development school for children 3 years through 6 years of age. Housed in the parish building of the Church of the Resurrection, the school is a short distance from Central Park on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It provides the following programs: #The Montessori Program #The Arts #Creative Movement and Physical Development #Afternoon Enrichment Program #Afternoon School Activities #Summer Camp ==Music programs== Resurrection's musicians offer settings of the Mass, motets, and other music every Sunday and on many feasts, often with a chamber orchestra. The choir is composed of professional singers, who appear on Sundays and major feast-days throughout the season. The hymns sung are drawn from the 1940 Hymnal, the New English Hymnal, and many other sources. Several small orchestras and early music groups present concerts at Resurrection. ==Worship services== Solemn Mass is celebrated on Sunday mornings according to the English Missal, with full ceremonial, choir, hymns, and a choral Mass setting. During the summer months a Sung Mass is offered instead of the regular Solemn Mass. It includes hymns and a setting of the Ordinary of the Mass for congregational singing. Low Mass is offered at 8:30 am on Sundays and daily through the week at regularly scheduled times. Other services vary with the monthly schedule, and notice can be found on the website. ==See also== *Guild of All Souls *St Magnus-the- Martyr ==ReferencesResurrection Episcopal Day School Category:Churches in Manhattan Category:Episcopal church buildings in New York City Category:Anglo-Catholic church buildings in the United States Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York City Category:Churches completed in 1869 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:James Renwick Jr. church buildings Category:Upper East Side Category:1868 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Church of the Resurrection (Manhattan)"},{"id":"9098178","text":"Armand Mouyal (13 October 1925 - 15 July 1988) was a French epee world champion fencer. ==Early and personal life== Born in Oran, French Algeria, Mouyal was Jewish.Day by Day in Jewish Sports History - Bob WechslerJews and the Olympic Games: sport: a springboard for minorities - Paul Yogi Mayer ==Fencing career== Mouyal began fencing in the early 1950s. ===National championships=== Mouyal, a French police officer, won the French national individual √©p√©e title in 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, and 1959. ===World championships=== Mouyal won the world individual √©p√©e championship in 1957.

Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions, which build up between the offering date and the purchase date. At the purchase date, the company uses the accumulated funds to purchase shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees. The amount of the discount depends on the specific plan but can be as much as 15% lower than the market price. Depending on when the employee sells the shares, the disposition will be classified as either qualified or not qualified. If the position is sold two years after the offering date and at least one year after the purchase date, the shares will fall under a qualified disposition. If the shares are sold within two years of the offering date or within one year after the purchase date the disposition will not be qualified. These positions will have different tax implications.

She died from cancer at her home in Randolph, Vermont, in 2012, aged 89. ==Early life== Merrill was born on January 27, 1923, in Rochester, New York, to Earl and Elsie Almetta Merrill. She grew up on the shores of Lake Ontario in Webster, New York (now a suburb of Rochester). Merrill received her Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Theatre in 1944 from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. She received her master's degree from Wellesley College in 1945. Ronni Solbert was her illustrator and \\"companion\\" for almost 50 years. ==Editor== After leaving Wellesley, Merrill was an editor for Scholastic Magazines from 1945 to 1949. She subsequently edited at Literary Cavalcade from 1950 to 1957. Starting in 1952, Merrill held a Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Madras in India. Her folklore studies in India would lead her to write a number of stories based on Asian folklore: Shan's Lucky Knife (1960, based on a Burmese folktale), The Superlative Horse (1961, based on a Chinese folktale), and The Girl Who Loved Caterpillars (1992, based on a Japanese tale). From 1965 to 1971, Merrill worked as an editor and consultant at the Publications Division of the Bank Street College of Education. With biographical sketch. ==Writer== Merrill started writing books while working at Literary Cavalcade, including Henry, The Hand-Painted Mouse (1951) and The Woover (1952). Merrill received the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1963 for The Superlative Horse. In 1964, Merrill published her best-known work, The Pushcart War, for which she won her second Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, in 1965. Set in New York, the book was written in the style of a historical report from the future, looking back at earlier events from a class warfare struggle between trucking companies and pushcart owners. Alberta Eiseman of The New York Times wrote that \\"it's rare to find a book for young people with both a point of view and a sense of the ridiculous.\\" The book has been reissued a number of times, with the dates adjusted to keep it set in the future. In 2006, a musical adaptation was presented by Edric Haleen in Holt, Michigan. Merrill published The Black Sheep in 1969. In The New York Times Book Review, Natalie Babbitt wrote that \\"her fable is a satisfying sandwich in which the peanut butter, sticky and nourishing, slides down with ease due to judicious use of jelly.\\" This was followed in 1972 by The Toothpaste Millionaire. Set in Cleveland, the story relates how a Caucasian sixth-grader girl who just moved into town becomes friends with her neighbor and classmate, an African-American boy entrepreneur, and becomes rich by selling their home- made toothpaste. In 1974, an ABC afternoon special was based on The Toothpaste Millionaire. The Toothpaste Millionaire has been used in the classroom to integrate lessons from a number of different subject areas: entrepreneurship, marketing, manufacturing of toothpaste, and the social issues associated with race in the story's setting. In 1992, Merrill published The Girl Who Loved Caterpillars, based on a 12th-century Japanese tale. True to the original manuscript, whose ending had been lost, the story ends abruptly. Books had a great impact on Merrill as a child, which motivated her to try to write children's stories that would have a similar effect. Her books often illustrate universal human values serving to resolve conflict. Most of her books were illustrated by her companion of over 50 years, Ronni Solbert. ==Bibliography== * Henry, The Hand-Painted Mouse. New York: Coward-McCann, 1951. * The Woover.

It equals 4.8 litres, or about 1.056 imperial gallons, in today's measurements. retrieved March 22, 2020 at about 7:00 AM EST. ==Overview== Until the New Kingdom the hekat was one tenth of a khar, later one sixteenth; while the New Kingdom oipe (transcribed ip.t) contained 4 hekat. It was sub-divided into other units - some for medical prescriptions - the hin (1/10), dja (1/64) and ro (1/320). The dja was recently evaluated by Tanja Pommerening in 2002 to 1/64 of a hekat (75 cc) in the MK, and 1/64 of an oipe (1/16 of a hekat, or 300 cc) in the NK, meaning that the dja was denoted by Horus-Eye imagery. It has been suggested by Pommerening that the NK change came about related to the oipe replacing the hekat as the Pharaonic volume control unit in official lists. Hana Vymazalova evaluated the hekat unit in 2002 within the Akhmim Wooden Tablet by showing that five answers were returned to (64/64) when multiplied by the divisors 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. The RMP also divided a hekat unity (64/64) by prime and composite numbers n when 1/64 < n < 64\\\\. The binary quotient used Eye of Horus numbers. The remainder scaled Egyptian fractions to 1/320 units named ro. Quotients and unscaled remainders were obtained for the dja, ro and other units when the divisor n was greater than 64. For example, one the 1/320 ro unit was written by Ahmes by solving 320/n ro. Gillings cites 29 examples of two-part statements converted to one-part statements in RMP 82. Ahmes recorded the n = 3 case by showing (64/64)/3 = 21/64 + 1/192 (a modern statement) as written as(16 + 4 + 1)/64 + 5/3 √ó 1/320 = 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1 2/3ro (two- part ancient statement). Two-part statements were also converted by Ahmes to an unscaled hin unit by writing 3 1/3 hin. The hekat measurement unit, and its double entry accounting system, was found beyond the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. Another text was the Ebers Papyrus, the best known medical text. The hekat unit was defined, in terms of its volume size, in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus by MMP #10, by approximating œÄ to around 3.16. The approximation of œÄ was achieved by squaring a circle, increasingly (i.e. for the denominator in terms of setats: 9, 18, 36, 72, and 81, Gillings, page 141) until the vulgar fraction 256/81 was reached, the only relationship that was used in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. The MMP scribe found the surface area of a basket equal to: (8d/9)2 = 64d2/81, within a cylinder relationship to the hekat. MMP 10 data meant that d = 2 defined œÄ for use in hekat volumes as 256/81. The 256/81 approximation was also used by Ahmes and other scribes. The ancient Egyptian units of measurement discussion further shows that the hekat was 1/30 of a royal cubit3, an analysis that needs to double checked, against the d = 2 suggestion, which means that r = 1, a suggestion that does make sense. One royal cubit of the ancient Egyptian weights and measures = 523.5 millimeters. ((523.5 mm)3) / 30 = 4.78221176 liters. However that may be at least a sphere that has a circumference 523.5 millimeters will actually have a metric volume about 2.42269 liters or roughly half of a hekat or about one sixtieth of a royal cubic cubit to two parts in a hundred. A modern schoolbook formula has volume=4/3 pi r3 for example. In the case of a land where pi=256/81 or about 3.1604938 a similar result can be obtained with the different formula that has been suggested by Zapassky and others where over there the volume of a sphere is given by the quotient of the cube of the circumference divided by six pi2 (V=c3/6œÄ2)Zapassky E, Gadot Y, Finkelstein I, Benenson I (2012) An Ancient Relation between Units of Length and Volume Based on a Sphere.

He was educated at a private school and then entered a business house at Manchester. He went to London and in 1842 emigrated to Australia. He at first had a small property on the northern outskirts of Melbourne but in 1844, in partnership with James S. Johnston, took up a cattle station near Dandenong, Victoria. About the year 1847 he bought The Argus from William Kerr, incorporated with it The Patriot, and five years later absorbed another journal, The Daily News. In the early days of the gold-rush the paper was produced under great difficulties, but the circulation kept increasing, and it became a valuable property. Wilson strenuously opposed the influx of convicts from Tasmania, fought for the separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales, and opposed Governor Charles Hotham in his attitude to the miners; but when the rebellion broke out he took the stand that there were peaceable and legitimate methods of obtaining redress. When Charles Gavan Duffy came to Victoria and went into politics Wilson sent him a list of suggested reforms which included justice to the Aborigines, the organizing of agriculture as a department of the state, the introduction of the ballot into municipal elections, and the leasing of crown lands for cultivation with the right of ultimate purchase. He was the first to raise the cry \\"unlock the lands\\". He was in fact a thorough democrat in sentiment, and an ardent reformer. Costs of running the Argus had increased and Wilson was close to ruin, but was saved when Lauchlan Mackinnon bought a partnership from James Gill, and took over management. In 1857 finding he was losing his eyesight Wilson paid a long visit to England, but in 1858-9 travelled through Australia and New Zealand and wrote a series of sketches for The Argus, published in London in 1859 under the title, Rambles in the Antipodes, with two maps and 12 illustrations by Samuel Thomas Gill. He took much interest in acclimatization, founded the Acclimatization Society in Melbourne in 1861, and was its first president. In the same year he visited Sydney and started the Acclimatization Society of New South Wales. Wilson finally settled in 1864 at Hayes near Bromley in Kent, and lived at Hayes Place the life of an English country gentleman farming 300 acres.1871 England census; RG10 875 folio 50 He occasionally contributed to The Times and the Fortnightly Review; an article from this journal, Principles of Representation, was published as a pamphlet in 1866. Another pamphlet, on Acclimatization, was printed in 1875. He died at Hayes on 10 January 1878 and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery on 7 July. The bulk of his estate was used to form the Edward Wilson Trust which since his death has distributed several million dollars to Victorian charities, in particular the Melbourne, Alfred and Children's hospitals in Victoria. ==References== * * Category:1813 births Category:1878 deaths Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian philanthropists Category:Burials in Victoria (Australia) Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:19th-century male writers Category:19th- century philanthropists ","title":"Edward Wilson (journalist)"},{"id":"9098321","text":"KSNB may refer to: * KSNB (FM), a radio station (91.5 FM) licensed to Norton, Kansas, United States * KSNB-TV, a television station (channel 4) licensed to Superior, Nebraska, United States * KTNF, a radio station (950 AM) licensed to St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States, which used the call sign KSNB from January 2004 to November 2004 ","title":"KSNB"},{"id":"9098325","text":" Thunderbird was a high mission tally Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress of the 303rd Bombardment Group during World War II.

It is now represented by a mural in the WWII gallery of the National Air & Space Museum on the Mall in Washington, DC. The name also appears on a later B-17G. That restoration and replica of Thunderbird is one of the few surviving flyable B-17s, and is the largest aircraft housed at the Lone Star Flight Museum, in Houston, Texas. The demonstration aircraft was completed on May 8, 1945, at the end of hostilities in the European theater of World War II.Lone Star Flight Museum commemorative reference plaque. She was originally B-17G-105-VE 44-85718 and is now painted to replicate a noted veteran WWII bomber of the 359th Bomb Squadron, 303rd Bomb Group, part of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, based at RAF Molesworth, England. ==Thunderbird's history== The largest aircraft owned and operated by the Lone Star Flight Museum is a Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress, christened Thunderbird. At the Wings Over Houston air show, October 2011 The aircraft represented was also a B-17G, serial number 42-38050. She was a B-17G-25-DL manufactured by Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California, and flew 112 combat missions with the 303rd Bomb Group. She was accepted by the USAAF in November 1943 and arrived in the group on January 18, 1944, at RAF Molesworth, England. On January 23, 1944, she was assigned to the crew of 1st Lt. Vern L. Moncur, of Rupert, Idaho and Bountiful, Utah, which had six previous missions in other bombers. After that crew completed her tour on April 10, she was used as a ‚Äúnew crew‚Äù aircraft, used to break in replacement crews, although eight of the missions were flown by the crew of 1st Lt. Richard K. Marsh between April 11 and June 2. She flew her first mission on January 29, 1944 (Frankfurt, Germany), and her last on March 22, 1945 (Gelsenkirchen, Germany), after which she was retired as \\"war weary\\". Returned to the United States after the war, she was sent to Kingman, Arizona, where unlike her LSFM counterpart, she was scrapped. She reputedly was crewed by 538 different airmen, none of whom suffered an injury aboard Thunderbird. The original Thunderbird is the subject of a 25-by-75-foot mural in the World War II Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum on the National Mall entitled \\"Fortresses Under Fire\\", completed 1975‚Äì1976. The artist, Keith Ferris, depicted Thunderbird on her 70th mission at 11:45 a.m., August 15, 1944, over Trier, Germany, on her return to Molesworth following a mission to bomb Wiesbaden, and is historically accurate in the encounter portrayed. Ferris used Thunderbird as the centerpiece of two other paintings, \\"Retirement Party for Old Thunderbird\\" (1965 for the Air Force Art Collection), showing the bomber on her 112th and last mission, and \\"Schweinfurt Again\\", depicting the bomber on her 76th mission in October 1944.

Bissano Ram Gopal OBE (20 November 1912His passport gives his year of birth as 1917, but his contemporaries insisted it must have been closer to 1912 ‚Äì ‚Äì 12 October 2003) was an Indian dancer and choreographer who performed mostly as a soloist and toured extensively throughout his lengthy career. A modernist, he blended the classical Indian dance with balletic choreography, and along with Uday Shankar was among the first to showcase Indian classical dance in the West starting in the 1930s, Polish critic Tadeusz Zelenski called him \\"the Nijinsky of India\\". As a choreographer, he is most known for his productions, Legend of the Taj Mahal, Dance of the Setting Sun and Dances of India. He is also noted for \\"Radha-Krishna\\", his collaboration with BritishMarkova her life and art by Anton Dolin W.H. Allen london 1955 ballerina Dame Alicia Markova, in 1960. ==Early life and training== Gopal was born in Bangalore, India. He was named Bissano, being born on 20 November ( Bees = 20 in Hindi ). He had a Burmese mother and a Rajput father who was a barrister. They lived in a mansion called Torquay Castle. His grandmother was a well known dancer. Drawn to dance early on in his life, he learned Kathakali from Guru Kunju Kurup and Chandu Panickar. Once he danced at the annual garden party of the Maharajah of Mysore without his father's permission, but the Maharaja persuaded his father to allow him receive further dance training. While in this early forties, he discovered Guru Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai of Pandanallur style under whom he started learning Bharatanatyam, followed by Muthukumaran Pillai; he also learned Kathak from Sohanlal and Bowri Prasad and even Manipuri dance, all of which he assimilated into his choreographies in the coming decades. ==Career== He was invited to the United States by La Meri, an American dancer who specialised in non-Western forms of dance to tour with her through Asia in the 1930s. He made his solo debut in New York City on 1 May 1938, at the 46th Street Theatre. In 1939, he was invited to Paris, where he went with Kathak dancer, Sohanlal. and in the same year he made his London debut at the Aldwych Theatre to immediate fame and went on to meet not just Queen Mary, but also made friends with leading figures of the ballet. He returned to India with Ensa during the World War II. After the War, he returned and noted dancer, Nijinsky came to \\"inspect him\\" in 1948. He toured extensively as a soloist and with his company both before and after World War II, and soon his production were known for their costumes, staging and lighting. He appeared at the New York Golden Anniversary International Dance Festival at NYC's City Center in 1948 where he represented India, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires in 1954 and Edinburgh Festivals in 1956. He collaborated with ballerina Dame Alicia Markova to create a duet \\"Radha-Krishna\\" in 1960, based on Hindu mythology, in which she danced as Radha, while he danced as Krishna. Today their collaboration is commemorated at the National Portrait Gallery, London where her bronze bust stands next to his full-length portrait by Feliks Topolski.Ram Gopal Britannica.com. In the later years, he also danced with Mrinalini Sarabhai in Bangalore, and toured with Kumudini Lakhia. Another successful dance partnership was with the young and talented Tara Chaudhri whom Ram was very fond of. Dance critic, Cyril Beaumont editor of \\"Dance Journal\\", wrote about his dancing, \\"what impresses one most about Ram Gopal's dancing is the manner in which he is able to assimilate the characteristics of the four schools of technique so completely different in style, costume and mood.\\" He also danced in the Mumbai school run by the Austrian expressionist dancer Hilde Holger, with whom he remained friends and collaborated with her in their experimental dance style pieces. In Kay Ambrose book published in 1950, \\"Classical Dances and Costumes of India,\\" the book is introduced by Ram Gopal, with foreword by Arnold Haskell containing 53 Illustrations from Photographs and many Drawings by the Author. In this introduction is included a letter Ram Gopal wrote Kay Ambrose from Bangalore, his birthplace in February 1942. The book has many photo's and illustration of Ram Gopal performing these classical dances. He published Indian Dancing in 1951, and his autobiography Rhythms in the Heavens in 1957; he also opened two dance schools for a short while, first in Bangalore before moving to England and later \\"Academy of Indian Dance and Music\\" in London in 1962. In his later years he lived in London, Venice and the South of France. The French filmmaker Claude Lamorisse made two films about him: \\"Aum Shiva\\" and \\"Ram\\".BFI  Film & TV Database  AUM SHIVA (1970) Gopal featured in the Indian-born British documentary filmmaker Sarah Erulkar's short Lord Siva Danced (1947). He received an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to dance in 1999, and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama in 1990. ==Personal life== During the 1960s, while living in Chelsea, London he was briefly married to Edith Alexander, though the marriage ended only a few years later, with her death.

After a single term as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament, he went on to have several notable public appointments. ==Early career== Rees was born in Swansea, and went to Parc Wern School and Glanmor School in Swansea before moving to Bromsgrove School. He trained as a chartered surveyor, and also became a Fellow of the Chartered Auctioneers and Estate Agents' Institute. He became involved in politics early in his life, and was Chairman of Glamorgan Young Conservative group council from 1954 to 1956 and then of Wales and Monmouthshire Young Conservative area council from 1956 to 1958. ==Parliament== At the 1959 general election, Rees won the Swansea West constituency as a Conservative, gaining the seat from Labour by a majority of 403 votes.

He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Keith Joseph from the end of May 1961. ==Whip's Office== Rees was appointed as an Assistant Government Whip in April 1962, effectively silencing him in the chamber. However, he appeared as one of three young Conservative MPs in a party election broadcast at the start of the 1964 general election campaign. Rees was unable to withstand the national swing against the Conservatives, and lost his seat. He could not win it back either at the 1966 or 1970 elections. ==Further appointments== Rees started his own business in Swansea after his defeat.

On an accumulator-based architecture machine, this may be a dedicated register such as SP on an Intel x86 machine. On a general register machine, it may be a register which is reserved by convention, such as on the PDP-11 or RISC machines. Some designs such as the Data General Eclipse had no dedicated register, but used a reserved hardware memory address for this function. Machines before the late 1960s--such as the PDP-8 and HP 2100--did not have compilers which supported recursion. Their subroutine instructions typically would save the current location in the jump address, and then set the program counter to the next address. While this is simpler than maintaining a stack, since there is only one return location per subroutine code section, there cannot be recursion without considerable effort on the part of the programmer. A stack machine has 2 or more stack registers -- one of them keeps track of a call stack, the other(s) keep track of other stack(s). == Stack registers in x86 == In 8086, the main stack register is called stack pointer - SP. The stack segment register (SS) is usually used to store information about the memory segment that stores the call stack of currently executed program. SP points to current stack top. By default, the stack grows downward in memory, so newer values are placed at lower memory addresses. To push a value to the stack, the \`PUSH\` instruction is used. To pop a value from the stack, the \`POP\` instruction is used. Example: Assuming that SS = 1000h and SP = 0xF820. This means that current stack top is the physical address 0x1F820 (this is due to memory segmentation in 8086). The next two machine instructions of the program are: PUSH AX PUSH BX * These first instruction shall push the value stored in AX (16-bit register) to the stack. This is done by subtracting a value of 2 (2 bytes) from SP. * The new value of SP becomes 0xF81E. The CPU then copies the value of AX to the memory word whose physical address is 0x1F81E. * When \\"PUSH BX\\" is executed, SP is set to 0xF81C and BX is copied to 0x1F81C. This illustrates how PUSH works. Usually, the running program pushes registers to the stack to make use of the registers for other purposes, like to call a routine that may change the current values of registers. To restore the values stored at the stack, the program shall contain machine instructions like this: POP BX POP AX * \`POP BX\` copies the word at 0x1F81C (which is the old value of BX) to BX, then increases SP by 2. SP now is 0xF81E. * \`POP AX\` copies the word at 0x1F81E to AX, then sets SP to 0xF820. == Stack engine == Simpler processors store the stack pointer in a regular hardware register and use the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to manipulate its value. Typically push and pop are translated into multiple micro-ops, to separately add/subtract the stack pointer, and perform the load/store in memory. Newer processors contain a dedicated stack engine to optimize stack operations. Pentium M was the first x86 processor to introduce a stack engine. In its implementation, the stack pointer is split among two registers: ESPO, which is a 32-bit register, and ESPd, an 8-bit delta value that is updated directly by stack operations. PUSH, POP, CALL and RET opcodes operate directly with the ESPd register. If ESPd is near overflow or the ESP register is referenced from other instructions (when ESPd ‚â† 0), a synchronisation micro-op is inserted that updates the ESPO using the ALU and resets ESPd to 0. This design has remained largely unmodified in later Intel processors, although ESPO has been expanded to 64 bits. A stack engine similar to Intel's was also adopted in the AMD K8 microarchitecture. In Bulldozer, the need for synchronization micro-ops was removed, but the internal design of the stack engine is not known. == Notes == == References == Category:Control flow Category:Central processing unit Category:Digital registers ","title":"Stack register"},{"id":"9098608","text":"Father Everett Francis Briggs (January 27, 1908 - December 20, 2006) was a Catholic priest and miners' activist. ==Early life== Born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Briggs attended St. Patrick's School there and the Maryknoll Seminary. He graduated from Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Maryknoll Major Seminary in Maryknoll, New York. In 1933 he was ordained to the priesthood and assigned to Otsu, Japan, as a missionary. ==War time service== In 1941, during World War II, he was arrested as a spy and protested by going on a hunger strike. He spent about a year in an internment camp in Japan. In 1943, after his repatriation, when American and Japanese nationals were exchanged, he taught Japanese, then spent six years assigned to the camps in which the United States interned its Japanese citizens. ==Career== In 1956, a few days before Christmas, he arrived in Monongah, West Virginia, where he became interested in the history of the Monongah Mining Disaster of December 6, 1907. In the accident, described as \\"the worst mining disaster in American History\\", at least 360 miners died; the vast majority of them were Italian Americans. After discovering there was no memorial, he sought to ensure that the victims of the tragedy were not forgotten. He wrote an article, based on his studies, suggesting that there were more than 361 victims of the Monongah Mining Disaster, and that the true number would be upward of 500.Everett F. Briggs, Mine disaster, Science, vol. 146, October 2, 1964. In 1957 Briggs engaged himself in organizing the 50-year anniversary of the explosion. In 1961 he founded Saint Barbara's Memorial Nursing Home (Saint Barbara is the patron saint of miners) in Monongah, as a mining memorial to recognize the Monongah coal miners and all miners who died in mining disasters. He headed the committee that erected a statue At the Heroine of Monongah as a tribute to the widows of the 1907 mining accident and to coal miners‚Äô widows everywhere. The statue is made of Carrara marble and is located near the Town Hall in Monongah. West Virginia dedicated the bridge that traverses the West Fork River in Marion County in his honor, and named it Father Everett Francis Briggs Bridge.The Legislature of West Virginia, House Concurrent Resolution no. 40, February 21, 2002.

The term comes from romero/romeiro, meaning a person travelling to Rome. The travelling can be done in cars, floats, on horseback or on foot, and its destination is a sanctuary or hermitage consecrated to a religious figure honored in that day's feast. Besides attending religious services and processions, the pilgrims may also engage in social events like singing, feasting and dancing. ==Background== One of the most famous examples of a pilgrimage is that of Nuestra Se√±ora del Roc√≠o, in which the faithful move to the Sanctuary of the Virgen del Roc√≠o in the village of the Roc√≠o, in Almonte, Huelva. The Romeria of Sant John of the Mountain, celebrated in Miranda de Ebro, is the second most important romeria in Spain behind El Roc√≠o with more than 25,000 romeros. Another one of the most representative examples is the Romer√≠a de la Virgen de la Cabeza (And√∫jar, Ja√©n), which is considered the oldest pilgrimages of Spain, and consists of the displacement of the travellers coming from all over the country to the Sanctuary of the Virgen de la Cabeza, through 33 km of And√∫jar, in the heart of Sierra de Andujar natural park. This celebration is held the last Sunday of April and is considered of national tourist interest. The Romer√≠a de la Virgin de Navahonda, celebrated in spring in the Madrilenian municipality of Robledo de Chavela is representative of this tradition. There are also pilgrimages in the Canary Islands. An example is La Romer√≠a de Santiago Apostol, in G√°ldar. Instead of focusing on Jesus, the floats usually praise the Virgin Mary with pictures and statues. ==The New World== Neo- classical Guadalajara Cathedral In Mexico, pilgrims walk to the Our Lady of Zapopan, which this considered the third most important peregrination in the country, after the one of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and the Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos. The Pilgrimage of the Virgin of Zapopan consists of a route 8 km in length, from the Guadalajara Cathedral to the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan. It is made every 12 October, and figure of the virgin goes accompanied by more than 3,000,000 people. In Costa Rica, it is traditional to make a pilgrimage to Cartago on 2 August to make requests and give thanks to the Virgen de los √Ångeles (the Lady of the Angels), nicknamed la Negrita due to the dark green color of the statue representing her; the statue located inside the Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels. People all over the country and even other Central American countries participate on foot or horseback.

It allows a to increase the output power and brightness of single-transversal mode laser. Usually, the term coherent addition applies to fiber lasers. As the ability of pumping and/or cooling of a single laser is saturated, several similar lasers can be forced to oscillate in phase with common coupler. The coherent addition was demonstrated in power scaling of Raman lasers.A. Shirakawa, T. Saitou, T. Sekiguchi and K. Ueda: \\"Coherent addition of fiber lasers by use of a fiber coupler\\" Optics Express 10 (2002) 1167‚Äì1172 Fig.1. Example of the coherent addition of 4 fiber lasers with a common coupler. == Limits of coherent addition == The addition of lasers reduces the number of longitudinal modes in the output beam; the more lasers are combined, the smaller is the number of longitudinal modes in the output. The simple estimates show that the number of output modes reduces exponentially with number of lasers combined. Of order of eight lasers can be combined in such a way.D. Kouznetsov, J.F. Bisson. A. Shirakawa, K.Ueda \\"Limits of Coherent Addition of Lasers: Simple Estimate \\" Optical Review Vol. 12, No. 6, 445‚Äì447 (2005). (Also .) The future increase of number of combined lasers requires the exponential growth of the spectral bandwidth of gain and/or length of partial lasers. The same conclusion can be made also on the base of more detailed simulations. A.E.Siegman. Resonant modes of linearly coupled multiple fiber laser structures. Preprint of the Stanford University, 2005, 25 pages; http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/coupled_fiber_modes.pdf Practically, the combination of more than ten lasers with a passive combining arrangement appears to be difficult. However, active coherent combining of lasers has the potential to scale to very large numbers of channels.Leo A. Siiman, Wei-zung Chang, Tong Zhou, and Almantas Galvanauskas, \\"Coherent femtosecond pulse combining of multiple parallel chirped pulse fiber amplifiers\\" Optics Express 20 (2012) 18097-18116 == Nonlinear coherent addition of lasers == Nonlinear interactions of light waves are used widely to synchronize the laser beams in multichannel optical systems. Self-adjusting of phases may be robustly achievable in binary-tree array of beam-splitters and degenerate four-wave mixing Kerr Phase conjugation in Chirped pulse amplification extreme light facilities. This phase-conjugating Michelson interferometer increases the brightness as N^2, where N is the number of phase-locked channels. == Talbot coherent addition == Constructive interference due to Talbot self-imaging forces the lasers in the array to transverse mode lock. The Fresnel number F of the one-dimensional N- element laser array phase-locked by Talbot cavity is given by F=N^2. For the two- dimensional N^2- element laser array phase-locked by Talbot cavity Fresnel number F scales as F=N^2 as well.

The station joined the network in March 2008, and is currently (as of May 2020) the newest station on the network. The station was constructed at a cost of ¬£3.2 million, with original plans to open in January 2007. However, delays in planning and construction meant that the station opened later than planned, in March 2008, replacing Northumberland Park (which opened in December 2005) as the newest station on the network. The decision to construct a station here was controversial, with the decision not universally welcomed by all local residents. There were concerns that the station's opening would lead to an increase in both crime and local road traffic. Simonside was used by 169,688 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the seventh- least-used station on the network. == Facilities == Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramps providing step-free access to both platforms at Simonside. The station is equipped with ticket machines, waiting shelter, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network. There is no dedicated car parking available at the station. There is the provision for cycle parking, with 2 cycle pods available for use. == Service and frequency== Simonside is served by the Yellow Line, which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes. Services from platform 1 operate towards South Shields, with the first train departing at 05:31 (05:38 on Saturday and 06:53 on Sunday). Services from platform 2 operate towards St. James via Whitley Bay, with the first train departing at 05:50 (05:54 on Saturday and 07:09 on Sunday). Trains run frequently across the network, at intervals of up to every 12 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime), and every 15 minutes (evening and Sunday), with the last trains departing at around midnight.

Jellinek) from about the 10th century, and which is devoted entirely to the Shavuot holiday; a Vatican library manuscript in fact calls it \\"an aggadah for Shavuot.\\" == Goals of the Midrash == The author of the Midrash seeks to inculcate the doctrines of the Ten Commandments by citing pertinent tales of a moral and religious nature. In addition to much material from unknown sources, he employs many passages from treatises on the Creation, revelation, and similar topics, which he introduces with the phrase \\"ameru hakhamim\\" (the sages say); he seldom cites his authorities. He writes in a lucid Hebrew style. The separate commandments are prefaced by a general introduction based on Psalms 106:2: \\"Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all his praise?\\" This verse is explained, with reference to Pirkei De- Rabbi Eliezer 3, as follows: \\"Even the angels are unable to recount His mighty acts; only faintly may be shown what He has created and what shall come to pass, that the name of the King of all kings, the Holy One, blessed be He!, may be praised and honored.\\" ==Sample of Contents== After a few sentences follows the aggadah of the strife of the letters, which contended with each other for the honor of forming the beginning of creation. The victor in this contest was the letter \\"bet,\\" the initial of the word ◊ë◊®◊ê◊©◊ô◊™, while \\"alef\\" was comforted by the promise that with it, as the first letter of ◊ê◊†◊õ◊ô, the revelation of the Ten Commandments should begin.Compare the recension of the Midrash of the Alphabet in A. Jellinek, B. H. iii. 50 et seq.; Genesis Rabbah 1, ed.

The introduction then makes excursus on the modesty of Moses, which gained for him the honor of God's revelation of the Torah; on the preexistence of the Torah, and on God's invitation to the Gentiles to accept it, which they all refused; and on the pledges which God required of Israel to keep the Torah, these pledges being their children.Compare Shir haShirim Rabbah to Shir haShirim 1:3 In the discussion of the several commandments (◊ì◊ô◊ë◊ï◊® ◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊ü, etc., to ◊ì◊ô◊ë◊ï◊® ◊™◊©◊ô◊¢◊ô, which are included in the editions of this midrash) only the first and sixth commandments, which have no story attached to them, are treated at any length in aggadic fashion. In the case of the other commandments, legends form the principal part of the discussion, and are arranged as follows: * commandment 2, the mother and her seven children, the limping Jew; * commandment 3, one who never swore; * commandment 4, the pious man and the cow; Joseph, who kept holy the Sabbath-day, the emperor and R. Joshua b. Hananiah, Tinnius Rufus and Rabbi Akiva * commandment 5, three examples of the love of children, the child and the Book of Genesis * commandment 7, the temptation of Mattithiah b. ·∏§eresh, Rabbi Meir and the wife of his host, Mattaniah's wife and death; the history of Saul, who by the help of Elijah was reunited with his wife after a long separation * commandment 8, Solomon and the thief, the merchant and the thievish innkeeper; * commandment 9, the son of the publican Baya. ==References Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === *Zunz, G.

Note that this diagram uses non-standard dental notation. Dental anatomy is a field of anatomy dedicated to the study of human tooth structures. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its purview. (The function of teeth as they contact one another falls elsewhere, under dental occlusion.) Tooth formation begins before birth, and the teeth's eventual morphology is dictated during this time. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomical science: it is concerned with the naming of teeth and the structures of which they are made, this information serving a practical purpose in dental treatment. Usually, there are 20 primary (\\"baby\\") teeth and 32 permanent teeth, the last four being third molars or \\"wisdom teeth\\", each of which may or may not grow in. Among primary teeth, 10 usually are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and the other 10 in the mandible (lower jaw). Among permanent teeth, 16 are found in the maxilla and the other 16 in the mandible. Most of the teeth have distinguishing features. == Growing of tooth == Radiograph of lower right (from left to right) third, second, and first molars in different stages of development. Panoramic x-ray radiography of the teeth of a 64-year-old male. Dental work performed mostly in UK/Europe in last half of 20th Century Tooth development is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, non-human tooth development is largely the same as in humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary (baby) teeth start to form between the sixth and eighth weeks in utero, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week in utero.A. R. Ten Cate, Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function, 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 95. . If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all. A significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first branchial arch that is necessary for the development of teeth. The tooth bud (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth and is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The enamel organ is composed of the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines the root shape of the tooth. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells.*University of Texas Medical Branch. \\"Lab Exercises: Tooth development.\\" Page found here . Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth.A. R. Ten Cate, Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function, 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby- Year Book, 1998), pp. 86 and 102. . The dental follicle gives rise to three important entities: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.*Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina. Histology: a text and atlas. 4th edition, p. 453. 2003. . Tooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.A. R. Ten Cate, Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function, 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 81. . This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages. == Identification  Nomenclature === Teeth are named by their sets and also arch, class, type, and side. Teeth can belong to one of two sets of teeth: primary (\\"baby\\") teeth or permanent teeth. Often, \\"deciduous\\" may be used in place of \\"primary\\", and \\"adult\\" may be used for \\"permanent\\". \\"Succedaneous\\" refers to those teeth of the permanent dentition that replace primary teeth (incisors, canines, and premolars of the permanent dentition). Succedaneous would refer to these teeth as a group. Further, the name depends upon which arch the tooth is found in. The term, \\"maxillary\\", is given to teeth in the upper jaw and \\"mandibular\\" to those in the lower jaw. There are four classes of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Premolars are found only in permanent teeth; there are no premolars in deciduous teeth. Within each class, teeth may be classified into different traits. Incisors are divided further into central and lateral incisors. Among premolars and molars, there are first and second premolars, and first, second, and third molars. The side of the mouth in which a tooth is found may also be included in the name. For example, a specific name for a tooth may be \\"permanent maxillary left lateral incisor.\\" === Numbering systems === There are several different dental notation systems for associating information to a specific tooth. The three most commons systems are the FDI World Dental Federation notation, Universal numbering system (dental), and Palmer notation method. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States. Although the Palmer notation was supposedly superseded by the FDI World Dental Federation notation, it overwhelmingly continues to be the preferred method used by dental students and practitioners in the United Kingdom. It was originally termed the \\"Zsigmondy system\\" after the Austrian dentist Adolf Zsigmondy who developed the idea in 1861, using a Zsigmondy cross to record quadrants of tooth positions. The Palmer notation consists of a symbol (‚îò‚îî ‚îê‚îå) designating in which quadrant the tooth is found (from the dentist's perceptive) and a number indicating the position from the midline. Permanent teeth are numbered 1 to 8, and primary teeth are indicated by a letter A to E. The universal numbering system uses a unique letter or number for each tooth. The uppercase letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated \\"1\\" is the right maxillary third molar and the count continues along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the left mandibular third molar, designated number 17, and continues along the bottom teeth to the right side. The FDI system uses a two-digit numbering system in which the first number represents a tooth's quadrant and the second number represents the number of the tooth from the midline of the face. For permanent teeth, the upper right teeth begin with the number, \\"1\\". The upper left teeth begin with the number, \\"2\\". The lower left teeth begin with the number, \\"3\\". The lower right teeth begin with the number, \\"4\\". For primary teeth, the sequence of numbers goes 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the teeth in the upper right, upper left, lower left, and lower right respectively. As a result, any given tooth has three different ways to identify it, depending on which notation system is used. The permanent right maxillary central incisor is identified by the number \\"8\\" in the universal system. In the FDI system, the same tooth is identified by the number \\"11\\". The palmer system uses the number and symbol, 1‚îò, to identify the tooth. Further confusion may result if a number is given on a tooth without assuming (or specifying) a common notation method. Since the number, \\"12\\", may signify the permanent left maxillary first premolar in the universal system or the permanent right maxillary lateral incisor in the FDI system, the notation being used must be clear to prevent confusion. In 1891 Victor Haderup devised a variant of eight tooth quadrant system in which plus (+) and minus (-) were used to differentiate between upper and lower quadrants, and between right and left quadrants (e.g., +1 = upper right central incisor; 1- = lower left central incisor). Primary teeth were numbered as upper right (05+ to 01+), lower left (-01 to -05). This system is still used in Denmark. == Anatomic landmarks  Crown and root === gingival tissue and alveolar bone (C) by fibrous attachments. The gingival fibers (H) run from the cementum (B) into the gingiva immediately apical to the junctional epithelial attachment and the periodontal ligament fibers (I), (J) and (K) run from the cementum into the adjacent cortex of the alveolar bone. The term \\"crown\\" of a tooth can be used in two ways. The term \\"anatomic crown\\" of a tooth refers to the area above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or \\"neck\\" of the tooth. It is completely covered in enamel. The term \\"clinical crown\\" often is convenient in referring to any part of the tooth visible in the mouth, but as a rule the unqualified term \\"crown\\" refers to the anatomic crown. The bulk of the crown is composed of dentine, with the pulp chamber within. The crown is enclosed within bone before the tooth erupts, but after eruption the crown is almost always visible in an anatomically normal and clinically healthy mouth. The anatomic root is found below the cementoenamel junction and is covered with cementum, whereas the clinical root is any part of a tooth not visible in the mouth. Similarly, the anatomic root is assumed in most circumstances. Dentin composes most of the root, which normally has pulp canals. The roots of teeth may be single in number (single-rooted teeth) or multiple. Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. The tooth is supported in bone by an attachment apparatus, known as the periodontium, which interacts with the root. === Surfaces === Surfaces that are nearest the cheeks or lips are referred to as either buccal (when found on posterior teeth nearest the cheeks) or labial (when found on anterior teeth nearest the lips). Those nearest the tongue are known as lingual. Lingual surfaces can also be described as palatal when found on maxillary teeth beside the hard palate. Surfaces that aid in chewing are known as occlusal on posterior teeth and incisal on anterior teeth. Surfaces nearest the junction of the crown and root are referred to as cervical, and those closest to the apex of the root are referred to as apical. The tissue surrounding apex is called periapical. Mesial signifies a surface closer to the median line of the face, which is located on a vertical axis between the eyes, down the nose, and between the contact of the central incisors. Surfaces further away from the median line are described as distal. === Cusp === A cusp is an elevation on an occlusal surface of posterior teeth and canines. It contributes to a significant portion of the tooth's surface. Canines have one cusp. Maxillary premolars and the mandibular first premolars usually have two cusps. Mandibular second premolars frequently have three cusps--- one buccal and two lingual. Maxillary molars have two buccal cusps and two lingual cusps. A fifth cusp that may form on the maxillary first molar is known as the cusp of Carabelli. Mandibular molars may have five or four cusps. === Cingulum === A cingulum is a convexity mesiodistally resembling a girdle, encircling the lingual surface at the cervical third, found on the lingual surface of anterior teeth. It is frequently identifiable as an inverted V-shaped ridge,Gray, Henry. XI. Splanchnology. 2a. The Mouth, from \\"Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body\\". 20th U.S. edition. 1918. and its appearance is comparable to a girdle.Johnson, Clarke. \\"Biology of the Human Dentition \\", 1998. Page accessed on January 24, 2007. All anterior teeth are formed from four centers of development, referred to as lobes. Three are located on the facial side of the tooth, and one on the lingual side. The cingulum forms from this lingual lobe of development.Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. Wheeler‚Äôs Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion. 8th edition. 2003. p. 105. . The majority of a lingual surface's cervical third is made up of the cingulum. On lower incisors, a cingulum usually is poorly developed or absent. Maxillary canines have a large, well- developed cingulum,Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. Wheeler‚Äôs Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion. 8th edition. 2003. p. 198. . whereas the cingulum of mandibular canines is smoother and rounded.\\"Maxillary and Mandibular Canines \\", hosted on the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry website. Page accessed May 13, 2007. === Ridges === Ridges are any linear, flat elevations on teeth,Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. Wheeler‚Äôs Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion. 8th edition. 2003. p. 11. . and they are named according to their location. The buccal ridge runs cervico-occlusally in approximately the center of the buccal surface of premolars. The labial ridge is one that runs cervico-incisally in approximately the center of the labial surface of canines. The lingual ridge extends from the cingulum to the cusp tip on the lingual surface of most canines. The cervical ridge runs mesiodistally on the cervical third of the buccal surface of the crown. These are found on all primary teeth but only on the permanent molars. Cusp ridges are ridges that radiate from cusp tips. There are two marginal ridges, mesial and distal, present on all teeth. On anterior teeth, they are located on the mesial and distal borders of the lingual surface; on posterior teeth, they are located on the mesial and distal borders of the occlusal surface. Triangular ridges are those that project from the cusp tips of premolar and molars to the central groove. Transverse ridges are formed by the union of two triangular ridges on posterior teeth. The joining of buccal and lingual triangular ridges is usually named as an example. The oblique ridge is found on the occlusal surfaces of maxillary molars. It is formed by the union of the distal cusp ridge of the mesiolingual cusp and the triangular ridge of the distobuccal cusp. The oblique ridges usually forms the distal boundary of the central fossa. === Developmental groove === The teeth demonstrating the fewest developmental grooves are the mandibular central and lateral incisors.Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. Wheeler‚Äôs Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion. 8th edition. 2003. p. 177. . However, the canines show the most prominent developmental grooves, because they have robust anchorage to the bone. ===Embrasures=== Embrasures are triangularly shaped spaces located between the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth. The borders of embrasures are formed by the interdental papilla of the gingiva, the adjacent teeth, and the contact point where the two teeth meet. There are four embrasures for every contact area: facial (also called labial or buccal), lingual (or palatal), occlusal or incisal, and cervical or interproximal space. The cervical embrasure usually is filled by the interdental papilla from the gingiva; in the absence of adequate gingival tissue a black angle, or Angularis Nigra is visible. Embrasures have three functions. They form spillways between teeth to direct food away from the gingiva. Also, they provide a mechanism for teeth to be more self cleansing. Lastly, they protect the gingiva from undue frictional trauma but also providing the proper degree of stimulation to the tissues. === Mammelons === Mammelons are usually found as three small bumps on the incisal edges of anterior teeth. They are the remnants of three lobes of formation of these teeth, the fourth lobe represented by the cingulum. Since this surface of the tooth is the first to wear away from attrition, mammelons may not be visible on teeth of older people. Instead, the best chance to see this characteristic is soon after eruption of the tooth into the mouth. Note, the presence of mammelons in adults is an indication of malocclusion. == Distinguishing characteristics of teeth  Incisor === Eight incisors are anterior teeth, four in the upper arch and four in the lower. Their function is for shearing or cutting food during chewing. There are no cusps on the teeth. Instead, the surface area of the tooth used in eating is called the incisal ridge or incisal edge. Though similar, there are some minor differences between the primary and permanent incisors.  Maxillary central incisor  A permanent maxillary central incisor The maxillary central incisors are usually the most visible teeth, since they are the top center two teeth in the front of a mouth, and they are located mesial to the maxillary lateral incisor. The overall length of the deciduous maxillary central incisor is 16 mm on average, with the crown being 6 mm and the root being 10 mm.Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. Wheeler‚Äôs Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion. 8th edition. 2003. p. 75. . In comparison to the permanent maxillary central incisor, the ratio of the root length to the crown length is greater in the deciduous tooth. The diameter of the crown mesiodistally is greater than the length cervicoincisally, which makes the tooth appear wider rather than taller from a labial viewpoint. The permanent maxillary central incisor is the widest tooth mesiodistally in comparison to any other anterior tooth. It is larger than the neighboring lateral incisor and is usually not as convex on its labial surface. As a result, the central incisor appears to be more rectangular or square in shape. The mesial incisal angle is sharper than the distal incisal angle. When this tooth is newly erupted into the mouth, the incisal edges have three rounded features called mammelons.The Permanent Incisor Teeth , hosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), accessed on June 8, 2006. Mammelons disappear with time as the enamel wears away by friction.  Maxillary lateral incisor  The maxillary lateral incisor is the tooth located distally from both maxillary central incisors of the mouth and mesially from both maxillary canines.  Mandibular central incisor  The mandibular central incisor is the tooth located on the jaw, adjacent to the midline of the face. It is mesial from both mandibular lateral incisors.  Mandibular lateral incisor  The mandibular lateral incisor is the tooth located distally from both mandibular central incisors of the mouth and mesially from both mandibular canines. === Canine (cuspid) === Both the maxillary and mandibular canines are called the \\"cornerstone\\" of the mouth because they are all located three teeth away from the midline, and separate the premolars from the incisors. The location of the canines reflect their dual function as they complement both the premolars and incisors during chewing. Nonetheless, the most common action of the canines is tearing of food. There is a single cusp on canines, and they resemble the prehensile teeth found in carnivorous animals. Though similar, there are some minor differences.  Maxillary canine  The maxillary canine is the tooth located laterally from both maxillary lateral incisors of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary first premolars. It is the longest tooth in total length, from root to the incisal edge, in the mouth.  Mandibular canine  The mandibular canine is the tooth located distally from both mandibular lateral incisors of the mouth but mesially from both mandibular first premolars. === Premolar (bicuspid) === Premolars are found distal to canines and mesial to molars. They are divided into first and second premolars. The functions of premolars vary. There are no deciduous premolars. Instead, the teeth that precede the permanent premolars are the deciduous molars.  Maxillary first premolar  The maxillary first premolar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary canines of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary second premolars. The function of this premolar is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during chewing. There are two cusps on maxillary first premolars, and the buccal cusp is sharp enough to resemble the prehensile teeth found in carnivorous animals. There is a distinctive concavity on the cervical third of the crown extending onto the root.The Premolar Teeth, hosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) website. Page accessed May 16, 2007. The maxillary 1st premolar is also bifurcated with two roots.  Maxillary second premolar  The maxillary second premolar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary first premolars of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary first molars. The function of this premolar is similar to that of first molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during chewing. There are two cusps on maxillary second premolars, but both of them are less sharp than those of the maxillary first premolars.  Mandibular first premolar  The mandibular first premolar is the tooth located laterally from both the mandibular canines of the mouth but mesially from both mandibular second premolars. The function of this premolar is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during mastication. Mandibular first premolars have two cusps. The one large and sharp is located on the buccal side of the tooth. Since the lingual cusp is small and nonfunctional, which means it is not active in chewing, the mandibular first premolar resembles a small canine.  Mandibular second premolar  The mandibular second premolar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular first premolars of the mouth but mesially from both mandibular first molars. The function of this premolar is to assist the mandibular first molar during mastication. Mandibular second premolars have three cusps. There is one large cusp on the buccal side of the tooth. The lingual cusps are well developed and functional, which means the cusps assist during chewing. Therefore, whereas the mandibular first premolar resembles a small canine, the mandibular second premolar is more like the first molar. === Molar === Molars are the most posterior teeth in the mouth. Their function is to grind food during chewing. The number of cusps, and thus the overall appearance, vary among the different molars and between people. There are great differences between the deciduous molars and those of the permanent molars, even though their functions are similar. Permanent maxillary molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede them. Despite being named \\"molars\\", the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. The third molars are commonly called \\"wisdom teeth.\\"  Maxillary first molar  The maxillary first molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary second premolars of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary second molars. There are usually four cusps on maxillary molars, two on the buccal and two palatal. Most times there is also a fifth cusp, called the Cusp of Carabelli, located on the mesiolingual aspect of the tooth.  Maxillary second molar  The maxillary second molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary first molars of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary third molars. This is true only in permanent teeth. In deciduous teeth, the maxillary second molar is the last tooth in the mouth and does not have a third molar behind it. The deciduous maxillary second molar is also the most likely of the deciduous teeth to have an oblique ridge. There are usually four cusps on maxillary molars, two buccal and two palatal.  Maxillary third molar  The maxillary third molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary second molars of the mouth with no tooth posterior to it in permanent teeth. In deciduous teeth, there is no maxillary third molar. There are usually four cusps on maxillary molars, two buccal and two palatal. Nonetheless, for this tooth, there are great variances among third molars, and a specific description of a third molar will not hold true in all cases.  Mandibular first molar  The mandibular first molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesially from both mandibular second molars. It is located on the mandibular arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar. This arrangement is known as Class I occlusion. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal, two lingual, and one distal.  Mandibular second molar  The mandibular second molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular first molars of the mouth but mesially from both mandibular third molars. This is true only in permanent teeth. In deciduous teeth, the mandibular second molar is the last tooth in the mouth and does not have a third molar behind it. Though there is more variation between individuals to that of the first mandibular molar, there are usually four cusps on mandibular second molars: two buccal and two lingual.  Mandibular third molar  The mandibular third molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular second molars of the mouth with no tooth posterior to it in permanent teeth. In deciduous teeth, there is no mandibular third molar. For this tooth, there are great variances among third molars, and a specific of a third molar will not hold true in all cases. ==References== Category:Human anatomy ","title":"Dental anatomy"},{"id":"9099065","text":"CTV 2 Alberta is a Canadian English language entertainment and former educational television channel in the province of Alberta.

Prior to this point, English-language educational programs aired on Radio-Canada's television station CBXFT in Edmonton. At its launch, Access was only available through cable, and did not broadcast over- the-air. On January 9, 1984, AECC was granted a license from the CRTC for a television station in Calgary, CIAN; on December 1, 1986, AECC was granted another license for a television station in Edmonton, CJAL, to rebroadcast the programs from CIAN. Both stations rebroadcast the Access feed. After re- evaluating all provincial funding recipients, the Government of Alberta announced in 1993 that it would cease to directly fund Access past 1994. As a result, in 1995, Access was privatized and sold to Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Limited (LSTA), which is 60% owned by CHUM Limited. In February 2005, CHUM Limited acquired the remaining 40% interest in LSTA (and renamed it Access Media Group), giving the company 100% of its shares, including its ownership in Access. On July 12, 2006, CTVglobemedia announced that it would make a friendly takeover bid to buy CHUM Limited. Due to CTVglobemedia's plans to keep CTV and Citytv, Rogers Communications was expected to purchase Access (along with CHUM's A-Channel stations, CKX-TV in Brandon, Canadian Learning Television and SexTV: The Channel) as announced on April 9, 2007, pending CRTC approval (and approval of CTVglobemedia's purchase). With the CRTC electing to force CTV to sell the Citytv stations instead, the Rogers deal was rendered void. As such, CTVglobemedia retained Access along with the A-Channel stations, CKX-TV and all of CHUM's specialty channels, and sold the Citytv stations to Rogers. The takeover transaction was finalized on June 22, 2007. The A-Channel stations were rebranded as \\"A\\" on August 11, 2008; on the same date, Access debuted a new A-styled logo and began airing programming from \\"A\\" during certain primetime hours. On June 8, 2011, it was revealed that Access would be relaunched as CTV Two Alberta on August 29, 2011, as part of a rebranding of the \\"A\\" system. On January 11, 2016, during CTV Two Alberta's license renewal, Bell Media (a successor to CTVglobemedia) requested that the channel no longer be classified as an educational broadcaster. The company stated that the province would be better served with both a dedicated educational broadcaster alongside a private service. Despite receiving criticism from a number of groups, most notably from Ontario educational broadcaster TVO, the CRTC approved the request on May 15, 2017, citing the lack of intervention from the provincial government, as well as talks between the government and British Columbia's Knowledge Network to potentially launch a new publicly owned and operated educational broadcast service in Alberta. As a result, CTV Two Alberta dropped all educational programming but continues to air the newsmagazine Alberta Primetime. ==Digital television== As part of Canada's transition to digital terrestrial television, broadcast television stations in Calgary and Edmonton were required to convert to digital broadcasting or sign off completely by August 31, 2011. Prior to this deadline, the station had in place an analog over-the-air television transmitter in each of those two markets. The station did not have any other over-the-air transmitters. As the channel is licensed as a satellite-to-cable undertaking, it is not required to offer over-the-air transmitters. Due to this, the costs of converting the two Access transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton to digital, and because the network already must be carried by cable and IPTV providers in the area as the province's designated educational broadcaster, CTV 2 shut down its over-the-air television transmitters on August 31, 2011. ==Programming== As Access, the network carried a variety of educational and informative programs along with entertainment programs all of which include children's programs, documentaries, feature films, talk shows, dramas, comedies and other programs. Starting March 9, 2009, Access began cabling a province-wide news and current affairs magazine program called Alberta Primetime, from the CTV/Access studios in Edmonton. Resources from CTV's owned-and-operated stations in Edmonton (CFRN-TV) and Calgary (CFCN-TV) will be used to produce the program.Albertaprimetime.com Former logo. Used from 2011-2018. CTV 2 Alberta dropped all children's and educational programming from its schedule (including archival Access Network programming) when it ceased being licensed as an educational broadcaster in 2017. It now airs the full CTV 2 schedule with the exception of the provincial newsmagazine Alberta Primetime. ==See also== *CTV 2 Atlantic - a similar cable-only affiliate of CTV 2 in Atlantic Canada; formerly the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) and A Atlantic *Citytv Saskatchewan - a similar cable-only affiliate of Citytv in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan; formerly Saskatchewan Communications Network *The CW Plus - an alternate feed of The CW Television Network for small and mid-size television markets in the United States, made up of privately owned digital multicast channels and cable-only affiliates, with syndicated programs supplied by the network in addition to CW network programming ==References== ==External links== *CTV 2 Alberta *Canadian Communications Foundation - CJAL-TV History *Canadian Communications Foundation - CIAN-TV History Category:Television stations in Alberta Category:CTV 2 stations Category:Television channels and stations established in 1973 Category:Educational television networks in Canada Category:Former Crown corporations of Canada Category:1973 establishments in Alberta ","title":"CTV 2 Alberta"},{"id":"9099116","text":"Manolo Garc√≠a Manuel Garc√≠a Garc√≠a-P√©rez (*Poblenou, Barcelona, is a Spanish singer and painter.

The assessment of risk is often conservative. The insurer and the insured share in the net profit of the transaction, including loss experience and investment income. The premium is generally well in excess of the present value of a conservative estimate of loss experience. The policy generally contains retrospective rating provisions such as *Commutation provisions, *Additional premium provisions, or *An experience account Finite risk insurance excludes products expressly sold as annuities. The term \\"blended finite risk insurance\\" is often used to describe an insurance product that has the characteristics of finite risk, but with more risk transfer included than generally is the case for finite risk. While there is no bright line test for risk transfer, the distinction would be most readily noted in the premium for blended finite risk insurance, which must be less than the present value of a conserative estimate of loss experience by a readily noticeable degree. ==Important terms== \\"Additional premium provision\\" means, in the context of finite risk insurance, a provision of an insurance or reinsurance contract that requires or strongly encourages the insured to pay the insurer some calculable amount as a result of losses paid or incurred under that insurance or reinsurance contract, excluding provisions for additional premium due to changes in exposure or policy audit. \\"Commutation provision\\" means a verbal or written agreement, whether or not formally incorporated into an insurance or reinsurance policy, that allows the policyholder to commute the policy, usually implying that all liabilities and rights created by that contract are extinguished in return for the balance of an experience account. Generally provisions such as \\"profit sharing\\" or \\"low claims bonus,\\" which also produce a return of premium that can be reduced by claims payments, are not considered Commutation Provisions if they do not extinguish the contract. Loss-based return and additional premium provisions in conventional loss-based rating plans, e.g., incurred loss retrospectively rated insurance and so-called \\"retention plans\\" used commonly in insuring US Workers' Compensation, are generally not considered Commutation Provisions for much the same reason. Sample language for such a provision might resemble this: ===Commutation by policyholder=== > This policy may be commuted by the policyholder (the ‚Äúcommutation‚Äù) > effective as of December 31, 200_ or on each two year anniversary of such > date thereafter, upon not less than ninety (90) days advance written notice > to the Insurer. The date of the Commutation (the \\"Commutation Date\\") shall > be set forth in such notice. Effective the Commutation Date, the > Policyholder and the Insurer, finally and irrevocably release each other > from any and all liability and obligations to each other under or in > connection with this Policy, whether billed or unbilled, whether reported or > unreported and whether known or unknown; provided that, upon the > Commutation, the Insurer shall pay to the Policyholder an amount equal to > the Loss Experience Account. Such Loss Experience Account shall be due and > payable to the Policyholder on the Commutation Date. \\"Experience account\\" when used in the context of finite risk refers to a provision in an insurance or reinsurance contract that, using some function of premium, insurer charges, losses paid or payable under the contract, subrogation proceeds, and interest rates, forms the basis of an explicit or notional fund that can then be used to calculate the amount due under an additional premium provision. An example, appropriate for a finite risk insurance policy, might look like this: ===Loss experience account=== > A notional loss experience account will be created at the Inception Date, > for use in evaluating amounts due under the commutation provision, which > shall be updated annually thereafter as of the last day of each calendar > year so long as this Policy remains in effect. The notional loss experience > account will be determined as follows: > > #Beginning balance; minus #Payments of ultimate net loss made by the > Insurer as of the immediately preceding loss payment date; plus #Interest > income on any positive daily balance calculated using an interest rate equal > to the one-year treasury rate effective on the inception date (for the first > calculation) and effective at each one-year anniversary for each subsequent > twelve-month period. > As of the inception date, the beginning balance will be equal to 100 > percent of the premium, less brokerage fees, less the insurer margin. The > beginning balance for each subsequent year will be the total of (1) through > (3), above, from the prior year's calculation. ==References== Category:Types of insurance ","title":"Finite risk insurance"},{"id":"9099126","text":"Francis Frederick Kean (born 1966) was the Commander of the Fijian Navy when, in 2006, he was charged with murder. He was convicted of manslaughter the following year. Kean, whose brother-in-law, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, was the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and Interim Prime Minister at the time of these events, was arrested on 6 January 2006 and charged with the murder of salesman John Whippy at the Royal Suva Yacht Club, after a wedding reception for Whippy's nephew Samuel Whippy and his bride, Ateca Bainimarama, the Prime Minister's daughter, on 31 December 2006, the Fiji Sun reported. Kean had punched and kicked John Whippy following the latter's drunken insults against him. The attack resulted in Whippy's death. He appeared in Suva Magistrate's Court on 19 January and was remanded in custody at Korovou Prison till 2 February. Magistrate John Semesi refused a request from Kean's lawyer, Abhay Singh, for bail, after Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Raymond Gibson said that Kean would be in a position to interfere with witnesses. (An Indo-Fijian student witnessed the murder and was eventually murdered.) He also refused a request for Kean to be detained at a military barracks. Lawyer Singh had claimed that Kean's life could be endangered if he were to be detained at Korovou, as Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit soldiers, whom Kean had helped prosecute for an army mutiny in 2000, were imprisoned there. Kean's second-in-command, Lieutenant Commander James Fisher, was named on 22 January to act in his stead. Kean, meanwhile, remained on full pay, military spokesman Major Neumi Leweni revealed on 23 January. On 25 January, Justice Gerald Winter granted bail to Kean in the Suva High Court. In granting bail over the objections of the investigating officer, Inspector Alelia Volau (who had claimed in his affidavits that there was a considerable possibility that Kean would abscond if bailed), Winter imposed strict conditions, including the payment of F$1000 in surety (which two of his relatives paid) and the surrender of his passport. In addition, he was not to interfere with prosecution witnesses, had to be on good behaviour, and had to inform the State if he changed his home address. He had to report to the Nabua Police Station each Wednesday and Friday, and a 9 pm ‚àí 7 am curfew was imposed on him. He was also banned from visiting the military camp. Breach of the bail conditions would lead to imprisonment. On 2 February Kean again appeared in court. The case was adjourned until 14 February, to be heard by Magistrate Aminiasi Katonivualiku, after state lawyer Wilisoni Kurisaqila asked for more time to prepare full disclosures. In October 2007 he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for manslaughter, after pleading guilty. He was released, however, after only one week. The charges were reduced from murder to manslaughter because the only witness had been murdered.

(October 6, 1859 ‚Äì August 11, 1955), also known as F.A. Seiberling, was an American innovator and founder. He is most famous for co-founding the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in 1898 and the Seiberling Rubber Company in 1921. He also built Stan Hywet Hall, a Tudor Revival mansion, now a National Historic Landmark and historic house museum in Akron, Ohio. ==Biography== right ===Career=== Son of a German American entrepreneur from Ohio,When Nathan Seiberling settled in Norton he brought with him some of the German ability to build something better mechanically.History of The Seiberling Family by John Frederick Seiberling Seiberling spent two years attending Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, before joining the J.F. Seiberling Company, his father's farm machinery manufacturing business, working there as secretary and treasurer. His father, John Seiberling, founder of that Akron, Ohio company, invented one of the first reaping machines. While working for the company, Seiberling invented a twine binder that tied grain bundles with a bow knot. Many businesses failed in the panics of the 1890s, including the street railway company owned by Seiberling's father. In 1898, Seiberling was jobless, nearing forty years old, with a wife and three children. He learned of the availability of an old strawboard factory in East Akron, which he purchased, together with the it stood on, for $13,500. He borrowed $3,500 for a down payment from a brother- in-law, Lucius C. Miles. In partnership with his brother C.W. Seiberling, he decided to open a rubber company, picked a name, and was selling stock. The company would be named for Charles Goodyear, the discoverer of vulcanization, who had died penniless almost forty years before. While Seiberling and his brother Charles were the co-founders of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, its first president was David E. Hill, a business associate who purchased $30,000 of the company's initial stock. In 1899, Raymond C. Penfield, another brother-in-law, became the second president of the company; Lucius C. Miles followed in the position in 1900. In 1906, Seiberling, until then the secretary and general manager, became the fourth president of the company. Seiberling was credited with 19 patents during his tenure at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. One of his most famous being for the Seiberling State Tire Building machine which was patented in 1908. Invented in collaboration with Goodyear's chief engineer William State, the machine mechanized tire building, which enabled the industry to move away from the cumbersome and time-consuming process of hand building tires. One man could now turn out 60 tires in ten hours as opposed to five tires built by hand. The Seiberling State machine revolutionized tire building and led to an explosion in tire production output. Seiberling set up a tire building machine in a separate room on the factory floor and provided demonstrations to other tire manufacturers. Goodyear granted 50 licenses on the tire building machine and made an estimated $2,000,000 in royalties. By 1913, over half of the tires made in the U.S. were manufactured on the Seiberling State machine. Seiberling and Goodyear received additional patents for creating the first universal tire rim, introducing the double diamond all weather tire tread, and inventing a pneumatic truck tire which eventually replaced the industry standard solid truck tire. By 1916, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company was the largest tire producer in the world.Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens Research Files Seiberling became known as the \\"little Napoleon\\" of the rubber industry because of his small stature and his unremitting determination to succeed. He played a leading role in developing Akron from a small town into the \\"rubber capital of the world.\\" In 1921, Goodyear was refinanced and reorganized, and Frank and Charles Seiberling resigned from the company. Frank Seiberling then began the Seiberling Rubber Company in Barberton, Ohio. During his lifetime, Seiberling became famous for his fair treatment of workers. In 1985, he was inducted into the Tire Industry Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class. ===Philanthropy=== Akron's Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, in which Seiberling was influentialHistory, Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 2012. Accessed 2013-05-19. In June 1911, Seiberling announced that he was financing an attempt at a transatlantic airship flight, to be headed by Melvin Vaniman. In July 1912, the airship Akron exploded, and Vaniman and his crew were killed. During his lifetime, Seiberling used his fortune and influence to create fair housing, build a hospital, improve transportation both locally and nationally, preserve green space for the community's enjoyment and fund countless arts and culture programs and organizations. Seiberling believed true prosperity was gained through the enlightenment and improvement of every citizen. A 1937 Akron Beacon Journal article, stated, \\"One reason we all like the Seiberlings is because they never went 'high hat' on Akron; perhaps no other local family ever enjoyed greater prosperity and achievement . . . yet they were never so busy as to turn a disinterested ear to any pleader for Akron's future or civic welfare . . . No man in Akron ever had a broader conception of Akron's civic problems than Frank Seiberling.\\" Seiberling focused on projects that directly impacted the lives of his Goodyear employees and thereby ensured the success of Akron. He developed and underwrote the creation of Goodyear Heights, a neighborhood for factory workers; and Fairlawn Heights, a neighborhood for white-collar employees. In addition, he was a founder of The Peoples Hospital, the Fairlawn Country Club, and the Metropolitan Park system in Akron. Seiberling also supported four educational institutions, his alma mater Heidelberg College, the University of Akron, Lincoln Memorial University in Cumberland Gap, Tennessee and the Western Reserve Academy a private boys school in Hudson, Ohio.

Originally the site encompassed approximately 3,000 acres of land. Portions of the property were broken off during Seiberling's lifetime to create the Fairlawn Heights neighborhood and Sand Run Metro Park. Today the 501(c)3 museum maintains 70 acres including the 64,500 square foot historic manor home, five service buildings and thirty acres of historic gardens designed by Warren Manning. ===Personal life=== Seiberling was born on October 6, 1859, in Western Star, Ohio, a community a few miles southwest of Akron, in Summit County, Ohio. He was the second of nine children born to John Frederick and Catherine Miller Seiberling. Seiberling had one brother and seven sisters. In 1887, he married Gertrude Ferguson Penfield (1866‚Äì1946). The couple had seven children, three girls (Irene, Virginia, Grace Wenonah) and four boys (Fredrick, Willard, Penfield, and Franklin). Their youngest daughter Grace Wenonah died of bronchial pneumonia at only 18 months old. Seiberling died in Akron on August 11, 1955 of pneumonia, and is buried in Glendale Cemetery. His grandson, John F. Seiberling, Jr., was a U.S. congressman from Ohio. ==Further reading== *French, Michael. \\"Structure, Personality, and Business Strategy in the U.S. Tire Industry: The Seiberling Rubber Company, 1922‚Äì1964.\\" Business History Review. 67:3 (Summer 1993). ==References== == External links == *Seiberling visual history *Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens Category:1859 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Akron, Ohio Category:Heidelberg University (Ohio) alumni Category:American chief executives Category:20th-century American inventors Category:American philanthropists Category:American people of German descent Category:Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company people Category:University of Akron Category:Seiberling family Category:American company founders Category:Burials at Glendale Cemetery, Akron ","title":"Frank Seiberling"},{"id":"9099140","text":"Arlington Baptist High School is a private Christian high school located in Baltimore, Maryland.

The film features mostly antique toy trains moving within fanciful settings to a toccata. Other antique toys, such as dolls (representing passengers and townspeople), automobiles and horse-drawn carriages are featured. Most of the toys come from a mix of museum and private collections, including that of the Museum of the City of New York, and apparently date from before the 1920s. The film is shot from a toy's-eye- view, as if the viewer is following the journey of trains from two cities, beginning with the busy activity of the departure train station and surrounding downtown neighborhood, traveling across the countryside, and ending with trains pulling into the arrival station. A short opening narration by Charles Eames, set in a roundhouse, extols the design merits of toys, especially antique toys, with their \\"direct and unembarrassed manner\\", versus scale models.

In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse to pay tax to protest against the Vietnam War,\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest,\\" New York Post, January 30, 1968 and later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of protest against the war.\\"A Call to War Tax Resistance\\" The Cycle 14 May 1970, p. 7 By 1971, Newfield had begun to question the ideology of the New Left, writing that \\"in its Weathermen, Panther and Yippee incarnations, [the New Left] seems anti-democratic, terroristic, dogmatic, stoned on rhetoric and badly disconnected from everyday reality\\". Newfield's first journalism job was \\"copy boy\\" for The New York Daily Mirror and editor of the weekly West Side News. He lived most of his adult life on historic Charlton Street in Greenwich Village. == Career in journalism == Newfield considered himself a \\"participatory journalist,\\" involved in politics and advocacy. Inspired by Lincoln Steffens, Jacob Riis, and IF Stone, Newfield held himself to a professional standard of moral emotionalism. On this he wrote, \\"Compassion without anger can become merely sentiment or pity. Knowledge without anger can stagnate into mere cynicism and apathy. Anger improves lucidity, persistence, audacity, and memory.\\" In 1964, he was hired by the editor, Dan Wolf, to write for The Village Voice in Greenwich Village. Newfield said he set out to \\"combine activism with writing\\" and advised like-minded journalists to \\"create a constituency for reform and don't stop until you have made some progress or positive results.\\" In 1968, Newfield covered the Chicago Democratic Convention, where he famously threw a typewriter from the window of his Chicago hotel at police that he saw beating demonstrators.Norman Mailer, Miami and the Siege of Chicago: An Informal History of the American Political Conventions of 1968 (Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1969), 170-171. By 1988, Newfield had contributed 700 articles to The Voice, over 24 years on staff as columnist, reporter and senior editor. From 1988, Newfield was editor and writer in an investigative reporting unit at the New York Daily News. Ardently pro-labor, he made a principled choice to support the striking newspaper pressmen. He refused to cross their picket line during the 1990 labor strike, and instead quit the paper. Review of Somebody's Gotta Tell It by Jack Newfield Quickly thereafter joined the New York Post as a columnist.Albert Amateau, \\"Jack Newfield, 66, journalist, Villager, club critic\\", The Villager, Dec. 22-28, 2004 Subsequently, Newfield wrote columns and investigative articles for the New York Sun, the New York Observer, and The Nation. In 1980, the Center for Investigative Reporting awarded Newfield the George Polk Award for Political Reporting, and he received a New York State Bar Association Special Award in 1986 for his series of articles on wrongfully convicted Bobby McLaughlin. In 2000, he was honored with the 25-Year News Achievement Award from the Society of the Silurians. Since 2006, Hunter College awards the Jack Newfield Professorship each spring to a distinguished journalist representative of his legacy of investigative journalism. == Author and filmmaker == Newfield authored books about contemporary political and social phenomena. Newfield wrote \\"A Prophetic Minority\\" (1967), his account of the early 1960s civil rights movement, the formation of the SNCC, the voter registration initiative in Mississippi, the expansion of the SNCC to include white students, and the rise of SDS. A year later, The New York Times called Newfield's book Robert Kennedy: A Memoir (1969) a \\"a perceptive and moving book,\\" and it was received again when it was reissued in 2003, on the 35th anniversary of Kennedy's murder. Newfield was traveling with Kennedy and his campaign when the senator from New York was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles on in June 1968.Amateau, \\"Jack Newfield\\" He endeavors to separate \\"the man from the myth\\" in his first-hand accounted of the assassinated politician. He wrote about Kennedy, \\"Part of him was soldier, priest, radical, and football coach. But he was none of these. He was a politician; His enemies said he was consumed with selfish ambition, a ruthless opportunist exploiting his brother's legend. But he was too passionate and too vulnerable ever to be the cool and confident operator his brother was.\\" Newfield and Jeff Greenfield co-authored \\"A Populist Manifesto : The Making Of A New Minority\\" (1972), an elaboration on their ideas about civic reform, relevant to the banking and insurance industries, utilities, regulatory agencies, land reform, the media, crime, health care, labor unions, and foreign. He cowrote with Paul Du Brul, \\"The Abuse of Power: The Permanent Government and the Fall of New York\\" (Viking Press, 1977) and the revised edition, \\"The Permanent Government: Who Really Rules New York?\\" (Pilgrim Press, 1981), considered classics in urban muckraking. In \\"City for Sale\\" (1988), Newfield collaborated with investigative journalist Wayne Barrett to reveal the patronage of municipal corruption in New York during Ed Koch's administration. In 2003, Newfield's acerbic critique of the mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani, \\"The Full Rudy: The Man, The Myth, The Mania\\" (2002) won the American Book Award. \\"City of Rich and Poor: Jack Newfield on New York\\" (2003 PBS) was a documentary based on Newfield's article, How the Other Half Still Lives: in the shadow of wealth, New York's poor increases. In 1988, \\"Robert Kennedy : A Memoir\\" was adapted into an acclaimed documentary, which Newfield wrote and co-directed. He was writer and reporter of \\"JFK, Hoffa and the Mob\\" (PBS, 1992). Newfield advocated for professional prize fighters to be viewed as members of the \\"exploited working class.\\" He wrote and produced documentaries about professional boxing, including Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson ( TV Movie 1993), Sugar Ray Robinson: Bright Lights, Dark Shadows, (HBO, 1998, co-producer), The Making of Bamboozled (TV movie 2001) and Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story (2005). In 1991, he was a contributing reporter and writer to the documentary Don King Unauthorized (Frontline & Stuart Television co-producers, 1991), which aired on PBS. Shortly thereafter, he authored \\"Only in America The Life and Crimes of Don King (boxing promoter)\\" in 1995, a story serialized in Penthouse Magazine and then adapted it into a 1997 Emmy Award-winning HBO biopic, Don King: Only in America, directed by John Herzfeld, starring Ving Rhames. == Activist == Newfield was an investigative reporter who wrote openly about social reform. His articles often influenced the media and public policy. Notable examples include the creation of a law banning the use of lead paint in apartments, changes in campaign finance laws, the prosecution of corruption and enforcement of regulations to protect the elderly in nursing homes. His series of articles on wrongly convicted and imprisoned Brooklyn resident Bobby McLoughlin helped to exonerate and release him from prison in 1986. Historians of the political movement against lead poisoning in the U.S. trace its origins to the American civil rights and environmental movements, and acknowledge Newfield's series of newspaper articles in New York City about the tragic consequences of lead poisoning, beginning in 1969, for exposing the lead scandal, and then-Mayor John Lindsay's initiation of the first lead poison prevention program, a model for other urban areas. From 1999 to 2004, Newfield wrote a series of columns advocating for the idea of a memorial honoring Jackie Robinson (1919‚Äì1972), legendary for his role as the first black professional baseball player in the major leagues, and Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team captain Pee Wee Reese, who together made history. In 2005, a commemorative sculpture by William Behrends was installed at the center of a circular lawn and perimeter walkway designed by Ken Smith, inscribed with commentary related to the lives and achievements of the athletes, in front of a Brooklyn ball field, Key Span Park. Still working until the end of his life, Jack Newfield died in New York City, succumbing to kidney cancer on December 21, 2004, at the age of 66. ==Awards and recognition== Newfield received the American journalism George Polk Award in 1979 for reporting on politics at the Village Voice. ==Selected bibliography Books === * Newfield, J., (1966).

He went to Mill Hill School and then Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge before returning to east Lancashire where he became a director of companies involved in the weaving and matchmaking industries in Colne and Rawtenstall. ==War service== As the Second World War loomed, Leavey joined up and served in the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards in France and Belgium; he only just escaped at Dunkirk, being one of the last to be evacuated. On arriving back in Britain the regiment underwent training in the midlands where Leavey organised a pack of fox hounds with which to go fox hunting. He was pleased to return to liberate France after D Day, fighting through to the end of the war. He was mentioned in despatches and reached the rank of Major. After demobilisation in 1946, Leavey was employed by the family firm of Smith and Nephew and became a Director in 1948. He joined the Yorkshire Hussars in the Territorial Army as a Major in 1952, but left in 1955. ==Politics== At the 1950 general election he was picked to challenge the already well-known Labour MP Barbara Castle in Blackburn East. At his second shot at the seat in 1951, he cut her majority to the point at which the seat looked vulnerable. Instead of fighting again, he was selected for Heywood and Royton, a Conservative seat where the sitting MP was retiring. ==Parliamentary career== Leavey won at the 1955 general election. He was a strong supporter of the government over the Suez Crisis and attacked nearby Labour MPs for supporting Gamal Abdel Nasser, being rewarded with appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Monckton for one year from 1956 and later to Derick Heathcoat Amory in 1959; however, his loyalty did not stretch to accepting what he saw as government indifference to the local cotton industry. When his pressure resulted in the passing of the Cotton Industry Act 1959, it was felt to have aided his campaign locally; despite it, in 1962, he was one of five Conservative MPs to support a Labour motion of censure on the subject. Some of Leavey's campaigns attracted attention, with his call for an end to the teaching of Latin in schools among them. He was insistent that he knew there had been flying saucers over Lancashire, and wanted girls who went topless to be arrested. He supported Anthony Wedgwood Benn in his campaign to allow peers to renounce their titles. In 1961 he was made Secretary to the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. When Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sacked seven members of his cabinet in the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1962, Leavey praised him for being ruthless with colleagues when necessary. He had a tough fight at the 1964 general election, as Labour had his seat as a target. Leavey, who had a major operation shortly before the election, was ultimately unable by 818 votes to retain it. ==Business appointments== After leaving Parliament he paid more attention to his work at Smith and Nephew (which had continued in the background during his career, and seen him appointed Deputy Chairman in 1962) and also became Chairman of Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, a midlands-based firm of builders. He had other business interests and was a member of the South East London Industrial Tribunal from 1978 to 1984. In 1982 he wrote (together with Richard Bennett) an official history of Smith and Nephew from its foundation in 1856. ==Recreations== Enthusiastic about country activities, Leavey continued to enjoy fox hunting and also took part in point-to-point races. He was a council member of the Outward Bound Trust from 1974 to 1992 and also became a trustee of the Kurt Hahn Trust in 1987. He also enjoyed fishing. ==References== *Who Was Who, A&C; Black *Obituary by John Barnes, The Independent, 15 September 1999.

Also found along river banks and in lawns. It is known to occur in Canada, Oregon, Wisconsin, Washington, and Northern Michigan, (on ancient man-made earthen mounds), but is probably more widely distributed. On the west coast of America, Pholiotina smithii is an early summer mushroom, almost never appearing after the first week of June. ==Edibility== Mildly hallucinogenic, containing psilocin, psilocybin, and baeocystin. Most mycologists recommend against eating this mushroom because it is difficult to distinguish from poisonous species.

It is located just north of downtown Jacksonville on Main Street (U.S. Highway 17). It opened in 1927, the same time as Robert E. Lee High School. It was originally an all-white school, but the school became integrated in 1970. It is named for U.S. President Andrew Jackson, an important figure in the history of Florida, after whom the city of Jacksonville is also named. Jackson has the city's oldest athletic rivalry with Robert E. Lee High School. For many years the Jackson-Lee football game was played in the Gator Bowl Stadium on Thanksgiving Day, and it was a major event for students and alumni of both schools. The girls varsity basketball team were 2007 Gateway Conference Champions, beating out Samuel W. Wolfson High School. They won this award three consecutive years. Jackson is the only high school in Duval County with an off-campus football stadium. The stadium is located about three-fourths of a mile north of the campus on Main Street, adjacent to North Shore Elementary School. Prior to the construction of this facility the Tigers played their home football games at the Gator Bowl. When Duval County Schools were first being established, Jackson was on the verge of losing accreditation due to roof leaks, cracks and window damage. These problems were fixed and the school now hosts magnet programs. In 2017 Andrew Jackson High School celebrated its 90th anniversary. ==Academics== Dedicated Magnet students may go into the Cybersecurity program, the Video Game Design program, the Sports Medicine and Biomechanics program, or the Air Force JROTC military magnet program. Students can also earn an Associate of Science degree in Networking Systems, IT Cybersecurity, through a partnership with Florida State College of Jacksonville while attending high school. The school also offers the BCE program which is partnered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida. Junior students are hired to work part-time on campus and have the opportunity to continue that career after graduation. The school currently has a B as of 2017 on the Florida School Accountability Grading Scale. ==Notable alumni== * W.

He designed most of the buildings at Columbia College's now-demolished old campus on Madison Avenue, and designed numerous buildings at Yale University, many of which have survived (even though Yale's collegiate-gothic architecture is more often associated with the better known James Gamble Rogers). He designed the master plan and many of the buildings on the campus of the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea, New York, most of which have survived. Haight's architectural drawings and photographs are held in the Dept. of Drawings and Archives at the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City. ==Biography== Haight was born at New York City on March 17, 1841, the son of Rev. Benjamin I. Haight and his wife, Hetty Coolidge. He graduated from Columbia College in 1861, and studied law at Columbia until the outbreak of America's Civil War. In 1862, Haight enlisted at Baltimore with New York's Seventh Regiment, and then fought with the Thirty-first New York Volunteers. In 1864, he was wounded during the Battle of the Wilderness, after which he retired from military service.Obituary, Columbia Alumni News, 1917. After the war, Haight apprenticed with the architect Emlen T. Littel (1840‚Äì91) until 1867 when he opened his own office. In 1865, Haight married Euphemia Kneeland (1842‚Äì1909),The New York Times, September 20, 1865. with whom he had four children.

Combined with neighbouring York Harbour, there is a population of about 866. Blow Me Down Provincial Park lies on the boundary between the two communities. ==Captain James Cook and the naming of Lark Harbour and York Harbour== Local legend has it that James Cook named the harbours after two of his ships. However, while it is true that Cook spent the years 1764 to 1767 surveying and charting the coasts of Newfoundland and was working in the Bay of Islands in the summer of 1767, he had charge of only one ship, the schooner Grenville. Not a naval vessel, and built and operated in Massachusetts under the name Sally, she had been purchased by the Royal Navy for Cook's use while surveying. HMS Lark and HMS York, after which the harbours were named, were ships of the Royal Navy's Newfoundland Squadron. To command such ships a naval commission was required, and Cook held no such commission during his years in Newfoundland: he was at that time a sailing master. The title of captain, or commander, was reserved for commissioned officers of the Navy. Most of the names of natural features, such as Blow-me-down Mountain, Tweed Island, Guernsey Island and Pearl Island, (these last three also named after frigates of the Newfoundland Squadron) had appeared earlier on maps drawn by Joseph Gilbert, who was sailing master aboard HMS Guernsey when the British Governor of Newfoundland, Hugh Palliser, visited the Bay of Islands in 1764. Palliser, newly appointed to his responsibilities as governor, quickly understood that reliable charts of the waters around Newfoundland would be useful tools in the Navy's defence strategy. Cook was already a capable surveyor, and it was Palliser who assigned him to the task in Newfoundland. Cook would undoubtedly have had copies of any existing charts and log notes, including Gilbert's, when he began his work, and would have incorporated into his own work the names he saw on those documents. ==See also== *List of lighthouses in Canada ==References== ==External links== * Aids to Navigation Canadian Coast Guard Category:Towns in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Lighthouses in Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Lark Harbour"},{"id":"9099295","text":"Richard Hastings Ellis (July 19, 1919March 28, 1989) was a United States Air Force general who served as the commander in chief of the Strategic Air Command and director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff with headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.

The station's programmers have always contributed on a voluntary basis. Tilos R√°di√≥ has never broadcast advertisements, and has a strong social and freedom-of- expression commitment. Tilos R√°di√≥ was established as a pirate community radio station in Budapest in 1991 as a way of bringing the public's attention to the fact that there was at that time no legal framework for independent and community broadcasters. During the first years of its broadcasting, Tilos (meaning \\"forbidden\\" in Hungarian) enjoyed wide public interest and played a key role in the 1995 liberalisation of the airwaves in Hungary. Tilos R√°di√≥ obtained a legal frequency license in 1995 and became a popular local community station in Budapest with its morning phone-in talk-shows and its music programmes, broadcasting 12 hours a day. Tilos is a key player in the cultural and lifestyle scene of Budapest. Meanwhile, Tilos R√°di√≥ has its fingers on the public pulse with its social thinking, minority oriented programmes, and its radical and tolerant attitude. Tilos' broadcasts are mainly financed by listeners' donations and the income from fund-raising events, and partly by support from EU programmes, international NGOs and charity institutions. In November 1999, Tilos R√°di√≥ had to apply for a new frequency licence. Tilos R√°di√≥ wanted to broadcast 24 hours a day. Tilos did not receive a new frequency licence ‚Äì this meant that the radio had to leave its frequency in 1999. In October 2002, 3 years later, with its third application, Tilos R√°di√≥ received a licence for the 90.3 MHz frequency in Budapest for seven years. Tilos R√°di√≥ can also be heard via cable and via Internet 24 hours a day. In 2011 Hungary's new media authority (Nemzeti M√©dia- √©s H√≠rk√∂zl√©si Hat√≥s√°g) has begun investigating Tilos R√°di√≥ for playing a song by rapper Ice-T which it said \\"could influence the development of minors in a negative way\\" on 2 September 2010 (at 5.51pm). The Nemzeti M√©dia- √©s H√≠rk√∂zl√©si Hat√≥s√°g said the song should only have been broadcast after 21.00pm. (BBC) Tilos R√°di√≥ argues that since the lyrics are in English and the knowledge of foreign languages among the Hungarian population is far below EU average, furthermore the station has very few young listeners, so the song could not have an \\"adverse affect [sic] on the moral development\\" of children under 16. (Tilos R√°di√≥) Hungarian authorities said their investigation is based on a 1996 law regulating radio and television. (SeattlePI.com) Tilos R√°di√≥ points out that \\"up till this point, for over a decade, it hasn‚Äôt occurred that the authority would investigate and disapprove of the lyrics of a non-Hungarian song\\".

A fantasy rather than a science fiction story, it was based on an idea by Bob Mills, editor of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, but rejected by him. It was instead published in the September 1959 issue of Fantastic Universe and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. ==Plot summary== The story \\"Rain, Rain, Go Away\\" concerns a seemingly perfect family, the Sakkaros, who become neighbors of another family, the Wrights. The Wrights are puzzled at the great lengths the Sakkaros go to avoid any contact with water, such as when Mrs. Wright tells her husband that Mrs. Sakkaro's kitchen was so clean, it seemed to be never used, and when she offered Mrs. Wright a glass of water she filled the glass carefully while covered with a napkin, but Mr. Wright chalks it up to Mrs. Sakkaro being a good neighbor. The only other odd fact about the home was that the family always seems to be tanning, but at the slightest chance of rain, they all rush inside the safety of their home. Mr. & Mrs. Wright see the study of the Sakkaro residence is filled with newspapers and encyclopedias, which Mr. Sakkaro explains is part of his research. Nor does the Wright know the ethnicity of their neighbors, with Mrs. Wright thinking it could be a Spanish name while Mr. Wright thinks \\"Sakkaro\\" sounds Japanese. The name \\"Sakkaro\\" is an apparent wordplay on saccharo-, a combining form that means \\"sugar\\", by Asimov, who displayed a fondness for puns. To find out more about the Sakkaros the Wrights invite them out, and the Sakkaros pay for them all to go to a town carnival. The Sakkaros are extremely cautious and bring a radio with them that is tuned to the weather channel, and a barometer. At the carnival, they seem to have a good time with Mr. & Mrs. Wright and their son Tommie, but they display bizarre food choices, particularly nothing but cotton candy. Mr. Wright comments to his wife that he offered to buy Mr. Sakkaro a hamburger, who grimly refused, and Mrs. Wright also remarks that she had a similar reaction from Mrs. Sakkaro when she offered a soft drink. When their radio unexpectedly calls for rain, the Sakkaros appear to be in shock until they get to their house. When they pull up, it starts to drizzle, and the Sakkaros rush to get to the safety of their home.

Her mission was as a drone controller and was used to monitor the Greenhouse Series of nuclear testing at Eniwetok Atoll in the 1950s. Piccadilly Lilly II's designation was changed again in November 1956 from DB-17G to DB-17P and was used as a drone controller at Holloman AFB with the 3225th Drone Squadron from 1956 through 1959. Her last mission was on August 6, 1959, when she controlled a QB-17G 44-83717 drone as a target for a Falcon air-to-air missile fired by an F-101B Voodoo jet fighter. A few days later she was officially retired in a ceremony at Holloman AFB; the last B-17 to serve in the U.S. Air Force. Piccadilly Lilly II became a part of the Planes of Fame collection on September 24, 1959, which was then located in Claremont, CA. Planes of Fame founder Edward Maloney wasted no time and put her to work right away appearing on TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúDick Powell Theater\\" in a program about the famed 100th (The Bloody Hundredth) Bomb Group. She later became known as Piccadilly Lilly II when she was used in the popular 1960‚Äôs TV series Twelve O‚Äôclock High. She was flown by Planes of Fame from 1959 through 1971. During those years she starred in many Hollywood productions including the 1969 movie The Thousand Plane Raid. In 1971 she was grounded and has been on display since then at Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California. January 2013, Piccadilly Lilly II is still under restoration. ==Currently== In late 2008, the Museum assembled a volunteer restoration team to accelerate the process of bringing B-17G, #44-83684, ‚ÄúPiccadilly Lilly II‚Äù back to flight condition. In 2009, significant progress was made with respect to the short- term goals of 1) enhancing the visitor experience and 2) systematically repairing and mitigating on-going degradation of structural components. Efforts have focused on the restoration of various crew stations so that visitors can more easily put themselves in the shoes of a young crew member at 25,000 feet on a bombing run over enemy territory in late World War II. The ball turret has been restored and a machine gun (with new ammo box) mounted in one of the waist gunner positions. New gun barrels were fabricated and added to the tail and chin positions and a fully refurbished, modified top turret has been installed. Both the ball turret and top turret can be manually operated. New signage (part of an Eagle Scout project) directs visitor attention to, and provides information about, various features of the aircraft. Crew station equipment, particularly in the radio compartment and tail gunner positions are being restored, replaced with new surplus items, or if necessary, fabricated in preparation for reinstallation when structural repairs are completed in those positions. The tail cone has been removed and structural repairs in it are nearing completion after the tedious task of stripping all old paint was completed. The same is true of the radio compartment where structural repairs are underway following the laborious task of stripping paint. All equipment from the nose has been removed from the aircraft. Stripping paint from the nose and performing much needed repairs there will follow completion of the tail gunner and radio operator positions. Wooden components have been rebuilt or refabricated, including the floor in the waist, an electrical junction box in the bomb bay, two ammo boxes (the first two of several), the tail gunner seat, the radio operator‚Äôs desk (using mostly original wooden components), and the navigator‚Äôs desk with the restoration and re-fabrication of interior wooden doors is still in progress. All props have been stripped and prepared for painting plus the tail wheel assembly and main landing gear have been cleaned and repainted. Restoration of peripheral equipment such as bombs and bomb carts is also nearing completion. In addition to the structural repairs in the radio compartment and tail gunner position, numerous repairs have been made to the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and related fairings. The vertical stabilizer is ready for remounting. Radio mounting brackets and landing light housings have been refabricated from scratch. When completed, the plane will be only 1 of 10 Flying Fortresses in the world in flying condition. In 2010, the total cost of restoration was estimated to be about one million dollars. ==References== ==External links== Category:Individual aircraft of World War II Category:Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress ","title":"Piccadilly Lilly II"},{"id":"9099431","text":"John Wardrop may refer to: *John Glen Wardrop, English transport analyst *Sir John Oliver Wardrop (1864-1948), English diplomat *Jack Wardrop, British swimmer ","title":"John Wardrop"},{"id":"9099458","text":"CSM Corona Bra»ôov, formerly known as Rulmentul Bra»ôov, is a professional women's handball club in Bra»ôov, Romania, that plays in the Divizia A. == Honours == *Challenge Cup: **Winners (1): 2006 *Cup Winners' Cup: **Runners- Up: 2008 *EHF Champions League: **Third place: 1982 *EHF Cup: **Third place: 2009, 2016 *Liga Na≈£ionalƒÉ: **Winners (2): 1981, 2006 **Runners-Up: 1984, 1986, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2014 **Third place: 1983, 1987, 2015, 2016 *Cupa Rom√¢niei: **Winners (2): 1981, 2006 **Runners-Up: 1984, 1995, 2007, 2013 **Third place: 2014 ==TeamCurrent squad=== Squad for the 2020-21 season ;Goalkeepers: * Ioana Ugran ;Wingers: ;Left Wings ;Right Wings * Ana Maria Berbece * Flavia Munteanu ;Line players * Tatjana Trboviƒá * Georgiana Olaru * Sarah Darie ;Backs ;Left Backs * Carla LƒÉcƒÉtu»ô ;Centre Backs * Monica BƒÉrƒÉba≈ü * Tamara Smbatian ;Right Backs * Jelena Terziƒá * Alicia Gog√ÆrlƒÉ ==Notable managers== * Dumitru Popescu-Coliba»ôi * Mariana T√ÆrcƒÉ * Bogdan Burcea * Herbert M√ºller ==Notable players== * Irene Oancea * Mariana T√ÆrcƒÉ * Paula Ungureanu * Andreea Pricopi * Patricia Vizitiu * Cristina Neagu * Simona Gog√ÆrlƒÉ * Denisa Dedu * Laura Chiper * Camelia Hotea * Cristina Zamfir * Ionica Munteanu * Adriana »öƒÉcƒÉlie * Sorina T√ÆrcƒÉ * Eliza Buceschi * Daria Bucur * Gabriela Roti»ô * Woo Sun-hee * Alexandrina Barbosa ==External links== * * Category:Handball clubs established in 1960 Category:Liga Na»õionalƒÉ (women's handball) clubs Category:Sport in Bra»ôov Category:1960 establishments in Romania ","title":"CSM Corona Bra»ôov (women's handball)"},{"id":"9099499","text":"Right for the Time is an album by American country music artist Waylon Jennings, released on Justice Records, an independent label, in 1996.

The play is a tragicomedy about a small rural town in Ireland where many of the townspeople are extras in a Hollywood film. The story centres on Charlie Conlon and Jake Quinn, who, like much of the town, are employed as extras for the filming. The key point in the play is when a local teenager commits suicide, by drowning himself with stones in his pockets, after he is humiliated by one of the film stars. The script calls upon the cast of two to perform all 15 characters (men and women), often switching gender and voice swiftly and with minimal costume change ‚Äì a hat here, a jacket there. Comedy also derives from the efforts of the production crew to create the proper \\"Irish feel\\" ‚Äì a romanticised ideal that often conflicts with the reality of daily life. The play was first shown in Belfast in 1996 and went on to have a successful run in London's West End. The original cast of Conleth Hill and Sean Campion later took the show to Broadway. Having won the Irish Times/ESB Irish Theatre Award for Best Production in 1999, the play also won two Olivier Awards in 2001 for Best New Comedy and Best Actor (Conleth Hill). ==Plot summary== The drama is set in a rural town in County Kerry, Ireland, that is overrun by a Hollywood film crew. The play centres around two friends, Charlie Conlon and Jake Quinn, employed as extras on the film. Charlie has aspirations to get his script made into a movie. Jake has recently returned from New York and is mesmerised, along with everyone else, by the star of the movie, Caroline. Caroline is a famous, beautiful American movie star that fails to ever successfully conquer the Irish accent. Caroline and the other American crew members do not attempt to accurately portray the town and people and only care about finishing the movie on time. Most of the locals are initially excited at the opportunity to be a part of a major film and distracted by the novelty. However, as the film continues they begin to feel abused and the glamour begins to wear off. After a night in the pub, a local teenager, Sean Harkin, is humiliated by Caroline and thrown out into the street for trying to socialise with her. The first act ends when Sean commits suicide by drowning himself with stones in his pockets. The second act continues the story with the town devastated by the loss. Jake begins to blame himself for not reaching out to the boy and Charlie tries to console him and let him not lose hope. Conflict arises when the film crew is hesitant about letting the extras have a break for Sean‚Äôs funeral. It becomes even more apparent to the town that the film crew has their own agenda and no concern for the people. Jake and Charlie decide to rewrite Charlie‚Äôs script and make it about Sean‚Äôs story instead. They present their idea to the American director who in turn tells them the story is not romantic or commercial enough. ==Productions== The play began life as a Dubbeljoint Production premiering in West Belfast Festival in August 1996 - the original cast was Conleth Hill and Tim Murphy. The set design, by Jack Kirwan, is simple - a backcloth depicting the cloudy sky above the Blasket Islands, a row of shoes (symbolising the myriad characters) and a trunk, a box, and two tiny stools. The lighting design was originally by James C. McFetridge and this design was used in both the London West End and the Broadway versions of the shows. The play began life at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast with the initial run touring to the small community hall in Ballybean estate, East Belfast, and the Culturlan on the Falls Road in West Belfast (where it played to roughly five people). The script was modified heavily during the rehearsal period by Marie Jones, Ian McElhinney and the cast with re-writes occurring regularly. The show moved to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1999. The show then returned to Ireland and had a brief run in Dublin before moving to London's Tricycle Theatre, it then transferred to the New Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End. The show, however, proved so successful, its run was extended and moved to the Duke of York's Theatre up the road, where it remained for three years. The original cast of Conleth Hill and Sean Campion took the show to Broadway and, as its West End run continued to play to packed houses, actors were lining up to play Charlie and Jake, most notably Bronson Pinchot, Rupert Degas and Simon Delaney. It won the Irish Times/ESB Irish Theatre Award for Best Production in 1999, won two Olivier Awards in 2001 for Best New Comedy and Best Actor (Conleth Hill) and was also nominated for three Tony Awards in 2001. Gothenburg English Studio Theatre made a production of Stones in His Pockets in 2009. It was directed by Malachi Bogdanov with Mike Rogers and Gary Whitaker. It was revived at London's Tricycle Theatre in 2011, with Jamie Beamish as Charlie and Owen McDonnell as Jake, and at the Tron, Glasgow in 2012 performed by Robbie Jack and Keith Fleming. For the 20th anniversary of the first production, The Dukes in Lancaster and The Theatre Chipping Norton co-produced a touring production which opened at The Dukes on 25 February 2016 and toured 35 venues between then and 28 May 2016. Charlie de Bromhead played Jake and Conan Sweeny played Charlie. ==See also== * Irish theatre ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * irishplayography.com Category:Broadway plays Category:Comedy plays Category:Plays by Marie Jones Category:Laurence Olivier Award-winning plays Category:West End plays Category:Two-handers Category:1996 plays ","title":"Stones in His Pockets"},{"id":"9099508","text":"Erishum I or Eri≈°u(m) I (inscribed me-ri-≈°u, or mAPIN-√¨≈° in later texts but always with an initial i in his own seal, inscriptions, and those of his immediate successors, ‚Äúhe has desired,‚Äù) c. 1905 BC ‚Äî c. 1866 BC (short chronology) or c. 1974 BC ‚Äî c. 1935 BC (middle chronology),Some historians quote ca. 1939‚Äì1900 BC (after Am√©lie Kuhrt, The Ancient Near East, C. 3000-330 BC, Volume 1, Routledge, 1996, p. 82). son of Ilu-shuma, was the thirty-third ruler of Assyria to appear on the Assyrian King List.

He had titled himself both as, \\"Ashur is king, Erishum I is vice- regent\\"da-≈°√πr LUGAL i-ri-≈°u-um PA. and the, ‚ÄúI≈°≈°i‚Äôak A≈°≈°ur‚Äùki (‚Äústeward of Assur‚Äù), at a time when Assur was controlled by an oligarchy of the patriarchs of the prominent families and subject to the ‚Äújudgment of the city‚Äù, or dƒ´n alim. According to Veenhof, Erishum I‚Äôs reign marks the period when the institution of the annually appointed limmu (eponym) was introduced. The Assyrian King List observes of his immediate predecessors, ‚Äúin all six kings known from bricks, whose limmu have not been marked/found‚Äù. ==Biography== As Assur's merchant family firms vigorously pursued commercial expansion, Eri≈°um I had established distant trading outposts in Anatolia referred to as karums. Karums were established along trade routes into Anatolia and included: Kanesh, Ankuwa, Hattusa, and eighteen other locations that have yet to be identified, some of which had been designated as ‚Äúwarbatums‚Äù (satellites of and subordinate to the karums') The markets traded in: tin (inscribed AN.NA, Akkadian: annukum), textiles, lapis lazuli, iron, antimony, copper, bronze, wool, and grain, in exchange for gold and silver. Around 23,000 tablets have been found at Kanesh spanning a period of 129 years from the thirtieth year of Erishum I‚Äôs reign through to that of Puzur-Ashur II or possibly Naram-Sin with the earliest from level II including copies of his inscriptions. These were discovered in 1948 with three other similar though fragmentary lists and two copies of an inscription of Erishum I detailing the regulations concerning the administration of justice in Assur, including the possibility of plaintiffs to obtain a rƒÅbi·π£um (attorney) to represent them: Following the example set by Erishum I's father (Ilu-shuma), he had proclaimed tax exemptions, or as Michael Hudson has interpreted, \\"Erishum I proclaimed a remission of debts payable in silver, gold, copper, tin, barley, wool, down to chaff.\\" This appears in an inscription on one side of a large broken block of alabaster,BM 115689, Ass. 16850. apparently described as a ·π≠uppu. The shallow depression on its top has led some to identify it as a door socket. His numerous contemporary inscriptions commemorate his building of the temple for Assur, called ‚ÄúWild Bull‚Äù with its courtyard and two beer vats and the accompanying curses to those who would use them for their intended purposes. Erishum I‚Äôs other civic constructions included the temple of Ishtar and that of Adad. He had exercised eminent domain to clear an area from the Sheep Gate to the People‚Äôs Gate to make way for an enlargement of the city wall, so that he could boast that ‚ÄúI made a wall higher than the wall my father had constructed.‚Äù His efforts had been recalled by the later kings ≈†am≈°i-Adad I, in his rebuilding dedication, and ≈†ulmanu-a≈°ared I, who noted that 159 years had passed between Erishum I‚Äôs work and that of Shamsh-Adad I, and a further 580 years until his own when a fire had gutted it. ==Limmu during Erishum I's reign== The following is a list of the annually-elected limmu from the first full year of Erishum I's reign until the year of his death c. 1935 BC (middle chronology): 1974 BC ≈†u-I≈°tar, son of Abila 1973 BC ≈†ukutum, son of I≈°uhum 1972 BC Iddin-ilum, son of Kurub-I≈°tar 1971 BC ≈†u-Anim, son of Isalia 1970 BC Anah-ili, son of Kiki 1969 BC Suitaya, son of Ir'ibum 1968 BC Daya, son of I≈°uhum 1967 BC Ili-ellat 1966 BC ≈†ama≈°-t.ab 1965 BC Agusa 1964 BC Idnaya, son of ≈†udaya 1963 BC Quqadum, son of Buzu 1962 BC Puzur-I≈°tar, son of Bedaki 1961 BC Laqip, son of Bab-idi 1960 BC ≈†u-Laban, son of Kurub-I≈°tar 1959 BC ≈†u-Belum, son of I≈°uhum 1958 BC Nab-Suen, son of ≈†u-I≈°tar 1957 BC Hadaya, son of Elali 1956 BC Ennum-A≈°≈°ur, son of Begaya 1955 BC Ikunum, son of ≈†udaya 1954 BC Is.mid-ili, son of Idida 1953 BC Buzutaya, son of I≈°uhum 1952 BC ≈†u-I≈°tar, son of Amaya 1951 BC Iddin-A≈°≈°ur, son of the priest 1950 BC Puzur-A≈°≈°ur, the ghee maker 1949 BC Quqadum, son of Buzu 1948 BC Ibni-Adad, son of Susaya 1947 BC Iri≈°um, son of Adad-rabi 1946 BC Minanum, son of Begaya 1945 BC Iddin-Suen, son of ≈†alim-ahum 1944 BC Puzur-A≈°≈°ur, son of Idnaya 1943 BC ≈†uli, son of Uphakum 1942 BC Laqip, son of Zukua 1941 BC Puzur-I≈°tar, son of Erisua 1940 BC Aguwa, son of Adad-rabi 1939 BC ≈†u-Suen, son of S.illia 1938 BC Ennum-A≈°≈°ur, son of Begaya 1937 BC Enna-Suen, son of Pussanum 1936 BC Ennanum, son of Uphakum 1935 BC Buzi, son of Adad-rabi ==See also== * Timeline of the Assyrian Empire * Old Assyrian Empire * List of Assyrian kings * Assyrian continuity * Assyrian people ==Inscriptions== ==Notes== ==References== Category:20th- century BC Assyrian kings Category:19th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:20th-century BC rulers Category:19th-century BC rulers ","title":"Erishum I"},{"id":"9099516","text":"An evil version of Minilla battles the Toho superhero Greenman. is a tokusatsu television series Kyodai Hero kaiju produced by Toho in 1973. It ran from November 12, 1973, to September 27, 1974. It emerged as a follow-up series to Ike! Godman, but the two share no continuity. Compared to Ike! Godman, Go! Greenman has an established plot. ==Synopsis== Deep beneath Japan, a demonic orange, fang-faced creature with glowing red eyes called Maoh awakes in Hell and plots his escape after being imprisoned there by God. But, in order to do this, he has to obtain the blood of human children and summons his cowardly purple jellyfish-like female servant Tonchiki to assist him. Through her he uses beak-faced, pointy-headed clay doll phantom warriors called Maoh-no Teshita (\\"Minions of Maoh\\") that can be transformed into hideous kaiju to complete his task. A set of four special minions, dubbed the 'Kaijin', appeared towards the end of the series, each bearing unique abilities and fighting without the requirement to transform. However, his plans are quickly foiled after the mighty robot Greenman, a self-described \\"envoy of God\\" who can grow to giant size and fire missiles from his chest, descends from space to do battle against Maoh's pawns. After his first battle on Earth, he gives the kids two devices called 'Green Calls' which can be used to summon him whenever the children are in danger. ==Returning Monsters== Famously, and in line with the previous Ike! Godman, numerous monsters from Toho's library of Kaiju made appearances in the series. *04. Gaira from The War of the Gargantuas. *14. Gabara from All Monsters Attack. *31.

Church played Second XI cricket for Surrey in 1993, as well as appearing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Young Cricketers, but his first-class debut was for Worcestershire against Nottinghamshire in August 1994: opening the batting with captain Tim Curtis, he scored 22 and 0. Immediately afterwards he made his List A debut, against the same opponents, in the AXA Equity and Law League and made 18. He stayed in both the Championship and one-day sides until the end of the season, albeit with limited success. The start of the 1995 season saw Church play only occasionally for the first team, and he never made the impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average in the mid- teens and a top score of only 35 in a total of 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the face of it, with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50. He made the short journey to Gloucestershire for 1997, but again made only a few senior appearances, spending most of the season in the seconds. In those he had a couple of useful innings - 53 and 49 against Pakistan A in a first-class and one-day tour match respectively - but for the most part he had to content himself with piling up the runs in the Second XI, for whom he hit three hundreds. 1998 was only slightly better, and though he picked up the man-of-the-match award for an unbeaten 64 against Hampshire he managed very little else above second-team level. Church left Gloucestershire, and senior cricket, after the 1998 season, although he did have a couple more minor outings several years later: one for Surrey Cricket Board in the 2002 ECB 38-County Cup and another for the Duke of Norfolk's XI against Ireland the following year; in both matches he made a duck, though he did manage one wicket in the earlier game. ==External links== * * Statistical summary from CricketArchive Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Gloucestershire cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Guildford ","title":"Matthew Church"},{"id":"9099540","text":"The Snake River Ranch, near Wilson, Wyoming, is the largest deeded ranch in the Jackson Hole area. The ranch buildings are grouped into three complexes comprising headquarters, residential and shop complexes. The ranch combined two neighboring homesteads and was first owned by advertising executive Stanley B. Resor and his wife, Helen Lansdowne Resor. The Resors used the property as a vacation home, but the ranch was also a full-time, self- sustaining operation. The ranch could produce its own food, water and electricity. It became significant for the Resors' employment of notable architects, include Mies van der Rohe, and the wide variety of celebrity visitors it attracted. The Snake River Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. ==History== The Resors' primary home was in Greenwich, Connecticut, convenient to the JWT offices in New York City. In 1929 Stanley and Helen's twelve-year-old son Stanley Rogers Resor spent part of the summer in Jackson Hole with the Huyler family, who had bought a ranch on the Snake River. The younger Stanley's enthusiasm about his experience led his father to buy of land, sight unseen. The entire family arrived in 1930 to see one pre-existing cabin, a barn, and what would become known as the One- Room Cabin and the Parking Lot Cabin. The family was enthusiastic about the ranch, tempered by Helen's preference for New York. To begin expanding the ranch the Resors hired architect Paul Colborn of New Canaan, Connecticut to design a new main house. Work was well under way by the end of the summer, and Colborn ended up buying land for himself as well, which became known as the Aspen Ranch. The Resor property reputedly had the first flush toilets in Jackson Hole, as well as electricity generated on site. Stanley Resor became enthusiastic about building a functioning ranch operation. During 1931 Resor established the ranch as a self-sustaining unit. He pulled down the old barn and hired landscape architect Isabelle Pendleton to lay out the headquarters complex. In 1933 a water wheel was added to the side of the ranch's pumphouse, which proved troublesome when it froze in the winter. In 1938 a Fitz turbine was installed in its place, to provide electricity, and was not retired until 1955. In the late 1930s the ranch infrastructure was further developed with the building of the shop complex. ===Mies van der Rohe=== In 1936 the Resors built the White Cabin for guest quarters. The White Cabin was designed by Philip Goodwin, who worked with Edward Durrell Stone on the Museum of Modern Art, and was on the board of directors of MOMA along with Helen Lansdowne Resor. The cabin's white interior lent it its name. Soon after, Helen asked architect Mark Peters, a relative of one of the younger Resor's school classmates, to \\"design a building in the style of Le Corbusier\\". The dining room, as it was called, was to span the mill stream, the arm of the Snake River that fed the power turbine, resting on four concrete piers. At some point Helen Resor lost confidence in the Peters design and sought another architect. She apparently turned to MOMA director Alfred Barr for advice. As a result of internal divisions within the MOMA board, which was divided between a faction led by Abby Rockefeller who supported Stone and Goodwin for the new MOMA building and a faction led by Barr and Resor who supported Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Helen Resor hired Mies to complete the dining room, his first project in the United States. The Resors also considered Walter Gropius but settled on Mies as a more practical choice. In summer 1937 the Resors met Mies in Paris, and he accompanied them back across the Atlantic for his first trip to the United States, stopping in Chicago before going on the Wyoming. Mies stayed in the White Cabin, sharing it for a time with artist Grant Wood, a figurative painter of American themes. Mies stayed for two months before moving back to Chicago to be offered the directorship of the Armour Institute of Technology. Back in Chicago, Mies developed elaborate plans for a two-story building connecting the banks of the stream using long floor-to-ceiling windows. The only concession Mies made to the Western aesthetic of the ranch was to use wood to clad the building, for the first and only time in his career. However, rather than the Resors' preferred local lodgepole pine, Mies settled on cypress. Mies did choose to use local fieldstone for the ground- level walls, the fireplace and central stairs. By March 1938, Mies was returning to Germany on the RMS Queen Mary when he received notice from Stanley Resor that the project was canceled, citing \\"business conditions\\". Resor suggested that the project might continue if Mies returned to the United States and worked with an American architect familiar with American construction practices. The project was projected to cost more than twice its budget, and there were technical difficulties with the proposed glazing. By fall 1938, Mies had returned to Chicago and had resumed work on the project, scaling it back somewhat, but it was finally canceled. Whatever the outcome of the design work at the Resors' ranch, the project played a significant role in Mies' departure from Germany just prior to the outbreak of war with a regime that was hostile to Modernist architecture. ==Ranch operations== Stanley Resor developed the ranch into an efficient operation that could run without his direct management. By 1938 Resor's holdings included the Lower Ranch, south of Wilson, Wyoming (actually two ranches), and four more in the main valley, all totaling , second only to the Snake River Land Company. A major flood in 1943 was the result of water unexpectedly released by Jackson Lake Dam. The flood destroyed the millstream headgate and the power house, and flooded the White Cabin with of water. The piers for the proposed dining room were upset. Had the dining room addition been built, it would have been damaged or destroyed. As a result of the flood Resor, on the advice of Arthur Ernest Morgan, consulted with engineer C.C. Chambers, who designed a dike system for the ranch. The dike project was hampered by a wartime labor shortage, which affected ranch operations as well. Resor increasingly mechanized the ranch as a result. By the time of Stanley Resor's death in 1962, the operation was mature. The ranch remains in the Resor family. ==Description== The ranch is functionally divided into three sections. ===Shop complex=== The shop complex is at the north end of the site. The complex is the location of the headgate inlet from the Snake River to the ranch's irrigation ditch. Structures include the * Cowboy Barn (Harnessing Barn) 1931-1937 * Scale House * Dipping Vat, late 1930s * Snake River Dike and Heagate, constructed after flooding in 1943 * Calving Barn (Vet Shack) * Fuel Shed (Turkey Coop), early 1930s ===Ranch Headquarters Complex=== The ranch headquarters complex is the next compound to the south and is arranged in a rectangle around a central open area. The site and buildings were designed by architect Isabelle Pendleton to frame a view of the Teton Range. * Root Cellar * Potting Shed * Blacksmith Shop' * Office (Bunkhouse) (1935, rebuilt in the 1970s after a fire, non-contributing due to recent construction compared to other elements) * Woodshed (Coal House) * Manager's House, 1931 * Ice House, 1933 * Milk House, 1931 * Turbine House and Dam, 1938 * Penthouse (Old Shop and Bunkhouse). 1943 * Main Barn, 1931 * Saddle House ===Residential Complex=== The southernmost group of buildings was used for family and guest quarters. * Main Cabin, designed by Paul Colborn * Kitchen Cabin, 1916‚Äì1917, expanded 1930s and 1960s. * White Cabin, 1936, designed by Philip L. Goodwin * Parking Lot Cabin, 1930 * Swimming Pool, circa 1936 * Mies van der Rohe building piers, intended to support a dining room spanning the mill stream designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The piers are long, thick and from their below-grade bearing to the top. The piers were to support a two-story structure. The building project was halted in 1938 and damaged by flooding in 1943. ==Notable visitors== *Peter Blume *George H. W.

He was a team-member of the All Blacks and the New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team in the 1940s. ==Early life== Couch was born in 1925 in Lyttelton. He was raised by his maternal grandmother in Christchurch until the age of eight, when he was sent to live with his maternal uncle near Pirinoa in rural Wairarapa. He was educated at ≈åtaki MƒÅori College, and then, from 1940 to 1942, Christchurch Technical College. After a carpentry apprenticeship in Christchurch, Couch joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force in August 1943, and later transferred to the army. In 1945, Couch returned to Pirinoa to work as a builder, and in 1947 he married Bessie Carter, his childhood sweetheart. Carter was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Couch converted to that faith in 1949. ==Rugby union== A first five-eighth, Couch represented Wairarapa at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, from 1947 to 1949. He played seven matches for the All Blacks including three internationals. Of NgƒÅi Tahu and NgƒÅti Mutunga descent, he also played 20 matches for New Zealand MƒÅori between 1948 and 1950. ==Political career== In the 1975 general election, he was elected to Parliament as the National Party member of parliament for the Wairarapa electorate, thus becoming (with Rex Austin) only the second and third MƒÅori (after Sir James Carroll) to win a general electorate (as opposed to a MƒÅori electorate). He served as Minister of MƒÅori Affairs and Minister of Police in the third National Government, but lost his seat in 1984 to Labour's Reg Boorman. While Minister of Police, he called for the birch to be introduced for violent offenders and allowed the police to use longer batons. He created some controversy by wearing a Springbok rugby team blazer at the time of their 1981 tour of New Zealand as well as attending a public meeting organised by the League of Rights. This was despite his having been denied entry to South Africa as part of the All Blacks rugby team in the 1940s because of his race. In 1977, Couch was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1991 Queen's Birthday Honours, Couch was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. ==Later life and death== In the 1990s, Couch was involved in various MƒÅori organisations. He died in 1996 in Masterton. ==References== - Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for North Island electorates Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:New Zealand sportsperson-politicians Category:New Zealand Latter Day Saints Category:Converts to Mormonism from Methodism Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:MƒÅori All Blacks players Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:MƒÅori MPs Category:NgƒÅi Tahu Category:NgƒÅti Mutunga Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1987 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1984 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1972 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1963 New Zealand general election Category:Toastmasters members ","title":"Ben Couch"},{"id":"9099554","text":"The Lordsburg Hidalgo County Museum is located in Lordsburg, New Mexico.

This midrash describes in great detail the last acts of Moses and his death, at which the angels and God were present. There are several recensions of it, dating to between 7th and 11th centuries. The first, published at Constantinople in 1516Venice, 1544, and elsewhere; also in Adolf Jellinek, B. H. i. 115‚Äì129 begins with a brief exegesis by R. Samuel Na·∏•mani and R. Tanhuma of the first verse of the pericope \\"V'Zot HaBerachah\\" (Deuteronomy 33:1-34:12), closing with its last verses, and doubtless intended for Simhat Torah. In 1693, the Midrash was translated into yiddish by Aaron ben Samuel, leading to its popularization with women. == Contents of the Midrash == The real content of the midrash is an aggadic treatment of Deuteronomy 31:14 et seq., supplemented by an exegesis of Deuteronomy 3:23 et seq., and is filled with somewhat tedious dialogues between God and Moses, who is represented as unwilling to die. All his tears and entreaties were in vain, however; for God commanded all the princes of heaven to close the gates of prayer. In the last days of his life, until the 7th of Adar, Moses interpreted the Torah to Israel, and on the day of his death, according to Rabbi Helbo, he wrote thirteen Torahs, of which twelve were for the twelve tribes, and the best was for the Ark of the Covenant;Deuteronomy 31:24-30; comp. Pesikta Rabbati p. 197a; Deuteronomy Rabbah, Vayelech, end; Midrash Tehillim on Psalms 90 some say that the angel Gabriel descended, and took the Torah from the hands of Moses, bearing it through each heaven to show the piety of its scribe, and that the souls of the holy read from this Torah on Mondays and Thursdays and on festivals. This is followed by a long section beginning with R. Josiah's account of the honors which Moses rendered Joshua, and the service which he did him in the last days of his life. Especially noteworthy here is the poetic prayer of Joshua beginning ◊¢◊ï◊®◊ï ◊®◊†◊ï ◊©◊û◊ô ◊î◊©◊û◊ô◊ù ◊î◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù. After this the close of Moses' life is depicted, a bat kol (heavenly voice) giving warning with increasing insistence of the hours, even of the seconds, that remained for him. This enumeration of the hours and the conventional formula ◊ô◊¶◊™◊î ◊ë◊™ ◊ß◊ï◊ú are important for the determination of the dependence of the additions in Deuteronomy Rabbah 11 and the second recension on the original version. Early in the midrash the angels Gabriel and Zangaziel, \\"the scribe of all the sons of heaven,\\" are mentioned; but in the last hours of the life of Moses it is Samael, the head of the Satans, whose activity is most conspicuous as he watches for the passing of the soul, while Michael weeps and laments. At last Samael receives the command to bring the soul of Moses, but flees in terror before his glance. Again he appears with a drawn sword before Moses, but he has to yield before the \\"shem ha-meforash,\\" carved on the staff of the leader of Israel. The last moment approaches, however, and God Himself appears to receive Moses' soul. The three good angels accompany Him to prepare a resting-place for Moses, whose soul at length is taken in the kiss of death. == Other recensions == Large portions of this midrash are contained in Deuteronomy Rabbahed. Wilna, 11: 4, 7, 8, 9 (?), and 10 where they must be regarded as later additions. The entire passage represented by Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:9-10 is found also, combined in the same manner, in Yalkut ShimoniYalkut Shimoni, Deuteronomy, 940 (on Deuteronomy 31:14 where the Midrash Petirat Mosheh is given as the source. Sifre 305 contains an exquisite little aggadah on Moses and the angel of death.Compare Pesikta Rabbati p. 199b; Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:5 A long citation from the beginning of the midrash is also contained in a homily in TanhumaTanhuma, Vaetchanan, 6 (on Deuteronomy 3:26) on the same theme, the death of Moses. A second recension is based on Proberbs 31:39, and is considered by Adolf Jellinek, but probably incorrectly, to be the older. It was edited by himIn B. H. vi. 71-78 and has an entirely different beginning from that which is found in the other recension.Compare Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:3 As it is based upon a defective manuscript, the manner in which this introduction was connected with the original midrash can not be determined; but what follows the missing portion does not differ essentially from that found in the first recension, although it is somewhat shorter and is changed in arrangement. Moses' lament that he may never taste the fruits of the land receives a long explanatory addition to the effect that he grieved not for the products of the earth, but because he would be unable to fulfill the divine commands pertaining to the Land of Israel. A third recension or revision of the midrash was published by Gilbert Gaulmyn (Paris, 1692), together with a Latin language translation and the first recension. In the Assumptio Mosis the manuscript ends abruptly before the account of the assumption from which that work receives its name.

The word \\"battles\\"Battles, gigam.didli. is discernible on the subsequent, fragmentary line of the Chronicle and this has led some historians to believe Ilu-shuma may have engaged in conflict with his southerly neighbor. A brick inscription of Ilu- shuma describes his relations with the south and reads: The historian M. Trolle Larsen has suggested that this represented an attempt to lure traders from the south of Assur with tax privileges and exemptions, to monopolize the exchange of copper from the gulf for tin from the east. The cities cited therefore are the three major caravan routes the commodities would have traveled rather than campaign routes for the king. Ilu-shuma's construction activities included building the old temple of Ishtar, a city wall, subdivision of the city into house plots and diversion of the flow of two springs to the city gates Aushum and Wertum. Tukultƒ´-Ninurta I recorded that he preceded him by 720 years, on his own inscriptions commemorating his construction of an adjacent Ishtar temple. From this it might be deduced that, despite later being among the \\"kings whose year names are not known\\", the reign length of Ilu-shuma was still known in the time of Tukulti-Ninurta I to be 21 years.Cambridge Ancient History: Assyria 2060-1816 BC, 1966, p. 22. Larsen has suggested that he may have been a contemporary of Iddin-Dagan and Ishme-Dagan of Isin, which would clash with the synchronization with Sumu- abum, but make more sense given the current chronology favored. == See also == * Timeline of the Assyrian Empire * Early Period of Assyria * List of Assyrian kings * Assyrian continuity * Assyrian people * Assyria == Inscriptions == == Notes == == References == Category:19th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:19th-century BC rulers ","title":"Ilu-shuma"},{"id":"9099725","text":"William Kendall may refer to: *William Kendall (actor) (1903‚Äì1984), British actor, appeared in The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll *William Kendall (cricketer) (born 1973), English cricketer *William Sergeant Kendall (1869‚Äì1938), American painter *William Kendall (swimmer) (1916‚Äì2004), Australian swimmer *William Kendall (burgess 1657) (1621‚Äì1686), Virginia colonial politician, Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses *William Kendall (burgess 1688) (1659‚Äì1696), his son, Virginia colonial politician, Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses *Bill Kendall (ice hockey) (1910‚Äì1996), Canadian hockey player *Bill Kendall (trade unionist) (1923‚Äì2000), British trade union leader *William Kendall, character in The $5,000,000 Counterfeiting Plot *William M.

It was first published under the title \\"The Devious Bachelor\\" in Colliers in September 1953. The story is wholly told from the first-person perspective. ==Plot summary== Lionel Lampson, a wealthy middle-aged bachelor and art collector, learns from a gossipy widow, Gladys Ponsonby, that his younger girlfriend Janet de Pelagia thinks of him, among other things, as a \\"crashing bore\\". Lionel is scandalised and devises an elaborate revenge. He approaches a local artist, John Royden, and asks him to paint Janet's portrait with the stipulation that she does not know who has commissioned it. Gladys had confided in Lionel that Royden has an unusual method: he paints his subjects first nude and then, painting them several times again, adds every layer of clothing one at a time. When the portrait is completed, Lionel (who is skilled at restoring and cleaning paintings) removes all additional layers of paint, exposing Janet in her undergarments. He then stages a dinner party for Janet and some of society's elite, where, at the end of the candle-lit meal, the lights are suddenly turned on and the painting is revealed for all to see. Lionel leaves the room unobserved‚Äîthough not before seeing the stunned look on Janet's face‚Äîand slips away to his house in the country, basking in the success of his scheme until two days later, when he receives a telephone call from Gladys telling him he is now despised by all his former friends ‚Äì except her. But things get even worse: a few days later, Lionel receives a container of excellent caviar along with a letter from Janet, saying that she forgives him and still loves him. Lionel feels deeply ashamed. Not being able to resist his favorite food, he indulges himself and, by the end of the story, begins to feel violently ill. The implication is that Lionel has been poisoned, perhaps fatally, by Janet. ==Adaptation== The story was adapted for television, under the title \\"Depart in Peace\\", as an episode of Tales of the Unexpected. ==References== Category:Short stories by Roald Dahl Nunc Dimittis (short story) Category:Works originally published in Collier's ","title":"Nunc Dimittis (short story)"},{"id":"9099744","text":"The ruins of Woodstock House The Woodstock Estate is one kilometre outside the village of Inistioge in County Kilkenny, Ireland, on the west bank of the River Nore, which runs past it.

The house is still a ruin but the gardens are open to the public. ==History== Woodstock House is now a ruin. In 1737, William Fownes's grandfather left him over 21,000 acres. William Fownes father, (also) Sir William Fownes, had been the Mayor of Dublin. When the younger William married Elizabeth Ponsonby he received ¬£4,000 as a dowry. With this money William and Sarah built the six bayed three storey Woodstock House in County Kilkenny in 1745-7. They had a child guest named Sarah Ponsonby who was Elizabeth's cousin. When Sarah's adult friend, Lady Eleanor Butler, ran away from home she was hidden in Sarah's room and the housemaid Mary Carryl smuggled in food for her stowaway. Sarah was receiving unwanted attention from Sir William. but eventually they agreed that they could leave Ireland together. They went to Llangollen in Wales where they set up home in a cottage called Plas Newydd. Eleanor and Sarah became the Ladies of Llangollen with Mary Carryl as their lifelong servant. Mary Blachford Tighe (1772-1810) as sculpted by Lorenzo Bartolini ca. 1820. Over the next forty-five years, Woodstock was the background to a series of dramas that led to the deaths of William, Elisabeth and their son-in-law William Tighe. The Irish poet Mary Tighe died here of tuberculosis in 1820. The gardens and walks were laid out between 1840 and 1900 by another William Tighe and his wife Lady Louisa Lennox.Gardens in Inistioge - Woodland Walks - Formal Avenues - Wooded Valley - Co. Kilkenny The gardens contain many exotic plants from Asia and South America, including the Monkey Puzzle tree and the Noble Fir tree which form two of the walks in the gardens, as well as specimens of the Coast Redwood. In 1921, the property was occupied by the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, which caused resentment, and then by troops of the Free State Army, who were withdrawn from the premises during the Irish Civil War, on 1 July 1922. The house, left unguarded, was burnt down the next day, and remains a derelict empty shell, overgrown with vegetation. The grounds are being restored by Kilkenny County Council and are open to the public. In the grounds, near the river, is a shooting lodge called the Red House. In 1978 the estate hosted the Irish Jamboree, marking seventy years of Scouting in Ireland.

Later he studied at the University of Berlin and at the Rabbiner-Seminar (Berlin), marrying in 1905 Hannah the daughter of R' David Zvi Hoffmann, rector of the Seminar. In 1903, Marx accepted Solomon Schechter's invitation to teach history at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and be its librarian.

Marx contributed monographs and articles to journals on a wide variety of subjects, published two volumes of collected essays (Studies in Jewish History and Booklore (1944); Essays in Jewish Biography (1947)), and with Max L. Margolis wrote A History of the Jewish people (Jewish Publication Society of America, 1927, 1962). This pioneering work, stressed economic and social life, organization and legal status. It offers the reader a soundly researched, authoritative, and objective Jewish history in one volume.

The most common spacing used in competitions is , with larger competitions also featuring lines spaced at and .http://www.worldslalomseries.com/rules/ ==Equipment== Most freestyle slalomers use inline skates, although some use quad skates. Those who use inline skates tend to use a full rocker wheel configuration, however there are other variations of the rocker set-up which are used. Some skaters prefer to use a 'full hi-lo' rocker, which means the largest wheel is the second in from the back, with the smallest at the front. A common way to rocker your wheels is by putting larger wheels in the center and smaller wheels on each end. An example of this is having 80 mm wheels in the 2nd and 3rd position and 76 mm in the front and back. A short frame (230‚Äì245 mm) is used to give the skate the maximum possible maneuverability. Inline skates used for slalom have a very tight fit with a strong cuff, to give sustained ankle support. Popular skates used in the past include the FSK skate range by Salomon, now unavailable. The market is now arguably dominated by Seba skates, formed by a world class slalom skater; other brands such as Powerslide and RollerBlade also offer popular slalom skate models. ==List of slalom moves== The list of basic moves from easiest to hardest.

His family moved to Li√®ge, Belgium, in 1893.National Memorial Fort Breendonk Ochs studied art there at the Royal Academy of Art in Li√®ge, graduating in 1903. He won the Donnay Prize that year. Afterwards, he continued his studies at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris until 1905. Ochs volunteered for the army in World War I, and was seriously injured in an air attack. In 1920 he became a professor of painting at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Li√®ge, and in 1934 he was appointed Director of the city's Mus√©e des Beaux Arts. ==Fencing career== In addition to being a gifted artist, he was an Olympic fencing champion. He was Champion of Belgium in fencing in 1912. Ochs was a member of the Belgian fencing team at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, and won a gold medal in the team √©p√©e event (his teammates included Gaston Salmon). Ochs also competed in three individual events. In the individual foil and individual √©p√©e, he reached the 2nd round before being eliminated (he finished 39th in foil, and 29th in √©p√©e. Ochs's final event was individual sabre, but he was eliminated in the 1st round. ==Art and caricature== He was also a caricaturist, who published his sketches, illustrations, and caricatures in various newspapers including the French daily, Le Figaro, and a satirical magazine published in Brussels called Pourquoi Pas? (Why Not?). He at the same time worked at the newspapers \\"Newspaper of Liege\\", \\"Small Parisian\\", and \\"the Belgian Nation.\\" ==Arrest and internment== In early April 1938, Ochs, who was himself Jewish, depicted Hitler on the cover of Pourquoi Pas? with a swastika on his head and a sceptre in the form of a headless Jew. An artist with right-wing tendencies who envied Ochs' success informed on him, and Ochs was arrested at the Academy in Li√®ge on 17 November 1940.The Prisoners of Breendonk: Personal Histories from a World War II ... ‚Äì James M. Deem A month later, on 17 December, Ochs was imprisoned in the Fort Breendonk camp, to the south of Antwerp on the Brussels-Antwerp highway. The camp's prisoners suffered starvation, grass eating, tortures, hangings, and shootings.Concentration Camps List Since 20 September, Breendonk had been used as a police internment camp holding mostly political prisoners and foreign Jews before their transport to Germany. Ochs used caricature to document the life there, drawing portraits of his fellow inmates on paper. When the commandant, Sturmbannf√ºhrer Philipp Schmitt,Commandant's name and rank per Encyclopedia of the Holocaust entry on Breendonk, vol.1, p.242; revised spelling per German Wikipedia page. who was very proud of \\"his\\" camp, became aware of Ochs' artistic talents, he ordered him to make him drawings of the camp and its inmates ‚Äì a gallery of victims. Among them was a portrait of Antwerp's shochet (Jewish ritual slaughterer). Immediately after his arrival, Breziner's hair had been shaved off, and he looked humiliated. Ochs was obliged to obey the demands of the SS, but tried to ease the suffering of his fellow inmates. He would drag out their portrait \\"sittings\\" to provide them with as much rest as possible. Professor Paul L√©vy, who today serves as the president of the M√©morial National du Fort de Breendonk, and was interned with Ochs, has said that although the inmates did not have mirrors, they knew what they looked like through Ochs' works. A Flemish SS man who had known Ochs previously succeeded in smuggling him out of the camp in February 1942. This same man was also able to smuggle out some of the drawings Ochs had made for Commandant Schmitt. In 1944 Ochs was re- arrested and interned again, along with his sister, in Mechelen transit camp. He continued to draw and managed to avoid deportation through a \\"medical\\" opinion confirming he had been baptised as a Protestant, and so could not be Jewish. He was liberated from the camp by the British forces. ==After World War II== Only a small number of the characters he drew survived. After the war, Ochs used his drawings to reconstruct scenes from the camp. He published these in 1947, in a book called Breendonck ‚Äì Bagnards et Bourreaux (\\"Breendonck ‚Äì Slave Laborers and Hangmen\\"). SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Schmitt, the commandant of Breedonck camp and, later, of Mechelen transit camp, was tried in Antwerpen in 1950 and sentenced to death. He was the only SS man sentenced in Belgium, and his was the last execution before the country abolished the death penalty. After the war Ochs returned to work as a lecturer in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and even though his sight had been damaged during his internment, he continued to paint and draw. In 1948 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium and a member of the Commission d'Achat des Mus√©es Royaux d'Art Moderne [Acquisitions Commission of the Royal Museums of Modern Art]. He exhibited in many exhibitions, among them group exhibitions of the \\"Circle of Fine Arts\\", and a retrospective exhibition was also held for him. Ochs received many awards in recognition of his artistic talents, among them a gold medal at the second Biennale in Menton [M√©daille d'or de la deuxi√®me Biennale de Menton] in 1953, and a gold medal for art, science and letters in Paris [M√©daille d'or des Arts, Sciences et Lettres, Paris] in 1959. ==Death== Ochs died in Liege in 1971, 88 years old. A number of his drawings from Mechelen were donated to the art collection of Beit Lohamei Haghetaot (the Ghetto Fighters' House Museum)The GFH Mission by Ir√®ne Awret, who was interned with him in this camp. ==See also== * List of select Jewish fencers ==References== ==External links== * bio * Holocaust through Art bio * Jews in Sports bio Category:Belgian male fencers Category:Belgian √©p√©e fencers Category:Belgian foil fencers Category:Jewish fencers Category:Jewish Belgian sportspeople Category:1971 deaths Category:Alumni of the Acad√©mie Julian Category:Members of the Royal Academy of Belgium Category:Olympic fencers of Belgium Category:Fencers at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Belgium Category:Olympic medalists in fencing Category:Belgian caricaturists Category:Belgian military personnel of World War I Category:Breendonk concentration camp survivors Category:1883 births Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Nice Category:Belgian Jews Category:Belgian people of French descent Category:20th-century Belgian painters ","title":"Jacques Ochs"},{"id":"9099977","text":"is a professional Go player. ==Biography== Masaki Hoshino became a professional in 1985.

Three genera are known, one quite recently described.(Kobes and Ronkay, 1990). One species, \\"Shisa\\" excellens, was originally placed in the Lymantriidae.(Owada, 1993; Holloway, 1998: 9). The moths are large with rounded wings and strongly spotted wing patterns, and \\"pectinate\\" antennae. The relationships of this group to other Cossoidea needs reassessment, once suitable samples are available, with molecular data. ==Distribution== About 13 relictually distributed species are restricted to Southeast Asia, occurring in Borneo, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, northeastern Himalayas, and Taiwan.Holloway, 1986: 41-42; Heppner and Wang, 1987; Heynderycx, 2003 ==Behaviour== The adults are very rarely found, feeble-flying, and occasionally are attracted to light, but more likely to be found flying by day.(Holloway, 1986: 41-42). ==Conservation== These large moths are so incredibly rarely found and their habitats under such massive threat from large-scale conversion of rainforest in Southeast Asia that their conservation status should be seriously considered and dedicated surveys conducted to assess their distribution and biology. One species (Ratarda melanoxantha) is probably protected by virtue of its occurrence in Mount Kinabalu National Park on Borneo, where it was found once.(Holloway, 1986). ==References== *Edwards, E.D., Gentili, P., Horak, M., Kristensen, N.P. and Nielsen, E.S.

Panum Crater is between 600 and 700 years old, and it exhibits all of the characteristics of the textbook rhyolitic lava dome. Rhyolitic volcanoes are characterized by having large amounts of silica (quartz) in their lava. The content of silica at Panum is about 76 percent. It makes the lava very viscous, or thick, and very glassy. Products of this rhyolitic eruption are pumice and obsidian, the volcanic glass that Native Americans used to make arrow points and scrapers. Panum Crater formed in a sequence of events. The first event was caused by magma rising from deep within the Earth's crust. When this extremely hot, liquid rock made contact with water just below the surface, the water expanded into steam and a large, violent eruption occurred. The material that was thrown into the air by the steam, mainly old lake bottom sediments, was deposited around the new vent in little mounds. So much debris was blown out that a gaping crater was left behind. Once this debris was blown out, a fountain of cinders shot up a great distance into the sky. As this huge amount of ash and pumice began to fall back towards the earth, it formed a pumice ring, or cinder cone, about the original vent. This cinder cone is still visible today. Following the violent eruptions of the first two phases, the remainder of the thick magma slowly rose to the surface in a series of domes. Each dome began with an outpouring of the viscous, rhyolitic lava which hardened and formed a cap over the vent. As magma continued to push up, the cap (or dome) shattered and fell to the outside of the newly formed dome. This happened so many times that a new mountain was created out of these broken pieces, called crumble breccia. The mountain continued to build in this manner until the force within the volcano weakened and no more new domes formed. The final one still stands today. As the final dome hardened, a period of spire building began. Thick lava pushed up through cracks of the hardening dome and formed castle-like spires. The formation of the spires was analogous to toothpaste squeezing through the opening of a tube and forming a small tower before it topples over. Most of the spires at Panum fell over and broke because of their rapid cooling and because of many small explosions at their bases. Most of the rocky debris at the top of the dome is the remains of spires that have crumbled. Flow banding in the obsidian dome The central lava dome was erupted from degassed material and is made up of pumice and obsidian of the same composition. The difference between the two has to do with gas escaping as the magma cooled. The magma that created the dome had dissolved gas in it, like a bottle of seltzer water. As the magma rose towards the surface where there was less pressure on it than at depth, the gas expanded producing the holes or bubbles in the pumice. The magma that remained pressurized while it cooled quickly or that had already lost its gas, formed the obsidian. Flow banding containing both obsidian and pumice is common at Panum Crater. Another common texture, called breadcrust, can also be seen in the dome. Breadcrust textures form when the inside of a cooling rock is still hot with gas escaping from it while the outside surface has already cooled. As the gas expands from the inside, the outside surface cracks to allow the gas to escape. ==References== * * Category:Volcanoes of Mono County, California Category:Landforms of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Lava domes Category:Volcanoes of California Category:Cinder cones of the United States ","title":"Panum Crater"},{"id":"9100028","text":"Psalm 90 is the 90th psalm from the Book of Psalms.

The club's owners, Dwain Kyles and Calvin Hollins, were later convicted of criminal contempt for their persistent failure to keep the facility up to code, and sentenced to two years in prison. ==Incident== The stampede was triggered by club security using pepper spray to break up a fight. Several patrons close to the commotion experienced vomiting or fainting from the spray's noxious fumes. Coupled with panic from others unaware of the source of the smell, the crowd rushed towards the exits. According to witnesses, many believed the club had been hit with poison gas in a terrorist attack. The only known exit was the steep front stairwell leading to the main entrance on the ground floor, but its narrow doors opened inward, which was a fire code violation. Additionally, while the doors were normally kept open during business hours, they had been closed after the fight participants were ejected. Although at least one emergency exit was opened by a security guard, there were disputed reports of another chained shut. As the evacuating crowd pushed open the doors, several people already climbing the stairs were knocked down and subsequently pinned by the ensuing crush. Security attempted to pull them to safety, but the pile rapidly reached six feet in height as a result of more than 1,500 simultaneously attempting to escape the chaos inside. Ira Navarro, a former E2 guard who had worked at trying to free trapped patrons, recalled to the Chicago Sun-Times in January 2007 that he had heard other clubbers atop the stairs laughing at the fracas, unaware of the fatalities stemming from the ground-floor pileup.Some laughed in E2 stampede: Patrons did not know they were shoving others to their deaths ‚Äì Chicago Sun-Times, 1/19/07; reprinted on highbeam.com 21 patrons ‚Äì twelve women and nine men, between the ages of 21 and 43 ‚Äì were pronounced dead from compressional asphyxiation, and more than 50 others were injured.All E2 victims were crushed ‚Äì Chicago Tribune, 1/26/2007 ==Aftermath== There were a number of controversies associated with the case.

During the trial in January 2007, the prosecution claimed that the club's security staff were improperly trained to handle rowdy crowds. E2 security guard Samuel Bone testified to using the pepper spray to disband a group of fifteen brawling clubbers, which had stopped the fight and led to the instigator leaving the premises. He then said that he was indeed trained in the proper use of pepper spray by the Illinois Police Reserve Patrol, a nonprofit group.Bouncer describes E2 crowd: Guard says he used pepper spray in fight ‚Äì Chicago Tribune, 1/23/07; reprinted on highbeam.com On November 25, 2009, Kyles and Hollins were acquitted of involuntary manslaughter charges, but were found guilty of indirect criminal contempt for violating the previous orders to close the entire second floor of the club and were sentenced to two years in prison.E2 Owners Get 2 Years In Prison ‚Äì WBBM, 11/25/09 E2 and Epitome both permanently closed after the incident.E2 Stampede Remembered Six Years Later ‚Äì NBC Chicago, 2/2009 On November 16, 2011, the previous rulings were overturned when a judge ruled that the orders to close down the second floor were ambiguous.

The original church at Fourth Street & Howard Avenue was built by the parishioners themselves, many of whom were skilled stonemasons and carpenters. With the influx of German Catholic immigrants into Schuylkill County, the parish soon increased tremendously. In 1869, construction on the present church began, and it was finished in 1872.

There are many variants. The cheese is commonly grated Gruy√®re, Comt√©, or Emmentaler,Daniel Young, The Bistros, Brasseries, and Wine Bars of Paris, p. 20. .Larousse Gastronomique, 1988 edition, 2001 translation. . but there are many variants using other cheeses or other ingredients. Goug√®res are said to come from Burgundy, particularly the town of Tonnerre in the Yonne department.Larousse Gastronomique, 1st edition Goug√®res can be made as small pastries, in diameter; aperitif goug√®res, ; individual goug√®res; or in a ring. Sometimes they are filled with ingredients such as mushrooms, beef, or ham; in this case the goug√®re is usually made using a ring or pie tin. In Burgundy, they are generally served cold when tasting wine in cellars, but are also served warm as an appetizer. This delicate dish is best for special celebrations, such as parties. ==History== While the term currently refers specifically to savory choux pastries, eighteenth and nineteenth century records suggest that it was once an umbrella term for a number of preparations, some composed of just cheese, eggs, and breadcrumbs.Pierre Larousse, Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle, 1872, s.v. goug√®re, though this may be an error The presentation was usually a flat circle, neither a sphere nor a ring.No√´l Chomel, Dictionnaire Oeconomique: Contenant Divers Moyens D'Augmenter Son Bien, Et De Conserver Sa Sant√© Google BooksPrudence Boissi√®re, Dictionnaire analogique de la langue fran√ßaise: r√©pertoire complet des mots par les id√©es et des id√©es par les mots, 1862 Google Books Earlier forms of goug√®re were more a stew than a pastry, including herbs, bacon, eggs, cheese, spices, and meat mixed with an animal's blood, and prepared in a sheep's stomach. In medieval France, it was a kind of cheese tart or pie. Later, it was unknown outside what is now Belgium, where it became associated with Palm Sunday.Fr√©d√©ric Eug√®ne Godefroy, Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue fran√ßaise et de tous ses dialectes du ixe au xve si√®cle, 1885 Google Books But it was also attested in Auxerre (Burgundy) in the 19th century under the name gouere.Jean-Baptiste de La Curne, Dictionnaire historique de l'ancien langage fran√ßois, 1879 Google Books ==Name== The word goug√®re was formerly spelled gouiere, gouyere,Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise, s.v. goug√®re go√Ø√®re, goy√®re, or gouy√®re.

Made of silver grey plastic, it had a black matte area around the keyboard area. Most of the 63 rubber chiclet keys were grey, with some (the more important) keys in marine blue, and with white control and break keys. Each of the grey keys could produce any of five inputs: Upper and lower-case letters (or numbers and symbols), two graphic characters (similar to the graphic symbols of PETSCII), and a BASIC keyword. Two keys, ALPHA and GRAPH, are used to switch back and forth between character and graphics modes. Holding down the CONTROL key while pressing any grey key produced a Basic keyword. In total the JR-200 had 253 built-in characters. 96 letters, numbers and symbols, 5 Greek letters, 63 graphical symbols, 79 Japanese (katakana) symbols and 10 music and other symbols. All symbols formed in an 8x8 pixel matrix, and the JR-200 could display 32 characters per line and 24 lines. All relevant keys would auto-repeat when pressed continuously. The JR-200 used a very unusual 8-bit CPU, the MN1800A, which was compatible with the Motorola MC6802, a slightly improved version of the Motorola 6800. It ran at a slow 0.89 MHz (according to unconfirmed information). There is also a second processor, the 4-bit MN1544CJR, which is used for I/O and contains 128 bytes of RAM plus four kilobytes of ROM. ==JR-Basic== The JR-200 did not use Microsoft BASIC, but its own dialect, one that was designed to be mostly compatible with Microsoft BASIC. JR-BASIC was a greatly extended Basic, with, (for example) graphical commands such as COLOR, (which selected character color, background color and display mode) and PLOT which permitted direct addressing of the low resolution graphics mode (64√ó48, using text semigraphics characters, which represented pixel blocks that used one-quarter of each character). Eight colors were available for the background and foreground use: blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow, white and black. By re-programming a part of the character-set a limited high resolution graphics mode was achievable with a resolution of 256√ó192. The basic also supported on-screen editing and direct execution of basic instructions. the machine came with 32K of RAM, and had 30,716 bytes free for a Basic program. User memory could be expanded to 40K. JR-Basic itself occupied 16K of ROM, while the character set video memory and I/O used another 6K. The JR-200 ROM also contained a machine code monitor to enter and execute machine code programs. ==Sound== The JR-200 was capable of producing a wide range of sounds. The JR-200 had a general purpose timer - I/O chip, with three of the timer outputs being hooked up to generate square wave tones. The Basic supported the sound capabilities with commands ranging from a simple BEEP command (BEEP 1 producing an 880 Hz \\"middle octave A\\" sound), to the SOUND (f, d) command which took two numerical parameters for frequency and duration, and the PLAY and TEMPO commands which could take multiple commands to play a tone over a 5-octave range, and played them in the background while the Basic program continued. Clever use of the three square wave voices could be used to generate a range of other sounds, such as explosions. A keystroke could be accompanied by an audible feedback signal. Audio was output from an RCA (Tulip) connector onto which an eight ohm speaker could be directly connected, but the JR-200 also had a small built-in speaker. On the back of the device there was a volume control potentiometer that controlled both the internal and external speaker. ==I/O connectors== On the back of the device you could also find an eight-pin DIN connector for a cassette recorder with which you could load programs at 2400 bit/s. Then two connectors for video output, an RCA connector RF output and an eight-pins DIN connector that could output NTSC or RGB video. The JR-200UP variant outputs composite PAL and RGB. Two other connectors provided a centronics compatible printer port, (supported by Basic with LPRINT, LLIST and HCOPY, a \\"screen dump\\" command) and an expansion interface port. The expansion port connector also had signal lines for an RS232 serial connection which Basic supported with several commands, but its main use was to connect a 5¬º-inch floppy disk drive. On its left side the JR-200 had two DB-9 joystick connectors which could be connected to standard (Atari style) joysticks, which could be read by the Basic STICK command.

The book is a critique of the Young Hegelians and their trend of thought, which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the Bauer Brothers and their supporters. The book created a controversy with much of the press and caused Bruno Bauer to refute the book in an article which was published in Wigand's Vierteljahrsschrift in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was saying. Marx later replied to his response with his own article that was published in the journal Gesellschaftsspiegel in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of The German Ideology. ==History== During Engels' short stay in Paris (1844), Marx suggested that they should write together a critique of the rage of their day, the Young Hegelians. While accomplishing their plan, the first joint writing project between the two men was accomplished and thus the beginning of their friendship. After conversing, they began drawing up plans for a book about the Young Hegelian trend of thought very popular in academic circles. Agreeing to co-author the Foreword, they divided up the other sections. Engels finished his assigned chapters before leaving Paris. Marx had the larger share of work, and he completed it by the end of November 1844. (Marx would draw from his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, on which he had been working the spring and summer of 1844.) The foremost title line‚Äî\\"The Holy Family\\"‚Äîwas added at the suggestion of the book publisher Lowenthal. It is a sarcastic reference to the Bauer brothers (Bruno and Edgar) and their supporters amongst the Hegelians who had attempted a critical renovation of Christianity, hence the subtitle a \\"Critique of Critical Critique.\\" Later Marx will continue this sarcasm by referring to them as Saint Bruno, Saint Max (Stirner), etc. The book made something of a splash in the newspapers. One paper noted that it expressed socialist views since it criticized the \\"inadequacy of any half-measures directed at eliminating the social ailments of our time.\\" The conservative press immediately recognized the radical elements inherent in its many arguments. One paper wrote that, in The Holy Family, \\"every line preaches revolt... against the state, the church, the family, legality, religion and property.\\" It also noted that \\"prominence is given to the most radical and the most open communism, and this is all the more dangerous as Mr. Marx cannot be denied either extremely broad knowledge or the ability to make use of the polemical arsenal of Hegel's logic, what is customarily called 'iron logic.'\\" ==External links== *Complete German text (Die Heilige Familie) *Complete English text (The Holy Family or Critique of Critical Criticism.

Originally described as Galerula cyanopus by American mycologist George Francis Atkinson in 1918. It was transferred to Conocybe by Robert K√ºhner in 1935 before being transferred to Pholiotina by Rolf Singer in 1950. A 2013 molecular phylogenetics study found it to belong to a group of species currently assigned to Pholiotina that are more closely related to Galerella nigeriensis than to Pholiotina or Conocybe. It is likely that it will be moved to a different genus in the future, but this has not happened yet. It is very similar to Pholiotina smithii, a species known only from North America, from which it differs slightly in the color of its cap and gills and the width of its cheilocystidia. Some authors have speculated that the P. smithii could be a junior synonym of P. cyanopus, but this has not been confirmed. ==Description== Pholiotina cyanopus is a small saprotrophic mushroom with a conic to broadly convex cap which is smooth and colored ocher to cinnamon brown. It is usually less than 25 mm across and the margin is striate, often with fibrous remnants of the partial veil. The gills are adnate and close, colored cinnamon brown with whitish edges near the margin, darkening in age. The spores are cinnamon brown, smooth and ellipsoid with a germ pore, measuring 8 √ó 5 micrometers. The stem is smooth and fragile, whitish at the bottom and brownish at the top, 2‚Äì4 cm long, 1 to 1.5 mm thick, and is equal width for most of the length, often swelling at the base. The stem lacks an annulus (ring) and the base usually stains blue. The cap color lightens when it dries, turning a tan color. Like some other grassland species such as Psilocybe semilanceata, Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe tampanensis, Conocybe cyanopus may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the organism, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. ==Distribution and habitat== Pholiotina cyanopus grows in lawns, fields, and grassy areas in temperate areas of North America, Europe and Asia. It can be found in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United States. It has also been reported from the United Kingdom but these reports are doubtful. Within Canada, it has been found in British Columbia and Quebec. Within the United States, it has been found in Colorado, Michigan, New York, Oregon and Washington) Within Russia, it has been found in the Sakha Republic and the Sikhote-Alin mountains and . It is rare where it occurs. ==Edibility== Pholiotina cyanopus is hallucinogenic, containing psilocin, psilocybin, baeocystin, norbaeocystin and aeruginascin. Paul Stamets stated in 1996 that fruit bodies of P. cyanopus have been found to contain anywhere from 0.33 to 1.01% (of dry weight) psilocybin, 0‚Äì0.007% psilocin, and 0.12‚Äì0.20% baeocystin. A more recent study found a collection of P. cyanopus from Poland to contain 0.90¬±0.08% psilocybin, 0.17¬±0.01% psilocin, 0.16¬±0.01% baeocystin, 0.053¬±0.004% norbaeocystin and 0.011¬±0.0007% aeruginascin. Most mycologists recommend against eating this mushroom because it is easy to mistake for deadly poisonous species e.g. pholiotina rugosa, cortinarius gentilis, galerina marginata or galerina padulosa ==Legality== The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P. cyanopus, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, there is a great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms and the spores of these mushrooms.

It was originally developed by Alesis but has since become widely accepted,Robjohns, H. 2007. Digital Interfacing. Sound on Sound. Volume 22, Issue 4, p.105. with many third party hardware manufacturers including Lightpipe interfaces on their equipment. The protocol has become so popular that the term \\"ADAT\\" is now often used to refer to the transfer standard rather than to the Alesis Digital Audio Tape itself. ==Cables and interface== Lightpipe uses the same connection hardware as S/PDIF: fiber optic cables (hence its name) to carry data, with Toslink connectors and optical transceivers at either end. However, the data streams of the two protocols are incompatible. S/PDIF is mostly used for transferring stereo or multi-channel surround sound audio, whereas the ADAT optical interface supports up to 8 audio channels at 48 kHz, 24 bit. Lightpipe devices have been successfully interfaced via FireWire.M-Audio ProFire Lightbridge, an example of a Lightpipe wireless interfacing implementation ==Data transfer== Lightpipe can carry eight channels of uncompressed digital audio at 24 bit resolution at 48,000 samples or four channels at 96,000 samples per second. Initially used for the transfer of digital audio between ADATs, the protocol was designed with future improvements in mind. All Lightpipe signals are transmitted at 24 bit resolution, no matter what the depth of the audio; information is contained within the Most Significant Bits and the rest of the bits remain a string of zeros. For example, if a 16 bit signal is sent via Lightpipe, the first sixteen bits contain the audio information while the other eight are simply occupied by zeros. The receiving device ignores information it cannot process. For example, a 20 bit signal going from a Type II ADAT to a Type I (which only operates at 16 bits) will simply ignore the bits below the sixteen MSBs.Alesis. 199?. ADAT LX20 Reference Manual. Chapter 8, p.52. Available online: . Accessed 24 August 2007 Higher sample rates can be accommodated with a reduced number of channels. While the original ADAT machines did not support this, the Lightpipe format was modified using bit- splitting techniques by the company Sonorus. Known as S/MUX (short for 'sample multiplexing'), this connection allows 4 channels at up to 96 kHz, or two channels at up to 192 kHz, on one optical cable. Most manufacturers implementing ADAT Lightpipe now support this S/MUX interface extension.Digital Interfacing Sound on Sound. Light carrying the data signal through the Lightpipe is turned into an electronic data stream going to an IC chip commonly referred to at Alesis as \\"the 1-K chip\\". From there the audio data frame is routed to processing IC's. With an ADAT Lightpipe and an ADAT controller linking up to four ADAT's using CAT5 cables with RJ-connectors and SMPTE Time Code, you could synchronize four 8-track ADATs together for a total of 32 simultaneous synchronized channel tracks of 16 or 20 bit audio data. 24 bit came later with the HD24 Hard Disk recorder in early 2001, which also made use of Lightpipe capabilities.Former ADAT service technician from Alesis ==Advantages== The lightpipe is \\"hot-pluggable\\", which means devices do not need to be turned off for plugging in or unplugging (although it is advisable to mute the receiving equipment, since there will be a large signal spike when the connection is made). The optical connect avoids ground-loops, which can be troublesome in larger installations, and will not transfer any harmful electrical spikes from one device to the next. ==Use in ADAT systems== Lightpipe was designed for use with the Alesis ADATs, and although extremely versatile, there are a few limitations. For straightforward digital audio transfer, the receiving device can synchronize to the lightpipe's embedded clock signal, achieving a 1:1 digital copy. For transport control, additional synchronization is needed between devices. (For example, using two ADAT machines at the same time to achieve 16-channel throughput would require better transport control; otherwise, the two ADAT machines would be very unlikely to play in sync.) Nine pin D connectors are used to transfer transport information. The Alesis ADAT HD24 also offers MIDI Time Code for synchronization with MIDI-enabled devices. ==Lightpipe bitstream== In order to fit 8 channels within the bandwidth limits of the standard TOSLINK transceiver modules, the bitstream is not biphase mark coded like S/PDIF. Instead, NRZI coding is used, where a 0 bit indicates no transition and a 1 bit is a transition. 8 audio samples at 24 bits per sample plus 4 user bits (196 bits total) are sent in groups of 4 data bits followed by a 1 bit to force a transition. This totals 196√ó5/4 = 245 bits. 10 consecutive 0 bits followed by a 1 bit provide frame synchronization.ADAT project, ACKspace wiki One frame is sent at the desired sample rate, for a bit rate of 256√ó48 kHz = 12.288 Mbit/s. This is twice the baud rate used by S/PDIF (3.072 Mbit/s, doubled by biphase coding to 6.144 Mbaud), but still within the specified 15 Mbaud capacity of the popular TOTX147 /TORX147 TOSLINK transceivers.

The most commonly used professional interface is AES3, developed by the Audio Engineering Society and the European Broadcasting Union, which transmits two channels of digital audio up to 24-bits over a balanced XLR cable. S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) is the consumer version of this protocol, which uses either RCA leads or optical cables identical to lightpipe cables.

It was the southern terminal of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad from 1843 to 1899, and briefly hosted a steamboat connection with the Long Island Rail Road. Patrick Kato owned this steamboat from 1945 to 1997. The Thames River frequently froze on its northern end, preventing steamboats from accessing the port at Norwich. To solve this problem, the railroad extended their line six miles to Allyn's Point, where freezing is less common, in 1843. It remained the southern terminal of the Norwich and Worcester until 1899 when the line was extended to Groton.

In recent years additional standards have been added for Electronic Funds Transfer. Formed in 1992 by a group of oil, pump and computer companies (including AGIP, BP, Petrofina, Mobil and Texaco), the principle of IFSF is to create standards so that devices from different manufacturers can interoperate without having to redevelop interfaces: IFSF Management Intro, sec 1.1 Background history A similar effort was undertaken earlier in Germany by oil companies and the Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt, resulting in the European Petrol Station Interface (‚ÄúEPSI‚Äù) standard, but this was not used much outside Germany. Standards are only available to paid members of the IFSF organisation. == Impact and deployment == IFSF forecourt equipment has seen considerable success in Europe and some growth markets like Russia and Eastern Europe, but is relatively rare elsewhere. It has not seen much usage in North America,http://www.pcats.org/website/navdispatch.asp?id=752 PCATS press release although several member companies are based there. However, additional members have continued to join IFSF from many countries, in particular Shell who has pushed IFSF heavily in their European operations. Typically most major manufacturers offer an IFSF version of their equipment, though it may not be widely deployed. During 2007 IFSF was promoted heavily in China.http://www.ifsf.org/ifsf-china.aspx The newer EFT standards, \\"POS-EPS\\" based on XML technologies, are being used more widely.http://www.csdecisions.com/issue/article/42265/pcats_and_bp_pursue_processing_standards.aspx Where IFSF is not used, a large variety of proprietary protocols are used. In many deployments, existing site equipment is converted to IFSF operation using a \\"protocol converter\\" or PCD, a small computer that accepts IFSF protocol and communicates to the device using its native, proprietary protocol. The PCD is most commonly fitted inside each dispenser, although it is possible for a single converter to convert many devices. == How IFSF works == IFSF is more complex but more comprehensive than most proprietary protocols. The IFSF protocol has two independent layers; a device application protocol layer and a communications protocol layer. The application protocol is independent of the underlying communications layer. The communications protocol specification makes the link to the transport layer. At the communication layer, LonWorks has been predominantly deployed because existing cables and cabling topology can be reused. Methods have been defined to use TCP/IP, but this requires higher specification cable and a point to point topology, and is therefore more suited to green field or rebuild service stations; in practice it is relatively rare. The IFSF standards define messages sent and received by each type of device. The messages are designed to be expandable by specifying individual fields with types and lengths. The messages are grouped into various \\"databases\\" for the logical parts of each device, such as a nozzle at a pump. Each type of device (dispenser, tank level gauge, price sign, carwash, etc.) defines its own set of databases and fields. Most devices also define a state machine to control the operation of the device. For example, the Dispenser device has the following states: * Inoperative (during startup) * Closed (not allowed to sell fuel, but otherwise working) * Idle (normal operating state) ** Authorised (nozzle in, but authorised for the next delivery of fuel) * Calling (nozzle out, not yet authorised) * Started (nozzle out and authorised, but no fuel flowing yet) ** Suspended started (paused, before fuel flow) * Fuelling (fuel flowing) ** Suspended fuelling (paused, during fuel flow) == References == == External links == * IFSF Home Page Category:Standards organisations in the United Kingdom ","title":"International Forecourt Standards Forum"},{"id":"9100609","text":"Bite Me! is a 2004 horror film written and directed by Brett Piper and starring Misty Mundae, Julian Wells, Rob Monkiewicz, and Erika Smith.

It consisted of a railroad journey between Boston and Fall River, Massachusetts, where passengers would then board steamboats for the journey through Narragansett Bay and Long Island Sound to the line's own Hudson River dock in Manhattan. For many years, it was the preferred route to take for travel between the two major cities. The line was extremely popular, and its steamboats were some of the most advanced and luxurious of their day. ==Origins== The origins of the Fall River Line can be traced back to Colonel Richard Borden, a businessman from Fall River who had established his fortune in the iron and textile industries. He had operated steamboats between Fall River and Providence as early as 1827. In 1846 Richard Borden completed the Fall River Railroad, which enabled a land route between Fall River and other cities such as Taunton, New Bedford, Providence and Boston. A direct rail line to South Braintree would also be added. Observing the success of the steamboat line which ran between New York and Stonington, Connecticut, Richard Borden began regular steamboat service between New York City and Fall River in 1847, establishing the Bay State Steamboat Company, with its first steamer, the Bay State. The following year, the Empire State was launched. The Fall River Line was an immediate success. By 1850, it had paid six percent dividends per month, for ten consecutive months. In 1854, the Metropolis was added. In 1863 the line was sold to the Boston, Newport and New York Steamboat Company, and the railroad was extended between Fall River and Newport, Rhode Island. For a short period after this, the rail connection was made at Newport for the trip to Boston. During this period, the new steamers the Old Colony and the Newport were added to the fleet. This was also a time of increased competition from other steamboat lines to New York City, including the Neptune Line to Providence as well as the Stonington Line. For a short time, Bristol, Rhode Island was also used as the ending point of the boat journey from New York. In 1867, two new steamers, the Bristol and the Providence, were introduced. Jim Fisk became president of the company, and would declare himself \\"admiral\\". In 1869 the line was sold to the Narragansett Steamboat Company.Rhode Island Historical Society With Fisk still president, he returned the line's terminus to Fall River, where it would remain until the line's demise in 1937, although there were several winters where the connection through Narragansett Bay was not possible due to ice, so Newport was used instead. ==Maturity== The Pilgrim In 1872 the Fall River Line was completely reorganized and became part of the Old Colony Railroad, under the name Old Colony Steamboat Company. In 1883, the Pilgrim was launched. The first modern liner of the fleet, she featured a double-hull for increased safety, was 370 feet long, and had sleeping quarters for 1,200 passengers. At the time of its launch it was the largest steamboat in the world. The Pilgrim could make the 176 mile trip between Fall River and New York in about 8.5 hours. The Puritan was added in 1889, and would serve the line until 1908 when the Commonwealth was introduced. In 1894, the Fall River Line launched the Priscilla, which at the time was the largest side- wheeler afloat, capable of accommodating 1,500 passengers. Maritime historian Roger Williams McAdam referenced the ships as \\"floating palaces.\\" The interiors of the vessels were extremely ornate and luxurious. Introduced in 1908, the Commonwealth was the largest of the fleet, at 455 feet in length. She provided 425 staterooms for passengers and boasted a grand staircase, a dining saloon, writing room, and a dance floor. During its history, the Fall River Line was travelled by several U.S. presidents including Grant, Harrison, Cleveland and both Roosevelts, as well as dignitaries such as the Vanderbilts, Astors, Belmonts and Rockefellers. One Boston editor declared, \\"If you went on a trip to New York and didn't travel the Fall River Line, you simply didn't go at all.\\" Although much of high society traveled with the Fall River Line, the middle class were also able to experience the gilded age of travel that the line had to offer. The romantic aspect of the ocean voyage was the subject of a popular 1913 song called \\"On the Old Fall River Line.\\" ==Decline== The Fall River Line's Ferry depot at Pier 14 on the Hudson River, 1938 vertical beam (i.e. walking beam) engine ever constructed. In 1889, the Thames River railroad drawbridge opened at New London, Connecticut, enabling direct, through rail service between Boston and New York City for the first time, marking the first serious threat to the existence of the Line. In 1893, the Fall River Line became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad upon its lease of the entire Old Colony Railroad network. In 1906, the line became a division of the New England Navigation Company. The affordability of the railroad and the onset of the mainstream automobile, as well as the creation of the Cape Cod Canal were also factors that the Fall River Line could not grow to withstand. After its employees went on strike in the middle of 1937, the company chose, in the face of ongoing losses due to land transportation, to liquidate rather than negotiate with the union. The remaining vessels (Plymouth, Priscilla, Providence and Commonwealth) fetched only 88,000 dollars when put up for sale. They were towed to Baltimore and were scrapped. The freighter Taunton was simply scuttled on the southeastern coast of Somerset, Massachusetts, in full view of its former pier. It can still be seen today.

A preeminent practitioner of \\"socialist realism\\", Reshetnikov was recognized by the government for his work and was a member for three and a half decades of the Soviet Academy of Arts. His creations are held in Russia's finest collections, including the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), the Russian Museum (Saint Petersburg), the State Historical Museum (Moscow), and others. ==Early life== Reshetnikov was born in Sursko- Litovskoe village in what is now Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, into a family of icon painters. Orphaned at an early age, Reshetnikov was raised by his brother, who painted church frescoes and icons for a living, and who employed Reshetnikov as an apprentice. Having never attended secondary school, Reshetnikov enrolled in a remedial \\"Rabfak\\" institution as preparation for attending Moscow's elite art college VKHUTEIN. ==Arctic expeditions== While still an art student, Reshetnikov's prowess in realist representation got him a position as resident \\"artistic reporter\\" on two arctic expeditions in 1932-34 with famous explorer Otto Schmidt on the Sibiryakov and on the doomed Chelyuskin. Reshetnikov was one of the people rescued from the ice after the Chelyuskin sank. ==Artistic career== Beginning in the late 1940s, Reshetnikov emerged as one of the Soviet Union's best known socialist realists. He specialized in two types of paintings: depictions of Soviet leadership (his several drawings of Stalin were favored by the dictator) and of ordinary lives. Children were particularly common in his paintings. Throughout his life, Reshetnikov opposed formalism in art, exposing it wherever he found it. His views were popular with the authorities and he became an appointed member of the Academy of Arts in 1953 and its vice-president in 1974. Reshetnikov received many prestigious governmental awards for his contributions to Soviet culture, including the Stalin Prize. Reshetnikov taught art in two Moscow colleges from 1953 until 1962.

Malte's father, Hanns Ludin, was the Third Reich's ambassador to Slovakia. As such, he signed deportation orders that sent thousands of Jews to Auschwitz. Hanns Ludin was executed for war crimes in 1947. ==Production== Malte Ludin did not undertake this film until after the death of his mother, Erla. The documentary does include clips of earlier interviews he conducted with Erla, however. Malte also interviews his sisters, who recall their father with some fondness. ==Plot== A German filmmaker forces his siblings to come to terms with their father's Nazi past. Despite documentary evidence of Hanns Ludin's direct involvement in the deportation of thousands of Slovak Jews to their deaths, director Malte Ludin's sisters remain in various phases of denial about their dad. His older sister, Barbel, is a particularly staunch denier of any complicity on the part of the elder Ludin, who served as Adolf Hitler's ambassador to Slovakia during World War II. The film exposes the spectrum of reaction to the Holocaust among the post-war generation in Germany. While Ludin confronts his father, and Germany's, guilt full-on, his sister Barbel continually refuses to concede the most basic points about the mass slaughter of millions of Jews by the Nazis. ==Release== 2 oder 3 Dinge, die ich von ihm wei√ü was first shown in 2005.

He received his doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen and practiced medicine in the city of G√∂ttingen. Later he was a physician in Sandstadt near Stade (1857) and Hildesheim (1860). In 1855 Rinne described the combined conductive process of the tympanic membrane and the ossicles of the middle ear. He is known for the eponymous Rinne test. The Rinne test is a hearing test conducted with a tuning fork, and is used to test and compare a patients' hearing via air conduction (normal process) or by way of bone conduction (sound to the inner ear through the mastoid). He reasoned that if a person hears a sound for a longer period of time through bone conduction than through air conduction, a disease is present somewhere in the conduction apparatus. Despite his research, \\"Rinne's test\\" wasn't generally recognized until after his death -- in the early 1880s, otologists Friedrich Bezold (1842-1908) and August Lucae (1835‚Äì1911) further publicized Rinne's work. == Selected writings == *√úber das Stimmorgan und die Bildung der Sprache.

During his career he has performed solos with major orchestras worldwide, won prizes in several international competitions, and recorded extensively. ==Early life and musical training== Kirshbaum was born in Denton, Texas, and grew up in Tyler. His father, Joseph Kirshbaum (1911‚Äì1996), was a professional violinist, composer, conductor, music educator, and an alumnus of Yale (bachelors ‚Äì Davenport College 1968; and masters), where he also had taught. From 1944 to 1947, Joseph Kirshbaum was a faculty member at University of North Texas College of Music, where he also conducted its symphony orchestra. Before joining the North Texas faculty, Joseph Kirshbaum had directed the Messiah Festival Orchestra of Lindsborg, Kansas. And before that, he had organized and directed the Oberlin Conservatory String Orchestra. He also had taught strings at Cornell. Ralph Kirshbaum's mother, Gertrude Morris Kirshbaum (1912-1973) taught harp at Texas Woman's University. Joseph Kirshbaum, for 25 years, was a celebrated conductor of the East Texas Symphony Orchestra. He retired from the ETSO in 1978. Ralph Kirshbaum started cello lessons with his father at age six. At age 11, he continued lessons with Roberta Guastafeste (n√©e Harrison; born 1929), who, back then, was on the music faculty at Southern Methodist University and also was a member of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. At age 14, he began studying cello with Lev Aronson, then of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Kirshbaum won numerous awards as a student and appeared as a soloist with the Dallas Symphony at age 15. Kirshbaum continued his education at the Yale University School of Music, where he studied with Aldo Parisot. He graduated Yale magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with highest departmental honors. In 1968 he earned a Fulbright fellowship, but Selective Service registration issues prevented him from using it. == Career == Kirshbaum attracted international attention when he won prizes in the First International Cassad√≥ Competition in Florence, Italy, in 1969, and subsequently in the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1970. He made his London debut recital at Wigmore Hall in 1970, his professional orchestral debut (performing Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations with the New Philharmonia Orchestra of London) in 1972, and his New York debut at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1976. In his long career Kirshbaum has soloed with most of the world's major orchestras including the BBC Symphony, the Berlin Radio Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony, the Hall√© Orchestra of Manchester, England, the Houston Symphony, the London Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the New Philharmonia Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony, the San Francisco Symphony and many others. As a chamber musician he has collaborated with Yefim Bronfman, Peter Frankl, the Juilliard String Quartet, Garrick Ohlsson, Gy√∂rgy Pauk, Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, the Tokyo String Quartet, Pinchas Zukerman and others. In particular, his longtime trio collaboration with Frankl and Pauk has generated a large number of concerts and recordings. The BBC commissioned Fourteen Little Pictures by James MacMillan to mark their 25th anniversary in 1997. He has participated in numerous major music festivals worldwide. Kirshbaum founded the RNCM Manchester International Cello Festival in 1988 and was its Artistic Director through its grand finale in 2007, which was held at the Royal Northern College of Music, where he had taught. In the fall of 2008, Kirshbaum assumed an appointment at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music as (i) Chair of the Strings Department and (ii) Gregor Piatigorsky Chair in Violoncello, an endowed position. He is the fourth person to hold the Piatigorsky Chair in Violoncello. The three predecessors were Lynn Harrell (1986‚Äì1993) (also from Denton, Texas), Ronald Leonard (1993‚Äì2003) and Eleonore Schoenfeld (2004‚Äì2007). Kirshbaum has recorded extensively; selections from his discography are shown below. His cello was crafted in 1729 by the Venetian maker Domenico Montagnana. ==Personal== Ralph Kirshbaum and his wife, Antoinette, have one son, Alex, who studied music at the Rimon Music School in Israel. ==Selected discography== *Bach: Cello Suites.

The class of satellite knots include composite knots, cable knots and Whitehead doubles. (See Basic families, below for definitions of the last two classes.) A satellite link is one that orbits a companion knot K in the sense that it lies inside a regular neighborhood of the companion. Example 1: A connect-sum of a trefoil and figure-8 knot. A satellite knot K can be picturesquely described as follows: start by taking a nontrivial knot K' lying inside an unknotted solid torus V. Here \\"nontrivial\\" means that the knot K' is not allowed to sit inside of a 3-ball in V and K' is not allowed to be isotopic to the central core curve of the solid torus. Then tie up the solid torus into a nontrivial knot. Example 2: The Whitehead double of the figure-8. This means there is a non-trivial embedding f\\\\colon V \\\\to S^3 and K=f(K'). The central core curve of the solid torus V is sent to a knot H, which is called the \\"companion knot\\" and is thought of as the planet around which the \\"satellite knot\\" K orbits. The construction ensures that f(\\\\partial V) is a non-boundary parallel incompressible torus in the complement of K. Composite knots contain a certain kind of incompressible torus called a swallow-follow torus, which can be visualized as swallowing one summand and following another summand. Example 3: A cable of a connect-sum. Since V is an unknotted solid torus, S^3 \\\\setminus V is a tubular neighbourhood of an unknot J. The 2-component link K' \\\\cup J together with the embedding f is called the pattern associated to the satellite operation. A convention: people usually demand that the embedding f \\\\colon V \\\\to S^3 is untwisted in the sense that f must send the standard longitude of V to the standard longitude of f(V). Said another way, given any two disjoint curves c_1,c_2 \\\\subset V, f preserves their linking numbers i.e.: lk(f(c_1),f(c_2))=lk(c_1,c_2). ==Basic families== When K' \\\\subset \\\\partial V is a torus knot, then K is called a cable knot. Examples 3 and 4 are cable knots. If K' is a non-trivial knot in S^3 and if a compressing disc for V intersects K' in precisely one point, then K is called a connect-sum. Another way to say this is that the pattern K' \\\\cup J is the connect-sum of a non- trivial knot K' with a Hopf link. If the link K' \\\\cup J is the Whitehead link, K is called a Whitehead double. If f is untwisted, K is called an untwisted Whitehead double. ==Examples== Example 1: The connect-sum of a figure-8 knot and trefoil. Example 2: Untwisted Whitehead double of a figure-8. Example 3: Cable of a connect-sum. Example 4: Cable of trefoil. Examples 5 and 6 are variants on the same construction. They both have two non-parallel, non- boundary-parallel incompressible tori in their complements, splitting the complement into the union of three manifolds. In Example 5 those manifolds are: the Borromean rings complement, trefoil complement and figure-8 complement. In Example 6 the figure-8 complement is replaced by another trefoil complement. Example 4: A cable of a trefoil. Example 5: A knot which is a 2-fold satellite i.e.: it has non-parallel swallow-follow tori. Example 6: A knot which is a 2-fold satellite i.e.: it has non-parallel swallow-follow tori. ==Origins== In 1949 Schubert, H. Die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit eines Knotens in Primknoten. S.-B Heidelberger Akad. Wiss. Math.-Nat. Kl. 1949 (1949), 57-104. Horst Schubert proved that every oriented knot in S^3 decomposes as a connect-sum of prime knots in a unique way, up to reordering, making the monoid of oriented isotopy-classes of knots in S^3 a free commutative monoid on countably-infinite many generators. Shortly after, he realized he could give a new proof of his theorem by a close analysis of the incompressible tori present in the complement of a connect-sum. This led him to study general incompressible tori in knot complements in his epic work Knoten und Vollringe,Schubert, H. Knoten und Vollringe. Acta Math. 90 (1953), 131-286. where he defined satellite and companion knots. ==Follow-up work== Schubert's demonstration that incompressible tori play a major role in knot theory was one several early insights leading to the unification of 3-manifold theory and knot theory. It attracted Waldhausen's attention, who later used incompressible surfaces to show that a large class of 3-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if their fundamental groups are isomorphic.Waldhausen, F. On irreducible 3-manifolds which are sufficiently large.Ann. of Math. (2) 87 (1968), 56-88. Waldhausen conjectured what is now the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson-decomposition of 3-manifolds, which is a decomposition of 3-manifolds along spheres and incompressible tori. This later became a major ingredient in the development of geometrization, which can be seen as a partial-classification of 3-dimensional manifolds. The ramifications for knot theory were first described in the long-unpublished manuscript of Bonahon and Siebenmann.F.Bonahon, L.Siebenmann, New Geometric Splittings of Classical Knots, and the Classification and Symmetries of Arborescent Knots, ==Uniqueness of satellite decomposition== In Knoten und Vollringe, Schubert proved that in some cases, there is essentially a unique way to express a knot as a satellite. But there are also many known examples where the decomposition is not unique.Motegi, K. Knot Types of Satellite Knots and Twisted Knots. Lectures at Knots '96. World Scientific. With a suitably enhanced notion of satellite operation called splicing, the JSJ decomposition gives a proper uniqueness theorem for satellite knots.Eisenbud, D. Neumann, W.

The Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (LLLL), commonly known as the \\"Four L\\" (4L), was a company union found in the United States during World War I in 1917 by the War Department as a counter to the Industrial Workers of the World. ==HistoryEstablishment=== In October 1917 Colonel Brice P. Disque was dispatched to the Pacific Northwest to investigate the reasons behind what was deemed an inadequate supply of spruce for the Division of Military Aeronautics of the War Department.Robert L. Tyler, Rebels of the Woods: The IWW in the Pacific Northwest. Eugene, OR: University of Oregon Books, 1967; pg. 101. A career Army officer, Disque had resigned his commission in 1916 to become a prison warden in the state of Michigan before rejoining the Army during the war to work as a \\"trouble shooter\\" on military procurement problems. The summer of 1917 had seen a widespread lumber strike throughout the Pacific Northwest led in part by the radical Industrial Workers of the World. Despite a decision to end the work stoppage in the lumber strike, by September shipments of spruce ‚Äî a strong and flexible wood urgently needed for the production of military aircraft ‚Äî had risen only to 2.6 million board feet per month, a fraction of the 10 million board feet required.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 102. Col. Disque met with industry leaders in Seattle upon his arrival before setting out on a 10-day tour of lumber operations in the region. Noting the ongoing labor difficulties in the region, Disque determined to establish a special military division to be dispatched to lumber camps as needed, thereby undercutting any residual difficulties which might be presented by recalcitrant union workers. Disque made efforts to win support for his decision to militarize the timber industry by gathering together a select circle of industry leaders at a meeting held at the Benson Hotel in Portland, Oregon towards the end of the month. Col. Brice Disque, later a Brigadier General, is credited with having devised the plan for the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen. On November 2, Disque returned to Washington, DC to win approval for his plan from Wilson administration officials, including Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Disque's plan was rapidly approved and 100 officers were committed to the effort to put the Pacific Northwest lumber industry under military control.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 103. A major meeting was held in Centralia, Washington in November bringing together representatives of 16 of the region's largest lumber companies, who were persuaded to sponsor units of a new labor-centered organization that was part and parcel of the attempt to end labor strife through militarization.Tom Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919: Elmer Smith and the Wobblies. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1993; pg. 31. This new organization was to be known as the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (LLLL) ‚Äî commonly known as the \\"Four Ls.\\" The first local of this new organization was founded in Wheeler, Oregon on November 30, 1917. Lieutenant Maurice E. Crumpacker of the US Army Signal Corps was sent on the road to various lumber camps and mills of Washington and Oregon to administer a loyalty oath to the workers there, the sole act required for membership in the LLLL. These signed pledges read in part: > I, the undersigned, ...do hereby solemnly pledge my efforts during the war > to the United States of America and will support and defend this country > against enemies foreign and domestic. > I further swear...to faithfully perform my duty toward this company by > directing my best efforts, in every way possible, to the production of logs > and lumber for the construction of Army airplanes and ships to be used > against our common enemies. That I will stamp out any sedition or acts of > hostility against the United States Government which may come within my > knowledge, and I will do every act and thing which will in general aid in > carrying this war to a successful conclusion.Quoted in Cloice R. Howd, > Industrial Relations in the West Coast Lumber Industry. Bulletin No. 349. > Washington, DC: Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, 1924; > pg. 78. Failure to take this loyalty oath could be met with discharge from employment and even arrest.\\"Loggers Arrested on Marble Creek: Aliens Refuse to Take Oath of Loyal Legion and Are Apprehended,\\" Spokane Spokesman-Review, vol. 35, no. 352 (May 1, 1918), pg. 10. Next to the loyalty-pledged civilian workers, a total of 25,000 soldiers were committed to work in the logging camps and mills of the Pacific Northwest over the next year in the so-called Spruce Production Division.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 104. Soldiers in the camps and mills received civilian pay for their efforts, with the Army paying the minimal base salary given to all soldiers with the logging or mill contractors making up the difference.Harold M. Hyman, Soldiers and Spruce: Origins of the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen. Los Angeles: Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California, 1963; pg. 118. Troops lived under military discipline throughout. Headquarters for the division was based at the Vancouver Barracks, just across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon. Historian Tom Copeland notes: ===Development=== The LLLL and the Spruce Production Division issued a monthly magazine during 1918 called the Monthly Bulletin. Despite the rather vague form of the LLLL, an effort was made to give the organization some of the basic forms of an industrial union. After gaining the signed pledges of workers, the military \\"officer-organizers\\" would see that civilian members were gathered into \\"locals\\" ‚Äî groups which elected grievance committees which were nominally responsible for the mediation of problems in the woods or the mill with owners and bosses. In the view of at least one historian this function seems to have been only of minimal effectiveness in practice, however, since \\"in the early months, the only real function of the local was to meet production quotas, perhaps manage a suggestion box, and be a display counter of pledged patriots.\\" Indeed, at the time of its inception Disque did not envision the LLLL as a union of any kind, but rather a loose patriotic society. In was not until late in the summer of 1918, in the waning months of the European war, that a conference of LLLL district representatives was convened in Portland to establish a formal constitution for the organization ‚Äî a document drafted in advance by Disque and his assistants. According to the 1918 constitution, each local was to elect delegates to district boards, which would each choose employer and employee delegates to the \\"Headquarters Council,\\" over which Disque maintained executive control. The constitution further stipulated that each local was to elect a \\"conference committee\\" in charge of carrying grievances to the employer and negotiating their amelioration.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 105. Owing to its lack of dues and near mandatory status, the LLLL grew rapidly. Within six months of its establishment some 80,000 workers had taken the organization's pledge, rising to nearly 100,000 civilian workers in 1918.Nancy Gentile Ford, The Great War and America: Civil-Military Relations during World War I. Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2008; pg. 69. The syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World found itself isolated and submerged by the massive new de facto company union, with repression of some of its leading activists adding to the IWW's difficult organizational situation. The rival American Federation of Labor ‚Äî a lesser force in this industry at this time ‚Äî found its position no better despite union head Samuel Gompers's initial endorsement of the Loyal Legion.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 109. Organizers for the AF of L complained that the officer-organizers of the LLLL banned them from speaking, broke up union organizing meetings, and ejected them from the camps. In fact, most adherents of the IWW and the American Federation of Labor's Timber Workers Union seem to have ultimately joined the Loyal Legion, despite its status as a de facto \\"company union.\\" An additional reason for the Loyal Legion's hegemony during the war related to its leading role on the issue of the 8-hour day ‚Äî a major goal of American workers for decades. In February 1918 Col. Disque established a committee of 25 prominent lumbermen in Portland and charged them with devising an agreement to establishing the 8-hour day in the lumber industry.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 106. Pressure from Disque and the Wilson administration in Washington ‚Äî the chief consumer of finished goods ‚Äî was instrumental in ensuring a positive outcome, and the marathon session of lumbermen eventually yielded fruit. On the morning of March 1, 1918, Disque announced the adoption of the 8-hour day to the press. At the end of the war the Loyal Legion was represented by over 1000 locals organized into 12 districts. From the US government's perspective the organization was a massive success, with production of spruce boosted to more than 20 million board-feet per month. ===After World War I=== A tree felled for production by US troops. The LLLL, seen as a model institution of class collaboration, survived after the termination of World War I in November 1918 ‚Äî having largely ameliorated the bitter strife between workers and capitalists that had swept the industry over previous years. The organization was seen as something of value by both sides of the production process. Two conventions were held in December 1918, one in Portland, participated in by the 8 districts of Western Oregon and Washington, and another in Spokane, including the four districts spread across the so- called Inland Empire of Central and Eastern Washington state.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 112. These conventions elected a new civilian board of executives and began the work of preparing a permanent constitution. The new constitution provided for annual conventions for each of the 12 districts, to which each local was to elect one worker delegate and one employer delegate. The president of the organization or any member of the board of directors was to preside over each of these gatherings. The board of directors was to serve as the decision-making authority in the case of disagreements which could not be resolved. The LLLL provided a variety of membership services. No fewer than 5 of the 12 district offices maintained free employment agencies for workers seeking employment.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 113. In many other towns around the region, the Loyal Legion maintained social halls, providing recreational opportunities for workers. The reforms of the war period were defended as best they were able by the board of directors through traveling inspectors, although these did not retain the same sort of authority wielded by the officer-organizers of the military during wartime. From 1926, the board of directors negotiated a group insurance plan for sickness or on-the-job accidents covering LLLL members.Four L Lumber News, July 1926, pg. 13, cited in Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 113. ===Termination and legacy=== Over time participation in the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen declined, replaced by other more aggressive labor organizations. The LLLL was finally terminated in 1938.The Origins of the Loyal Legion of Loggers & Lumbermen: The Origins of the World‚Äôs Largest Company Union and How it Conducted Business, Seattle General Strike Project, directed by James Gregory and sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies at the University of Washington, 1999. The group is remembered by historians for the role it played in helping to end the major influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest. It was, as historian Robert L. Tyler has recalled, the \\"carrot\\" of ameliorative reform that accompanied the \\"stick\\" of violence and deportation used against the IWW in the Western timber industry: > The Loyal Legion...undercut the IWW quite effectively. In the summer of > 1917, the IWW appeared to control an entire industry, but by the end of the > war, the IWW was not only suppressed, it had been dispersed and absorbed.... > In the minds of all but the most dedicated Wobblies the ferocious ideas of > the class struggle evaporated in the atmosphere of patriotism, the eight- > hour day, and palpable improvements of living conditions. The Wobblies of > hard revolutionary substance had to be driven with the club rather than led > by the carrot.Tyler, Rebels of the Woods, pg. 115. In the view of historian Harold M. Hyman, the 4L was a largely spontaneous entity, not the product of \\"deliberate academic estimations conducted in a sober committee room,\\" but rather a \\"reflexive, unplanned, and opportunistic creation.\\"Hyman, Soldiers and Spruce, pg. 13. Hyman depicts the Loyal Legion as a manifestation of \\"a kind of Progressivism in khaki\\" ‚Äî an example of the Wilson administration's willingness to use government intervention to rationalize the competitive struggle that was part and parcel of capitalism.Hyman, Soldiers and Spruce, pp. 15-16. ==Official organ== Beginning in March 1918 the Spruce Production Division of the Army and the Loyal Legion published a magazine in Portland, Oregon called the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen Monthly Bulletin. ==See also== * Spruce Production Division ==Further reading== * Cloice R.

He held senior posts at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, London, and the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital. He was the author of some 150 scientific papers and the co-author of several books on psychiatric topics, notably on disputed 'physical methods'. From the mid-50s to his death, he co-edited Clinical Psychiatry, the leading textbook for psychiatric trainees. == Early life and medical education == Eliot Slater was born in Plumstead, London, on 28 August 1904. His father was Gilbert Slater, an economic historian who became Professor of Indian Economics at the University of Madras and later principal of Ruskin College, Oxford. His mother, Violet Oakeshott, a Quaker and pacifist, was instrumental in sending him to Leighton Park School, Reading, from where he won an exhibition to St John's College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, in which he gained a third class degree. He went on to St George's Hospital, London, and qualified as a doctor in 1928. In 1931 he was appointed medical officer at the Maudsley Hospital, London, where he was encouraged by his chiefs Aubrey Lewis and Edward Mapother to apply statistical methods to the empirical study of mental illness.'Slater, Eliot Trevor Oakeshott (1904‚Äì1983)', by psychiatrist Hugh Series, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 24 Feb 2015] == Germany 1934-5 and 1937/39; the Second World War == In 1934 Slater was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation travelling fellowship, which he used to study psychiatric genetics under Bruno Schulz at the Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Psychiatrie (Psychiatric Research Institute) in Munich (which he would visit again in 1937). He also made visits to other psychiatric institutes in Germany and in Denmark, Sweden and Austria. By this time Nazi persecution of Jewish professionals was well under way, and on Mapother's initiative the Rockefeller Foundation started providing funds enabling the Maudsley to receive prominent psychiatrists expelled from their posts in Germany. Among them was Willi Mayer-Gross, with whom Slater subsequently collaborated both in research and in the writing of a celebrated textbook. Slater would later describe Schulz as a man of utmost scientific integrity and an uncompromising opponent of the Nazi regime; in fact Schulz supported its early racial hygiene measures and forced sterilization, publishing in 1934 in a journal edited by senior Nazis such as Heinrich Himmler. The director of the Munich Institute and head of its genetics department was Ernst Rudin, the predominant architect and rationaliser of Hitler's eugenic sterilization policies and implicated in Action T4.The Gene Illusion: Genetic Research in Psychiatry and Psychology Under the Microscope Meanwhile, at the Munich institute, Slater met his future wife Lydia Pasternak, a chemist and daughter of the Russian artist Leonid Pasternak and sister of the poet Boris Pasternak. He returned to his post at the Maudsley Hospital, accompanied by Lydia Pasternak. As he wrote, \\"It was a source of peculiar satisfaction to me to be showing what I thought of Nazi Rassenhygiene by marrying a Jewess, a member of an inferior race by their standards, a lady of the highest genetical aristocracy by mine.\\" Her elderly parents followed from Berlin, and soon her cousin brought his family (being her sister and their two children) to England.Autobiographical Sketch by Eliot Slater, in Man, Mind and Heredity (ed. J. Shields and I. I. Gottesman), 1971, The Johns Hopkins Press. Slater would later refer to the Nazis as 'unspeakable men' and 'devils' with a 'detestable ideology', and noted the Nazification of the Munich institute when he left in 1935, claiming to have never seen much of Rudin and to only recall once interacting socially with him at a ceremonial dinner at his home. However, in a lecture delivered in 1936, two thirds of Slater's references were to members of the Munich institute. In an article published in 1936 he surveyed the German forced sterilization practices but did not disagree in principle; in fact he suggested they would undoubtedly succeed to some degree but questioned the technical implementation and whether force was the most efficient strategy. While the article caused some professional irritation to Rudin, it did not stop Slater gaining Rudin's support for publishing two lengthy articles in German journals, nor contributing to an academic celebration in Munich in 1939 for Rudin's 65th birthday, publishing an article in German in the festschrift in his honour.Baltic Eugenics: Bio-Politics, Race and Nation in Interwar Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 1918-1940 : 3. Eliot Slater and the Institutionalization of Psychiatric Genetics in the United Kingdom pg312 With the outbreak of war in 1939 the Maudsley was evacuated, and Slater became clinical director of the Sutton Emergency Hospital, where he had responsibility for the treatment of some 20,000 psychiatric casualties. This experience led to the influential book An Introduction to Physical Methods of Treatment in Psychiatry (with William Sargant, 1944). == Post-war years == Eliot Slater's first marriage was dissolved in 1946 and he married Jean Fyfe Foster in the same year. In an article published in a eugenics journal in 1947, Slater tentatively suggested that group differences between Jews and Christians might disappear (along, therefore, with anti-semitism) due to inter-breeding. Also in 1946, he was appointed Physician in psychological medicine at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, London, where he worked for eighteen years. He resigned in 1964 in protest at the hospital's rejection of the offer of a benefaction from the Mental Health Research Fund to establish a chair in psychiatry, writing in his resignation letter that the collective views of his colleagues had \\"‚Ä¶turned increasingly counter to everything for which I have stood\\", and that they had failed to appreciate the need for academic research in psychiatry. In 1949 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1949‚Äì1953). He was strongly opposed to capital punishment, not only as a barbarity, but also because statistical studies indicated that it was ineffective. He was delighted when capital punishment was finally abolished in 1969. Meanwhile, he continued his own research as senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, notably on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in twins (with James Shields). In 1959 he helped establish the Medical Research Council Psychiatric Genetics Unit at the Maudsley Medical School/Institute of Psychiatry, which he directed until 1969. His work here culminated in The Genetics of Mental Disorders (with Valerie Cowie, 1971). Slater was known for advocating from 1958 a 'monogenic' theory of schizophrenia, by which it was alleged to be caused by a single (partially dominant) gene.A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry. By Edward Shorter. pg 283 Among his numerous other publications, one to be singled out is Clinical Psychiatry (with Willi Mayer-Gross and Martin Roth, 1954), which became a standard textbook for doctors and students, and remained so for many years (third edition 1969 by Slater and Roth; revised 1977). He gave the Litchfield (1959), Galton (1960) and Mapother (1960) lectures. In his Maudsley (1961) lecture and later writings he questioned the concept of 'hysteria' as a valid diagnosis, showing that serious physical illness subsequently emerged in many patients initially labelled 'hysterical' and arguing that the physical illness could often account for their allegedly psychological symptoms; in this respect he disputed the Washington University in St Louis school, primarily Samuel Guze. He was editor of the British Journal of Psychiatry from 1961 to 1972, and transformed it into a leading European journal. In 1966 he was appointed CBE. He held honorary fellowships of several British, German and American medical and psychiatric societies. He was vice chair of the Eugenics Society from 1963 to 1966, having been a Fellow from 1957 to 1977. He received an honorary degree from the University of Dundee in 1971. Slater, along with his close associate William Sargant, was an \\"evangelical\\" proponent of the crude brain surgery known as the lobotomy, even into the 1970s.Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People Since 1845Women and Psychiatric Modernism They long advocated for a range of other 'physical' treatments, including insulin coma therapy, even well after clinical trials cast doubt on its efficacy. It has been noted that originally (1944) they wrote that their judgements of efficacy ‚Äì in the absence of any known theoretical basis for it ‚Äì were on purely empirical (research) grounds, but later (e.g. 1963) they justified them as the insights of the careful and attentive observer.The Social Organization of Mental Illness By Lindsay Prior. Pg 73 They repeatedly emphasised benefits over psychotherapy in terms of speed and 'convenience' in dealing with large numbers of mental patients, and in 'certainty' of improvements; however the claims of curative or transformative powers proved hollow, and they were sometimes used to make patients easier to manage.The psychiatric social worker as social therapist, 1945-1970. Long, V. (2011). Medical History, 55(2), 223-239. Slater died at his home in Barnes, London, on 15 May 1983, being survived by his first and second wives and by the four children of his first marriage ‚Äì a mathematician, a haematologist, a psychiatrist and an English don. King's College London, under whose umbrella the Institute of Psychiatry now operates, has continued to memorialise his psychiatric work by holding an annual 'Eliot Slater prize in psychiatry' since 1983.Understanding Mental Health: A Critical Realist Exploration David Pilgrim. Pg 51- == Outside interests == He had wide interests outside his work. They included chess (he published a statistical investigation of chess openings), music (studying and publishing on the pathography of Schumann and other composers), poetry (he published a book of his own, often rather dark, poems, The Ebbless Sea), euthanasia (he joined the Euthanasia Society after his retirement), painting (an exhibition of his paintings was held in 1977), and the statistical study of literature (he was awarded a PhD from London University at the age of 77 for a statistical word study of the play Edward III, which provided evidence that the play was by Shakespeare). In an essay of 1969 (now in ETOS; see below), he also applied his professional expertise to the authorship question with particular reference to the Sonnets. He found the psychological difficulties raised by the orthodox view of William Shakespeare of Stratford- upon-Avon's authorship \\"most insuperable\\" but resolutely stuck to a principle of open-mindedness without pitching for any other candidate. ==References== == Bibliography (books only) == Introduction to physical methods of treatment in psychiatry (with W.

This area is known to affect the cerebellum with its axonal projections. These afferent connections have been proven to project not only ipsilaterally, but also to decussate and project to the contralateral side of the vermis. It has also been shown that the projections from the pontine tegmentum to the cerebellar lobes are only crossed fibers. The reticulotegmental nucleus also receives efferent axons from the cerebellum. This nucleus is known for its large number of multipolar cells and its particularly reticular structure. The reticulotegmental nucleus is topographically related to pontine nuclei (non-reticular), being just dorsal to them. The reticulotegmental nucleus has been known to mediate eye movements, otherwise known as saccadic movement. This makes sense concerning their connections, as it would require a nucleus that receives and projects to the cerebellum to mediate that kind of complex circuitry. Furthermore, in terms of behavior, one does not think about saccadic movements when scanning a room, as the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex. The pontine nuclei are the most traditionally studied mostly because it is easy to see which nuclei degrade when the cerebellum is amputated. The neurons of the lateral reticular formation are very important for reflexes and the mediation of posture. It has been shown in cats that electrical stimulation of the reticular formation can make a standing cat lie down. Also, stimulation of the cat in an alternative spot can make a lying cat stand. ==References== Category:Pons ","title":"Reticulotegmental nucleus"},{"id":"9101108","text":"The lateral reticular nucleus, of the lateral funiculus, can be divided into three subnuclei, the parvocellular, magnocellular and the subtrigeminal. As is typical of the reticular formation, none of these are very distinct subnuclei, but rather blurred distinctions between cell types and location. The lateral reticular nucleus sends all of its projections to the cerebellum. * The parvocellular portion of the LRN and the immediately adjacent magnocellular portion send most their projections to the vermis of the cerebellum. The rest of the magnocellular subnucleus sends its projections to the hemisphere regions of the cerebellum. * The subtrigeminal nucleus sends its projections to the flocculonodular lobe. All of these efferent pathways are projected in an ipsilateral manner to the cerebellum, the most abundant of which are those to the vermis. This nucleus is also involved in the mediation of inspiration (in-breathing) with a part of the ventral r. nucleus. The afferent pathways to the LRN come from the spinal cord and higher brain structures. Most of the afferents come from the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord and project exclusively to the parts of the LRN that do not receive input from the cortex. The spinal cord projections terminate mostly in the parvocellular region along with the adjacent magnocellular cells. This implies that most input from the spinal cord is relayed into the vermis.Jouvet, M. Handbook of clinical neurology vol 3. P. J. Vinken and G. W. Bruyen, eds. North Holland Publishing company.

Like blinkers, it partially restricts the horse's vision, and helps them to concentrate on what is in front of them, rather than objects on the ground (such as shadows). Shadow rolls are most commonly used in horse racing, both on the flat and harness racing, as some horses will try to jump shadows on the ground, behavior that will slow them down. They are also occasionally, albeit rarely, seen in eventing. The shadow roll is also seen in show jumping competitions, especially for horses who have a tendency to raise their heads too high and evade the bit. The shadow roll is intended to correct this by forcing the horse to lower his head in order to see the jump; when the horse's head is raised the roll blocks his vision.

She is the former Executive Director of Communications for Canada's National Arts Centre, located in Ottawa. She is the former deputy bureau chief of the parliamentary bureau for CTV News. She was a reporter and frequent guest host on CTV programs including Question Period and Mike Duffy Live. She is a veteran political correspondent who has covered election campaigns in the United States, Quebec and Ottawa. ==Life and career== Thompson began her career as a summer intern at the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS in New York City in the 1980s. After graduating from Carleton University's School of Journalism in 1987 she was hired by the CBC in Winnipeg as an editorial assistant. She quickly climbed the reporting ranks at CBWT's 24 Hours program in the late 1980s. Thompson met her husband, Pierre Boulet, in Winnipeg. He worked as a reporter for Radio-Canada, the French language services of the CBC. They married on 16 June 1990, just a week after the Meech Lake Accord was signed in Ottawa. But when that political accord began to unravel, Thompson wanted to move back to her home province of Quebec, to cover the political situation. Thompson was hired by CBC Montreal's news program NewsWatch in 1991. Her mentors included the legendary assignment editor there, Bernard St-Laurent, and anchor Dennis Trudeau. In 1995, just six months before a potential referendum, Thompson left the CBC for CTV, because she wanted a seat on the referendum campaign bus. Her life had been marked by Quebec politics and she wanted a front row seat to history. CTV News gave her that chance, when she was named \\"Montreal Bureau Chief\\" in March 1995. Thompson's favourite political campaign was the 1995 referendum. Her favourite story was an investigation into how the Ontario Government handled the Dionne quintuplet's trust fund. Thompson's documentary resulted in a $4 million settlement paid to the surviving Dionne sisters by the Ontario Government. In 2000, Thompson was named the first ever woman correspondent for CTV News in Washington. She covered the end of the Clinton Presidency, the cliff-hanger election of George W. Bush against Al Gore. She was in Washington on the morning of September 11, 2001 when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. She covered the initial attack and its aftermath, and was on the south lawn of the White House when secret service agents warned her to leave the area because another plane was heading to Washington. That plane eventually crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Thompson comes from a family of successful broadcasters, her sister, Virginia Thompson is the executive producer of Corner Gas a top-rated sitcom on CTV. Her cousin, Shelagh Rogers is the Host of Sounds Like Canada on CBC Radio. Her brother owns several restaurants in Vancouver. Thompson is a member of the Board of Research Canada, volunteers for the Ottawa Chapter of The Famous Five Foundation and is a member of Equal Voice. She has served as a Director of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, and served for three years on the Board of the Children's Bridge Foundation. In 2002, Thompson and her family moved to Ottawa for her to take up the post with CTV News. Her husband is a teacher at a private school in Ottawa. She is a mother of three children, two boys and a girl adopted from China. Her son Maxime died accidentally in Qualicum Beach in 2002. Since joining the National Arts Centre in 2009 she has worked as the lead organizer of the Royal Visit to the NAC in June 2010, when the Queen unveiled a statue of jazz great, Oscar Peterson, in front of a live audience of 10,000 people. She has re-introduced the tradition of screening great Canadian films at the NAC, including Genius Within: The Inner Life of Glenn Gould, Barney's Version, Starbuck and Breakaway. She brought the Genie Awards for the first time to the NAC in March, 2011 which was broadcast nationally on the CBC. She also produced a 9/11 requiem concert with the National Arts Centre Orchestra that was covered by all major media outlets in Canada. == References == ==External links== * CTV Biography * Category:1964 births Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:Carleton University alumni Category:Living people Category:Journalists from Quebec Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Canadian women television journalists Category:People from Montreal ","title":"Rosemary Thompson"},{"id":"9101203","text":"The Free Breakfast Table was the demand of British working-class Liberalism from the 1860s to the early twentieth-century.

Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel passed through southwestern Pennsylvania, though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout much of the state. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $160 million in damage (2003 USD, $187 million 2008 USD) and two indirect deaths in Pennsylvania. One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages. Moderate winds left about 1.4 million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees. == Preparations == While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a major hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would pass through the central portion of the state. Successive forecasts shifted the track slightly further to the west, though its track into Ohio was not anticipated. Hours before it entered the state, the National Hurricane Center continued to predict Isabel would traverse the entire length of the state from south to north and later entering New York before crossing Lake Ontario into Canada. Around 3% of those who evacuated in North Carolina and in the Eastern Shore of Virginia stayed in Pennsylvania during the storm. The threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out of the state. To compensate, Delta Air Lines allowed those flying to or from Philadelphia, Allentown, and Harrisburg to reschedule to a later date. American Airlines offered a similar option. United Airlines and United Express opted to waive charging fees for travelers in and out of the state. Prior to the arrival of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell declared a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990 guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500 workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison. == Impact == Upon making landfall, Isabel produced a storm surge that tracked up the Delaware River, with a station along the river in Philadelphia reporting a storm tide of 9.47 feet (2.89 m). There, the surge flooded low-lying areas along the river. The large circulation of the hurricane produced moderate winds throughout the state, with wind gusts in the southeastern portion of the state reaching 60 mph (95 km/h) in Forks Township. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania also recorded a wind gust of 49 mph (79 km/h), which contributed to severe delays at the Philadelphia International Airport. The moderate wind gust downed thousands of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. PECO energy reported their worst power outage on record with about 572,425 customers losing electricity. The company estimated it would cost at least $20 million (2003 USD, $23 million 2008 USD) for it to install about 81 miles (130 km) of new cable and install about 7,600 new fuses and circuit breakers. The Metropolitan Edison power company reported 300,000 customers without power, with 500,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers losing electricity. Rainfall totals from Hurricane Isabel Wind gusts reached 60 mph (95 km/h) in northeastern Pennsylvania, resulting in scattered reports of downed trees and power lines. Tens of thousands were left without power. A few downed trees hit cars and houses, with damage totaling about $350,000 (2003 USD, $410,000 in 2008 USD). The fallen trees also closed some roads. In the central portion of the state, the storm dropped moderate precipitation of over 3 inches (75 mm), while wind gusts reached 73 mph (117 km/h) at a station in Lancaster County. The combination of the wind gusts and moist grounds from previous rainfalls resulted in hundreds of downed tree limbs, primarily in Dauphin and Lancaster Counties. Lancaster County reportedly suffered the worst wind damage since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The falling trees downed power lines and poles, causing power outages and some property damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56 roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County. Pittsburgh reported 1.24 inches (31 mm) of precipitation from Isabel. The storm produced wind gusts of up to 60 mph (95 km/h) across the southwestern portion of the state, knocking down trees and power lines. Allegheny Energy reported 31,184 customers in the southwest portion of the state lost power, primarily in McConnellsburg, State College, and Waynesboro. Damage in southeastern Pennsylvania totaled $32.2 million (2003 USD; $37.7 million 2008 USD). == Aftermath == Power workers immediately began repairing the power failures by clearing tree branches and replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Peco energy restored power to 72% of the affected customers by two days after the storm, with 85% restored by two nights. By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light restored power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most power outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all power completely restored by a week after Isabel. On September 26, President Bush declared Chester County as a disaster area following the damage of previous Henri, Isabel, and severe flooding unrelated to either tropical cyclone. Officials opened a disaster recovery center in West Chester to provide additional information to disaster victims. By a month after the declaration, 342 homeowners and business owners applied for disaster aid, totaling to around $600,000 (2003 USD, $703,000 2008 USD). == See also == * List of Pennsylvania hurricanes * List of retired Atlantic hurricane names == References == Pennsylvania Isabel (2003) Category:2003 in Pennsylvania Isabel ","title":"Effects of Hurricane Isabel in Pennsylvania"},{"id":"9101286","text":"The Court of Disputed Returns in New South Wales is a court within the Australian court hierarchy established initially in 1928 pursuant to the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Amendment Act,. and since 2017 pursuant to the Electoral Act 2017.. The jurisdiction of the Court is exercised by the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court considers petitions concerning the validity of any election or return under the Act. The Court is concerned with elections held for the New South Wales Parliament and local government elections within the state. The Court may also consider questions respecting the qualifications of a member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council, or respecting a vacancy in either, but only if that question was referred by either the Assembly or the Council. The Court may declare that any person was not qualified to be a member of parliament, declare that any person was not capable of sitting as a member of parliament, or to declare that there is a vacancy. ==The petition== The petition may be filed by the candidate or an elector entitled to vote at that election. In considering the petition, the court may inquire whether or not the petition is duly signed, and so far as rolls and voting are concerned may inquire into the identity of persons, and whether their votes were improperly admitted or rejected, assuming the roll to be correct, but the court shall not inquire into the correctness of any roll. For elections of officers to Aboriginal Land Councils under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), or a Rural Lands Board under the Rural Lands Protection Act 1998 (NSW), the Land and Environment Court acts to consider disputed returns. ==History== The Court's jurisdiction over disputed electoral returns can be traced to the practices of the United Kingdom Parliament. Until 1604, disputed returns were decided by the King in Chancery. From 1604 to 1868, the British House of Commons exercised the jurisdiction. The Grenville Act 1770 (UK) provided for the determination of disputes by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. Later, a committee of 11 members were chosen by ballot to report their decision to the House. In essence, the parliament had the jurisdiction to determine whether a person had been properly elected, rather than the Courts. In 1868, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK) was passed conferring jurisdiction on two judges of the Queen's Bench. The transfer of jurisdiction from Parliament to the courts was hastened by a concern with the partisanship of Parliament in ruling on electoral disputes. At the time of Federation of Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania had transferred jurisdiction over disputed returns to their Supreme Courts. South Australia and Queensland had created hybrid tribunals. Victoria and New South Wales retained the exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputed returns for themselves. New South Wales gave the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction over disputed returns with the introduction of section 32 of the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections (Amendment) Act 1928. The High Court of Australia sits as the Australian Court of Disputed Returns for federal elections. Prior to the enactment of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act (No 1) 2001, which commenced on 16 July 2001, the High Court could refer federal electoral disputes to the Supreme Court of a state.

Share has the distinction of being the first NBA draft pick ever: Share was the No. 1 draft pick in the first organized National Basketball Association draft on April 25, 1950. Share was selected by the Boston Celtics as the No. 1 overall pick in the inaugural 1950 NBA draft. ==Early life== Share attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He had an injured ankle and did not begin playing basketball until his junior year at Western Hills. ==College career== Share attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, after being recruited by Coach Harold Anderson. He was named a 1950 All-American his senor year. Share graduated as the Bowling Green College Falcons' all-time scoring leader with 1,730 points. With Share, Bowling Green won 28 games in 1946-47, 27 games in 1947-48, 24 games in 1948-49 and 19 games in 1949-50. Share has his career-high 39 points against Loyola (Calif.) on Dec. 22, 1949 in Madison Square Garden. ==NBA careerCeltics/Waterloo Hawks=== Share was drafted by the Celtics, whose fans wanted the team to draft local Holy Cross star, Bob Cousy with the pick. The Celtics' new Coach Red Auerbach defended the unpopular pick of Share, saying \\"We need a big man. Little men are a dime a dozen. I'm supposed to win, not go after local yokels. In an irony, future Hall of Famer Cousy ended up being drafted third by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. Cousy then balked at playing in Moline, Illinois, eventually forcing his rights to be sold to the Chicago Stags. The Stags then folded before the season and the Celtics chose Cousy in the dispersal draft. For his part, Share did not sign with the Celtics. Instead he signed with the Waterloo Hawks in the fledgling National Professional Basketball League (1950‚Äì51), playing for Coach Jack Smiley. Share averaged 11.0 points for the Hawks, playing in 19 games. The NPBL, composed of some former NBA teams in small markets and new teams in major markets, folded after the season. Then on April 26, 1951, Share's rights were traded by the Celtics to the Fort Wayne Pistons for future Hall of Famer Bill Sharman, who had refused to sign with the Pistons. In two-and-a-half seasons with Fort Wayne, Share averaged 4.2 points and 5.1 rebounds in limited playing time. ===St. Louis: 3 NBA Finals, Championship=== On December 21, 1953, Share was traded by the Fort Wayne Pistons to the Milwaukee Hawks for Max Zaslofsky. In seven seasons with the Milwaukee/St Louis Hawks, Share averaged a near double- double of 9.2 points and 9.9 rebounds. His role as a rebounding force in the middle, setting screens and playing strong defense freed Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame teammates Bob Pettit, Ed Macauley, Cliff Hagan and Slater Martin to better play their games. Share was named as the team captain and the Hawks made the NBA Finals against the Celtics for three consecutive years. Share was the captain of the 1958 NBA champion St. Louis Hawks team. In the 1958 NBA Finals victory against the Celtics, Share averaged 6.2 points and 6.0 rebounds in the six game series, in a key reserve role. On February 1, 1960, the Hawks traded Share, Nick Mantis and Willie Merriweather to the Minneapolis Lakers for Larry Foust. Initially, Share refused to go to the Lakers, but he reconsidered and went to Minneapolis in time for the playoffs. The Lakers were eventually defeated by the Hawks in the Western Division Finals. Share then retired at the end of the 1959-1960 season. Overall, Share played nine years in the NBA for the Fort Wayne Pistons, Milwaukee Hawks/St. Louis Hawks and the Minneapolis Lakers. He played 596 games, with 4,928 points and 4,986 rebounds. His career averages were 8.3 points and 8.4 rebounds. Share led the NBA in disqualifications during the 1954‚Äì55 season. ==Personal life== After retiring from basketball, Share never left the St. Louis area and pursued business ventures. Share started Sharick Packaging, Inc.and then sold Sharick in 1985. He then formed Sylvan-Edge Farm with his wife, Rose. Share died on June 7, 2012 in Chesterfield, Missouri, at age 85. He had lived in Creve Coeur, Missouri and was survived by his wife Rose and daughters Ann and Cindy. ==Honors== * Share was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. * Share was inducted into the Bowling Green State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1964. ==References== ==External links== *Career statistics Category:1927 births Category:2012 deaths Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Ohio Category:Boston Celtics draft picks Category:Bowling Green Falcons men's basketball players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Fort Wayne Pistons players Category:Milwaukee Hawks players Category:Minneapolis Lakers players Category:Sportspeople from Akron, Ohio Category:St. Louis Hawks players Category:Waterloo Hawks players ","title":"Chuck Share"},{"id":"9101312","text":"The paramedian reticular nucleus (in Terminologia Anatomica, or paramedian medullary reticular group in NeuroNames) sends its connections to the spinal cord in a mostly ipsilateral manner, although there is some decussation.

Bellamy was born in Wigan, Lancashire and took up employment as an engine-driver for the London and North Western Railway. He became involved in trade union activities, rising to the presidency of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. During the 1911 transport strike, he was prominent in leading the successful campaign for union recognition by the railway companies. When the ASRS was merged with two other rail unions in 1913 to form the National Union of Railwaymen, Bellamy was its first president, serving until 1917.Mr. Bellamy M.P., Work For Railwaymen And Pensions, The Times, 27 March 1931, p. 16 From 1917 to 1927 he was a member of the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal.

He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party at Wakefield at the 1918 and 1922 general elections. He eventually entered the Commons when he was elected member of parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in October 1928, after the sitting Conservative MP Cornelius Homan was disqualified when he was declared bankrupt. Bellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election. Following the election, the Second Labour Government was formed, and he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to F O Roberts, Minister of Pensions.

Richard Jones and James Young, and written by J.G. Hawks. The movie was produced by the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. ==Plot== Mickey (Normand) is an adult orphan who has been raised since girlhood in poverty near Feather River, California by an unsuccessful miner, Joe Meadows, and his housekeeper, Minnie. Mickey is the free-spirited, uncultured daughter of the miner's deceased partner. Meadows took charge of Mickey at his dying partner's request. Mickey is sent to live in Great Neck, Long Island‚Äîpart of suburban New York City‚Äîwith her aunt (Mrs. Geoffrey Drake) and her family. Mrs. Drake is under the impression that Mickey is wealthy and well refined. When Mickey arrives at her aunt's luxurious home, the aunt is disappointed that she is not well-to-do and puts her to work as a servant. Mickey's presence there sparks an awkward love triangle involving her, her cousin (Elsie Drake), and young mining executive Herbert Thornhill (Wheeler Oakman) whom Mickey first encountered in California. Just after Mickey is sent packing, a telegram arrives for her announcing that a vein has been struck on Joe's Tomboy mine and she is suddenly worth millions. Mrs. Drake's opinion of Mickey changes quickly and she is welcomed back‚Äîin the hope she and Mrs Drake's feckless son, Reggie, will become a couple. Herbert had recently proposed to Elsie, but realizes he truly loves Mickey. Shortly afterward, Herbert receives a telegram from his lawyer, Tom Rawlings, explaining that his mining claims are now invalid and thus worthless. Elsie and Mrs. Drake find the telegram and call off the wedding because Herbert is now bankrupt. Herbert tries to regain his fortune by borrowing $5,000 and betting it on a horse race. The race is rigged‚Äîand Mickey finds out about the plot. Just as the race is about to begin, Mickey dresses in jockey silks, unhorses the crooked jockey, and tries to win the race by riding it for Herbert. Just as it appears Mickey's horse will win, she falls from her mount. Some time later Mickey reluctantly goes horseback riding with Reggie who tries to molest her in an abandoned house. Herbert arrives on the scene, battles Reggie, and rescues Mickey as she is dangling dangerously from the rooftop. Mickey and Herbert are married. As they depart on their honeymoon, a note arrives from lawyer Rawlings explaining the earlier telegram about his mining interests being worthless was a ruse designed to get Herbert out of his loveless engagement to Elsie Drake. The film ends with both Mickey and Herbert happily in love, wed, and exceedingly wealthy. ==Delay in widespread release== Despite its eventual popularity, Mickey was not widely shown for more than a year. According to Mack Sennett's 1954 autobiography, King of Comedy, the film was perceived to be a flop and initial response by distributors was resoundingly negative. This attitude perplexed Sennett because he thought Mickey was the best film his studio had ever produced for Mabel Normand. He believed the script gave Normand tremendous scope and range for her whimsical talents. Nevertheless, Sennett continued to publicize the movie in trade publications to keep it in the minds of the theater owners. After about two years, however, Sennett learned that a small theater in Bayside, Long Island was unexpectedly without any film to screen one night and the proprietor was desperate. Sennett quickly offered him a copy of Mickey. Having no alternative, he eagerly accepted Sennett's suggestion. With only minimal advertising, Mickey attracted an enormous crowd and the audience's response was very favorable. Shortly thereafter, other theaters clamored for prints of the film too. By the time Mickey had become a box office hit, Mabel Normand was no longer under contract to Mack Sennett, having signed a lucrative five-year deal with Sam Goldwyn. ==Title song== \\"Mickey\\" is also the title of a song adapted from the movie, with lyrics by Harry Williams and music by Neil Moret (pseudonym for Charles N. Daniels), copyrighted in 1918 and published by Daniels & Wilson of San Francisco and New York. The song can be heard in some public domain releases of the film. ==Cast== *Mabel Normand as Mickey *George Nichols as Joe Meadows *Wheeler Oakman as Herbert Thornhill *Minta Durfee as Elsie Drake *Laura La Varnie as Mrs. Geoffrey Drake *Lew Cody as Reggie Drake *Tom Kennedy as Tom Rawlings *Minnie Devereaux as Minnie ==Reception== Mickey was the highest- grossing film of 1918, with a worldwide gross of $8 million and made on a budget of $250,000. Mickey was re-released each year into 1921. During that time, about 40.9 million tickets were sold for the film. That set a record that wasn't broken until 1938. The film was widely celebrated by critics. A review in The Tattler said \\"No photoplay yet produced is so filled with adventure, thrills and human emotions as Mickey.\\" A critic in Moving Picture World wrote \\"Mickey is a digest of the science of producing motion pictures.

She was the daughter of a German piano tuner and a rich Brazilian young woman from the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Her mother was disinherited by her father because her parents did not approve of living with a man without being married, and Bengel lived in humble conditions in Copacabana. At the age of 10, her parents separated, and because her mother could not support her financially, Bengel lived with her father and paternal grandparents in Germany. Being a rebellious young woman, she was interned in a college of nuns, and then expelled, and she abandoned her studies, returning to live in Brazil with her mother. After a difficult time, she began working in the early 1950s, first as a model and then as the star of the magazine theater, where she developed her singing career. ==Career== Bengell was active in the film industry from 1959. She appeared in numerous international productions, including an extended period during the mid-1960s co-starring in Italian productions, in which she was usually cast as the protagonist's romantic interest.

The Transit Cafe would later be taken over by James J. Bulger and managed by Winter Hill Gang mob associate Kevin Weeks. His organization included Whitey Bulger, William S. O'Sullivan, and Jack Curran. He engaged in a turf war with South Boston's Mullen Gang. ==Personal life== Donald's brother George was the first brother to be murdered, found shot to death in the North End neighborhood in 1950. His murderers were never discovered. In 1971 when Kenneth chewed off the nose of Michael (Mickey) Dwyer, rival Boston gang member and former brother-in-law of Boston Police Department Commissioner Francis (Mickey) Roche, he wrapped it up with a cocktail napkin and sent it to Boston City Hospital in a cab to Dwyer to be reattached. Donald's other brother, Edward, was found shot to death in 1968; it was listed by the county coroner as an apparent suicide. In 1968 he became a father to a son. ==Death== He was killed outside his home in suburban Framingham, Massachusetts, on May 13, 1972, as he was called away by an associate on his son Gregory's fourth birthday. He left the house saying he was going to fetch a newspaper but in reality was going to get his son's present, a toy fire engine, in the trunk of his 1971 Chevrolet Nova. As Donald went to fetch a gun stashed underneath the driver's seat of his car, a gunman pulled open the car door and jammed the machine gun in his face before squeezing off fifteen rounds. Bulger was accused of the murder by longtime rumor. However, former Mullen gang member Patrick Nee stated that the murder was actually committed by Mullen enforcer Jimmy Mantville. ==Aftermath== The last and youngest brother, Kenny Killeen, was jogging past a parked car with four men in it in the City Point neighborhood of Boston. the men in the car were Whitey Bulger, Stephen Flemmi and John Martorano. He said that Bulger called him over to the car and said, \\"It's over. You're out of business.

Tongue tie visible below the bit on California Chrome A tongue-tie is a piece of equipment used by equestrians to prevent a horse from getting its tongue over the bit, which would make the animal very difficult to control. It is usually a strip of cloth or rubber, passed through the mouth and tied below the chin. Tongue ties are illegal in competitive events such as most horse show disciplines, but very common in other sports, such as horse racing. The device is controversial in some circles where its use considered abusive. However, due to the life or death safety and control issues inherent in certain extreme equestrian sports, such as horse racing, it is considered by its proponents as a necessary tool for some animals. Sometimes it is viewed as necessary to prevent the horse's tongue from moving, either to move the bit out of position, rendering it ineffective, or to keep the tongue from obstructing the airway if the horse puts its tongue over the bit. The horse's inability to \\"accept\\" the bit, whether it be that it was broken in abruptly, or due to assorted riders' heavy-handedness, is often given as another reason for use of a tongue tie. Some equine behaviorists argue that the need of a tongue tie is indication of a deeper underlying issue, and that the tongue tie itself is a mere crutch that does not solve the problem. Research has shown that the tongue-tie does not restrict the animal's breathing. However, research has also shown that the tongue-tie does not provide a respiratory benefit in healthy animals (as some trainers believe it prevents the horse's tongue from coming up, and therefore allows for free air intake).Ties do not Restrict Airflow in the Exercising Horse Other studies have shown that it does help prevent dorsal displacement of the soft palate, but success rate is low. ==References== Obligate nasal breathing Tongue ties do not improve horse respiration Category:Bit accessories ","title":"Tongue-tie (tack)"},{"id":"9101740","text":"River gorge in Lapalala Wilderness, Waterberg, South Africa.

The difficulty in defining terrorism stem from the fact that it is politically and emotionally charged. The history of terrorism incidence in Northern Ireland, Middle East and South East Asia indicate that terrorism is perpetrated by a group of aggrieved people that see violence as the only means of achieving their political goals. The loose definition of terrorism resulted in the execution of State-sanctioned terrorism as well as acts of terror carried out by militant groups, each trying to legitimise their act of terror. ===Linguistic definition=== Linguistically, terrorism is defined as: * Use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes * State of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorisation * Terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government ===Malaysia's effort in defining terrorism=== After the terrorist attack on World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001, Malaysia has actively emphasised on the need to define terrorism in view of increasingly discriminatory environment against the Muslims. During the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) meeting on 4 April 2002 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Prime Minister at the time Mahathir Mohamad proposed 'a definition for terrorism encompassing all violence targeted at civilians, which he said included 11 September attacks, Palestinian suicide bombers as well as assaults by Israel in the Palestinian territories'. However, the proposal was met with resistance from the Arab countries, for fear that it will criminalised the Palestinian struggle for statehood. ===Terrorism definition in Malaysia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation=== The Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Act 747) was enacted to specifically deal with terrorism. Under the Act, the following actions warrant the invocation of the law: * To cause, or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear, organised violence against persons or property * To excite disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Supreme Ruler) * Which is prejudicial to public order in, or the security of, the Federation or any part thereof * Procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of anything by law established Act 747 makes further reference to Chapter VI of the Penal Code (Act 574) that provides the basis for arrest for offences committed against the Federation. However, the now-repealed Internal Security Act 1960 (Act 82) provided a clear definition of a terrorist. A terrorist, under Act 82, meant any person who: * By the use of any firearm, explosive or ammunition acts in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or to the maintenance of public order or incites to violence or counsels disobedience to the law or to any lawful order * Carries or has in his possession or under his control any firearm, ammunition or explosive without lawful authority therefore * Demands, collects or receives any supplies for the use of any person who intends or is about to act, or has recently acted, in a manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order The National Security Council, Malaysia's top policy-making body with regard to national security, defined terrorism as: * Unlawful use of threat or the use of force or terror or any other attack by person, group or state regardless of objective or justification aim at other state, it citizens or their properties and its vital services with the intention of creating fear, intimidation and thus forcing government or organisation to follow their impressed will including those act in support directly or indirectlyhttp://www.mafsc.edu.my/administrator/uploads/publications/1318395749409911_LINK_THE%20ROLES%20OF%20ARMY%20INTELLIGENCE%20IN%20COMBATING.pdf (refer to Directive No. 18, issued by the National Security Council) ==History of terrorism in MalaysiaThe birth of the Malaysian Communist Party=== The South Seas Communist Party was established in 1922. The South Seas Communist Party gave way to the formation of Malayan Communist Party (MCP) in 1930. Throughout its formative years in Indonesia and Singapore, the party was actively involved in a failed revolution attempt in Indonesia and workers' union in Singapore. The failure of the 1925 uprising in Indonesia had caused a large influx of Indonesian communists into Singapore. Within the fourth decade of 20th century (1930-1939), the MCP was operating illegally. Many of party members and leaders were arrested when their identities were exposed with the capture of a Kuomintang courier. In 1939, the British had managed to install one of their agents, Lai Teck, as the Secretary General of the MCP. ===Japanese invasion=== The Japanese army invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941. The British administration in Singapore had then accepted the offer by the MCP to provide manpower. The British military administration trained the MCP volunteers and with the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, the British left Malaya, leaving behind a very nascent militia group. This nascent militia group was known as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). The MPAJA continued with their guerilla warfare against the Japanese forces until the Japanese surrendered in 1945. There was a power vacuum in Malaya after the Japanese troop left. The MPAJA members went out from their jungle hideouts and begun their reprisal campaign against Japanese collaborators, the police regiment and civilians. Their reprisal campaign could have been the first known terrorism acts against the general population, ===Formation of the British Military Administration and the establishment of the Malayan Union=== The interim British Military Administration (BMA) was established on 12 September 1945, headed by Lord Louis Mountbatten. The BMA urged the MPAJA to surrender their weapons, which they reluctantly agreed. By 1948, the BMA was facing growing threat of strikes by the labour unions, which was infiltrated by communist agents. This culminated in the murder of 3 European planters at Sungai Siput, Perak on 12 June 1948. The death of the planters at Sungai Siput mark the beginning of the Malayan Emergency and the act was considered as an act of terror. The Malayan Union was formally established on 1 April 1946 and Sir Edward Gent was appointed as its first Governor. ===The Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960)=== The Malayan Union was replaced by the Federation of Malaya on 31 January 1948. The creation of the Federation run contrary to the vision of the MCP to establish a communist state in Malaya. The proclamation of Emergency was announced on 16 June 1948. Following the proclamation of Emergency, hundreds of MCP party members were arrested and scores of MCP's senior leadership and members fled into the jungle. The remnants of MCP then established Malayan People's Anti-British Army (MPABA). The MPABA was later renamed as Malayan People's Liberation Army (MPLA) on 1 February 1949, with the aim of establishing a People's Democratic Republic of Malaya (including Singapore). During this period, the MPLA conducted campaign of terror against civilian population, including intimidation, murder and coercion. Amnesty and Baling Talks On 27 July 1955, the Federation of Malaya held its first general election, which was won by the Alliance coalition. Tunku Abdul Rahman became the Federation's first Chief Minister. Earlier in the same year, Tunku had proposed to grant amnesty to the MCP members and leadership, on condition that the MCP would lay down their arms, disband the MCP, submit to speedy investigation and allegiance to the Federation. The MCP on the other hand, would like to have their party to be recognised, communist members be given their right of return to the Federation and assurance that no communist party members will be interrogated and made to sign a declaration of loyalty to the Federation. The amnesty offer was announced on 8 September 1955. Baling Talks was undertaken by the administration of Tunku Abdul Rahman on 28 December 1955. The talks collapsed without any deal sealed as the Federation delegation, led by Tunku himself and the MCP, led by its Secretary General, Ong Boon Hwa, better known as Chin Peng, refused to compromise. The amnesty offer was withdrawn on 8 February 1956. ===Independence and the war against Communist=== The Federation of Malaya achieved its independence on 31 August 1957. The independence removed the major cause of struggle for the communists. The communists continue to dwindle in strength and the Emergency was officially revoked on 31 July 1960. However, the MCP launched another major offensive against Malaysian government forces, beginning with an attack on border patrol troop at Kroh-Betong, northern Peninsula Malaysia on 17 June 1968. Skirmishes, bombings and assassinations continued until the signing of a tripartite peace treaty between Malaysian and Thai Governments as well as the MCP on 2 December 1989. ===Post-independence and until present=== War on Terror and Islamic extremism In July 2000, an Islamic militant group called Al-Ma'unah stole weapons from a Malaysian Army camp in an attempt to overthrow the Malaysian Government. The group was later cornered in the village of Sauk, Perak and was involved in a stand-off the against the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysian Police forces. Following a five-day standoff, the siege came to an end when Malaysian security forces, including the army 22nd Grup Gerak Khas (22nd GGK) and police VAT 69 Pasukan Gerakan Khas, stormed the camp in Operation Dawn. On 6 April 2015, Malaysian authorities arrested seventeen suspected militants who were involved in an alleged terror plot in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Two of the suspects were alleged to have been fighting for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in Syria. These arrests coincided with the Malaysian Government's plans to introduce two new anti-terror bills: the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Special Measures Against Terrorism in Foreign Countries Act. ==PolicyMalaysia's Policy on terrorism=== Official Policy Malaysia's policy on terrorism is clearly stipulated in Directive No. 18 (Revised) issued by the National Security Council. Malaysia is putting the emphasis on: * Denouncing any form of terrorist acts * Protection of hostages' life and property * Preference for negotiated solutions * No exchange of hostage to resolve the crisis * Strike action as a last resort following failure of negotiation Total Defence (HANRUH) concept Since 2006, the Malaysian Government has implemented the concept of total defence (HANRUH) as part of the national defence doctrine. The Malaysian Government defined the total defence concept as a form of overall and integrated defence involving government agencies, private sectors, non-governmental bodies and citizens of Malaysia to protect the sovereignty and integrity of Malaysia. Under this concept, the Malaysian Government has identified 5 total defence components: * Psychological integrity * Consolidation and unity of Malaysians * Public preparedness * Economic integrity * Security preparedness Psychological integrity Under the component of psychological integrity, the vision is to prepare the Malaysian citizens to continuously ready and committed to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the country. The main objectives are to instil the following among the citizens: * Sense of patriotism and nationalism * Sense of love to the country * Sense of pride to be Malaysians * Sense of readiness to sacrifice for the country * Sense of harmony, unity and national integration * Well-informed citizens ===Preparedness against terrorism=== Consolidation and Unity of Malaysians The vision of consolidation and unity of Malaysians is to create a harmonious and unified Malaysian race (Bangsa Malaysia) regardless of status, race, religion, culture and origin. The main objectives are to instil the following among the citizens: * Caring * Tolerance * Collaboration * Share similar vision and goal * Respect religious diversity Public preparedness Public preparedness focuses on two main aspects, namely: * Provision of sufficient access to protection of life and property * Ensure security and continuous supply of basic amenities in the event of war, emergency and disaster To ensure that the above focuses achieve its intended vision, the Malaysian Government has established the following as part of the implementation strategy: * Rescue and emergency assistance services * Fire safety brigade * Food supply and distribution services * Assign Malaysia Civil Defence Department as the lead agency to co-ordinate and implement all public preparedness programs in collaboration with public emergency response services and other volunteer associations Economic integrity The economic integrity component seeks to ensure solid economic prosperity and continuous competitiveness level. Three main factors identified under this component are: * Stockpile of necessity items * Staple food supply as a national strategic asset * Ensuring transportation, energy and water supply continue to be provided without interruption and not under threat The action plan for economic integrity is formulation of a national agriculture policy to reduce dependency on imported products and diversify national production. Security preparedness Security preparedness involve the policing and military forces of the country. The main task for the police force is to ensure public order, providing assistance to other government agencies, protecting lives and properties as well as assisting the cause of war. The military is responsible to protect national interest and sovereignty. ==Terror groups, members and attacksTerrorist groups=== A number of extreme groups that have been designated as terrorist groups in Malaysia are: Local Jihadist faction''' * Al-Ma'unah (defeated and dissolved) * Darul Islamiah Malaysia (defunct) * Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (defunct) * Tanzim Qaedat al-Jihad (defunct) Others faction * Malayan Communist Party (defeat and dissolved) Foreign Jihadist faction * Abu Sayyaf * Al- Qaeda * Darul Islam * Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) * Jemaah Islamiyah Pirate faction * Indonesian pirates * Moro pirates * Somali pirates Others faction * Japanese Red Army (dissolved) * Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam * Sultanate of Sulu (Jamalul Kiram III faction) (defeated) * Moro National Liberation Front (Nur Misuari faction) ===Notable terrorist members=== Malaysian Three Malaysian terrorists: Mohamed Amin Mohamed Razali, Jamaludin Darus and Zahid Muslim who were a members of the Al-Ma'unah that was involved in the Sauk Siege have been executed by hanging in 2006. Azahari Husin and Noordin Mohammed Top (both have been killed by authorities in Indonesia) are responsible for the bombing incidents in Indonesia.

It was the first fatal accident for Malaysia Airlines (as Malaysian Airline System is now known), with all 93 passengers and 7 crew, from 13 countries,\\"Names list on the Tanjung Kupang Memorial plaque\\" killed instantly. The Boeing 737 was en route from Penang International Airport to Singapore International Airport (Paya Lebar) via Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. The circumstances in which the hijacking and subsequent crash occurred remain unsolved. AIA Building hostage crisis On 5 August 1975, a group of Japanese Red Army (JRA) terrorists launched a coordinated operation against several foreign embassies, housed in AIA Building in Kuala Lumpur city centre. They took 50 hostages, including an American consul and a Swedish diplomat.

Prior to the Gates Foundation, Dryden had a distinguished track record as an investor and developer of life-sciences ventures with extensive expertise in the scale-up and commercialization of early-stage agricultural technologies worldwide, as well as public-private partnerships like being the private sector representative in the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Sylvia Matthews Burwell, President of the Global Development Program at the Gates Foundation, summed up Dryden's track record: \\"Sam brings a wealth of experience to the foundation‚Äînot only in agriculture, research, and business, but also in a wide variety of projects related to agricultural development and public-private partnerships. His strong leadership qualities will help the team deliver on our strategy to help small farmers improve their lives.\\" Dryden used to be Managing Director of Wolfensohn & Company, a private investment and advisory firm founded by James Wolfensohn, former President of the World Bank. There he focused primarily on private equity investments in alternative energies. Until June 2006, he served as the Chair and Corporate CEO of Emergent Genetics, Inc. ‚Äî a global leader in the development and marketing of biotechnology-enhanced seed products.

Dryden's ability to reach out to critics like Pat Mooney and Grist, to explain the Gates Foundation's approach was as crucial as his strategic vision and management experience to reorient the agriculture program. Under his leadership, the Gates Foundation began an intensive engagement to bring the international food and agriculture system in service of increasing small-holder farmer productivity - refer, Bill Gates' Address to IFAD's Governing Council - to achieve the global hunger and poverty goals, as listed in the Millennium Declaration. These efforts helped reform and rejuvenate global institutions, like the CGIARWorld Bank, CGIAR is high value investment: Bill Gates, URL: http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/03/14/investing-in-agriculture- bill-gates-highlights-value-of-cgiar (which underwent significant reforms and doubled its budget), and the Gates Foundation developed strong partnerships with FAO under its new leader Jose Graziano da Silva,http://www.fao.org/about/who-we-are/director-gen/faodg-news- archive/detail/en/c/178804/ WFP under its new leader Ertharin Cousin, and IFAD under Kanayo Nwanze.https://www.devex.com/news/bill-gates-proposes- accountability-scorecards-for-agriculture-development-77572 The Gates Foundation also made some of its most innovative grants, like Digital Green, One Acre Fund, during Dryden's directorship- he continues this work in his new capacity as Imperial College Fellow to promote digital technologies to improve African food systems by better linking small-holders in the value chain. This work builds on the convening led by Kofi Annan and AU Chair Zuma in Addis Ababa.

Born in the West Indies, he joined the free black immigrants from the United States who migrated to the region. He taught for five years in the British West African Colony of Sierra Leone in the early 20th century. His writings on pan- Africanism were influential in both colonies. These were founded during the slavery years for the resettlement of free blacks from Great Britain and the United States. Blyden's writings attracted attention in the sponsoring countries as well. He believed that Zionism was a model for what he called Ethiopianism, and that African Americans could return to Africa and redeem it. He believed political independence to be a prerequisite for economic independence, and argued that Africans must counter the neo-colonial policies of former colonial powers. Blyden was recognised in his youth for his talents and drive; he was educated and mentored by John Knox, an American Protestant minister in St Thomas, Danish West Indies, who encouraged him to continue his education in the United States. In 1850 Blyden was refused admission to three Northern theological seminaries because of his race. Knox encouraged him to go to Liberia, the colony set up for freedmen by the American Colonization Society; Blyden emigrated that year, in 1850, and made his career and life there. He married into a prominent family and soon started working as a journalist. ==Early life and education== Edward Wilmot Blyden Edward Wilmot Blyden c. 1887 Blyden was born on 3 August 1832 in Sankt Thomas, Danish West Indies (now known as the US Virgin Islands), to Free Black parents who claimed descent from the Igbo of the area of present-day Nigeria. Between 1842 and 1845 the family lived in Porto Bello, Venezuela, where Blyden discovered a facility for languages, becoming fluent in Spanish. According to the historian Hollis R. Lynch, in 1845 Blyden met the Reverend John P. Knox, a white American, who became pastor of the St. Thomas Protestant Dutch Reformed Church.Hollis R. Lynch, Edward Wilmot Blyden: Pan-Negro Patriot, 1832‚Äì1912, New York: Oxford University Press, 1967, p. 4. Blyden and his family lived near the church, and Knox was impressed with the studious, intelligent boy. Knox became his mentor, encouraging Blyden's considerable aptitude for oratory and literature. Mainly because of his close association with Knox, the young Blyden decided to become a minister, which his parents encouraged. In May 1850, Blyden, accompanied by Reverend Knox's wife, went to the United States to enroll in Rutgers Theological College, Knox's alma mater. He was refused admission due to his race. Efforts to enroll him in two other theological colleges also failed. Knox encouraged Blyden to go to Liberia, the colony set up in the 1830s by the American Colonization Society (ACS) in West Africa, where he thought Blyden would be able to use his talents.Lynch, Edward Wilmot Blyden, 1967. Later in 1850, Blyden sailed to Liberia. He soon became deeply involved in its development. Starting in 1860, Blyden corresponded with William Ewart Gladstone, who would later become a significant Liberal leader and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gladstone offered Blyden an opportunity to study in England in 1861, but Blyden declined due to his obligations in Liberia.Lynch, Selected Letters of Edward Wilmot Blyden, 1978. ==Marriage, family and legacy== Blyden married Sarah Yates, an Americo- Liberian from the prominent Yates family. She was the daughter of Hilary Yates and his wife. Her paternal uncle, Beverly Page Yates, served as vice-president of Liberia from 1856 to 1860 under President Stephen Allen Benson. Blyden and Sarah had three children together. Later while living for several years in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Blyden had a long-term relationship with Anna Erskine, an African-American woman from Louisiana. She was a granddaughter of James Spriggs-Payne, who was twice elected as the President of Liberia. Blyden and Erskine had five children together. In the 21st century, those Blyden direct descendants living in Sierra Leone are from this union. They have been considered part of the Krio population. Among his descendants living in Freetown is Sylvia Blyden, publisher of the Awareness Times. Blyden's descendants continue his legacy of contributing to Africa's development in their respective industries of expertise. Great-grandson Bai Blyden is making an impact in the sustainable energy space empowering Africa through his work with IEEE. Blyden died on 7 February 1912 in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where he was buried at Racecourse Cemetery. In honour of him, the 20th-century Pan- Africanist George Padmore named his daughter Blyden.Hooker, James Ralph, Black Revolutionary: George Padmore's Path from Communism to Pan-Africanism, London: Pall Mall Press, 1967; New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. ==Career== Emigrating to Liberia in 1850, Blyden soon was working in journalism. From 1855 to 1856, he edited the Liberia Herald and wrote the column \\"A Voice From Bleeding Africa.\\" He also spent time in British colonies in West Africa, particularly Nigeria and Sierra Leone, writing for early newspapers in both colonies. He was also serving as editor at The Negro and The African World. He maintained ties with the American Colonization Society and published in their African Repository and Colonial Journal. In 1861, Blyden became professor of Greek and Latin at Liberia College. He was selected as president of the college, serving 1880‚Äì1884 during a period of expansion. As a diplomat, Blyden served as an ambassador for Liberia to Britain and France. He also traveled to the United States, where he spoke to major black churches about his work in Africa. Blyden believed that Black Americans could end their suffering of racial discrimination by returning to Africa and helping to develop it. He was criticized by African Americans who wanted to gain full civil rights in their birth nation of the United States and did not identify with Africa.Runoko Rashidi post, \\"Africa for the Africans\\", The Global African Community ‚Äì personal website, 1998, accessed 3 January 2011. In suggesting a redemptive role for African Americans in Africa through what he called Ethiopianism, Blyden likened their suffering in the diaspora to that of the Jews; he supported the 19th-century Zionist project of Jews returning to Palestine.Black Zion : African American Religious Encounters with Judaism, edited by Yvonne Chireau, Nathaniel Deutsch; Oxford University Press, 1999, Google eBook, p. 15 Later in life, Blyden became involved in Islam, and concluded that it was a more \\"African\\" religion than Christianity for African Americans and Americo-Liberians. Participating in the development of the country, Blyden was appointed the Liberian Secretary of State (1862‚Äì64). He was later appointed as Secretary of the Interior (1880‚Äì82). Blyden contested the 1885 presidential election for the Republican Party, but lost to incumbent Hilary R. W. Johnson. From 1901‚Äì06, Blyden directed the education of Muslims at an institution in Sierra Leone, where he lived in Freetown. This is when he had his relationship with Anna Erskine; they had five children together. He became passionate about Islam during this period, recommending it to African Americans as the major religion most in keeping with their historic roots in Africa. ==Writings== As a writer, Blyden is regarded widely as the \\"father of Pan-Africanism\\" and is noted as one of the first people to articulate a notion of \\"African Personality\\" and the uniqueness of the \\"African race.\\" His ideas have influenced many twentieth-century figures including Marcus Garvey, George Padmore and Kwame Nkrumah. His major work, Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race (1887), promoted the idea that practicing Islam was more unifying and fulfilling for Africans than Christianity. He argues that the latter was introduced chiefly by European colonizers. He believed it had a demoralizing effect, although he continued to be a Christian. He thought Islam was more authentically African, as it had been brought to sub-Saharan areas by people from North Africa. His book was controversial in Great Britain. At first many people did not believe that a black African had written it; his promotion of Islam was disputed. In later printings, Blyden included his photograph as the frontispiece.Eluemuno-Chukuemeka R. Blyden, \\"Edward Wilmot Blyden and Africanism in America\\", A Virtual Museum of the Life and Work of Edward Wilmot Blyden (1832‚Äì1912), 1995, Columbia University; accessed 3 January 2011. His book included the following: > 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with out African > personality and be lost, if possible, in another Race.' This is as wise or > as philosophical as to say, let us do away with gravitation, with heat and > cold and sunshine and rain. Of course, the Race in which these persons would > be absorbed is the dominant race, before which, in cringing self-surrender > and ignoble self-suppression they lie in prostrate admiration. Due to his belief in Ethiopianism, in the late 19th century Blyden publicly supported the creation of a Jewish state in Israel; he praised Theodore Herzl as the creator of \\"that marvelous movement called Zionism.\\"George Bornstein, \\"The Colors of Zion: Black, Jewish, and Irish Nationalisms at the turn of the Century\\", Modernism/modernity 12.3 (2005), Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 369‚Äì84. ==WorksBooks=== * Call of Providence to the Descendants of Africa in America\\", A Discourse Delivered to Coloured Congregations in the Cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Harrisburg, during the Summer of 1862, in Liberia's Offering: Being Addresses, Sermons, etc., New York: John A.

It was created by actress Rosario Dawson, writer David Atchison and illustrator Tony Shasteen. Dawson also lends her likeness to main character Sophia Ortiz. ==Publication history== The series debuted in O.C.T.: Occult Crimes Taskforce Heroes Con Preview #1, published in June 2006 by 12 Gauge Comics. O.C.T.: Occult Crimes Taskforce #1 debuted July 2006 after a move to 12 Gauge Comics and Image Comics.Occult Crimes Taskforce Moves to 12 Gauge and Image Comics, press release ==Background== The Occult Crimes Taskforce is a fictitious group of New York Police investigators who patrol a district of New York primarily populated by practitioners of magic. The \\"Otherground\\", as the denizens refer to it, is the 'Extant', the location that connects the Earth with another dimension. ===Overview=== There is an old and forgotten resolution in recesses of the City of New York Annotated Code of Ordinances mandating the creation of a taskforce in the Manhattan Police Department specifically designed to deal with crimes of occult origin. The primary mission of the OCT‚Äôs is to serve and protect the Manhattan populace from magical contaminations, Rogue Ceteri (creatures from the dimension beyond) and Tainted, practitioners who exploit magic for personal gain at expense of the citizenry. Contrary to general assumption, the OCT is not a large, sweeping conspiracy. It is a small, elite task force of officers dealing with a problem only they can. The entire operation is no larger than 250 full-time officers, investigators and auxiliary personnel. The OCT precinct is located near the epicenter of the Extant in an area of Manhattan informed Tainted and Ceteri refer to as the ‚ÄúOtherground.‚Äù Due to the Otherground‚Äôs proximity to the Extant's epicenter, it is a hotbed of magical activity and a haven for Ceteri and Tainted alike. Like Shangri La, Avalon and the Garden of Eden, only Tainted individuals and Ceteri can actually see the Otherground and spells of concealment prevent the average person from viewing it. ==Fictional history1600s=== In Occult Crimes Taskforce (OCT) continuity historians claim Peter Minuit purchased the Isle of Manhattan in 1626 from Wappinger Indian Tribe for 60 Dutch Guilders or $24. What the historians don‚Äôt know is why the tribe sold the island for such a low price. The Wappingers had been plagued by demons, ravaged by werewolves and haunted by spirits. Their shamans cast a spell blocking passage from the Alternate Universe, but knew the spell was a temporary solution at best. When Minuit made his offer the Wappingers saw it as an opportunity to avenge themselves for the injustices they suffered at the hands of the early settlers. Things remained peaceful on Manhattan for nearly two centuries, but eventually the Wappinger‚Äôs barrier dissolved and conflict arose. Those closest to the extant center suffered the worst casualties. Those living farther out saw their lives minimally effected. The OCT was created shortly after the barrier breach as a means of minimizing MERlin contamination and protecting citizens. With the barrier broken and magical energies once again flowing from the extant, the area around the epicenter began to attract magical beings from across the planet. ===1800s=== Formed in the 19th century, the Occult Crimes Taskforce is a covert police unit composed of the Manhattan Investigators and ‚ÄúCeteri‚Äù, supernatural beings from the dimension beyond, who have pledged their existence to the protection of mankind. Together, man and monster have secretly defended Manhattan for over 200 years. ==Collected editions== The series has been collected in a trade paperback: *Occult Crimes Taskforce (152 pages, Image Comics, June 2007, ) ==Other mediaFilm=== The Occult Crimes Taskforce film rights were acquired by Dimension Films in September 2006. ===Television series=== A&E; Network announced that they were working on an OCT TV show in March 2012, with Jorge Zamacona as the script writer. He is also a producer along with the comic's creators Dawson, Atchison, Gilmore and Shasteen, and The Walking Dead producer Gale Anne Hurd. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * *12 Gauge Comics * ===Reviews=== *Review of OCT #1, another and issue #2, Comics Bulletin Category:2006 comics debuts ","title":"Occult Crimes Taskforce"},{"id":"9101977","text":"Thumbtanic is a 2002 short film, directed by Todd Portugal and written by Steve Oedekerk, which parodies the 1997 film Titanic. It is a part of the Thumbs! series, created by Steve Oedekerk and produced by O Entertainment. The film runs approximately 26 minutes in length. ==Storyline== The film begins with a couple of submarines going down to the wreck of the Thumbtanic. They find a picture of a naked woman and it is put on the news. The woman, Geranium (now old), picks up the phone without dialing and says that she's the woman then falls asleep. The news reporters arrive and the news anchorman verbally abuses Geranium, only causing her to fall asleep again, falling on the ground. She gets up by herself and then she tells her story of Thumbtanic. In 1912, when old people were really young, over 2,000 thumbs are boarding the Thumbtanic. A young Geranium arrives in the 'sex scene' car and boards the ship. Jake, a strapping young thumb, thumb wrestles with a big guy and wins a ticket on the Thumbtanic. He tries to get on, but is stopped for a lice check. When he says he has no lice, the crewmen give him some, but he shakes them away. As the ship is sailing Geranium complains to a maid about being rich and wanting to be poor. The maid tells her she's crazy and is hit by a door. The captain asks Geranium if he wants to see his wheelhouse, and taking this to mean he wants to have sex with her, Geranium punches him. The captain insists he just means the ship's wheelhouse, and Geranium then agrees to go with him. There, she meets the ship's designer, who optimistically informs her that the ship has two lifeboats. One is intended to hold 24 of the \\"key nautical crew\\" and the other will hold everyone else. Geranium points out that the ship has over 2,000 thumbs on board, puzzling the designer, who had not noticed this before. Jake sees Geranium and he says he likes the big fat thumbs and Geranium hopes that he likes thumbs that are big. Then Jake and many other passengers scream messages while standing on the bow of the ship. An important passenger, Mr. Prickle, visits the captain and demands that the ship go faster. The captain responds by ordering the engine room to \\"increase speed beyond reason\\". That night Jake saves Geranium, persuading her not to commit suicide as she had been intending to do. Stevine Odion sings \\"My Heart is a Thumb\\" while Jake and Geranium spend time together and then have sex in the sex scene car. Then the Thumbtanic hits an iceberg and there is major flooding. Jake and Geranium exit the car and head onto the now tilted deck. A senior crewman attempts to calm the passengers, but the captain suddenly screams \\"We're all going to die!\\" causing mass panic. Mr. Prickle appears, loudly demanding that the ship sink faster. He leaves, declaring his intention to die the fastest, heading for the low end of the Thumbtanic. The captain consults the ship's designer, who calmly suggests such solutions as a \\"heating fan the size of Africa\\" to dry up the ocean. He brings out a blueprint and begins discussing it, but the captain interrupts \\"This isn't useful; this is a monkey.\\" The designer realizes it is, but then notes there is an escape portal in the tail of the monkey. The captain panics again, running off screaming, while the designer continues to study the monkey. On deck, a man sells babies, then sex changes (with an axe) to male passengers. A giant tarantula crawls on the ship, but Jake shoots it back into the sea with a laser from \\"Thumb Wars.\\" The ship then goes up to a 45 degree angle and then goes backwards and has the bow stick in the air, then it goes back to the stern in the air. A rocket is fired off, just before the Thumbtanic breaks in half and sinks. One thumb, observing in the water, notes that recreating the event on film would be extremely expensive. The captain, still on the bridge, suddenly realizes that staying on board after the ship went underwater was a bad idea. Geranium and Jake bicker over who gets to stay on a floating table, shoving one another off repeatedly. They then see a lifeboat, but it is full to capacity with the designer and 23 other people in it. Jake gets an idea and all 2,000 passengers except the captain, Mr. Prickle and a man crushed by a piano are rescued by piling themselves on each other in the other lifeboat. The old Geranium adds that there were plenty of snacks to go around too, but she and Jake broke up the next day. She then falls asleep again and the anchorman steals the Blue Diamond Geranium had and gives it to the famous one-eyed thumb who was also on the Thumbtanic when it sank. A series of pictures show the one-eyed thumb enjoying his newfound wealth. The credits then play while Stevine Odion sings \\"My Heart is a Thumb\\" again. ==Running gags== A reference to Thumb Wars appears while everyone is talking about the ship getting hit by an iceberg. The first person to speak is a character from Thumb Wars who says, \\"We've been hit!\\" As with other Thumb films, a one-eyed thumb appears in the film three times (the only time it appears three times in the films). The first time happens while everyone is talking about the ship. The next is when the ship is tilting. It finishes the film by selling the diamond in the picture of Geranium. On the DVD menu, the one-eyed thumb appears as a prank. If the viewer browses the DVD menu long enough, the one-eyed thumb appears as he does in the feature before shutting the DVD player down. ==Releases== The film was released in 2002. It was also released in the \\"Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature,\\" along with Thumb Wars. Both were released on VHS and DVD in 2005. In 2005, it was released as a UMD Video on the PlayStation Portable system. ==External links== * Category:2002 short films Category:2002 films Category:2002 comedy films Category:2000s parody films Category:Films featuring puppetry Category:Films set in 1912 Category:Films set on ships Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Short films directed by Steve Oedekerk Category:American short films ","title":"Thumbtanic"},{"id":"9101987","text":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 46, adopted on April 17, 1948, having referenced the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 43 and noting that the United Kingdom was still the Mandatory Power in charge of the Palestinian territory, it was responsible for ending the conflict there and every member of the Council was due to aid it achieve such a peace.

They released three albums before splitting up in the mid-1990s. Their early sound saw them classified as shoegazing. ==History== The band was formed by siblings Rob and Sara Montejo, with Rick Hodgson, Steve Wagner, and Tim Supplee, all of whom worked together in a local record store, and had left or dropped out of college prior to forming the band. When Lush played at The Marquee Club in London, Smashing Orange provided the support, unfortunately Sara was unable to enter the UK as she was under 16, so the band played their European tour as a four-piece. The band was signed by UK label Native Records, their first release being the single \\"My Deranged Heart\\" in April 1991, gaining comparisons with the likes of My Bloody Valentine and Galaxie 500. Their sound has also been described as sounding \\"like Ride would if they had any balls about them\\".Lambert, Charles (1992) \\"Smashing Orange at Oxford Jericho Tavern, 28th November 1991\\", Spiral Scratch, 23rg Jan-5th Feb 1992 This was followed a month later by a self-titled mini-album, and in November of that year by second single \\"Not Very Much To See\\". While they were in the UK, Native arranged for them to record a session for the John Peel BBC radio show, which was broadcast in February 1992. Native released the mini albumAbove Ming Gardens in 1992. Their first full-length album, The Glass Bead Game, was released in 1992, with third album, 1994's No Return in the End seeing a shift in style towards a harder garage rock sound, and also a move to MCA Records. Sara Montejo had left earlier and Supplee had been replaced on drums by Stroller White, but a disappointing response to the album saw the band split soon after its release. An anthology of their early work, 1991 was issued by Elephant Stone Records in 2005. ==The Sky Drops== Rob Montejo went on to form Love American Style, releasing \\"Undo\\" on Oxygen Records. He then formed the short-lived, My Wig is On. They released an internet-only EP in 2002. In 2004, he released a self-titled internet-only full length.

He has served a ten-month prison term for bombing a McDonald's restaurant in the city of Trabzon, Turkey. He has been on trial for allegedly inciting Og√ºn Samast to assassinate Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. On January 16, 2012, Hayal was found guilty of soliciting Dink's murder by a Turkish court and sentenced to life imprisonment. The ruling was later abolished, and in a new trial Hayal was sentenced to 7 and a half years imprisonment in July 2019. Yasin Hayal is a former member of the Turkish ultra-nationalist Great Union Party; he was expelled before the assassination of Dink. ==Murder of Hrant Dink== Hayal is connected to the murder of journalist Hrant Dink on January 19, 2007, by giving the murderer, Og√ºn Samast, the idea and supplying him with a weapon and money. Hrant Dink, the editor-in-chief of the bilingual Turkish-Armenian newspaper Agos, was killed on January 19, 2007 in front of the Agos office in Istanbul by gunshots, fired from behind in broad daylight. The instigator of the murder, Erhan Tuncel, allegedly informed police officer Muhittin Zenit of the attack in advance. Zenit was unable to have Hayal apprehended due to orders from the Trabzon police department. Initially Hayal claimed innocence, citing absence; however, telephone records proved that he was in Istanbul on the day of the assassination. His attorney was Fuat Turgut, who is suspected of membership in a militant organization called Ergenekon. The Great Union Party financed his court expenses; however, its leader, Muhsin Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu adamantly denied any connection between his party and Ergenekon. During his last trial Hayal harassed Dink's wife, Rakel. In August 2008, his brother, Osman Hayal, was taken into custody for incitement. In October, Osman was indicted by prosecutors Selim Berna Altay and Fikret Se√ßen for abetment, on the grounds that he was allegedly in Istanbul when the crime took place. The charge carries a penalty of 22.5‚Äì35 years. ==McDonald's incident== Hayal bombed a McDonald's branch in Trabzon on 24 October 2004. He left the scene without his jacket, his leg injured. His mother, Huri, said that Yasin left home on 24 October after the noon prayer and returned at night. The next day, he left around the same time at noon, once again returning in the evening to break the Ramadan fast. However, he left home after dinner after telling his parents he would spend the night with a friend in college. The police did not question Hayal's family for some time. He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison. He was retried on 23 September 2008, after a higher court decided that the penalty for his six victims should be cumulative.

Thomas Cartwright arrived in New South Wales as a convict on board the transport Royal Admiral, which arrived in Australia in 1834. He spent his early years in Australia in the Yass and Illawarra areas and was given a conditional pardon in 1847. On 26 June 1841 he married Catherine Gormly at the Goondarin School house in the county of Camden by banns and with the concent of the Governor. Catherine's parents, two brothers and one sister were killed in a flood in 1852 at Gundagai. The Cartwrights moved to the Wagga Wagga district in the late 1850s. They worked as shepherds in the area. In September 1859‚Äì60, Thomas was arrested and tried for the murder of Catherine during a drunken binge in which he hit her across the head many times with a fire shovel.

It is based on Numbers 20:1 et seq., and describes the lack of water experienced by the children of Israel after the death of Miriam and the events at the rock from which water was obtained. It likewise covers Numbers 20:24-29, recounting in a touching manner the death of Aaron. ==Themes in the midrash== The presiding interest of the midrash is not ultimately the eulogization of Aaron, but is rather the psychological analysis of Moses's inner struggle upon being commanded to inform Aaron of his impending demise. In service of this theme, the midrash touches on various aspects of Moses's tense relationship with God and with the Children of Israel, and interweaves this psychological tension with other aggadic elements to create a more powerful drama The picture of Moses presented in the midrash is to some extent that of a martyr figure. Moses is unloved and barely tolerated by his own people (in stark contrast to their adoration of his brother), and is constantly upbraided by God for every remark which casts the people in a negative light. For example, the Israelites attack Moses for having taken them out of Egypt, and threaten his life, but when Moses reports to God this deteriorating situation, the response is: \\"Moses, how long will you continue to defame my children?\\" There is also conveyed in the midrash the sense that with death of Aharon, Moses is losing his only real colleague and confidant, and that neither God nor the Israelites are able to recognize this. Moses is despised both from on high and on low, but selflessly struggles on. == Outline of the story == The midrash begins with the death of Miriam, sister of Moses, upon which occurrence expired the well that the Israelites through Miriam's merit had grown accustomed to rely on for water. Moses and Aaron mourn their sister's death, but the people grow impatient with Moses (significantly, not with Aharon) for his extended crying, and complain to him of the lack of water. Moses pleads for the privacy to mourn his sister in peace, and reminds the people that they have other officials and elders to whom they can appeal, but the people are implacable and threaten to stone Moses immediately if he does not produce water. Moses speaks with God about the situation, but finds no sympathy. He then leads the Israelites in search of water, but is conflicted about his own capacity to work the miracle of bringing water from a rock. He wonders what humiliation may transpire should he command the rock to bring forth water, and it does not. Thereupon he strikes a rock twice, and it pours fourth not water, but blood. There then ensues a three-way conversation between Moses, God, and the rock, in which again God takes the opportunity to castigate Moses for failure to follow instructions. Moses is then notified regarding his own death, but begs a deferment to a later time. While God acquiesces to the request, he also informs Moses that he must now approach Aaron concerning his brother's imminent demise. Moses protests that he cannot be the one to inform his older brother that his life has reached its conclusion; that this task is too emotionally difficult for him. While God again displays no sympathy for Moses, he does instruct Moses on how to break the news gently to Aaron, by accompanying Aaron and his son Eleazar to Mount Hor and there transferring Aaron's priestly garments to Eleazar (thus indicating to Aaron the nature of the circumstances). Nevertheless, Moses is greatly distraught at the task which God has given him, and at the prospect of his brother's death, weeping the entire night. In the morning, Moses relates to Aaron that God has a message for him, while deferring its revelation to a later time. However, this particular day, Moses changes the order in which the priests and dignitaries walk to the Tent of Meeting, placing Aaron in the center position of honor, much to the delight of the people. Still, he does not explain to Aaron the reason for the change, nor can he later explain the matter to Aaron when they and Eleazar walk together to the mountain. Moses tries in a gently elliptical manner to explain to Aaron that the latter's death is at hand, asking hypothetically whether Aaron was loaned something from God which God might now want returned; however, Aaron does not perceive Moses's meaning. A cave then opens in front of the three, and Moses bids Aaron to enter. Moses wishes now to for Aaron to remove the priestly vestments (as God had suggested), but again is at a loss for words. So, one more in an elliptical manner, Moses requests that Aaron leave the vestments with Eleazar outside the cave because they might otherwise become defiled in the cave (where there may be graves, Moses points out). Aaron thinks it a wise idea, and leaves the vestments with Eleazar outside, but yet remains innocent of the nature of the circumstances. Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. Aaron now inquires what message Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself. (Aaron is appeased by this argument, being evidently oblivious to the pathos therein.) The cave vanishes as Moses leaves it, and Moses then explains to an anxious Eleazar that his father has gone to Paradise. Upon Moses's return from the mountain, the Israelites disbelieve the news of Aaron's death, and accuse Moses of perhaps murdering his own brother! Moses pleads with God to display for the people Aaron's death bed, since otherwise they might make of Aaron a god. God accedes to this request, displaying Aaron on his deathbed, and the Israelites mourn the passing of Aaron and witness the departure of the clouds of the Presence, which accompanied the Israelites in Aaron's merit. With the departure of the clouds, the Israelites who were born in the desert are for the first time able to see the sun and the moon, which they are tempted now to worship. The midrash ends abruptly with an injunction from God to not do so. ==Textual aspects== On the beginning of the midrash, which is based on Zechariah 11:8, compare Taanit 9a and Sifre Deuteronomy 305. The midrash cites no authorities for its statements, but several statements are introduced by the formula ◊ï◊ê◊ñ\\"◊ú (i.e., ◊ï◊ê◊û◊®◊ï ◊ñ\\"◊ú, \\"they of blessed memory said\\"). ==Editions== The midrash was edited at Constantinople (1516), Venice (1544), and elsewhere, and has been reprinted by A.

He was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football at West Virginia. He has also played for the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, New York Jets, and Chicago Bears. ==Early years== Reynaud from Luling, Louisiana was born to Katrina and Michael Reynaud. Reynaud was awarded the St. Charles parish offensive MVP award in high school after leading Hahnville High School to an undefeated record and the state championship as a senior. He recorded 236 carries for 1,889 yards and 37 touchdowns as a Running back his senior season, with nine 100-yard rushing games. His stats earned him First-team All-State, All-District, All-6-5A and All-River Parish honors. He also was the Louisiana state long jump champion with a 24.5' jump. Although he was an offensive and long jump star in high school, Reynaud only received scholarship offers from Indiana and West Virginia. He eventually signed as one of the last recruits with the Mountaineers. ==College career2004-2007=== Darius Reynaud enrolled at West Virginia University in 2004. Reynaud did not participate in any games his true freshman year due to grades, but was not red shirted. During the 2005 season, Reynaud was accompanied with freshman-stars Pat White and Steve Slaton, and sophomore fullback Owen Schmitt. Reynaud was backup to red shirt-junior receiver Brandon Myles, but still recorded 297 yards on 30 catches. He had a career-first touchdown in the win against Wofford, a 27-yard catch from Adam Bednarik. In the Sugar Bowl win against the Georgia Bulldogs, Reynaud scored in the first quarter with a three-yard reception and a 13-yard reverse-run, and totaled 48 yards receiving. During the 2006 season, Reynaud's junior season, he started opposite Brandon Myles. Reynaud recorded a career- high 520 yards and a career-low two touchdowns off of 39 receptions. When Slaton was injured against Louisville, Reynaud filled in for him at running back, contributing to Reynaud's 221 yards rushing on 14 carries for the season. He had a career-best 110 yards on five catches with a touchdown against ECU, when the run offense wasn't productive. He was also effective on special teams, when he recorded 813 yards on kick returns and a touchdown. The touchdown came against Maryland, when he bobbled the ball upon catching it. He then picked it up and ran 96 yards for the score, which was the ESPN Play of the Week. He was named to the second-team all-Big East squad at the season's end, along with tackle Ryan Stanchek and punt returner Vaughn Rivers, who were both named to the second-team squad. Reynaud had 1,554 all-purpose yards on the season, which is the sixth most in a season by a Mountaineer in school history. In the 2007 season, Reynaud was the main receiver for quarterback Pat White. Reynaud earned second-team all-Big East honors after the regular season ended and earned the team's Coaches Contribution Award. In the team's 48-28 victory over Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, he recorded five receptions for 42 yards and two touchdowns and also had a 30-yard run for a touchdown. His touchdowns tied him with Chris Henry for most in a single-season in school history and moved him to third all-time in school history while his 64 receptions on the season was fourth most in school history. Reynaud finished his career 12th in the all-time school career receiving yardage list, fifth most receptions and third most receiving touchdowns. ==Professional careerPre-draft=== On January 10, 2008, Reynaud announced he would forgo his senior year (regained due to being a prop player) and enter the 2008 NFL Draft.SI.com Reynaud was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. Reynaud's 34.5 vertical jump was the 11th best by a receiver, while his 3-cone drill time of 6.88 was the 9th best, his 20 bench reps were third, and his broad jump was also third best for a receiver.NFL Events: Combine Top Performers Reynaud reported that he met with the New England Patriots at the NFL Combine.Darius Reynaud, WR, NFL Draft - KFFL At West Virginia's Pro Day, Reynaud ran a 4.48 40-yard dash, with a 37\\" vertical jump.

He was released by the team during final cuts, but re-signed to the team's practice squad. The Vikings then promoted Reynaud to the active roster late in November 2008. Reynaud made his NFL debut during Week 12 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. During the game, he returned two kicks for 36 yards, with a long of 18 yards. He also recorded one tackle. In the Vikings 34-14 victory over the Chicago Bears, he returned two kicks for 62 yards, including a 49-yard return. He also recorded two tackles. Reynaud ended the season with eight kick returns for 201 yards, including a season-long 49-yard return. On September 5, 2009, Reynaud was made part of the 53 man active roster for the Vikings. After the 2009-2010 season, the Vikings converted Reynaud to the Running back position.Reynaud moved to RB As a result, Reynaud has changed his jersey number from 82 to 27. ===New York Giants=== On September 3, 2010, Reynaud was traded with QB Sage Rosenfels to the New York Giants. On September 3, 2011, Reynaud was cut by the Giants. ===Tennessee Titans=== Darius Reynaud was signed on January 7, 2012, to the Tennessee Titans only months after being cut by the Giants. In his first preseason game, Reynaud had a 21-yard run for a touchdown and returned a kick 85-yards for a second touchdown late in the 3rd quarter. Later in week three against the Detroit Lions, Reynaud set a franchise record by returning a 105-yard touchdown on a kickoff in the 4th quarter. During the same game on a punt return, Reynaud threw a lateral pass to cornerback Tommie Campbell which resulted in a touchdown. This play was reminiscent of the infamous \\"Music City Miracle\\" and has been dubbed by some fans \\"Music City Miracle 2\\". On December 30, 2012, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Reynaud became the 16th player in NFL history to return two punts for touchdowns. Reynaud holds the dubious distinction of scoring the fastest in an NFL game, albeit for the opposing team. In Week 1 of the 2013 season against the Steelers, Reynaud caught the opening kickoff in the end zone, momentarily entered the field of play, and hesitatingly re-entered the end-zone as he thought a touch back would be the best return option option. Originally ruled a touch back, head coach Mike Tomlin challenged that, although Reynaud's movements were minimal, the ball clearly exited and re-entered the end zone. The call was overturned and the Steelers were awarded a safety. The official time stamp of the safety is 14:57 in the first quarter. On October 21, 2013, after muffing a punt that resulted in a San Francisco 49ers touchdown and negated a potential Titans comeback in the fourth quarter, Reynaud was released from the team. ===New York Jets=== Reynaud was signed by the New York Jets on December 3, 2013 after return specialist Josh Cribbs was placed on the injured reserve list. ===Chicago Bears=== Reynaud was signed by the Chicago Bears on August 18, 2014.

The -wide caldera was formed by the collapse of this dacite volcano following a catastrophic VEI-6 eruption about 600 years ago, which produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that reached the Pacific Ocean, and spread an airborne deposit of volcanic ash throughout the northern Andes. This last eruption followed a dormancy period of 14,000 years and is known as the 1280 Plinian eruption.Patricia A. Mothes, Minard L. Hall (2008) \\"The plinian fallout associated with Quilotoa's 800 yr BP eruption, Ecuadorian Andes\\", Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, Volume 176, Issue 1, 10 September 2008, Pages 56-69 The fourth (of seven) eruptive phase was phreatomagmatic, indicating that a Crater lake was already present at that time. The caldera has since accumulated a crater lake, which has a greenish color as a result of dissolved minerals. Fumaroles are found on the lake floor and hot springs occur on the eastern flank of the volcano. Quilotoa is a tourist site of growing popularity. The route to the \\"summit\\" (the small town of Quilotoa) is generally traveled by hired truck or bus from the town of Zumbahua 17 km to the South, or more commonly by bus from Latacunga. Visitors no longer have to pay two US dollars each to look from the lip of the caldera. There are a number of simple hostels in the immediate area offering services such as mules and guides. Activities include a four to five-hour hike around the caldera (whose diameter is just over 3 km). The caldera rim is highly irregular and reaches its maximum elevations (3810 m to the N, 3894 m to the NW and 3915 m to the SE) at three lava domes. The 10 km hike is sandy and steep in places and can be quite taxing, particularly if there is fog. It is a half-hour hike down from the viewpoint (and 1- to 2-hour hike back up the 280-meter vertical ascent), and very basic lodging down in its bowl. Camping is permitted at the bottom of the crater, but there is no potable water (except half-litre bottles sold at the hostel)Viva Quilotoa Travel Guide site visit Jan 31, 2009 The lake surface is located at 3,500 m asl. The total volume of water stored in Lake Quilotoa is 0.35 km3. According to local inhabitants, the lake level has been slowly declining over the last 10 years. Travertine deposits occur along the shore up to 10 m above the lake level (in the year 2000). The village of Quilotoa and the associated crater is also a popular destination within the Quilotoa Loop and is a common starting point for the Quilotoa Traverse, a multi-day village to village hiking route. ==See also== * Volcanic crater lake ==References== ==External links == * Travel information * Jan 2009 Updated travel info * Events in Quilotoa Category:Volcanoes of Ecuador Category:Calderas of Ecuador Category:Geography of Cotopaxi Province Category:Andean Volcanic Belt Category:Active volcanoes Category:Volcanic crater lakes Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:VEI-6 volcanoes ","title":"Quilotoa"},{"id":"9102243","text":"Charles Bazire (1624‚Äì1677) was one of the first well documented businessmen of New France.

Configuration information is retrieved at boot time by automatically searching on an attached floppy disk drive, USB flash memory drive, or another server on the local network willing to provide the configuration. == Overview == Sentry Firewall starts from CD-ROM and immediately constructs a RAM disk in the computer's memory. Before the system fully boots, a script searches for removable media containing a file called \\"sentry.conf\\". If that file is found, it may contain detailed instructions and a list of files to be copied from the removable media to the RAM disk before the system is finally allowed to boot. The CD-ROM is pre-loaded with a variety of configurable network tools, including iptables. Because the RAM disk is created each time the machine boots, it is possible to recover from any sort of problem simply by rebooting the machine. From a security perspective, this is compelling because the machine essentially becomes immune to viruses or file corruption - or at least the effects of either problem can't survive a reboot. == Configuration == While basic Linux familiarity is necessary to configure a basic set of files necessary to use the firewall, there exists Windows programs capable of creating the bulk of the configuration scripts based on interaction with a graphical user interface. Firewall Builder is one such example; this program also works with other firewall products unrelated to Sentry Firewall. == Current status == According to the project's maintainer, Sentry Firewall has not been updated since its January 2005 release.sentryfirewall.com news posting 2006-03-18 ==External links== * == References == Category:Firewall software Category:Gateway/routing/firewall distribution Category:Slackware Category:Discontinued Linux distributions ","title":"Sentry Firewall"},{"id":"9102286","text":"Dan Anthony (formerly Dan Jaramillo) is an American recording artist, songwriter and musician.

It has often been considered Shirley's best tragicomedy, and one of his best plays. The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 3 July, 1633. In licensing the play, Herbert took the opportunity to record his \\"delight and satisfaction\\" with it, and held it up as \\"a pattern to other poets...for the bettering of manners and language....\\"Schelling, pp. 316‚Äì17. The play was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and was performed at St. James's Palace on Tuesday, 19 November 1633, in honor of the birthday of King Charles I. (A generation later, his son and eventual successor Charles II would watch a revival of the play on 20 November 1662.) The play's subject was topical in 1633: Charles was considering filling the post of Lord High Admiral of England, which had been vacant since the 1628 assassination of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.Britland, p. 254. The Young Admiral was one of five of Shirley's plays published in 1637. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 13 April 1637, and was issued later that year in a quarto printed by Thomas Cotes for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke. Shirley dedicated the play to George Harding, 8th Baron Berkeley, a prominent literary patron of the day.Berkeley was the dedicatee of Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (1623), and Massinger's The Renegado (1630), among other works. Shirley's source for the plot of his play was Don Lope de Cardona, by Lope de Vega. Shirley tightens the Aristotelian unities of the plot, and simplifies the story by eliminating some of the more fantastic elements of Lope's story ‚Äì Vittori doesn't go mad, Cassandra doesn't dress as a man; she also doesn't apparently die and isn't apparently resurrected.Forsythe, pp. 191‚Äì2. It is a rare case in which Shirley's drama can be praised for restraint. ==Synopsis== The play tells the story of Vittori, admiral to Cesario, prince of Naples. Both Vittori and Cesario are competitors for the hand of Cassandra; on her account Cesario breaks off his intended marriage with Rosinda, princess of Sicily. In response to this insult, the Sicilians attack Naples. Cesario sends Vittori to command his fleet in defense, hoping his admiral will be killed ‚Äì but Vittori is, as his name suggests, victorious. The Admiral, however, finds that the city gates are closed to him on his return, and that his prince is conspiring against him. Vittori flees with his father and Cassandra; but the father, Alphonso, is captured by the Neapolitans, while Vittori and Cassandra are shipwrecked and captured by the Sicilian forces. The King of Sicily, preparing to lay siege Naples, threatens to kill Cassandra if Vittori does not join his forces; and Vittori agrees. Yet he learns that his father will be beheaded if he keeps to his bargain with the King; the choice between the lives of his father and his love is a typical tragicomic dilemma. Cesario, however, is drawn to the Sicilian camp by a letter from Cassandra, and there he too is captured. The Sicilian princess Rosinda counters by surrendering to the Neapolitans, which forces the arrangement of a peace treaty. Vittori and Cassandra marry, as do Cesario and Rosinda. The play's mandatory comic subplot features Rosinda's cowardly servant Pazzorello. ==Notes== ==References== * Britland, Karen. Drama at the Courts of Queen Henietta Maria.

The first two graduating classes, of 1969 and 1970, were temporarily housed at other locations, during the construction of the new high school. It was a grades 9-13, then grades 9-12 high school when the Government of Ontario decided to eliminate grade 13. In 2002 grades 11-12 were transferred to CCVS and grades 7 and 8 remained at GVSS. The school was thereafter known as General Vanier Intermediate School. To coincide with the school's closing, there was a homecoming reunion held on the weekend of July 22, 2011. The TR Leger Alternative School now occupies the building. ==Students== The approximately 500 students, affectionately called the \\"General Vanier Vikings\\", came from a wide array of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.

The fable of Helen of Troy may be the best known classical tale reporting an incidence of surrendering a female member of a ruling line to gain peace or shore up alliances of state between nation- states headed by small oligarchies or acknowledged royalty. == Europe == Duke of Burgundy to Marie Ad√©la√Øde of Savoy on December 7, 1697 by Antoine Dieu While the contemporary Western ideal sees marriage as a unique bond between two people who are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) often see marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served, and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses are considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons was the pattern for centuries among European rulers. Careful selection of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending on the law of the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father. Traditionally, many factors were important in the arranging of royal marriages. One such factor was the size of the tracts of land that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was the stability of the control exerted over that territory: when there is territorial instability in a royal family, other royals will be less inclined to marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and \\"their countries during peace and war\\" and could justify many important political decisions. == Importance of religion == Religion has always been closely tied to political affairs and continues to be today in many countries. Religious considerations were often important in marriages among royal families, particularly in lands where there was an established or official religion. When a royal family was prepared to negotiate or arrange the marriage of one of its children, it was extremely important to have a prospective spouse who followed the same religion or, at the very least, that the spouse be willing to convert before the wedding. In non-Catholic royal families, there were few things worse than marrying a person who was a Catholic. Some countries barred from accession to the throne any person who married a Catholic, as in the British Act of Settlement 1701. When a Protestant prince converted to Catholicism, he risked being disowned by his family, and often being barred from the throne himself. Some of these laws are still in force, centuries after the conclusion of Europe's Wars of Religion. Roman Catholic countries had similar laws and strictures. France, for example, effectively barred non-Catholics from the throne. Even if the law did not strictly prohibit marrying non-Catholic royalty, political situations and popular sentiment were frequently sufficient to dissuade princes from so doing. == Rulers' marriages Elizabeth I=== Contrary to what some historians have said about her elusiveness when in marriage negotiations with suitors or their representatives, Queen Elizabeth I was known to be straightforward in her various courtships. In 1565, when in the midst of the Habsburg matrimonial project, Elizabeth promptly dismissed the rival French suit of their fourteen-year-old king, stating she would have to be ten years younger to consider it. Furthermore, in addition to concerns about religion, financial arrangements, and security, Elizabeth also maintained that she could not marry anyone whom she had not seen in person, perhaps as a result of her father's own displeasure and divorce of Anne of Cleves. The emphasis on religion, national security, and securing the line of succession in all of Elizabeth's marriage negotiations demonstrate the emphasis placed on the political importance of marriages of state during this period. Although some of her contemporaries hoped she would find solace in marriage, procreation was still considered the primary purpose of royal marriage. In March 1565, Elizabeth told her Spanish ambassador, Diego Guzm√°n de Silva: :If I could appoint such a successor to the Crown as would please me and the country, I would not marry, as it is a thing for which I have never had any inclination. My subjects, however press me so that I cannot help myself or take the other course, which is a very difficult one. There is a strong idea in the world that a woman cannot live unless she is married, or at all events that is she refrains from marriage she does so for some bad reason....But what can we do? Thus, Elizabeth appeared to personally believe that a woman should reasonably be able to remain single. However, she continued to engage in marriage negotiations for decades because of the expectations of her role as monarch. Although she herself had little inclination to marry, she understood the limitations of her power and therefore seriously considered marriage on numerous occasion at the behest of councillors. The Habsburg marriage negotiations revolving around the marriage of Queen Elizabeth I to Archduke Charles show the way marriage was often negotiated in royal families. The first phase began in 1559, with the initiative for a matrimonial alliance between England and Austria. However, the first phase was a failure and, the people of England were relieved to the extent that they feared a foreign ruler coming into their country. Negotiations were re-opened with some difficulty in 1563 by the English. This was in part due to Charles' search for a wife elsewhere, the lack of permanent diplomatic links between Austria and England, and because of Emperor Ferdinand's distrust of Elizabeth for her refusal of his son's suit in 1559. However, Sir William Cecil was interested in the match and began work on a marriage negotiation. While the first set of negotiations were uncertain, the second round of negotiations gathered stronger support in England for the suit and went on for several years. Both sides hoped to gain from a marital alliance. In England, the negotiations were a key element to Elizabeth's foreign policy and intended to protect the country's commercial interests and political security against the French-Scottish alliance. Austria also hoped to gain in similar ways from a political alliance and possibly bring Catholicism back to England. However, English support was partly due to the fact that the English had been deliberately misled to believe that Charles would be willing to convert to Protestantism and in the end, the archduke's Catholicism and refusal to come to England before finalizing a betrothal proved too difficult to overcome and the suit dissolved. These negotiations, nevertheless, illustrate how support and opposition ebbed and flowed over the course of time, and how issues like religion, which seemed to be resolvable at the outset, could ultimately doom an otherwise promising proposal. ===Napoleon=== Napoleon, as emperor, gave out kingdoms and female relatives with equal largesse to favored Marshals and general officers. ===United Kingdom=== Through most of recorded history state marriages were also common at lesser levels of nobility, and many a lesser marriage of state was consummated and bargained over during all of the Middle Ages and through the middle of the twentieth-century in western society, and the old forms still hold sway in many other cultural contexts today. One famous example of a marriage of state for lesser reasons was that of George II of Great Britain's parents. The Princess Sophia's dowry included properties assuring an income of 100,000 thalers annually, which led to George Louis, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg (the future George I of Great Britain), marrying his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle--when both were pressed into the arrangement by his mother-- and that German ducal dynastic move accidentally gave the couple the inside track on the Protestant thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland (and later, those of the United Kingdom and Ireland). ==See also== * Arranged marriage * Heqin ‚Äì a similar practice in Ancient China * Royal intermarriage ==References== Category:Marriage Category:Monarchy ","title":"Marriage of state"},{"id":"9102698","text":"\\"Partytime!\\" is a special promotional CD release by pop singer Gloria Estefan.

Rashi calls it a \\"Mishnah\\". It contains 14 sections describing various aspects of the Tabernacle: the boards (1), woolen carpets (2), and carpets made of goat-hair (3), the curtain (4), the courtyard (5), the Ark of the Covenant (6-7), the table (8), the menorah (9-10), the incense altar (1), the goblets (12), the Levitical services (13), and the wandering in the wilderness (14). In the Munich manuscript, sections 1 and 2 constitute one section. == Origins of the Baraita == The authorities mentioned in this baraita are: Judah ha-Nasi I, R. Jose, R. Nehemiah, R. Judah, Jose b. Judah, Judah b. La·∏≥ish, R. Eliezer, Abba Saul, R. Meir, Joshua ben Karha, Isi (= Isai) b. Judah, R. Nathan, Simon b. Yo·∏•ai, and a student of R. Ishmael not otherwise designated. Except for Isi ben Judah and Judah ben Lakish, every authority mentioned also appears in the Mishnah; and these two are as old as Rebbi, the author of the Mishnah. From this fact, and from the fact that many teachings of the Baraita on the Erection of the Tabernacle are cited in the Talmud with the formula \\"de-tania\\" or \\"tanu rabbanan\\",See proofs in Flesch, p. 7 it may be assumed that this baraita was available to the amoraim in a fixed form. It is questionable, however, whether the Mekhilta and Sifre drew upon this baraita. Mekhilta Beshalla·∏•, introduction30b, ed. I.H. Weiss seems to have preserved the aggadah on the seven clouds in the wilderness in an older form than that given by section 14 of the present baraita, though this very section may not pertain to the real baraita. It is also possible that Sifre Numbers 59, originated from section 10 of the Baraita. Lewy inclines to the idea that the baraita was originally part of the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon. But an argument against such a hypothesis is the fundamental difference in the two writings; the baraita containing almost no Midrash, while the Mekhilta is composed chiefly of halakhic Midrash. The same reason may serve to refute Br√ºll's viewJahrb√ºcher, v. 134 et seq., and Central-Anzeiger f√ºr J√ºdische Literatur, p. 32 according to which the baraita is an addition to the Mekhilta. == Elements of the Baraita == The text of the baraita is in general free from interpolations (the words of Isi ben Akkabyah in section 10 do not occur in the Munich manuscript; they found their way later into the baraita from Menachot 29a). Nevertheless, sections 13-14 seem to be later additions from another baraita (they occur already in Rashi), as shown by their aggadic character, and by the fact that the author of VeHizhir (who copied the baraita in full) omitted them‚Äîprobably because he did not know of them. There is much in favor of the view of Gr√ºnhut, and before him of ·∏§ayyim M. Horowitz,In Tosefta 'Atti·∏≥ata, 1:7 that both sections were constituents of the Baraita of the Forty-nine Rules. It is especially noteworthy that the numbers \\"four\\" and \\"seven\\" are the ones on which the sections hinge. ==References Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === *Abraham b.

The ride is also the site of Harmon Killebrew's 520-foot home run record at the former Metropolitan Stadium and is marked by one of the stadium's original chairs located on the wall above the ride. ==Summary== After going through a queue winding through a mine within the attraction's mountain, guests board their logs and make their way through Paul's logging camp, with one of his axes being set near a bend in the river while singing can be heard throughout. As guests enter the kitchen, riders see workers preparing Paul's breakfast of giant pancakes, with an enormous bottle of Knott's Berry Farm brand Boysenberry Syrup on the table left over from the park's Camp Snoopy days. Going outside, the flume passes another of Paul's axes and various critters such as beavers and skunks before going inside again to pass a bear cub in a tree and more lumberjacks. After this is the attraction's first drop, which leads guests into a cave to see Paul Bunyan and Babe pulling down trees. Paul warns the riders of the saw mill ahead as we go up a lift hill. The saw operator quickly notices the riders and turns off the saw and hopes to see guests again before guests go down the second drop, which is home to the attraction's on-ride photo camera. Panoramic photo of the splashdown and loading areas. The \\"Red Chair\\" marking Harmon Killebrew's home run record is visible in the background (and a plaque in the foreground). ==Accidents== On August 20, 1992, the ride was shut down for five hours due to a faulty gear. Maintenance workers noticed that the gear that ran the conveyor belt had started to strip. Park officials stated the fault never posed a safety risk. On Saturday, August 1, 1998, a 12-year-old boy fell off the log chute. As his boat neared the top of the final chute, the boy began to panic and stood up to reach a railing. The ride was stopped, but the boat began to fall. Losing his grip, he fell off the chute, falling onto the landscaping rocks, and later died from the injuries he sustained. O.D. Hopkins Associates, Inc., the manufacturer of the ride, inspected it and found that the ride was in proper working order, and that restraints would not have prevented the incident, while a safety consultant disagreed with the latter statement. It was the park's (then Camp Snoopy)'s first major accident. On November 4, 2007, a conveyor belt malfunctioned, causing one log-themed boat to crash into another. There were only minor injuries. The ride was inspected and fixed. The ride re-opened on November 15, 2007. == References == Category:Nickelodeon Universe Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1992 Category:Paul Bunyan ","title":"Log Chute"},{"id":"9102820","text":"Puzur-Ashur III was the king of Assyria from 1503 BC to 1479 BC.

In dim room light, the examiner notes the size of the pupils. The patient is asked to gaze into the distance, and the examiner swings the beam of a penlight back and forth from one pupil to the other, and observes the size of pupils and reaction in the eye that is lit. ==Interpretation== * Normally, each illuminated pupil promptly becomes constricted. The opposite pupil also constricts consensually. * When ocular disease, such as cataract, impairs vision, the pupils respond normally. * When the optic nerve is damaged, the sensory (afferent) stimulus sent to the midbrain is reduced. The pupil, responding less vigorously, dilates from its prior constricted state when the light is moved away from the unaffected eye and towards the affected eye.

The expeditions can last from as little as a few hours to several days. For longer trips the llamas often carry up to three days trekking supplies or cargo in purpose-built pack saddles so the people with them can carry as little as a day backpack.Louise Southerden, \\"Kaikoura's natural wonders delight on land and sea\\", San Francisco Chronicle, page M4, March 27, 2011. Llamas have padded feet similar to a dog, which lets them easily traverse steep and rocky paths while being more environmentally friendly to the ground than horse hooves. They also can use narrower paths reducing disturbances to vegetation. Llamas have both a thick undercoat and a wooly topcoat which protects them from the cold. A three-compartment stomach helps them cope with poor quality food sources. A llama can carry about 25% of its body weight with no problem. So an average animal of 300 pounds (136 kg) can carry around 75 pounds (34 kg) of equipment in its packs. Llamas' excellent endurance combined with biddable and peaceful natures makes them suitable pack animals for hill walking, including for people not used to dealing with more stubborn animals such as mules. Llamas hiking can appeal to people that might not usually participate in endurance walking, such as couples looking for an unusual way to enjoy some romantic time together, or walking parties that include disabled children. ==History== Llamas have been used by people of the Andes mountains as pack animals for hundreds of years.Camels and llamas at work By Julia Barnes, page 24. Recently, llama hiking has become popular in countries outside of South America. Since the second half of the 20th century large numbers of llamas have been brought across to the US and Canada. In southern California a few avocado farmers have used llamas to carry large loads of the fruit down steeper hills. In the UK, llamas can act as companions for a relaxing stroll, like walking a dog. Back in 1997, British newspaper The Independent described llama hiking as an exotic import from California, but it has since become more commonplace. In Wales during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic , Llama's previously used for Llama hiking have been used to help deliver food and help cheer up lonely people unable to get out due to the lockdown. ==Therapeutic value== Llamas are suitable for close contact with children due to their docile and friendly natures. Parents have reported children being willing to walk twice as far when accompanied by llamas. Llama trekking is a popular therapeutic activity for disabled children. Autistic children can respond especially well to llamas, sometimes the expressive eyes of the animal help them make their first sustained eye contact. According to author Kay Frydenborg, the good results llamas have with children may in part be due to how pleasant they are to touch. ==References== ==External links== *Llama Backpacking Documentary produced by Oregon Field Guide Category:Hiking ","title":"Llama hiking"},{"id":"9102862","text":"The Samborides () or House of Sobies≈Çaw () were a ruling dynasty in the historic region of Pomerelia. They were first documented about 1155 as governors (princeps) in the Eastern Pomeranian lands serving the royal Piast dynasty of Poland, and from 1227 ruled as autonomous princes until 1294, at which time the dynasty died out. The subsequent war for succession between the Polish Piast dynasty, the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg and the State of the Teutonic Order resulted in the Teutonic takeover of Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) in 1308. ==Geography== The dynasty's dominion, Pomerelia, roughly corresponded with the area of today's Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland. The Samborides from 1227 used the Medieval Latin title dux Pomeraniae; their Duchy of Pomerelia was therefore referred to as \\"Duchy of Pomerania\\", even though there was another Duchy of Pomerania to the west, ruled by the House of Griffins, who likewise bore the title \\"Dukes of Pomerania\\". In Polish usage, the term Pomorze (Pomerania) tends to be associated with the entire strip of land on the Baltic coast between the Vistula river in the east and the Raksa (Recknitz) river in the west. Until the Germanic invasions, the term was used as far west as the Morini). The distinction is achieved by the use of Pomorze Gda≈Ñskie (i.e., Pomerania-Danzig) for Pomerelia, and Pomorze Szczeci≈Ñskie (i.e., Pomerania-Stettin) for the former Griffin duchy, to whom the title \\"Duke of Pomerania\\" and the term \\"Duchy of Pomerania\\" would be used exclusively after the Samborides' extinction. During the rule of Duke Swiƒôtope≈Çk II, Samboride holdings spread from S≈Çupsk in the west going east across the Vistula River including ≈ªu≈Çawy Gda≈Ñskie, and in the south bordered the Polish dukedoms of Greater Poland and Kuyavia, the Noteƒá river being the border. ==Origins== The Polish name \\"House of Sobies≈Çaw\\" derives from Duke Sobies≈Çaw I, steward for the Piast dukes of Greater Poland in Pomerelia, while \\"Samborides\\" as used in English and German derives from his probable son and successor, Duke Sambor I. According to traditional historiography the first certain princeps of Pomerelia was Sambor, as the records concerning Sobies≈Çaw I stems from the 15th century Oliwa chronicle of the 15th century seemed not reliable. Polish historians however do not share this reservation and have been using his father as the name for the dynasty. During the conquest of the Pomeranian lands between 1113 and 1121, the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth about 1116 had installed governors ruling in the Pomerelian lands, probably the ancestors of Sobies≈Çaw I. An affiliation with the Pomeranian dukes Siemosi≈Ç and ≈öwiƒôtobor or a relation with the Polish Piast dynasty has never been conclusively established. The most important duke was Swiƒôtope≈Çk II who in Kashubian traditional history carries the nickname \\"the Great\\". Swiƒôtope≈Çk received Pomerelia as vassaldom from his suzerain, the Polish High Duke Leszek I the White of the Piast dynasty in 1216 or 1217. Perhaps acting in concert with the Piast prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic of Greater Poland he benefited from his ally action when they had High Duke Leszek I and Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia kidnapped and then Leszek murdered during the GƒÖsawa Piast assembly in 1227. As a result, Swiƒôtope≈Çk declared himself an independent ruler and dux of Pomerania. Swiƒôtope≈Çk II was the greatest military commander of the dynasty, having defeated various armies of Piast, Prussian, Danish, German and Griffite invaders during his long reign. He was the first Polish (Slavic) ruler who actively was challenged and fought military campaigns against the Teutonic Order and many times aided the pagan Prussians against the Order and Piast princes carrying crusading campaigns against them. His brothers Sambor II and Ratibor ceded some of their holdings to the Teutonic Knights allowing the Order State to get a first important foothold on the right bank of the Vistula River. Swiƒôtope≈Çk's son and last Samboride ruler M√©stwin II fought various traditional enemies, including the Teutonic Order. As a matter of necessity when fighting for his throne, he pledged feudal homage from a couple of towns to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg by signing the Treaty of Choszczno in 1269. In 1282 he concluded an inheritance agreement at Kƒôpno with Duke Przemys≈Ç II of Greater Poland, King of Poland from 1295, who upon his death incorporated Pomerelia into the Lands of the Polish Crown. ==Samborides ancestry== #Sobies≈Çaw I (Subislaw I), princeps of Pomerelia about 1155‚Äì1177/79 ##Sambor I, princeps of Pomerelia 1177/79‚Äì1205 ###Sobies≈Çaw II (Subislaw II), died about 1217/23, under tutelage ###unidentified son, died young ##M√©stwin I the Peaceful, princeps of Pomerelia 1205‚Äì1220 ###Miros≈Çawa, ‚àû Bogislaw II, Duke of Pomerania ###Swiƒôtope≈Çk II the Great, princeps of Pomerelia from 1220, Duke of Pomerelia at Gda≈Ñsk 1227-1266 ####Euphemia, ‚àû Jaromar II, Prince of Rugia ####M√©stwin II, Duke of Pomerelia at ≈öwiecie from 1255, last Duke of Pomerelia 1270‚Äì1294, ‚àû Jutta, daughter of Count Dietrich I of Brehna and Wettin #####Katharina, ‚àû Duke Pribislaw II of Mecklenburg-Parchim, Lord of Bia≈Çogard #####Euphemia, ‚àû Count Adolph V of Holstein-Segeberg ####John, died 1248 ####unidentified daughter, ‚àû unidentified Count of Kevenberg ####Wratis≈Çaw II, Duke of Pomerelia at Gda≈Ñsk 1266-1270 ###Jadwiga (Hedwig), ‚àû Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic of Greater Poland ### Witos≈Çawa, prioress of ≈ªukowo Abbey ###Wratis≈Çaw I, Duke of Pomerelia at ≈öwiecie 1227-1233 ###Sambor II, Duke of Pomerelia at Lubiszewo (Liebschau) 1233‚Äì1269, ‚àû Mechthild, daughter of Prince Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg ####Sobies≈Çaw III (Subislaw III), died 1254 ####Margaret Sambiria, ‚àû King Christopher I of Denmark ####Gertrude, unmarried ####Euphemia ‚àû Duke Boles≈Çaw II the Bald of Silesia ####Salome ‚àû Prince Ziemomys≈Ç of Kuyavia ####Jolanta (Jolanthe) ###Ratibor, Duke of Pomerelia at Bia≈Çogarda 1233-1262 ==See also== * List of Pomeranian duchies and dukes * House of Griffins * Gryfici (≈öwiebodzice) * Gryf coat of arms * Polabian Slavs * Polabian language ==Bibliography== * Rymar E., Rodow√≥d ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt pomorskich, t. 1, Szczecin 1995; Supplement, Gda≈Ñsk 2003; ≈öliwi≈Ñski B., Poczet ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt gda≈Ñskich, Gda≈Ñsk 1997 Category:Polish royal houses Category:Dukes of Pomerania Category:Polish nobility ","title":"Samborides"},{"id":"9102883","text":"A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅrƒÅri I, inscribed ma≈°-≈°ur-ERIM.GABA, \\"A≈°≈°ur is my help,\\" was an Old Assyrian king who ruled for 26 years during the mid-second millennium BC, speculatively ca. 1534‚Äì1509 (Landsberger) or 1523‚Äì1499 BC (Gasche).

According to Professor Seyyed Ali Al-e Davud: The picture one gets from the 7th and 8th century Islamic era from the Safina Tabriz is a complete picture of the cultural, scientific and social settings of that time. One of many aspects of this manuscript deals with Islamic philosophy. In his recent book Nasr. S.H, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: philosophy in the land of prophecy, Published 2006SUNY Press Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr has described the manuscript as an earth shaking discovery. Dr. Nasr provides a brief overview of the philosophical treatise of the Safina. A Page from the Safina containing a modern Persian and a Fahlavi (regional Iranian dialect poem) == Overview of some of the articles == The compendium constitutes about 209 eclectic articles spanning numerous subjects and topics. All the articles are written in Persian and Arabic although Fahlaviyyat poetry and sayings are seen in some of the articles. Article 114, in Persian, is about the history of Tabriz. It mentions the building of Tabriz in the hands of Wahsudan, the Rawadid ruler. Article 134 contains the dictionary Lughat-i Fors (lexicon of the Persian language) of Asadi Tusi. The Persian articles 138 and 139 deal with the moral and philosophical topics presented by the Sassanid Vizir Bozorgmehr. Articles 77, 79 and 80 are in Arabic and from Avicenna. They touch upon the question of destiny vs free will among other philosophical topics. The questioner is the famous Persian poet Abusa'id Abolkhayr.

Also here: ==Debates of inanimate objects== Interesting debates between various objects constitute some of the articles of the Safina. In each of these debates, each object boasts of its own quality relative to its opponent while attempting to belittle their opponents. Through these abstractions of inanimate objects, the authors use both poetry and composition to convey moral and philosophical lessons. The following listed articles all in Persian are the debates between the inanimate objects.

His grand father Munshi Kudartullah was advocate in Varanasi. His father was a poet of all- India repute who wrote poems in Urdu and probably it must have been from him that Justice Hidayatullah got his love for language and literature. Wilayatullah was Gold medallist of Aligarh Muslim University in 1897 besting famous mathematician Sir Ziauddin Ahmad, a favourite of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. He served till 1928 in ICS and from 1929 to 1933 as member of Central Legislative Assembly.

When he graduated in 1926, he was awarded the Malak Gold Medal. Following the trend of Indians studying British law abroad, Hidayatullah attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge from 1927 to 1930 and obtained B.A. and M.A. Degrees from there. Here he secured the 2nd order of merit and was awarded a Gold Medal for his performance in 1930. He was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn when he was just 25 years old. He was awarded LL.D. (Honoris Causa) from University of the Philippines and D. Litt. (Honoris Causa) from University of Bhopal (now Barkatullah University) and University of Kakatiya. While at Cambridge, Hidayatullah was elected and served as the President of the Indian Majlis in 1929. Also while here, he pursued English and Law Tripos from the renowned Lincoln's Inn. In addition he secured a place of Barrister-at-Law in 1930. ==Career== After graduation, Hidayatullah returned to India and enrolled as an advocate of the High Court of Central Provinces and Berar at Nagpur on 19 July 1930. He also taught Jurisprudence and Mahomedan Law in the University College of Law at Nagpur and was also the Extension Lecturer in English literature. On 12 December 1942, he was appointed GovernmentPleader in the High Court at Nagpur. On 2 August 1943, he became the Advocate General of Central Provinces and Berar (now Madhya Pradesh) and continued to hold the said post till he was appointed as an Additional Judge of that High Court in 1946.

In August 1979, the band also supported Led Zeppelin at the Knebworth Festival 1979. The group was formed and led by Rolling Stones and Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood, primarily to promote his latest LP Gimme Some Neck. The line-up included Rolling Stones member Keith Richards, bassist Stanley Clarke, former Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, Rolling Stones confederate and saxophonist Bobby Keys and drummer Joseph Zigaboo Modeliste of The Meters. For the Knebworth show Clarke was replaced on short notice by bassist Phil Chen, who had to learn all the songs in one day. The band played a mix of classic rock & roll, R&B;, blues and country music, along with Ron Wood solo material and Jagger/Richards songs. Wood sang lead on most numbers (with Richards, McLagan and Clarke providing back-up vocals), as well as playing guitar, pedal steel, harmonica and saxophone. The New Barbarians debuted as the Rolling Stones' support act at two charity concerts to benefit the CNIB at the Oshawa Civic Auditorium near Toronto, Ontario on 22 April 1979, fulfilling one of the conditions of Richards' 1978 sentence for possession of heroin. The band's eighteen-gig US tour followed.

When Abramowitz died of a heart attack in 1958, Stegun took over management of the project and finished the work by 1964, working under the direction of the NBS Chief of Numerical Analysis Philip J. Davis, who was also a contributor to the book. Stegun was born in Yonkers, New York. She began her mathematical career during the Second World War. After teaching mathematics at a Catholic school in New York, she joined the Planning Committee of the Mathematical Tables Project of the WPA. In that role, she learned the basics of numerical analysis from the committee's chair, Gertrude Blanch. While working at the Mathematics Tables Project, she completed a master's degree in mathematics at Columbia University. In 1948, Stegun and a handful of other members of the Mathematical Tables Project moved to Washington, DC, where they set up the Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards, now NIST. She eventually rose to assistant chief of the Computation Laboratory at NBS. In 1965, Stegun was awarded a Gold Medal from the Department of Commerce for her efforts in completing the project. She held the position of assistant chief of the Computing Lab until she became the interim director in 1965. == See also == * Timeline of women in science ==References== Category:People from Yonkers, New York Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:Numerical analysts Category:1919 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Department of Commerce Gold Medal Category:20th- century American women scientists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:Mathematicians from New York (state) ","title":"Irene Stegun"},{"id":"9103091","text":"Once and Future King Part I is the fourth studio album released by Gary Hughes. == Track listing == All songs written by Gary Hughes. # \\"Excalibur\\" ‚Äì 6:22 # \\"Dragon Island Cathedral\\" ‚Äì 6:03 # \\"At the End of Day\\" ‚Äì 4:30 # \\"The Reason Why\\" ‚Äì 4:36 # \\"Shapeshifter\\" ‚Äì 4:45 # \\"King for a Day\\" ‚Äì 4:47 # \\"Avalon\\" ‚Äì 4:00 # \\"Sinner\\" ‚Äì 5:01 # \\"In Flames\\" ‚Äì 5:03 # \\"Lies\\" ‚Äì 5:31 == Personnel  Singers-The Cast === *Damian Wilson ‚Äì (Track 1) *Gary Hughes ‚Äì King Arthur (Tracks 2, 3 and 10) *Lana Lane ‚Äì Queen Guinevere (Track 3) *Danny Vaughn ‚Äì Lancelot (Tracks 4 and 7) *Irene Jansen ‚Äì Morgana (Track 5) *Bob Catley ‚Äì Merlin (Tracks 6 and 9) *Sean Harris ‚Äì Sir Galahad (Track 8) === Musicians-The Players === *Gary Hughes ‚Äì guitar, piano, keyboards, backing vocals and programming *Chris Francis ‚Äì guitars *John Halliwell ‚Äì guitars *Steve McKenna ‚Äì Bass guitars *Greg Morgan ‚Äì drums and percussion *Arjen Lucassen ‚Äì keyboards (Track 1) *Paul Hodson ‚Äì piano and keyboards (Track 6) *Graham Woodcock ‚Äì keyboards (Track 8) *Jason Thanos ‚Äì backing vocals *Damian Wilson ‚Äì backing vocals == Production == *Mixing ‚Äì Pete Coleman *Engineer ‚Äì Gary Hughes *Additional Engineering ‚Äì Pete Coleman, Audu Obaje, Arjen Lucassen, Erik Norlander, Billy Churchill and Jason Thanos == External links == *Heavy Harmonies page Category:2003 albums Category:Arthurian music Category:Music based on works Category:Gary Hughes albums Category:Albums produced by Gary Hughes Category:Frontiers Records albums ","title":"Once and Future King Part I"},{"id":"9103092","text":"Robert Thomas Edlin (May 6, 1922 ‚Äì April 1, 2005) was a highly decorated United States Army Ranger officer during World War II. In 2005, he was awarded the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor posthumously by the Texas Legislature. Texas House Concurrent Resolution No 112 conferring the honor was adopted by both the House and Senate and approved by Governor Rick Perry in March 2005. ==Military serviceWorld War II=== On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Lieutenant Edlin, a rifle company platoon leader in Company A, 2nd Ranger Battalion, led his platoon onto Omaha Beach, receiving debilitating wounds in both legs; evacuated to England the following day, he rejoined his platoon in France on July 15, 1944. During the late summer of 1944, the 2nd Ranger Battalion was assigned to support the American advance in Brittany; on September 9, preceding a dawn attack on the Graf Spee, or Lochrist, battery near the French town of Le Conquet. This was a coastal artillery battery with four 280mm guns, three of which could be traversed towards the American forces surrounding Brest. Their 28 km range made them very dangerous. The German garrison had been subjected to intense fire the previous days but to get them to surrender was still a very hazardous task. Lieutenant Edlin decided to lead a four-man reconnaissance patrol to spot enemy pillboxes and snipers and chart a way through the minefield surrounding the garrison, the capture of which was critical in the effort to retake the port city. The patrol navigated a large minefield and encountered a German pillbox, where Lieutenant Edlin captured the officer in charge; Lieutenant Edlin then forced the officer to escort him and his interpreter to the commanding officer of the Graf Spee battery. On entering the commander's office, Lieutenant Edlin took a grenade, pulled the pin, and held the grenade to the commander's stomach, forcing him to surrender the fort, along with four 280-mm guns, supporting small-arms positions, pillboxes, and approximately 800 enemy soldiers. Edlin joined the Indiana National Guard's 38th Infantry Division at New Albany, Indiana at seventeen years of age. He was mobilized with the 38th Infantry Division to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where he opted to become an officer. After his officer's training, he was transferred to the 28th Infantry Division (Pennsylvania National Guard). After several unsuccessful attempts to gain transfer from the 28th, he volunteered for the http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/rtb/rhof/ Rangers to secure his transfer. After World War II he returned to the Indiana National Guard, however he left the Guard because of their reluctance to integrate African American soldiers into units. He later moved to Corpus Christi Texas, where he retired from law enforcement and opened Edlin's Auction House. (This information can be found in the book \\"The Fool Lieutenant\\" by Marcia Moen, cited below.) Medal of Honor (Distinguished Service Cross) Edlin was recommended by Lieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder (\\"Rudder's Rangers\\"), commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, for the Medal of Honor. Lt. Edlin refused to accept the medal in order to remain with his platoon; he avoided the Medal of Honor recipient requirement of being reassigned to a unit within the continental United States. Lt. Edlin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism. ==Ranger Hall of Fame== In 1995, Edlin was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame. ==Texas Legislative Medal of Honor== Edlin was awarded the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor posthumously in May 2005, just after his death on April 1.Caller.com Family accepts captains honor ==Book== The book, \\"The Fool Lieutenant: A Personal Account of D-Day and WWII\\", about his war-time experiences, was published in 2002. ==External links== *House Concurrent Resolution No. 112 *Rudder's Ranger Turned Author, Aggie Daily, April 4, 2002 ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor Category:United States Army Rangers ","title":"Robert Thomas Edlin"},{"id":"9103131","text":"Estadio Libertador General San Mart√≠n is the football (soccer) venue of the Atl√©tico Club San Mart√≠n of the Mendoza Province in Argentina.

LST stands for Landing Ship, Tank. ==Building and Commissioning== USS LST 494s keel was laid down on 10 August 1943 at Evansville, Indiana by Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co.. She was launched on 11 October 1943 and was commissioned on 18 December 1943. Command of the 494 was turned over to Lt. Irving C. Noyes of Colebrook, New Hampshire. LSTs were long, wide with a displacement weight of 1,653 tons (4,080 tons fully loaded). They were powered from a Main Engine Room by two General Motors V-12 engines (known as GM 567s) which were railroad engines adapted to marine use. Their maximum speed was approximately . Additional engines in the Auxiliary Engine Room provided the ships with electricity. LST 494 was armed with a 3 inch/50 cal. gun on her stern (later replaced with a twin 40 mm gun) and multiple 40 mm and 20 mm anti-aircraft guns. In the European Theater LST 494 carried 6 LCVPs (Landing Craft Vehicle, Personnel), also known as ‚ÄúHiggins Boats‚Äù, each of which was armed with two .30-cal. machine guns. Invasion bound LSTs were manned by a crew of approximately 150. LST 494 was first assigned to the European Theater of War. On 10 March 1944, she began her journey across the North Atlantic for England along with 71 other ships in Convoy SC 155. While crossing the Atlantic, LST 494 carried on her main deck LCT (Landing Craft Tank) 776. File:USS LST-494 in North Africa.jpgUSS LST 494-North Africa 1944 File:USS LST-494 in Okinawa.jpgUSS LST 494 on Omaha Beach, Normandy Invasion, June 1944 == Normandy Campaign == The 494 departed Plymouth, England on 5 June 1944 under the command of Commander Irving \\"Chet\\" Noyes and became part of the largest amphibious force in the history of warfare. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, she made the initial assault on Omaha Beach during the invasion of Normandy. The 494 landed 378 men of the U.S. Army\`s 26th Infantry Regiment (known as the \\"Blue Spaders\\" from their distinctive spad-shaped regimental emblem). The 26th Regiment was part of the 1st Infantry Division. Troops aboard the ship were under the command of Major James B. Carvey. Anti-aircraft fire from the 494 helped down a German Messerschmitt over the invasion beachhead. On 6 June LST 494 aided the USS LCT 2037 that had been hit on her starboard side by enemy fire or a mine and was in danger of sinking. On 7 July, V-1 ‚Äúbuzz bombs‚Äù passed over LST 494 for many hours. One passed over LST 494. LST 494 sailors saw American fighter planes shoot down a number of these aerial bombs. On 10 July LST 494 aided 17 officers and 320 men from the Polish cruiser Dragon. The Dragon had been torpedoed off the coast of Caen, France by a one-man German mini-submarine on 8 July and had to be scuttled. LST 494 continued to support the invasion forces through mid-July 1944, by bringing in reinforcements and by operating as a hospital ship carrying wounded servicemen back to England. During the Normandy campaign, LST 494 transported and landed a total of 1,420 American and Canadian soldiers along with 577 tanks, trucks and other vehicles. ==Southern France Campaign== The 494 was then ordered to travel through the Straits of Gibraltar for service in the Mediterranean and North Africa. On 12 August 1944, the 494 departed Naples, Italy and joined an allied fleet for the invasion of Southern France. The 494 landed troops from the U.S. Army\`s 45th Infantry Division (\\"Thunderbird\\") on French soil on 15 August 1944. Several large German shells hit close to the 494 during the invasion, but fortunately missed their mark. During the Southern France campaign, LST 494 carried a total of 3,318 soldiers along with 717 tanks, trucks and other vehicles. Allied soldiers carried were American, Free French and French Moroccan Goums ‚ÄúGourmiers‚Äù and ‚ÄúSenegalese fighters.‚Äù Lt. Commander Irving Chester Noyes was a decorated naval officer who saw combat in both the Pacific and European Theaters of War. All of his crew lived to fight another day.

She was re-fitted in order to serve as a supply ship for small mine craft. She was then assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater of War. Command of the ship was turned over to Lt. Frank Van Deren Coke. After traversing the Panama Canal, the 494 left Seattle, Washington on 15 April 1945 for Pearl Harbor, Entiwetok and Guam. The next leg of her journey was to Tinian and Saipan. In June 1945, she participated in the latter stages of the fierce, kamikaze plagued assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto. The 494 performed occupation duty in the Far East and saw China service immediately after the war. ==Decommissioning== Upon her return to the United States, she was decommissioned on 29 June 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 28 August of that same year. On 12 August 1948, the 494 was sold to Bosey, Philippines and scrapped. Image:M9s18513.jpg ==Campaign Medals and Battle Ribbons== The LST 494 was awarded the following campaign medals and battle ribbons for her service to her country in two theaters of war: American Campaign Medal and Ribbon; European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and Ribbon with 2 Battle Stars for the Invasions of Normandy and Southern France; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and Ribbon with 1 Battle Star for the assault and occupation of Okinawa-Gunto; Combat Action Ribbon; World War II Victory Medal and Ribbon; Navy Occupation Medal and Ribbon with Asia Clasp; China Service Medal and Ribbon. In 2004, LST 494 and her crew were awarded the Normandie Medal by the French government for their valiant service during the liberation of France in 1944. ==Final Thoughts From The Men Who Served On Her== \\"LST 494 certainly packed a lot of experiences into her relatively short 30 month life in the service of her country. She served faithfully in two theaters of war and sailed over 40,000 miles while crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Irish, Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian and East China Seas. To the men who manned her she was known as the ‚Äúlucky ship.‚Äù During 3 campaigns she survived German artillery rounds fired at her, German bombs dropped on her, flying buzz-bombs, floating mines, kamikazes at Okinawa, a ferocious storm in the Mediterranean, one of the most powerful typhoons in Pacific history, the freezing temperatures and ice of the North Atlantic as well as the hellish heat of the Pacific. LST 494 was decommissioned on June 29, 1946. She was sold to Bosey, Philippines in 1948 and was thought to have been scrapped. At wars end, all of the 200 or so men who served on her survived and returned home to begin their lives again. God indeed smiled on the 494. The men who served on her, their families and friends are forever grateful to God for the blessings He bestowed upon LST 494 and her crew.\\" ==External links== *http://lst494.freeyellow.com/ *http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/16/160494.htm *http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l18/lst-494.htm Category:LST-491-class tank landing ships Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:1943 ships Category:Ships built in Evansville, Indiana ","title":"USS LST-494"},{"id":"9103177","text":"Petit-Saguenay is a municipality in the Canadian province of Quebec, located in Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality.

He is the territory's 23rd governor overall. Luis assumed the governorship on January 2, 1978, succeeding Governor Cyril King, who died in office. He held the governor's office from 1978 until 1987, becoming the longest-serving governor in the history of the U.S. Virgin Islands. ==BiographyEarly years=== Luis was born in 1940 on the neighboring island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. He moved with his family to Saint Croix‚Äîwhich has a sizeable Puerto Rican community‚Äîin the U.S. Virgin Islands when he was two months old. In 1958, Luis graduated from the former Christiansted High School as his class' valedictorian. Luis studied at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. He moved back to Saint Croix after college, where he took a position as a sixth-grade teacher at the Christiansted Public Grammar School. He also worked as a project office manager for the Department of Housing and Urban Development before serving as a in the U.S. Army. Luis was honorable discharged from the United States Army in 1968, holding the rank of sergeant. He returned to St. Croix after his discharge, where he married his wife, the former Luz Maria Guadalupe. He took a series of positions within the civil service and private sector until his election to office in 1972. In 1968, Luis became a personnel administrative officer in the Virgin Islands Department of Health. Luis held several positions in the private sector from 1970 to 1972. He worked for Litwin Corporation as an industrial relations manager. Luis then joined Burns International as an accountant. Finally, Luis was employed as a personnel manager and comptroller at the Estate Carlton Hotel. Luis and his wife, former U.S. Virgin Islands First Lady Luz Maria Luis, had two children, Juan Francisco Luis Jr. and Carlota Amalia. ==Political career== Luis was elected to the 10th Legislature of the Virgin Islands, the territory's unicameral legislative body, in 1972, when he was 32 years old. He served one, two-year term as a Senator before seeking higher office in 1974. ===Lieutenant governor=== In 1974, two years after his election to the Legislature, gubernatorial candidate Cyril King persuaded Luis to join his ticket as his running mate for lieutenant governor. King had founded the Independent Citizens Movement (ICM) in the 1960s, so he and Luis ran for office as the nominees of the ICM. King and Luis were elected as governor and lieutenant governor in a gubernatorial runoff election held in November 1974, defeating the Democratic ticket of Alexander Farrelly and Ruby Rouss. ===Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands=== Governor Cyril King died in office of stomach cancer at Knud-Hansen Memorial Hospital at 8:06 p.m. on January 2, 1978. Luis, King's lieutenant governor, was sworn into office as the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands ten minutes after King's death to fill the remainder of his term. On February 21, 1978, Governor Luis appointed banker Henry Millin, a Democrat, as his first lieutenant governor in an announcement broadcast on television and radio. Millin was sworn into office on March 10, 1978, at Government House on Saint Thomas. Millin became Luis' running mate in the 1978 gubernatorial election in November. Luis chose to run for governor as an independent candidate, dropping his previous political affiliation with the ICM in the election. Governor Luis and Lt. Governor Millin were elected to a full four- year term on November 7, 1978. Luis defeated the Democratic ticket of Ron de Lugo, the-then Delegate of the U.S. Virgin Islands to the U.S. House of Representatives, and de Lugo's running mate, Senator Eric E. Dawson, in a tough election campaign. Luis won 10,978 votes, or 59.2%, while de Lugo placed second with 7,568 votes, or 40.8% of the total votes cast. Luis won all three major islands in the election, including a landslide win on Saint Croix. Governor Luis and Lt. Governor Millin were inaugurated into a full, four-year term on Thursday, January 4, 1979, at a ceremony in Christiansted. In 1982, Luis announced his campaign for re-election to a second full term. However, Lieutenant Governor Henry Millin chose to challenge Luis in the 1982 gubernatorial election. Luis needed a new running mate and he selected Julio Brady to replace Millin on the ticket. Luis was re-elected to a second term on November 2, 1982, in a five-candidate race. Luis and Brady came in first with 11,354 votes and were declared the winners of the election. His closest challenger, Lt. Governor Henry Millin, placed second with 4,143 votes. However, the election was challenged in court by fourteen Virgin Islands residents, who argued that blank and spoiled ballots should be counted, which would necessitate a runoff election. By law, a gubernatorial candidate in the U.S. Virgin Islands must garner more than 50% of vote to avoid a runoff. Luis would have fallen just short of 50% if blank and spoiled ballots were counted. A lower court in the Virgin Islands agreed with those arguing for a runoff and ordered the blank and spoiled ballots to be counted, which brought Luis below 50%. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia rejected the lower court ruling and allowed blank and spoiled ballots to be excluded, giving Luis an outright majority of the total votes cast. Thus, Luis won re-election to a second term without a runoff. Luis and Lt. Governor Julio Brady were sworn into a second term in January 1983. Governor Luis created a new office, the federal programs coordinator, which worked to better coordinate federal funding and cultivate better relations with U.S. federal agencies, such as the Office of Insular Affairs. Luis is credited by many, including current Governor John de Jongh, with the overhaul and creation of the U.S. Virgin Islands' present health care system during his time in office. Luis successfully lobbied for federal funding which was used to construct most of the U.S. Virgin Islands modern hospitals, including the Governor Juan F. Luis Hospital & Medical Center on Saint Croix, the Myrah Keating Smith Clinic on Saint John and the Schneider Regional Medical Center on Saint Thomas. In education, Luis abolished the practice of holding two separate sessions of school at the same school during the day. Luis spearheaded the expansion of the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on Saint Croix and the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas. He also oversaw the construction of other infrastructure projects, including the creation of a container terminal on Saint Croix. The first desalination plant was constructed by the V.I. Water and Power Authority during Luis' administration. Governor Luis was also credited with launching the political careers of some of the U.S. Virgin Islands' most prominent politicians. They included former Senator Holland Redfield, whom he appointed to the Public Services Commission and encouraged to run for the Legislature in 1984, and Governor John de Jongh, whom Luis nominated to the V.I. Industrial Development Commission, which launched de Jongh's career in public service. Luis was barred from seeking a third consecutive term in the 1986 gubernatorial election due to term limits. He was succeeded by Alexander Farrelly on January 5, 1987. ===Later life=== In 1990, Luis once again ran for election as governor. However, he was defeated by then Governor Alexander Farrelly, who won re-election. Juan Francisco Luis was hospitalized at the Governor Juan F. Luis Hospital & Medical Center on St. Croix on June 3, 2011. He died at the hospital on June 4, 2011, at the age of 70. His funeral mass was held at the Holy Cross Catholic Church in Christiansted. Luis was buried at Kingshill Cemetery in Kingshill, U.S. Virgin Islands following a graveside service, which included a full military tribute by the Virgin Islands National Guard. Luis was survived by his wife, former First Lady Luz Maria Guadalupe Luis; their children, Carlotta Amalia Luis and Juan Francisco Luis Jr.; his sister, Lydia Cintron-Monell; and two brothers, Carlos Monell and Esteban Monell Jr. Luis died less than a week after the passing of another U.S. Virgin Islands political figure, former Lt. Governor Derek Hodge. ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Governors of the United States Virgin Islands Category:Lieutenant Governors of the United States Virgin Islands Category:Senators of the Legislature of the United States Virgin Islands Category:Independent Citizens Movement politicians Category:Interamerican University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:People from Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands Category:People from Vieques, Puerto Rico Category:United States Army soldiers Category:United States Virgin Islands people of Puerto Rican descent Category:United States Virgin Islands military personnel ","title":"Juan Francisco Luis"},{"id":"9103376","text":"Dales is an unincorporated community approximately north east of Red Bluff, on California State Route 36, at the intersection of Manton Road (aka Long Road or Tehama County Highway A6), in Tehama County, California, United States. ==HistoryEarly history=== The name is derived from the Dale family which moved onto the ranch adjacent to Dales Station in 1908. In 1913 Creath Dale purchased this property that previously belonged to the Long family, and before that, the John Norwood Gates family. The Dale home was originally known as the \\"Halfway House\\" when the Gates family owned it, being halfway between the cities of Red Bluff and Manton near Payne's Creek. John Norwood Gates and family resided in the home on or before 1867; John Gates being an early Tehama County pioneer arriving to the area in 1859 with A. A. Kauffman.Lingenfelter, Keith; \\"Tehama County Pioneers\\", Lingenfelter Archives, Meriam Library Special Collection, Cal State University, Chico. http://www.csuchico.edu/lbib/spc/lingenfelter/G/ling_g1.PDF The Halfway House was originally located on the north side of the Payne's Creek waterway, but was disassembled and rebuilt while the Gates' owned it, near its present location on the south side of the creek. The ranch became a routine stop for the local mail stage coach and passenger stages, with livestock and fresh horses being kept in the Dale's barn. The Dale family raised cattle on the ranch, and offered meals and lodging to cattlemen, shepherds and travelers, making it a local landmark. The ranch houses included a wooden structure built in 1922 by the Dales as a service station in response to the popularity of the Ford Model T. Then, in 1937, major flooding in the area destroyed the service station and the wooden bridge that crossed Payne's Creek on the road to Manton. The Dale's home (old Halfway House) survived the flood but floated approximately to its current location. The following year, the Dales rebuilt the Station using stones from the nearby lava beds on their property, ensuring that future floods could not have the same devastating effect. At that time the Dale family began leasing the space to others to run as a restaurant and bar, and finally sold the Station in 1962. The Station had grown in size to accommodate live-in owners and a commercial kitchen, and no longer served as a service station. A popular place for generations, the Station began to fall into disrepair and was finally closed around the year 2000 after the Dales' ranch stopped providing water, due to the water system failing. The live-in owner at that time to had close the business, move out, and she finally lost the property. All of the people on this water system did not pay the Dales for the water they received for years and also not one of the people dependent on that water system offered to pay anything to help restore it. One household that was not family had to move away. The other house was dependent on the water supply. It was torn down as it was in disrepair. The station remained unused for 5 years while it changed investors' hands, falling further into disrepair. In 2006 it was purchased and restored and the restaurant and bar reopened in November 2010 under the revived name of Dales Station. ===Today=== Dales now consists of approximately 25 homes with approximately 70 residents, a few ranches of varying sizes, and a trout farm. The local geography includes vernal pools to the west (Hog Lake) and just north of the Station (Dales Lake), as well as volcanic buttes (Tuscan Buttes, Soap Butte, Inkskip Hill), natural mineral springs, rolling hills of blue oak savannah, several seasonal gulches and the anadromous Payne's Creek, and borders the Sacramento River Bend area. The ancient Indian tribes known as the Yana, including the Yahi and Nomlaki, occupied and flourished in this area for millennia until slaughtered by white settlers in the 1800s. The Ishi Wilderness is a local protected public area dedicated to these Indians, named for Ishi, the last known survivor of the Yahi, who made contact with the modern world in 1911. This area borders other protected areas including wildlife preserves, which are the winter habitat for the migratory Tehama deer herd, the largest migrating deer herd in California. Dales Station is nestled in the heart of a lush valley at . el. on the approach to Lassen Volcanic National Park. The natural environment of this riparian landscape is home to a variety of wildlife, large and small. Bald eagles, hawks, osprey, owls, geese, swans, egrets and heron, duck, doves, quail, turkey, woodpeckers, vultures, jays, and many other birds live in or travel through Dales daily. Payne's Creek behind Dales Station flows year round and spawns trout, salmon, smallmouth bass, Sacramento suckers, squawfish, crayfish, and more. Fox, coyote, raccoon, skunk, and deer are also plentiful in this area. The cottonwood trees and live oak trees towering above Dales Station provide a home and nourishment for many of the local fauna and are a vital part of the local ecosystem. While the landscape of Dales is lush, it is an ancient yet active volcanic terrain, covered with lava boulders, lava beds, volcanic buttes, and climbing hills filled with springs. Dales is on the climb from the northeastern tip of California's Central Valley to the mountainous region where the Sierra Nevada meets the actively volcanic Cascade Mountains. Prior to Mt. St. Helens, Mount Lassen was the last volcano to erupt in the United States in 1914 continuing for over 2 years. Dales Station shares its PO Box ZIP Code (96075) and wired telephone prefixes (Area code 530-597-xxxx) with the community of Paynes Creek, California but it shares a ZIP Code for street addresses with Red Bluff, California (96080). ==Government== In the California State Legislature, Dales is in , and in .

The station is licensed to Waldorf, Maryland, and is co-owned with WKYS-FM, WMMJ, WOL and WYCB and has studios located in Silver Spring, Maryland, with a transmitter located just east of Waldorf. ==History== For many years, 104.1 FM was known as WXTR-FM, an oldies station known as \\"Xtra 104\\", which began in 1976. WXTR, which had been purchased by Liberty Broadcasting, was soon paired with the Frederick, Maryland-licensed WZYQ 103.9 FM (which aired a Top 40 format), in an attempt to attain better signal coverage for WXTR-FM. From that point on, both stations operated as a simulcast throughout a variety of formats: first oldies, then all-70s.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-03-10.pdf Finally, Bonneville purchased the WXTR- FM/WZYQ combo, and changed the format over to CHR at 11 AM on July 11, 1996, as \\"Z104\\" with the call letters WWZZ/WWVZ.http://formatchange.com/xtra-104-becomes-z104/ \\"Z104\\" was Washington, D.C.'s first Top 40 station since the flip of WAVA to Christian programming in 1992. On October 1, 2001, due to new competition from WIHT (which as a full-market signal), Z104 switched to a modern adult contemporary format, playing music by the likes of Dave Matthews Band, Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind.http://fmairchecks.com/2015/10/01/wwvzwwzz-z104-washington- d-c-10101-sean-sellers-rod-hendrix/ The format proved an effective alternative to WIHT and to local stations WWDC (DC101) and WHFS (HFS 99.1), both of which specialized in hard rock. The simulcast also dropped the \\"Z104\\" name in favor of \\"More Music 104\\" and simply \\"104\\" for a while, before reverting to the \\"Z104\\" name on April 8, 2004 at 8:04 AM.http://formatchange.com/z104-segues- from-chr-to-modern-ac/ On January 4, 2006, at Noon, WWZZ went off the air due to a multiple-station format change arranged by Bonneville International. One of the most popular stations in the Washington, D.C., area, all-news station WTOP, expanded its reach by adding 103.5 to its collection, though a new radio station, \\"Washington Post Radio\\", took over WTOP's previous frequencies on March 30, 2006. The previous occupant of 103.5, the classical music station WGMS, was moved to the Z104 frequencies.http://formatchange.com/z104-signs- off/ The WGMS call letters would be moved to 104.1 FM on January 17, while 103.9 FM changed call letters to WGYS six days earlier. On January 22, 2007, at 3 p.m. EST, after the announcement of the end of WGMS (which had aired on various frequencies in the Washington market for 60 years), 104.1/103.9 flipped to adult hits, branded as \\"George 104.\\"http://formatchange.com/classical-wgms-becomes-variety-hits- george-104/Bonneville Moves D.C.'s Classical WGMS to WETA At the time of the format change, Bonneville announced that it had reached a deal with public radio station WETA-FM to return the latter station to a classical format. WETA hired Jim Allison, the longtime program director of WGMS, and Bonneville donated its 15,000-disc WGMS music library to WETA. Bonneville also gave WETA the right to use the WGMS call sign. The format change to \\"George\\" took place after an abortive effort by Bonneville in late 2006 to sell the two frequencies to Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder. Snyder planned to buy WGMS to convert it to a sports radio format, adding its frequencies to the Triple X ESPN Radio network. Snyder withdrew from the preliminary purchase agreement, however, citing \\"a change in the radio climate\\" and hopes that \\"a better signal will soon become available in the market.\\" News accounts suggested that a comment to The Washington Post from an unnamed Bonneville executive, who said Snyder had offered \\"50 percent more than WGMS was worth,\\" had stalled the negotiations. The station used the \\"George\\" moniker (as in George Washington) for its adult hits instead of the usual \\"Jack FM\\", which is trademarked. 104.1 FM would change call letters to WXGG on February 1. \\"George 104\\", however, only lasted about three months. Bonneville announced a local marketing agreement with Radio One for the 104.1 signal on April 6, 2007. 103.9 FM was switched on the same date to a simulcast of WTOP (as WTLP), while the 104.1 frequency went dark in anticipation of a format switch (\\"George\\", meanwhile, moved to WTOP-HD2, though it would eventually be discontinued altogether). \\"Praise 104.1\\" and its current format launched the next morning (Easter Sunday).https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/04/13/AR2007041300438.html On April 24, 2007, WXGG changed their call letters to WPRS.

Stone has written about the religion of Supreme Court justices, notably as to how they relate to judicial decisions about abortion. He has argued that five sitting Catholic judges effectively prevented the legalization of intact dilation and extraction abortion in Gonzales v. Carhart.Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia and Our Six Catholic Justices == Controversy == In March 2019, Stone drew criticism from some students for his long-standing use of the N-word in his classroom discussions of the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. On March 7, 2019, Stone announced that he no longer intended to use the word in class. Stone remarked, \\"My conversation with the African-American students convinced me that the hurt and distraction caused by use of the word in the story are real and to be taken seriously. As a teacher, my goal is to be effective and I decided that use of the word in that story isn‚Äôt sufficiently important to justify the hurt and distraction it causes. For me, this is a great example of why free speech is important. It enables us to learn from each other.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Video interview, May 2004 Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:First Amendment scholars Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:University of Chicago Law School alumni Category:Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American writers Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society ","title":"Geoffrey R.

It is mentioned or cited by Rashi, the Tosafists, Abraham ibn Ezra, Yal·∏≥ut, and Asher ben Jehiel. Rashi on Exodus 26:5,(ed. Berliner) Yalkut Shimoni Genesis 61, calls it \\"Midrash\\"; Rashi on Exodus 27:6 calls it \\"Mishnah\\". == Authorship and character== Ibn Ezra mentions R. Nathan as the author of the Baraita.Yesod Moreh, ed. K√∂nigsberg, 6a Zunz showed, by referring to a number of passages in the Talmud, that the tanna R. Nathan, in both halakhah and aggadah, was accustomed to group things arithmetically, and to arrange his sayings accordingly. On this basis, Zunz conjectured that \\"this lost work of R. Nathan contained a large portion of his Mishnah, and was arranged in rubrics from one to forty-nine; so that each rubric, under the introductory formula \\"Middah,\\" mentioned halakhic, aggadic, and, in general, scientific subjects which belonged in that particular place in regard to number\\".G. V. 2d ed., pp. 95‚Äì97 From the few fragments of this Baraita preserved by the above-mentioned authors, only one fact pertaining to its character can be ascertained, viz., that it contained aggadicYalkut Shimoni l.c. on the seventy nations as well as halakhic matter, especially halakhic topic which involve exact measurement; for instance, the measurement of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.Rashi, l.c. If from these short fragments an opinion could be formed concerning the composition of the Baraita, Zunz's assumption would be justified that it contained aggadah and halakhah numerically arranged. Another assumption of his, however, that it represents the \\"Mishnat R. Nathan\\" mentioned elsewhere, is highly improbable; R. Nathan's Mishnah was in all likelihood only a version of Akiva's Mishnah differing from the authoritative Mishnah. Against Zunz's opinion, compare Eliakim Milsahagi.RABIH, pp. 4b, 7b == The Mishnat ha-Middot == Steinschneider believed that he had put an end to all conjecture concerning the Baraita through a happy find. In the introduction to an edition of Mishnat ha- Middot,Mishnat ha-Middot, die Erste Geometrische Schrift in Hebr√§ischer Sprache (Berlin, 1864) he maintains that this mathematical work, edited by him, is identical with the Baraita under consideration. Were this the case, the Baraita would be a product of the 9th or, at earliest the 8th century, and its birthplace would have to be Babylonia. For, although the scientific terminology of this, the oldest, mathematical work of the Jews shows its origin to have been in a time previous to Arabic influences on Jewish scholarship, yet expressions like ◊ó◊• = Arabic ◊°◊î◊ù (\\"arrow\\") for sinus versus, or ◊û◊©◊ô◊ó◊î = Arabic ◊û◊°◊ê◊ó◊î for measure, area, show that the work could not have been written before the contact of the Jews with the Arabs. But Steinschneider's assumption can hardly be supported. Mishnat ha-Middot has nothing in common with the Baraita cited by the old scholars under that name: for the citations leave no doubt that the Baraita, even in its mathematical parts, was founded on the Bible; whereas the Mishnat ha-Middot is a purely secular work, and, possibly, it drew upon the same source as did Mohammed b. Musa, the oldest Arabic mathematician. The argument that the Mishnat ha-Middot has not been preserved in its entirety, and that in its original form there were references to the Bible for special points, is of no weight, since it is absolutely incomprehensible that aggadic or halakhic matter should fit into the frame of the work as it now is. The same reason demolishes the hypothesis of the German translator of the Mishnat ha-Middot,Abhandlung zur Geschichte d. Mathematik, in Supplement to Zeitschrift f√ºr Mathematik und Physik, 1880; H. Schapira, Mishnat ha-Midoth . . . ins Deutsche Uebersetzt who assumes that there was a Mishnah with the Gemara on it, and that citations of the old scholars refer to the Gemara, whereas the printed text represents the Mishnah (compare the tanna R. Nathan, and Baraita on the Erection of the Tabernacle). ==References Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === *Abraham b.

It receives its name from Numbers 11:16: \\"Gather unto me [\\"Esfah-li\\"] seventy men of the elders of Israel.\\" In Yalkut Shimoni ¬ß736 appears a citation relating to this verse, which cannot be traced to any other midrash, and is doubtless taken from Midrash Esfah. To this midrash may possibly be referred a passage in the Halakot Gedoloted. Warsaw, p. 282b and a fragment on Numbers 17:14, 20:1-3,In Wertheimer, Batte Midrashot, iii. 8-10 which agrees in its concluding words with the excerpt in Yalkut Shimoni Numbers ¬ß763 on Numbers 20:3 (found also ¬ß262, on Exodus 17:2, which begins with the same words). The name of the midrash shows that it must have begun with Numbers 11:16. The other excerpts in Yalkut Shimoni from Midrash Esfah - ¬ß¬ß 737, 739, 742, 764, 773, and 845 - are based on Numbers 11:24, 12:3-7, 12:12, 21:9, 26:2 (found also at ¬ß684, on Numbers 1:2, which begins with the same words), and Deuteronomy 6:16. However, the extent of the midrash cannot be determined. The interesting extract in Yalkut Shimoni Numbers on Numbers 11:16 names the seventy elders in two of its recensions (a third recension of this passage is furnished by a Vatican library manuscript); and one of these versions concludes with a noteworthy statement which justifies the inference that the midrash was taught in the academy of ·∏§anina Gaon by Rabbi Samuel, brother of Rabbi Phinehas. It would seem, therefore, that the midrash was composed in Babylon in the first half of the 9th century.

The collapses have a number of causes, including overloading due to excessive weight from overoccupancy (too many people). Overoccupancy can result from guests filling a porch at a party, from people seeking cooler breezes during a heat wave, or from people filling a porch while seeking shelter from the rain. It may be from the weight of furniture/appliances, wading pools, or air conditioner compressors. After years of rain and snow, it may be from rotted wood, soil subsidence under the porch foundation, rust of nails and fasteners, and not being built to specifications required by modern-day building codes. Many older porches were built before codes required them to be able to support a legally mandated load of so many pounds per square foot or metre, and porches are often not as sturdily built as interior structures. The phenomenon is associated with older multistorey apartment buildings with wooden porches. Architect Stanley Tigerman said that in New York City one finds steel fire escapes, but in Chicago, the distance to alleys behind multistorey brick buildings encouraged the construction of wooden multistorey porches. While not an everyday occurrence, collapses happen often enough in Chicago that city building inspectors make a point of checking porches when making inspections. People have been killed and injured by collapses of wooden porches in other cities as well. A Chicago porch collapse during a get-together in the Lincoln Park neighborhood in 2003 killed 13 people. The weight of approximately 70 people caused the recently renovated porch of the 1890s vintage building to fail. The disaster inspired a 2005 episode of the ER television show. In June 2008, a third-story balcony collapsed in Ottawa, injuring six persons.Ottawa balcony collapse victims in induced comas ==Deck collapse== A related hazard is the collapse of decks built as outdoor extensions of single-family homes. When decks became a popular feature, construction practice did not keep up with the new fashion, resulting in many decks that were simply nailed to the side of their houses. The inherently weak connections were prone to failure, resulting in collapse with injuries and occasional death. In recent years building codes have been re-written to require direct structural connection to the adjoining structure, as well as cross-bracing to withstand sway. ==High-rise apartments== High-rise apartment buildings are typically constructed from reinforced concrete. Many buildings have been designed with the concrete slab extending through the exterior walls to form balconies. Since they are relatively thin and unprotected from the weather, they are vulnerable to corrosion of reinforcing and potential collapse.

Two ships are sent out to set up both an industrial colony on Saturn's moon Titan and a recreational colony on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. The film covers the background of the mission, as well as several radio conversations between the leaders of the two separate colonizing missions, the female Seagull and the male Falcon, who are implied to be in a romantic relationship. Besides colonizing the two moons, part of the mission is also to set up an archive of Socialist culture within the vacuum of space. For reasons not explained within the film, the mission fails, and all records of it are either destroyed or hidden away. However, the last scene reveals Seagull and Falcon to be still alive, as they converse about other failed secret Soviet space missions, most of which resulted in the demise of the entire crew. ==Reception== The Village Voices Dennis Lim called Interkosmos a \\"a retro gust of Communist utopianism\\" stating that it \\"weaves together lovingly faked archival footage, charmingly undermotivated musical numbers, propagandistic maxims (\\"Capitalism is like a kindergarten of boneless children\\"), stop-motion animation (of a suitably crude GDR-era level), a Teutonic (and vaguely Herzogian) voiceover, and a superb garage-y Kraut-rock score (by Jim Becker and Colleen Burke). Finn's deadpan is immaculately bone- dry, and his antiquarian fastidiousness is worthy of Guy Maddin.\\" Wireds Jason Silverman ranked Interkosmos alongside Automatons, Puzzlehead, and The Wild Blue Yonder as \\"Best Shoestring Sci-Fi of 2006\\" stating that \\"At times, Interkosmos' hip, deadpan style threatens to grow tiresome, but then Finn injects something unexpected to liven it up. By the end, Interkosmos has coalesced into a colorful portrait of an imagined time where movies and space travel were happy, bubbly things.\\" ==References*Variety review *Village Voice review *Thrill Jockey website *Chicago Reader review Category:2006 films Category:2006 drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:German-language films Category:American drama films Category:Films about astronauts ","title":"Interkosmos (film)"},{"id":"9103843","text":"71 Tauri is a suspected triple star system in the zodiac constellation Taurus, located 146 light years from the Sun.

He was called the Indian Demosthenes.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , pp 480‚Äì481, Sengupta, Nitish, 2001/2002, History of the Bengali-speaking People, p 228, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd., Ghosh was one of the persons who helped John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune to establish his girls school.Acharya, Poromesh, Education in Old Calcutta in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp 87, Oxford University Press, . ==Early life== The family hailed from Bagati, near Mogra in Hooghly District. His father, Gobinda Chandra Ghosh had a small shop in Kolkata's China Bazar. His maternal grandfather, Dewan Ramprasad Singha, used to work in the office of King Hamilton & Co. in Kolkata. Ghosh was born in his maternal grandfather's house.Sastri, Sivanath, Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Bangasamaj, 1903/2001, p 76-80, New Age Publishers Pvt. Ltd. There are two opinions about his childhood. The first says that he initially joined Sherburne's School and started learning English. At that time Hara Chandra Ghosh, then a student of Hindu College and later one of the leading Derozians, married a relative of his. Observing the keenness of young Ramgopal, Hara Chandra pestered the former's father to get him admitted in Hindu College. His father did not have the means to pay for his education at Hindu College. However, one Mr. Rogers of King Hamilton & Co. agreed to pay the fees and he was admitted to Hindu College. The second opinion is that Mr. Rogers got him admitted in Hindu College right from the beginning. Ghosh did not have to continue that way for long. His brilliance attracted the attention of David Hare and soon he was on the latter's free student list. In time he joined the class of Derozio. He became friendly with Ramtanu Lahiri and the other Derozians. His dedication attracted Derozio's attention and he used to coach him in English philosophy and poetry outside class hours. When Derozio established the Academic Association, Ghosh became one of its leading members. It was in the meeting of the Association that Ghosh learnt to express himself fluently in English. The meetings of the Academic Association were attended by such people as Sir Edward Ryan, who was a judge of the Supreme Court and W.W.Bird, who later became lieutenant governor of Bengal. They warmly appreciated Ghosh's talent and openly encouraged him. ==Business activities== Ghosh had to leave his studies unfinished and get on in working life. On the recommendation of David Hare, he started working with a Jewish businessman named Joseph. Later, another businessman name Kelsall joined the firm, Ghosh served them as a middle-man. When the two fell out, Ghosh formed a jointly owned firm Kelsall, Ghose & Co., and still later, around 1848, he floated his own firm, R.G.Ghosh & Co. In the process he accumulated fabulous wealth. One of the great qualities of Ghosh was that he never forgot his old friends. Even as he went up the financial and social ladder he kept close contact with them and helped them whenever they were in need. There were occasions when he helped his old friends such as Ramtanu Lahiri and Rasik Krishna Mallick. When his grand father died, there was a hue and cry in society that he was opposed to Hindu religion and there was possibility of his being ostracised. His father appealed to him to declare publicly his faith in Hindu religion but he turned to his father and said, \\"I am ever willing to obey you and bear any pains for that but I cannot tell a lie.\\" When this spread around, he gained in the esteem in society. On another occasion his business had nosedived and there was possibility of his becoming bankrupt. His friends advised him to transfer his assets to others but he refused to follow an illegal path. His personal integrity has been acknowledged even by more recent historians.Sengupta, Nitish, p232. ==Oration and social reforms== His speeches on the Black Acts (1850), which aimed at bringing disputes between Europeans and Asians under the jurisdiction of the Company's courts and those criticising the European protests against a well-intentioned government move to bring Europeans on par with the natives in judicial treatment were a landmark. He was the first, as early as 1853, to demand the eligibility of Indians in the civil service examinations. In 1854, he was the first Indian to propose the establishment of universities in India. He supported the move of Dwarkanath Tagore to send four students to England for higher medical studies. Ghosh not only delivered fiery speeches but also wrote effectively. His publication of a booklet A Few Remarks on Certain Draft Acts, Commonly Called Black Acts so angered the English that he was forced out of his position as vice-president of the Agri- Horticultural Society. He was closely associated with the publications of the time, such as Jnananwesan and Bengal Spectator. He took an active part in the establishment of the British Indian Association and was a member of its committee.Sastri, Sivanath, pp 115‚Äì116, He not only indulged in politics but also other causes. It was at his initiative that a decision was taken to erect a statue of David Hare. He was the first to offer one month's income for the purpose; others followed and the statue stands to this day in the compound of Presidency College. In his last days, he wrote off loans totalling Rs. 40,000 given to his friends. ==References== Category:1815 births Category:1868 deaths Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:Bengali people Category:Businesspeople from Kolkata Ghosh Ramgopal Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Young Bengal Category:Founders of Indian schools and colleges Category:Indian social reformers Category:19th-century Indian businesspeople ","title":"Ramgopal Ghosh"},{"id":"9103878","text":"Under Cover Man is a 1932 American pre-Code crime film directed by James Flood and starring George Raft and Nancy Carroll.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013, page 34. ==Plot== Criminal Nick Darrow goes undercover to get the gangsters who killed his father.

It has since then contributed to the increasing success of international micro financing. Microfinance stills remains a relatively new in Tanzania since it has not penetrated yet. Since 1995, microfinance has been linked to poverty alleviation programs and women (Harvey et al., 2018). The government made efforts to ensure commercial banks have continued to provide financial support to the small entrepreneurial business. However a microfinance National Policy was implemented in 2002 to encourage and support microfinances in the country. Since the implementation, micro financing was officially launched and recognized as a poverty alleviation tool. Due to its increase exposure and use in the nation, commercial banks have developed interests in to offer microfinance. There are various microfinance banks that functions as supporting institutions in the country that usually provide microfinance services. These may include the CRDB, National Microfinance Bank, and AKIBA (Lindvert et al., 2018). However there are also other few banks that are concerned with micro financing in Tanzania such as the PRIDE and SEDA, Tanzania Postal Bank and FINCA. Community and small banks have also expressed interest in the same including the NGOs and other non-profit organizations. According to the Survey conducted recently (2005) by the Bank of Tanzania, the ministry of Finance provided an update of the microfinance practitioners‚Äô directory including other basic information regarding the institutions practicing micro financing as well as financial institutions,, commercial banks, SACCOS and NGOs and other credit institutions. Below is a list of three major commercial banks in Tanzania that provides microfinance services (Lindvert et al., 2018). ==Commercial banks in TanzaniaNational Microfinance Bank=== This bank could probably constitute to the closest to state bank that the country has. The bank originated from the reconstruction of the NBC (National Bank of Commerce, through parliamentary Act after the mandate of the NBC was terminated following the monopoly it had in commercial banking in the country (Lindvert et al., 2018). The national microfinance bank (NBM) was registered by the registrar of companies and operates under the supervision of the Bank of Tanzania in the prudential supervision and licensing. Its main source of finances are capital and deposits which makes it a self ‚Äìsustainable and independent institution. It usually enjoys the advantage of its network as well as its size which currently has about one hundred and four branches and agencies in almost every district in Tanzania with only twelve of its branches offering microfinance services. However the bank has a plan of adding about sixteen more offices and branches which would allow operations of microfinance services. Besides it size, its various microfinance operations usually have considerable stature (Mwizarubi et al., 2016). Generally, its outstanding portfolio is about Tsh. 907.5 million towards the end of year 2001, with an average of 246 US dollars for each account. The various loans offered by this bank is usually similar to the loans offered by other microfinance such as CRDB and AKIBA. These loans are made to specific individuals, groups as well as other small business entrepreneurs. The basic product relating to microfinance that is offered in this bank is the saving deposits which offers the best and easiest way of acquiring a loan at NMB and also the most reliable way of acquiring a loan (Harvey et al., 2018). The bank expands and facilitates microfinance in three different methods which includes providing loans to small businesses for purchasing inventory and supply of commodities, collecting and paying clients to or from small and micro enterprises. NMB encourages and expands microfinance in three ways: * Loans to micro and small enterprises for the purchase and inventory and supply of goods * Collection and payment services to large corporate clients to/from micro and small enterprises * Add-on services such as money transfers and payroll services to both the large corporate clients and micro and small enterprises ===AKIBA Bank=== The bank has various branches in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam and in Moshi and Arusha. It has managed to take an approach which is relatively risky to microfinance through embracing and extending it within their different activities (Lindvert et al., 2018). Most of the microfinance services offered by this bank in Tanzania are mainly saving deposits. They usually operate under the Bank of Tanzania with their licensing being done by the Companies‚Äô Act. Currently, they are self-sustainable with their funding source being from the various deposits and capital. AKIBA bank was the first bank in the country to pioneer Micro financing and have realized great success was having current loans totaling to Tsh. 18 billion. AKIBA less outreach than such big banks like the NMB and hence have sufficient time to focus on its microfinance services. The bank can attribute its success to the provision of services outside the usual financial services such as the teaching of invaluable business practices and deposits and savings as well. However, they have a challenge which is closely related to their success and their logistic planning. This is due to the increasing success such as the increased research and development, mobilization of more deposits to ensure loan demands are met human resource recruitment and training, and management of more improved management information systems (MIS) due to increased competition among other managerial issues (Harvey et al., 2018). ===CRDB Bank === CRDB stands for Cooperatives Rural and Development Bank, however, it is not a cooperative. This privately owned bank is one of the oldest banking institutions in Tanzania and the third largest bank in Tanzania (The National Bank of Commerce and the National Microfinance Bank which split from NBC are the two largest banks). CRDB has 22 branches and two agencies in Tanzania. CRDB's endeavors in microfinance are fairly recent, with pilots in only 4 branches. CRDB was also created under the Companies' Act and is under the authority of the Bank of Tanzania (external regulation and supervision). However, unlike the other three commercial banks in microfinance, its primary source of funding comes from The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) which serves as one of CRDB's single largest shareholders. CRDB is different from the other two national banks in that it primarily provides loans to microfinance institutions such as SACCOS (the largest type of MFI in this program). CRDB as a more conservative bank has taken this approach in order to reduce their risks in microfinance by loaning to groups such as SACCOs instead of micro and small enterprise borrowers. CRDB provides SACCOs with financial stability. CRDB's total assets are as of June 2003 US $370 million. Its total customer deposits account for US$330 million. Its pre-tax profit lies at US$7.4 million. Its total loans and advances (including microfinance loans to smaller microfinance institutions) are US$60 million. ===Tanzania Postal Bank=== The Tanzania Postal Bank is the 4th commercial bank that is involved in microfinance. Like the National Microfinance Bank, the Tanzania Postal Bank was created by an Act of Parliament and like the previous three banks, it too is under the Companies Registrar and under Tanzania Postal Bank Act No.11 of 1991 as amended by Act No.11 of 1992 ==Other microfinance in TanzaniaYetu Microfinance=== Yetu Microfinance provides various financial services to the unbanked and under-banked people of Tanzania. The company offers credit products, such as solidarity group loans for clients who are organized into groups whose members serve as informal bank and cross-guarantee each other's loans; Mavuno loan products to afford members of solidarity group loan who have reached a loan ceiling of TZS 3 million and would like to borrower on individual capacity; small and medium enterprises loan products, including export and import, car, business/shop improvement, business capital, and processing and manufacturing loans; SRI agricultural loans; mixed farming loans to smallholder farmers for financing various crops; and instant loans, as well as education loans. Its deposit products comprise compulsory (collateral) savings; and voluntary deposits. Yetu Microfinance PLC has branches in Mzizima, Mbagala, Ifakara, Zanzibar, Kilwa, Lindi, Amani-Tanga and Mngeta. The company was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. === Tunakopesha Limited === Tunakopesha Limited is a microfinance institution founded in 1992 that provides individual loans for salaried employees, group loans as well as business loans for small and medium enterprises. It operates through 54 branches in 25 regions across the country. Following along the path of the Company‚Äôs ethos ‚Äì \\"Enriching lives\\" ‚Äì the company is mindful of its corporate responsibility and hence supports various social sectors, especially the education sector. == Impact of microfinance in Tanzania == While the concept of microfinance is relatively new to Tanzania, the impacts of its introduction are already visible. Smallholder farmers have been especially affected by this change, since Tanzania has a majority agricultural-based economy. Credit facilities without collateral damage have allowed farmers to grow their business, by buying products like fertilizer and more advanced equipment to boost productivity, and profit from their harvest without the threat of inescapable debt. Microfinance has also provided non- farming rural citizens with employment opportunities by allowing them to more easily launch small businesses, such as carpentry and food vending. Although the adoption of this economic practice is somewhat low in rural households, studies show that if fully adopted, microfinance could collectively raise the incomes of Tanzanians living in rural areas. This statistic becomes even more significant when paired with the fact that 90% of the impoverished in Tanzania live in the countryside and thus, rural households make up the majority of those unqualified for conventional banking services. Not only has microfinance affected socioeconomic status within Tanzania, it has also improved gender inequality within disadvantaged communitiesMtamakaya, C., Kessy, J., Jeremia, D., Msuya, S., & Stray-Pedersen, B. (2018). The impact of microfinance programmes on access to healthcare, knowledge to health indicators and health status among women in Moshi, Tanzania. Tanzania Journal of Health Research, 20(2). https://www.ajol.info/index.php/thrb/article/view/149638/158969. One study‚Äôs results have shown a 90% increase in women-owned businesses and over 80% decrease in female genital mutilation and reported sexual assault in correlation with the introduction of microfinance. This introduction has also been found to be consistent with less absences from schoolKesanta, J., & Andre, B. (2015).

And while these services have not shown to improve Tanzanians‚Äô access to healthcare, they do appear to alleviate the stress of health-related costs, especially for parents. Overall, while the details on microfinance‚Äôs impact on Tanzanian society and economy are yet to be determined, its implementation has certainly created a new financial culture based around saving and taking loans, replacing the previous negative stigma surrounding these practices. == Works Cited == Harvey, S., Lees, S., Mshana, G., Pilger, D., Hansen, C., Kapiga, S., & Watts, C.

He reveals that he dreamt of Leigh's death years ago, and doesn't understand why he goes on living when they were the same, both longing for things that can't be found in this world, and in a sense, Heaven. ==Troy and Heaven== Troy and Heaven became lovers and intended to marry. Their happiness was cut short, however, when Tony revealed they were in fact uncle and niece, as he had raped Heaven's mother, and was in fact Heaven's father. Devastated, Heaven went on to marry Logan Stonewall when she believed Troy had died, yet upon his return they had one more night together, resulting in the birth of their daughter Annie. Troy and Heaven never saw each other again, and when she died and was buried on the Farthingale estate, Troy was seen by his daughter as a ghost figure who visited Heaven's grave and wept for his lost love. ==Annie Stonewall== Annie Stonewall is Troy's daughter who was raised by Logan, and only later discovered the truth of her parentage after her mother's death.

An error occurs in the series, however, as Tony tells Heaven in Dark Angel (written by V. C.

It no longer exists, except in references by later authorities. Jonah ibn Janah is the oldest authority who drew upon this Baraita, but he did not mention it by name. Rashi makes frequent use of it in his commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud. He either briefly calls it the thirty-two rulesHor. 3a or designates it as the \\"Baraita (or sections [pirkei]) of R. Eliezer b. Jose ha- Gelili\\".Gen. 2:8; Exodus 14:24 Also the Karaite Judah Hadassi, who incorporated it in his Eshkol ha-Kofer, recognized in it the work of this R. Eliezer. == Authorship == The beraita has not been preserved in an independent form, and knowledge of it has been gathered only from the recension transmitted in the methodological work Keritot, by Samson of Chinon. The beginning of the Baraita in this recension reads as follows: \\"Whenever you come across the words of R. Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili, make a funnel of your ear.\\" Though this sentence already existed in the Baraita as known to Hadassi,See W. Bacher, in Monatsschrift, 40:21 it is naturally a later addition taken from the Talmud;·∏§ul. 89a but it shows that the Baraita of the Thirty-two Rules was early regarded as the work of Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili. There are strong grounds for the supposition that the opening sentence of the Baraita ran: \\"R. Eliezer, the son of R. Jose the Galilean, said.\\" This is the reading of Joshua ha-Levi and Isaiah Horowitz;See Bloch, p. 53 and it is believed that the name of the author did not drop out until the addition of the sentence from the Talmud. Consequently, no adequate reasons exist for doubting the authorship of R. Eliezer. Moshe Zucker sought to prove, from Geniza documents, that the Baraita of the 32 Rules was written by Shemuel b. Hofni Gaon (d. 1013) as part of the introduction to his commentary to the Torah.In Vol. XXIII of the Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research (1954) This conclusion has been challenged by A. Greenbaum.'The Biblical Commentary of Samuel ben Hofni Gaon' (Mosad HaRav Kook 1978) Distinction must, however, be made between two different constituent elements of the Baraita. The enumeration of the 32 hermeneutic rules in the first section constitutes the real Baraita as composed by R. Eliezer; and the explanations of each rule in the following 32 sections form, as it were, a gemara to the real Baraita. In these 32 sections sayings are cited of the tannaim R. Akiva, R. Ishmael, R. Jose, R. Nehemiah, R. Nehorai, Rebbi, ·∏§iyyah, and of the amoraim Johanan and Jose b. ·∏§anina. Although these names (especially the last two) show that portions of the Baraita were interpolated long after Eliezer b. Jose, no general conclusions may be drawn from it with regard to the whole work. The terminology is prevailingly tannaitic, even in the second portion. W. Bacher correctly remarks that the exclusively tannaitic expression \\"zeker le-dabar\\" is found at the end of section 9.Terminologie der J√ºdischen Schriftauslegung, p. 101. Compare also the archaic phrase \\"hashomea' sabur\\" for which \\"at sabur\\" is usually said The second part, therefore, leaving later interpolations out of consideration, may also have sprung from the tannaitic period, probably from the school of R. Eliezer. It is noteworthy that the old scholars make citations from the Baraita that are not found in its present form, thus casting a doubt upon the correctness of the present recension.See Reifmann, pp. 6, 7 According to modern scholar Moshe Zucker, this work was in fact only written in the 10th century.Moshe Zucker, \\"LePitaron Baayat 32 Middot uMishnat R' Eliezer\\", PAAJR 23 (1954), p. 1-39 == Hermeneutics == The 32 rules are those applied in aggadic interpretations (◊î◊í◊ì◊î is the right reading and not ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î). This entirely characterizes the method of the Baraita; for although it incorporates the most important halakhic rules of interpretation, which originated in the schools of R. Akiva and of R. Ishmael (Hillel), the Baraita deals principally with the syntax, style, and subject-matter of the Bible. Such treatment is of first importance for the interpretation of the Scriptures; but in halakhah it is of subordinate value. The Baraita, then, written about 150 CE, may be regarded as the earliest work on Biblical hermeneutics, since Philo's fantastic allegories can hardly be regarded as such. Following are two examples from the Baraita, which illustrate its method. * Section 9 (on the elliptical phraseology of the Bible) says: \\"I Chronicles 17:5 reads, 'I have gone from tent to tent, and from tabernacle' ('u-mimishkan'). It should read: 'and from tabernacle to tabernacle' ('u-mimishkan el mishkan'); but the Bible here employs ellipsis.\\" * Section 21 says that sometimes a clause that ought to stand at the end of sentences, conveying one idea, is interposed between them. Thus, the correct place for Psalms 34:17 would be after 34:18. According to the last rule, whole chapters of the Bible should be transferred. Thus, Genesis 15 chronologically precedes Genesis 14. These examples show that in Palestine scholars early began to devote themselves to a rational Bible exegesis, although free play was at the same time yielded to aggadic interpretation. ==References== == Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography == *W.

There he meets young widow Peggy Harmon and her son Dickie. She eventually falls in love with him, and he likes her too. When Jimmy finds out that she will have to cut short her son's treatment because she will not receive an insurance payout, Jimmy takes on a tough fight in Tijuana to raise the $600 she needs. The marks on his face show Peggy where the money came from. Jimmy returns to New York. After one fight, he is introduced by Roger Elliot to flighty, flirty socialite Joan Gibson. He soon falls for her, and he mistakes her interest in him as love. When Pop Slavin, Jimmy's manager, arranges for him to fight for the lightweight championship, Jimmy turns it down. Instead, he secretly goes to a plastic surgeon to have his nose and cauliflower ear fixed after Joan remarks that he would almost be handsome if it were not for those features. He gets etiquette lessons from Forbes. When he springs his surprise on Joan, she is not amused. She complains to a friend that he is no longer different and colorful. Jimmy has Pop set up fights with lesser foes. He changes his style, boxing rather than punching, to avoid risking damage to his new face. The fans boo him. Meanwhile, Pop sends for Peggy. Jimmy has to tell her that he is seeing someone else. Joan's butler tells Jimmy that she is not home, but he bursts in on her party. He tells her that he will fight one last time, for the championship, after which - win or lose - they will get married. He sends her ringside tickets. The night of the fight, Jimmy is concerned when he does not see Joan there. He sends Rosebud to call and find out where she is. After one round, in which Jimmy once again avoids contact, Rosebud reports that Joan is leaving on an ocean liner in about twenty minutes. Jimmy attacks furiously and knocks out the champion. Then he takes a taxi to the pier. When he finds Joan, she lies and tells him that her sister needs her, but when Roger Elliot enters the cabin, it all becomes clear. Jimmy punches Roger and kicks Joan when she bends over Roger's unconscious body. Jimmy then proposes to Peggy. ==Cast== *James Cagney as Jimmy Kane *Marian Nixon as Peggy Harmon *Guy Kibbee as Pop Slavin *Dickie Moore as Dickie Harmon *Virginia Bruce as Joan Gibson *Alan Mowbray as Forbes *Esther Howard as Ann *Clarence Muse as Rosebud, Jimmy's trainer *Clarence Wilson as Ben Isaacs *Ralf Harolde as Legs Davis, diamond ring seller *John Roche as Roger Elliot *Texas Guinan as Herself (clip from Queen of the Night Clubs) *Gabby Hayes as Intern at Rosario Ranch (uncredited) *George Raft as a bandleader (clip from Queen of the Night Clubs) ==References* Category:1932 romantic drama films Category:1930s sports drama films Category:American boxing films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Roy Del Ruth Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Lord (screenwriter) Category:1932 drama films Category:1932 films Category:American sports drama films ","title":"Winner Take All (1932 film)"},{"id":"9104002","text":"The Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium is the corporation responsible for administering Canada's telecommunication numbering resources.

Composed by the Noble Lady, Diana Primrose (London, 1630). It is thought that this piece was written not only as a tribute to the 45-year reign of Elizabeth but as a criticism of the sometimes hot-headed King James, as well as a social criticism. The Chaine itself is made up of ten \\"Pearles\\" or short poems detailing virtues found in Elizabeth; some of these Pearles however are not qualities directly attributed to Elizabeth and thus it is considered that they may present a criticism of the then current ruler. Some have contended that the poet used an allegorical pseudonym, the concordance between the goddess Diana (referred to in the text) and the author Diana presents an interesting conflict. Upon closer observation, the author's name itself is a tribute to Elizabeth Tudor. Diana as stated above often used as a symbol of Elizabeth and her fame as the virgin queen, Primrose being the flower of England. Elizabeth was often referred to as the rose of England, and as head of state that would make her the PRIME ROSE of England.Anonymous. Flower Info. 2004. April 2010 Thus the primrose became a symbol of her monarchy. The symbolic nature of the author's name calls into question its potentiality for being a nom de plume. It is possible that the author used this name to add further emphasis on the queen, and that the real author is in fact another female writer of some renown. The Primrose family however, was well established; there is, however, no record of a \\"Diana\\". In 1805 John Nichols identified Anne Clifford as the author, but while there is some circumstantial evidence, nothing definitive has come to light, considering a conflict with recorded publishing date (Nichols attributes the publication to 1603 rather than 1630) A Chaine of Pearle takes the first part of William Camden's Annals of Queen Elizabeth (1615) as its source, as well as Spenser's Faerie Queene and listing, as it does, the virtues of Elizabeth I‚Äîthe \\"pearles\\" of the title‚Äîit is generally considered to have been a pointed criticism of James I. The entire piece is constructed as though it were a chain of pearls, each separate poem another pearl on the chain that reflects Elizabeth's own beauty of character as both a woman and a ruler, devoid of gender; the pearls representing qualities such as \\"Chastity\\", \\"Religion\\", \\"Prudence\\", and \\"Temperance\\" (Spenser). Primrose however also uses other qualities not attributed to Elizabeth such as \\"Patience\\" opening the possibility of criticisms of either Elizabeth's predecessors or more likely her successor James I (Primrose, A Chaine of Pearle). ==Works== *A Chaine of Pearle, Or a Memoriall of the peerles Graces, and Heroick Vertues of Queene Elizabeth of Glorious Memory.

London: Printed for Thomas Paine, and are to be sold by Philip Waterhouse at his shop at the signe of St. Paul's-head in Canning Street neare London-stone, 1630. The following is a short edition regarding \\"The Induction\\" to \\"A Chaine of Pearl\\", including footnotes, and specific to the symbology of the piece. Wildly symbolic, this introduction to the longer A Chaine of Pearle by Diana Primrose was written to eulogise the deceased Queen Elizabeth the first, during the reign of James the sixth of Scotland (Castelli). It is thought that this piece was not only written as a tribute to the forty five-year reign of Elizabeth but as a criticism of the sometimes hot-headed King, as well as a social criticism. The Chaine itself is made up of ten Pearles or short poems detailing virtues that were found in Elizabeth, some of these Pearles however are not qualities directly attributed to Elizabeth and thus it is considered that they may present a criticism of the then current ruler. The use of the metaphor of a pearl chain sets the tone for the eulogy and illustrates from the beginning the symbolic nature of the peace. The pearl is the oldest known gem, found in the sarcophagus of a Princess of Persia who died in 520 BC (Anonymous, Pearls in Human History). Since its discovery the pearl has been a symbol of purity and perfection and has been recognised as the gem of royalty due to each pearl's unique design no pearl being exactly the same; its formation also signifies strength of character (Anonymous, The Rich History of Pearls). Images of Elizabeth show that the pearl adorned many of her garments, found in the intricate embroidery of her gowns and worn in long ropes around her neck, even attached to pins worn in her hair, and it is assumed that it was her favourite gem in addition to being a symbol of her purity and virginity, they effectively became her robes of state. The entire piece is constructed as though it were a chain of pearls, each separate poem another pearl on the chain that reflects Elizabeth's own beauty of character as both a woman and a ruler, devoid of gender; the pearls representing qualities such as ‚ÄúChastity‚Äù, ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrudence‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTemperance‚Äù (Spenser). Primrose however also uses other qualities not attributed to Elizabeth such as ‚ÄúPatience‚Äù opening the possibility of criticisms of either Elizabeth's predecessors or more likely her successor James VI (Primrose, A Chaine of Pearle). It is here that the criticisms come into play more heavily. The regard that the people of England had for their Queen, transcended her gender, a fact exploited by Primrose in her blatant disregard for gender roles within her piece; By putting emphasis on sex as opposed to gender Primrose relies on the physical distinctions between men and women as opposed to societally imposed gender roles, roles which Elizabeth as an unmarried political ruler openly flouted. This carries over into ‚ÄúThe Induction‚Äù of the piece itself as she compares Elizabeth to both male and female characters of classical Roman literature (Primrose, A Chaine of Pearle). Primrose uses the virgin queen as a reflection of the union between masculine and feminine natures. Beginning with a comparison to the Roman God of the sun Phoebus, and then to the Goddess of the moon and chastity, Diana (Anonymous, UNRV History). These comparisons unite in records of Elizabeth's nature, and show that she is equal in strength to men, and yet retains her feminine charms. This edition includes only the opening two short pieces by Primrose, allowing the editor to focus on the emphasis of symbology evident throughout the entire piece, but most clear in ‚ÄúThe Induction‚Äù. A Chaine of Pearle ‚ÄúTo All Noble Ladies and Gentlewomen‚Äù To you, the honour of our noble sex, I send this chain with all my best respects, Which if you please to wear for her sweet sake, For whom I did this slender poem make, :You shall erect a trophy to her name, :And crown yourselves with never-ending fame . ‚ÄúThe Induction‚Äù As golden Phoebus with his radiant face Enthroned in his triumphant chair of state, The twinkling stars and asterisms doth chase With his imperial scepter, and doth hate All consorts in his starry monarchy As prejudicial to his sovereignty, Written for a female audience Primrose calls attention to women's ability to be involved in politics and offer criticisms similar to Elizabeth herself. Primrose uses ‚Äúsex‚Äù not ‚Äúgender‚Äù implying and emphasis on the physical difference instead of societal conventions. Queen Elizabeth I Make yourselves more noticeable and strong by being more like the Queen. The Roman God of the Sun, implying a strength and power equal to that of men. Implying a comparison to Diana, Roman goddess of the moon. Implies equality between Phoebus and Diana and thus equality between men and women. So great Eliza, England's brightest sun, The world's renown and ever-lasting lamp, Admits not here the least comparison, Whose glories do the greatest princes damp, That ever scepter swayed or crown did wear, Within the verge of either hemisphere. Thou English goddess, empress of our sex, O thou whose name still reigns in all our hearts, To whom are due our ever-vow‚Äôd respects, How shall I blazon thy most royal parts? Which in all parts did so divinely shine, As they deserve Apollo's quill (not mine). Yet, since the gods accept the humble vows Of mortals, deign, O thou star-crowned queen T‚Äôaccept these ill- composed pearly rows, Wherein thy glory chiefly shall be seen; For by these lines so black and impolite, Thy swan-like lustre shall appear more white . Thy imperial majesties eternal votary, Diana lessen Role model for all women Emphasis on physical sex not conventional gender. Refers to great acts, and burning them in the memory of the world. Roman god of truth, implying the piece does not do the Queen justice. Gods accept the prayers of lesser beings, so should Elizabeth accept this praise. Hearkens back to the chain of pearls The poem is so much less than what she deserves that it appears blackened and ruinous beside her. The darkness of the poem in comparison to Elizabeth will make her seem even more royal and divine. The vows of a nun, implying the author is worshiping of Elizabeth. Also speaks to Elizabeth's devotion to her people, shown through her unmarried state. Shows devotion of both Author and the Goddess. ==References== ==Resources== *Greer, Germaine, et al., eds. \\"Diana Primrose.\\" Kissing the Rod: an anthology of seventeenth-century women's verse.

Weekend syndicated hosts include Clark Howard, The Kim Komando Show, The Weekend with Joe Pags, Handel on the Law with Bill Handel and Somewhere in Time with Art Bell, as well as repeats of weekday shows. World and national news is supplied by Fox News Radio. ==HistoryEarly Years=== WIBX first signed on the air December 5, 1925. The station was originally owned by Grid Leak, Inc., a local radio dealer. The company put the station on the air to provide programming for customers who bought radios. WIBX's facilities were housed at the store. The following April, Grid Leak transferred the station to a subsidiary, WIBX, Inc., and a month later a new studios were opened at the Hotel Utica. Initially operating at 1460 kilocycles, WIBX moved to 1280 kHz in late 1926, and then to 1260 kHz in April 1927. Among Central New York radio stations, only WSYR is older, going on the air in 1922. The Boston Store acquired the station in early 1928, a move intended to keep WIBX in Utica. That April, the station was taken over by John C. Drummond. The Federal Radio Commission moved WIBX to 1200 kHz on November 11. On December 1, the station moved its studios to the First National Bank Building. The Buffalo Broadcasting Corporation, which operated several stations in Buffalo, New York, including WGR, WKBW, and WMAK, acquired WIBX in August 1929. In March 1931, the station was sold to a partnership of Percy B. Brown and Scott Howe Bowen. Bowen soon acquired Brown's stake; his family would maintain ownership for nearly five decades. ===CBS Affiliation=== On October 14, 1934, WIBX became a network affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Through the Golden Age of Radio, the station carried the CBS network's line up of dramas, comedies, soap operas, game shows, sports and big band remotes, as well as newscasts. WIBX remained a CBS Radio Network affiliate for 76 years. ===Power Increase=== The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) moved WIBX to 1230 kHz on March 29, 1941. However, on this frequency, the station remained at low-power, 250 watts, as had been the case at 1200 kHz). That meant it could not be easily heard in nearby Rome at night, leading the Rome Sentinel to apply for a 5,000-watt station serving both cities in 1946. Afraid that the new station, which eventually became WRUN, would prove more attractive for CBS, WIBX sought to upgrade to its own 5,000-watt facility. On May 2, 1947, the Federal Communications Commission granted WIBX a move to 950 kHz from a transmitter site in Whitesboro, New York, with the new facility going on the air in early 1948. The WIBX studios would relocate to Whitesboro as well in the early 1960s. An FM sister station at 98.7, WIBQ (now WLZW), was added January 1, 1974. An earlier WIBX-FM at 96.9 FM first signed on in October 1946, but left the air during the early 1950s, when few people owned FM radios. ===Sportswatch=== WIBX included in its line up the sports program Sportswatch, which debuted in the 1950s and included among its numerous hosts Bill O'Donnell, Lee \\"Hacksaw\\" Hamilton, Tim Roye, Bob Papa, Jim Jackson, and Mike Haynes. Sportswatch ended its run in January 2013.Former WIBX hosts offer Sportswatch postmortems. CNYRadio.com.

Soon afterward, the station's longstanding full service middle of the road format began evolving away from music in favor of increased news, talk, and sports programming. After REBS, Inc. acquired WIBX in 1985, music programming was dropped entirely, outside of the station's Sunday morning Polish language program, Polonaise. Maritime Broadcasting bought the station in 1988. The station was then sold to 950 Communications Corporation in 1992, to Forever Broadcasting in 1996, and to Regent Communications (the predecessor to Townsquare Media) in 1999. Regent moved its Utica-area stations to studios in Marcy, New York, in 2003. WIBX ended its long affiliation with CBS on February 28, 2011, when it joined Fox News Radio. Prior to the affiliation change, WIBX was the only station, radio or television, to carry CBS content in the Mohawk Valley, since the Utica area had no CBS television affiliate at the time, and had to pick up CBS programming from either Syracuse or Schenectady. CBS returned to the Utica area November 22, 2015 when NBC affiliate WKTV affiliated its second digital subchannel with CBS television. In 2015, WIBX reached an agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Mission Broadcasting, whose stations are managed by Nexstar under shared services and local marketing agreements, to share programming, allowing Nexstar-owned Channel 33 WFXV to simulcast WIBX's morning show starring Bill Keeler, while WIBX began simulcasting Mission-owned WUTR Channel 20's 6 p.m. newscast. Citing closed-captioning expenses, WFXV dropped the simulcast of Keeler's show on January 4, 2016, but reinstated it May 9, 2016.http://wibx950.com/keeler-show-notes-for-monday- january-4th-2016/http://wibx950.com/keeler-show-to-be-simulcast-daily-on-wfxv- fox-33-tv/ ==Charitable Broadcasts== The station conducts a radiothon for the American Heart Association every March. It was first held in 1971 in memory of Ralph Allinger, a WIBX staffer who died of a heart attack. In subsequent years, the American Heart Association has also held additional fundraisers in the Mohawk Valley, including a run and walk, to supplement the radiothon. ==ReferencesScott Howe Bowen papers at the University of Maryland Libraries, details information about one of the earliest owners of the radio station from 1928-1940 Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States IBX Category:Radio stations established in 1925 Category:Townsquare Media radio stations ","title":"WIBX"},{"id":"9104050","text":"The SsangYong Actyon is a compact SUV built by the South Korean automobile manufacturer SsangYong Motor from 2005 to 2011 for the first generation, and 2012 to present for the second. It was available either as an SUV (Actyon) or as a pick-up truck (Actyon Sports). They replaced the SsangYong Musso and Musso Sports. The name is an amalgam of the words \\"action\\" and \\"young\\". == Overview == Both are available 2WD or 4WD systems and a third generation common rail VGT turbo diesel engine, or one 2.3 litre overhead cam four cylinder petrol engine. Replacing the original Musso, the Actyon Sports has a wider track, increased load capacity and a more fuel efficient European designed engine. The vehicle also comes with double wishbone front suspension and a five-link rear end as well as the availability of ESP (Electronic Stability Program) is a big offering from the South Korean manufacturer. Along with ESP, the Actyon comes with hill descent control as standard (on some models). The diesel engine sourced from Europe produces of power at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2700 rpm. The 2.3 litre petrol engine produces around at 5500 rpm ad at 4500 rpm. Other optional equipment includes keyless entry, dual airbags, speed sensitive central locking, engine immobilizer and alarm, electric windows, child safety door locks and tray liner. Initially offered with a four speed automatic, the Actyon was later upgraded with a six speed automatic transmission sourced from Australian company Drivetrain Systems International. For a few years, there was no Australian importer for SsangYong so the supply contract for the automatic transmissions disappeared, and Drivetrain Systems International went into receivership, eventually being bought out by conglomerate Geely, where then all manufacturing was moved to China. After a number of issues with the six speed automatic transmissions, SsangYong reverted to a five speed automatic transmission for automatic Actyon Sports. In 2008, Phoenix Motorcars in Ontario, California introduced the Phoenix SUV and Phoenix SUT for fleet managers. These two electric powered vehicles were based on the design of the SsangYong Actyon SUV and SUT. In June 2010, the Actyon received a facelift. === Actyon Sports === A year into Actyon production, a pickup variant was announced, called the Actyon Sports. This variant outlasted its namesake, in production until 2018 with the release of the new Musso pickup. == Redesign == In 2012, SsangYong launched an updated version of the Actyon Sports pickup, which in the market of Korea is called Korando Sports, which is essentially a production version of the SUT‚Äì1 Concept Car, as seen in the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. They also launched a facelifted the SsangYong Actyon SUV called the SsangYong Nomad in 2014, but it was mainly sold in Kazakhstan until 2017. == Motorsport == SsangYong New Zealand launched an Actyon Racing series in 2014. The series features a field of slightly modified Actyons with identical drive trains, allowing driver ability to determine race outcomes. The racing Actyons feature a 2.3 litre petrol engine by Mercedes-Benz routed through a four speed sequential gearbox, locally sourced and an open differential. The suspension is lowered to improve handling and a full protective cage and harnesses are installed. == Gallery == File:2007 SsangYong Actyon (C100) A230 wagon (2015-07-03) 02.jpg  Pre facelift SsangYong Actyon File:2007 SsangYong Actyon (C100) A230 wagon (2015-07-03) 01.jpg  Pre facelift Ssangyong Actyon File:2008 SsangYong Actyon Sports (Q100 MY08) Tradie 4WD utility (22354915055).jpg  Pre facelift SsangYong Actyon Sports File:2008 SsangYong Actyon Sports (Q100 MY08) Tradie 4WD utility (22365601541).jpg  Pre facelift SsangYong Actyon Sports File:2012 Ssangyong Actyons Sports D200S (Stockholm).jpg  Facelift SsangYong Actyon Sports File:2012 Ssangyong Actyons Sports D200S rear.jpg  Facelift SsangYong Actyon Sports File:2017 SsangYong Musso EX Automatic 2.2.jpg Facelift Ssangyong Musso File:SsangYong Actyon facelift 02 Auto China 2014-04-23.jpg  Facelift Ssangyong Actyon == References == == External links == * Actyon Category:Pickup trucks Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Compact sport utility vehicles Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles Category:Sport utility trucks Category:Cars introduced in 2005 Category:2010s cars ","title":"SsangYong Actyon"},{"id":"9104055","text":"The 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup was a football cup competition held between clubs in England and Italy won by Swindon Town. It was the inaugural Anglo- Italian League Cup competition. ==Background== The origin of the Anglo-Italian League Cup (also known as the Anglo-Italian Cup Winners' Cup and billed on the match programme as the International League Cup Winners' Cup) was to reward Swindon Town with European football in lieu of their ineligibility for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup following their victory in the 1968‚Äì69 League Cup, beating Arsenal in the final. The Football League Cup had been changed in 1967 so the winner would be awarded a place in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup; however, teams outside the First Division were not permitted in the competition. Queens Park Rangers won that year's final but were omitted from the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup as they were in the Third Division. When Swindon, another third division club, won the League Cup two years later the Anglo-Italian League Cup was organised as a way of compensating them for the ruling that prevented them competing in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The competition consisted of a single two-legged match against the Italian team A.S. Roma who had won the Coppa Italia that season. ==The final== The final was played over two legs, with A.S. Roma drawn to host the first game in Rome. The second leg was played in England. ===1st leg=== { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"A.S.

The first half was characterised by the many attempts on goal by Roma's centre-forward Enzo saved by Swindon goalkeeper Downsborough. In the 12th minute Roma were denied a penalty. Peiro had fed a pass through to Cappellini and, as the inside-right cut into the penalty area, he appeared to be sent full-length by a tackle from Harland. Instead of the expected penalty, English referee Kevin Howley gave Swindon a free-kick. Shortly before half-time, Elvio Salvori, the Roma half back, dived over the outstretched leg of Roger Smart. A penalty was awarded, which Fabio Enzo converted. Just two minutes later, the half-time whistle sounded. > Then, as Salvori broke into the penalty area, he literally threw himself > over the outstretched leg of Smart. Much to the dismay of the Town players, > the referee immediately awarded a penalty from which Enzo scored. The second half was more evenly contested, and Swindon equalised through Peter Noble who sliced a chipped free-kick from John Smith just out of the grasp of the Roma goalkeeper, Alberto Ginulfi. Roma responded with a period of concerted attack and were rewarded when Renato Cappellini headed home a cross from a corner, which proved to be the winner. Swindon pressurised the Italian defence for the final 10 minutes of the game but could not equalise, A.S. Roma won 2‚Äì1. ===2nd leg=== { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"SWINDON TOWN: - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK   Peter Downsborough - RB Rod Thomas - LB John Trollope - MF Joe Butler - CB Mick Blick - CB Stan Harland - FW Arthur Horsfield - MF Roger Smart - MF John Smith - FW Peter Noble - FW Don Rogers - colspan=3Substitutes: - None - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=4 Fred Ford } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"4\\"A.S.

It took Swindon five minutes to pull level on aggregate, when Arthur Horsfield volleyed home a cross from John Smith. The game remained at 1‚Äì0 until the 70th minute, when Horsfield added his second and Don Rogers scored the third two minutes later. With Roma pushing forward to get back into the game, Horsfield completed his hat-trick in the 89th minute ‚Äì meaning Swindon Town had won 4‚Äì0 on the night, and 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. The gate receipts were reported as being ¬£8794.19s, equivalent to around ¬£ in . ==Post game== Impressed with the competition and spirit of both fans and clubs, the Italian FA organised another Anglo-Italian competition for later the same season. This was to be the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup, a competition that Swindon Town won. A.S. Roma were later Anglo-Italian Cup champions in 1972. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Anglo-Italian League Cup 1969 at RSSSF * Anglo-Italian League Cup Winners 1969/1970 ‚Äì swindon-town-fc.co.uk Category:Swindon Town F.C. matches Category:A.S.

He was the ninth Archbishop of St. Louis from 2009 to 2020. He previously served as Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis (1983‚Äì1994), Bishop of Sioux Falls (1995‚Äì2004), and Bishop of Saginaw (2004-2009). ==Early life and ministry== Robert Carlson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Robert and Jeanne Carlson. His father was serving in the U.S. Navy on a destroyer in Guam when his son was born, and later worked as a Prudential insurance salesman for 43 years. The eldest of five children, Carlson has four younger sisters, two of whom died in childhood. During high school, he studied under the Christian Brothers and played football. He studied at St. Paul Seminary, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1966. Carlson‚Äôs father Robert Sr. was adopted by a Swedish Lutheran father. Carlson was ordained to the priesthood on May 23, 1970. He earned a Master's in Divinity from St. Paul Seminary in 1976, and a Licentiate of Canon Law from the Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in 1979. He served as a pastor, a judge on the archdiocesan tribunal, director of the Office of Vocations, and chancellor of the curia in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. He also served at the University of St. Thomas, where he was a chaplain to the hockey team. ==Episcopal careerAuxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis=== On November 19, 1983, Pope John Paul II appointed Carlson as Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Titular Bishop of Avioccala. He received his episcopal consecration on January 11, 1984, from Archbishop John Roach, with Bishops John Kinney and Paul Dudley serving as co- consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: Ante Crucem Nihil Defensionis, that is, \\"Before the Cross There is No Defense.\\" In 1984, Carlson was told of an accusation against a parish priest, the Rev. Thomas Adamson. Adamson had already spent two weeks in an inpatient clinic after being accused of abuse four years earlier. Carlson confronted Adamson, who admitted committing sexual abuse against children and \\"agreed that it probably would be first-degree criminal sexual contact\\". In a memo to Archbishop Roach, Carlson recommended \\"given the seriousness of our exposure that the Archdiocese posture itself in such a way that any publicity will be minimized\\". Adamson later admitted to sexually abusing children in 10 of the 13 parishes to which he was assigned. When the case became public, Carlson defended his earlier actions, stating, \\"My job was to investigate and report back to the archbishop what I found out, and that's exactly what I did.\\" ===Bishop of Sioux Falls=== On January 13, 1994, Pope John Paul II named Carlson coadjutor bishop of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, succeeding Paul Dudley as the seventh Bishop of Sioux Falls upon the latter's retirement on March 21, 1995. He served as chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Vocations from 1992 to 1994, and of the Subcommittee on Youth from 1993 to 1996. While serving in Sioux Falls, Carlson offered to allow South Dakota's attorney general to inspect the diocese's files as part of his effort to demonstrate his open approach to sexual abuse on the part of priests. He required diocesan employees and priests transferring into his diocese to undergo thorough background checks. ===Bishop of Saginaw=== Carlson was appointed the fifth Bishop of Saginaw, Michigan, on December 29, 2004, in one of the last episcopal appointments to the American Catholic Church made by Pope John Paul II. Succeeding the late Bishop Kenneth Untener, he was installed at St. Mary's Cathedral on February 24, 2005. He later said that upon arriving he reviewed the file of every priest in the diocese as a proactive measure against sexual abuse on the part of priests. During his tenure in Saginaw, Carlson focused on priestly vocations, Catholic schools, service to the poor, stewardship, and evangelization. He also published six pastoral letters; created the Saginaw Area Catholic Schools system; and established two charities, the Bishop's Charity Golf Classic and the Bishop's Charity Ball. In demonstration of his dedication to vocations, Carlson filled the role of diocesan vocations director himself. In 2005 the number of seminarians increased from 4 to 12, and in 2006 the number of seminarians again increased to 19. In August 2006, the first permanent deacon in 25 years was ordained for the diocese.Treadwell, M. (August 15, 2006) \\"Deacon Ordination First in 25 Years\\", Diocese of Saginaw Press Release. In June 2007, two men were ordained to the priesthood and five to the transitional diaconate. ===Archbishop of St. Louis=== Pope Benedict XVI named Carlson the ninth Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri, on April 21, 2009. He replaced Archbishop Raymond Burke, who was appointed Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura in the Roman Curia in June 2008. As Archbishop, Carlson was the spiritual leader of 566,000 Catholics in eastern Missouri. He received the pallium from The Pope on June 29, 2009, in a ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica.\\"Reception of the Pallium ‚Äì Archbishop Robert J. Carlson\\", St. Louis Review Soon after Carlson's arrival, the pastor of a St. Louis parish was arrested and suspended from priestly duties for alleged sexual improprieties with minors. Carlson visited and spoke to the parish soon afterward at one of their Masses and notified the previous parishes where the priest had served of the allegations. He was praised for his response. In 2005, Carlson's predecessor Burke had excommunicated parish priest Rev. Marek Bozek and the lay board of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church as part of a decades-long dispute over the control over parish property, the appointment of a Polish or Polish- speaking pastor to replace Bozek, Bozek's status and compensation, and whom to recognize as a parishioner or board member. Carlson, after trying to reconcile with the board and parishioners, concluded an agreement in which the archdiocese surrendered its property claims and St. Stanislaus agreed not to claim any affiliation with the Roman Catholic church. In response to the grand jury report concerning clerical sexual abuse in Pennsylvania, Archbishop Carlson invited the Missouri attorney general's office to conduct an inspection of the archdiocesan files and to produce a report on clerical abuse in the state. Pope Francis accepted his resignation on June 10, 2020 and named Mitchell T. Rozanski as his successor. ==Views== Carlson is considered theologically conservative. His appointment follows a pattern observed by John Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, of former Pope Benedict choosing prelates \\"who are basically conservative in both their politics and their theology, but also upbeat, pastoral figures given to dialogue.\\" ===Pro-abortion rights politicians=== Regarding withholding Holy Communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, and who persist in doing so even after consultation with their bishop, Carlson has stressed the need for personal dialogue with them but also affirmed the validity of denying Holy Communion to such individuals as he said that \\"If I were to enter into dialogue with somebody, and after they reflect on the discussion and that person persisted, it could come to that point. ...Archbishop Burke, who is on the Supreme Apostolic Signatura, has combined in an interesting way, and I think he does it correctly. And he's not just speaking anymore as the Archbishop of St. Louis, he is the prefect of the Signatura. It appears that's the direction the church consensus is moving towards. ... Could we get into that situation? Yes. But at least in my own time in St. Louis, I'd like to have a crack at the dialogue first.\\" During his tenure, Carlson was a frequent critic of U.S. Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), who held certain positions contrary to Catholic teachings. In 1997, before a Senate vote on partial-birth abortion legislation, Carlson denounced a compromise proposed by Daschle that would ban the procedure but allow exemptions for women claiming mental or physical health reasons, calling the proposition a \\"smokescreen\\" designed to \\"provide cover for pro-abortion senators and President Clinton, who wanted to avoid a veto confrontation.\\" In response, Daschle described the Bishops as being \\"more identified with the radical right than with thoughtful religious leadership.\\" In 2003, Carlson privately urged Daschle to no longer identify himself as a Catholic because of his support for abortion. Daschle refused to disclose any details of his communication with Carlson, saying, \\"I am not going to participate in a debate that is intended to politicize anyone's religious beliefs...\\" The Bishop later added, \\"I would never break off dialogue or a pastoral relationship with anyone.\\" During the 2008 presidential election, Carlson stated, \\"A Catholic can, in good conscience, vote for a pro-choice candidate only if other issues outweigh this one in number and in kind.\\" The day following Barack Obama's victory, he said, \\"This election has shown that any child who is born in America has the opportunity to ascend to the highest political office in the land. We must continue to work and pray tirelessly for the day when every child who is conceived will have the right to live.\\" On May 15, 2009, Carlson expressed his disappointment over the University of Notre Dame's decision to have President Obama deliver its commencement speech and receive an honorary degree, and said, \\"Notre Dame has to figure out who they are‚Äîare they of the culture, or are they of the Church?\\" ===Girl Scouts === In February 2016, Carlson encouraged pastors to review their relationship with Girl Scouts of the USA, and their parent organization World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), due to \\"a troubling pattern of behavior\\" in regards to Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocates. ==Cancer== Carlson survived stage-four bladder cancer in the 1990s, having once been told by his doctor to arrange his financial affairs in order to prepare for an imminent death. He has undergone a total of seven cancer-related procedures, and partly credited a trip to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima in Portugal for his recovery. ==Other Appointments== Carlson serves as: * Chairman of the USCCB Committee on Clergy, Religious, and Vocations * Episcopal Advisor for the Cursillo Movement, Region VI * Chairman of the USCCB Committee for Catholic Charismatic Renewal * Member of the Canon Law Society of America * Board member for the Catholic Mutual Relief Society in Omaha, Nebraska * Member of the USCCB Subcommittee on Youth and Young Adults * Board member for the International Dominican Foundation * Board member for St. John Vianney Theological Seminary in Denver, Colorado * President of the Bishop's Advisory Board at the Institute of Priestly Formation in Omaha * Past President and Founder of the Catholic Youth Foundation USA (originally the National Foundation for Catholic Youth Ministry) * Episcopal Board Member for NET Ministries USA NET ==Recent publications== * The Liberating Power of this Sacrament, Instruction on the Sacrament of Penance, Lent 2009 * Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, Pastoral Letter on Peace, December 12, 2008 * 'Our witness must grow stronger', Statement on the results of the Nov 4 General Election, November 5, 2008 * Preparing for the Nov 4 General Election, On Abortion, Catholic Voters, and Proposal 2, October 28, 2008 * Body and Soul, A reflection for couples called to the vocation of marriage on the 40th anniversary of Humanae Vitae, July 25, 2008 * Jesus Christ, the Divine Physician, Pastoral Letter on Penance, January 25, 2008 * Pastoral Letter on Evangelization, January 6, 2008 ==References== ==External links== * Archdiocese of Saint Louis * Diocese of Saginaw * Bishop Carlson, \\"Promoting the Culture of Life\\" from Michigan Right to Life News * Diocese of Saginaw Vocations page * Article about Saginaw Vocations * Saginaw Serra Club website * Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity * Bishop Carlson and Tom Daschle * St. Louis Archbishop Robert Carlson Claims He Wasn't Sure Whether Sex Abuse Was A Crime Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:University of St. Thomas (Minnesota) alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Sioux Falls Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Saginaw Category:Archbishops of St. Louis Category:Clergy from Minneapolis Category:People from Saginaw, Michigan Category:Cancer survivors Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:American Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Catholic University of America School of Canon Law alumni ","title":"Robert James Carlson"},{"id":"9104070","text":"Charles Everett Johnson (born January 3, 1972) is a former professional American football player who was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round (17th overall) of the 1994 NFL Draft.

The arcade game comes in two types of cabinets, one for four players and one for two players. The game possesses many similarities to Namco's Time Crisis series, not the least of which is the ability of players to take cover at will. Each player character comes equipped with a large, portable metal shield that can block incoming projectiles. Unlike the Time Crisis games, however, this shield is not activated by a foot pedal, but rather by pointing the gun outside the screen (like many classic first-person rail shooters, shooting off-screen also reloads the player's weapon). The game also features a mechanic similar to Time Crisis's \\"Crisis Sighting,\\" where most enemy projectiles miss the player harmlessly, but those that are an immediate threat slow down and are much larger than normal, giving the player a small window to react. Though the game is cooperative, there are a few light competitive elements. For one, players start at a rank of Private Second Class and are allowed to ascend in ranks (all the way to Field Marshal) at the end of each mission depending on how well they play. The player with the highest rank (or score, if the ranks are equal) is called the \\"leader\\" and is awarded an extra life. Each player takes control of a soldier involved in a massive conflict against an army of undead equipped with modern weaponry. The game features enemies such as rifle-toting skeletons, tanks, jets, and helicopters. Weapons include a semi-automatic rifle, which the player starts with, a machine gun, and a rocket launcher. Konami released a follow-up to the game, Wartran Troopers in 2004. ==External links== * Category:2003 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Light gun games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Konami games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Konami arcade games ","title":"World Combat"},{"id":"9104162","text":"The Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District provides k-12 public education to the children of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and Ketchikan, Alaska.

At 19, Klein worked as a joiner at the time of the Nazi German invasion of Poland in World War II, when he was taken to the Maidanek concentration camp along with his father. His mother and five younger siblings were sent to the extermination camp of Treblinka.Miriam Jordan (11 June 2002). \\"Down Market: A Retailer in Brazil Has Become Rich By Courting Poor --- Payments of $14 a Month Add Up for Samuel Klein, Sao Paulo's Sam Walton\\", Wall Street Journal (Eastern edition; pg.

He escaped from the soldiers on 22 July 1944; in his own words, \\"I didn't know where I was going, but I was certain to get far from the group.\\" He spent the night in the fields, where some Christian Poles, also fugitives, helped him flee.

Klein lived in Munich, West Germany, until 1951, where he met Chana, his future wife. Some of Klein's family live in the Boston metropolitan area including his great-nephew, Victor Asher Greenstein, who graduated with an MBA from Dartmouth College, Tuck School of Business and is currently a prominent accountant with KPMG, LLP. ===Brazil and Casas Bahia=== Klein's father went to Brazil, together with his sister Esther. He himself wanted to emigrate to the United States, but the immigration quota was full. So he joined his father and sister, making his way to Brazil via Bolivia, and settled with his family in S√£o Caetano do Sul in greater S√£o Paulo.

The systematic murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by Germans, also part of his personal history and experience, weighed heavily on his mind, and led him to be at the forefront of the establishment and strengthening of many Jewish organizations in S√£o Paulo where he lived. He was the largest annual donor to Chabad/Lubavitch's boys' school and Lubavitch Yeshiva (estimated at ~$500,000 per year) in the Bom Retiro neighborhood. In 2007 he purchased the large property for the two schools, which had been previously paying rent. He is also a major donor to the Renaissance School (Col√©gio Renascen√ßa) in Bom Retiro. In recent years he gave in excess of $20 million to a wider range of those in need both in S√£o Paulo and abroad. This included assisting young people in S√£o Paulo with grants to set up small businesses. ==References== ==Further reading== * Elias Awad. (2005, 2nd ed).

The tympanum is an external hearing structure in animals such as mammals, birds, some reptiles, some amphibians and some insects. Using sound, vertebrates and many insects are capable of sensing their prey, identifying and locating their predators, warning other individuals, and locating potential mates and rivals by hearing the intentional or unintentional sounds they make. In general, any animal that reacts to sounds or communicates by means of sound, needs to have an auditory mechanism. This typically consists of a membrane capable of vibration known as the tympanum, an air-filled chamber and sensory organs to detect the auditory stimuli. ==Anurans== In frogs and toads, the tympanum is a large external oval shape membrane made up of nonglandular skin. It is located just behind the eye. It does not process sound waves; it simply transmits them to the inner parts of the amphibian's ear, which is protected from the entry of water and other foreign objects. A frog's ear drum works in very much the same way as does a human ear drum. It is a membrane that is stretched across a ring of cartilage like a snare drum that vibrates. Crossing the middle ear chamber there is an ossicle called the columella that is connected to the tympanum, and another ossicle, the operculum, that connects this to the oval membrane. This separates the middle ear from the inner ear; and its movements are reflected in vibrations in the fluid in the inner ear; these vibrations cause microscopic hairs to move, which send signals to the frog's brain. A frog's lungs are also involved in the reception of sound, although they are less sensitive than the frog's ear drums. ==See also== * Frog * Eardrum * Tympanal organ in insects ==References== Category:Amphibian anatomy Category:Auditory system Category:Sensory organs ","title":"Tympanum (anatomy)"},{"id":"9104209","text":"The Chronicle of Moses (Hebrew: ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô ◊î◊ô◊û◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊û◊©◊î) is one of the smaller midrashim.

Though the screenplay was written by Dhruva Chatterjee, parts were later rewritten, wherein Manoj Kumar took an active role. Music by Madan Mohan was the asset of this movie.

He sees a woman standing in the road and gives her a lift. She introduces herself as No one. As soon as she steps in the car (Austin Cambridge A55 Mark II), the wipers eerily stop working. He's even more spooked when the lady shows him the way when it isn't visible and guides him outside a cemetery. On reaching the cemetery, the gates open automatically and he hears someone sing the words \\"Naina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\\". Dr. Anand is about to inherit a large fortune from a distant relative under the condition that he is perfectly mentally stable‚Äîotherwise, he would not inherit the property as there had already been cases of mental instability in his family in the past. His colleague, Dr. Lata loves Dr. Anand, but he already has a girlfriend, Seema. The mystery unfolds when Seema is killed by a cyanide injection and the suspects are Dr. Lata and her father, Dr. Singh, the head doctor of the hospital in which Anand and Lata work. On a stormy night, Anand is called to a dilapidated mansion on an emergency case. There, he comes to know that the patient has already died. He is surprised to see that the patient is the same girl. Some policemen tell him that the place has been deserted for a while and that it is rumored to be haunted. The policemen inform him that what he saw in the mansion happened years ago and many a doctor has registered similar cases with the police on rainy nights. On another occasion, he sees a newspaper which says that same girl died in a rail accident. Anand is very unhappy after his girlfriend's demise, but his marriage is fixed to a girl named by Sandhya, Anand's mother has never even seen but was recommended by her sister. On the wedding night, Anand is shocked to see that she is like the same girl. He starts avoiding her. One day, he sees that she has painted the same bungalow in which he was called on that rainy night. Just after that, he hears her singing a part of \\"Naina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\\". Another evening, he sees an unmanned boat sailing in the lake and hears another part of \\"Naina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\\". Yet another night, the Same Girl reaches Anand's hospital and tries to impress him with her beauty and singing. He gets impressed and they sit in the car, where he gets d√©j√† vu as again the wipers stop working and she can clearly see the way on the stormy and foggy night. He takes her to the bungalow and to the room where he had seen her dead and she disappears. When he reaches home, she is waiting for him and his mother says that she never left the house. Anand is finally successful in persuading his mother to let Sandhya go back to her home by train. The next day, he comes to know that the train got into an accident, but he saw her on the terrace that same night. All these things take a toll on his mental health and he is advised to take some rest in Shimla. There, he meets a monk on a hilltop who tells him that 100 years ago at this very spot, a boy and a girl were romancing when the girl fell and died. Since then, her spirit has been roaming, waiting for her lover to return, who has been reincarnated in Anand's form. Anand then sees Sandhya far down the hillside and she sings the last part of \\"Naina Barse Rimjhim Rimjhim\\". Persuaded, Anand jumps but is saved by Lata. Later, when Anand sees Sandhya trying to lure him out, he follows her to the same old bungalow, where he sees Sandhya on the stairway in one moment and then impossibly beside him in another. She lures him to the roof, where suddenly he sees a duplicate of Sandhya. The duplicate shouts that she is the real Sandhya but she is fake and taken away. Strengthened by this sudden revelation, Anand realizes this woman is not a ghost and confronts her, but she accidentally falls down and dies. Then comes Ramesh, Anand's cousin. The climax of the movie comes here as Ramesh reveals that this was his plan so that Anand is termed as mentally unstable and that his entire inheritance would pass to the next cousin i.e., Ramesh. A duel follows and the police arrive. The other woman was Sandhya's twin, of whom Sandhya didn't know. Sandhya's parents had separated them years ago when her mother took away the other girl. Her mother died, and she was forced to adopt unfair means for her living. Her father came to know about her but he couldn't tell Sandhya about her twin sister. But somehow Ramesh got to know about this twin sister and he started his brilliant planning. The \\"Sandhya\\" who had lured him in the hospital was this other girl. This explains Sandhya's presence at 2 places at the same time. Hence, the mystery is solved and at the end of the film Sandhya and Anand hug. ==Cast== *Sadhana as Sandhya / Sandhya's twin sister *Manoj Kumar as Dr. Anand *Helen as Seema, Anand's girlfriend * Ratnamala as Dr.Anand's mother *Prem Chopra as Dr. Ramesh, Anand's distant cousin. *Parveen Choudhary as Dr. Lata, a coworker of Anand. *K.

The Parker, later Parker-a-Morley-Long Baronetcy, of Arwaton in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 16 July 1661 for Philip Parker, Member of Parliament for Harwich and Sandwich. His grandson, the third Baronet, also represented Harwich in the House of Commons. He assumed the additional surnames of a-Morley-Long. The title became extinct on his death in 1741.

On his death in 1697 the baronetcy descended by special remainder to his nephew, Henry Parker, then of Honington Hall near Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, Member of Parliament for Evesham and Aylesbury. He married Margaret, daughter and heir of Alexander Hyde, Bishop of Salisbury, first cousin of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. The most famous member of the family was the naval commander Sir Hyde Parker, the fifth Baronet. His second son was Admiral Sir Hyde Parker. He was the father of the naval commander Admiral Hyde Parker and of John Boteler Parker, a Major-General in the British Army. The family seat is Melford Hall, Long Melford, Suffolk. The Parker Baronetcy, of Bassingbourn in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 13 January 1783 for Sir Peter Parker, also an eminent naval officer, though unrelated to the Parker family of Melford Hall. He was known for his service in the American Revolution. His grandson, Charles, the fifth Baronet, was also an Admiral in the Royal Navy. The title became extinct on his death in 1869. The Parker Baronetcy, of Harburn in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 24 July 1797 for William Parker for his service at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Though unrelated to the previous two, he also enjoyed a long naval career, retiring as a Vice-Admiral. The baronetcy became extinct on the death of the sixth Baronet in 1903. The Parker Baronetcy, of Shenstone Lodge in the County of Stafford, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 18 December 1844 for Sir William Parker, who like his distant relative the Earl of Macclesfield, was a descendant of the Parker family of Park Hall, Claverswall, Staffordshire Parker Pedigree from Stirnet but unrelated to the other baronets. He, too, was a naval officer, and commanded British naval forces in China in the First Opium War. The third Baronet, William, was an Olympic medallist. George Parker, second son of the first Baronet, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. The Right Honourable Sir Thomas Parker, grandfather of the first Baronet, was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The Parker Baronetcy, of Carlton House Terrace in the County of London, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 21 June 1915 for Gilbert Parker, a Member of Parliament and novelist. The title became extinct upon his death in 1932. ==Parker baronets, of Arwaton (1661)== *Sir Philip Parker, 1st Baronet (‚Äì1690) *Sir Philip Parker, 2nd Baronet (c. 1650‚Äìc. 1698).

The film had its world premiere in western France after the Allies had liberated those territories following the D-Day Invasion. The film is based on the 1927 novel An Unmarried Father by Floyd Dell and the 1928 play Little Accident by Dell and Thomas Mitchell, which had been previously filmed by Universal Pictures in 1930 as The Little Accident and in 1939 as Little Accident. ==Plot== Arriving in a small Illinois town by train, Casanova Brown is met by Madge Ferris and tells her not to bring up his trip to New York. Cas decides to ask Madge to marry him, even though her father J.J. warns him against it, saying Madge is nothing but trouble. Cas leaves town because of a letter from a Dr. Zernerke summoning him to Chicago, but promises to be back in time for the wedding. A baby girl is at the Chicago hospital and Cas is asked for an explanation. He tells of his New York experience with Isabel Drury, of how they fell in love and decided to wed, only to have Cas repeatedly upset Isabel's mother by insulting her belief in astrology, ignoring her warnings that their union would be cursed, then inadvertently burning down the Drurys' house. After the marriage is annulled, Cas thought it was over. But now there's a baby. Cas disguises himself as a doctor and kidnaps the kid. He then decides to adopt it, but in a hurry to prove he has a stable home life, he proposes to the first woman he sees, Monica, a hotel maid, that they get married immediately. Madge is left at the altar, Isabel comes back claiming it was just a prank she was playing to get even with Cas for leaving her, and it turns out Monica didn't get to marry him after all because they didn't have a proper license. Cas and Isabel decide to give it another try. ==Cast== * Gary Cooper as Casanova Brown * Teresa Wright as Isabel Drury * Frank Morgan as Mr. Ferris * Anita Louise as Madge Ferris * Edmund Breon as Mr. Drury (as Edmond Breon) * Patricia Collinge as Mrs. Drury * Jill Esmond as Dr. Zernerke * Mary Treen as Monica Case, the Maid * Emory Parnell as Frank, the Bell Captain * Isobel Elsom as Mrs. Ferris * Halliwell Hobbes as Charles, the Butler * Charles Cane as Hicks * Larry Olsen as Junior (as Larry Joe Olsen) * Irving Bacon as Hotel manager * Dorothy Tree as Nurse Clark * Grace Cunard as Relative at baby window ==Awards== The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: for Best Score (Arthur Lange), Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T.

The church was designed by architects and brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen and opened in 1969. Built directly into solid rock, it is also known as the Church of the Rock and Rock Church.\\"Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki\\", Retrieved 2012-09-05. ==History and architecture== Plans for the Temppeliaukio/Tempelplatsen (Temple square) began as early as the 1930s when a plot of land was selected for the building and a competition for the design was held. The plan by J. S. Siren, the winner of the second competition to design the architecture of the church, was interrupted in its early stages when World War II began in 1939. After the war, there was another architectural competition, subsequently won by Timo Suomalainen and Tuomo Suomalainen in 1961. For economic reasons, the suggested plan was scaled back and the interior space of the church then reduced to about one-quarter of its original plan. Construction finally began in February 1968, and the rock- temple was completed for consecration in September 1969. The interior was excavated and built directly out of solid rock and is bathed in natural light which enters through the skylight surrounding the center copper dome. The church is used frequently as a concert venue due to its excellent acoustics. The acoustic quality is created by the rough, virtually unworked rock surfaces. The iconic rock walls were not included in the original competition entry, even though the Suomalainen brothers had considered the idea, because they believed that it was too radical for the competition jury. But when conductor Paavo Berglund shared his knowledge of acoustics from some of the best music halls and the acoustical engineer Mauri Parjo gave requirements for the wall surfaces, the Suomalainen brothers discovered that they could fulfill all the requirements for the acoustics by leaving the rock walls exposed in the Church Hall. The Temppeliaukio church is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city; half a million people visit it annually. The stone- hewn church is located in the heart of Helsinki. Maintaining the original character of the square is the fundamental concept behind the building. The idiosyncratic choice of form has made it a favorite with professionals and aficionados of architecture. The church furnishings were designed by the architects. Organ builder Veikko Virtanen manufactured the church organ, which has 43 stops and 3001 pipes. There are no bells at the church; a recording of bells composed by Taneli Kuusisto is played via loudspeakers on the exterior wall. Before the construction of the church was even fully complete it made headlines when on the nights of 16 and 17 July 1968 a group of Christian students painted in large letters \\"BIAFRA\\" in several places on the exterior walls of the building to bring attention to the famine then going on in Biafra, which had declared independence from Nigeria in 1967. The argument of the students - then part of the '60s student revolutionary movement - was that the money spent on the new lavish church could be better spent on aid to Biafra and elsewhere in Africa.Lauri Malkavaara, \\"Punapappi ei unohda Biafraa\\", Helsingin Sanomien Kuukausiliite, 3/1993, p. 94. ==Gallery== File:Temppeliaukio Church 1.jpgThe copper dome roof of the church File:Temppeliaukio Church 2.jpgPipe organ from the balcony File:Eingang Felsenkirche Helsinki.jpgEntrance to the church File:11-07-29-helsinki-by- RalfR-030.jpgUnderside of the copper church roof File:Temppeliaukio Church Interior.JPGAn ice-age crevice used as the altarpiece File:Confirmation in Temppeliaukio Church.jpgA Lutheran confirmation service File:11-07-29-helsinki-by-RalfR-024.jpgDetail of the Entrance ==References== ==External links== *T√∂√∂l√∂ Congregation: the congregation that uses Temppeliaukio Church *Picture of Church and short history Category:Cave churches Category:Churches completed in 1969 Category:Lutheran churches in Helsinki ","title":"Temppeliaukio Church"},{"id":"9104287","text":"Costas Aslanidis () was a Lieutenant Colonel and the Secretary General of Athletics during the rule of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974. Aslanidis was a controversial figure throughout his tenure as Secretary General. On 30 January 1968, in a speech at the Alexandrion Melathron of Thessaloniki, he alleged that corruption was rife in Greek sports. He mentioned that Panathinaikos had paid off referees and linesmen, that Aegaleo FC defender, Tzekos Balarinis, had accepted a 7,000 drachmas bribe to throw his team's game and that Ethnikos' star goalkeeper, Kostas Vallianos, had also accepted bribes to throw his team's games. Aslanidis went further and blasted PAOK forward, Giorgos Koudas, for wanting to leave his team for Olympiakos. Aslanidis imposed complex rules for transfers in the Greek League: No player could transfer within his own division and no player could transfer to a higher division. However, Aslanidis made exceptions to his own rules, most noteworthy of which was the transfer of Aspida Xanthi forward, Antonis Antoniadis, to Panathinaikos. Aslanidis was instrumental in having the Champions of Cyprus play in the Greek Alpha Ethniki between the years 1968 and 1974. Olympiakos Nicosia FC were the first champions to participate and APOEL the last. The latter club was the only Cypriot team not to be relegated. Throughout his tenure Aslanidis insisted that athletes be well-groomed and clean-shaven. Aslanidis fled to Italy following the collapse of the Junta in 1974 and then moved to Brazil. Later, he returned to Greece where he died. ==References== Category:Hellenic Army officers Category:Leaders of the Greek junta ","title":"Costas Aslanidis"},{"id":"9104309","text":"El Camino Fundamental High School is a public high school in Sacramento, California in the San Juan Unified School District. Built in 1950 as El Camino High School, \\"Fundamental\\" was added to the name in the late 1970s to signify the school's intention to focus upon basic (fundamental) characteristics of successful schools, in particular a return to a strong disciplinary emphasis, a stripped-down college preparatory curriculum, and a contract-supported, enroll-through-application-only process. Academically, as measured by their Academic Performance Index, El Camino finally broke the important \\"800\\" barrier in 2009 after two years of changes implemented by its former principal, Mike Stockdale. El Camino has continually met the requirements of the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) outlined under No Child Left Behind mandates, since their inception. El Camino has, for over 20 years, participated with the state's \\"California Partnership Academy\\" program through the Eagle Polytechnic Institute (EPI) which focuses on engineering and manufacturing. ==Curriculum== The school offers Advanced Placement courses in Chemistry, English, Government, Psychology, Physics, Biology, Environmental Science, Calculus, Statistics, French, Spanish, and History. ==El Camino Band== El Camino Fundamental High School has four academic bands and one Pep Band. All four bands are under the leadership of Band Director Kevin Glaser, who has been teaching at the school since 1994, was a News 10 KXTV Teacher of the Month in 2007, and has made the EC (El Camino) band program what it is today. ==El Camino Choir== Choral Director David Vanderbout, a 2005 graduate of El Camino High School, has led the school's choirs since 2012. He leads a beginning choir, and intermediate choir, and an advanced Jazz choir. ==El Camino Theatre== El Camino Fundamental High School offers two theatrical classes, Beginning, and Advanced Drama. The program has also put on 3 productions every year while offering students the option of being a part of the cast or crew. For the past 5 years, the program has been run under the supervision of Edward Santillanes, who recently retired at the end of the 2018 school year. Under Mr. Santiallnes' direction the El Camino Drama department has put on multiple successful shows and musicals, recently including, Fiddler on the Roof (2016), Blythe Spirit (2016), The Sound of Music (2017), Plaza Suite (2017), Nice Work If You Can Get It (2018), Suite Surrender (2018), and The Wizard of Oz (2019). In recent years the program has received multiple awards from the San Juan Theatre Festival, including Gold and Bronze in an Original Scene, (2017), Bronze in Female Monolouge (2017), Silver in an Original Scene (2018) and Gold in a Female Monolouge (2018). Through his dedication and love for the performing arts and for his students, Mr. Santiallnes has made El Camino's Theatre Program one of the best in the district. The program is currently ran by Mr. Christopher Travlos. ==EPI (Eagle Polytechnic Institute)== The EPI program is for 10th-12th students who wish to have a different high school experience. EPI is a California Partnership Academy that runs as a School within a School format. EPI students share 2-4 classes with each other every year. These classes strive to feature cross-curricular core content and activities focused around manufacturing and engineering. Students of the academy take three tech classes: Pre-engineering Technology 1,2, and 3. In Tech , the students learn the basics of metalworking, CADD, electronics, applied physics, welding, and various other manufacturing processes. Tech 2 builds on engineering design elements taught in Tech 1 and emphasize CADD, prototyping, and 3D printing. Tech 3 is the capstone course that trains students on metalwork including various forms of welding, casting, and manufacturing of Physic class based machines (2018 = Pinball machines). Aside from technical skills, the EPI students will take academic field trips to active construction sites, Intel, the Folsom Forge, various colleges (CSU Sacramento, ARC, Sierra College, St. Mary's, CSU Chico, Universal Technical Institute, and more). The field trips often include visits to engineering and manufacturing marvels that tie into the core content being discussed in their history and English courses, making the information concrete (Examples: taking a transit with the Hawaiian Chieftain around San Francisco Bay, the Bay Model in Sebastapool) As well as, get the opportunity to hear from, and interact with members of the Engineering and Manufacturing industry sector through EPI's business partners (2018 partners - Trico Tools, McCarthy Construction, Intel). Every year EPI hosts its own showcase of student skills during Tech Night. This 2 hour celebration/competition of students include the testing of student bridges, and physics machines, while giving prospective students a chance to meet instructors, see the facilities, and get a chance to talk with current students about the program. EPI, and all California Partnership Academies, are built like families, and are designed to help at risk students to graduate. The students build near sibling level relationships between themselves, while the small group of EPI teachers do their best to make sure every student succeeds. EPI is proud that our family style set up has been able to maintain a 95% graduation rate of our students for over 20 years. EPI is accepts incoming 10th and 11th grade students by application. If you are interested in joining, contact the academy for more information. Schedule sign ups happen in late February and early March, so be looking out EPI ads around the campus and on the website. == Academic Decathlon == El Camino won the Sacramento County Academic Decathlon back-to- back in 1984 and 1985.

Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on April 4, 1936, and is the first Porky Pig solo cartoon. ==Plot== As the cartoon opens, a hooded figure appears at the doorway of a building and leaves behind an alarm clock that suddenly starts smoking. At the next second, the clock explodes, blowing the building to smithereens. Afterwards, newspaper headlines explain that the figure, known as the Mad Bomber, has been terrorizing the entire city by placing time bombs at different buildings to blow them up. As a result, the police are making every effort to search the city and offer a cash reward of $2,000 to anybody who can capture the fiend. In the Mad Bomber's hideout, the Mad Bomber is seen making his next time bomb. He does this by taking apart an alarm clock, stuffing it full of various explosives (dynamite, a black bomb, skyrockets, and firecrackers), and puts the alarm clock back together, to make a bomb that is capable of, as he puts it, \\"blowing up an entire city.\\" After completing his bomb, the Mad Bomber looks at a map of the city, where x's mark the buildings he's already blown up, and draws an x to mark his next target, the Blotz Building. Then he dons a black hat and cloak and makes his way out of the hideout. Elsewhere in the city, Porky Pig is staring into the window of an ice cream parlor where they sell ice cream sodas for 10 cents. After watching a customer buy and drink an ice cream soda, Porky checks his money and decides the five pennies he has are enough for the soda. Porky comes up to the manager and asks for an ice cream soda, but the manager points out that Porky has only half the amount of money for the soda. Porky starts to leave, feeling disappointed, but suddenly gets the idea that half a soda would be worth half the price. He zips back and requests half of a soda, but the manager still tells Porky that he needs five more pennies for the soda. Porky leaves the parlor disappointed and sits down at the curb, wondering how to get five more pennies. As Porky does this, a rich gentleman walks by and drops his cane. Porky notices this and hands back the cane, to which the gentleman thanks Porky by giving him a penny. Overjoyed at being rewarded with a penny, Porky dances a jig and tosses the penny into his pocket, as this has solved his problem. With that, Porky retrieves a glove for a fancy dressed lady (just before the lady picks it up herself) and a handkerchief for Mrs. Cudd (after seeing it all the way from a corner down the street), each time being rewarded with a penny and dancing a jig before putting them into his pocket. During the quest, Porky spies a nickel on the pavement and decides it could save him the trouble of earning two more pennies, but before he can pick it up, a scotty dog zips down all the way from a corner and steals the nickel. Whether the scotty dog dropped the nickel on the ground or the nickel was a rare one is never revealed, the scotty dog doesn't thank Porky for finding it nor reward him with a penny. Undaunted, Porky continues on his quest to retrieve lost items. At this point, on the same street, the Mad Bomber stops outside the Blotz Building. He takes the time bomb out from under his cloak, activates the timer, and leaves the bomb at the base of the building. Porky happens to see the Mad Bomber leave the scene and, thinking the time bomb is just a regular alarm clock and the Mad Bomber lost it, picks up the bomb. He finds the Mad Bomber in an alley, waiting for the explosion, and hands the bomb back to him, in the hopes of being rewarded with a penny, but the Mad Bomber freaks out and runs away, leaving Porky to chase after him. The Mad Bomber then runs through several buildings (with Porky following him) and tries hiding in a garage, but one of the double doors is missing and after the Mad bomber shuts it, Porky appears through the opening and tries to hand back the bomb. The Mad Bomber then zips up the fire escape of an apartment building and makes it to the top, but Porky takes the steps up to meet him with the bomb. The Mad Bomber zips back down and finds Porky at the bottom of the building. He tries ducking into an open manhole to hide under the street, but no matter where he turns, Porky is there, still trying to hand back the bomb. The Mad Bomber finally gets out from under the street and tries blocking the manhole with a safety sign (vowing to have Porky blown to bits), but Porky comes out from another manhole and grabs hold of the Mad Bomber's cloak. At that moment, two policemen spot the Mad Bomber and they pursue him, thinking that Porky holding onto the Mad Bomber's cloak is a sign that Porky's trying to tackle him. The Mad Bomber reaches his hideout, and just as the police, followed by the press arrive at the scene, he locks five doors to the entrance and barricades the last door with various furniture, vowing that they'll never find him. Once more, however, Porky appears and tries to hand back the time bomb. The Mad Bomber decides he's had it and flees the hideout, only to run into the waiting police paddy wagon. Porky then comes out, shoves the bomb (now beginning to smoke) into the paddy wagon, and holds out his hand, expecting the Mad Bomber to pay him a penny for his troubles, but as the paddy wagon drives away to the City Jail, the bomb blows up on its creator, sending fireworks and skyrockets shooting out of the paddy wagon. Since Porky has helped catch the Mad Bomber, the Chief of Police rewards him with the $2000 cash reward. Porky once more dances a victory jig, but as he tosses the money bag into the air (thinking he's been rewarded with a penny), it hits him on the head and bursts open. One of the reporters asks Porky what he intends to do with his reward, to which Porky starts to reply \\"I'm g-g-gonna b-b-b-buy me a...\\" The final scene then shows Porky back in the Ice Cream Parlor gulping down one ice cream soda after another, revealing that he used the $2000 reward to buy a feast of 20,000 ice cream sodas. ==Outside references== Thomas Pynchon refers to the cartoon involving \\"Porky Pig and the anarchist\\" several times in his novels The Crying of Lot 49 (Vintage, 2000, p63) and Gravity's Rainbow. ==ReferencesCategory:1936 animated films Category:1936 films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1936 comedy films Category:American films Category:American animated short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Bernard B.

They resided at \\"Brookefield\\", which is now called \\"The Valley\\", near Nottingham, Prince George's Co., Maryland. Sarah (Fendall) Contee (1732‚Äì1793), was the daughter of Benjamin Fendall I, Esq. (1708‚Äì1764) and first wife, Eleanor Lee (1710‚Äì1759). Sarah was born February 7, 1732 at \\"Potomoe\\", Charles County., Maryland. Sarah was described as a very beautiful woman with a wealth of golden hair; Contee left a portrait which reveals a mild, handsome face, powdered hair, ruffled shirt and stock.Warfield, J. D., p265 The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties Maryland Retrieved August 2, 2010 Contee inherited through his mother, the estate \\"Brookefield\\", the original home of his ancestor, Maj. Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq. (1632‚Äì1676). Contee was a merchant by 1764, and was an attorney in fact for William Molleson, of London, England in 1766. He was engaged in a tobacco trade business with Capt. Fielder Bowie (ca. 1745‚Äì1794), which imported large quantities of goods until the firm disbanded in 1775. Contee had management of a store at Pig Point in Bristol in southern Anne Arundel County from 1772‚Äì1775, and was an agent for his sons Alexander and Benjamin, in Nottingham, and Upper Marlboro. ===Children=== # Alexander Contee (1752‚Äì1810), who never married. # Capt.

He was chairman of various meetings of the citizens in Marlboro, was member of the House of Burgesses (Maryland), a delegate to the first convention held at Annapolis in 1770, and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Association of Freeman of Maryland in 1775. In September of the same year he was elected to the Committee of Observation. Too old for active duty, Contee in 1776 was commissioned a Major of Militia by the Council of Safety and instructed to inspect the newly raised troops and to aid in the equipment of the volunteer forces. In November 1776, he was elected a member of the Council of Safety which continued to act until March 20, 1777, when the new state government was organized. He was sent to Philadelphia to confer with the Continental Congress as to the proper organization of the army and the general plans for defense. Contee also served as Chairman of the Patuxent Associators. ==Public service== Contee was elected to the state legislature and for many years was chairman of the Republican Party in Prince George's County. Contee was a vestryman for St. Pauls's Parish, Prince George's County. In 1811, at the time of his death, Contee had amassed in Prince George's, Baltimore, and Frederick counties, 4 lots in Prince George's and Montgomery counties, plus in Kentucky. His estate was valued at $9,167.75, including 19 slaves, books, and silver. A picture of Col. Contee shows a mild, handsome face and powdered hair. According to the 1790 census, Contee owned 25 slaves. A portrait of John Hanson by John Hesselius, around 1765 to 1770. Contee' older sister Jane Hanson, married John Hanson (1721‚Äì1783), of \\"Mulberry Grove\\", who some say was the first President of the United States. On November 5, 1781, he was elected by a large majority, President of the Congress and in 1782, as head of the new nation, issued letters of marque to prey upon the British Commerce. These commissions were signed \\"John Hanson, President\\"; from which fact he is spoken of as the first President of the United States. Contee Family Coat of Arms ==Ancestry== Contee was the son of Alexander Contee (1693‚Äì1740) and Jane Brooke (1702‚Äì1779). Jane was the daughter of Col. Thomas Brooke, Jr., Hon. (1660‚Äì1730) of \\"Brookefield\\", President of Maryland and his second wife, Barbara Dent (1676‚Äì1754). Col. Thomas Brooke, Jr., was the son of Maj. Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq. (1632‚Äì1676), of \\"Brookefield\\", and Eleanor (Hatton) Darnall (1642‚Äì1745), who married secondly Col. Henry Darnall, Sr. (1645‚Äì1711). Alexander was the son of Dr. Peter Contee (d. 1714), of Barnstaple, Devonshire, England, and his first wife Catherine. Peter immigrated in about 1703 and resided in Charles County, before taking up permanent residence in Prince George's County. Peter was a surgeon, and married secondly, Francis (?) Hopkins. Francis was the widow of Capt. William Hopkins (d. 1702). Peter was the son of Adolphe de Conti and his wife Grace. Adolphe was a Huguenot who immigrated to England from France during the reign of Louis XIII, King of France (1601‚Äì1643). The motto under his Arms in Guild Hall, London is, \\"pour dieu et mon roi\\" (\\"for God and my king\\"). Alexander, was born in April 1693, in Barnstaple, Devonshire, England. He immigrated around 1703, and resided in Charles County about 1720. He joined his uncle, Col. John Contee (d. 1708), who though married twice, had no children, and whose will provided liberally for Alexander. Alexander was a prosperous merchant at Nottingham Prince George's Co., Clerk of the Court; and from 1720 to 1724, member of the Lower House of the General Assembly. He was a vestryman of St. Paul's Parish. He married about 1720, Jane Brooke. Jane inherited a portion of \\"Brookefield\\", her father's estate. \\"Brookefield\\", also known as \\"The Valley\\", and was located near Nottingham in Prince George's County. At the time of his death on December 24, 1740, Alexander had amassed at least of land, and his estate was valued at 1,613.2.11 pounds sterling, plus 3,827.19.8 pounds current money. This included 32 slaves, 2 servants, books, and clerk's writing equipment. Alexander's will contained a heraldic shield only, with a chevron on which are charges and beasts in dexter, middle and sinister chief and middle base. The arms of the Conte of Montulle, Normandy, contain a chevron and three mullets described as \\"Azure chevron or between three mullets or\\". The Contees came to Maryland from England, but they were of French descent Huguenots, who emigrated to Barnstable, in Devonshire, to escape the religious persecutions which culminated in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The name originally de Conti, appears among the French nobility from a very early date. As far back as 1375, Isabella, dame de Conti, married Colard de Mailly. Their great granddaughter married in 1551, Louis I, Prince de Conde, a cadet of the Bourbons who ascended the French throne in the person of Henry IV, King of France and Navare (1553‚Äì1610). The second son of this latter marriage, Francois de Bourbon, was Prince de Conti, but had no issue and the title was revived from Armand de Bourbon, a cadet of the great Conde but expired for lack of male issue. The Vicomte de Conti arms are identical with those of the Rochelle family and also with those of the Marquis de Graviers, Comte de Noirant (of Normandy) and Baron de Conti (of Orange). ==See also== * Colonial families of Maryland ==References== Category:People from Nottingham, Maryland Category:Members of the Maryland House of Delegates Category:Maryland militiamen in the American Revolution Category:People from Maryland in the War of 1812 Category:Fendall family Category:People of colonial Maryland Category:People of Maryland in the American Revolution Category:American planters Category:1729 births Category:1811 deaths Category:18th-century American politicians Category:American slave owners ","title":"Thomas Contee"},{"id":"9104361","text":"Flavius Bauto (died c. 385) was a Romanised Frank who served as a magister militum of the Roman Empire.

The farming community of New Hope, which was actually Benson Corners, Portage County, Wisconsin was the inspiration for the book.\\"Small Communities, Benson Corners,\\" Portage County (Wisconsin) Historical Society The screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo and was his last before being blacklisted for refusing to testify before the House Un- American Activities Committee; Margaret O'Brien later said the movie was largely ignored for decades afterwards because of Trumbo's political troubles.TCM Night at the Movies: Merry Christmas! Told from the viewpoint of little Selma (O‚ÄôBrien), the film explores grand childhood adventures: making friends, a pet calf, Christmas, a terrifying trip down a flood-swollen river, a barn fire and a ride on a circus elephant‚Äôs trunk. Its title comes from Chapter 2, Verse 15 in the Song of Solomon in the King James version of the Bible, which reads \\"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.\\" ==Plot== The story is about a Norwegian immigrant farmer in Wisconsin, Martinius Jacobson (Edward G. Robinson), his wife Bruna (Agnes Moorehead) and their seven-year-old daughter Selma (Margaret O'Brien), who is often bedeviled by her playmate and five-year-old cousin Arnold (Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins). Martinius simply wants to work his land and be a loving husband and father to his family. The one great ambition in the life of Martinius is to build a new barn, but tragedy strikes. How the family copes with that is the core and the charm of the film. Selma lives a carefree, joyous life, which is only temporarily clouded by the sudden death of Ingeborg Jensen (Dorothy Morris), an emotionally disturbed young woman whose stern father (Charles B. Middleton) had refused to let her attend school despite the pleas of newly arrived schoolmarm Viola Johnson (Frances Gifford). Inspired by young Selma, the entire town of Fuller Junction come to the aid of proud Bjorn Bjornson (Morris Carnovsky), who has lost his livestock when lightning struck and burned down his newly erected‚Äîbut uninsured‚Äîbarn. When Selma generously donates her pet calf to the impoverished farmer, the townspeople in general, and Martinius in particular, follow suit, prompting Viola to reconsider her harsh views of country life and retract her letter of resignation to the school board.Our Vines Have Tender Grapes at AllMovie ==Cast== * Edward G.

She is an Ivor Novello Award winner who has earned critical acclaim in dozens of music magazines both in the UK and the US, including Folk Album of the Year from The Sunday Times. Howe began an acting career in the late 1960s, and has since gained a following in folk music: Record Collector in 2007 called her \\"one of the great unrecognised voices\\". Observer Music in 2007 said \\"Catherine Howe was a Kate Bush before her time\\". ==1960s‚Äì1970s: early career== Howe trained as an actress at the Corona Drama School in London. She commenced an acting career in the late 1960s, performing in contemporary television dramas such as Z-Cars, The Wednesday Play, Doctor Who, Undermind and Dixon of Dock Green. Howe went on to appear in Barney Platts- Mills' film, Private Road. In 1970 Howe met Andrew Cameron Miller, an executive at Reflection, a subsidiary of CBS Records, resulting in her recording her debut album What A Beautiful Place at Trident Studios in London, in February 1971. Miller paired Howe with Bobby Scott, an American pianist and record producer who had previously co-written The Hollies' \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\". However Reflection ceased to trade when the album was on the point of release, and as a result it remained largely unheard until it was reissued in 2007 on the Numero label. The re-release met with critical acclaim, gaining a five-star review from Observer Music. The master tapes were by then lost, and the re-recording was made from an original source copy. Howe featured on soundtrack recordings in the UK and Europe throughout the 1970s, and provided the lead vocal for Ennio Morricone's theme song \\"Un genie, deux associ√©s, une cloche\\" in 1976. She worked with the Italian jazz musician Piero Piccioni, recording two songs for his 1972 film God Under the Skin and singing in an Italian television broadcast with Piccioni two years later. Howe's second LP Harry was released in the UK in 1975 on RCA, for which the title track received an Ivor Novello Award (only the second female recording artist to achieve this) and became enduringly popular on BBC Radio 2. Also in 1974, Howe appeared on film as the singer during the title credits of the British sex farce, Can You Keep It Up for a Week?. RCA released a follow-up album, Silent Mother Nature in 1976, winning Folk Album of the Year from the Sunday Times. A single was released entitled \\"Until The Morning Comes\\" written by the Scottish singer/guitarist Dave Kelly and Ray McRiner, and was performed on LWT's Supersonic. The following year, the title tracks of both RCA albums were re-released (together with the aforementioned single) on the EP The Truth of the Matter, and was one of the Top 75 selling EPs of 1977. Throughout that year Howe produced and sang the songs for BBC Television's That's Life!. Howe's fourth album came two years later, Dragonfly Days, released on Ariola Records. Dragonfly Days featured the \\"Creme de La Creme\\" of English session musicians including drummer Peter Boita and the guitarist Alan Parker amongst others. Ariola also released singles by Howe prior to and following the album, some of which are not included on the LP, and promoted as far away as South America. The third single \\"Quietly and Softly\\" also featured as the B-side to \\"Switchboard\\" by Georg Kajanus' group \\"April Love\\". One was with Mike Batt, Howe's self-penned \\"Sit Down And Think Again\\", another was a cover of Carole King's \\"Goin' Back\\" produced by Pip Williams. Dragonfly Days remains her only record not reissued on CD. Howe also contributed vocals to two tracks for an album by Michael Giles of King Crimson, Progress, recorded in 1978 but unreleased until 2002. In 1979, the BBC transmitted Rhythm on 2: Catherine Howe and Judie Tzuke, a live concert at Ipswich's Corn Exchange.BBC Genome listing originally from Radio Times, 10 December 1979 The following year, again for the BBC, Howe featured on both the Jeremy TaylorGenome listing, 5 June 1980 and Sacha DistelGenome listing, 11 January 1980 shows. ==1980s-present: respite and return to music== None of Howe's albums sold in large quantity in their time, and after Dragonfly Days, she decided to retire from the music industry. Howe explained in her own words on the tradmusic.com website: \\"Despite promotion and tours with Andy Fairweather-Low, Chris de Burgh, David Soul and later with Randy Edelman, the albums and singles didn't sell enough. I thought it was because of me, but it was as much (I've since learned) because they weren't in the shops to buy. To remedy this it was suggested that maybe I should write 'country and western', maybe I should change my hair, maybe wear black leather. So the music business, which I loved, and I parted company. Like a bad marriage, some damage was sustained before separation took place....\\" There was some activity in the 1980s with a re-issue of the \\"Harry\\" single in 1984 (due to public demand with the birth of Prince Harry). A year later, Howe contributed two songs to the Sounds of Yorkshire LP: a re-recording of \\"Lucy Snow\\" (\\"Lucy Snowe\\") from the Silent Mother Nature album; and a new piece in a traditional vein, \\"Yorkshire Hills\\". In 1989 Howe had a daughter, Jenny, and later earned a first class degree in History and Religion from the Open University. In 2002, the Michael Giles album Progress was released on CD: Howe contributed vocals for tracks Sunset and Arrival. In the same year, Howe returned to solo recording: producing a new CD, her fifth, Princelet Street. It coincided with the launch of an official website and preceded the re-issue of her 1970s albums What a Beautiful Place (with the Numero label), Harry (with BGO) and Silent Mother Nature (with BGO). Of Princelet Street, Howe wrote: > My great-grandmother Susannah Constantine was born on Princelet Street in > 1851, her mother worked as a silk winder, her father as a fancy comb maker. > Lots of my family lived in or near the City of London in the early 1800s, > and even before I knew this I used to go city walking there as a girl > because it felt like coming home. Princelet Street the album is inspired by > the street and a sense of family, past and present, and as I enjoyed writing > and recording its songs I hope you'll enjoy hearing them.... Catherine Howe continues to work on new recordings, also giving occasional live performances. As an author, Howe's book on the life of the 19th-century secularist George Holyoake was published by History into Print in 2012. A second book focused on the radical history of her home town of Halifax. In 2020, London Story 1848 was published. Catherine Howe has also contributed verse and lyrics for publication in themed editions of Playerist Poetry Magazine. ==Discography== Studio albums: * What a Beautiful Place ‚Äì 1971 * Harry ‚Äì 1975 * Silent Mother Nature ‚Äì 1976 * Dragonfly Days ‚Äì 1979 * Princelet Street ‚Äì 2005 * English Tale ‚Äì with Vo Fletcher, 2010 * Because It Would Be Beautiful ‚Äì 2015 Original soundtracks, compilation albums and re-releases: * Il dio sotto la pelle OST ‚Äì 1972 * Un genie, deux associes, une cloche OST ‚Äì 1976 * Sounds of Yorkshire (compilation) ‚Äì 1985 (Contributes two tracks) * Progress (Michael Giles album, 1978) ‚Äì 2002 (Vocals for two tracks) * Harry / Silent Mother Nature Re-mastered CD ‚Äì 2006 * What a Beautiful Place Re- mastered CD, with previously unreleased demo track ‚Äì 2007 * What a Beautiful Place Re-mastered LP, with previously unreleased demo track ‚Äì 2010 Singles and EPs: * \\"Nothing More Than strangers\\" / \\"My Child\\" ‚Äì Reflection, 1971 * \\"Firestar Express\\" / \\"Forse eri tu\\" / \\"St. Francis in Katmandu\\" ‚Äì CBS, Italian release with Piero Piccioni, 1974 * \\"Harry\\" / \\"When The Sparrow Flies\\" ‚Äì RCA, 1974 * \\"What Are Friends for Anyway?\\" / \\"Keep Me Talking\\" ‚Äì RCA, 1976 * \\"Freedom Enough\\" / \\"Lucy Snow\\" ‚Äì RCA, 1976 * \\"Until The Morning Comes\\" / \\"Lucy Snow\\" ‚Äì RCA, 1976 * \\"The Truth of the Matter\\" EP ‚Äì \\"Until The Morning Comes\\" / \\"Harry\\" / \\"Silent Mother Nature\\" ‚Äì RCA, 1977 * \\"Sit Down and Think Again\\" / \\"Someone's Got to Love You Sometime\\" ‚Äì Ariola, produced by Mike Batt, 1978 * \\"Move On Over\\" / \\"Too Far Gone\\" ‚Äì Ariola, 1978 * \\"Turn The Corner Singing\\" / \\"Too Far Gone\\" ‚Äì Ariola, 1979 * \\"Quietly and Softly\\" / \\"Daylight\\" ‚Äì Ariola, 1979 * \\"Switchboard\\" (April Love) / \\"Quietly and Softly\\" (Catherine Howe) ‚Äì Ariola, 1979 * \\"When The Night Comes\\" / \\"How Does Love Feel?\\" ‚Äì Ariola, 1980 * \\"Goin' Back\\" / \\"How Does Love Feel?\\" ‚Äì Ariola, 1980 * \\"Almost Love\\" (vocal version of Inside Moves theme) / \\"Inside Moves\\" theme (instrumental) ‚Äì Breeze, 1981 * \\"Harry\\" / \\"When The Sparrow Flies\\" ‚Äì RCA, reissue in blue and gold sleeve, 1984 * \\"In the Hot Summer\\" / \\"Let's Keep it Quiet Now\\" ‚Äì Numero, 2010 * \\"Going Home\\" EP / \\"Nothing Love Does Surprises Me\\" / \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" ‚Äì with Vo Fletcher, Proper Music, 2010 ==Theme songs== * \\"It's Possible,\\" title track from God Under the Skin [Il dio sotto la pelle] (1972) Composer: Piero Piccioni / Director: Folco Quilici * \\"Firestar Express\\" from an Italian TV show, with Piero Piccioni (1974) Composer: Piero Piccioni * \\"Keep It For Me,\\" title track from Can You Keep It Up for a Week?

It is the third- busiest airport in Egypt after Cairo International Airport and Hurghada International Airport. ==Overview== The airport was opened on 14 May 1968 as an Israeli Air Force base. After the signing of the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty in 1979 and subsequent Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, it was reopened as a civilian airport. The largest regular aircraft using the airport was a Transaero Airlines-operated Boeing 747-400. These flights transiting from Moscow ended when Transaero ceased operations in October 2015. British Airways operated the only regular scheduled Boeing 777-200ER service (from Gatwick Airport). However, this service (and others) has ceased due to concerns over the downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 on 31 October 2015. In 2008, the Egyptian Airports Holding Company (EAHC) announced plans to build a third new terminal at the airport. In July 2009 the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation (EHCAAN) signed a contract with Spanish construction designers Pointec for the third terminal. The terminal was planned to double the airport's capacity from 7.5 to 15 million passengers per year. The project's primary costs were estimated at $350 million. The design phase was due to be completed by early 2010. International contractors then were invited for an open tender to construct the terminal, which was scheduled to be completely constructed by 2015. By September 2016 construction had not commenced. In November 2015, passenger numbers significantly decreased due to the downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 on 31 October 2015. This led to airlines cancelling flights from the airport and operating rescue flights for stranded passengers. Governments from Russia and European countries such as the United Kingdom banned airlines from operating to the airport, citing safety concerns that were highlighted following the crash. The Government of the United Kingdom, HM Government advised against all travel to and from Sharm El Sheikh. In January 2018, it was announced that EgyptAir Express would open a base at the airport for its incoming fleet of Airbus A220s. This would increase the amount of destinations served by the airline at the airport with the possibility of operating to cities in Italy, Germany, Morocco and India non- stop. On 22 October 2019 the UK lifted the flight ban on flights between UK airports and Sharm El Sheikh. On 1 November 2019 TUI AG, parent company of TUI Airways and TUI UK announced a resumption of flights to the airport, starting in February 2020. == Terminals  Terminal 1 === On 23 May 2007, the airport's second terminal was inaugurated with a capacity for 5 million passengers per year. The two-level, terminal features 40 check-in counters and is designed to cater to a large number of international and chartered flights. It has two domestic and six international gates, all of which exit to remote stands. The terminal comprises three building components: two circular-shaped halls fused together by a wedge-shaped intermediate space dubbed 'the boat'. This serves as a passenger transit hub housing passport control, duty-free, and VIP areas as well as cafes/restaurants. The halls, in stark textural contrast to the solid mass of 'the boat', feature airy, billowing tent-like roofs inspired by the indigenous Bedouin culture. === Terminal 2 === Although known as Terminal 2, this is actually the airport's original terminal building. The building underwent a complete modernisation programme in 2004 and has a passenger handling capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year. Since the inauguration of Terminal 1 in 2007 most airlines have shifted operations to the new building. In December 2016 Egyptian Airports Company announced plans to extend Terminal 2. EAC plans to expand the terminal and increase its capacity by two million passengers per year, thus taking the total capacity of the airport to 9.5 million. This also includes the construction of a new runway and 40 new airsides. In November 2019, it was announced part of the expansion of Terminal 2 had been completed increasing the airports annual capacity, from 7 million, to 9 million a year. The plan aims to increase the capacity to 20 million passengers per annum as the number of tourists visiting the resort city is rising, during winter in particular. For now, the number of gates was raised to 12 from 8. The total cost of development works in the airport has reached LE 800 million so far. ==Airlines and destinations== Departure hall at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport Control tower at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport ==Accidents and incidents== * On January 3, 2004, Flash Airlines Flight 604, en route to Cairo and then Paris as its final destination, crashed in the Red Sea shortly after taking off from Sharm El Sheikh, killing all 148 people on board. Causes for the accident include pilot error and instrument failure, but investigators have been unable to reach a consensus. * On August 23, 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it; the missile missed the airliner by about 1,000 feet (300 meters), and the plane landed safely. An investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34754577 * On October 31, 2015, Metrojet Flight 9268, en route from Sharm El Sheikh to St. Petersburg, Russia, crashed in the Sinai Peninsula between Nekhel and Housna, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian tourists. The jihadist group ISIL, at war with Russian forces in nearby Syria, quickly claimed responsibility for the crash, which was believed by western governments to be the result of a terrorist bombing. Russian investigators confirmed in mid-November that the flight was bombed; the investigation is still ongoing. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh suspended until further notice. == See also == *List of airports in Egypt ==ReferencesCategory:1968 establishments in Egypt Category:Airports established in 1968 Category:Airports in Egypt Category:Sharm El Sheikh ","title":"Sharm El Sheikh International Airport"},{"id":"9104399","text":"The Wood County Courthouse is a public building in downtown Parkersburg, West Virginia, in the United States.

Based on the play Bless You Sister by John Meehan and Robert Riskin, the film is about a preacher's daughter who becomes disillusioned by the mistreatment of her dying father by his church. Having grown cynical about religion, she teams up with a con man and performs fake miracles for profit. The love and trust of a blind man, however, restores her faith in God and her fellow man. The Miracle Woman was the second of five film collaborations between Capra and Stanwyck.

He is most well known for his contributions to aviation technology, including his invention, the Aircraft Stall Warning device, which warns pilots when a deadly aerodynamic stall is imminent. To build the device, Greene established the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in 1946. Apart from his inventive life, Greene also served as the founder and president of the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies, a think tank to address issues such as poverty and social awareness. Additionally, he co-founded the Corporate Angel Network, a charitable organization that flies patients in corporate aircraft. In 1991, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Greene died on November 30, 2006 at the age of 88 in Mamaroneck, New York. The cause was complications from lung cancer. ==Early life & family== Leonard M. Greene was born in New York City on June 8, 1918. Max Greene, his chemist father, and Lyn Furman Greene, his artist mother, encouraged their son to create his own toys. His parents made him a gift of their old stove, which he could take apart. Greene experienced poverty as a youth during the Depression and never forgot it. When Leonard was 16, his father had passed away. Greene first married Beverly Kaufman, with whom he had three children; this, however, ended in divorce. Then, he adopted four children of his second wife, Phyllis Saks Greene, with whom he had another child. Phyllis Saks Greene, an heiress of the Saks Fifth Avenue department store family, died in 1965. Greene‚Äôs third marriage was to Joyce Teck Meller in 1967, which also ended up in divorce in 2005. A son from the second marriage, Donald Greene, died September 11, 2001, abroad United Airlines Flight 93 when it crashed in Pennsylvania. ==Education== Leonard Greene graduated in 1938 from the City College of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry, and went on to receive a M.S. in aeronautical engineering. He received a pilot‚Äôs license at the age of 19 and later did postgraduate work in aeronautics at the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at New York University. In 1977, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa by Pace University. ==InventionsAviation & safe flight instruments=== Stall Warning Device During World War II, Greene joined the Grumman Aircraft Corporation in Bethpage, NY, as an aerodynamicist and engineering test pilot. There he witnessed an aircraft crash caused by stall. In aviation, a stall occurs when the airflow over the wings is no longer sufficient to provide lift ‚Äì essentially, a stalled wing ceases to function. This happens when the wing exceeds its critical angle of attack. Greene realized that the accident could have been avoided if the pilot had been warned of an imminent stall. Aerodynamic stalls caused the majority of aviation deaths at the time. In the mid-1940s, Greene developed the first practical way to warn the pilot of the aerodynamic stall. His first design and apparatus included threaded bolts, a bicycle horn and other odd components, all powered by flashlight batteries. Greene filed his device for a patent in 1944, and the patent was issued in 1949. In order to develop his design, Greene founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, in 1946. There, he refined and marketed the stall warning indicator. Basically, his device sounded an alert when the plane was in danger of not having enough lift to stay flying. This alert would allow time for the pilot to take corrective measures. Since its invention, this device became standard equipment for all aircraft and has also helped reduce the number of accidents due to stalling. The Stall Warning Indicator was called ‚Äúthe greatest lifesaver since the invention of the parachute‚Äù[14] by the Saturday Evening Post and the device received the Flight Safety Foundation‚Äôs first Air Safety Award. Automatic Throttle System & Wind Shear Warning System After developing the Stall Warning Device, Greene continued developing aviation inventions. He and his engineering staff at Safe Flight went on to conceive devices now commonplace in aircraft, including an automatic throttle system in 1956 and a wind-shear warning system that warns a pilot if an aircraft enters a dangerous microburst and provides escape guidance. He developed the latter in the late 1970s after a series of wind-shear-related crashes that claimed hundreds of lives. Supersonic aircraft In his 2001 book Inventorship: The Art of Innovation, Greene described finding \\"creative ideas in the simplest things.\\"8 To address a key problem of supersonic aircraft ‚Äì window-shattering sonic booms when they break the sound barrier ‚Äì he turned to the earthworm for inspiration. Just as an earthworm eats and excretes the earth to move past mounds of dirt, he figured a supersonic aircraft's deafening boom is caused from its inability to move air out of its way fast enough to avoid external shock waves. He patented a device, sold to Boeing in 1994, that would use a hollow fuselage and strategically placed ducts to suck in, compress, and then release air through a plane's tail. ===Outcome=== Today, his firm supplies unique air safety and performance technology to virtually every major air carrier, the U.S. Armed Forces, and aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Safe Flight products are installed on over two-thirds of the world‚Äôs aircraft ‚Äì in the general aviation, commercial, and military sectors. Safe Flight made Leonard Greene a multimillionaire. He remained involved in the business until his death and as recently as 1998 co-patented and marketed an airborne power line detector and warning system for helicopters. ===Non-aviation interests=== While running Safe Flight, Greene received dozens of patents for his varied interests; many of them went un-marketed. They included a three-dimensional chess game, a device to aid blind painters by using musical notes to identify colors, and an instrument of revenge against telemarketers who interrupted dinner. When a pitchman called, the harassed resident could press a code that alerted the marketer that he would be liable for a surcharge for continuing the call. ==Policy and charitable workInstitute for Socioeconomic Studies=== As a successful businessman, Greene implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility. Seeking a broader forum and greater impact for his ideas, in 1974 he founded and financed the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies (ISES), a small policy research organization in White Plains, NY, that helped advance his ideas on welfare reform, health care, tax reform ‚Äì and after Greene‚Äôs son was killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001 ‚Äì foreign affairs. According to Ostergren, who worked with Green at ISES, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt consider himself a Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal,‚Äù13 but searched for practical solutions to problems that intrigued him. He advocated a national tax rebate ‚Äì $12,000 for any family of four, regardless of income, for instance ‚Äì to alleviate poverty. Greene criticized the Great Society anti-poverty programs of the 1960s as ineffective, a waste of taxpayer dollars, and a disincentive to work. He has also made his mark as a social activist, having designed a plan to transform the federal social budget to provide greater income security, middle class tax relief, and market incentives for productivity growth. In pursuit of these interests, Greene was a member of both the Special Committee on Welfare & Income Maintenance and the Council on Trends & Perspectives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also served as a member in the Income Maintenance Committee of the Community Service Society and the Work Group on Welfare Reform of the Task Force on the New York City fiscal crisis. ===Corporate Angel Network=== In 1981, Greene, whose second wife died of cancer, helped start and finance Corporate Angel Network (CAN), a charitable organization which arranges free transportation on corporate jets for cancer patients. This organization has 500 participating corporations who generously offer their empty seats to cancer patients. CAN flies more than 2,500 cancer patients a year. To date, the organization has flown more than 50,000 patients to treatment centers nationwide. Greene flew the first Corporate Angel Network Flight on December 22, 1981, when he brought a 16-year-old cancer patient home to Detroit who had just received treatment in New York City. ==Sailing== An avid sailor, Greene became a technical adviser to several America's Cup races before buying two-time winner Courageous from Ted Turner in the early 1980s. Sailing under the aegis of the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, the only undergraduate sailing club ever to participate, the Courageous Syndicates 1986 run at the Cup spearheaded Greene's campaign to restore the Corinthian ideals of amateur sportsmanship to the competition, and more broadly, to team sports in general. Despite several of Greene's modifications to the keel, the boat's age remained a problem, and his team withdrew during the 1986 competition. Following the 1997 donation of Courageous to the Museum of Yachting in Newport, RI, the famed 12-meter was named Rhode Island's State Yacht. ==Awards and achievements== *Private Sector Initiative Commendation of the President of the United States (1982 and 1984) *National Inventors Hall of Fame (1991) **Senator John H.

He entered the Royal Navy in June 1804, aboard HMS Glory. He followed his captain to Barfleur, and in June 1805, went with his brother Peter to the sloop Weazel. In March 1806, he went aboard Eagle, and was engaged in active service off Italy. By 1809, he was aboard St George, the flagship of Rear- Admiral Francis Pickmore in the Baltic Sea. He later served on the massive San Josef (captured at Cape St. Vincent in 1797) and from May 1810, aboard the frigate Unit√©. Promoted lieutenant on 17 June 1811, he was badly injured not long afterwards in a fall from the quarterdeck, and was invalided out in August 1811 to recover. Parker was able to return to the service in early 1812, under his brother Peter in the frigate Menelaus. In May 1812, Charles moved to Malta, wherein he served until 5 April 1815, when he was promoted commander. From 1819 to 1822, he served in Harlequin off the coast of Ireland, and was promoted to post-captain on 23 April 1822, but saw no further service after that year. On the retired list, he was promoted rear-admiral in 1852, vice-admiral in 1857, and admiral in 1863. Parker married Georgiana Ellis Pallmer, but had no children.

The World Players Association (World Players) represents 85,000 players across professional sport through more than 100 player associations in over 60 countries under the #WorldPlayersUnited strategy. World Players has been particularly active in ensuring the fundamental human rights of the athletes and everyone involved in the delivery of world sport are protected, respected and upheld in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). In particular: * On 14 December 2017, World Players launched the Universal Declaration of Player Rights, which Schwab was instrumental in drafting. The Declaration contains 17 articles which set out the fundamental rights of players under international human rights law. Signatories to the Declaration include some of the biggest sports unions in the world including FIFPro, the MLBPA, the NBPA, and the NFLPA. * The Sport and Rights Alliance, which includes World Players, the International Trade Union Confederation, UNI Global Union and NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Terres des Hommes and Transparency International Germany, has led discussions with the International Olympic Committee, FIFA and UEFA which have seen the incorporation of human rights standards and the UNGPs into the host city contract for the 2024 Olympic Games, the bidding and staging agreements for the 2024 UEFA EUROs, and the adoption by FIFA of a binding human rights policy. * The Centre for Sport and Human Rights brings together an unprecedented alliance of intergovernmental institutions, governments, sports bodies, athletes, hosts, sponsors, broadcasters, civil society representatives, trade unions, employers and their associations, and national human rights institutions. The Centre gew out of the work of the Mega Sporting Events Platform, a multi-stakeholder initiative, in which Schwab co-chaired the task force for the people impacted by such events. Launched on 26 June 2018, the Centre works towards a world of sport that fully respects human rights by sharing knowledge, building capacity, and strengthening accountability of all actors through collective action and promotion of the Sporting Chance Principles.Sporting Chance Principles World Players, as a founding member, is represented by Schwab on the Centre's advisory council.

It is situated by road, about 14 kilometres south of Batlow and 22 kilometres north of Tumbarumba. In the late 1800s, gold mining was being carried out at a location about 12 km south of Batlow on the Paddy's River. This location, named Quartzville, was home at one point to about 2000 people. A dam for the washing of alluvial gold and sluicing operations was constructed at the site. The population in the area extended into the Bago forest area and Laurel Hill came into being on the route taken by coaches from Adelong to Tumbarumba. Bago Post Office opened on 10 June 1878, was renamed Laurel Hill in 1880 and closed in 1989. The Miners Arms hotel at Laurel Hill was owned by the Waters family who held the licence until 1887, when it was taken over by Mr Dickson Currie. Mary Ann Waters took over the hotel as licensee in 1891 and Mr Currie built a new hotel for her in the early 1900s, as the old building had been condemned. The new hotel was located on the opposite side of the road to the original pub. Mr Jim Waters bought the new hotel in 1910 and operated it until 1928 when it was sold to a Mr Hayden. The hotel was later sold to Mr George King, who remodelled the building, altering the roof and enclosing the front verandah. Mr King later moved to Batlow and the hotel was taken over for a time by Mrs Latham, before she too moved to Batlow. The hotel building burned down in 1958 and was not replaced. Sign for Laurel Hill Camp Laurel Hill Prison Farm was established in 1957. It was renamed the Leslie Nott Afforestation Camp in 1958 and then the Laurel Hill Forest Camp, under the direction of the Forestry Commission of New South Wales. It is now a privately owned conference centre. == Climate == Bago State Forest, about 16 km southwards of Batlow, yields a cooler climate owing to its much greater elevation. Snow is frequent from May to September, and often falls heavily; snowfall can be expected at any time of the year. The region is subject to high winds year-round. Climate data is sourced from Pilot Hill, which lies at 1,128 m AMSL‚Äî343 m higher than Green Hills State Forest. ==Notes and references== Category:Towns in the Riverina Category:Towns in New South Wales ","title":"Laurel Hill, New South Wales"},{"id":"9104548","text":"Sumolah (Let's Sumo!) is a 2007 Malaysian action-comedy film starring Afdlin Shauki and featuring the Japanese sport of sumo wrestling. The film was shot in Malaysia and Japan. The film has a multi-national cast including Thai actress Inthira Charoenpura who was previously known for her performance in Nang Nak, and Singaporean actor Gurmit Singh known for his performance in the sitcom Phua Chu Kang. The plot of the film revolves about what would happen if an unambitious Malay mat rempit is forced to enter the challenging world of sumo. This film is rated PG13 for intense sumo violence, some drug content, sexual references and brief strong language. This film was a financial failure despite critical success. ==Plot== Ramlee (Afdlin Shauki) is a down and out Malay boy who cannot seem to hold down a job, much to his mother‚Äôs (Kartina Aziz) disappointment. Out of a job and out of money, he stumbles across a challenge by sushi restaurant owner Honda (Patrick Teoh) to ‚Äúeat all you can for free food ‚Äì within a time limit‚Äù. Hungry and desperate, Ramlee attempts the challenge, and fails. In compensation, Honda (Patrick Teoh) lets Ramlee take a job at the restaurant to pay off his due. Ramlee becomes a member of the Boleh Sushi shop staff, along with Haris (Awie) and Andy (Radhi Khalid). Ramlee is immediately attracted to Honda‚Äôs beautiful daughter, Siti (Intira Jaroenpura), who is half-Japanese and half-Malay. He begins to learn the meaning of having good work, good friends and family. One day he learns that part of his obligation is to take part in the Malaysian Sushi Association Amateur Sumo Wrestling Championships held by the local Japanese owners of sushi restaurants. Whilst taking part in the initial friendly bout, Akira (Gurmit Singh), Siti‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, humiliates him in public. It is only after that that Ramlee finds out that he had been tricked into working for Boleh Sushi because Honda was desperate for a third member for their team. Ramlee has to make a choice ‚Äì whether to stay on and fight for Boleh Sushi in the upcoming Championships, or to give up on his new-found family. He decides to step up to the challenge and begins training with the boys for the big fight. He learns the meaning of the word nokotta ‚Äì never give up, the fight is not yet won. He learns that no matter what the result, the honour is in fighting the good fight.

It was first released in 2007, but was discontinued in 2014; its features were carried over to its successor, Norton Security. In 2019, Symantec, under its new corporate name NortonLifeLock, began promoting a \\"NEW Norton 360\\" as a product replacement for Norton Security. ==Version historyProject Genesis=== Symantec announced Project Genesis on February 7, 2006. Genesis would differ from Symantec's other consumer security products by incorporating file backup and performance optimization tools with antivirus capabilities and a firewall. Phishing protection and real-time heuristics were also planned. Windows Vista compatibility was a major aspect of Genesis. Genesis was slated for release in September. In May 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live OneCare, a security suite with similar functionalities, slated for release in 2006. Genesis was renamed Norton 360 on May 31, 2006. Its feature set was confirmed‚Äîit would have the same functionalities as Norton Internet Security‚Äîwith file backup, performance tools, phishing protection, and real-time heuristics. A public beta test was planned for summer 2006. The final release date was set at the end of 2006. The same day, McAfee announced Falcon, a security suite with similar functionalities as Norton 360 and OneCare. However, those dates were delayed. OneCare was launched in summer 2006 while Falcon entered public beta testing. Some viewed Norton 360 as a response to Microsoft's antivirus software, OneCare. However, with the release of OneCare, some saw Symantec as lagging behind its rivals. Mark Bregman, Symantec's vice president, claimed the upcoming Norton 360 was not intended to compete with OneCare, stating \\"We somehow left the wrong impression in the market place that there's Windows Live OneCare from Microsoft, there's Falcon from McAfee, and there's nothing from Symantec.\\" The first public beta was delivered in November 2006, compatible with Windows XP. A second beta was subsequently released December 20, 2006, adding compatibility for Windows Vista build 6000. After 100,000 people tested the software, Symantec began distribution to retailers in February 2007. ===Version 1.0=== Norton 360 version 1.0 box art Version 1.0 was released on February 26, 2007. This version was the first Symantec product to use SONAR to detect zero-day viruses. It monitors applications for malicious behavior, taking action as needed. The backup and restore functionality allowed users to back up files online or to a hard drive, CD, or DVD. Performance optimization tools allowed users to clear web browser history and temporary files. A disk defragmenter was bundled as part of the optimization tools. Phishing protection integrates with Internet Explorer, warning users of fraudulent sites. In Windows XP, a 300 megahertz processor, 256 megabytes of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required. Under Vista, an 800 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required. Reviews cited Norton 360's low resource usage, relative to Norton Internet Security 2007, and phishing protection. PC Magazine found the phishing protection feature to be more effective at blocking access to fraudulent sites than Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2. However, reviewers highlighted the lack of manual control for advanced users. CNET noted the lack of phishing protection for browsers other than Internet Explorer, such as Mozilla Firefox. CNET also highlighted the lack of wireless network tools, such as notifying users when someone uninvited joins the network or help encrypting wireless signals. PC Magazine criticized the antispam filter of Version 1.0, finding it blocked only half of the spam mail, and with five percent false positive rate. ===Version 2.0=== Version 2.0 was released March 3, 2008. The backup feature can now inscribe data to Blu-ray and HD DVD discs. Multiple installations of Norton 360 can also be managed from a centralized location. When backing up files online, the user can control the amount of bandwidth Norton uses. A registry cleaner is bundled with the performance tools, allowing the user to remove invalid entries. Phishing protection for Firefox was added. Supplementing the phishing protection is the Norton Identity Safe, which stores login credentials to websites. A network map allows users to view the status of other Norton installations on networked computers and view basic information about each computer. System requirements remain the same as version 1.0. PC Magazine found the spam filter to be inaccurate, with a 25 percent false positive rate. CNET encountered problems when installing version 2.0 on legacy machines. ===Version 3.0=== Norton 360 version 3.0 box art Version 3.0 was released on March 4, 2009. This version uses the same codebase as Norton Internet Security 2009. For earlier versions, Symantec rewrote code specifically for Norton 360. Version 3.0 incorporates Norton Safe Web, offered as a standalone service earlier. Safe Web integrates with Firefox and Internet Explorer as a toolbar, blocking access to fraudulent and malware hosting sites. This toolbar also includes a search box, routing search queries typed in the box through the Ask.com search engine. The toolbar does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar, which was classified as spyware by McAfee, Trend Micro, and other antivirus vendors. Due to criticism of the search functionality, Symantec announced the Ask.com search box would be hidden in future releases of version 3.0. The capability to back up files to a flash drive was introduced in this release. Files stored on a flash drive can be copied to another computer without Norton 360 installed. Norton also creates a virtual drive in Windows Explorer, allowing users to browse their backup files, stored locally or online. Users can restore individual files using the drag-and-drop technique. Version 3.0 does not retain previous versions of files and skips files which are open by another program. A startup application manager was included in this release, allowing users to control which programs start at login. To complement the application manager, Norton can measure the impact programs have on login time. PC Magazine highlighted version 3.0's inaccurate spam filter, misfiling half of valid mail as spam. PC Magazine also noted a support session with a Symantec technician who used the shareware application Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to remove malware from a computer, referring to it as an \\"online Norton program\\". Controversy was raised over the fact the technician misleadingly referred to the program as a Symantec product. === Version 4.0 === Version 4.0 was released on February 17, 2010. This version adds many new security features found in Norton Internet Security 2010. Version 4 also features a GUI change. The prominent colors now match the gold and black sunburst of Norton Internet Security. The widely criticized antispam has been replaced with the far more effective Brightmail, which according to Symantec gives 20% better results and require no training.Symantec uses BrightMail to filter out SPAM with Norton 2010 === Version 5.0 === Version 5.0 was released in February 2011 and offers improved performance and virus detection. It also provides updated versions of SONAR (version 3) and System insight. Download Insight now not only supports Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers only, but also supports the following clients: QQ (Chat), MSN Messenger (Chat), Limewire (P2P), MSN Explorer (Browser, E-mail & Chat), Opera (Browser), Outlook (E-mail), Thunderbird (E-mail), Windows Mail (E-mail), Chrome (Browser), BitTorrent (P2P), AOL (Browser), Yahoo Messenger (Chat), Safari (Browser), FileZilla (File Manager), Outlook Express (E-mail). It features a new and enhanced interface with more realistic icons and animations and it also includes Norton Widgets - a platform that integrates other Symantec online services directly in the UI. Also new for this version are Reputation scan, that gives the user clear insight of the loaded applications and files and the Safeweb for Facebook, which scans the links on the wall to verify their safety. Links to Norton Recovery Tools have been added in the scanner's interface and in the start menu folder to help in restoring a highly infected system. The backup and restore functionality has also been improved. Passmark performance test 011 rated Norton 360 5.0 as the fastest and lightest all-in-one suite. ===Version 6.0=== Featured Metered Broadband modes, and easily remembers logins and other personal info while protecting against online identity theft. ===Version-Less (unofficially 7.0 or 2013) 20.0=== This version of Norton was released on September 5, 2012, together with the newest Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products. It was described as Version-Less in Symantec's press release alluding to automatic updates that always keep the software to its latest version. There is no specific version reference anywhere in the description of the software. The software is compatible with Windows 8. This version of Norton 360 features enhancements in social networking protection, anti-scam capabilities, and stronger networking defenses. Norton also introduced the extra tune up disk optimizer. ===Version 21 (2014)=== Version 21 of Norton's security suite was released on September 4, 2013, together with the newest Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security products. Norton 360 is an antivirus solution developed on SONAR technology, which claims to be able to detect any threat, block it, and remove it, thanks to three out of five layers of shields: Threat Monitoring, Threat Removal, and Network Defense, the last one dealing with online threats before they can actually reach the user‚Äôs computer. Protection is also granted through analyzing the behavior of known menaces. Another important aspect derives from stealth capabilities, as the five shields work silently in the background, performing scans, updates and back-ups automatically with no need whatsoever to care for important files. Browser Protection and Download Insight have a keen eye for dangerous applications, warning the user about eventual threats before running them on the computer. ===Version 22 (2015)=== Version 22 was released on September 22, 2014. This release was marketed as Norton Security 2015, however Norton 360 users are able to update to v22, even when Norton is retiring the Norton 360 brand. The appearance of the software is identical to Norton Security 2015, except for the product name in the top- left corner. === Norton 360 (2019) === In April 2019, the Norton 360 brand was revived to replace Norton Security, adding Norton Secure VPN, 10 GB of online backup per-user, as well as premium plans incorporating LifeLock identity theft protection. ==Norton 360 Editions== Norton 360 is available as Norton 360 (standard), Norton 360 Premier Edition, and Norton 360 Multi-Device. The Premier Edition has all the functions of the standard edition, with the difference that it comes with 25 GB of online storage versus 2 GB which is included with the standard edition. Norton 360 Multi-Device is actually three products in one subscription: Norton 360 Premier Edition, Norton Internet Security for Mac¬Æ, and Norton Mobile Security. The comparison between Norton 360 editions and Norton One shows all of the features and OS coverage. Norton 360- Gold Edition credit card type with 5 unique sets of alpha-numeric key data on reverse is sold with the instructions to go online and install on the installation page. Norton 360 software is not sold; it is a purchased subscription for a stated period (e.g. one year). The software (e.g. firewall, antivirus) is automatically disabled at the end of the subscription period, unless a new subscription is purchased. A special edition of Norton 360 Premier Edition, branded Norton Security Suite, is available for free to PC customers of Comcast Xfinity internet service. The only difference between Norton 360 Premier Edition and Norton Security Suite is the latter does not include any online storage feature. (Norton Internet Security for Mac is also available free for Comcast Xfinity customers.) Major version updates to Norton Security Suite typically occur about 1 month or more after Norton 360. ==Windows 8 Consumer Preview compatibility== Windows 8 consumer preview was released on February 29, 2012. Symantec announced that Norton AntiVirus and Internet Security, as well as the newest Norton 360 version 6 will be compatible with Windows 8.Norton is Windows 8 compatible according to Symantec. ==Disadvantages of older versions before 3.0FBI cooperation=== Symantec, in compliance with the FBI, whitelisted Magic Lantern, a keylogger developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on November 20, 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press.Ted Bridis. \\"FBI Develops Eavesdropping Tools,\\" Washington Post, November 22, 2001. Magic Lantern is deployed as an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, a trojan horse is installed on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law. Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said \\"We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn‚Äôt know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party\\". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, \\"Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools.\\" FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, \\"Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process.\\" Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike Carnivore, a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order. ===Uninstallation=== Norton Internet Security (Windows versions) is criticized for not uninstalling completely, leaving unnecessary files and registry entries. Versions prior to 3.0 also installed a separate LiveUpdate program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton- branded products, if present. Symantec has developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove registry keys and values along with files and folders. The uninstaller must be run twice: initially, then again after a computer restart, requiring a second restart. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, which is preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies. ===Windows Service Packs=== When Norton 360 version 2.0 is installed, users have encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid Windows Registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility. Dave Cole, senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done \\"extensive testing\\" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue was not encountered. Cole blamed Microsoft \\"This is related to XP SP3.\\" Microsoft recommended for users to contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is available from Symantec. ===Windows Vista=== Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of an operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits may hide in an operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, \\"The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous\\", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions. === Subscription expiration === Norton 360 comes with a one-year subscription which is activated upon installation, and is valid for three home computers. Expiration of the subscription not only blocks access to program updates but shuts down the antivirus and the firewall as well. All the other tools, such as the bundled password manager with user saved passwords are also inaccessible. Users often do not understand that they will be completely exposed, so their PCs become infected by viruses. ==See also== *Norton Internet Security *Norton AntiVirus ==References== ==External links== *Norton 360 Homepage *Norton 360 Category:Antivirus software Category:Firewall software Category:Backup software Category:Symantec software ","title":"Norton 360"},{"id":"9104592","text":"Panaeolina is a small genus of small mushrooms, containing only about four species. They are a subgroup of Panaeolus which have dark brown spores. The type species is Panaeolina foenisecii, a common lawn mushroom. Members of Panaeolina are broadly distributed throughout the world. Some members of Panaeolina have been reported to contain the hallucinogen psilocybin, however these results are thought to be false positives. These fungi are sometimes classified as part of the genus Panaeolus.See Mushroom expert page on Panaeolus foenisecii, which gives further references which use both these naming choices. Like that genus their gills have a cloudy/speckled/mottled appearance due to the way that their spores ripen unevenly in spots, but they are distinguished because the spores are ornamented while those of Panaeolus (in the restricted sense) are smooth. Also their gills are dark brown, instead of black or grey.Courtecuisse, R. & Duhem, B.

C. Macready's production of The Tempest in 1838 and \\"fairy\\" burlesques at Covent Garden Theatre. Later, she was known, along with her husband, Thomas German Reed, for creating the family-friendly German Reed Entertainments. There, she was a mentor to W. S. Gilbert, and her performances inspired Gilbert to create some of his famous contralto roles. ==Life and careerEarly years=== Horton was born in Birmingham. Her parents were Thomas Horton and Barbara, n√©e Westwater. She performed on the stage in London from the age of ten, when she played the Gipsy Girl in Guy Mannering at the Surrey Theatre.Stedman, Jane W. \\"Reed, (Thomas) German (1817‚Äì1888)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 13 November 2008 The next year, Horton sang at Vauxhall Gardens. In 1830, she appeared at Covent Garden Theatre as Mealey Mouth in Harlequin, Pat, and Bat. In 1834, at the Royal Victorian Theatre, Horton played Julia in a musical adaptation of Guy Mannering, Kate in Sheridan Knowles's melodrama The Beggar's Daughter of Bethnal Green, Romeo, Desdemona in Othello, and Oscar in Gustavus the Third. In 1837, she joined in W. C. Macready's company at Covent Garden Theatre. There she played Mopsa in The Winter's Tale, the Boy in Henry V, and the Fool in King Lear. After other successful roles, Horton played Ariel in Macready's production of The Tempest in 1838 at Covent Garden. Drawing of Priscilla German Reed in both the parts she played in an 1857 double bill: the title roles in The Flower-boy and The Scotch Fisher-girl\\" Blonde and blue eyed, Horton had sometimes played in \\"trouser roles\\", which, by the time Horton entered the profession, had lost much of their risqu√© aura. She was a favourite of James Planch√©, Charles DickensExample of a poem and drawing by Charles Dickens for Horton and Madame Vestris and was known for her agile dancing and clear contralto singing voice. The historian Paul Buczkowski wrote of her, \\"Horton brought a lively intelligence to her roles, and was almost as highly lauded in tragedy (for instance, as Ophelia in Hamlet and the Fool in King Lear) as in comedy. She would appear in most of Planch√©'s later works, substantially enriching them.\\"Buczkowski, Paul. \\"J. R. Planch√©, Frederick Robson, and the Fairy Extravaganza\\", Marvels & Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 15, No. 1 (2001), pp. 42‚Äì65 From 1840 to 1847, Horton joined Benjamin Nottingham Webster's company at the Haymarket Theatre, where she first played Ophelia in 1840. The Athenaeum wrote: \\"The only striking novelty in the performance is the Ophelia of Miss P. Horton, which approaches very nearly to the wild pathos of the original in one scene, and is touching and beautiful in all.\\"The Athenaeum, 21 March 1840, p. 238 The same year, she created the role of Georgina Vesey in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Money. In 1842, she sang the role of Acis in Handel's Acis and Galatea. At the Haymarket Theatre from 1843‚Äì47, she appeared in many of her Planch√© Christmas and Easter pieces. During these years, she also appeared at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane as Philidel in Henry Purcell's opera King Arthur (1842) and created the girl/boy roles of Myrtina/Fortunio in Planch√©'s Fortunio and his Seven Gifted Servants (1843). ===Marriage and later years=== She married Thomas German Reed in 1844. From 1847‚Äì54, she continued to play roles at the Haymarket, Drury Lane and Olympic theatres as well as in provincial tours. One 1851 role was Hecate in Macready's farewell Macbeth. Priscilla German Reed, mid-1860s In the spring of 1855, the German Reeds presented the first performance of \\"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings,\\" musical theatre performances usually consisting of one or two brief comic operas designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and harmonium or a small ensemble of musicians. These soon became \\"Mr. And Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\\", presented at the Royal Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street (and later at St. George's Hall). To help lend respectability to their family-friendly entertainments, they called their establishment the \\"Gallery\\" of Illustration, rather than a \\"theatre\\", and the pieces they put on were called \\"entertainments,\\" rather than plays, extravaganzas, or burlesques, to interest family audiences who were afraid of the bad reputation in which the professional theatre was regarded at the time. The entertainments focused on satire and \\"clean\\" comedy, eschewing any hint of the vulgarity that permeated the London stage. Reed himself composed the music for many of these pieces, and often appeared in them, together with Mrs. German Reed. Horton was a mentor to the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, who wrote six short operas for the German Reeds, each with a prominent role for Horton, and these roles became the pattern for his later contralto characters in the Savoy Operas. Thomas retired in 1871, and Horton, together with their son, Alfred (1847‚Äì1895), continued the entertainments until her retirement in 1879, when Alfred took over their production until 1895. She retired from performing in 1879. She died at the age of 77 at Bexley Heath, Kent. ==Notes== == References == * * ==External links== *Description of an \\"Illustrative Gathering\\" *Planche site with information about Mrs. German Reed *A chronology with some information about Mrs. German Reed *Photos of Mrs. German Reed *Encyclopedia entry about the German Reeds *Description of Horton and her performances *Information about St George's Hall, including reviews of Mrs. Reed's performances Category:People associated with Gilbert and Sullivan Category:English stage actresses Category:Actor-managers Category:English female singers Category:1818 births Category:1895 deaths Category:19th-century English actresses Category:19th-century English singers Category:19th-century women singers Category:19th-century theatre managers Category:19th-century English businesswomen Category:19th-century English businesspeople ","title":"Priscilla Horton"},{"id":"9104675","text":"Asaf Hanuka (; born 1974) is an Israeli illustrator and comic book artist, notable for his autobiographical comic The Realist.

He has worked in both Malayalam cinema and Kannada cinema. His directorial ventures were chiefly with Kannada films. His popularity also is largely as a director rather than a cinematographer due to his many popular films in Kannada, some of which went on to become blockbusters. ==CareerCinematographer=== His career in cinema started as a cinematographer. He stood behind the camera for noted Malayalam films like Dhruvam, King, Ullasa Poonkattu and the blockbuster movie Commissioner which was instrumental in raising Suresh Gopi, currently a superstar in Malayalam movie world to stardom. Great talent in cinematography was the springboard that launched him to great success in the world of cinema. This also helped him to have first hand knowledge of every technical aspect of cinema, which a director need not be necessarily familiar with. He also directed a Malayalam film named Mazhavillu starring Kunchacko Boban and Preeti Jhangiani. Although his camera skills were widely appreciated in Mollywood, his ambition took him to the world of Kannada films where he chose to direct rather than handle the camera. ===Director=== His directorial career in the Kannada film world took off with a hugely successful thriller Idu Saadhya in 1989. The movie, featuring eight stars, was actually made on a shoestring budget of just 1.5 million INR and shot at a single location within 48 hours.https://web.archive.org/web/20080214153031/http://www.cscsarchive.org/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/E9447519F20B26DF65256941001E4B68?OpenDocument It set a Guinness record of fastest completion of an Indian film. A drama theatre where the film was shot mingles into the theme and almost becomes a character of the movie. Idhu Sadhya became a trend setter because of its brilliant direction, screenplay and cinematography. His inspiration for this film came from the theme of Michele Soavi's Deliria (film). (Stagefright) must also have been an influencing factor for this film. Suprabhatha is another major success of Dinesh Baboo. The story revolves around a single location, this time, a gas filling station. A film with Super Star Dr.Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini, became a box office looter creating many records and gave a major boost to the career of Dinesh babu. As a director, his craftsmanship has been lauded by columnists and reviewers. ===Actor=== He is appearing in front of camera for the first time as a Police officer in the film Accident which is Directed by Ramesh Aravind. ==Personal life== Dinesh Baboo had a failed marriage and had divorced his first wife.

There are also surgeons in podiatry, dentistry, orthodontics, and the veterinary medicine. ==History== Al-Zahrawi, the Islamic Golden Age physician widely considered one of the '\\"Fathers of Modern Surgery\\" The first person to document a surgery was the 6th Century BC Indian physician-surgeon, Sushruta. He specialized in cosmetic plastic surgery and even documented an operation of open rhinoplasty.Ira D. Papel, John Frodel, Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery His magnum opus Su≈õruta-sa·πÉhitƒÅ is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of both Ayurveda and surgery. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Su≈õruta \\"the father of surgical intervention\\" on account of the extraordinarily accurate and detailed accounts of surgery to be found in the work. After the eventual decline of the Sushruta School of Medicine in India, surgery was largely ignored until the Islamic Golden Age surgeon Al-Zahrawi (936-1013), re-established surgery as an effective medical practice. He is considered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the Islamic World, and has also been described as the father of surgery. His greatest contribution to medicine is the Kitab al- Tasrif, a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices. He was the first physician to describe an ectopic pregnancy, and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of h√¶mophilia. His pioneering contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an enormous impact on surgery but it was not until the eighteenth century that surgery emerged as a distinct medical discipline in England. In Europe, surgery was mostly associated with barber-surgeons who also used their hair-cutting tools to undertake surgical procedures, often at the battlefield and also for their employers. With advances in medicine and physiology, the professions of barbers and surgeons diverged; by the 19th century barber-surgeons had virtually disappeared, and surgeons were almost invariably qualified doctors who had specialized in surgery. Surgeon continued, however, to be used as the title for military medical officers until the end of the 19th century, and the title of Surgeon General continues to exist for both senior military medical officers and senior government public health officers. ==Titles in the Commonwealth== In 1950, the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) in London began to offer surgeons a formal status via RCS membership. The title Mister became a badge of honour, and today, in many Commonwealth countries, a qualified doctor who, after at least four years' training, obtains a surgical qualification (formerly Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, but now also Member of the Royal College of Surgeons or a number of other diplomas) is given the honour of being allowed to revert to calling themselves Mr, Miss, Mrs or Ms in the course of their professional practice, but this time the meaning is different. It is sometimes assumed that the change of title implies consultant status (and some mistakenly think non-surgical consultants are Mr too), but the length of postgraduate medical training outside North America is such that a qualified surgeon may be years away from obtaining such a post: many doctors previously obtained these qualifications in the senior house officer grade, and remained in that grade when they began sub-specialty training. The distinction of Mr (etc.) is also used by surgeons in the Republic of Ireland, some states of Australia, Barbados, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and some other Commonwealth countries. ==Military titles== In many English-speaking countries the military title of surgeon is applied to any medical practitioner, due to the historical evolution of the term. The US Army Medical Corps retains various surgeon MOS' in the ranks of officer pay grades for military personnel dedicated to performing surgery on wounded soldiers. ==Specialties== The Gross Clinic, 1875, Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Some physicians who are general practitioners or specialists in family medicine or emergency medicine may perform limited ranges of minor, common, or emergency surgery. Anesthesia often accompanies surgery, and anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists may oversee this aspect of surgery. Surgeon's assistant, surgical nurses, surgical technologists are trained professionals who support surgeons. In the United States, the Department of Labor description of a surgeon is \\"a physician who treats diseases, injuries, and deformities by invasive, minimally-invasive, or non-invasive surgical methods, such as using instruments, appliances, or by manual manipulation\\". ==Pioneer surgeons== Russian surgeon Nikolay Pirogov - a pioneer of field surgery Victor Horsley pioneered neurosurgery * Sushruta (the first to document an operation of open rhinoplasty) * al-Zahrawi, regarded as one of the greatest medieval surgeons and a father of surgery.A.

The picture, which featured appearances by Eddie Foy, Jr., Lila Lee, and George Raft, is now considered a lost film.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p. 14 A still existing vintage movie trailer of this film displays no clip of the feature. ==Plot== After working as a hostess for Nick and Andy, Tex Malone leaves their employ and opens a club of her own. Looking for talent to book for the floor show, Tex hires Bee Walters and thereby breaks up Bee's act with Eddie Parr. Andy spitefully kills Tex's friend, Holland, and young Eddie is arrested for the crime on circumstantial evidence. Tex then learns from Eddie's father, Phil, that Eddie is her long-lost son. At the trial, Tex comes to Eddie's defense and persuades one member of the jury that there is reasonable doubt of Eddie's guilt. The jury repairs to Tex's club, where Tex discovers a piece of evidence that conclusively links Andy with the murder. Eddie is freed, and Tex and Phil get together for a second honeymoon. ==Cast== *Texas Guinan as Texas Malone *John Davidson as Don Holland *Lila Lee as Bea Walters *Arthur Housman as Andy Quinland *Eddie Foy, Jr. as Eddie Parr *Jack Norworth as Phil Parr *George Raft as Gigola *Jimmy Phillips as Nick *William B.

Warner Bros signed Guinan to make the film on 15 August 1928. Jack Norwood, John Davidson and Eddie Foy were signed to support her. Filming started in September 1928. Guinan had recently toured Los Angeles. According to George Raft's obituary, Raft made his movie debut in the film as a dancer, but his scenes were cut from the final film. However Variety did a review which said \\"nite club scene introduces George Raft, the hot' stepper, as the m. c.and band leader, being brought down for one of his rip-snorting hoofing specialties.\\" Filming started September 1928. In finished by November. ==Reception== The film was generally reviewed as mediocre by critics. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it \\"a somewhat entertaining thriller\\", though he found the ending \\"amateurishly forced\\". Variety wrote, \\"Tex hasn't much to do, but does what she has pretty well... Texas Guinan and \\"Queen of the Night Clubs\\" is a double-barreled, come-on at the gate. The' ballyboo potentialities are limitless. Peasants will go for it like unexpurgated literature. \\" Film Daily called it \\"dull and uninteresting\\", writing, \\"This film was built solely to give Tex Guinan a chance to show how she runs her Broadway night club, but it has been done so often and so much better in other films of night club life that it carries no kick.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker expressed disappointment, writing, \\"Rather to our surprise and much to our regret, Miss Guinan doesn't carry the picture with as much verve as it might seem that she would.\\" ===Box office=== According to Warner Bros the film earned $459,000 domestically and $13,000 foreign. ==Preservation status== *No film elements are known to exist.

This documentary series had Cavett cover a given year out of each decade from 1917 to 1969.

Its species are resident in Africa south of the Sahara. They were previously classed as a subfamily of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. They are small stout insect-eating birds, usually found in open forests or bush. The nest is a small neat cup low in a tree or bush. They hunt by flycatching, or by taking prey from the ground like a shrike. Batis species are strikingly patterned, typically with a grey crown, black eye mask, dark back, and paler underparts, often with a coloured or black breast band and white on the throat which contrasts strongly with the black eye stripe. Male and female plumages usually differ. The song is typically a descending triple whistle. ==Taxonomy== The genus Batis was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1833. The type species was subsequently designated as the Cape batis. The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek batis, batidos, an unidentified worm-eating bird mentioned by Aristotle. The genus contains 19 species. * Rwenzori batis, Batis diops * Margaret's batis, Batis margaritae * Forest batis, Batis mixta * Reichenow's batis, Batis reichenowi * Dark batis, Batis crypta * Cape batis, Batis capensis * Woodward's batis, Batis fratrum * Chinspot batis, Batis molitor * Senegal batis, Batis senegalensis * Grey- headed batis, Batis orientalis * Pale batis, Batis soror * Pririt batis, Batis pririt * Eastern black-headed batis, Batis minor * Western black-headed batis, Batis erlangeri * Pygmy batis, Batis perkeo * Angolan batis, Batis minulla * Gabon batis, Batis minima * Ituri batis, Batis ituriensis * Fernando Po batis, Batis poensis ** West African batis, Batis poensis occulta ==References== * * Category:Platysteiridae Category:Bird genera ","title":"Batis (bird)"},{"id":"9104798","text":"In descriptive set theory, a tree over a product set Y\\\\times Z is said to be homogeneous if there is a system of measures \\\\langle\\\\mu_s\\\\mid s\\\\in{}^{<\\\\omega}Y\\\\rangle such that the following conditions hold: * \\\\mu_s is a countably-additive measure on \\\\\\\\{t\\\\mid\\\\langle s,t\\\\rangle\\\\in T\\\\\\\\} . * The measures are in some sense compatible under restriction of sequences: if s_1\\\\subseteq s_2, then \\\\mu_{s_1}(X)=1\\\\iff\\\\mu_{s_2}(\\\\\\\\{t\\\\mid t\\\\upharpoonright lh(s_1)\\\\in X\\\\\\\\})=1. * If x is in the projection of T, the ultrapower by \\\\langle\\\\mu_{x\\\\upharpoonright n}\\\\mid n\\\\in\\\\omega\\\\rangle is wellfounded.

Keagy sang lead vocals on several of their hits, such as \\"Sister Christian\\", \\"Sing Me Away\\", and \\"Sentimental Street\\". ==BiographyEarly years=== Keagy started out his career as a drummer but over the years gained experience in many aspects of the music business. The day after Kelly graduated high school, he packed his bags and left home to pursue being a full-time drummer. After years of playing the club circuit, he became the touring drummer for the San Francisco band Rubicon. Along with fellow members Jack Blades and Brad Gillis, he formed the band Night Ranger in 1979 as Stereo. ===Night Ranger=== After getting some experience with local gigs in San Francisco, promoter Bill Graham booked Night Ranger as the opening act for such bands as Judas Priest, Santana, and the Doobie Brothers. They became one of the most popular mainstream hard rock bands of the mid-1980s. Night Ranger's first album, Dawn Patrol, released in 1982, reached No. 38 on the U.S. charts and sold over 1 million copies, yet it was 1983's Midnight Madness that established the band as a commercial force. Featuring the hits \\"(You Can Still) Rock in America\\" and \\"Sister Christian\\", the record peaked at No. 15 and sold over 2 million copies. The 1985 album 7 Wishes was even more successful, reaching No. 10 on the charts and selling over 3 million copies. In 1988, keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald left Night Ranger, shortly after the recording of Man in Motion. Then, in 1989, after the Man in Motion tour, front man Jack Blades left Night Ranger, with the group disbanding. In 1991, Night Ranger reformed with Gary Moon replacing Jack Blades on bass and lead vocals. Then in 1996, the classic Night Ranger lineup of Jack Blades/Kelly Keagy/Brad Gillis/Jeff Watson/Alan Fitzgerald reunited. Fitzgerald departed in 2003, and Watson in 2007. As of 2017, Night Ranger continues to tour and record new music with the current lineup of Jack Blades, Kelly Keagy, Brad Gillis, Kerri Kelli and Eric Levy. Their most recent studio release, Don't Let Up, came out in 2017. ===The Mob=== In 2005 Keagy joined guitarist Reb Beach, vocalist Doug Pinnick and keyboardist Timothy Drury to form the group The Mob.

He then climbed with a group who called themselves the 'Bradford Lads'. When called up for National Service Gray volunteered to work as a pay clerk and was posted to Manchester, where he was able to climb with the Rock and Ice club members on a regular basis. He has climbed with some of the best British climbers of the day; Tom Patey, Don Whillans, Joe Brown, Harold Drasdo, Robin Campbell, Eli Moriarty, Nat Allen, Slim Sorrell, Ron Moseley and many more. Gray was on the first ascents of Frisco Bay at Stoney Middleton, Grond on Dinas y Gromlech, Wombat and Macabre at Malham, and North Crag Eliminate on Castle Rock. After several forays into the Alps, in 1961 Gray was invited to join a group of Derby climbers to the Kulu Himalaya, which led to the first ascent of the Manikaran Spires. In 1964 he and Don Whillans took a small expedition to Gauri Sankar, failing to reach the summit by a few hundred feet. Next in 1966 he led an expedition to film the first complete ascent of the north ridge of Alpamayo in the Andes. Five members of the team reached the summit and that the film won first prize in an International Competition. He then led the expedition which made the first ascent of Mukar Beh in the Indian Himalaya in 1968, a project which had first captured his imagination in 1961. The climb turned out to be a race against the weather, and the Monsoon broke the day after the summit was reached. He was best known as the first General Secretary of the British Mountaineering Council, a post he held for 18 years until his retirement in 1989. Two serious falls, first at Glen Nevis and then at Font, Switzerland, meant that Gray's climbing these days is less ambitious than it was.

It is a Directed-energy weapon designed to work in such a way that if an enemy missile is launched towards India, it will quickly emit powerful pulses of Relativistic electron beam and destroy the target. Unlike laser beams, it does not bore a hole in the target but thoroughly damages the on-board electronic systems. It is supposedly already operational from a hidden location, but has not been battle tested yet due to lack of such situations that would force India to publicly acknowledge its operational existence. Scientists say that it can potentially be used as a beam weapon. Bursts of microwaves packed with gigawatts of power produced by this machine, when aimed at enemy missiles and aircraft will cripple their electronic system and computer chips and bring them down right away. ==Overview== The Kali is a particle accelerator. It emits powerful pulses of electrons (Relativistic Electron Beams- REB). Other components in the machine down the line convert the electron energy into EM Radiation, which can be adjusted to x-ray (as Flash X-Rays) or microwave (High Power Microwave) frequencies. This has fueled hopes that the KALI could, one day be used in a High-Power Microwave gun, which could destroy incoming missiles and aircraft through soft-kill (destroying the electronic circuitry on the missile). However, weaponising such a system has many obstacles to overcome. ==History== The project was first Founded by Dr. P.H. Ron, and mooted in 1985 by the then Director of the BARC, Dr. R. Chidambaram. Work on the Project began in 1989, being developed by the Accelerators & Pulse Power Division of the BARC. (Dr. Chidambaram was also the Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister, and the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission). DRDO is also involved with this project. It was initially developed for industrial applications, although defence applications became clearer later. The first accelerators had a power of ~0.4GW, which increased as later versions were developed. These were the KALI 80, KALI 200, KALI 1000, KALI 5000 and KALI 10000. The KALI-5000 was commissioned for use in late 2004.BARC Director's speech on October 29 2004 celebrating Dr. Homi Bhabha's 95th Birth Anniversary ==Applications== The KALI has been put to various uses by the DRDO. The DRDO was involved in configuring the KALI for their use. The X-rays emitted are being used in Ballistics research as an illuminator for ultrahigh speed photography by the Terminal Ballistics Research Institute (TBRL) in Chandigarh. The Microwave emissions are used for EM Research. The microwave-producing version of KALI has also been used by the DRDO scientists for testing the vulnerability of the electronic systems of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), which was then under development. It has also helped in designing electrostatic shields to \\"harden\\" the LCA and missiles from microwave attack by the enemy as well as protecting satellites against deadly Electromagnetic Impulses (EMI) generated by nuclear weapons and other cosmic disturbances, which \\"fry\\" and destroy electronic circuits. Electronic components currently used in missiles can withstand fields of approx. 300 V/cm, while the fields in case of EMI attack reach thousands of V/cm. === As a Weapon === Weaponisation of the KALI will take some time. The system is still under development, and efforts are being made to make it more compact as well as improve its recharge time, which, at the present, makes it only a single use system. There are also issues with creating a complete system, which would require development of many more components. There have been reports of placing the weaponized KALI in an Il-76 aircraft as an airborne defence system. In the early version of 'Kali', one gigabyte of electromagnetic waves per nano second was hit. But until the last information, the latest form of 'Kali' emits up to 40 gigawatts of energy waves in 100 milliseconds. Which can destroy the enemy's biggest and sophisticated weapons in a moment. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.barc.gov.in/btdg/appd/power.html * Kali: Everything About The Secret Beam Weapon Of India Category:Particle accelerators Category:Military equipment of India Category:Defence Research and Development Organisation ","title":"KALI (electron accelerator)"},{"id":"9104886","text":"{ style=\\"margin:5px; border:1px solid #8888AA;\\" align=right cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 width=240 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor= Red colspan=2 Missouri Minutemen - align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 200 px - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Founded  2003 - align=\\"center\\"  Arena  - - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Based in  St. Joseph, Missouri - align=\\"center\\"  Colors  Red, white, and blue - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  League  American Professional Football League - align=\\"center\\"  Head coach  Ronnie Jackson } Missouri Minutemen was an indoor football team that played in the American Professional Football League (APFL).

Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade, Czechoslovakia (1949‚Äì1952), and a co-defendant in the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial in November 1952. Imprisoned by the Nazis in the Lodz ghetto and several concentration camps, he survived the Holocaust and joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party, working as an economist. The 1952 show trial involved the Communist Party General Secretary, Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω, and his thirteen co-defendants. They were arrested, unjustly accused, tried, and executed as traitors and western spies. The trial was orchestrated by Soviet advisors, sent to Prague by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and assisted by Czechoslovak Secret Service interrogators and the members of Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee. The destruction of the Czechoslovak Communist high-ranking party officials by their own colleagues has defied attempts to rationalize it, and our understanding of the affair remains superficial. One of the people who were thrown into the alleged conspiracy was Dr Rudolf Margolius. The Sl√°nsk√Ω group consisted of many personalities. On one side was Sl√°nsk√Ω, an extremist and one of those who helped to usher Czechoslovakia into the Stalinist era. At the centre stood Vladim√≠r Clementis (Minister of Foreign Affairs), a Communist and one of the conductors of the February 1948 communist coup, but also a man who had dared to criticize the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. On the other extreme of the scale was Margolius. Unlike others in the Sl√°nsk√Ω group, he joined the Communist Party late ‚Äì in December 1945 ‚Äì and acquired faith in socialism as a result of his experience in Adolf Hitler‚Äôs concentration campsIgor Lukes (2002): Rudolf Margolius: A Clean Man in a Filthy Time, Boston University 2002 and never held any Party appointments, he was purely an economist.Heda Margoliov√° Kov√°lyov√° a Helena T≈ôe≈°t√≠kov√°: Hitler, Stalin a j√°: √östn√≠ historie 20. stolet√≠, Mlad√° fronta, Praha, 2015, p. 176, ==Life== Rudolf Margolius was born in Prague into a patriotic Czech, middle-class milieu. As a law student in the thirties at Charles University, studying together with the Czech poet Hanu≈° Bonn, he devoted much of his time to the YMCA travelling in Western Europe, Middle East and America. During Czechoslovakia‚Äôs Munich crisis with Nazi Germany he was an Army reservist serving together with his friend, music composer, Jan Hanu≈°. In 1939, while Czechoslovakia was already occupied by the Third Reich, he married Heda Bloch (later known as Heda Margolius Kov√°ly). In 1941 he was deported to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto and subsequently to concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. In May 1945 after escaping from Dachau, he was made a leader of the Garmisch-Partenkirchen camp for the war refugees. After returning to Prague in June 1945 together with Jarmila ƒåapkov√° Margolius went to Bergen-Belsen to search for Josef ƒåapek.Jarmila ƒåapkov√°, Vzpom√≠nky, Torst, Praha 1998, p. 331. In December 1945 he joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party influenced by his war experiences and murder of his parents and relatives in the concentration camps and hope of instituting better future for the country. Between 1945 and 1948 he worked for the Central Federation of Czechoslovak Industry in Prague. Afterwards he was promoted to the Chief of Staff of the Minister for Foreign Trade (1948‚Äì49) and subsequently became Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade responsible for the sector trading with Western countries (1949‚Äì52). Together with his colleague, Ev≈æen L√∂bl, Margolius was the author of dollar offensive in the Czechoslovak economic policy. In 1949 in London Margolius negotiated and signed several important economic and financial agreements with Ernest Bevin and Sir William Strang who represented the British Government. The agreements through Margolius' effort were weighted in favour of the Czechoslovak trade rather than the British trade.https://soldan.blog.sme.sk/c/228307/Platba-za-krv-II-diel- obdobie-1945-1982.html?ref=viacblogerJan Kukl√≠k, Do posledn√≠ pence, Karolinum, Praha 2007, , pp.243-298 Czechoslovak government was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations and requested that the effort of all those who had participated would be appreciated.Jan Kukl√≠k, Do posledn√≠ pence, Karolinum, Praha 2007, , pp.286 Margolius was a lawyer and economist and was not directly involved in the contemporary Communist Party machinations or politics.Ivan Margolius, Reflections of Prague: Journeys through the 20th Century, Wiley, Chichester 2006, p. 160 Dr. Rudolf Margolius was arrested on January 10, 1952. After months of physical and psychological coercion in addition to being forced to sign a false confession, Margolius met for the first time his alleged co-inspirators led by Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω at the Czechoslovak High Court attached to the Pankr√°c Prison in Prague in November 1952. Margolius was chosen as a member of the ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô because in his capacity as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Foreign Trade he made trade agreements with capitalist countries against the wishes of the Soviet Union to increase trade with other socialist countries and he dealt with large sums of money. These details had a great impact on contemporary public opinion. As had been determined in advance in Moscow and by the Czechoslovak Communist Party‚Äôs Central Committee, the court sentenced Margolius and ten others to death, three received life sentences. The Times on November 28, 1952 commented: \\"The only surprising aspect...is that Margolius...is not among those who have been given the reduced penalty.\\" On December 3, 1952, at the execution, Margolius did not pronounce any last words. Pavel Tigrid wrote: \\"Margolius‚Ä¶ survived the Nazi concentration camps and after the war enrolled into the Communist Party from the real conviction: that never again would be repeated what had happened in the past, that no one would be persecuted for his or hers racial, national or social origins, in order for all people to be equal, in order to establish an era of real freedom. A couple of years later the comrades succeeded in what the Nazis had not managed: they killed him.\\"Pavel Tigrid, Kapesn√≠ pr≈Øvodce inteligentn√≠ ≈æeny po vlastn√≠m osudu, 68 Publishers, Toronto 1988, p. 97. ==Posthumous exoneration== The Scotsman reported on 16 May 1968: > Czechoslovak President Ludv√≠k Svoboda has awarded the Order of the Republic > posthumously to Rudolf Margolius, former Deputy Foreign Trade Minister > executed in 1952 after the Stalinist Sl√°nsk√Ω trial.

He served as Chief Minister of the Indian state of Odisha. He was a freedom fighter who participated in the Non-cooperation Movement , Civil Disobedience movement and Peasants movement. ==Early life== Nabakrushna Choudhuri was born to Gokulananda Choudhuri at the village of Kherasa, Jagatsinghpur District, Odisha. His father belonged to a zamindaar family and was an accomplished advocate. Nabakrushna studied at the Pyari Mohan Academy, Cuttack. He completed his studies for to Matriculation Examination at the age of 15 but had to wait for a year due to age restriction. In 1917, joined the Ravenshaw College, Cuttack. His brother Gopabandhu Choudhuri resigned from British government service to work in social service. Also later that year Bolshevik revolution happened. These events had an influence. In 1921 he left the Ravenshaw College along with few of his classmates, e.g. Nityananda Kanungo, Loknath Patnaik, Jadumani Mangaraj and Harekrushna Mahtab to join non-cooperation movement and to work in social service . He lost his father around this time so he came under his elder brother Gopabandhu Choudhury's guardianship. In 1922, Nabakrushna Choudhuri went to Gandhiji's Sabarmati ashram, Ahmedabad to learn all about Khadi ‚Äì the principles and philosophy of spinning and weaving. On return from Sabarmati, Nabakrushna tried to organize Gandhian programs in Odisha. He along with his brother in a school at Alakashram, which was established by his brother. In 1925, Nabakrushna went to Shantiniketan further studies on instructions of Mahatma Gandhi. During his ten-month stay there, he came in contact with Malati Choudhury (n√©e Sen), whom he married later. After their wedding Nabakrushna Choudhuri and Malati Choudhury went to stay at Tarikund, a village near Jagatsinghpur. Nabakrushna worked on the land as a farmer. In 1928, their eldest daughter Uttara was born. They were involved in literacy and adult education of the villagers besides agriculture while at Tarikund. ==Indian Freedom Movement== Mahatma Gandhi started Salt Satyagraha in 1930. Inchudi in Odisha was epicenter of the movement in Odia speaking regions. Srijang was equally active in another area ‚Äì the movement against payment of Tax for Chowkidari. Nabababu was the frontline leader in this movement, for which he was jailed for four months. He used the prison time in studies and in organising games and gymnastics for his fellow prisoners. In 1931 a son was born to him and Malati Devi. By that time his brother and his family were jailed as well. All of them were transferred to Hazaribag Jail. Nabababu got the opportunity of meeting fellow freedom fighters Minoo Masani, Ashok Mehta, Yusuf Mehrali and Jayaprakash Narayan . He came back to Tarikund after being released from Hazaribag Jail. He created a small group within the Congress and began editing and publishing a journal named ‚ÄòSarathi‚Äô. For meeting the recurring costs of ‚ÄòSarathi‚Äô, Malati Devi sold her jewelry . ‚ÄòSarathi‚Äô was the mouthpiece of small farmers and labourers. When the Congress Socialist Party was formed in India with Ram Manohar Lohia, Acharya Narendra Dev and Jayaprakash Narayan as its founders, Nabababu's group was merged in this forming Utkal Congress Samyabadi Sangha (Utkal Congress Socialist Party) . In 1935 Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi set up Navajuga Sahitya Sansad to create progressive literature in Odisha .This society functioned as the cultural wing of the UCSP . ===Entry into politics=== Odisha became a separate linguistic province on the first of April 1936. In 1937, elections to the Odisha provincial Legislative Assembly were held for the first time. Nabababu stood for election against Rai Bahadur Chintamani Acharya from the Tirtal-Ersama constituency. He won the election with an overwhelming majority and this marked his entry into active politics. As an MLA, he was always sensitive to, and concerned about, the interests of the poor and downtrodden in Odisha. All the farmers of Odisha united themselves to fight against the landlords who were exploiting them. His published journal ‚ÄòSarathi‚Äô had closed down by then. established another journal titled ‚ÄòKrusak‚Äô about news and features on the problems of the farmers, labourers and those of the Praja Andolan movement in the princely States. ===Praja Mandal Movement=== There were had 26 Odia speaking Princely States. The Ruling Chiefs of these states were directly responsible for their respective States according their own whims and fancies, by paying a royalty to the British. The Congress Party and Mahatma Gandhi specifically had a policy of non-interference in the internal matters of the princely States. However a section of congress did not agree with this. Chowdhuri was one such figure and he disobeyed this policy directive. Malati Devi, Harmohan Patnaik, Gouranga Charan Das and Sarangadhar Das joined him in mobilizing resistance against the princely States. At their instance there was a stiff resistance against the princely State of Nilgiri. He was joined by Harmohan Patnaik, the President of Dhenkanal Prajamandal, the first Praja Mandal in India to fight against rulers of Princely States, Gouranga Charan Das, Ananta Pattanayak, Baidyanath Rath, Sachi Routray, Manmohan Mishra, Surendranath Dwivedy etc. They went from door to door in the villages around Dhenkanal raising awareness about the opprressive regimes. In 1938, he was again imprisoned for his involvement in the Praja Mandal Movement. One of the turning point of the Prajamandal movement was the sacrifice of 12-year-old Baji Raut along with Hurushi, Nata, Raghu, Guri and Lakshman succumbed to the bullets of Dhenkanal forces.After this atrocity Nabababu further accelerated the movement from their base at Angul. During this troubled times they had their third child, a daughter named Krishna in January 1939,. In 1940, at the instance of Gandhiji, Nabababu was jailed for six months as an individual Satyagrahi. ===Quit India Movement=== On 8 August 1942, Gandhiji launched the Quit India Movement. There were mass arrests of important leaders of the movement before the next morning. Nabakrushna had already prepared a blueprint for sustaining the fight before going to prison. He was kept in succession at Cuttack, Angul and Puri Jails where he was mingling with all the fellow prisoners, and was organizing them against the misdeeds of the Jail employees. He was sent to Berhampur Jail from Puri Jail. On 26 January 1944, some young prisoners hoisted the National Flag. The Jail and Police personnel tried their best to bring down the Flag, but it was a futile effort. Eventually the matter was reported to a District British Executive, who came to the Jail for inspection, and at his orders the prisoners were mercilessly beaten resulting in injuries. Even then they resisted the efforts to dehoist the Flag. The District Executive gave firing orders. On hearing such orders , he appeared at the scene and stood still facing the gun. The British officer was afraid of him, and withdrew the firing orders. By the end of 1945, Nabababu was released from Berhampur Jail. ===Congress Government=== In the 1946 Indian provincial elections Nabababu won the from the north Kendrapara Constituency, and became a Cabinet Minister in the Harekrushna Mahatab led Indian National Congress Government having the Revenue, Supplies and Forest Departments portfolio. ==Post Independence == In the independent India, Choudhry continued as revenue minister till April 1948. As the Revenue Minister, he led the committee on 'Land Tenure and Land Revenue' . This committee recommended for the abolition of Zamindari System and other intermediaries. He also introduced Anchal Shasan system, that aimed at decentralization of local administration. He resigned from the post in the wake of his son's suicide. He continued his social work. Jawaharlal Nehru wanted that him to return to Government. He tried to persuade him, but did not succeed initially. However a series of letters exchanged between Nehru and Malati Devi suggests that ultimately he was persuaded through to become the Chief Minister of Odisha in 1950. This government resigned in 1952 February to make way for independent India's first elected government. The First general election of independent India was held in 1951‚Äì52. The Odia speaking princely states merged with the Province of Odisha (then called Orissa) and elections were held for a common legislature. Choudhury won his election as MLA from Barachana. Congress became the single largest party but short of majority.However, with support of six independent MLAs he assumed the post of Chief minister. During his Chief Minister-ship, the Zamindari system was abolished. This gave the farmers ownership right on their cultivated land. His proposal for local self government 'Anchal Shasan' became a reality. This was the precursor to the Community Development Programme launched in Odisha on the Gandhi Jayanti Day of 1952. The Hirakud Dam's construction was completed during Nabababu's Chief Ministership. In 1954, an Agriculture College and a Veterinary College were established at Bhubaneswar. An Engineering College was also established at Burla, Sambalpur. The Agriculture and Veterinary Colleges became two components of the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, which also had a Department of Architecture. Nabababu was a member of its Governing Body for many years. The Burla Engineering College became a part of the Sambalpur University. Acharya Vinoba Bhave had launched the Bhoodan and Gramdan movement when Nabababu was the Chief Minister. He was deeply involved in this movement. He was moving with Vinoba from village to village spreading the message of Gramdan. There was a flood in 1955 which was calamitous to people of Odisha. There were criticism and opposition to his handling of the crisis. Due to which he resigned as chief minister and also the primary membership of Congress. ==Work on promotion of Oriya language== Nabababu had realised for quite sometime that a people-oriented government has to use Oriya as its language for communication and administration. Therefore, he formulated rules for using Oriya in the administrative process. As an MLA, Nabababu used to speak in Oriya in the Assembly and discuss there in the same language. When the Odisha Legislative Assembly was constituted in 1946, the question of language to be used in the Assembly was raised. Lalmohan Patnaik, as the speaker, desired that English should be used as before. But Nabababu demanded that Oriya, the people's language be used instead. And his just demand was not only retained, but sustained. As mentioned elsewhere, Nabababu's decision to use Oriya as the language for communication and administration was opposed by senior officers in the administration. Nabababu passed the \\"Official Language Act, 1954\\" which required Oriya as the language to be used for administration. An Encyclopaedia of Oriya Language was prepared. Oriya typewriters were also fabricated. But all these initiatives taken by him discontinued after he left the Government in October 1956. Prime Minister Nehru persuaded him again not to leave the Chiefministership, but Nabababu was determined in his decision. For him service to the people was more important than power. ==Life After Politics== After politics he kept working in various social sectors. In 1957, he was elected as the President of the Sarva Seva Sangh. ===Diplomatic mission=== Since leaving active politics he was active in multiple diplomatic missions. Kashmir In 1959, Nabababu and Mridula Sarabhai worked as principal negotiators for Kashmir Affairs. Many Kashmiri leaders used to visit him at Angul for consultations. Around June 1959, he went to Srinagar and stayed there for quite sometime. This was a top level diplomatic mission. He used to interact with top political leaders and Military Officers. Major General H. Singh was the Liaison Officer. Assam In early sixties, the conflict between Bengali and Assamese people in Assam assumed serious proportions. Jayaprakash Narayan, Nabababu, Rama Devi Choudhury, Malati Devi and other Sarvodaya workers visited Assam to talk with the people. Situation became normal. Nagaland At this time the Nagas were organising themselves to be separated from India. There was violence and bloodshed. Even military intervention by Government could not silence the Nagas. Nabababu went there with Jayaprakash. Through the establishment of an institution named Peace Centre at Mokakchung, they talked with the people to appreciate their problems. After Jayaprakash, Nabababu became the Director of the Peace Centre. The Nagas stopped their hostile activities. Bangladeshi Refugee Crisis Another important event. Today's Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan. It was known as East Pakistan. In the name of religion, some persons of doubtful character were torturing the Hindus, who were migrating to India. Some of them came to live in Odisha. This was enough for the Hindus. To take revenge, they attacked the Muslims. It had its repercussions in Odisha. Rourkela saw killing of Hindus and Muslims. The entire country was worried. Nabababu, Rama Devi, Malati Devi and others rushed to Rourkela. They worked among both the communities till the situation became calm. ===Naxalites=== Naxalites were quite active in Koraput,Odisha . There was exploitation of the poor tribals was violently opposed by the Naxalites . The Government tried to stop this violence by force. There were reports of atrocities committed on the people by the Police. On hearing this, Nabababu and Malati Devi went there and organised meetings at different places to find out the truth. Ultimately this led to reduction of violence. The Naxalite leader, Nagabhusan Patnaik was sentenced to death for his Naxalite activities. Nabababu intervened and wrote to President Sanjeeva Reddy for pardoning Nagabhusan. Other Naxalites, who were convicted for life were also pardoned and released. ===National Emergency=== Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared National Emergency in 1975. All over the country there was expression of resistance to Emergency. During the Emergency Nabababu, Malati Devi and other leaders were imprisoned. Nabababu was sent to Baripada Jail and Malati Devi to Cuttack Jail. Nabababu became sick in Baripada Jail. He was not able to tolerate the solitary confinement. He developed partial paralysis. At his age, this was too much for him. Even then, he was enquiring about the people and their condition. His family members were very much disturbed and asked him to keep out of politics. He told them by a meaningful smile, \\" People are my life.\\" When he was slightly better, he was released on parole. The doctors put some restrictions on his movements. Malati Devi was also released from Cuttack Jail. Both of them came to Angul. Facing criticism at home and from many world leaders, Indira Gandhi withdrew the Emergency Rule paving the way for another general election . Many opposition leaders were still in jail. The opposition lacked adequate financial resources. The opposition leaders were not able to go to the people. Congress was defeated miserably. Nabababu was really happy over this. Nabababu had not fully recovered from the stroke he suffered during prison . But had kept his habit of reading books and journals. Nabababu was a voracious reader. He used to read extensively books, even the latest ones, and journals on politics, education, Marxism, Gandhian philosophy and development. Many intellectuals from abroad were visiting him to discuss about Gandhian philosophy. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy had come to look him up. ==Later Life and death== He had many bereavements earlier. His grandson and grandnephew (his brother's grandson) died of road accidents ‚Äì the former near Chowdwar, close to Cuttack, and the latter (Kabeer Chaudhury) in Indiana in USA in October 1983. He was completely shaken and for many days cried in silence! In addition to this, his anguish over the mounting selfishness of the educated few and the poverty of the common people made him more restless and sick. By mid-June 1984, Nabababu's health had further deteriorated, when the wedding of Kasturi, his granddaughter was celebrated. After the departure of Kasturi and her husband to Guwahati, the atmosphere at Bajiraut Chhatravas was rather gloomy. Nabababu died following a massive heart attack on 24 June. He was 83. ==See also== Malati Choudhury ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Indian independence activists from Odisha Category:Chief Ministers of Odisha Category:Ravenshaw University alumni Category:Visva- Bharati University alumni Category:People from Jagatsinghpur district Category:Indians imprisoned during the Emergency (India) Category:Chief ministers from Indian National Congress ","title":"Nabakrushna Choudhuri"},{"id":"9104932","text":"Zinnia acerosa is a low-growing perennial flowering plant native to the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.

Though without association to any noble ch√¢teau, the wine produced became Ch√¢teau de Gascq, quickly established in the market and served at the court of Versailles under Louis XV. By 1814, the widow of the final Gascq heir, Madame Marie Bumet de Ferri√®re, sold the property for fr 100,000 to an Englishman, Major General Charles Palmer. Having retired from military life, Palmer invested in the property over the following years, acquiring additional land and facilities. By 1831, the domain extended 163 hectares with 82 hectares under vine, buildings in Issan, Cantenac and Margaux, and had a reputation on a par with Ch√¢teau Margaux and Ch√¢teau Beychevelle. In the early 1840s, Palmer had economic difficulties which would later affect the estate's position in the 1855 Classification, and was forced to sell the property to madame Fran√ßoise- Marie Bergerac in 1843 for fr 410,000, at a substantial loss. The Ch√¢teau Palmer From 1844, during the arrival of oidium to Bordeaux, Ch√¢teau Palmer was managed by an agricultural mortgage corporation, Caisse Hypoth√©caire de Paris, until it was sold on 1853 to the P√©reire brothers, Isaac and Emile P√©reire, bankers and rivals of the Rothschilds. The P√©reires widely improved the estate but faced a difficult period of oidium, and by 1858 the entire vineyard had to be replanted. The architect Burguet was commissioned to build the present ch√¢teau constructed on 1857-1860, and by 1870 the estate extended 177 hectares, with 109 hectares under vine. The Soci√©t√© Civile P√©reire was formed in 1889, remaining proprietors until the poor economy following World War I and the Great Depression. Having sold off land during the preceding years, the final sale of the remaining estate took place in 1938. A syndicate of the Sichel, Ginestet, Mialhe and M√§hler-Besse families, forming the Soci√©t√© Civile de Ch√¢teau Palmer took control, the Sichel and M√§hler-Besse families remaining major shareholders to date. Before World War II, Ch√¢teau Palmer's owners bought Ch√¢teau Desmirail, another Third Classified Growth, and uniquely in 1963 Palmer wines were sold under the Desmirail name.

The wine produced here was classified as one of fourteen Troisi√®mes Crus (Third Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 pg. 885 ==History== Ch√¢teau Desmirail was once part of the vast Rauzan estate owned by Pierre de Mesures de Rauzan in the mid-17th century. Over time this estate was divided, and by the time of the 1855 Classification, had been separated into the estates of Ch√¢teau Rauzan-Gassies, Ch√¢teau Rauzan-S√©gla, Ch√¢teau Desmirail, and Ch√¢teau Marquis de Terme. Desmirail: The Vineyards and Wines The vineyards feature the gravelly soils that characterise the better vineyards of the left bank of the Gironde, although there are also areas of sand and clay. There are approximately 30 hectares to the estate, with vines aged over 25 years on average, these being 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, the remainder mostly Merlot at 39% and a mere 1% accounted for by Cabernet Franc. The fruit is hand-harvested before going to a sorting table positioned in the vineyard, from where it travels to the reception area where the grapes are destemmed, lightly crushed and then fermented according to the plot of origin. During the fermentation the must is pumped over to submerge the cap, and the temperature regulated to around 30¬∫C, with subsequent maceration of the solids at about two degrees below this figure. Following this the wine is run off into fresh vats for malolactic, tasting and assigning the wines to either the grand vin, Ch√¢teau Desmirail, or the second wine which goes by the name of Ch√¢teau Fontarney for the French market and Initial de Desmirail for export and for the French restaurant trade. The grand vin goes into oak for 12-18 months, with one-third of the barrels new each year; racking is performed every three months, and the fining is achieved with egg whites prior to bottling. Desmirail My experience with older vintages of Desmirail only notably looks at 1982, a wine from the very early part of the Lurton era, which was very good indeed. But this has certainly become one of the Bordeaux estates worth watching in recent years, and a number of more recent vintages I have tasted are worth considering. The 2005 and 2006 in particular have their good points, although it is the 2009 that - perhaps unsurprisingly - has made the biggest impression on me. It shows all the deliciously dark and creamy fruit of the vintage, backed up by a lovely tannic structure and good acidity. Neither the 2007 nor the 2008 were up to the level of these other vintages, nevertheless, today Desmirail continues to be an estate worth watching.

He was the first Bishop of Saginaw, serving between 1938 and his death in 1950. ==Early life and education== William Murphy was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to William and Mary (n√©e Gibson) Murphy. His parents were Irish immigrants who came to the United States from County Wexford. One of ten children, Murphy was the youngest child and only son; three of his sisters became nuns. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Augustine's Church and at Lefevre Institute in his native city. He made his collegiate studies in Ontario, Canada, at St. Jerome's College in Kitchener and at Assumption College in Sandwich. He was then sent by Bishop John Samuel Foley to study theology in Rome, where he attended the Pontifical North American College and the Urban College of Propaganda. He earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the Urban College in 1908, and a Licentiate of Canon Law from the Pontifical Athenaeum S. Apollinare in 1909. ==Priesthood== On June 13, 1908, Murphy was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro Respighi at the Basilica of St. John Lateran. He celebrated his first Mass at the tomb of Saint Peter. Upon his return to Michigan in 1910, he served as a curate at St. Thomas Church in Ann Arbor for two years. He then served at Holy Cross Church in Marine City (1912‚Äì1919) and SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Detroit (1919‚Äì1921) before becoming the founding pastor of St. David Church. In addition to his pastoral duties, Murphy served as master of ceremonies to Bishop Michael Gallagher. He was raised to the rank of a Domestic Prelate in July 1934. He also served as a member of the Michigan Historical Commission, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Detroit in 1930. In 1937, Archbishop Edward Mooney named him censor of Father Charles Coughlin, and Murphy served as intermediary between Mooney and Coughlin in negotiations about Coughlin's return to radio. ==Episcopacy== On February 26, 1938, Murphy was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Saginaw by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 17 from Archbishop Mooney, with Bishops John A. Duffy and Joseph C. Plagens serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. He selected as his episcopal motto: Agenda ademple (Latin: \\"To Fulfill One's Duties\\"). During his administration, Murphy established offices of Catholic Charities in Saginaw, Bay City, Alpena, and Bad Axe, and the Diocese of Saginaw gained a widespread reputation for social and charitable work among the poor. He also organized the Mexican Apostolate to address the spiritual concerns of Catholic migrant workers, and encouraged drives for money, food, and clothing for World War II victims in Europe. During one Christmas message, he said, \\"Christ began His mission of saving and redeeming the human race by being born in the sqaulor of a stable. He ennobled poverty.\\" He was a close friend of poet Edgar Guest with whom he often golfed and fished. It was Guest who wrote of Murphy: \\"A bishop, bass upon his hook, Rod bent and taut line swishing, Without his robe and shepherd's crook Is just a man out fishing.\\" Murphy died at age 64. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Kalamazoo, Michigan Category:Pontifical North American College alumni Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Saginaw Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"William Murphy (Bishop of Saginaw)"},{"id":"9105054","text":"The UERMMMC College of Medicine is a private medical college within the UERM Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines.

Specific changes have also been installed in its search for relevance to the national and local health needs, as well as in keeping with international trends. It put more emphasis on science and art in the teaching of all courses, in order to produce graduates who shall internalize science and art and use them as the bases of medical practice. The curricular structure was made more flexible, allowing the student to participate in directing his learning and providing him adequate time for self-study and greater exposure to non-hospital settings of training. It shifted emphasis of the curricular content to topics, which were directly related to the national and local health and medical problem and issues. A uniform teaching method was utilized for all courses, which fostered the development of problem-solving skills in health and medicine. Through its continued excellence in the field of medical education, the College of Medicine was granted level II accreditation by the PAASCU for a three-year period. Through its linkages with training hospitals in the United States of America, qualified Filipino- Americans are offered the opportunity to undertake part of their clinical clerkship training in these hospitals.

He also wrote for Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, and Dizzy Gillespie. He was musical director for albums by Cannonball Adderley, Dinah Washington, Oscar Peterson, and Buddy Rich. ==Early career== Wilkins was born in St. Louis, Missouri. In his early career he played in a military band, before joining Earl Hines's last big band. He worked with Count Basie from 1951 to 1955, eventually leaving to work free-lance as a jazz arranger and songwriter. His success declined in the 1960s, but revived after work with Clark Terry, leading to a tour of Europe. ==Final years in Denmark== Eventually Wilkins settled in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he would live for the rest of his life. There he formed the Almost Big Band so he could write for a band of his own formation. The idea was partly inspired by his wife Jenny. Copenhagen had a thriving jazz scene with several promising jazz musicians as well as a well- established community of expatriate American jazz musicians which had formed in the 1950s and now included representatives like Kenny Drew and Ed Thigpen who joined the band along with Danish saxophonist Jesper Thilo.

By timing the arrival of a burst at several spacecraft, its precise location can be found. The precision for determining the direction of a GRB in the sky is improved by increasing the spacing of the detectors, and also by more accurate timing of the reception. Typical spacecraft baselines of about one AU (astronomical unit) and time resolutions of tens of milliseconds can determine a burst location within several arcminutes, allowing follow-up observations with other telescopes. ==Rationale== Gamma rays are too energetic to be focused with mirrors. The rays penetrate mirror materials instead of reflecting. Because gamma rays cannot be focused into an image in the traditional sense, a unique location for a gamma ray source cannot be determined as it is done with less energetic light. In addition, gamma ray bursts are brief flashes (often as little as 0.2 seconds) that occur randomly across the sky. Some forms of gamma ray telescope can generate an image, but they require longer integration times, and cover only a fraction of the sky. Once three spacecraft detect a GRB, their timings are sent to the ground for correlation. A sky position is derived, and distributed to the astronomical community for follow-up observations with optical, radio, or spaceborne telescopes. ==Iterations of the IPN== Note that, since any IPN must consist of several spacecraft, the boundaries between networks are defined differently by different commentators. Spacecraft naturally join or leave service as their missions unfold, and some modern spacecraft are far more capable than prior IPN members. ===A \\"planetary network\\"=== The Vela group of satellites was originally designed to detect covert nuclear tests, possibly at the Moon's altitude. Thus, the Velas were placed in high orbits, so that a time delay would occur between spacecraft triggers. In addition, each satellite had multiple gamma-ray detectors across their structures; the detectors facing a blast would register a higher gamma count than the detectors facing away. A gamma-ray burst was detected by the Vela group on June 3, 1969, and thus referred to as GRB 690603. The location was determined to be clearly outside of the satellites' orbit, and probably outside of the Solar system. After reviewing archived Vela data, a previous burst was determined to have occurred on July 2, 1967. Public reports of initial GRBs were not disclosed until the early 1970s. ===Further missions=== Additional spacecraft were given gamma-ray detectors. The Apollo 15 and 16 missions carried detectors to study the Moon; middle-to-late Venera spacecraft carried detectors to Venus. The relatively long baselines of these missions again showed that bursts originated at great distances. Other spacecraft (such as the OGO, OSO, and IMP series) had detectors for Earth, Solar, or all-sky gamma radiation, and also confirmed the GRB phenomenon. ===The first true IPN=== Scientists began to tailor instruments specifically for GRBs. The Helios-2 spacecraft carried a detector with precision time resolution to a Solar orbit that took it over one AU from Earth. Helios-2 was launched in 1976. In 1978, multiple spacecraft were launched, forming the necessary baselines for a position determination. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter and its Soviet counterparts, Venera 11 and 12, took gamma detectors to the orbit of Venus. In addition, the spacecraft Prognoz-7 and ISEE-3 remained in Earth orbit. These formed an Earth-Venus-Sun triangle, and the probes at Venus formed a smaller triangle. 84 bursts were detected, until the network degraded in 1980. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter continued until it entered the Venus atmosphere in 1992, but not enough other spacecraft were functioning to form the required baselines. On March 5 and 6, 1979, two bursts of hard X-rays were detected from the same source in the constellation Dorado by the Œ≥-ray burst detector Konus, on the Venera 11 and Venera 12 spacecraft. These X-ray bursts were detected by several other spacecraft. As part of the InterPlanetary Network (IPN), Venera 11, Venera 12 were hit by the March 5, 1979, hard X-ray burst at ~10:51 EST, followed 11 s later by Helios 2 in orbit around the Sun, then the Pioneer Venus Orbiter at Venus. Seconds later the Vela satellites, Prognoz 7, and the Einstein Observatory in orbit around Earth were inundated. The last satellite hit was the ISEE-3 before the burst exited the Solar System. ===The second IPN=== Pioneer Venus Orbiter was rejoined by Ulysses in 1990. The launch of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory in 1991 again formed triangular baselines with PVO and Ulysses. Ulysses continued until June 2009, and the PVO mission ended in August 1992. Compton once again brought directional discrimination with the BATSE instrument. Like the Velas, BATSE placed detectors at the spacecraft corners. Thus, Compton alone could determine a coarse burst location, to within 1.6 to 4 degrees. Baselines with other spacecraft were then used to sharpen Compton's position solutions. In addition, almost half the sky from Compton was blocked by the Earth, just as Venus blocked part of the sky for PVO. Detection or non-detection by Compton or PVO added another element to the location algorithms. Compton also had high-precision, low-field-of-view gamma instruments. Occasionally, GRBs would occur where Compton happened to be pointing. The use of multiple, sensitive instruments would provide much more accuracy than BATSE alone. ===The \\"third\\" IPN=== Compton and Ulysses were joined briefly by Mars Observer in late 1992, before that spacecraft failed. Some feel that Compton provided sufficient continuity, and that the distinction between 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent IPNs is semantic. ===\\"Additional\\" IPNs=== Compton and Ulysses were joined by Wind in 1994. Although Wind was in Earth orbit, like Compton, its altitude was very high, thus forming a short but usable baseline. The high altitude also meant that Earth blockage was negligible. In addition, Wind carried a top and bottom detector. Interpolation between the two units usually gave a general sky direction for bursts, which in many cases could augment the IPN algorithm. The addition of RXTE in 1995 also helped. Although RXTE was an X-ray mission in Earth orbit, it could detect those gamma-ray bursts which also shone in X-rays, and give a direction (rather than merely a time trigger) for them. Two important developments occurred in 1996. NEAR was launched; its trajectory to an asteroid again formed a triangular IPN measured in AUs. The IPN was also joined by BeppoSAX. BeppoSAX had wide-field gamma detectors, and narrow-field X-ray telescopes. Once a GRB was detected, operators could spin the spacecraft within hours to point the X-ray telescopes at the coarse location. The X-ray afterglow would then give a fine location. In 1997, the first fine location allowed detailed study of a GRB and its environ. Compton was deorbited in 2000; the NEAR mission was shut down in early 2001. In late 2001, the Mars Odyssey spacecraft again formed an interplanetary triangle. Other members of the network include or have included the Indian SROSS-C2 spacecraft, the US Air Force's Defense Meteorological Satellites, the Japanese Yohkoh spacecraft, and the Chinese SZ-2 mission. These have all been Earth orbiters, and the Chinese and Indian detectors were operational for only a few months. Of all the above, Ulysses is the only spacecraft whose orbit takes it large distances away from the ecliptic plane. These deviations from the ecliptic plane allow more precise 3-D measurements of the apparent positions of the GRBs. ==The 21st century: staring spacecraft== New techniques and designs in high-energy astronomy spacecraft are challenging the traditional operation of the IPN. Because distant probes require sensitive ground antennas for communication, they introduce a time lag into GRB studies. Large ground antennas must split time between spacecraft, rather than listen continuously for GRB notifications. Typically, GRB coordinates determined by deep space probes are distributed many hours to a day or two after the GRB. This is very frustrating for studies of events which are measured in seconds. A new generation of spacecraft are designed to produce GRB locations on board, then relay them to the ground within minutes or even seconds. These positions are based not on time correlation, but on X-ray telescopes, as on BeppoSAX but much faster. HETE-2, launched in 2000, stares at a large region of sky. Should a GRB trigger the gamma detectors, X-ray masks report sky coordinates to ground stations. Because HETE is in a low, consistent orbit, it can use many inexpensive ground stations. There is almost always a ground station in view of the spacecraft, which reduces latency to seconds. The Swift spacecraft, launched in 2004, is similar in operation but much more powerful. When a GRB triggers the gamma detectors, generating a crude position, the spacecraft spins relatively rapidly to use its focusing X-ray and optical telescopes. These refine the GRB location to within arcminutes, and often within arcseconds. The fine position is reported to the ground in approximately an hour. INTEGRAL is a successor to Compton. INTEGRAL can similarly determine a coarse position by comparing gamma counts from one side to another. It also possesses a gamma-ray telescope with an ability to determine positions to under a degree. INTEGRAL cannot pivot rapidly like the small HETE and Swift spacecraft. But should a burst happen to occur in its telescope field of view, its position and characteristics can be recorded with high precision. RHESSI was launched in 2002 to perform solar studies. However, its gamma instrument could detect bright gamma sources from other regions of the sky, and produce coarse positions through differential detectors. Occasionally, a GRB would appear next to the Sun, and the RHESSI instrument would determine its properties without IPN assistance. Note however, that all these spacecraft suffer from Earth blockage to varying degrees. Also, the more sophisticated the \\"staring\\" instrument, the lower the sky coverage. Randomly occurring GRBs are more likely to be missed, or detected at low resolution only. The use of non-directional deep space probes, such as MESSENGER and BepiColombo, will continue. ==Current IPN developments== In 2007 AGILE was launched and in 2008 the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and although these are Earth orbiters, their instruments provide directional discrimination. The Fermi Space Telescope uses both wide-area burst detectors and a narrow-angle telescope, and has a limited ability to spin itself to place a GRB within the telescope field. MESSENGER's Gamma Ray Neutron Spectrometer was able to add data to the IPN, before the end of MESSENGER's mission in 2015. Due to falling power from its RTG, Ulysses was decommissioned on June 30, 2009. == See also == * Gamma- ray Burst Coordinates Network ==References== ==External links== *IPN Progress Report A Quarterly Refereed Journal *IPN Status report IPN status as of September 24, 2007.

Riders on stationary bikes compete against each other in front of spectators. While roller racing has a history going back to the beginning of cycling, Goldsprints are fairly new and closely related to bicycle messenger culture. It began in Zurich, Switzerland as part of the 1999 Cycle Messenger World Championships. At which point the name and the event were founded by Adrien Weber, a passionate cyclist and owner of the TurbinenBr√§u brewery in Zurich, Turbinenbr√§u. The event was named after their beer brand \\"Gold- Sprint\\". As opposed to traditional roller racing, where riders have to balance, Goldsprints use forkstands so that the riders don't have to balance, only pedal as fast as they can. This provides an easy way for anyone to try Goldsprints. However some Goldsprints groups are now adding traditional rollers, without forkstands, to their equipment to challenge the advanced riders. As with roller racing in general, the rollers are in turn attached to a device that measures distance and can display the progress of the riders. Goldsprints can also feature modern 2D and 3D visualizations. == Technology == There are two varieties of Goldsprints system: Electronic * Used for large crowds. Digital projectors and screens can project the graphical dial as big as needed. * Electronically driven, with a tachometer sensor (typically a reed switch, hall effect sensor or a photo-interrupter), and visualizations digitally projected on a screen; thus eliminating the inaccuracy of human response time and stopwatches. * Compact and portable. Team Beer (Portland, Oregon, USA) transports their entire system (including two bikes) via a Metrofiets cargo bike. * Cost effective. Whether you are building a system from scratch or buying a turn key it is considerably cheaper/less time- consuming to build or buy than mechanical systems. * Customizable interfaces. Software can be changed and re-skinned. Giving homage to Barelli rollers, most interfaces include a clock face with primary colors for the clock arms. Mechanical * Can determine placing, but an electronic system (and electricity) is still required to show actual times. Able to operate without any external power (i.e. electricity), however if times are recorded by stopwatch. * Driven mechanically by custom belts and pulleys, and drives a physical clock face or other display which shows rider progress. * Tend to be large and heavy, but stable and simple and were the only systems prior to the spread of affordable microcomputers. ==Vinylsprint== Vinylsprint race The Vinylsprint is a variation of a Goldsprint race. It was invented by the makers of the International Cycling Film Festival and introduced at the 8th ICFF in 2013. The Vinylsprint is a mixture of mechanical and electronic Goldsprint systems. Two stationary bicycles are coupled with belt-drive turntables: Pedaling the stationary bicycle operates a record player. Its tone arm is connected with a computer, and the stylus works as a speed sensor for the stationary bike. The racetrack is simulated by a video projection, both cyclists have to ride a similar virtual parkour on the cinema screen. == Event format == While each event promoter may take their liberties. The most common format is a qualifying round and then a series of knockout rounds until the category winners are established. == Systems == Many systems have been made over the years. Some have been commercial grade, others one-offs.

Edward Digby, a Member of Parliament for Warwickshire 1726 from 1746. His elder brother was Edward Digby, 6th Baron Digby, a Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales from 1751 to 1753. His paternal grandparents were William Digby, 5th Baron Digby and Lady Jane Noel (second daughter of Edward Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough and Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton). His mother was the daughter of Sir Stephen Fox. Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, was his uncle and Charles James Fox his cousin. ==Career== Sherborne Castle, Dorset. Digby was elected to the House of Commons for Ludgershall in 1755, a seat he held until 1761, and then represented Wells between 1761 and 1765. From 1763 to 1765, he was a Lord of the Admiralty. In 1757 he succeeded his elder brother Edward as the 7th Baron Digby but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to sit in the British House of Lords and did not force him to resign his seat in the House of Commons. It did however give him ownership of the family seat of Sherborne Castle. In 1765 Digby was created 1st Baron Digby, of Sherborne in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of Great Britain with remainder to the male issue of his father. He had then to give up his seat in the Commons and join his peers in the Lords. From 1771 to 1793 Lord Digby served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset. In 1790 he was further honoured when he was 1st Viscount Coleshill and 1st Earl Digby in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to his heirs male. ==Personal life== On 5 September 1763, Lord Digby married Elizabeth Feilding, a daughter of Hon. Charles Feilding (a son of Basil Feilding, 4th Earl of Denbigh and Hester Firebrace, eldest daughter and heiress of Sir Basil Firebrace, 1st Baronet) and Anne (n√©e Palmer) Bridges (the widow of Sir Brook Bridges, 2nd Baronet and daughter, and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Palmer, 4th Baronet, of Wingham). Together, they had one son: * Hon. Edward Digby (1764‚Äì1764), who died in infancy. After his first wife's death in 1765 he married, secondly, Mary Knowler, daughter of John Knowler Recorder of Canterbury, on 10 November 1770. They had five children: * Lady Charlotte Digby (1772‚Äì1807), married William Wingfield, MP for Bodmin, in 1796. * Edward Digby, 2nd Earl Digby (1773‚Äì1856), who served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1808 to 1856. * Hon.

Lord Digby died in September 1793, aged 62, and was succeeded in his title by his eldest son Edward. The Countess Digby died in 1794.

They changed their name in late 2002 and released three studio albums, The Good Fight for Harmony (December 2005), Hollow Be My Name (March 2009) and BƒÅnh≈´s (October 2013). They disbanded in 2016. ==History== Eleventh He Reaches London started in December 1999 as a quartet, Our Lasting Loss, by Mark Donaldson on drums, Ian Lenton on lead vocals and guitar, Alex Lucas on bass guitar and Jayden Worts on lead guitar; all were aged 17. In 2001 their track, \\"You Left Me at the Crossroads Like Val Kilmer in Willow\\", appeared on a various artists' compilation album, Left of Centre 2. It was recorded with Allen Smith producing, at Bergerk! Studios, and mixed and mastered by Rob Swire of Pendulum. Shortly after Lucas left the band and was replaced by Brad Rowland on bass guitar. They changed their name in late 2002, which comes from an epic poem, Don Juan, by Lord Byron: in its eleventh chapter, the protagonist reaches London. In late 2003 the band released its first extended play, Diving for Treacher. Smith produced, mixed and mastered the three-track EP, their line-up changed again with Craig McElhinney replacing Rowland and the addition of Jeremy Martin, as their third guitarist, adding a new dimension to its sound. During 2004 Eleventh He Reaches London played supported other artists, Against Me!, Shai Hulud and The Nation Blue. In October of that year they completed four shows in Melbourne. Martin described the group's style in December 2005: > Collectively, we listen to a very diverse range of music, and I think our > music reflects this. We all like many of the same artists, but each of us > have quite different tastes. All of us enjoy listening to and creating music > that is dramatic, and that creates a strong sense of mood... We don't fit > neatly into any one scene within Perth, and we are more than happy about > this. While some may see it as a disadvantage, for us it means we have the > pleasure of performing alongside artists playing a diverse range of styles. > Playing with the same bands and to the same crowd week in, week out tends to > get tedious, and removes any element of surprise a gig may have. It removes > the challenge of attempting to win over punters that haven't seen or heard > you before. == The Good Fight for Harmony == In early 2005, the band returned to Bergerk! Studios with Allen Smith to record their first studio album. The group performed at the West Australian Music Industry Awards Festival and RTRFM's In the Pines, as well as being the only main stage support act on the Perth leg of Taste of Chaos, where they performed to a sold-out Robinson Pavilion with the Used, Killswitch Engage, Funeral for a Friend, Story of the Year and Rise Against. After six months in the recording studio, with the album mastered by Shaun O'Callaghan at Studio Couch, The Good Fight for Harmony was released on 14 December 2005. It reached the top of the local charts, almost selling out of its first pressing within a month and a half. \\"Say You See Why So\\" received airplay on Triple J and local radio. In 2006 Eleventh He Reaches London started writing for a second album. The band performed as part of the WAMi Festival and won its first WAMi Award (for 'Favourite Newcomer'). The band completed a short Western Australia tour with Gyroscope, supported Les Savy Fav, returned to Melbourne to promote The Good Fight For Harmony, and also supported Coheed and Cambria on their first Australian tour. In 2007, they band played support for Converge, ISIS and Funeral for a Friend on the Perth leg of their respective Australian tours and won a second WAMi Award ('Best Hardcore/Punk Act'). The band received a grant from the Department of Culture and Arts (Western Australia) to assist in the production of the second album. In 2008 Eleventh He Reaches London released the lead track (on-line), \\"For the Commonwealth and the Queen\\", ahead of their second album, Hollow be my Name. In June that year, bass guitarist McElhinney left the band to pursue a solo project and explore other musical interests. The band signed with Good Cop Bad Cop Records in July 2008, which re-released The Good Fight for Harmony on 16 August 2008. As a result of delay in the band's second album due to line-up changes (with a February 2009 release date) their new record label released a 7\\" single, \\"Girt by Piss\\", on 25 October 2008. Also in October, the band introduced its replacement for McElhinney, Luke Pollard, and undertook a national tour in support of the new single. The B-side of the single, \\"Hill of Grace\\", was nominated for the 2008 WAM Song of the Year competition. The band's second album, Hollow Be My Name, was released on 28 March 2009 on Good Cop Bad Cop Records. Thematically, the album is dark and introspective; Martin explained: In April 2012 the band joined Hobbledehoy Record Co. for reissues of their previous material. Their third album, BƒÅnh≈´s, was released through that label on 4 October 2013.

Born in Turin in 1943, Faenza received a degree in Political Science and a diploma at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. ==Career== Faenza made his directing debut in 1968 with the international success, Escalation, a film that describes the different sides of power through the relationship between a middle-class father and his hippie son. Immediately after that he directed H2S, an angry apology of the 1968 movement, seized two days after its release and not distributed since. Upon this sequestration he travelled to the United States to teach at the Federal City College of Washington DC. In 1978 he directed Forza Italia!, a ferocious satire on the power of the Italian Christian Democrat party covering thirty years of Italian political history. The film was withdrawn from the theatres on the day Aldo Moro, President of the Christian Democrats, was kidnapped, and remains banned for over 15 years. Aldo Moro being the one who will end his life recommending (in his handwritten memoirs found in the den of the Red Brigades in via Monte Nevoso in Milan) to see the film ‚Äúif one wants to realize the recklessness of his fellow party members‚Äù.Roberto Faenza racconta \\"Forza Italia!\\" - Percorsi di Cinema 2009, ANAC autori, Feb 20, 2018, min.43-33Memoriale Moro, Sezione \\"LA DEMOCRAZIA CRISTIANA\\", Comm.

Considered as a politically incorrect director, he was forced to work outside of Italy to be able to find financing: in 1983 he filmed Copkiller in New York City with Harvey Keitel, Nicole Garcia and the leader of the Sex Pistols, Johnny Rotten. His activities are not limited to cinema: author of essays and books (best known among them: Senza chiedere permesso, Il malaffare, Gli americani in Italia), upon his return in Italy he starts teaching Mass Communication at Pisa University. After Copkiller he became inspired by literature as a source of stories. In 1990 he directed The Bachelor, based on a short story by Arthur Schnitzler with a wide cast of profiled actors: Keith Carradine, Miranda Richardson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Max von Sydow. In 1993 he directed Jonah Who Lived in the Whale starring actress Juliet Aubrey for which he was awarded the David di Donatello for Best Director. The film was entered into the 18th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Prix of Ecumenical Jury. Two years later another novel (this time by Antonio Tabucchi) was the source: Sostiene Pereira, Marcello Mastroianni‚Äôs last Italian film, the latter awarded with a David di Donatello as Best Leading Actor. In 1997 he directed Marianna Ucria based on the novel La lunga vita di Marianna Ucria by Dacia Maraini. It was entered into the 20th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1999 he directed The Lost Lover, inspired by the bestseller by Abraham B. Yehoshua about the ongoing clash between Jews and Palestinians. In 2003 he received international success with The Soul Keeper, based on the burning passion between Carl Gustav Jung and his young Russian patient Sabina Spielrein. His most recent films are: Come into the Light, about the life of Pino Puglisi, the parish priest killed in Palermo by the Mafia in 1993, played by Luca Zingaretti (Nomination European Academy Award (EFA) as Best Director 2005; David Giovani Best Film Award; Flaiano Best Leading Actor Award and Audience Award for the Best Film; Best Leading Actor Award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival 2005; San Fedele Best Film Award); The Days of Abandonment, inspired on the novel by Elena Ferrante, with Margherita Buy, Luca Zingaretti and the musician Goran Bregovic.

The executive producers were Lou Gonda and Jody Patton.. Set in an unnamed Latin American country, it is the story of one man's discovery of what actually happened in the political history of his nation as well as his students. It was filmed in Mexico and most of the crew were Mexican. ==Plot synopsis== Dr. Fuentes (Federico Luppi) is a medical professor/doctor near his retirement and his wife has recently died. He taught a group of seven - he views this as one of his greatest accomplishments - that trains young people to provide health care to impoverished citizens in the outlying hill country, where small agricultural communities struggle to survive. Fuentes has recently heard rumors that his former students are lost and possibly dead, so he musters up the courage and travels into the outlands to investigate. It is not until he begins his journey that he discovers a world much different than the one he had imagined existing for his students as he finds himself encountering guerrillas and soldiers. As Fuentes digs into the jungle in search of his students, he discovers that men with guns have reached them first, his students being menaced by many men with guns (Hombres Armados). This indicates military forces who use torture and execution to intimidate people. He discovers that the guerillas from opposition political groups are only marginally less aggressive. On his journey he accumulates a few travelling companions: Padre Portillo (Dami√°n Alc√°zar), a fallen priest who has lost his faith; Domingo (Dami√°n Delgado), a deserter from the Army without a country; Conejo (Dan Rivera Gonzalez), an orphan who survives by stealing; and Graciela (Tania Cruz), a woman who has turned mute after she was raped by the military. Fuentes finds that his journey is revealing but also perilous the deeper he ventures. He ends up travelling into the hill country, looking for his last student, who is rumored to be living in an Edenic village high in the mountains, safe from the violence which has engulfed the countryside. As the doctor and his companions get closer to this half-mythical place, the journey becomes a quest for both safety and an assurance for Fuentes that his life has had some meaning. ==Cast== * Federico Luppi as Dr. Fuentes * Dami√°n Delgado as Domingo, the soldier * Dan Rivera Gonzalez as Conejo, the boy * Tania Cruz as Graciela, the mute girl * Dami√°n Alc√°zar as Padre Portillo, the priest * Mandy Patinkin as Andrew * Kathryn Grody as Harriet * Roverto Sosa as Bravo * Carmen Madrid as Angela, Dr. Fuentes's daughter * Esteban Soberanes as Ra√∫l, Angela's fianc√© * Alejandro Springall as Carlos, Dr. Fuentes's son ==Background== Principal photography was done in thirty-seven shooting days in January and February 1997 and filmed in over forty locations. John Sayles' films tend to be politically aware and social concerns are a theme running through most of his work. This film's idea came from his friends, one of whom was the novelist Francisco Goldman. He had an uncle who was a doctor in Guatemala and was involved in an international health program. A few years later he came to find out that most of his students, whom he had sent off to serve as rural doctors, had been murdered by the government that supported the program. Sayles does not name the country in the film, and the music he uses is quite eclectic and not tied to any specific Latin American country. This is because Sayles did not want people to think that it can \\"only happen in El Salvador, that can only happen in Guatemala or Mexico\\". He felt the film has universal overtones and the events portrayed in the story could have happened anywhere on the planet.Men with Guns, Sony Classic Pictures Official Web Site, production section. ===Filming locations=== The movie was filmed entirely in Mexico, in 40 locations, including: Mexico City; Ciudad Nezahualc√≥yotl; Pueblo Naranjal, Xonotzintla, Soledad Atzompa, Zongolica, and Jalapilla, all in Veracruz; Palenque and San Jos√© Babilonia, both in Chiapas. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Roger Ebert, film critic writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, liked the film, and wrote, \\"Men With Guns is immensely moving and sad, and yet because it dares so much, it is an exhilarating film. It frees itself from specific stories about this villain or that strategy, to stand back and look at the big picture: at societies in collapse because power has been concentrated in the hands of small men made big with guns.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, March 27, 1998. Accessed: August 4, 2013. Critic Jack Mathews liked Sayles' straightforward unadorned style, and he wrote, \\"Men With Guns is a slow-paced trip, with a lot of translated conversation, and Sayles keeps it pure. The actors are said to be speaking in four dialects, and there's nothing about the film, other than the ill- conceived couple (Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody) used as comic relief, to give away its American origin. Sayles has never been a visual stylist, and his latest film is as straightforward and plot-bound as any of the earlier ones.\\"Mathews, Jack. Los Angeles Times, \\"Sayles Again Goes His Own Way With Effective Guns,\\" March 13, 1998. Andrew Johnston (critic) wrote in Time Out New York, \\"The title of John Sayles's latest film suggests a Tarentinoesque lark, but don't be fooled: There are no wise-cracking hit men to be found here. Men with Guns is a somber rumination on the nature of violence and the sometimes disastrous effects of good intentions. While not as epic as his last film, the masterful Lone Star, it's still another bold triumph for one of America's most independent-minded filmmakers.\\" The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty-seven reviews.Men with Guns at Rotten Tomatoes.

It opened to poor reviews and low box office receipts. Previews billed it as \\"the black experience in Vietnam\\". The box-office gross was over $6,000,000.00.The Walking Dead ‚Äì Box Office Mojo, checked on January 5th, 2011 ==Plot== In 1972 North Vietnam, short-timer Marines are dispatched by helicopter to conduct their last mission: to evacuate the survivors from a POW camp abandoned by the Viet Cong. The landing zone - which they expect to be cold - is actually hot (under fire) and after a short fight, only four members of the rescue mission survive. SSgt. Barkley and Hoover have a brief fight after Hoover wants to radio for an evacuation and Barkley insists they finish the mission. During their fight a mortar lands nearby, knocking them both into a swamp. Barkley saves Branche from drowning. They are joined shortly by Brooks and Evans. The soldiers defer to the ranking Marine, Sgt. Barkley, who insists that they press on to a nearby cathedral. They reach the building and kill several NVA soldiers. At morning, they are planning their next move when they are ambushed by more NVA soldiers including tree snipers. After a firefight they manage to kill the soldiers with the help of Cpl. Pippins, who appears from the brush and also begins attacking them. After subduing Pippins they look for the rest of his platoon and discover them murdered and their radio missing. They decide to tie Pippins up and bring him along as they march toward the POW camp. The group then recollect about each of their individual reasons for joining the Marines. Sgt Barkley was a preacher at a church until he came home to his bedroom seeing his wife in bed having sex with another man, Barkley shoots and kills the man and catches the train out of town. Hoover works for a meat packing place until he got fired for stealing meat. Cole tries to rent an apartment, but he is turned down by the real estate agent, because of his race. Brooks tells his girlfriend that he's joining the Marine Corps to be like his grandfather, Pippins was working for Ray until he is killed by gangsters and chased into the military enlistment line without getting caught. While Cole and Barkley go ahead to survey the area, Hoover and Brooks smoke cannabis and talk about Brooks' girlfriend, who just dumped him via the mail. During their break, Pippins escapes and takes Brooks' pistol. The four men regroup and head out without Pippins. When they reach the camp, they discover a deranged Pippins holding a Vietnamese woman hostage. After killing the woman in front of them, Pippis turns on them with a gun and is killed by Sgt. Barkley. After seeing the camp is empty, the men realize they are expendable decoys. They radio in and are informed that the Marines cleared the POW camp four hours earlier, and that they have 20 minutes to reach their pickup point before the entire area is bombed. As the men go to leave bombs begin dropping on them. They escape the bombardment and head through the jungle to the landing zone, but are ambushed by more NVA soldiers. Brooks is killed, and Cole and Barkley wounded. Hoover goes back and rescues Barkley and the three men are evacuated by helicopter. During an epilogue, we are told that Cole became a career Marine who retired after 20 years of service, Sgt. Barkley took a job counseling troubled teens in Georgia, and Hoover went back home, married his girlfriend and opened up his own business. ==Cast== *Allen Payne as Cole Evans *Eddie Griffin as Pvt.

He variously worked with Luther Henderson, Thelonious Monk, Fletcher Henderson, Tadd Dameron, and Dizzy Gillespie amongst others. ==Biography== Edmund Gregory first played alto saxophone professionally for Luther Henderson at age 13 and went on to study at the Boston Conservatory and to play with trumpeter Roy Eldridge. He played lead alto with Fletcher Henderson in the mid 1940s. He was one of the first jazz musicians to convert to Islam and changed his name in 1947. During the late 1940s, Shihab played with Thelonious Monk and on July 23, 1951 he recorded with Monk for the Lp Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2. During this period, he also appeared on recordings by Art Blakey, Kenny Dorham and Benny Golson. The invitation to play with Dizzy Gillespie's big band in the early 1950s was of particular significance as it marked Shihab's switch to baritone. On August 12, 1958, Shihab was one of the musicians photographed by Art Kane in his famous photograph known as \\"A Great Day in Harlem\\". In 1959, he toured Europe with Quincy Jones after getting disillusioned with racial politics in United States and ultimately settled in Scandinavia. He worked for Copenhagen Polytechnic and wrote scores for television, cinema and theatre. In 1961, he joined the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band and remained a member of the band for the 12 years it existed. He married a Danish woman and raised a family in Europe, although he remained a conscious African-American still sensitive to racial issues. In the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, Shihab accompanied Lill Lindfors and Svante Thuresson on stage for the Swedish entry \\"Nygammal Vals\\". In 1973, Shihab returned to the United States for a three- year hiatus, working as a session man for rock and pop artists and also doing some copy writing for local musicians.

The terms \\"data loss\\" and \\"data leak\\" are related and are often used interchangeably.Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici, Lior Rokach, A Survey of Data Leakage Detection and Prevention Solutions, Springer-Verlag New York Incorporated, 2012 Data loss incidents turn into data leak incidents in cases where media containing sensitive information is lost and subsequently acquired by an unauthorized party. However, a data leak is possible without losing the data on the originating side. Other terms associated with data leakage prevention are information leak detection and prevention (ILDP), information leak prevention (ILP), content monitoring and filtering (CMF), information protection and control (IPC) and extrusion prevention system (EPS), as opposed to intrusion prevention system. ==Categories== The technological means employed for dealing with data leakage incidents can be divided into categories: standard security measures, advanced/intelligent security measures, access control and encryption and designated DLP systems, although only the latter category are currently thought of as DLP today.Phua, C., Protecting organisations from personal data breaches, Computer Fraud and Security, 1:13-18, 2009 ===Standard measures=== Standard security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus software, are commonly available products that guard computers against outsider and insider attacks. The use of a firewall, for example, prevents the access of outsiders to the internal network and an intrusion detection system detects intrusion attempts by outsiders. Inside attacks can be averted through antivirus scans that detect Trojan horses that send confidential information, and by the use of thin clients that operate in a client-server architecture with no personal or sensitive data stored on a client device. ===Advanced measures=== Advanced security measures employ machine learning and temporal reasoning algorithms to detect abnormal access to data (e.g., databases or information retrieval systems) or abnormal email exchange, honeypots for detecting authorized personnel with malicious intentions and activity-based verification (e.g., recognition of keystroke dynamics) and user activity monitoring for detecting abnormal data access. ===Designated systems=== Designated systems detect and prevent unauthorized attempts to copy or send sensitive data, intentionally or unintentionally, mainly by personnel who are authorized to access the sensitive information. In order to classify certain information as sensitive, these use mechanisms, such as exact data matching, structured data fingerprinting, statistical methods, rule and regular expression matching, published lexicons, conceptual definitions, keywords and contextual information such as the source of the data.Ouellet, E., Magic Quadrant for Content-Aware Data Loss Prevention, Technical Report, RA4 06242010, Gartner RAS Core Research, 2012 ==Types Network === Network (data in motion) technology is typically installed at network egress points near the perimeter. It analyzes network traffic to detect sensitive data that is being sent in violation of information security policies. Multiple security control points may report activity to be analyzed by a central management server. ===Endpoint === Endpoint (data in use) systems run on internal end-user workstations or servers. Like network-based systems, endpoint-based technology can address internal as well as external communications. it can therefore be used to control information flow between groups or types of users (e.g. 'Chinese walls'). They can also control email and Instant Messaging communications before they reach the corporate archive, such that a blocked communication (i.e., one that was never sent, and therefore not subject to retention rules) will not be identified in a subsequent legal discovery situation. Endpoint systems have the advantage that they can monitor and control access to physical devices (such as mobile devices with data storage capabilities) and in some cases can access information before it is encrypted. Endpoint systems also have access to the information needed to provide contextual classification; for example the source or author generating content. Some endpoint-based systems provide application controls to block attempted transmissions of confidential information and provide immediate user feedback. They must be installed on every workstation in the network, cannot be used on mobile devices (e.g., cell phones and PDAs) or where they cannot be practically installed (for example on a workstation in an Internet caf√©). ===Data identification=== DLP includes techniques for identifying confidential or sensitive information. Sometimes confused with discovery, data identification is a process by which organizations use a DLP technology to determine what to look for. Data is classified as either structured or unstructured. Structured data resides in fixed fields within a file such as a spreadsheet, while unstructured data refers to free-form text or media in text documents, PDF files and video. An estimated 80% of all data is unstructured and 20% structured.Brian E. Burke, ‚ÄúInformation Protection and Control survey: Data Loss Prevention and Encryption trends,‚Äù IDC, May 2008 ===Data leak detection=== Sometimes a data distributor gives sensitive data to one or more third parties. Sometime later, some of the data is found in an unauthorized place (e.g., on the web or on a user's laptop). The distributor must then investigate the source of the leak. ===Data at rest=== \\"Data at rest\\" specifically refers to information that is not moving, i.e. that exists in a database or a file share. This information is of great concern to businesses and government institutions simply because the longer data is left unused in storage, the more likely it might be retrieved by unauthorized individuals. Protecting such data involves methods such as access control, data encryption and data retention policies. === Data in use === \\"Data in use\\" refers to data that the user is currently interacting with. DLP systems that protect data in-use may monitor and flag unauthorized activities. These activities include screen-capture, copy/paste, print and fax operations involving sensitive data. It can be intentional or unintentional attempts to transmit sensitive data over communication channels. === Data in motion === \\"Data in motion\\" is data that is traversing through a network to an endpoint. Networks can be internal or external. DLP systems that protect data in-motion monitor sensitive data traveling across a network through various communication channels. == See also == * List of backup software * Metadata removal tool * Endpoint detection and response == References == Category:Data security Category:Information technology Category:Data management software ","title":"Data loss prevention software"},{"id":"9105359","text":"Edward Digby, 2nd Earl Digby (6 January 1773 ‚Äì 12 May 1856), known as Viscount Coleshill from 1790 to 1793, was a British peer.

An optically-pumped disk laser (active mirror). A disk laser or active mirror (Fig.1) is a type of diode pumped solid-state laser characterized by a heat sink and laser output that are realized on opposite sides of a thin layer of active gain medium. Despite their name, disk lasers do not have to be circular; other shapes have also been tried. The thickness of the disk is considerably smaller than the laser beam diameter. The disk laser concepts allows very high average and peak powers due to its large area leading to moderate power densities on the active material. ==Active mirrors and disk lasers== Fig.2. A disk laser (active mirror) configuration presented in 1992 at the SPIE conference. Initially, disk lasers were called active mirrors, because the gain medium of a disk laser is essentially an optical mirror with reflection coefficient greater than unity. An active mirror is a thin disk- shaped double-pass optical amplifier. The first active mirrors were developed in the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (United States). Then, the concept was developed in various research groups, in particular, the University of Stuttgart (Germany) for Yb:doped glasses. In the disk laser, the heat sink does not have to be transparent, so, it can be extremely efficient even with large transverse size ~L~ of the device (Fig.1). The increase in size allows the power scaling to many kilowatts without significant modification of the design. ==Limit of power scaling for disk lasers== ASE in a disk laser The power of such lasers is limited not only by the power of pump available, but also by overheating, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and the background round-trip loss.; To avoid overheating, the size ~L~ should be increased with power scaling. Then, to avoid strong losses due to the exponential growth of the ASE, the transverse-trip gain ~u=GL~ cannot be large. This requires reduction of the gain G~; this gain is determined by the reflectivity of the output coupler and thickness ~h. The round-trip gain ~g=2Gh~ should remain larger than the round-trip loss \\\\beta~ (the difference g\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\beta~ determines the optical energy, which is output from the laser cavity at each round-trip). The reduction of gain G~, in a given round-trip loss ~\\\\beta~, requires increasing the thickness h. Then, at some critical size, the disk becomes too thick and cannot be pumped above the threshold without overheating. Some features of the power scaling can revealed from a simple model. Let Q~ be the saturation intensity, of the medium, \\\\eta_0=\\\\omega_{\\\\rm s}/\\\\omega_{\\\\rm p}~~ be the ratio of frequencies, R~ be the thermal loading parameter. The key parameter P_{\\\\rm k}=\\\\eta_0\\\\frac{R^2}{Q\\\\beta^3}~ determines the maximal power of the disk laser. The corresponding optimal thickness can be estimated with h \\\\sim \\\\frac{R}{Q \\\\beta}. The corresponding optimal size L \\\\sim \\\\frac{R}{Q \\\\beta^2}. Roughly, the round-trip loss should scale inversely proportionally to the cubic root of the power required. An additional issue is the efficient delivery of pump energy. In low round-trip gain, the single-pass absorption of the pump is also low. Therefore, recycling of pump energy is required for efficient operation. (See the additional mirror M at the left- hand side of figure 2.) For power scaling, the medium should be optically thin, with many passes of pump energy required; the lateral delivery of pump energy also might be a possible solution. ===Scaling of disk lasers via self- imaging=== Thin disk diode-pumped solid-state lasers may be scaled by means of transverse mode-locking in Talbot cavities. The remarkable feature of Talbot scaling is that Fresnel number F of the N- element laser array phase-locked by self-imaging is given by: F=N^2. ==Anti-ASE cap== Fig. 4. Uncovered disk laser and that with undoped cap. In order to reduce the impact of ASE, an anti-ASE cap consisting of undoped material on the surface of a disk laser has been suggested. Such a cap allows spontaneously emitted photons to escape from the active layer and prevents them from resonating in the cavity. Rays cannot bounce (Figure 3) as in an uncovered disk. This could allow an order of magnitude increase in the maximum power achievable by a disk laser. In both cases, the back reflection of the ASE from the edges of the disk should be suppressed. This can be done with absorbing layers, shown with green in Figure 4. At operation close to the maximal power, a significant part of the energy goes into ASE; therefore, the absorbing layers also should be supplied with heat sinks, which are not shown in the figure. Fig. 5. Upper bound of loss \\\\beta at which the output power P_{\\\\rm s} of a single disk laser is still achievable. Dashed line corresponds to uncovered disk; thick solid curve represents the case with undoped cap. ==Key parameter for laser materials== The estimate of maximal power achievable at given loss \\\\beta, is very sensitive to \\\\beta. The estimate of the upper bound of \\\\beta, at which the desired output power P_{\\\\rm s} is achievable is robust. This estimate is plotted versus normalized power s=P_{\\\\rm s}/P_{\\\\rm d} in figure 5. Here, P_{\\\\rm s} is the output power of the laser, and P_{\\\\rm d}=R^2/Q is dimensional scale of power; it is related with the key parameter P_{\\\\rm k}=P_{\\\\rm d}/\\\\beta^3. The thick dashed line represents the estimate for the uncovered disk. The thick solid line shows the same for the disk with undoped cap. The thin solid line represents the qualitative estimate \\\\beta=s^{1/3} without coefficients. Circles corresponds to the experimental data for the power achieved and corresponding estimates for the background loss \\\\beta. All future experiments and numerical simulations and estimates are expected to give values of (\\\\beta, s), that are below the red dashed line in Fig.5 for the uncovered disks, and below the blue curve for the disks with anti-ASE cap. This can be interpreted as a scaling law for disk lasers . In the vicinity of the curves mentioned, the efficiency of the disk laser is low; most of the pumping power goes to ASE, and is absorbed at the edges of the device. In these cases, the distribution of the pump energy available among several disks may significantly improve the performance of the lasers. Indeed, some lasers reported using several elements combined in the same cavity. ==Pulsed operation== Similar scaling laws take place for pulsed operation. In quasi continuous wave regime, the maximal mean power can be estimated by scaling the saturation intensity with the fill factor of the pump, and the product of the duration of pump to the repetition rate. At short duration pulses, more detailed analysis is required . At moderate values of the repetition rate (say, higher than 1 Hz), the maximal energy of the output pulses is roughly inversely proportional to the cube of the background loss \\\\beta; the undoped cap may provide an additional order of magnitude of mean output power, under the condition that this cap does not contribute to the background loss. At low repetition rate (and in the regime of single pulses) and sufficient pump power, there is no general limit of energy, but the required size of the device grows quickly with increase of the required pulse energy , setting the practical limit of energy; it is estimated that from a few joules to a few thousand joules can be extracted in an optical pulse from a single active element, dependently on the level of the background internal loss of the signal in the disk. . ==See also== *VCSEL *VECSEL *Thermal shock *Round-trip gain *Power scaling *Gain medium *List of laser articles == References == Category:Solid-state lasers ","title":"Disk laser"},{"id":"9105392","text":"Palazzo Ajutamicristo Palazzo Ajutamicristo is a palace in Palermo, Sicily. It was constructed between 1495 and 1501 by Guglielmo Ajutamicristo, Baron of Misilmeri and Calatafimi. Originally a merchant, Ajutamicristo made his fortune trading in Sicilian cheese and cereals. The palazzo was built to celebrate and display the family's newly acquired wealth. The architect selected was the already eminent Matteo Carnilivari and a site chosen in the street now called Via Garibaldi, close to the now demolished Termini Gate. The original plan was for a far larger and extravagant house; however, these plans had to be modified and financial restraint exercised. Thus, the completed house was smaller than originally intended. In spite of its reduced size the house became a centre of Sicilian high society, and was considered a residence superior to Palermo's royal palace. As a consequence, the Ajutamicristos entertained many leading political figures of the day: the Queen of Naples was entertained in great style at the house in 1500, and the Emperor Charles V in 1535. The Ajutamicristo's ownership of the house was to be short-lived, and in 1588 the owner Margherita Ajutamicristo sold the building to Francesco Moncada, Ist Prince of Patern√≤. The property remained in the ownership of the Patern√≤ family for two hundred years until the 18th century when it was sold to Baron Calefati di Canalotti in whose family it has remained until the present day. The Calefati family had many of the salons remodelled. Of particular note is the frescoed ballroom with its ceiling painted by Giuseppe Crestadoro depicting The Glory of the Virtuous Prince. == External links == *Palazzo Ajutamicristo *Palazzo Aiutamicristo information Category:Houses completed in 1501 Category:Palaces in Palermo Category:Museums in Palermo Category:Gothic architecture in Palermo Category:Historic house museums in Italy Category:1501 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Palazzo Ajutamicristo"},{"id":"9105409","text":"Clinton Gregory (born March 1, 1964 in Martinsville, Virginia) is an American country and bluegrass singer, songwriter, and fiddler.

Commodore was originally formed in Canada and initially produced mechanical typewriters and calculators. In 1965, Jack Tramiel, Commodore's founder and CEO, decided to purchase the Canadian store chain Wilson's Stationers to provide a sales channel for their products. To fund the purchase they borrowed $3 million from Atlantic Acceptance Corporation at an 11% interest rate. On 14 June 1965, Atlantic bounced a $5 million check and was insolvent within days. This led to all their capital loans being called in, including Commodore's $3 million. Looking for a way out of the problem, Irving Gould arranged the sale of Wilson's Stationers to a US company. To pay off the bridge loan, Gould purchased 17% of Commodore's stock in 1966 for $400,000.Chronological History of Commodore Computer Over the next decade, the company repeatedly had difficulties and repeatedly turned to Gould for funding. Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, Japanese companies began introducing typewriters and calculators at price points Commodore could not match. Tramiel responded by moving into the newly emerging field of electronic calculators. Irving had a Japanese girlfriend and kept up on changes in Japanese industry. In the mid-1970s, Irving told Jack Tramiel that the Japanese were starting to produce calculators using CMOS electronics that were going to \\"kick your butt.\\" Tramiel visited Japan to examine their systems, and found they would not sell their technology to the US. The Japanese companies were able to undercut Commodore both in technology and by being vertically integrated. Texas Instruments, one of Commodore's suppliers, decided to follow this pattern and introduced complete calculators at prices below what they sold the parts to Commodore. Gould provided funding to keep Commodore going during the period where they were being forced out of the calculator business. Tramiel responded by buying MOS Technology to supply microprocessors and moving into the computer market. Gould and Mehdi Ali (then Commodore's Managing Director) have also been accused of causing the death of Commodore in 1993‚Äì94 by making a series of mistakes like trying to maximize profit by producing low cost equipment and mismarketing the Amiga.Slashdot book review - The Rise and Fall of Commodore by Brian Bagnall ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * ==External links== * Irving Gould * Ars history of Commodore Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Commodore people Category:1919 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century businesspeople sv:Irving Gould ","title":"Irving Gould"},{"id":"9105417","text":"Justin Haber (born 9 June 1981) is a Maltese professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Maltese side G≈ºira United and the Maltese national team. ==Playing careerFloriana=== Born in Floriana, Malta, Haber started his football career at Floriana F.C.

The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, p. 885, ==History== The current name has been in use since the end of the 18th century, when the vineyard was owned by the Saint-Martin family. The property then saw a succession of owners and temporary partition until the estate was largely restored and expanded by Daniel Guestier of Barton & Guestier after 1816. The estate was first mentioned in classification by Abraham Lawton in 1815, as a \\"fifth growth\\" under the name of \\"Bedou\\", and in 1846 by Charles Cocks under the name of proprietor Guestier. By Guestier's death in 1847 Batailley was established as a fifth cru ahead of the 1855 M√©doc classification. Brothers Fran√ßois and Marcel Borie purchased the estate in 1932, and in 1942 divided it into the two properties that are today Batailley and Haut-Batailley, in order to prevent future difficulties with inheritance laws. The larger part, which included the ch√¢teau, became the sole property of Marcel Borie until his death in 1961, when it passed to his daughter Denise and her husband Emile Cast√©ja.

While working at the Ford Motor Company Flat Rock Casting Plant, Williams was killed by an industrial robot arm on January 25, 1979. ==Death and litigation== Joe Clark (June 1973), Ford Motor Company's New Casting Plant at Flat Rock. Photographed for DOCUMERICA. Williams was one of three operators of the parts retrieval system, a five-story robot built by the Unit Handling Systems division of Litton Industries. The robot was designed to retrieve castings from high density storage shelves at the Flat Rock plant. Part of the machine included one-ton transfer vehicles, which were carts on rubber wheels equipped with mechanical arms to move castings to and from the shelves. When the robot gave erroneous inventory readings, Williams was asked to climb into the racks to retrieve parts manually. Another news account states the robot was not retrieving parts quickly enough. He climbed into the third level of the storage rack, where he was struck from behind and crushed by one of the one- ton transfer vehicles, killing him instantly. His body remained in the shelf for 30 minutes until it was discovered by workers who were concerned about his disappearance. His family sued the manufacturers of the robot, Litton Industries, alleging \\"that Litton was negligent in designing, manufacturing and supplying the storage system and in failing to warn [system operators] of foreseeable dangers in working within the storage area.\\" In a 1983 jury decision, the court awarded his estate $10 million and concluded that there simply were not enough safety measures in place to prevent such an accident from happening. He would go down in history as the first recorded human death by robot. The award was raised to $15 million in January 1984. Litton settled with the estate of Williams for an undisclosed amount in exchange for Litton not admitting negligence. Litton had sought indemnification and recovery of judgment costs from Ford because Ford had not sent Williams to Litton-provided training and allowed Williams to enter the rack without engaging the lockout system. Since Litton had already settled with the estate of Williams, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied the action, and that decision was later upheld by the Supreme Court of Michigan. ==See also== *List of unusual deaths *Kenji Urada, (1943/1944-1981) a Japanese man killed by a robot in 1981 == References == ==External links== * Kiska, Tim (August 11, 1983). \\"Robot firm liable in death\\".

KKST-FM Star 98.7 was gone and replaced with KEDG-FM's Urban format, branding itself as 98.7 KISS-FM Alexandria's # 1 For Hip Hop and R&B.; That of course did not spell the end for STAR, because Flinn Broadcasting adopted the hot adult contemporary format on 106.9 branding it as STAR 106.9, The '80s, '90s & Now and ultimately Alexandria's STAR was reborn in a new home.

It is endemic to the Afromontane forests of southern Africa. ==Taxonomy== In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Cape batis in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name Le gobe-mouche du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Muscicapa Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Cape batis. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Muscicapa capensis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name capensis denotes the Cape of Good Hope. The species is now placed in the genus Batis that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1833. Six subspecies are recognised. * B. c. sola Lawson, 1964 ‚Äì northern Malawi * B. c. dimorpha (Shelley, 1893) ‚Äì central to southern Malawi, and Mount Namuli in Mozambique * B. c. kennedyi Smithers & Paterson, 1956 ‚Äì western to central Zimbabwe * B. c. erythrophthalma Swynnerton, 1907 ‚Äì Eastern Highlands in Zimbabwe and Mozambique * B. c. hollidayi Clancey, 1952 ‚Äì Waterberg, Soutpansberg, northern Drakensberg and southern Lebombos in South Africa and Mozambique * B. c. capensis (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì Western Cape to Lesotho and upland KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa ==Description== The Cape batis is strikingly patterned. The adult male has a grey crown, black eye mask and white throat. Its back is brown, with a black rump and tail and rufous wings. The underparts are white with a broad black breast band and rufous flanks. The female and juvenile plumages differ in that the breast band is narrower and rufous, not black, and there is a small rufous patch on the throat. Their rufous wings and flanks distinguish them from other Batis species in the region. The males of the two Malawian subspecies (B. c. dimorpha and B. c. sola) differ in having colder tones to the upper part and flank plumages (lacking any rufous or olive), besides having shorter bills, and are sometimes separated as the Malawi batis (Batis dimorpha). The population of Mount Namuli may represent a third subspecies of this northerly taxon. The song is typically a triple whistle cherra-warra-warra or foo-foo- foo. ==Distribution and habitat== It is resident in cool coastal forests, moist evergreen mountain forests and wooded gorges. It is native to South Africa, Swaziland, the Matobos and Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique, and the mountains of Malawi and those of adjacent Zambia and Mozambique. ==Behaviour== Both the male and the female will aggressively defend their territory. When larger birds of prey, animals or humans approach, the bird will often perch conspicuously near the intruder and angrily protest audibly. The Cape batis hunts by flycatching, or by taking prey from the ground like a shrike. The nest is a small neat cup low in a tree or bush. ==References== == Further reading == * Ian Sinclair, Phil Hockey and Warwick Tarboton, SASOL Birds of Southern Africa (Struik 2002) ==External links== * Cape batis - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.

Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln, who had worked as a laborer splitting wooden rails as a young man, is sitting on top of the pile (believed to have been drawn by Louis Maurer) Nigger in the woodpile or nigger in the fence is a figure of speech originating in the United States meaning \\"some fact of considerable importance that is not disclosed‚Äîsomething suspicious or wrong\\". Commonly used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, usage has declined since then, and use of the phrase by public figures has often been followed by criticism over the racism of the term \\"nigger\\". == Origin == Both the \\"fence\\" and \\"woodpile\\" variants developed about the same time in the period of 1840‚Äì50,\\"nigger, n. and adj., ¬ßP2\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 11 July 2017. when the Underground Railroad was flourishing. The evidence is slight, but it is presumed that they were derived from actual instances of the concealment of fugitive slaves in their flight north under piles of firewood or within hiding places in stone walls.\\"nigger, n. and adj., etymology\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 11 July 2017.\\"Heavens to Betsy\\" (1955, Harper & Row) by Charles Earle Funk Another possible origin comes from the practice of transporting pulpwood on special railroad cars. In the era of slavery, the pulpwood cars were built with an outer frame with the wood being stacked inside in moderately neat rows and stacks. However, given the nature of the cars, it was possible to smuggle persons in the pile itself, possibly giving rise to the term. == Usage == An American film comedy titled A Nigger in the Woodpile was released in 1904, and the idiom was common in literature and film during the 1920s and 1930s. Examples include the original 1927 version of the Hardy Boys book The House on the Cliff (pg. 77), where Frank Hardy uses the expression (removed when the story was revised in 1959), and the old-time band Skillet Lickers recording a song called \\"Nigger in the Woodpile\\" in 1930. Dr. Seuss used the term in a 1929 cartoon \\"Cross-Section of The World's Most Prosperous Department Store\\", wherein customers browse through a department store looking for items to make their lives more difficult. The panels show a series of scenarios based on popular figures of speech: a man with a net trying to catch a fly for his ointment, another looking at monkey wrenches to throw into his machinery, one examining haystacks with matching needles, and finally a man looking at a selection of niggers for his woodpile. The author Zane Grey's 1921 novel The Mysterious Rider uses the expression at least twice throughout the story to explain a situation in which facts were purposefully omitted. In the 1929 RKO film \\"Street Girl,\\" the phrase is spoken by Joseph Cawthorn, but it has been erased from the print that Turner Classic Movies shows. In the 1930 pre-Code comedy Not So Dumb, Marion Davies consistently and constantly convolutes common idioms and expressions. After finally finding misplaced billiard balls that she had used as darning eggs, she proudly exclaims, \\"I just knew there was a woodpile in the nigger when I couldn't find 'em.\\" A visual gag in the Looney Tunes cartoon Porky's Railroad from 1937 refers to the phrase. The phrase is also used in The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham. One of the American characters, on the brink of closing a business deal, says to the narrator, \\"I'll fly down to Texas to give the outfit the once-over, and you bet I'll keep my eyes peeled for a nigger in the woodpile before I cough up any ... dough.\\"The Razor's Edge (Vintage International) (Part Seven, Chapter 3, p. 244). In Chapter 3 of Absalom, Absalom, William Faulkner uses the phrase when referring to the success of a cotton plantation: \\"...some among his fellow citizens who believed even yet that there was a nigger in the woodpile somewhere.\\" Computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra uses the phrase in a published reply to referees ca 1975. https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD470.html In the book Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising that Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education, by Joseph H. Pilates in 1934, page 18 writes, \\"This is the 'Nigger in the wood pile'.\\"Pilates, Joseph H., (1934) Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising that Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education. Published by Joseph H. Pilates. Agatha Christie used the phrase as the title of chapter 18 of the 1937 Hercule Poirot novel Dumb Witness, which was later published in the U.S. as Poirot Loses a Client. The chapter was later retitled \\"A Cuckoo in the Nest\\". A character also uses the phrase in Chapter 22 of her 1953 book \\"After the Funeral\\". The phrase was also used by a character in early editions of Christie's novel And Then There Were None (originally released under the title Ten Little Niggers), but was changed in later editions to There's a fly in the ointment. As late as 1952, in the novel They Do It with Mirrors, published in the U.S. as Murder with Mirrors, she has a character use the phrase. It appears in editions published as late as 1985. In her 1970 novel Passenger to Frankfurt, she has a character use the phrase in chapter 23. Erle Stanley Gardner also uses this phrase in an early Perry Mason mystery, The Case of the Stuttering Bishop (1936) on page 53. W. C. Fields used variations of this phrase in two of his films: In You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939) he said there was \\"an Ubangi in the fuel supply\\", and in My Little Chickadee (1940) he said there was \\"an Ethiopian in the fuel supply\\". In the song, \\"This Could Be True\\", Pat Kirkwood and Graham Payn sing the phrase in No√´l Coward's 1950 musical Ace of Clubs. Popular western author Louis L'Amour used a variant in Crossfire Trail (1954): \\"Now there seemed to be a larger African in the woodpile, or several of them.\\" Popular music group Supertramp used the phrase in the lyrics of their 1971 song 'Potter'. 10cc also used the phrase in their song 'The Second Sitting for the Last Supper' from their album The Original Soundtrack from 1975. The phrase declined in use during the 20th century, and now the occasional use of this phrase by public figures has often been followed by controversy and apology. In July 2008, the leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, was urged to sack Conservative peer Lord Dixon-Smith, who said in the House of Lords that concerns about government housing legislation were \\"the nigger in the woodpile\\". Dixon-Smith said the phrase had \\"slipped out without my thinking\\", and that \\"It was common parlance when I was younger\\". In July 2017, the phrase was again used by Conservative Party politician Anne Marie Morris who said that Brexit without a deal with the European Union was the \\"real nigger in the woodpile\\". She later said \\"The comment was totally unintentional. I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused.\\" However, she was suspended the same day by the party's chief whip, on the orders of party leader, the prime minister, Theresa May. The Conservative Party whip was restored to Morris on 12 December 2017, one day before a crucial vote on the Brexit process. Although Morris voted with the Conservative Government, the Government was defeated by four votes. Also in 2018 it was revealed that Irish race car driver and commentator Derek Daly had used the phrase in a radio interview in 1980. He did so while describing how he was the only non-American on his new race team. Once it was revealed, Derek lost his commentator job. His son also lost his sponsor for the weekend. In 2019, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) ruled that radio station 2GB breached the Commercial Radio Code of Practice when the broadcaster Alan Jones used a \\"racially charged phrase\\" during a segment in 2018. ACMA received numerous complaints after Jones used the controversial phrase in August 2018, while discussing the looming second Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill. \\"The nigger in the woodpile here, if one can use that expression ‚Äì and I'm not going to yield to people who tell us that certain words in the language are forbidden ‚Äì the person who's playing hard to get is Mathias Cormann,\\" Jones told listeners. ACMA found that, while the phrase was widely considered racist, its use in the broadcast didn't likely incite \\"hatred\\", \\"serious contempt\\" or \\"severe ridicule\\". 2GB's management agreed the term will not be used on-air again. In November 2019, a Downing Street aide alleged that Prince Andrew, Duke of York had used the phrase during a trade meeting. In June 2020, a City Councillor in Taupo, New Zealand caused offence by using the term in a public meeting. == See also == * Dog in the manger * Elephant in the room * Wolf in sheep's clothing == References == == External links == *Racist parody of Republican platform from 1860 Presidential campaign, in Harper's Weekly *Epistemology of the Woodpile, University of Toronto Quarterly *History News Network blog post about origins of term *History News Network blog post about a recent controversy *Phrase used in 1918 advertisement for Patterson Publishing Company The Rotarian magazine Category:Words coined in the 1840s Category:English phrases Category:Pejorative terms for people Category:Metaphors referring to people Category:Metaphors referring to objects Category:Obfuscation Category:Secrecy Category:Underground Railroad Category:Negro Category:American English idioms ","title":"Nigger in the woodpile"},{"id":"9105520","text":"Grand Vin 2010 Ch√¢teau Cos Labory is a winery in the Saint-Est√®phe appellation of the Bordeaux region of France.

It follows Riyo, who arrives in Hawaii as a \\"picture bride\\" for a man she has never met before. The story is based on the historical practice, due to U.S. anti-miscegenation laws, of (mostly) Japanese and Korean immigrant laborers in the United States using long-distance matchmakers in their homelands to find wives. Released by Miramax Films, the film stars Youki Kudoh, Akira Takayama, Tamlyn Tomita, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, with a special appearance by Toshiro Mifune in his penultimate film role. Picture Bride premiered at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for narrative feature film. Considered a landmark Asian American work, the film was an Official Selection at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best First Feature (for director Hatta). In 2004, Miramax released a DVD version, which includes \\"The Picture Bride Journey,\\" a documentary on the making of the film featuring the director, cast members, archival historical footage, and behind-the-scenes clips from the movie set. ==Plot== The film is set in 1918. Riyo (Kudoh) is a \\"city girl\\", who becomes a picture bride to a man who works as a field hand on a sugarcane plantation in Hawaii. The story begins with the death of Riyo's father, which leads Riyo's aunt to make arrangements for Riyo to become a picture bride. As Riyo prepares to be photographed, her aunt shows her a picture of the handsome Matsuji (Takayama), her husband-to-be in Hawaii. The photo intended as introduction and as a means of confirming that each has found the right partner when they meet for the first time on the docks. When Riyo finally arrives in Honolulu, the man who comes to greet her looks nothing like the one in the photo. Matsuji confesses that the photo he sent was old, taken when he was a young man. Riyo goes through with the wedding (in a mass ceremony with other \\"picture couples\\") and travels out to the sugarcane plantation that is her new home. As she walks past the darkened fields to their ramshackle house, Riyo hears a faint sound on the wind of a woman singing. When she asks about it, Matsuji half-jokes that the ghosts of the canefields have come to welcome her. That night, they sleep on the same mat, but Riyo fights off his attempts at sexual intimacy and hides beneath a blanket. The next day, after she is given an ID tag to wear around her neck, Riyo goes to work in the sugarcane fields for the first time. She is unfamiliar with farm work and slows the other workers down, leading her to be harassed and ridiculed by Antone (James Grant Benton) the luna (field supervisor). Yayoi (Kati Kuroda) prompts Kana (Tomita) to help Riyo learn. Kana is a picture bride who had arrived several years before. Later, Riyo finds out that Kana's husband, Kanzaki (Tagawa), frequently beats her and goes out gambling. To escape the abuse, at night Kana often brings her baby and sleeps in the fields, singing. One night, after an argument with Matsuji, Riyo runs off into the fields and discovers Kana. Riyo gains Kana's trust and agrees to help her with her side business doing laundry for the workers. Riyo begins industriously doing laundry work and saving her earnings in a tin can, determined to earn her passage back to Japan. Matsuji begins drinking and gambling, saying that he intends to win enough money to get another bride. Kana advises Matsuji to become romantic and to take Rudolf Valentino as a role model to win Riyo's heart. Antone the luna starts to drive the workers to do more work to meet the harvest in time. The women's leader, Yayoi, leaves with her family to Honolulu. As she leaves, she asks Kana to take care of the other women caneworkers. In the fields, Kana and the other mothers are constantly worried about their children, who must be left under a sunshade in the field when the parents are working. Kana tries to stand up against Antone to get the kids moved closer when the workers go to a new field. He threatens to use his whip on the workers, as he had done 'in the old days.' Before harvesting, cane fields are set on fire to burn off the leaves. Antone, in a hurry to get the job done, orders the fire to be set before the women can retrieve their children. Kana's baby daughter, Kei, has wandered into the fields. Kana rushes into the burning field to find her daughter and both are lost. The workers talk about waging a strike. Meanwhile, Riyo continues to hear the sound of a woman singing in the canefields. One night, she leaves the house to follow the sound, and Matsuji follows her. He accuses her of having a secret lover and a chase ensues. Riyo admits that her parents had died of tuberculosis, which at that time carried tremendous social stigma. Although Riyo was healthy, the matchmaker had lied to Matsuji about his bride-to-be's status. That night, when Riyo tentatively reaches out to him as they lie in bed, he brusquely turns away. Betrayed, the next day Riyo gathers her savings and a few belongings and runs away, eventually finding herself at the ocean. Riyo falls asleep there. She is awakened by the sound of singing and glimpses a woman walking among the shoreline rocks. She runs after the vision and encounters Kana, who says she is leaving for Japan. When Riyo asks to go with her, Kana criticizes her, not unkindly, \\"Who waiting for you there?\\" Then, as Yayoi had done when she left the plantation, Kana hands her neck tag to Riyo and tells her \\"Take care of the girls.\\" Kana turns to walk toward the sea, fading out of sight. Riyo awakes and finds Kana's neck tag in her hand. She returns to the plantation and to her house, where she finds Matsuji drunk. She puts him to bed, and he looks at her, saying \\"I thought I was all alone again.\\" Later that night, she hesitantly reaches out to touch his hand, and he reaches back; they embrace. The next day, Riyo surprises the other workers when she begins singing in the fields, as had Kana and Yayoi. Antone tries to make fun of her. She continues singing more strongly, and he realizes that she has picked up the mantle of leadership. Matsuji makes a gift to Riyo of a Buddhist altar, so she can honor her parents. She is touched at his acceptance of her past. The film ends as Riyo, Matsuji, and the other workers dance in a circle at a lively Obon Festival. In a closing voiceover (by Nobu McCarthy), an older Riyo describes how she imagines at times that she hears a woman's voice singing and realizes it is the voice of Riyo's daughter as she sings to her children. ==Cast== * Youki Kudoh - Riyo * Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa - Kanzaki * Tamlyn Tomita - Kana * Akira Takayama - Matsuji * Yoko Sugi - Aunt Sode * Christianne Mays - Miss Pieper * Toshiro Mifune - The Benshi * Jason Scott Lee ==Critical reception== Picture Bride was met with critical acclaim. It has a score of 82% with a certified \\"Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.

The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds. The Leverett J-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor \\\\sqrt{k/\\\\phi} is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii. This function is also widely used in modeling two-phase flow of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.J. M. LaManna, J. V. Bothe Jr., F. Y. Zhang, and M. M. Mench, J. Power Sources 271, 180 (2014). A large degree of hydration is needed for good proton conductivity while large liquid water saturation in pores of catalyst layer or diffusion media will impede gas transport in the cathode. J-function in analyzing capillary pressure data is analogous with TEM-function in analyzing relative permeability data. ==See also== * Amott test ==References== ==External links== * http://www.ux.uis.no/~s-skj/ResTek1-v03/Notater/Tamu.Lecture.Notes/Capillary.Pressure/Lecture_16.ppt * http://perminc.com/resources/fundamentals-of-fluid-flow-in-porous- media/chapter-2-the-porous-medium/multi-phase-saturated-rock- properties/averaging-capillary-pressure-data-leverett-j-function/ * Leverett J-Function in Multiphase Saturated Rocks Category:Petroleum engineering ","title":"Leverett J-function"},{"id":"9105593","text":"Return to Dark Castle is a 2008 platform game for Mac OS X developed by Z Sculpt. It is the third and final game in the Dark Castle series, following Dark Castle (1986) and Beyond Dark Castle (1987). Development on the game, begun in 1996, was notoriously protracted, and the game was often labeled vaporware. Return to Dark Castle was originally scheduled to be released in Winter 2000, but was not released until March 14, 2008. It brought colour to the original black and white graphics, and integrated the gameplay and levels of both the original games. In February 2011, Super Happy Fun Fun, Inc. released an updated version of the game on the Mac App Store that included all 30 original Dark Castle and Beyond Dark Castle levels and added 50 new levels. ==Plot== The player fights his way through various areas, inside and around the Dark Castle, in an attempt to defeat the Black Knight. The player's character, named Bryant by default, is the nephew of Duncan, the protagonist of the earlier Dark Castle games. In the game's intro, we learn that Duncan never returned from his quest to the Dark Castle. Bryant now approaches the castle in an attempt to succeed where Duncan had apparently failed. Bryant must collect 10 orbs hidden around the castle (similar to the orbs from Beyond Dark Castle) before he can confront the Black Knight. If Bryant defeats the Black Knight on any difficulty other than advanced, the Black Knight chides him for wanting an ending but expending too little effort. If Bryant defeats the Black Knight on advanced difficulty, the Black Knight's armor is knocked off, revealing Duncan, now old and with gray hair and beard. Duncan and Bryant are forced to flee the castle, as the Black Knight's armor had imprisoned Duncan, and now threatens to imprison them anew. Duncan and Bryant descend a rope to the Black Knight's Pier, and there board a ship to visit an unnamed destination that Duncan always wanted to see. ==Gameplay== The previous games each had 15 levels, and Return to Dark Castle contains all the levels from these first two games, plus over 50 new levels. The new areas are a mixture of single-screen levels in the style of the first two games, and larger horizontally and vertically scrolling levels. The levels contain 25 orbs, 10 of which are required in order to complete the game. Many of the new levels contain secret areas which can be accessed by activating hidden doors and switches. The game's gameplay is, with a few notable exceptions, essentially identical to its predecessors. Bryant's principal weapon remains the rock which can be magically upgraded to the fireball, and a magical shield can be obtained. New features include the ability to carry weapons in the player's inventory as well as the ability to keep teleportation potions in the inventory. As he explores the castle, Bryant will also come across additional weapons and defenses that were not available in the original game. Unlike the original, Bryant's progress is saved each time he returns to the Great Hall, Ante Room or Ante Room II. (These three interconnected rooms are the \\"starting\\" points for the original Dark Castle, Beyond Dark Castle and Return to Dark Castle, respectively.) This allows a player to save his progress and return later, which is important given the large number of additional levels compared to the original games. Another new feature is the ability to record sessions. These recording files can be shared with others players, although recordings from different versions of Return to Dark Castle are not compatible, and there are playback bugs, particularly in longer recordings. ==Level editor== In December 2002, it was announced that Return to Dark Castle would include a level editor; with this editor, players will be able to make their own levels or even create an entire quest. As released, however, the level editor is not included in the download. The feature would be added in an update released in August 2013, five years after the games release. ==References== ==External links== * Inside Mac Games preview * Z Sculpt Entertainment Category:2008 video games Category:MacOS games Category:MacOS- only games Category:Mac OS games Category:Platform games Category:Dark Castle Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Return to Dark Castle"},{"id":"9105599","text":"Wang Sai Phun (, ) is a district (amphoe) in the eastern part of Phichit Province, central Thailand. ==History== Tambon Wang Sai Phun, Nong Phra and Nong Pla Lai were separated from Mueang Phichit District and made up the new minor district (king amphoe) Wang Sai Phun on 1 August 1975.

Cierva, the engineer responsible for the invention of the autogyro, had spent all his funds on the research and creation of his first five prototypes. Therefore, in 1923, he turned to the Cuatro Vientos Aerodynamics Laboratory chief, Commander Emilio Herrera, who succeeded in persuading General Francisco Echag√ºe, the director of the Military Aviation Aeronautics Department, to take over the second stage in the research and development of Cierva's autogyros. After several wind tunnel tests, Military Aviation built a Cierva C.6 autogyro in an Avro 504 frame. This machine, piloted by Captain Joaqu√≠n Loriga Taboada, made three flights, all of them in March 1924. One of those flights, the eight-minute trip from Cuatro Vientos airfield to Getafe airfield (), was considered a giant step for Cierva's autogyros. The Cierva C.6 prototype was fitted with ailerons mounted on two small wings, also with elevators and a rudder. This complete three-axis control scheme was needed because the pilot had only limited control over the rotor. Only the front propeller was powered, so this aircraft could not hover, and could lose control at low speed. The vertical axis rotor spun freely; the faster the autogyro flew, the faster the rotor would spin and the greater lift it produced. A replica of the Cierva C.6 was built to be shown in Murcia pavilion in Seville Expo '92 World's Fair. That replica can be now be seen in Museo del Aire (Spain), Cuatro Vientos, Madrid, Spain. ==Variants== ;Cierva C.6: Prototype. ;Cierva C.6A: Powered by an Le Rh√¥ne 9Ja rotary piston engine. ;Cierva C.6B: ;Cierva C.6C: Powered by a Clerget 9B rotary piston engine.

Originally released on his 1964 debut album, All the News That's Fit to Sing, \\"Power and the Glory\\" is said to have contributed to Ochs' profound impact. ==History== Singer/songwriter Phil Ochs is said to have \\"spent half his adult life dodging FBI microphones hidden in his soup.\\" By 1963, Ochs was not well thought of by the U.S. government and was deemed one of the harshest critics of the American military and industrial establishment. In that same year, Ochs began writing \\"Power and the Glory,\\" a song that honors the way of life that America symbolized to the world. While composing the song, Ochs told his sister Sonny that he was writing \\"the greatest song I'll ever write\\". The song has been described as an \\"anthem ... with lyrics that might have been written by the great Woody Guthrie\\". Said to be the American patriotic hymn best at combining the American dream with selfless Christian ideals\\"Power and the Glory\\" consists of three verses, each followed by a chorus. The first verse invites the listener to walk with the singer, and it describes some of the natural wonders of the United States. The second verse names some of the states through which the listener and the singer would travel. The third verse notes that the United States is \\"only as rich as the poorest of the poor\\" but also as \\"strong as our love for this land\\". The chorus of \\"Power and the Glory\\" describes the United States as \\"a land full of power and glory\\": A fourth verse, not added to the final production release, but found in a bootleg demo recording and confirmed by Ochs' sister Sonny, contains a call to action: ==Legacy== \\"Power and the Glory\\" is said to have contributed to Ochs' profound impact. \\"Power and the Glory\\" also has been covered by many performers, including Theodore Bikel, Anita Bryant, Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger, The Limeliters, Clem Tholet, and the U.S. Army Soldiers Chorus. Ochs, who was a leftist, was particularly amused by Bryant's cover because of her right-wing political views. In 1974 Ochs re-recorded the song in a new arrangement, with a fife and drum accompaniment, that was influenced by Bryant's version. Ochs' 1974 version was released as a single. In 2018, Billy Bragg wrote that \\"Power and the Glory\\" \\"should be sung in schools across America\\". ==ReferencesCategory:1963 songs Category:1974 singles Category:American patriotic songs Category:Phil Ochs songs Category:Songs written by Phil Ochs Category:Pete Seeger songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jac Holzman ","title":"Power and the Glory"},{"id":"9105671","text":"R23 or R-23 may refer to: ==Chemistry== * R23: Toxic by inhalation, a risk phrase in chemistry * Fluoroform, a chemical compound ==Military== * Rikhter R-23, an aircraft autocannon developed by the Soviet Union * R-23 (missile), a medium-range air-to-air missile developed by the Soviet Union for fighter aircraft * No. 23r, the first of the British 23 Class rigid airships of World War I * , a 1918 R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy ==Roads== * R23 road (Belgium) * R23 road (South Africa) * R23 highway (Russia) ==Cars== * Renault R23, Renault F1's car for the 2003 Formula One season ","title":"R23"},{"id":"9105675","text":"The pink-throated twinspot (Hypargos margaritatus) is an estrildid finch.
