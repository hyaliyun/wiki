Due to escalating tensions between Free State and Republican troops, the barracks were handed over to Republican forces on March 5, as part of a truce agreement agreed between Liam Lynch, Commandant of the Republican Forces, and Commandant General Michael Brennan of the Free State Army. Towards the end of March the barracks was commanded by Connie (Mackey) McNamara. At the height of the Irish Civil War, the barracks was besieged by Free State troops under the command of Commandant General Michael Brennan between the July 15‚Äì20, 1922. In the late evening of July 20, Captain McNamara surrendered control of the barracks to the Free State forces. The bullet holes from the conflict are still visible in the neighbouring houses. The Free State then used the Barracks as a training Depot, and troops there were used in the Cork and Kerry landings in August 1922. The barracks housed forces of the Free State Army through the remainder of the Irish Civil War and for 13 years was home to units of the Southern Command of the Irish Defence Forces. The Barracks was then handed over to the Limerick Corporation in 1935. ==1930s to present== The barracks was then taken over by Limerick Corporation and became their works yard.

WYDOT's stated mission is ‚Äúto provide a safe, high quality, and efficient transportation system.‚Äù With nearly 2,000 employees based in about 60 locations, WYDOT constitutes Wyoming's largest and most widespread state agency. The department is responsible for planning and implementation of road improvement projects, conducting road maintenance, managing driver licenses and motor vehicle programs, supporting airports and aviation, and coordination among its divisions, including the Wyoming Highway Patrol. Wyoming Department of Transportation employees put up a new welcome sign in the Spring of 2017. WYDOT headquarters are located in northwest Cheyenne adjacent to the Central Avenue Interchange (exit 12) on I-25. In addition, road construction and maintenance operations are divided among five field districts, headquartered in Basin, Casper, Laramie, Rock Springs, and Sheridan. WYDOT was formed in 1991, incorporating the Wyoming Highway Department, along with the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission and transportation-related elements of the Wyoming Department of Revenue and Taxation and the Wyoming Public Service Commission. The old Highway Department had existed since 1917, when it was created in response to the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, in which Congress decreed that as a prerequisite for the receipt of federal funds, a state must have a highway department (or similar agency) in place and functioning. Until that time, road improvements were the responsibility of local governments. During the 1920s, as the pace of road improvement picked up, so did the need for maintenance. In Wyoming, the initial maintenance work was very basic in nature and carried on only during the summer. Winter motor travel was practically unknown in those days, consequently the agency's maintenance forces were laid off in the fall of the year, with only a few mechanics retained to overhaul equipment. ==Winter maintenance begins== Winter maintenance and snow removal outside of the mountainous areas was first undertaken on a large scale in the fall of 1929. Some snow removal on a very limited mileage had been carried on since the Department bought its first snowplow in 1923, but the agency had acquired only 13 plows up until 1929. That year, another 33 plows were purchased. By then, it was becoming obvious that taking steps to effective reduce snow drifting and accumulation on the roads was just as important as snow removal. The department began engineering grade raises, wider rights of way, removal of guardrail and similar drift-causing structures, and the first snow fences were erected during this era ==1930s: Paving work accelerated== While during the 1920s, the focus was mainly on ‚Äúgetting out of the mud;‚Äù with improvements consisting of improving drainage and topping roads with gravel. By the 1930s the Highway Department had raised its sights to providing durable all-weather surfacing. An excerpt from the department's 1930 annual report read, ‚ÄúThe construction of ‚Ä¶ low-style surfaces such as gravel shale and crushed stone ... has only provided a temporary solution to the problems of providing adequate highways. Increasing traffic ‚Ä¶ has made it impossible to satisfactorily maintain the traffic-bound gravel road ... There is a continuing loss of surfacing material which is expensive and often difficult to replace.‚Äù Initially, the remedy was ‚Äòoiling,‚Äô whereby heavy asphaltic oil was sprayed atop a layer of gravel or other base material; a process was also referred to as ‚Äòinverted penetration.‚Äù Oiling was soon supplanted by paving with bituminous mix (asphalt),a process still in wide use. Paving with concrete was also performed, albeit on a limited basis initially. (Concrete is now used more commonly, primarily in urban or high traffic rural settings.) By 1939, more than 90 percent of the state highway system had been paved. ==Wyoming Highway Patrol organized== During the 1920s and early 1930s, Wyoming had a state ‚ÄòDepartment of Law Enforcement‚Äô in place, mainly to enforce Prohibition. Over time, agents became increasingly busy enforcing motor vehicle laws, so when Prohibition ended, the need was apparent for some sort of regulation and enforcement authority on the highway with its steadily increasing traffic, including commercial vehicle regulation. In response, the Wyoming Legislature authorized creation of the Wyoming Highway Patrol, effective June 1, 1933. Capt. George Smith, the first Patrol director, was also a visionary, pushing for a state speed limit and a driver licensing law years before they became a reality. Primarily for logistical reasons, the Highway Patrol was affiliated the Highway Department, and that association has continued to the modern day. ==Evolution of Aeronautics Commission's function== The Wyoming Legislature established the Aeronautics Commission in 1937, with an initial focus on conducting search and rescue and enforcing licensing requirements. The role of Aeronautics has evolved to where its Commission's primary job has become one of disbursing state funds to maintain and improve runways and buildings needed for cargo shipping, air taxis and ambulances, military transport, and commercial flights. Federal deregulation of airlines in 1978, as well as Wyoming state government reorganization in the early 1990s, were significant factors in changing the Commission's role and authority. ==Interstate highway construction== After years of planning and no small amount of political maneuvering, construction of the Interstate highway system began after Congress passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. By 1960, interstate construction was going strong in Wyoming. In Wyoming 62 sections of new four-lane highway, encompassing nearly (about two-thirds of the ultimate system) opened to traffic between 1960 and 1969. This busy decade of Interstate construction was topped off on Oct. 3, 1970 with the opening of the Walcott Junction-Laramie segment of Interstate 80. This was longest single section of new interstate opened at one time, not only in Wyoming, but also anywhere in the U.S. The last gap in Wyoming's interstate system was closed in October 1985. Currently, there are of public roadways in Wyoming. WYDOT manages of road, of which only are considered urban highways. There are of interstates in Wyoming.WYDOT Planning Program 2006 Vehicle Miles Traveled Wyoming has 10 intercity bus organizations, serving 38 cities. There are 23 counties within Wyoming which have a total of 41 public transit systems. There are approximately of rail in Wyoming, which are state-owned. Wyoming has nine primary service airports.WYDOT Wyoming has one of the nation's lowest fuel tax rates at 14 cents per gallon, which generates approximately $6.65 million per year.Federation of Tax Administrators ==See also== *List of Wyoming-related topics *Vehicle registration plates of Wyoming ==References *WYDOT homepage *2008 WYDOT Annual Report Category:State departments of transportation of the United States Category:Transportation in Wyoming Category:Motor vehicle registration agencies Category:State agencies of Wyoming Category:Government agencies established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Wyoming Department of Transportation"},{"id":"19345197","text":"Leading Edge Brands is a soft drink marketing and manufacturing company based in Temple, Texas.

He is the son of Bela Andahazi, an aristocratic Hungarian poet and psychoanalyst, and Juana Merl√≠n, of Russian-Jewish ancestry. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Psychology (University of Buenos Aires); he practiced psychoanalysis a few years, while he was working on his short stories. The Fortabat Awards affair In 1996, while Andahazi was the finalist of the Planeta Awards, his novel The Anatomist won the First Prize of the Fundaci√≥n Fortabat. However, the mentor and financial supporter of the contest, Mar√≠a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, announced her \\"disagreement\\" with the decision of the jury, through a request published in most newspapers of Buenos Aires, in which she stated that the novel \\"does not contribute to [the] exalt[ation of] the most high values of the human spirit\\". The Fundaci√≥n respected and implemented the decision of the jury, which included Mar√≠a Ang√©lica Bosco, Ra√∫l Castagnino, Jos√© Mar√≠a Casti√±eira de Dios, Mar√≠a Granata and Eduardo Gudi√±o Kieffer, but the jury was subsequently dismissed by Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat and the literary competitions organized by the Fundaci√≥n Fortabat have not been held again. The Anatomist was published by Editorial Planeta in 1997, translated into over thirty languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide. Further works and activity His second novel, Las piadosas (The Merciful Women), a Gothic fantasy set in Geneva, exploring the relationship between Lord Byron, his secretary Polidori and Mary Shelley, was published in 1998.

The author wrote the beginning of a text, asking the readers to continue the story, create characters, propose plots, solve riddles, to be sent by e-mail. Therefore, in an unprecedented work, reading and answering thousands of e-mails per week, Andahazi built the story with the various inputs and points of view. Every Saturday a new chapter was added to the novel, increasing the participation and the expectation of readers turned co-authors. In 2006, Federico Andahazi was awarded the Planeta Prize for his novel El conquistador (\\"The Conqueror\\"). There he narrates the story of Quetza, the brilliant son of Tenochtitlan, who discovers the European continent.

He styled a campaign of \\"new ideas\\" on the model of Gary Hart's 1984 presidential run. Some observers also saw similarities to Robert Redford's role in the 1972 film The Candidate, especially when Shapiro's campaign commercials used the slogan, A Better Way, also used in the film. Shapiro defeated four other candidates in the Democratic primary: State Senate majority leader John F. Russo, Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson, former State Senator Stephen B. Wiley, and former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Robert Del Tufo.

Even public railway lines built for constructional or industrial purposes were counted as Kleinbahnen. == Origin and use == The concept was defined in the Prussian Kleinbahn law of 28 July 1892, that was designed to encourage the construction of local railway lines by private companies. The word Kleinbahn was chosen by a majority of MPs in the Prussian parliament instead of a range of other options - Lokalbahn (local line), Bahn unterster Ordnung (line of the lowest order) or Bahn untergeordneter Bedeutung (line of secondary importance) - because it was neither a foreign word nor had negative overtones. In several former German states such as (Mecklenburg, Oldenburg and Baden) the concept Kleinbahn was partially adopted for lines of limited length and light construction. In the other German-speaking states, the terms Lokalbahn (Baden, Bayern, Austria), Sekund√§rbahn (Saxony) or Vizinalbahn (Bayern) were preferred. In everyday speech the term Kleinbahn is widely used as a synonym for narrow gauge lines or garden railways. Despite that, Kleinbahnen may be built in either as well as in narrow gauge. == Construction and operation == The construction and operation of Kleinbahnen were carried out to less stringent requirements, e.g. tracks were laid in a gravel rather than a normal ballast bed, and usually by private companies, which nevertheless in many cases involved substantial participation by the state, the province or local communities. The Kleinbahn company with the largest railway network in the whole of the German Empire was the 'Pomeranian state railways' (Pommerschen Landesbahnen) founded in 1940. == Today == Except in Berlin, the Kleinbahn law has been superseded everywhere by new national railway laws. The former Kleinbahnen are classified today as Nebenbahnen (branch lines). == Model railway == Kleinbahn model train Blauer Blitz The name Kleinbahn, German for \\"small railway\\", is also the name of a model railway manufacturer based in Vienna. The company was founded in 1947 by Erich Klein. The HO-scale models produced by the company are destined primarily for the Austrian market: most of the models are based on Austrian Railway prototypes. Their current catalogue offers a selection of locomotives; passenger and freight rolling stock; track and switches as well as catenery and signaling equipment. Kleinbahn produces an economically priced product that is readily affordable to a wider market. Kleinbahn has eschewed extreme detail and sophistication and has instead focused on the development and manufacture of models of a simpler and more robust finish. The models are not widely available as they are not available through the usual hobby shops. Instead, their product is available almost exclusively through company outlets located in a number of Austrian cities, including Vienna, where the company is headquartered, as well as Salzburg, Klagenfurt, Linz, and Bregenz, all in Austria. Their products may also be purchased by mail order. Unfortunately, since the time of this writing, all of Kleinbahn‚Äôs stores, with the exception of their ‚Äúflagship‚Äù store in Vienna have been shuttered. However, their models are still available by ‚Äúmail‚Äù order.

They existed between 1942 and 1944 (after 1943 they were part of the Home Army). == Beginnings == The idea to create the UBK was conceived among Warsaw‚Äôs conspirational circles in early 1940s. Altogether, eight battalions were formed, and their task was to engage the Germans in Polish countryside, especially in the Eastern Borderlands of Poland. First attempt to organize armed resistance took place in October 1942. Members of the 1st Battalion, under Captain Ignacy Telechun (nom de guerre Toporski), after concentration in the forests north of Warsaw, headed towards northern Podlasie, where they wanted to set a base. However, their forces were not strong enough and after several skirmishes with the Wehrmacht, the unit returned to Warsaw. They lost 36 men - 4 killed, 2 wounded and 30 captured. == Campaigns == During winter of 1942/43, the UBK carried out preparations for future actions. In January 1943, a patrol under Ryszard Reiff (Jacek) set towards Ciechanowiec, where the 1st Striking Partisan Platoon was created. After some time, the Platoon was renamed into the 8th Battalion. In late May 1943, UBK, with permission of the headquarters of the Home Army, concentrated its forces (200 men) around Wyszkow. The Germans soon found out about it and surrounded the Poles. A skirmish ensued, in which 4 Poles were killed and 8 wounded. German losses were estimated at 15 killed and 22 wounded. Those who were not caught, divided themselves into two groups and headed north, to Bezirk Bialystok. On June 11, 1943, the UBK forces under Major Stanislaw Pieciul (Radecki) of the 4th Battalion engaged the Germans near the village of Pawly (Bielsk Podlaski County). 25 Poles and approximately 40 Germans died. In July 1943 the UBK units, active in Bezirk Bialystok, consisted of five Battalions. Altogether, there were 200 fighters, and during a number of skirmishes with the Germans (including the 1943 Polish underground raid on East Prussia), 138 of them were killed. These heavy losses were criticized by the headquarters of the Home Army, who claimed that the UBK was profusely using lives of young Polish soldiers. On August 17, 1943, upon the order of General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, the UBK was included into the Home Army. Soon afterwards, all battalions were transferred to the area of Nowogrodek. During process of reorganization of the Nowogrodek Area of the Home Army, the UBK units created a battalion, which became part of the 77th Infantry Regiment of the Home Army, under Boleslaw Piasecki. In February 1944 the battalion had around 700 soldiers (some sources put the number at around 500). The unit took part in the Operation Tempest, fighting the Germans around Lida and Wilno (see: Wilno Uprising), where it suffered heavy losses. == Dissolution == On July 17, 1944, the NKVD officers invited Wilno command of the Home Army for negotiations, arresting them immediately. After this, the former UBK dissolved, and those soldiers who came from Central Poland decided to get back to their homeland. == See also == * Polish contribution to World War II == References == * Ze wspomnien zolnierzy AK Okregu Nowogrodek, oprac.

His research is influenced by, and a contribution to, the scientific tradition of the Delft School of Microbiology. Kuenen studied at the University of Groningen, where he received both his Doctorandus degree and in 1972 his Doctorate (PhD) under the supervision of Professor Dr. Hans Veldkamp. The title of his thesis was ‚Äò‚ÄòColourless sulphur bacteria from Dutch tidal mudflats‚Äô‚Äô. After a short post-doc at the University of California in Los Angeles (USA), he returned as a senior lecturer to Groningen. In 1980, he moved to Delft to become the 4th Professor of Microbiology (succeeding M.W. Beijerinck and A.J. Kluyver) at Delft University of Technology. Kuenen's initial research interests were (the application of) bacteria involved in the natural sulfur cycle and yeast physiology and metabolism. His later interest in the (eco)physiology of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria has led a.o. to the discovery of the bacteria within the phylum planctomycetes that perform the Anammox process. In addition, his research has been focussed on (halo) alkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from soda lakes. Gijs Kuenen retired in 2005 but remains active in science. == Awards == In 2004 Gijs Kuenen became a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, In 2005 he was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. In 2006 he received the Jim Tiedje Award for his outstanding contribution to microbial ecology at the 11th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology in Vienna and in 2007 he was awarded the Procter & Gamble Award in Applied and Environmental Microbiology. For his contribution to the founding of the education Life Science and Technology (Delft University of Technology and Leiden University) in 2005 he received an honorary membership of Study Association LIFE. ==Named after Kuenen== One of the five known anammox genera, with the single member Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, has been named after Kuenen. The Kuenen lab had named the first discovered species Brocadia anammoxidans, after the company Gist- Brocades (now DSM Gist), for which Kuenen did consulting work and in which wastewater the bacteria was discovered. == References == *van Caulil G.

Tan developed cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth, and moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of three. She took up horse riding at age of five years as a form of physiotherapy. She subsequently completed her A-levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School, a residential special school for the deaf, and graduated with an honours degree from Oxford Brookes University in hospitality management and tourism. In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at Hartpury College in Hartpury, Gloucester, in England in July that year. At this event, her first international competition, she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre at Sha Tin, she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class Ia). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games. Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008. On 2 September 2012, Tan won Singapore's first medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, a bronze in the dressage Individual Championship Test (class Ia). She followed this up with a silver medal in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) on 4 September. For her achievements, Tan was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) by the President in November 2012. ==Early years and education== Laurentia Tan was born on 24 April 1979 in Singapore.. She moved with her family to London at the age of three years due to her father's work... Tan developed cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth, and doctors informed her parents that she would probably not be able to walk. Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as they felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there. When she was in school, she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her \\"Trouble\\". At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders. in London as a form of physiotherapy. This activity also helped her confidence and self-esteem.. Tan completed her A-levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School, a residential special school for the deaf, where she was a prefect. She also won an Elizabeth Dyson Prize for progress and achievementCompare . and a prize for business studies.. From the age of 18, she stopped horse riding for eight years to pursue an honours degree in hospitality management and tourism at Oxford Brookes University, and for a job as a mental health worker. However, she missed the sport and took it up again in 2005. Tan said, \\"For me, riding a horse gives me the freedom, movement and energy that my own legs cannot do.\\" ==Sporting career== Tan took up riding in October 2005 at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders, where she met her coach Heather \\"Penny\\" Pegrum. Encouraged to participate in dressage competitions in March 2006, she quickly progressed to the Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA) Nationals that year. In March 2007, RDA Singapore contacted Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships 2007, which was a qualifier for the 2008 Summer Paralympics.. The event, Tan's first international competition, was held at Hartpury College, Gloucester, in England in July 2007. She achieved 63% or higher in both her Team and Individual Tests, qualifying her to be selected for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. In the Freestyle to Music Test, despite her profound deafness, she was placed fourth in a field of 18 riders with a best score of 67.94%.. In October 2007, Tan went to Singapore for a visit and trained daily at Singapore's RDA with volunteer coach Sally Drummond. Tan resigned her job in June 2008 to train full-time with her coach Penny Pegrum and physiotherapist Anthea Pell. 2008 Summer Paralympics Tan's first Paralympic event was the para-dressage Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riders in this event are categorized into classes I to IV, those in class I having the most severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old chestnut gelding loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as Harvey) at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre in Sha Tin, Tan scored 68.80% to claim the bronze medal behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she performed to music with Nothing To Lose.. The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as \\"beyond our expectations\\", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport..See also ; ; ; . Tan's win sparked discussion about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore. A correspondent to the Straits Times criticized the fact that the newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had \\"focused almost primarily on her disability\\".. Another letter writer to my paper expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the Singapore women's table tennis team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.. See also , which also appeared as . In addition, a Today reader noted that Tan would be receiving S$25,000 for her bronze medal, a tenth of the S$250,000 that table tennis players Feng Tianwei, Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu received for their silver medals. He felt that she should receive even more than them, given what she had achieved in spite of her disabilities.. The President of the Society for the Physically Disabled, Ms Chia Yong Yong, commented that the disparity between the cash awards given to able-bodied and disabled sportspeople was \\"disconcerting\\" and looked forward to a single common scheme, because: Singaporean Paralympians Eric Ting Chee Keong, Jovin Tan Wei Qiang, Tan and Yip Pin Xiu at a Paralympics Celebration Ceremony at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard on 20 September 2008 On 16 September, Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen asked in Parliament if there was a difference in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians. Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a per capita basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the current financial year compared to S$54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794 registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16 disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently... See also ; . He said that the government was looking at how it could \\"develop a system to accommodate all athletes that represent Singapore\\". Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008.; . At an appreciation dinner on 21 November 2008, the Singapore National Paralympic Committee (SNPC) announced that it was increasing the monetary awards under its Athlete Achievement Award scheme for Paralympic Games medallists in individual and team events, a quarter of which would be paid to the SNPC towards developing elite athletes and sports. As a result, for her Paralympic win, Tan received a cash reward of S$37,500, S$12,500 of which went to the SNPC.; . She made it into Today newspaper's list of athletes of the year for 2008 in eighth place,. and shared the Her World Young Woman Achiever 2008 award with Paralympian swimmer Yip Pin Xiu.; . 2012 Summer Paralympics On 2 September 2012, Tan won Singapore's first medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, a bronze in the dressage Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riding on Ruben James 2, a gelding from Germany she had only known for ten months, she scored 73.650 percentage points.; . See also . Two days later, on 4 September, she scored 79.000 in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) which brought her a silver medal.; ; . Her wins brought her prizes of $50,000 (for her bronze medal) and $100,000 (silver) from the SNPC's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme, again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive.; ; . Twenty per cent of the prize money will be paid to the Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development.

The first round was \\"Solo Wall\\" which saw each team's guest players take a turn to face a wall just on their own. For each wall, 10 points were given to the player for a pass while a fail could be given up to 5 points depending on the host's whim. Next was the \\"Captain's Challenge\\" or \\"Captain's Mate\\" which could be one of a number of games: *Doubles - The captain and a chosen teammate of his choosing (usually, the one they are encouraged to do so by the studio audience) both attempt a wall. A maximum of 20 points was on offer. *Props - The captain must complete the wall with a prop. This round made its first appearance when Anton Du Beke successfully cleared a wall on a space hopper. *Mirror Wall - The captain must attempt a wall backwards (facing the swimming pool) leaving his two teammates communicate to him about the shape he needs to make. *Blind Wall - The captain is blindfolded and his team members have to instruct to him the shape he needs to make. The third round was \\"Mystery Guest or Killer Question\\", the team leading being offered the choice of which game they wished to play and the currently losing team playing the other challenge. A maximum of 20 points was on offer. *Killer Question - Two players face a wall without cut-outs with a question written at the top and two answers marked as doors. The \\"door\\" with the correct answer on it, is perforated on the reverse side and so gives way. The players must pass through the correct door. *Mystery Guest - One of the team attempts a wall with a mystery guest (or several). The fourth round was the \\"Team Wall\\". All three players face the wall with a maximum of 30 points on offer. The programme's finale was the \\"Mega Wall\\". The leading team got to choose to attempt the wall or nominate the opposition. All three players on the team attempt the wall, which travels at double speed - if they clear the wall, they win the show (and the ¬£10,000 to donate to a charity of their choice), while if they fail, the opposing team wins The ¬£10,000. Hole in the Wall used a specialised crane made by Street Crane Company of Chapel-en-le-Frith to move the wall. Series 2 changes Series 2, which started on 26 September 2009, contains all new challenges. Solo Wall returned with the Captain's Challenge changing its name to Captain's Mate, as now the captains had to be blindfolded. The Mystery Guest section was eliminated (although, it made appearances in Anton's Twist). Killer Question was now named Wonder Wall (with both teams now playing it as opposed to just one team), and a new challenge named Anton's Twist debuted. Team Wall also returned. The Mega Wall was renamed the Great Wall. Anton's Twist, according to Anton, involved walls he'd invented with a twist. Variations could be any number players with various twists (such as placing leg braces around the legs of team members commonly used in three-legged races), or the appearance of a mystery guest. Notably, one episode had Anton announce a mystery guest for Joe Swash's team, and Joe asked, \\"Is it my mum?\\" It turned out it was his mother, but the two failed the wall (although they still scored points for the team). ==Production== Series 1 was recorded at BBC Television Centre in White City, West London, with series 2 seeing the show relocating to BBC Pacific Quay in Glasgow as part of an out-of-London production plan. For series 2, the show was also shot in high-definition. The first series had the entire audience off to the left side (from the perspective of the cameras looking straight at the wall), with the team benches on the other side, and the scoreboards by each bench. Winton, Du Beke, and Gough (as well as their teammates) would emerge from the left side when introduced, while the mystery guest(s) emerged from a platform below stage that rose to the top when introduced. For the second series, the audience was placed on three sides of the set, and the scoreboards were placed on the floor, hence Anton's catchphrase: \\"The scores on the floor are...\\" ==Episode guide== : -- Won by red team (Anton du Beke/Joe Swash) : -- Won by blue team (Darren Gough/Austin Healey) Series 1 {  width=\\"99%\\" style=\\"left: 0 auto; text-align: center;\\" !

There are numerous hand- powered versions around the world and one surviving steam-powered example in Bristol Docks, England. ==Innovative design== Fairbairn's patent curved platework jib Maker's plate for Stothert & Pitt. This photograph also shows the distinctive double rows of rivets that make up 'chain riveting.' The crane's innovation was in the use of a curved jib, made of riveted wrought iron platework to form a square-section box girder. This curved jib could reach further into the hold of a ship, clear of the deep gunwales alongside the quay. Designing a strong curved jib required Fairbairn's advanced theoretical understanding of the mechanics of a box girder. The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a box girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling. The first of these cranes were a batch of six built for the Admiralty at Keyham and Devonport. These were hand-operated and could lift 12 tons to a height of and a radius of . The size of the crane jibs was determined by ships of the period, and their lifting capacity by men's ability to raise the load. Experiments at Keyham with loads of up to 20 tons showed the jib design to be sound, and that the jib at least was capable of handling loads of up to 60 tons. A \\"colossal\\" crane of 60 tons was later built at Keyham, with a cell plate stiffened by four cells. This crane was worked by four men driving through a gear train of 632 times, which must have been hard and slow work at full capacity. As the capacity of the crane was so obviously limited by its motive power, not its strength, they were an obvious candidate for steam power ‚Äì as was later re-applied to the 60 ton crane at Keysham. There was even a proposal for a high crane, to replace masting sheers at Woolwich. A more typical size for most of these later cranes though would be able to lift 35 tons at a radius of . They were powered by self-contained steam engines, with both boiler and engine mounted on board the crane. William Fairbairn & Sons of Manchester built a number of these cranes and also licensed the design to other makers. After the expiry of the patent in 1875, other companies, notably Cowans Sheldon & Co of Carlisle, built many others as late as 1910, often powered by steam, water hydraulics or electricity. They were particularly favoured in naval dockyards for fitting battleship guns; Hong Kong had a battery of four. == Bristol == Gearing inside the cab, showing a cast-in \\"S&P;\\" mark The only surviving Fairbairn steam crane is in Bristol, on the quayside at Princes Wharf. It is in the care of M Shed.  Construction  In the 1870s, Bristol Docks was going through a period of expansion and modernisation in the face of increasing competition from other ports. Iron-hulled ships were becoming larger, cargoes heavier, and there had already been investment in building a railway line along the harbour quay. Crane capacity was limited though ‚Äì none of the harbour's 17 cranes being able to lift more than 3 tons. Accordingly, a more powerful steam crane was ordered, to be capable of lifting 35 tons and loading it directly onto a railway wagon. This was ordered from local makers Stothert & Pitt in 1875, although to the Fairbairn pattern. As for the later Fairbairn cranes, the original cell plate was changed to a design of a single flat plate stiffened by riveted T section ribs, rather than the original cellular structure. In August 1878 the crane had been completed and tested, at a cost of ¬£3,600 for the machinery, plus the masonry foundations. The jib has a radius (reach) of and a height of . The crane weighs 120 tons. A vertical boiler inside the cab operates at 100 psi and supplies two twin-cylinder steam engines: one for slewing (turning) the crane, a larger one for winding the lifting chain. The winding drums can be driven by their gearing at four different speeds. The jib box girder extends below ground in a well for . A plain bearing at the foot of the well carries the weight of the crane and roller bearings beneath the cab resist tipping loads. Water for the boiler is supplied by a pump, which originally drew water straight from the dock and is also used for draining the well. The boiler's maker's plate reads \\"Marshall Sons & Co. Ltd., Engineers, Gainsboro, England, No.92766\\"; it is the fourth boiler that has served the crane and was installed in 1953. The cab of the crane is also of iron, with small-paned windows. These window frames are decorated with small roses cast into the junctions of the glazing bars. Some time around 1900 the top winding drums and gears were enclosed in a further box on the roof.  In service  Although mechanically capable, the crane was not a great success commercially. In 1890 it was only used for 16 days of the year, for a profit of just 11s. 6d. Ships had increased in size by this time and the jib could no longer reach far enough to remove engines or boilers for repair work. It was even considered raising the crane up on a stone tower, as for the smaller crane at Canons Marsh opposite, to increase the lift height. In 1892, hydraulic machinery, including cranes, appeared in the docks. These used a powerful central power supply and could transfer cargoes more quickly. In 1906 electric cranes appeared too. The steam crane was required less and less often; for a whole year between April 1905 and April 1906 the crane went unused. From 1903 to 1909 it made a total of 143 lifts. It remained useful for heavy loads, however. During World War II the crane's heavy capacity came into its own. A Landing Craft Flotilla Unit was stationed on Princes Wharf, and over 1000 new assault landing craft were delivered by road for adaptation for use in the Far East. The crane was used to unload the lorries and to launch the craft after completion, a total of over 2000 lifts in three years.  Today  The crane is still operational and is regularly steamed. With the gradual closure of the City Docks, in 1973 the crane was passed to Bristol City Museum. In 1976 it was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument, as the last surviving Fairbairn steam crane. From 1988, it was restored to operational condition as part of the Bristol Industrial Museum. The crane operates on special museum days, such as bank holidays and the Harbour Festival. The Seville crane == Seville == A hand-cranked example survives in Seville, Spain. == Dover == Wellington Dock in Dover, the crane to the right Another Fairbairn crane survives at Dover, on the quayside of Wellington Dock. It is now a scheduled ancient monument. This is a hand-cranked crane of 1868, built by the Fairbairn Engineering Company of Manchester. When originally installed it was rated at 50 tons and worked by four men. The Ordnance Department of the Royal Navy used it for handling cannon. In later years it was down-rated to 20 tons and was used for lifting yachts from what was now Dover Marina. In 2014 the crane was 'lovingly restored' and repainted, with an obtrusive vertical steel prop beneath the jib. == References  External links == * Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery * M Shed * Flickr Fairbairn crane group Category:Steam cranes Category:Individual cranes (machines) Category:Bristol Industrial Museum Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Bristol Category:Bristol Harbourside ","title":"Fairbairn steam crane"},{"id":"19345695","text":"Frederick Douglas Underwood (February 1, 1849 ‚Äì February 18, 1942) was president of the Erie Railroad from 1901 to 1926 and a director of Wells Fargo & Company. ==Early life== Underwood was born in 1849 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, the son of Enoch Downs Underwood and Harriet Flint (Denny) Underwood. He attended the public schools of Wauwatosa and Wayland Academy, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. In 1867 he entered the employ of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, rising from clerk and brakeman to division superintendent. In 1875, he married Sara Virginia Smith, by whom he had two sons, Enoch William and Russell Sage Underwood. They were divorced in 1886, and in 1893 he married Alice Stafford Robbins.Two Great Lakes ships would eventually receive the name Alice Stafford: a Lake Michigan passenger steamer of 859 gross tons, built at Benton Harbor, Michigan, in 1882 as the Lora and renamed Alice Stafford in 1897, and a tug of 141 gross tons, built in 1914 at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, for the Erie Railroad for service in the Chicago River. ==Railroad career== In 1886 Underwood was named general superintendent of the Minneapolis and Pacific Railway. Before the end of the year he was superintendent of construction of its successor, the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (Soo Line). Soon after promoted to general manager, he supervised the building of nearly 1,300 miles of line. There was a great rivalry between the Soo Line and James J. Hill's St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, but Hill came to respect Underwood's ability, and the two leaders worked out a compromise. When Hill had become a major shareholder in the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, he secured the appointment of Underwood as vice president and general manager in 1899. However, with control of the B&O; by the Pennsylvania Railroad in the offing, Underwood accepted J. Pierpont Morgan's offer of the presidency of the Erie Railroad in May 1901. Underwood served as president of the Erie for 25 years. He was very involved in the day-to-day workings of the railroad and became known as \\"F.D.\\" among the Erie's employees. During his tenure he made good use of limited financial resources to rebuild the long-troubled Erie as a first-class railroad, especially as a freight carrier. From 1920 to 1926 he was also chairman of the executive committee. A number of executives who served under him went on to fame in their own right, most notably Daniel Willard. Underwood retired from the Erie in 1926. Elected a director of Wells Fargo & Company on January 2, 1902, Underwood served on the board until the company ceased express operations in 1918. He was appointed managing director of Wells Fargo in May 1910, but relinquished the post in November of that year. The 340-foot, 3,045-ton package freighter Ramapo, built in 1896 at Buffalo, New York, was renamed F.D. Underwood by the Erie Railroad in 1910. Although sold to the Great Lakes Transit Corporation in 1916, the steamer continued to carry Underwood's name until she was sold for scrap in 1940. ==Later life== A licensed captain, Underwood owned three yachts in succession. He was also an early automobile owner. He owned two farms, one in Wauwatosa and another in Farmington, Minnesota; usually he spent his summers at the latter. Underwood retired as president of the Erie Railroad on December 31, 1926. He died of pneumonia at his home at 151 Central Park West, New York City, at the age of 93 on February 18, 1942. == Notes References== Category:1849 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Erie Railroad Category:Wells Fargo Category:People from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin Category:People from Beaver Dam, Wisconsin Category:People from Farmington, Minnesota Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Frederick Douglas Underwood"},{"id":"19345724","text":"Jeanne-Marie Busuttil (born 29 June 1976) is a former professional golfer from France who was a member of the LPGA Tour in the early 2000s. == Amateur career == Busuttil was born in Paris, France and moved to America where she attended the University of Florida and Arizona State University, playing on teams for both schools.

The star was identified as a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association by Thomas Preibisch and coauthors in 1998, and originally assigned an age of years old based on its group membership. A more recent analysis of the ages of the stars in the Upper Scorpius group pegs its average age at 11 million years. == Stellar characteristics == This star was identified as a young object belonging to the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association in two papers published in 1998 and 1999, based on its lithium abundance, X-ray emission, and position in the H‚ÄìR diagram. The spectrum of 1RXS J160929.1-210524 reveals it to be cooler than the Sun with a spectral type that has been estimated at K7 or M0, so the star can be considered an orange dwarf or a red dwarf. The star is estimated to be around 0.85 times as massive as the Sun and to have an effective temperature of 4,060 K. The Upper Scorpius association is quite young and only stars earlier (hotter) than type A3 have reached the main sequence; less massive stars, such as 1RXS J160929.1‚àí210524, are still in the process of contraction during the pre-main sequence phase. Originally, the association was estimated to be around 5 million years old, but a recent 2012 paper made a significant revision of this value to 11 million years, which is therefore considered to be the age of 1RXS J160929.1-210524. == Planetary system == On 8 September 2008, it was announced that astronomer David Lafreni√®re and collaborators used the Gemini Observatory to take pictures of the star which appeared to show a planet (designated 1RXS J160929.1-210524 b). The apparent planet is very large‚Äîabout eight times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting the star at a distance of (roughly or miles). The orbital status of the companion planet was confirmed in a paper submitted on 2010 to The Astrophysical Journal. This made it the smallest known exoplanet orbiting its host at such a distance. It is also the second announced directly imaged exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star (after GQ Lup b), and the 2nd directly imaged exoplanet to have spectrum taken (after 2M1207b). The discoverers note that the object's location far from its star presents serious challenges to current models of planetary formation: the timescale to form a planet by core accretion at this distance from the star would be longer than the age of the system itself. One possibility is that the planet may have formed closer to the star and migrated outwards as a result of interactions with the disk or with other planets in the system. An alternative is that the planet formed in situ via the disk instability mechanism, where the disk fragments because of gravitational instability, though this would require an unusually massive protoplanetary disk. With the upward revision in the age of the Upper Scorpius group from 5 million to 11 million years, the estimated mass of 1RXS J1609b is approximately 14 Jupiter masses, i.e. above the deuterium-burning limit. An older age for the J1609 system implies that the luminosity of J1609b is consistent with a much more massive object, making more likely that J1609b may be simply a brown dwarf which formed in a manner similar to that of other low- mass and substellar companions. A 2013 study, using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, detected a moderate excess of infrared radiation at 24 Œºm coming from this system, indicating the presence of a dusty debris disk, but could not determine whether the excess was coming from the star or the substellar companion (or both). In 2015, observations with the Magellan Clay Telescope found evidence that the light from the substellar object is obscured and reddened by 4.5 visual magnitudes of circumstellar extinction, which indicated that the object is surrounded by a dusty disk responsible for the infrared excess. When considering the extinction in modeling the object's spectrum, its effective temperature was increased to 2,000 K and the spectral type to L2. == See also == *Lists of exoplanets == References  External links == * * *Astronomy Picture of the Day ‚Äì Companion of a Young, Sun-like Star Confirmed ‚Äì 2010 July 4 Category:K-type main-sequence stars Category:Pre- main-sequence stars Category:Scorpius (constellation) Category:Hypothetical planetary systems Category:T Tauri stars Category:Exoplanets detected by direct imaging Category:ROSAT objects Category:Upper Scorpius ","title":"1RXS J160929.1‚àí210524"},{"id":"19345838","text":"The Parker Building was a 12-story office and loft structure completed in 1900 at the southeast corner of Fourth Avenue and 19th Street, in Manhattan.

The building was designed by architects Delano and Aldrich of New York City.Art Gallery Planned, New York Times, August 22, 1904, pg. 7. It became the Walters Art Museum.Maryland: A New Guide to the Old Line State, Earl Arnett, Robert J. Brugger, Edward C. Papenfuse, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, pg. 298. ==Business records== The Parker Building was sold by the John H. Parker Company through the C.E. Harrell & Company. The Parker Building was purchased by a group of Chicago, Illinois' capitalists for a price between $1,700,000 and $1,800,000. It was located on a large plot measuring 131 by 150 feet in size. The land it occupied was owned by the Matthews estate and passed into the hands of the Cameron Company in 1897. The Parker Company paid some $700,000 for the ground in August 1899.In The Real Estate Field, New York Times, June 13, 1900, pg. 12. In October 1900 C.E. Harrell & Company leased approximately 30,000 feet of floor space in the Parker Building to the Kay Scheerer Company, a seller of surgical instruments and hospital supplies.In The Real Estate Field, New York Times, October 16, 1900, pg. 12. ==Destroyed by fire== The Parker Building and the adjacent Florence Hotel were burned irreparably by a fire which began on the sixth floor of the Parker Building, on January 10, 1908. A night watchman discovered the flames in rooms occupied by the Detmer Woolen Company. The hotel was separated from the Parker Building by a narrow alley measuring fifteen feet. The conflagration began around 7 p.m., and by 11 p.m. the Parker Building was gutted.Three Firemen Dead In $5,000,000 Blaze, New York Times, January 11, 1908, pg. 1. It was erroneously reported that the fire was started by members of an Armenian Hunchakist sect which was targeting the A & M Karagheusian company, a rug importing firm, located on the fourth floor of the Parker Building. Mihran Karagheusian was threatened by Parseg Nevrovzyan several months prior to the fire. Nevrovzyan vowed to inflict $200,000 in damages to the Karagheusian business, but did not name the Parker Building in making his threat. Nevrovzyan was arrested. He promised to reveal to the Turkish government a revolutionary plot which he claimed Karagheusian's brother, Arshag, was interested in. Arshag resided in Constantinople.Parker Fire Not Incendiary, New York Times, January 20, 1908, pg. 6. ==References== Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:Office buildings in Manhattan Category:Building fires in New York City Category:1900 establishments in New York (state) Category:Burned buildings and structures in the United States Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:Commercial building fires Category:Park Avenue ","title":"Parker Building (New York City)"},{"id":"19345856","text":"United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1 (1977), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that, absent exigency, the warrantless search of double-locked luggage just placed in the trunk of a parked vehicle is a violation of the Fourth Amendment and not justified under the automobile exception. The Court reasoned that while luggage is movable like an automobile, it does not have the lesser expectation of privacy associated with an automobile.. Chadwick was later abrogated on other grounds by California v. Acevedo (1991),. in which the Court overruled Chadwick's holding with respect to containers within a vehicle, holding that police may search a container within a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the container itself holds contraband or evidence. The holding in Chadwick that a search incident to arrest must not be too remote in time or place is still good law. ==Case== Respondents had recently stepped off a train and were putting a suitcase into the trunk of a car when they were stopped by federal agents. Federal agents had probable cause to arrest the respondents and to believe that the suitcase contained narcotics. The respondents were arrested. About an hour and a half after the arrest, the agents opened and searched the suitcase without a warrant. == Holding == In order to search a locked container that is in the exclusive possession of law enforcement officials, those law enforcement officials must get a warrant (unless an exception applies). In this case, an exception did not apply. == Subsequent Jurisprudence == After California v. Acevedo (1991), this protection no longer applied to people in automobiles because people in automobiles have a diminished expectation of privacy. However, it still applies to people walking on the street. ==Applications== *People v. Diaz, 51 Cal. 4th 84, 244 P.3d 501, 119 Cal.

The company catered to the middle-class consumer. ==History== The company was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1914, when Mortimer Slater, with Charles Anson Bond and Lester Cohen, founded the stores as a retail outlet for their suit manufacturing company. Charles Anson Bond, whose name was chosen for its market value and meaning left Cleveland for Columbus, Ohio where he opened a branch of the company. Bond stepped away from active management when he was elected Mayor of Columbus in 1907. The first store featured fifteen-dollar men's suits. As president Slater built the concern into a million-dollar corporation, increasing the number of employees from fifty to more than 4,000. At his retirement in 1924, the concern had twenty-eight stores in large cities. Charles Anson Bond also sold his interests in the 1920s. Bond Stores, Inc. was organized in Maryland on March 19, 1937, by the consolidation of Bond Clothing Company, a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiary, Bond Stores, Inc. The principal executive offices of the corporation were located at 261 Fifth Avenue in New York City.Harvard Business School, Lehman Brothers Collection - Twentieth-Century Business Archives Bond Stores,Inc. historical collection (accessed September 16, 2008).

United States, 113 U.S. 648 (1885), was an action brought by the appellant on April 13, 1869 to recover a balance alleged to be due as compensation for collecting and delivering to the United States a large amount of cotton in bales which was captured and abandoned property within the meaning of the acts of Congress. He claimed to have performed the services in question under an arrangement or agreement with an agent of the US Treasury Department which the Secretary of the Treasury subsequently recognized as a valid contract with the government. He admits certain payments on his claim, and asks judgment for the further sum of $80,000. The court below dismissed his petition.. == Background == The precise form in which appellant's claim for compensation was presented at the Treasury Department is not shown by the findings of fact. The orders given in 1865 by the assistant Secretary for the statement of an account and a requisition in favor of the claimant discloses the fact that Camp had collected the cotton \\"for an interest therein,\\" and that the payment of $30,000 was intended as an advance to him on account of his expenditures in relation to the cotton, while the payment of $15,000 to Smith was \\"on account of his joint interest with Camp in said cotton.\\" But this falls far short of an agreement by the Department to make further payment. These facts, at most, imply necessarily nothing more than that the Department was willing under the circumstances to compensate him to the extent of the foregoing sums. Whether he should receive any compensation or how much should be awarded him were matters which depended, as we have seen, upon the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. No one acting by his authority had bound the government to make compensation. If the Secretary refused to pay anything, the claimant had no remedy except to apply to Congress for a special appropriation in his behalf. The mere payment of $45,000 on a claim for a much larger sum as compensation for services rendered in delivering captured or abandoned property to the government‚Äîfor which services it was under no legal obligation, express or implied, to make compensation‚Äîcannot be deemed a recognition of a legal liability to make further payments on such claim. We find in the record no evidence of any purpose or agreement upon the part of the Secretary of the Treasury to make compensation to claimant beyond that already allowed, and to say that the court may award such compensation as it deems just and proper is to impose upon the government the obligations of a contract in respect of captured or abandoned property which, under the acts of Congress, only the Secretary of the Treasury or such agents of the Department as he designated for that purpose had authority to make. ==Judgment== These views made it unnecessary to consider other questions argued by counsel, and lead to an affirmance of the judgment. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 ==ReferencesCategory:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:1885 in United States case law Category:Cotton industry ","title":"Camp v.

United States (1925) laid down the automobile exception which allowed for warrantless searches of automobiles; on the other hand, Chadwick did not allow for a warrantless search of luggage. Sanders declined to extend the automobile exception here, again stressing, as in Chadwick, the heightened expectation of privacy in one's luggage. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 442 *United States v.

She played camogie at various times with her local clubs St. Paul's and Austin Stacks and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1970 until 1987. Neary is regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time. In a senior inter-county career that lasted for nineteen years she won seven All- Ireland medals, five National League medals and five Gael Linn Interprovincial medals. With her two clubs St. Paul‚Äôs and Austin Stack‚Äôs she collected a huge haul of twenty-one county titles and six All-Ireland club medals. Neary was also presented with a number of personal awards during her career. In 1981 and 1986 she was honoured with the B&I; Player of the Year Award. In 2004, she was named on the Camogie Team of the Century. ==Biography== Liz Neary was born in Kilkenny in 1951. She was educated locally and later attended the Presentation Secondary School, Kilkenny. It was here that her camogie skills were first developed. Neary captained the school to the All-Ireland Colleges‚Äô title in 1970. ==Playing career== Club Neary played most of her club camogie with the famed St Paul‚Äôs camogie club in Kilkenny and enjoyed much success. When the club disbanded in the early 1990s she had already collected twenty county titles. During this period Neary also won six All-Ireland club titles, the first of which came in 1970. She won the last of her six All-Ireland club medals nineteen years later in 1989. Downey later joined the Austin Stacks club in Dublin and enjoyed further success by winning yet another county medal. Inter-county Neary was still in secondary school when she first played senior camogie with Kilkenny in 1968. By 1972 she was a key member of the team and she lined out in her first championship decider. Cork provided the opposition again and it was ‚Äòthe Rebel‚Äô ladies who captured a 2-5 to 1-4 victory. Two years later in 1974 Kilkenny were back in the All-Ireland final and, once again, Cork were the opponents. Both sides ended level with Kilkenny scoring 3-8 and Cork scoring 4-5. The replay took place a few weeks later. Kilkenny won by 3-3 to 1-5 and Neary captured her first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny surrendered their All-Ireland crown in 1975, however, Neary lined out in a third All-Ireland final in 1976. On that occasion Kilkenny took on Dublin. A close game followed with neither side taking a definite lead. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the winners by 0-6 to 1-2. It was Neary‚Äôs second All-Ireland medal. In 1977 Neary was a key player in Kilkenny‚Äôs quest for back-to-back All-Ireland titles. That year she lined out in the All- Ireland final once again. Wexford, the winners of the championship two years earlier, provided the opposition. Kilkenny won on a score line of 3-4 to 1-3. It was Neary‚Äôs third All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny went into decline for the next few years; however, Neary added a National Camogie League medal to her collection in 1980. It was Kilkenny‚Äôs first title in that competition. This victory acted as a launch pad for further All-Ireland success. In 1981 Neary was appointed captain of the Kilkenny senior camogie team. That year Kilkenny squared up against Cork in the championship decider. After an exciting game both sides ended with 3-9 apiece. The replay was not as exciting, however, it was more conclusive, Kilkenny won that game by 1-9 to 0-7 with Neary collecting a fourth All-Ireland medal. She also lifted the O'Duffy Cup. She was later named as the B&I; Player of the Years. All-Ireland success was slow in coming over the next few years; however, Neary won a second National League medal with Kilkenny in 1982. Three years later in 1985 she collected a third winners‚Äô medal in that competition. Kilkenny later qualified for another All- Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion; however, they faced a Kilkenny team that was on the verge of dominating camogie for the bones of the next decade. The final ended with a 0-13 to 1-5 victory for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô, giving her a fifth All-Ireland medal. 1986 saw Neary being appointed captain again. That year she guided Kilkenny to a second consecutive All- Ireland final. For the second year in-a-row Dublin provided the opposition, however, once again the result was the same. Kilkenny were much too strong for ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô and won the game by 2-12 to 2-3. It was Neary‚Äôs sixth All-Ireland title while she also joined a club of players that had captained their county to more than one All-Ireland victory. Neary was later named B&I; Player of the Year. In 1987 Neary added a fourth National League medal to her collection after Kilkenny got the better of Dublin in yet another national final. Later that year Kilkenny qualified for the All-Ireland final. It was an historic occasion as Downey‚Äôs side were hoping to capture a third All-Ireland title in- a-row, something that Kilkenny had never achieved. Cork stood in their way, however, Kilkenny gave a great performance in the final. The full-time score of 3-10 to 1-7 gave Kilkenny the victory and gave Neary a seventh All-Ireland medal.

It forms clumps of bright green leaves which are glossy, flat, linear, about in length and wide; its leaves remain green or at least greenish throughout winter. The leaves can also help to differentiate the plant from similar-looking plants in the closely related genus Juncus, as scattered white hairs can be found along the leaf edges. Its tepals are , with flowers which grow in groups of 3 or 4. From mid-spring to summer, L. sylvatica produces flowers in open panicles which are very small, chestnut-brown in colour and can be found in dense and lax clusters. L. sylvatica is sometimes stoloniferous. Luzula sylvatica is both anemophilous and entomophilous, in that it can be pollinated by either wind or insect. L. sylvatica's fruit is a 3-valved capsule containing three oblong seeds. Each seed is indistinctly reticulate, often with a caruncle (a basal or apical appendage); seeds tend to germinate close to their parent plant. == Distribution and habitat== Luzula sylvatica has a wide distribution, and is native to Europe (the European temperate element of flora ) and southwest Asia \\\\- including the British Isles where L. sylvatica populations are widespread stable, apart from a decline in central and south east England. There is one record of L. sylvatica from Washington state, United States. Usually growing in partial to full shade, Luzula sylvatica tends to grow on acidic soils in damp habitats. L. sylvatica can be found on stream banks and well-drained, open woodland, as well as in open ground and rock ledges and peaty heath moors. Despite its preference for acidic soils, it can tolerate most soil pH levels. == Ecology == The leaves of Luzula sylvatica are picked in winter by golden eagles to line their eyries. The flowers and seeds of L. sylvatica are also the sole food source for the larvae of the Coleophora sylvaticella moth. == Uses == Luzula sylvatica is commonly used in horticulture ‚Äî its thick, patch-forming habit (which allows the plant to act as a weed suppressant), hardiness, as well as the ability to grow in shade and damp soils being particular boons; L. sylvatica is commonly used for ground cover and/or as an ornamental grass.

Inspired by John Fox, Jr.'s 1908 novel of the same title, the song expresses the singer's love for his girl, June, who lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The chorus is:MacDonald, \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" (Sheet music). :In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, :On the trail of the lonesome pine-- :In the pale moonshine our hearts entwine, :Where she carved her name and I carved mine; :Oh, June, like the mountains I'm blue-- :Like the pine I am lonesome for you, :In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, :On the trail of the lonesome pine. It appears to have been first recorded in New York on 28 March 1913 by the Spanish-American tenor Manuel Romain and released in June of that year on issue number 1743 of the Edison Blue Amberol Record label. The song was featured in Laurel and Hardy's 1937 film Way Out West. It was performed by Laurel and Hardy with The Avalon Boys and featured a section sung in deep bass by Chill Wills, lip-synced by Stan Laurel in the film, with the last two lines in falsetto (sung by Rosina Lawrence) after Ollie hit Stan on the head with a mallet. This stage routine was performed by actors Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly as part of the 2019 biographical film Stan & Ollie. In 1975, at a time when Laurel and Hardy films were popular on British television, the UK branch of United Artists Records produced an album of dialogue and songs, Laurel & Hardy ‚Äì The Golden Age Of Hollywood Comedy, that included \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\". Released as a single, the song reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, thanks largely to being championed by disc jockey John Peel on his Radio 1 evening show. The song was also recorded by Vivian Stanshall and (as \\"Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia\\") by Tokyo Blade. The song is featured in the stage play The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine, and is played during the opening credits of the 1936 film adaptation.

He plays as flanker but can also play at number eight. ==Club career== Wood, who was educated at the Woodlands School and Sports College, Coventry, made his debut for Worcester Warriors against Bath in the opening round of the 2007‚Äì08 Guinness Premiership. Earlier in his career he spent some time in New Zealand and played for provincial team North Otago. Wood was on the losing side in the final of the 2007-08 European Challenge Cup. In January 2010, Wood agreed to join the Northampton Saints. He was awarded the 2011 Aviva Premiership Player of the Season award and was shortlisted by the Rugby Players' Association for their Players' Player of the Year award alongside Chris Ashton, Chris Budgen, Nick Evans, Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu and Thomas Waldrom and for their Young Player of the Year award alongside Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes, Joe Marler, Charlie Sharples and Manu Tuilagi. Wood captained Saints to both the European Rugby Challenge Cup and Aviva Premiership trophies as the side completed its double winning season, collecting both titles within eight days of each other. Named club captain for the 2016/17 season, Wood lead the side through a tough season which ended in Saints fighting to secure a final place in European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2017/18 season, despite beating Harlequins on the final day of the regular season. Despite their win, Saints had to continue their quest for top-tier European rugby and face Connacht Rugby in the European Champions Cup play-off semi-final. Beating Connacht convincingly, Saints turned their attentions to the play-off final and Stade Francais. Despite Wood receiving a red card in the proceedings, Saints went on to score a last minute try and secure the win and therefore the final place in the European Champions Cup for the following season. ==International career== In January 2010, Wood made his debut for the England Saxons, against Ireland A. Tom Wood made his debut for England against Wales in Cardiff in the opening game of the Six Nations, on 4 February 2011. He then played in the victories against Italy and France. Wood was named in the 30-man squad for England in the Rugby World Cup later that year, but started only one game against Georgia. Upon Stuart Lancaster's appointment as interim Head Coach, speculation mounted that Wood might be named captain for the 2012 Six Nations. However, a foot injury saw him miss both the Six Nations and England's tour to South Africa in the summer. Wood returned to the side in the end-of-year internationals, starting fixtures against South Africa and New Zealand. His performance in England's 38-21 victory over New Zealand saw him named Man of the Match. The 2013 Six Nations saw Wood start at blindside flanker in the opening fixture against Scotland, but move to Number 8 for the remaining four fixtures following an injury to Ben Morgan. Wood was named captain for England's tour of Argentina in the summer, leading the side to a 2-0 series victory whilst playing in his usual position at blindside flanker. Wood was named to start for all three games in the following end-of-year internationals.https://www.northamptonsaints.co.uk/news/latest- headlines/archive/wood-leads-england-to-first-ever-pumas-whitewash/ The flanker played for England during the 2015 Rugby World Cup as the side dropped out of their home World Cup in the pool stages. Wood missed out on an England selection in the coming years but was re-called to the squad under Eddie Jones and helped the nation to end their losing streak against the Springboks in 2016 as well as hold onto their Six Nations title the following year while earning his 50th international cap. ==Playing style== Wood is capable of playing across all three back row positions, but is typically used at blindside flanker for his country. His abrasive style of play sees him featuring heavily in defence, frequently putting in high tackle counts and helping slow opposition ball at breakdowns. His height and athleticism also sees him used frequently as a lineout jumper. ==References * Northampton Saints profile * England profile Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:Worcester Warriors players Category:Sportspeople from Coventry Category:Rugby union flankers Category:North Otago rugby union players ","title":"Tom Wood (rugby union)"},{"id":"19346436","text":"ADONE (big AdA) was a high-energy (beam energy 1.5 GeV, center-of-mass energy 3 GeV) particle collider.

Houghton, 526 U.S. 295 (1999), is a United States Supreme Court case which held that absent exigency, the warrantless search of a passenger's container capable of holding the object of a search for which there is probable cause is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because it is justified under the automobile exception as an effect of the car.. ==Background== In Houghton, the Supreme Court was confronted with the question of whether the scope of a vehicle exception search included a passenger's purse. The car had been stopped by a police officer for a faulty brake light, and the driver was promptly observed to have a syringe in his shirt pocket. He admitted he used it to shoot up. A backup police car soon arrived, and the passengers were ordered out of the car. Ms. Houghton gave a false name. While looking through her purse, an officer found her driver's license and, thus, her real name. Continuing the search, the officer found a syringe with 60 ccs of methamphetamine. Looking at her arms, he saw fresh needle tracks. She was arrested.In her purse, there were two separate containers in which drugs and drug paraphernalia were found. She disclaimed any ownership interest in one of them. The trial court denied her motion to suppress and she was convicted. On appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court reversed because the officers lacked probable cause to search her purse simply based on the driver's possession of a syringe. == Opinion of the Court == The Supreme Court reversed, 6‚Äì3. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, stated that all Fourth Amendment inquiries look first to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution. If that does not provide an answer, then \\"we must evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\\" Looking to Carroll v. United States, the first automobile exception case from 1925, the Court found there that the Framers would hold that the whole car could be searched if there was probable cause to believe it contained contraband. Likewise, the Court opined in United States v. Ross that the Carroll doctrine permitted searches of all containers found in a vehicle there was probable cause to search.Houghton, 143 L.Ed.2d at 415, quoting Ross, 456 U.S. at 820 n. 26: > It is noteworthy that the early legislation on which the Court relied in > Carroll concerned the enforcement of laws imposing duties on imported > merchandise... . Presumably such merchandise was shipped then in containers > of various kinds, just as it is today. Since Congress had authorized > warrantless searches of vessels and beasts for imported merchandise, it is > inconceivable that it intended a customs officer to obtain a warrant for > every package discovered during the search; certainly Congress intended > customs officers to open shipping containers when necessary and not merely > to examine the exterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled goods might be > concealed. During virtually the entire history of our country--whether > contraband was transported in a horse-drawn carriage, a 1921 roadster, or a > modern automobile--it has been assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle > would include a search of any container that might conceal the object of the > search. Going one step further, however, the Court held that even if the historical perspective was not enough, a \\"balancing of the relative interests weigh decidedly in favor of allowing searches of passenger's belongings\\" because of the reduced expectation of privacy in and the mobility of automobiles. Also, passengers in cars are more likely engaged in a common enterprise with the driver and \\"have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.\\" Also, their proximity enables them \\"to hide contraband in [each other's] belongings as readily as in other containers in the car ... perhaps even surreptitiously, without the passenger's knowledge or permission.\\" While these factors will not always be present, \\"the balancing of interests must be conducted with an eye to the generality of cases.\\" Thus, specific probable cause to the container was not required.  Dissent  Justice Stevens, the author of Ross, dissented with Justices Souter and Ginsburg. He found that precedent did not dictate the result, and he noted that Ross \\"categorically rejected the notion that the scope of a warrantless search of a vehicle might be 'defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted. ... Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.'\\" Since there was no dispute there was no probable cause to believe that Houghton's purse contained contraband, the search should have been suppressed. The dissenters also disagreed with an effective presumption that persons in a vehicle would be holding each other's evidence or contraband. Finally, the dissenters disagreed with elevating law enforcement interests over privacy concerns and that the \\"two-step Fourth Amendment approach wherein the privacy and governmental interests at stake must be considered only if 18th-century common law 'yields no answer'\\" because nothing cited by the Court mandated that approach and the Court did address the contemporary privacy interests involved. Indeed, United States v. Di Re dictated that Carroll did not permit a search of a passenger where there was no probable cause. == See also == * Arkansas v. Sanders, * California v.

It was operative during both World War I and World War II. ==Establishment and early service== Founded on 1 August 1917 at RAF Montrose, equipped with the Sopwith Camel and intended as a fighter squadron, 80 Squadron was sent to France to serve on the Western Front in January 1918, acting initially in a fighter role.Rawlings Air Pictorial December 1962, p. 392. However, German offensives in March of the same year resulted in 80 Sqn being reallocated in a ground-attack role, still with Camels. It continued this duty until the end of the war. As a result, the squadron had only one ace, Harold Whistler, although it claimed approximately 60 aerial victories. The Camels were replaced with Sopwith Snipes in December 1918 and in May the following year the squadron moved to Egypt, where it served for a short period of time before being amalgamated into No. 56 Squadron RAF. ==Reinstatement and World War II== Palestine, June 1941. The squadron was reformed in March 1937 again as No. 80 Squadron, now equipped with Gloster Gauntlet fighter. However, by now the Gauntlet was considered by many to be outdated, and as a result the Gauntlets were replaced by the Gloster Gladiator just two months later. In 1938, the squadron again returned to Egypt as an 'air defence unit'. After Italy's declaration of war on Britain on 10 June 1940, No. 80 Squadron was moved to the Egyptian-Libyan border but was subsequently one of the units sent to aid the Greeks during the Greco- Italian War, initially flying Gladiators and then re-equipping with the Hawker Hurricane from February 1941.Roald Dahl, 'Going Solo'. The Squadron lost most of its aircraft during the Greek and Crete actions and reformed at RAF Aqir in Palestine in May 1941 before deploying detachments to Nicosia in Cyprus and 'A' Flight to Haifa. The Squadron moved totally to Cyprus in July 1941, before returning to Syria the next month, and then joining the fighting in North Africa two months later. During the Battle of El Alamein it was responsible for defending communications lines. It remained in that area until early 1944, when it returned to Britain to prepare for Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Europe). It was equipped with the Spitfire IX F operating from RAF Detling in Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB), though under the operational control of RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF).Delve, p. 137. When 2nd TAF began moving to Normandy after D-Day, the squadron remained in ADGB, re- equipping with Hawker Tempest aircraft on anti-V-1 flying bomb duties as part of Operation Diver. After this threat diminished, No. 80 Squadron moved on to the continent and resumed a fighter role until the end of the war in Europe. ==Post-World War II and disbandment== As part of the European occupation forces, British Air Forces of Occupation, the squadron continued its patrol and reconnaissance duties from Wunstorf in Germany, until it relocated to Hong Kong in July 1949 (the Tempests having been replaced by Supermarine Spitfire F.24s in 1948). During the Chinese Civil War, No. 80 Squadron's main duty was to defend Hong Kong from perceived Communist threats. The Spitfires departed in 1951, replaced by the de Havilland Hornet, and the squadron remained in Hong Kong until being disbanded on 1 May 1955. However, two months later it was reformed as a reconnaissance unit at RAF Laarbruch. Equipped with Canberra PR.7s, it moved to Br√ºggen in June 1957 from then until 28 September 1969, when it was disbanded.Rawlings 1982, p. 92. ==Notable members== * David Coke * Nigel Cullen * Roald Dahl * William Vale * Pat Pattle * Tap Jones ==Aircraft operated== {  ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"From ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"To ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Aircraft ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Version -  Aug 1917  Dec 1918  Sopwith Camel  -  Dec 1918  Feb 1920  Sopwith Snipe  -  Mar 1937  Mar 1937  Gloster Gauntlet  Mk.II -  Mar 1937  Nov 1940  Gloster Gladiator  Mk.I -  Jun 1940  Aug 1940  Hawker Hurricane  Mk.I -  Nov 1940  Mar 1941  Gloster Gladiator  Mk.II -  Feb 1941  Jan 1942  Hawker Hurricane  Mk.I -  Jan 1942  Apr 1943  Hawker Hurricane  Mk.IIc -  Apr 1943  Apr 1944  Supermarine Spitfire  Mk.Vc -  Sep 1943  Jan 1944  Supermarine Spitfire  Mk.IX -  Jan 1944  Apr 1944  Supermarine Spitfire  Mk.Vb -  May 1944  Aug 1944  Supermarine Spitfire  Mk.IX -  Aug 1944  Jan 1948  Hawker Tempest  Mk.V -  Jan 1948  Jan 1952  Supermarine Spitfire  F.24 -  Dec 1951  May 1955  de Havilland Hornet  F.3 & F.4 -  Aug 1955  Sep 1969  English Electric Canberra  PR.7 }Jefford 2001, p. 52. ==See also== *Cathay Pacific VR-HEU ==References== Notes Bibliography * Ken Delve, D-Day: The Air Battle, London: Arms & Armour Press, 1994, . * Halley, James J.

He was born in Cuba as the son of O'Farrill y Arriola of Irish descent. In Spain, Gonzalo became (at the time of King Carlos IV of Spain), a lieutenant general of the Royal Spanish Army, Director of the Military College at Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, Cadiz, Spain, and a Plenipotentiary Minister representing Spain in the Kingdom of Prussia under King Frederic. He was also a member and President of the Supreme Joint Council of Spain when King Carlos IV went to Bayonne, France to meet with Napoleon I Bonaparte around March 1808. Minister of War under King Carlos IV of Spain, he was for a few days (3-19 March 1808), between two spells in power of Pedro Cevallos, Prime Minister of Spain under King Jos√© I Bonaparte. He remained Minister of War under Bonaparte. After the collapse of French power in Spain, he emigrated to France and had all his properties in Cuba confiscated. He died in 1831 and is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. He had married a widow, Ana Rodr√≠guez de Carassa who already had a child, Pedro Miguel Saenz de Santamar√≠a. == Don Gonzalo O'Farrill, the uncle of \\"la Bella Condesa Cubana\\" Maria Theresa == The daughter of his sister Mar√≠a-Josefa Josefa O'Farrill y Herrera was the sensual Cuban lady, Maria Teresa Montalvo y O'Farrill, (1771‚Äì1812), She became a widow in 1807, aged 36 with two very young daughters, described as the \\"Santa Cruz\\" girls, and moved to Madrid. Her Literary Salon at Madrid became very popular with visitors such as the poet Manuel Jose Quintana and the famous painter Francisco de Goya. It is said that at the time she was supposed to be the Spanish love of the new Bonaparte family King of Spain, Jos√© I Bonaparte, whose wife, Julie Clary, apparently preferred a less risky position and stayed in France with their two daughters. Maria Teresa Montalvo y O'Farrill died in 1812. The next year when Napoleonic troops suffered successive defeats, her two daughters together with their great uncle Gonzalo O¬¥Farrill, left for Paris. Mercedes Santa Cruz y Montalvo had married around October 1809, aged 20, with French invading General Antoine Christofe Merlin, a. k. a. Merlin de Thionville, then in his early forties, who was Captain General of the Spanish Royal Guards two months before their wedding. Her sister Mar√≠a Josefa de Santa Cruz y Montalvo was married to another \\"Afrancesado\\", Pedro Miguel S√°enz de Santa Mar√≠a y Carassa, the step son of General Gonzalo O'Farrill y Herrera, and a member of the State Council of the \\"new King\\" Jos√© I. ==The Spanish-Cuban aristocrats exiled from Madrid to Paris== Maria Mercedes, left her husband French General Merlin de Thionville, and had an affair with Philar√®te Chasles. She also played hostess to French intellectuals. Her translation into Spanish from the French of \\"Viaje a La Habana\\" had a prologue by the notorious Spanish-Cuban romantic school poet Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda, then living in Spain. However her hopes of getting back land, money, houses and titles confiscated by the Spanish Bourbons while she lived in exile, in particular, her appeals around 1845 to Queen Isabella II of Spain for restoration of her titles and properties did not lead anywhere. ==References== *http://wwwcirobianchi.blogia.com/2007/121601-dos-habaneras-de-ayer.php * List of Prime Ministers of Spain *http://www.dtcuba.com/ShowReport.aspx?c=174 The dtcuba URL describes the former palace of the O¬¥Farrill family in La Habana, Cuba, now a hotel.

This exercise is an isolation exercise that heavily works the posterior deltoid muscle. The movement is primarily limited to the two shoulder joints: the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic joint. Scapular movement will also cause movement in the sternoclavicular joint and acromioclavicular joint. If the elbow bends during the extension exercises, it gravitates into a rowing motion. ==Transverse forms== Movements for the posterior deltoid done in the transverse plane are also referred to by terms like rear delt fly, reverse fly, rear lateral raise, bent-over lateral raises or other variations. Other muscles that aid the posterior deltoid include the two lateral rotators of the rotator cuff: the infraspinatus and teres minor. Other muscles such as the lats and middle delts can also come into action, dependent on how the shoulder is rotated. To execute the exercise, the weightlifter attains a prone rib cage position. This is usually done by standing and bending over, or by laying face-down on a bench. Flat is ideal, though slight inclines can also be used. The arms hang straight down. The goal is to bring the arms to the side away from the body at a 90 degree angle. While leverage is most difficult with fully extended elbows, a slight bend is useful as it allows the lifter to maintain awareness of this. This movement is commonly done using dumbbells to add resistance to the weight of the arms. It is mostly a joint isolation movement of the shoulder. During the transverse lifts, the scapulae will also articulate and adduct/retract as the weights lift, then abduct/protract as the weights are lowered. Some lifters will retract the scapulae and hold them there, as opposed to letting them protract, to get a better stretch in the posterior deltoid. Muscles that retract the scapulae include the rhomboid muscle and the trapezius muscle.

The palms should be facing inward, moving to face towards the ground as the arms raise. Due to the external (lateral) rotation, the work is shifted forward and the lateral head of the deltoid assist the lateral rotators in transverse abduction.Muscles used during transverse abduction The arms have the same orientation relative to the ground as in the \\"shoulder fly\\" which is done to target the lateral deltoid. The difference is that the angle of the torso changes, and the change in the shoulder's rotation and angle of movement relative to the body means the lateral head is a synergist rather than the prime mover. Back-flyes-with- resistance-bands-2.pngBilateral band fly begin Back-flyes-with-resistance- bands-1.pngBilateral band fly end Bent-over-cable-lateral- raises-2.pngUnilateral cable raise begin Bent-over-cable-lateral- raises-1.pngUnilateral cable raise end Cable-seated-rear-lateral- raise-2.pngBilateral cable fly begin Cable-seated-rear-lateral- raise-1.pngBilateral cable fly end Due to the lateral rotation, the elbows point inferior towards the lifter's hips throughout the movement, as opposed to pointing outward/upward as they do in transverse extension. Ligaments that stabilize and prevent deformation of the elbow joint are involved due to the angle of lateral force on the outside of the joint, much as medial forces on the inside of the joint are involved in transverse adduction (chest fly variations). If the lifter does not lock the elbow, the lateral rotators (posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, teres minor) are also involved in preventing internal (medial) rotation. The more the elbow is bent, the more leverage gravity has pull the hand down and turn into a transverse extension angle. A bent elbow can allow greater weight to be lifted, and may shift the work of transverse abduction more heavily onto the lateral head of the deltoid as the prime movers work to prevent internal rotation. Transverse extension The forearm should have a neutral grip, the back of the hand should be superior and the palm should be inferior. The elbows should be pointed towards the scapulae. The Latissimus dorsi muscles aids the lateral rotators in transverse extension.Muscles used during transverse extension The anconeus muscles and triceps brachii muscles are involved isometrically in keeping the elbow straightened. To keep the focus on the rear deltoid when lifting, it is imperative to keep the elbows away from the body and avoid torso movement, This ensures ideal isolation. The posterior fibers are usually undertrained for many and do not require heavy weights at first. A compound variation is the bent over row done with a wide overhand grip that allows the elbows out, as opposed to the elbows-in lat-targeting variation. This is also referred to as a \\"rear delt row\\" as opposed to a \\"raise\\". Bodyweight/supine rows (or \\"australian pullups\\") can also be done with a wide overhand grip to target the rear delts. It requires less work by the lower back and legs to stabilize. Barbell-rear-delt-row-1.pngBarbell rear delt row begin Barbell- rear-delt-row-2.pngBarbell rear delt row end Body-row-2.pngSupine rear delt row begin Body-row-1.pngSupine rear delt row end The above variation is most difficult when the muscle is maximally contracted, and allows both arms to be worked out at once. To emphasize the contraction in a stretched position using a weight, the arms must be worked unilaterally. The exerciser rotates the side he is working toward the ceiling and lies on the opposite side. The resistance meets its peak when the humerus is parallel with the ground.Lying rear delt raise To attain a similar effect, it is common to use a cable crossover variation to the rear lateral raise, which allows the angle to be done on both sides simultaneously and without lying on one's side, which can be uncomfortable for some people.Cable Rear Lateral Raise ==Hyper extension form== Rear-deltoid-row-2.pngDumbbell hyperextension row start Rear-deltoid- row-1.pngDumbbell hyperextension row end Another option for doing a raise to target the posterior deltoid is hyperextending the glenohumeral joint. The lat is no longer an extensor at this point, so it is primarily the posterior deltoid and long head of the triceps that perform hyperextension. The range of motion for this is very limited, most people can't even hyperextend 45 degrees. This is also a static-active stretch for the anterior deltoid and biceps. A compound variation is a behind the back row. This row, when performed with a barbell, has also been called a rear delt raise. ==References== Category:Weight training exercises ","title":"Rear delt raise"},{"id":"19346562","text":"Jordan Page (born 11 March 1987) is a former English rugby union] player for Leeds Tykes, Worcester Warriors and Stourbridge . ==External linksReferences== Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Sedgley Park R.U.F.C. players Category:Stourbridge R.F.C. players Category:Worcester Warriors players Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jordan Page (rugby player)"},{"id":"19346578","text":"Ruth S.

This concept is closely related with other notions of entropy found in dynamical systems and plays an important role in differential geometry and geometric group theory. If the manifold is nonpositively curved then its volume entropy coincides with the topological entropy of the geodesic flow. It is of considerable interest in differential geometry to find the Riemannian metric on a given smooth manifold which minimizes the volume entropy, with locally symmetric spaces forming a basic class of examples. == Definition == Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold, with universal cover \\\\tilde{M}. Choose a point \\\\tilde{x}_0\\\\in \\\\tilde{M}. The volume entropy (or asymptotic volume growth) h=h(M, g) is defined as the limit : h(M,g) = \\\\lim_{R \\\\rightarrow + \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{vol} B(R) \\\\right)}{R}, where B(R) is the ball of radius R in \\\\tilde{M} centered at \\\\tilde{x}_0 and vol is the Riemannian volume in the universal cover with the natural Riemannian metric. A. Manning proved that the limit exists and does not depend on the choice of the base point. This asymptotic invariant describes the exponential growth rate of the volume of balls in the universal cover as a function of the radius. == Properties == * Volume entropy h is always bounded above by the topological entropy htop of the geodesic flow on M. Moreover, if M has nonpositive sectional curvature then h = htop. These results are due to Manning. * More generally, volume entropy equals topological entropy under a weaker assumption that M is a closed Riemannian manifold without conjugate points (Freire and Ma√±√©). * Locally symmetric spaces minimize entropy when the volume is prescribed. This is a corollary of a very general result due to Besson, Courtois, and Gallot (which also implies Mostow rigidity and its various generalizations due to Corlette, Siu, and Thurston): :: Let X and Y be compact oriented connected n-dimensional smooth manifolds and f: Y -> X a continuous map of non-zero degree. If g0 is a negatively curved locally symmetric Riemannian metric on X and g is any Riemannian metric on Y then ::: h^n(Y,g)\\\\operatorname{vol}(Y,g)\\\\geq \\\\operatorname{deg}(f) h^n(X,g_0)\\\\operatorname{vol}(X,g_0), :: and for n ‚â• 3, the equality occurs if and only if (Y,g) is locally symmetric of the same type as (X,g0) and f is homotopic to a homothetic covering (Y,g) -> (X,g0). == Application in differential geometry of surfaces == Katok's entropy inequality was recently exploited to obtain a tight asymptotic bound for the systolic ratio of surfaces of large genus, see systoles of surfaces. == References == * Besson, G., Courtois, G., Gallot, S.

Most of its members launched the Movement for the Left (MpS) in late January 2009. Another part of its members decided not to leave the Party, \\"going on with the Refoudation process\\". ==History== RpS emerged as a faction within the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC) gathering the Bertinottiani, the group around Fausto Bertinotti, who controlled the majority of the party from 1998 to 2008. They supported the candidacy of Nichi Vendola for party secretary in the 24‚Äì27 July 2008 congress of the party. Vendola was defeated and Paolo Ferrero, a former bertinottiano who gained the support of the party's left- wing, became secretary. The faction was officially launched during a \\"national assembly\\" on 27 September 2008. Refoundation for the Left represented the modernisers within the party and supports the creation of a united left with greens, socialists and other radicals (in fact they were among the keenest supporters of The Left ‚Äì The Rainbow), both in Italy and in Europe.http://www.rifondazioneperlasinistra.it/?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=78 As Vendola explained in an interview, he will seek an alliance with the Democratic Party, excluding Antonio Di Pietro's Italy of Values, whose \\"justicialism\\" is an \\"illness\\". In January 2009 the new leadership of the party replaced the editor of Liberazione, the party's newspaper, removing Piero Sansonetti, close to Vendola. The decision was strongly opposed by Vendoliani. At the same time Ferrero ruled out any alliance for the European Parliament election, in which the party will run alone, provoking another rift with Vendoliani, who were keen supporters joint-list with other left-wing forces, and that was considered another step toward the break-up of the party. On 24 January the group around Vendola, including Franco Giordano, Gennaro Migliore and Alfonso Gianni, finally decided to leave the party and to transform their faction into a party, the Movement for the Left (MpS). However some members of the faction, including Giusto Catania, Milziade Caprili and Tommaso Sodano, decided not to leave the PRC and re-organized themselves into To the Left with Refoundation, while Bertinotti decided not to take any decision for now. The group that decided not to leave the Prc chose Rosa Rinaldi and Augusto Rocchi as national leaders. Soon after Rocchi, Rinaldi and their group took back the \\"Refoundation for the Left\\" title. In October 2010 Augusto Rocchi and Rosa Rinaldi (the two leaders of Rps) decided to resign and to leave the leadership of the faction to a third person, because of their full-time activity in the National Secretariate of Communist Refoundation Party. The assembly of Rps elected Stefano Zuccherini new leader. ==External links== *Official website *Former official website *Manifesto for the Refoundation ==References== Category:Communist Refoundation Party factions ","title":"Refoundation for the Left"},{"id":"19346725","text":"Greek-American Athletic Club was a semi-professional soccer club from San Francisco, California that played in the San Francisco Soccer Football League. They are the most successful team in Francisco Soccer Football League's history with 16 titles to their credit. In its 56 year history, Greek-American AC advanced to the US Open Cup Final three times, winning in 1985 and 1994. The club first reached the Open Cup Quarterfinals in 1963 and over the next three decades would finish with 12 Round of 8 appearances, which remains tied for the third-most in tournament's history. ==History== Early Years The team was founded in 1949 by brothers Jim and John Rally. Under the auspices of the Greek Orthodox Church of Annunciation, it was at that time entered in the Alliance(Reserve) Division of the SFSFL under the name 'Pan-Hellenes', for two disappointing seasons with a record of five wins and twenty three losses. Being an independent team, it was admitted to the league's Second Division for the 1950‚Äì51 season as the team came under the auspices of the Greek-American Youth Club, a social club to which most of the players belonged and was renamed Greek-Americans. Within two years, the Greek-Americans became the cinderella team of the year, winning the championship and promotion to the league's top division, the First Division. This feat was accomplished due to the superlative playing skills of Mike Nicolas, a then recent arrival from Cyprus, who trained the team prior to the start of the season and led the Greek-Americans to the championship by personally scoring 43 goals in 14 league games. The following season, however, the competition in the First Division proved to be too much for the inexperienced Greek-Americans, as the team finished last and was demoted down to the Second Division, where it was in contention for the next two seasons, finishing third and second on each occasion. In the 1957‚Äì58 season, they once again won the title in a dramatic play-off against the SSF Scots. The team's second attempt in the top division fared better than the first as the team finished seventh with twelve points, league rules requiring it to defend its First Division berth in a play-off game against challenger Club Peru from the Second Division. The speedy and technically superior Peruvians defeated the Greek-Americans who were once again obliged to return to the lower division. Promotion It was after this second failure to remain in the top division that the Directors of the club resolved to rebuild the team with new talent by recruiting and importing top players to its ranks. As a result of these efforts, John Davidson a world cup pick and Bob Hughes, two outstanding Scottish players were recruited from Canada, and along with Mike Nicolas were instrumental for the team's excellent showing in the 1959‚Äì60 season, winning eleven games while losing only one. Yet, at the end of the season, the team finished in a tie with the San Francisco Athletic Club. After many postponements, the highly favored Greek- Americans lost the play-off to their Italian adversaries and a second play-off to First Division seventh place finisher AAC Teutonia and were forced to remain in the Second Division, as it turned out for the last time, for with the addition of more players, like George Cruickshank, the team won its third Second Division championship in 1960‚Äì61 without suffering a single defeat. Decades of dominance Since that time the team has remained in the top division for over forty years, a period of longevity unequalled by any other team. The Greeks first challenged the supremacy of the Scots in the Open Cup, defeating them twice in three seasons; but they had to wait until 1966‚Äì67 to lift their first SFSFL title. After another breakthrough season, the Greeks went on to become the most dominant team in the history of the league, amassing a staggering 53 trophies. During one period between 1986 and 1989, the Greeks were undefeated in 55 consecutive games and won five straight league titles from 1984 to 1989. Under former U.S. national team coach Lothar Osiander the team won two U.S. Open Cups in 1985 and 1994. The 1997 fire Tragedy struck in 1997, when a massive fire broke out at an industrial laundromat managed by John Rally. The fire destroyed much of the memorabilia and trophies that the brothers had acquired through their many decades of patronage. All that was left was only the memories of glory. ==Milestones== *1949: Founded as San Francisco Pan-Hellenes *1949-1950: Started playing in \\"Alliance\\" division of SFSFL *1950: Club renamed to San Francisco Greek- Americans *1950-1952: Played in second division of SFSFL, gained promotion in 1952 *1952-53: That was its first season in first division, but relegated *1953-1958: Second division, gained promotion in 1958 *1958-59: First division, but relegated *1959-1961: Second division *1961-2005: First division, until the club was dissolved in 2005 *2015: Death of the founder and owner Jim Rally at the age of 85 ==Honors== San Francisco Soccer Football League *Champions (16): 1966‚Äì67, 1968‚Äì69, 1969‚Äì70, 1970‚Äì71, 1972‚Äì73, 1977‚Äì78, 1980‚Äì81, 1982‚Äì83, 1984‚Äì85, 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87, 1987‚Äì88, 1988‚Äì89, 1990‚Äì91, 1993‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95 *Second Division Champions (3): 1952‚Äì53, 1957‚Äì58, 1960‚Äì61 California State Cup (soccer) *Champions (5): 1965‚Äì66, 1968‚Äì69, 1979‚Äì80, 1982‚Äì83, 1985‚Äì86 *Junior Champions (1): 1968‚Äì69 U.S. Open Cup *Champions (2): 1994, 1985 *USASA National Cup OVER 30 Champions (2): 1996, 1998 Las Vegas Silver Mug *Tournament Champions (3): 1993, 1994, 1995 *Participations in CONCACAF Champions' Cup: 1989 ==U.S. Open Cup Finals== *1985: Greek-American A.C. - St. Louis Kutis SC 2-1 *1994: Greek-American A.C. - Bavarian Leinenkugel 3-0 (Van Reenen 56ŒÑ, Mike Dealray 61ŒÑ, 81ŒÑ) *1988: St. Louis Busch Seniors - Greek-American A.C. 1-1, aet 1-2 ==Notable players== *Andy Atuegbu *Godwin Odiye *Salvador Bernardez *Esmaeil Haj Rahimipour *John Doyle *Paul Bravo *Mark Semioli *Tim Martin ==External links== Category:Association football clubs established in 1949 Category:European-American culture in San Francisco Category:Greek-American culture in California Category:Soccer clubs in San Francisco Category:1949 establishments in California Category:Diaspora soccer clubs in the United States Category:U.S. clubs in CONCACAF Champions' Cup ","title":"Greek-American A.C."},{"id":"19346728","text":"Matthew Cox (born 6 March 1988) is an English rugby union for Worcester Warriors in the Aviva Premiership.

It was roughly the same size and weight as a Volkswagen Beetle, though flatter in shape. With its rounded, bony shell and squat limbs, it superficially resembled a turtle, and the much earlier dinosaurian ankylosaur ‚Äì providing an example of the convergent evolution of unrelated lineages into similar forms. In 2016 an analysis of Doedicurus mtDNA found it was, in fact, nested within the modern armadillos as the sister group of a clade consisting of Chlamyphorinae and Tolypeutinae. For this reason, glyptodonts and all armadillos but Dasypus were relocated to a new family, Chlamyphoridae, and glyptodonts were demoted from the former family Glyptodontidae to a subfamily. == Discovery == Although Darwin is said to have found the first fossils of glyptodontines (the subfamily), the first mention of the genus Glyptodon in Europe was in 1823, from the first edition of Cuvier's \\"Ossemens Fossiles\\". The then unnamed Glyptodon was briefly mentioned in a letter from D√°maso Antonio Larra√±aga. He had found \\"a femur... It was about seven pounds, and maybe six or eight inches wide\\", as well as part of a tail. At the time, the discovery was believed to have belonged to Megatherium, a type of giant ground sloth. A man named Sellow found some carapace plates in three-foot deep clay in Uruguay four years later. That discovery only made the professors even more certain that the discoveries were of Megatherium, since the bones of this prehistoric giant sloth were usually found in similar conditions and Cuvier had said that the genus was loricated. Some believed that the armor resembled that of the modern armadillo, but the popular opinion was the Megatherium theory. It was not until Professor E. D‚ÄôAlton wrote a memoir to the Berlin Academy in 1833 comparing the extreme similarities of these mysterious fossils to that of the armadillo, that the scientific world seriously considered that the pieces of carapaces and fragments of bone could belong to some prehistoric version of Dasypus. D‚ÄôAlton said that \\"all the peculiarities of the former [Dasypus] may be paralleled to the latter [fossil pieces]\\" He concluded that the fossils belonged to some prehistoric version of an armadillo. However, since a full skeleton was not available at the time, he said that his idea was not conclusive. This uncertainty in the fossil remains continued until a man named Dr. Lund identified the remains as a new genus in his 1837 memoir.  Naming of Glyptodon  Richard Owen's 1839 reconstruction of a Glyptodon skeleton; teeth at right When scholars first acknowledged the genus Glyptodon, there was not a consensus on its name. In 1837 Dr. Lund, a professor who wrote a memoir on Brazil's ancient fauna, suggested these creatures be recognized as the new genus \\"Hoplophorus\\". In 1838, another scientist, Professor Bronn, published in the second edition of his book Lethaea Geognostica a proposal for the new genus to be called \\"Chlamydotherium\\". In Professor D‚ÄôAlton's 1839 memoir, it was called \\"Pachypus\\". The director at the Museum of Natural History in Dijon at the time, M.L. Nodot, had named the genus \\"Schistopleuron\\". It was finally given a single name when English scholar Richard Owen noticed the similarities of the genera his colleagues were describing in their publications. Owen realized they were all the same genus from their depictions, from carapace to tooth structure. He decided on \\"Glyptodon\\", which means \\"grooved or carved tooth\\". The name was originally coined by Sir Woodbine Parish, the man who had sent some Glyptodon fossils to Europe. Those fragments of carapace and bones he sent had been heavily studied at the time and had assisted in the recognition of the new genus. After unifying the name of this genus, Owen continued working on its taxonomy. In 1845, after analyzing the fossils of his colleagues, he named four species within the genus: G. clavipes, G. reticulatus, G. ornatus, and G. tuberculatus. == Evolution == Glyptodon is part of the superorder of placental mammals known as Xenarthra. This clade of mammals also includes anteaters, tree sloths, armadillos, and extinct ground sloths and pampatheres. == Geography and habitat == Munich Glyptodon originated in South America. Their remains have been found in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. Of the Glyptodon species attributed to remains discovered in Brazil, G. clavipes had the largest range. Its distribution includes north, northeast, and southeast Brazil. G. reticulatus remains have only been found in southern Brazil. Due to poor morphological and taxonomic understanding, many of the species of the genus and their ranges have not been identified. Countries such as Bolivia, Paraguay and western Uruguay have been recently discovered to have accommodated Glyptodontidae. Material previously assigned to Glyptodon in northeast Brazil has been reassigned to Glyptotherium, restricting the distribution of Glyptodon to the southern region of Brazil. However, two osteoderms with characteristics similar to those of Glyptodon have been recently found in Sergipe state in the northeast, suggesting that both genera occurred in this region during the Pleistocene. The environments range from forested areas, sub-forested, to warm and humid, while some have become accustomed to open, cold areas where grasslands are the most common. The occurrence of the genus has also been observed in the southwestern part of the Amazon basin, which suggests that the wide diversity of the genus was due to the diverse climates within its range. During the Great American Interchange, a set of migrations that occurred after North and South America were connected by the rising of the volcanic Isthmus of Panama, Glyptodon migrated into Central America as far as Guatemala. A closely related genus, Glyptotherium, reached the southern region of the modern U.S. about 2.5 million years ago. == Feeding habits == Skull in side view Two main groups of glyptodonts can be distinguished by their feeding habits. Smaller-sized early Miocene propalaehoplophorids had narrow muzzles, while larger post-Miocene glyptodonts developed wider muzzles. The smaller glyptodonts were selective feeders, while the larger glyptodonts were bulk feeders. However, because of their body form and fusion of the cervical vertebrae, all members of Glyptodon would have needed to forage near the ground. Their craniomandibular joint limited their jaw to side-to-side movement. Teeth The feeding habits of Glyptodon, based on their jaw morphology, were herbivorous. Glyptodon had an \\"elaboration of the osteodentine ridges in their jaw that provided an effective grinding mill, causing the food particles to be pushed and sheared through constant motion of the mandible, allowing Glyptodon to consume their dietary needs.\\" They had a well-developed snout musculature, along with a mobile neck region that helped them secure food. Like most other xenarthrans, glyptodonts had lower energy requirements than most other mammals. They could survive with lower intake rates than other herbivores with similar mass. Glyptodon grazed near water sources such as rivers and lakes. Based on stable isotope analysis, it is evident that its diet consisted primarily of dicotyledonous trees and monocotyledonous grasses. == Behavior == Glyptodonts are believed to have taken part in intraspecific fighting. Zoologists presume that since the tail of Glyptodon was very flexible and had rings of bony plates, it was used as a weapon in fights. Although its tail could be used for defense against predators, evidence suggests that the tail of Glyptodon was primarily for attacks on its own kind. A G. reticulatus fossil displays damage done on the surface of its carapace. A group of zoologists calculated the amount of force required to break the carapace of Glyptodon. The calculation showed that Glyptodon tails would be able to break the carapace. Glyptodon likely fought each other to settle territorial or mating disputes, much like male-to-male fighting among deer using their antlers. == Anatomy == Artist's conception Glyptodon measured in length, in height and weighed up to .  Skull  The nasal passage was reduced with heavy muscle attachments for some unknown purpose. Some have speculated that the muscle attachments were for a proboscis, or trunk, much like that of a tapir or elephant. The lower jaws were very deep and helped support massive chewing muscles to help chew coarse fibrous plants. Teeth resembled those of an armadillo, but were fluted on each side by deep grooves. The anterior teeth were compressed, while the posterior teeth were cylindrical. A distinctive bar of bone projects downwards on the cheek, extending over the lower jaw, perhaps providing an anchor for powerful snout muscles. Another suggestion, made by A.E. Zurita and colleagues, is that the large nasal sinuses could be correlated with the cold arid climate of Pleistocene South America.  Osteoderms  Close-up view of carapace Before the Pleistocene, Glyptodon‚Äôs osteoderms were attached by syntoses and were found in double or triple rows on the front and sides of the carapace's edges, as well as in the tail armor and cephalic shield. The carapace's osteoderms were conical with a rounded point, while the ones on the tail were just conical. The sulci between these raised structures were deep and wide with parallel lines. In the early 2000s, the presence of osteoderms on Glyptodon‚Äôs face, hind legs, and underside was confirmed in several species. The fossils with these characteristics were from the Pleistocene. These small to medium- sized ossicles were actually embedded in the dermis and did not connect in a pattern. The appearance of this new trait coincides with the arrival of North American predators in South America as part of the Great American Interchange, after the two continents became connected about three million years ago. For this reason, some scientists hypothesize that the osteoderms developed as a defensive/offensive mechanism. This belief is furthered by the discovery of fractured dorsal armor, which implies that Glyptodon had been in physical conflict with other species.  Carapace  Glyptodon skeleton and shell in Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin Glyptodon carapace in Hungarian Natural History Museum It was covered by a protective shell composed of more than 1,000 2.5 cm-thick bony plates, called osteoderms or scutes. Each species of glyptodont had its own unique osteoderm pattern and shell type. With this protection, they were armored like turtles. Unlike most turtles, glyptodonts could not withdraw their heads, but instead had a bony cap on the top of their skull. Even the tail of Glyptodon had a ring of bones for protection. Such a massive shell needed considerable support, evidenced by features such as fused vertebrae, short but massive limbs, and a broad shoulder girdle.David Lambert and the Diagram Group. The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life. New York: Facts on File Publications, 1985. pp. 196.  Tail  Armor at end of tail Glyptodon clavipes had a tail covered in free bony rings of dermal structures that made for a strong, flexible, and mobile appendix. This enabled it to use the muscles along its tail to powerfully swing it. (The rings in other glyptodonts' tails were fused together, making the tail a single piece of rigid bone; an example of this is Doedicurus.) The accessory ring, or caudal ring 1 has a short double row of small scutes. The proximal row has several small pentagonal scutes; the distal row includes more large pentagonal scutes than the caudal row. The scutes on the proximal row have convex shape, and each scute supports a pair of hair follicles. Ring 2 is the first complete caudal ring and it is the largest ring. It is consisted by two complete rows of firmly sutured scutes. The distal/ending scutes are larger, and their free margins are rounded producing a fanlike shape. Ring 3, the second complete ring, is almost the same as ring 2 except the smaller size and some of the scutes at the ending row reach the proximal margin, crowding the proximal scutes and making the proximal row incomplete despite the same number of 20 scutes in both rows. Rings 4‚Äì10 have decreasing diameters and increasing maximum length at the back (from 4 to 10). The rings have double rows, and have decreasing number of scutes in each row from ring 4 to ring 10. Glyptodon may have used their tails in competition for resources and also as an ornament when competing for sexual partners.  Spine  Glyptodon had thirteen consecutive vertebrae. Four of the thirteen anterior vertebrae are so close together that they are barely discernible. The other vertebrae are connected by sutures, which become farther apart the closer they are to the posterior. Each centrum is a thin bony plate that curves in such a way that that forms a hollow cylinder. The cylinder in the vertebrae is much larger in diameter near the front rather than the hinder vertebrae. The foremost vertebra is as wide as the posterior part of the trivertebral bone; the following vertebrae narrow rapidly until the fourth vertebra, which is no more than three-fifths as wide as the first.  Eyesight  Rod monochromacy is a rare condition characterized by the absence of cone photoreceptor cells in the eyes of vertebrates. It results in colorblindness and low acuity vision in dim-light conditions and blindness in bright-light conditions. Xenarthrans most likely only used vision at night, during twilight, and while in burrows. However, the understory of South America's rainforests may have been dark enough during the day to facilitate limited vision for species that dwelled there. Extinct glyptodonts' tough carapace and large body size might have compensated for their inability to see approaching predators. == Predation == Humans hunting Glyptodon, by Heinrich Harder Glyptodon may have been preyed upon by animals such as the saber-toothed cats Smilodon and Homotherium, the giant short-faced bear Arctotherium, dire wolves and terror birds. The evidence for predation on glyptodonts by humans is very scarce, limited to a Pliocene skull (Glyptotherium) in North America and some latest Pleistocene-early Holocene specimens in South America, with signs of human consumption. == Extinction == Some evidence suggests that humans drove glyptodonts to extinction. Hunters may have used the shells of dead animals as shelters in inclement weather.Fidalgo, F., et al. (1986) \\"Investigaciones arqueol√≥gicas en el sitio 2 de Arroyo Seco (Pdo. de Tres Arroyos, prov. de Buenos Aires, Rep√∫blica Argentina)\\" In: Bryan, Alan (ed.)

(1998) \\"Gliptodontes y Cazadores-Recolectores de la Region Pampeana (Argentina)\\" (\\"Glyptodonts and Hunter-Gatherers in the Pampas Region (Argentina)\\") Latin American Antiquity 9(2): pp.111‚Äì134 in Spanish Evidence from the Campo Laborde and La Moderna archaeological sites in the Argentine Pampas suggests that Glyptodon's relative Doedicurus and another glyptodont survived until the Early Holocene, coexisting with humans for a minimum of 4,000 years. This overlap provides support for models showing the South American Pleistocene extinctions resulted from a combination of climatic change and anthropogenic causes. These sites have been interpreted as ones used for butchering of megafauna (Megatherium and Doedicurus); however, some of the chronology has been problematic and controversial, due to poor preservation of the collagen used for dating. == See also == * * ==References External links == * Category:Pleistocene xenarthrans Category:Prehistoric cingulates Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Pleistocene mammals of North America Category:Pleistocene Guatemala Category:Fossils of Guatemala Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Pleistocene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Pleistocene Brazil Category:Fossils of Brazil Category:Pleistocene Paraguay Category:Fossils of Paraguay Category:Pleistocene Peru Category:Fossils of Peru Category:Pleistocene Uruguay Category:Fossils of Uruguay Category:Pleistocene Venezuela Category:Fossils of Venezuela Category:Fossil taxa described in 1839 Category:Taxa named by Richard Owen ","title":"Glyptodon"},{"id":"19346764","text":"Bring on the Girls may refer to: * Bring On the Girls!, a story by P.

Numbers 651 to 663 Squadrons of the RAF were Air Observation Post units which had both Army and RAF personnel. The pilots, drivers and signallers were in the Royal Artillery whilst the adjutants, technical staff and equipment officers came from the RAF. Air observation posts were used primarily for artillery spotting, but occasionally for liaison and other duties. Their duties and squadron numbers were transferred to the Army with the formation of the Army Air Corps on 1 September 1957. ==History== No 651 Squadron was formed at RAF Old Sarum, Wiltshire, on 1 August 1941. It went into action in November of that year, during Operation Torch in North Africa. It later served in Italy, North Africa, and finally Egypt from 1945 where it remained until 1 November 1955. On that same day, No. 657 Squadron RAF was re-numbered to 651 Squadron at RAF Middle Wallop, it now flew Sycamore helicopters as well as Austers. No. 1908 Independent Air Observation Post Flight was formed within 651 Squadron previously 'A' Flight along with No. 1909 Air Observation Post Flight which was formed within 651 Squadron previously 'B' Flight. On 1 September 1957, the squadron was transferred to the Army Air Corps and became No. 651 Squadron AAC. On 2 April 2019, the Army transferred 651 Squadron's aircraft the Britten-Norman Defender and BN-2 Islander to the RAF as part of No. 1 Group.

The series follows the life of conjoined brothers of different species, with one half of the resultant animal being a cat and the other a dog. Nickelodeon produced the series from Burbank, California. The first episode aired on April 4, 1998, following the 1998 Kids' Choice Awards, before the show officially premiered in October of that year. Similarly, the Season 2 episode \\"Fetch\\" was shown in theaters with The Rugrats Movie in 1998 before airing on television. The series was ended on June 15, 2005, after a total of four seasons and 68 episodes over 7 years. It was produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio and Peter Hannan Productions, and was released on DVD in Region 1 by Shout! Factory. After the initial run concluded, Nicktoons continued to show re-runs of the cartoon until September 5, 2011. Two animation studios‚ÄîSaerom Animation through Watchview Studio and Rough Draft Studios through Rough Draft Korea‚Äîworked on the animation for the show. ==Premise== The series revolves around Cat and Dog, a conjoined twin of a cat and a dog, who share the same body with no tail or hind legs. Although they are best friends and brothers, they have very different personalities, similar to \\"The Odd Couple\\" and the original \\"Looney Tunes\\" shorts, mixed with elements of Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and fellow Nicktoon Ren and Stimpy. Cat is very cultured while Dog is very fun-loving. Dog enjoys chasing garbage trucks, cars, and exploring many things that Cat does not want to be involved with. Dog enjoys eating at fast-food restaurants (such as Taco Depot), whereas Cat does not. The series takes place in Nearburg, a town dominated by anthropomorphic animals and the occasional humanoid. ==EpisodesCharacters== Main left * CatDog (voiced by Jim Cummings and Tom Kenny) are a conjoined cat and dog sibling. Cat is the smarter and more cunning and Dog is the more happy-go-lucky and more naive. Cat often devises plans to trick Dog into getting what he wants, such as making Dog smarter in an attempt to have more in common with him, or having him win a dog sledding contest by training him in a very hard and militaristic manner, and usually, as a result of his greediness and selfishness, these schemes all blow up in his face. Dog is the source of clumsiness. As his name implies, he is a dog. He is extremely ambitious when Cat or any other character convinces him to take on a task, diving right into it with full force and energy. With his brains and constant ridiculing from the rest of the characters, Cat is the more defensive and short tempered of the two. Dog is the typical loyal dog and is easily convinced. He is quite gullible and will believe everything he is told. His attention span is very short and he is easily distracted by balls, garbage trucks, bones, food, and his overactive imagination. Because of his more simple nature, Dog usually is the one who gets the pair into trouble. Not paying attention to Cat's warnings, his actions almost always end up with some severe consequences. Despite this, in many of the episodes, it is shown that Dog is usually the one that is more popular and athletic of the two. Cat has a \\"crush\\" on Shriek. In one episode, Cat admits his love for Shriek and kisses her after Shriek kisses Dog and tells him she loves him (only to wind up getting pounded by the aggressive poodle). Cat desires fame and fortune and tends to go to excessive lengths in order to gain them. He is intelligent and enjoys reading, gardening, and listening to classical music. He is somewhat uptight and believes strongly in being polite and neat. He is a stickler for cleanliness and, like many cats, hates water. Dog is often distracted with chasing shadows and chasing after tennis balls, and loves eating garbage. Much to the neat-freakish Cat's dismay, Dog leaves a mess everywhere he goes. Despite his sophisticated personality, Cat also has a dark side. Whenever he snaps, he becomes a ruthless, psychopathic maniac of whom even the Greasers are scared, once they see what he is capable of doing (especially his stress- induced, superhuman strength, evident in one episode when he destroyed the Greasers' monster truck with a single punch). * Winslow Thelonious Oddfellow (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is a tailless blue mouse that lives in CatDog's house in the hole in the wall. Winslow speaks with a typical Brooklyn accent. Winslow is always full of wisecracks about anything and everything. He is very sneaky and underhanded with CatDog, especially with Cat. Winslow and Cat do not get along very well at all, because he is always getting Cat in trouble. However, it was eventually revealed that Winslow may be afraid of Cat, because Cat tried to eat him once. Dog, however, does not mind Winslow and is friendly with him. Deep down, he has a very big heart and loves CatDog and at some point acts as CatDog's conscience and guidance for living in society, but acts out against them. His catchphrase is \\"What are you? Nuts?\\". * The Greaser Dogs are a street gang of three tough dogs named Cliff, Shriek and Lube, who act no differently from school playground bullies, picking on anyone either weaker or different from them, usually with a \\"pounding\\". They pick on CatDog (mostly Cat) because of their freakish nature. Dog sometimes gets along with them because he is also a canine. They initiated him into the gang after he had proven his worth. The Greaser Dogs also have a fear of ticks, which renders them helpless in almost any situation. The name Greasers is a reference to the greaser subculture. ** Clifford Maurice \\"Cliff\\" Feltbottom (voiced by Tom Kenny): The leader of the Greasers. He wears a black jacket with a picture of a dead cat on the back of it. He is very short-tempered and speaks similarly to Winslow with a Brooklyn accent only not as high. He got a taste of his own medicine when Eddie was accidentally glued to his jacket, which turned them into \\"Squirrel Dog\\". Once this happened, Shriek and Lube kicked him out of the Greasers because now he was a \\"two-headed freak.\\" Cliff learned the pain of being an outcast and what CatDog go through. However, once he was free of Eddie, he returned to his old bullying ways and rejoined the Greasers. In the episode \\"Beware of Cliff\\", when he is trapped under a massive weight for several days, he made a solemn vow never to bully anyone (especially CatDog, despite Cat's suspicions) again should he escape this fate, though it did not last very long because he got trapped again under a falling tree and later wanted to pound them again. Later episodes reveal softer sides of Cliff, such as his love for ballet and cashmere. Two episodes say that he was not an only child; the only proof is a niece and a nephew. Despite being the leader of the Greasers, he got banned from the group once, and he got pounded by Shriek and Lube for attacking them in one episode (he was protecting Catdog from them because of a vow to never bully them again). ** Shriek DuBois (voiced by Maria Bamford): The only girl in the Greasers and possibly the smartest of the group. She is a tiny yellow poodle, with a squeaky voice with a slight raspy quality to it. Shriek has blonde, poofy hair and wears a green shirt with the letter \\"S\\" on it. Though she is as tough and loyal as the other two, she harbors a secret crush on Dog, who is unaware of this. Shriek will not hit Dog, but will only hit Cat. In the episode \\"Rich Shriek, Poor Shriek\\" it is revealed that she came from a rich family, but she despised the posh life, and so she left home and became a Greaser. Also, in the episode \\"Back to School\\" Shriek is shown to have a niece named Squeak, who greatly resembles her. ** Ignatius \\"Lube\\" Catfield-McDog (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui): A hound, he is the slowest and sweetest one of the group. He will forget what he has been saying and slur his speech. He is the most loyal of the three Greasers. Despite his dimwitted nature, Lube is musically talented and is fluent in Spanish. In one episode, he rolls up his right trouser and takes off a wooden leg. He also works part-time as a mechanic. His parents, a cat mother and a dog father, appeared in \\"CatDog and the Great Parent Mystery\\" and they said that Lube got separated from them a long time ago. Also, Lube is shown to have a sister, who tries to marry Cat. In another episode, his real name is revealed to be Ignatius, which Cliff makes fun of relentlessly. He also has a nephew which appeared in an episode where cat went back to school * Rancid Rabbit (voiced by Billy West) is a Californian rabbit and the stereotypical authority figure. He had his job titles like police officer, life guard, prison guard, firefighter, boss of various businesses, principal, president, mayor, Egyptian pharaoh, doctor, TV host, contest judge, store and Taco Depot manager, etc. In one episode, he appears as a principal at a school and, at the end, as a police officer. When Cat asks him about this, he never receives an answer. Rancid hates CatDog and will go out of his way to punish them or force them to work for him, abusing his power to the fullest degree. Rancid takes advantage of CatDog as much as he can by deceiving them into buying his products or pushing them to do his bidding in a job. He does whatever it takes to take their money or benefit himself in any way. Rancid owns a mall called the Mall of Malls, and has a selfish and spoiled niece named Rancine. Rancid also has a Russian-accented female cousin named Rotten who lives in Farburg. * Eddie the Squirrel (voiced by Dwight Schultz) is a Greaser wannabe with little red pieces of paper taped to the side of his head to look like red sideburns in hopes to be more like Cliff. He is always bruised up from getting punched, and from being used as a birdie in badminton, or a football. He wants to be an official Greaser very badly, but sadly lacks their number one requirement: being a dog. Recurring * Randolph Grant (voiced by Billy West) is a trendy, suave cat who has an accent like Cary Grant. He will try anything once, as long as it's terribly exciting and attention-getting. Randolph appears to be like a celebrity in his lifestyle. In \\"All About Cat,\\" Randolph was hosting the musical awards banquet. In \\"The Lady is a Shriek\\" Randolph is the proud owner of \\"Randolph's Charm School and House of Beauty\\", to help turn girls into beautiful women with poise and etiquette. Randolph is essentially a trend-setting, rich and famous cat. His catchphrase is \\"And I love it!\\" * Tallulah Headbank (voiced by Maria Bamford) is an actress on whom Cat has an enormous crush. CatDog first met Tallulah during the musical \\"Abe Lincoln Superstar\\". Since then, she has become a major celebrity and good friend of Randolph's. Tallulah is forever searching for her soul mate, who would be \\"as loyal as a dog and as clever as a cat, who will take [her] in his arms.\\" Her name is a parody of Tallulah Bankhead. * Mean Bob (voiced by Billy West), a fictional super-hero, is Dog's hero. Dog is an expert on Mean Bob, having watched his movies, played his video games and with his toys. * Lola Caricola (voiced by Nika Futterman) is a female Mexican Yellow-Bellied Whip-poor-will introduced in the third season. She is a zoologist, and CatDog's next-door neighbor. She gained a love of zoology while wrangling bulls on her family's ranch. Her catchphrase is \\"Unbelievable!\\" * The Ingrid Twins (voiced by Laraine Newman) are two female Swedish twin cat sisters whom Cat has a crush on. The light blue twin wears her hair in pigtails and wears a red leotard, while the gray twin wears her hair in a short bob and wears a blue leotard. In \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" one of the twins was Cat's pen pal. Cat tries to impress the twins so that they can go on a date with him, but they seem more interested in Dog. They also have an interest in dating TV stars and movie stars. * Mervis Pantry (a pig) and Dunglap Daniels (a weasel) (voiced by John Kassir) are CatDog's male best friends and are often used as background characters. They are rarely seen apart, and have been shown with various jobs, such as working at Taco Depot, the Kavity Krunch cereal factory, and Mervis even had a temporary run as a mailman trying to deliver CatDog's mail. Dunglap appears to be the luckier of the two due to his fortunes, like getting a promotion at a job, in contrast to Mervis's misfortunes, such as getting into an accident because of the Greasers. A running gag throughout the series is that Mervis and Dunglap can sometimes be seen fighting. They both have nerdy personalities and often feel uncomfortable and nervous around the \\"cooler\\" characters, especially the Greasers. * Mr. Cornelius Sunshine (voiced by Billy West) is a green-skinned, shirtless humanoid creature with a thin, once-coiled tail and no apparent emotions who has a monotone voice and demeanor very similar to the actor Ben Stein. His name is ironically the very opposite of his personality, and he often nods off and falls asleep in the middle of doing things, such as performing a (very unengaging) magic act. His sardonic and pessimistic personality may be Dog's fault, since Sunshine experiences stress of being hunted as a dustman by Dog since his early years in the job. Very little is known about him, and the ambiguity of his species is touched upon in \\"CatDog Catcher\\" when Rancid Rabbit starts arresting everyone for not having licenses: Dog does not have a dog license, Lola does not have a bird license, and so on; but when Rancid captures Sunshine, he says, \\"You're under arrest for not having a...not having a...not having a license!\\" Thus it is apparent that not even the characters in the series know what he is. Mr. Sunshine's first name is Cornelius. He was originally envisioned as a squirrel during the early planning stages. ==Production== The series, created by Peter Hannan, was developed as the next Nicktoons production and produced from Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California. Hannan served as executive producer. This was part of Nickelodeon's $350 million investment in original animation over the next five years after the series' inception. Albie Hecht, Nickelodeon's senior vice president of worldwide productions, said that the creators planned for the series to \\"really play off of kids' sympathies\\" by portraying the characters as experiencing \\"the worst of both worlds\\". Hannan said CatDog was inspired by watching neighborhood cats and dogs occasionally fight each other, and thought that it would be great to make conjoined twins Cat and Dog to see how both of the animals would fare against other things. The idea of them being conjoined twins came from Hannan watching several news stories on TV about conjoined twins living a normal life conjoined together. Both aspects he claimed, initially developed the idea of CatDog. The title characters were originally envisioned as a two-headed superhero called \\"CatDog Man.\\" ==Release== Broadcast The series originally aired on Nickelodeon in the US from 1998‚Äì2005.

The victim and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, were attacked by a number of teenage boys while walking through Stubbylee Park in Bacup, Rossendale, Lancashire, on 11 August 2007. As a result of the severe head injuries Lancaster sustained in the attack, she went into a coma from which she never regained consciousness and died of her injuries thirteen days later. The police said the attack may have been linked to the couple wearing gothic fashion and being members of the goth subculture. Five teenage boys were later arrested and charged with murder. Two of them were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The other three were convicted and jailed for grievous bodily harm. A memorial fund was established in Lancaster's name, and numerous events have paid tribute to her locally, nationally and internationally. Plays, films, art and books have covered the issues surrounding the murder. == Background == Sophie Lancaster (born 26 November 1986) was a former pupil at Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School and Haslingden High School, and a gap year student planning to attend Accrington and Rossendale College to do an English degree. She had been dating Robert Maltby, a 21-year-old art student from Manchester, for three years, and they both had a long-standing attachment to the goth subculture. The couple's family described them as \\"Goths\\", and said: \\"They're both intelligent, sensitive kids. They're not the sort of people to get in trouble, but they have had problems in the past because they stand out\\". == Attack == While returning home, Lancaster and Maltby were subjected to a \\"vicious mob attack\\" from \\"a large group of people\\" between 1:10 and 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, 11 August 2007, at the skate park area of Stubbylee Park, Bacup (). The couple were walking home and came across a gang of teenagers at the entrance to the park. The group followed them and assaulted Maltby, knocking him unconscious, and then Lancaster, who was shielding her boyfriend. A 15-year-old witness told police: \\"They were running over and just kicking her in the head and jumping up and down on her head\\". One witness used a mobile phone to call for emergency services saying: \\"We need... we need an ambulance at Bacup Park, this mosher has just been banged because he's a mosher\\". Witnesses said that afterwards, \\"The killers celebrated their attack on the goths ‚Äì or \\"moshers\\" ‚Äì by telling friends afterwards that they had \\"done summat [something] good,\\" and claiming: \\"There's two moshers nearly dead up Bacup park ‚Äì you wanna see them ‚Äì they're a right mess\\". Police said that it was \\"a sustained attack during the course of which the pair received serious head injuries and their faces were so swollen we could not ascertain which one was female and which one was male\\". Both were hospitalised as a result of the attack, initially at Rochdale Infirmary. Maltby's injuries left him in a coma and with internal bleeding. He gradually recovered, but had lost memory of the time leading up to, and during, the attack. Lancaster, in a deep coma, was placed on life support and moved to Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, then to the neurology unit at Hope Hospital (now Salford Royal Hospital) in Salford. The hospital staff determined that she would never regain consciousness, and on 24 August 2007 her life support was terminated. == Arrests and investigation == Lancashire Police arrested five individuals in connection with the attack, but conducted extensive further investigations, as it appeared that up to fifteen people were in the area and may have witnessed or participated in the assault. The police identified the gothic dress of the couple as a possible motivation for the attack. A 15-year-old and a 16-year-old were remanded in custody, while two 15-year-olds and a 17-year-old were released on bail. They were originally charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent, but following Lancaster's death the Crown Prosecution Service charged all five boys with her murder. By 5 October 2007, after questioning over 100 people, the police concluded that they were not expecting to make any more arrests in the case, and although 15‚Äì20 people were in the park at some point during the night of the attack, they believed that many were not directly involved, as the area was a regular night time hangout spot for teenagers. Local residents identified the park as a spot often used by, \\"drunken, violent yobs\\" guilty of vandalism and under-age drinking. They had asked for measures to be taken about the area before the tragedy occurred. Following the murder, residents called for improved security in the area, but Rossendale Borough Council said park rangers would be too expensive. ==Trial and aftermath== On 6 September 2007, the five suspects were charged with murder at Burnley Youth Court. Three were released on bail: two boys aged 15 and 17 from Shawforth, and a 17-year- old boy from Bacup. On 18 October at Burnley Youth Court, all five were summoned to appear at Preston Crown Court. A preliminary hearing was held on 31 October 2007, where all five were charged with the murder of Lancaster and grievous bodily harm with intent for the assault on Maltby. A further plea and case management hearing was ordered by Judge Anthony Russell QC for 14 December. The judge also indicated a provisional trial date, on both allegations, of 10 March 2008. At the hearing on 14 December 2007, the five accused pleaded not guilty on both charges. At the beginning of the trial on 10 March 2008, all five boys pleaded guilty to the charge of grievous bodily harm with intent, Ryan Herbert pleaded guilty to murder, Brendan Harris pleaded not guilty to murder, while the murder charges against the other three were dropped. As the trial opened the prosecution told the hearing: \\"Sophie and Robert were singled out not for anything they had said or done, but because they looked and dressed differently\\". The jury heard extensive descriptions of the severity of the attack from a number of witnesses and through a recorded phone conversation taken at the time. At the conclusion of the trial on 27 March 2008, Brendan Harris was found guilty of murder, and the judge allowed the names of both Harris and Herbert, which had been concealed during the trial, to be made public. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police said it was one of the most violent murders he had come across in his career: \\"I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was. They have just done it without thinking, but they seemed to have enjoyed it, and carried on remorselessly kicking at two very defenceless people who were unable to protect themselves because of the level of violence inflicted upon them... I am very critical of some of the parents involved. I really don't think they have taken completely seriously how repulsive this incident was...\\". He said that when Harris was initially interviewed about the assaults he was \\"laughing and joking\\" with his mother. Sentencing in the case was set for 28 April 2008. Both Harris and Herbert were sentenced to life imprisonment with the trial judge recommending that Harris should serve at least eighteen years and Herbert at least sixteen years and three months. In his closing remarks the judge described the attack as \\"feral thuggery\\" which raised questions about the \\"sort of society which exists in this country\\". He added: \\"This was a terrible case which has shocked and outraged all who have heard about it. At least wild animals, when they hunt in packs, have a legitimate reason for so doing, to obtain food. You have none and your behaviour on that night degrades humanity itself\\". The three other defendants were also sentenced for their role in the attack. Brothers Joseph and Danny Hulme, and Daniel Mallett, who had all earlier pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent on Maltby, were jailed. Mallett was sentenced to four years and four months, and the Hulme brothers for five years and ten months each. On 13 June 2008, it was reported that all the defendants were appealing against the sentences for their convictions. The appeal was heard on 7 October 2008 with an announcement that the result would be released at a later date. On 29 October the results of the appeal were announced. Ryan Herbert had his minimum term reduced from sixteen years and three months to fifteen years and six months, a reduction of nine months after the appeal judges ruled not enough allowance had been made for his guilty plea in the initial trial. Brendan Harris and the three other defendants had their appeals dismissed. ==Tributes to Lancaster== The park where the attack occurred was covered with floral tributes to the couple soon after the attack, and online message boards have seen many tributes to Lancaster from well-wishers, including some from Europe and America, including a special Facebook and a Bebo group in her honour. The attack was widely condemned in Lancashire and Rossendale by Council leaders and the local community. At the alternative electronic music festival Infest in Bradford on 26 August 2007, just after Lancaster's death, Ronan Harris of VNV Nation dedicated the song \\"Illusion\\" to her and contacted the family to offer his condolences. There has also been discussion of a plaque in her memory in the park. A song was dedicated to Lancaster in concerts at Bacup's Royal Court Theatre on 6/7 September 2007, and a collection taken. A twelve-hour-long concert in her honour was held on 6 October 2007, in the grounds of Bacup Borough F.C., featuring 10 bands. The club played a game during the concert with all the takings going to the memorial fund; this included a song written in Lancaster's honour. Lancaster's family and friends set up a website in her memory and have decided to use the contributions from wellwishers and these events to set up a special fund to be known as \\"S.O.P.H.I.E\\". Standing for \\"Stamp Out Prejudice Hatred and Intolerance Everywhere\\", it aims to \\"provide an appropriate memorial; a lasting legacy to raise awareness of the injustice perpetrated against Sophie Lancaster and to work towards a more tolerant, less violent society\\". Lancaster's mother said: \\"it will also help fund group sessions with young people to teach them about alternative cultures and to respect everyone\\". A special black ribbon was being sold to support the fund available at the many events being held across Rossendale and in local shops. Lancaster's memory was further honoured at the Eccentrik Festival in North Carolina, and it was said that \\"three more concerts are planned in California, one in Iowa and one in Brisbane, Australia\\". A number of gothic gigs and club nights across the UK and Ireland dedicated a night to Lancaster in October and November 2007, including the Whitby Gothic Weekend. A collection was raised from these events to place a memorial bench to her in Whitby. The bench was put in place on Whitby's West Cliff in January 2008. The \\"Sophie Award\\" has been established as an ongoing prize for innovative and experimental film-making at Bacup Film Festival. Lancaster's public funeral was organised for 12 November 2007, and attended by hundreds of people, including BBC film crews. On 25 November 2007, Lancaster's friends held a memorial concert to \\"commemorate Sophie's uniqueness\\", featuring her favourite local bands, the night before what would have been Lancaster's 21st birthday, at St Mary's Chambers, Rawtenstall; the concert was covered by Granada Television.http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/headlines/display.var.1860030.0.friends_memorial_for_sophies_21st_birthday.php A repeat event was planned for 26 November 2008, headlined by The Damned and AOR featuring Dave Sharp founder member of The Alarm. On 13 January 2009, it was announced that the Bloodstock Open Air festival were to rename their second stage to The Sophie Lancaster Stage in tribute, and to promote the S.O.P.H.I.E. Campaign. The second stage has carried the name each year since. On 24/25 June 2008, Carabas Theatre Company performed a new dark comedy that dealt with perceptions of the Gothic subculture, donating all profits to the S.O.P.H.I.E fund. The work was performed at the Gregson Centre, Moor Lane, Lancaster. In a discussion after the performance, the cast and audience discussed Goth culture, the issues raised in the performance, and the possibility of educating young people about different subcultures to foster unity and acceptance from a young age. The work, \\"Suckers\\", was written and directed by MJ Wesolowski, and the production raised money for the S.O.P.H.I.E fund. On 3 June 2010, Robert Maltby began an exhibition of his own art at Affleck's Palace in Manchester containing 15 paintings inspired by Lancaster. The exhibition was called Crimson Iris: The Art of Sophie. The money raised went to the Sophie Lancaster Foundation. The 2012 Delain album and single We Are the Others is dedicated to her memory. On 28 July 2012 Punk Poet Andy T (Andy Thurlow) released a song \\"Sophie Lancaster\\" on the \\"Life at Tether's End\\" LP; he normally performs this at live shows. On 14 June 2014, it was announced that Lancaster's mother Sylvia was to receive an OBE in recognition of her campaign to promote a more tolerant society. In 2017, the Goths for Sophie Calendar Project was created by Ren√©e Gee of Necromancy, launching a social media campaign to recognise the 10th anniversary of Sophie's passing, which included 12 ambassadors from around the world. The Australian-based project continued in 2018 and is held annually for the Sophie Lancaster Foundation. == Media reaction == The attack was discussed in the media in connection with a wave of youth gang-related violence in the UK over the summer of 2007, including the murder of Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones. Then Conservative leader David Cameron mentioned the attack as an example in a \\"speech criticising youth crime and Britain's 'real and growing' problem with violence\\". Since then, coverage has mainly been restricted to the local press and the Internet, except for the funeral, which received wider coverage. In February 2008, The Observer compared the limited amount of coverage the Lancaster case received to the large amount of coverage worldwide which the media paid to the case of discrimination faced by a Yorkshire goth couple who were thrown off a bus: \\"That the story received just a fraction of the coverage by the dog-lead goths tells you something about society. The British eccentric has become the circus freak.\\" However, the trial in March 2008 saw extensive coverage in national media. On 13 March 2008, Bizarre magazine launched a \\"Proud to be Different\\" campaign in honour of Lancaster. Rod Liddle of The Sunday Times noted after the murder that the victims of the attack had paid the price for the indulgence of the \\"feral\\" criminals who perpetrated it \\"by their parents, by the courts, by the council, by a government which wants to send fewer such people to prison.\\" There are a large number of Facebook groups dedicated to Lancaster. With the exception of the \\"Sophie Lancaster Foundation\\" group, none of these are official, and nearly all focus on the tragedy of her death. On 26 November 2009, which would have been Lancaster's 23rd birthday, a 4-minute animation named Dark Angel, based on the murder, was released onto the internet and shown on MTV. The film was also projected onto a screen in the Cathedral Gardens in Manchester. In July 2010, the book Weirdo Mosher Freak by journalist Catherine Smyth was published about the murder. On 11 March 2011, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the play Black Roses: The Killing of Sophie Lancaster,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00z62b1 consisting of poems by Simon Armitage telling the story of Lancaster's life, combined with the personal recollections of her mother. The role of Lancaster was played by Rachel Austin. On 11 October 2015, BBC Four broadcast Black Roses : The Killing of Sophie Lancaster, a 45-minute tribute.BBC Two ‚Äì Black Roses: The Killing of Sophie Lancaster Her story was told through a sequence of poems by Simon Armitage. Lancaster's mother ‚Äì Sylvia Lancaster ‚Äì was played by actress Julie Hesmondhalgh. She spoke the words of Sylvia Lancaster about the life and death of Sophie (who was played by Austin reprising her role) throughout the programme. On 18 June 2017, BBC Three released a film based on the events surrounding Lancaster's death, Murdered for Being Different. == Reaction in the goth and alternative community == The crime has received much discussion and expressions of sympathy, not just amongst the UK goth subculture, but in other subcultures, and overseas as well. Martin Coles, who organised the Whitby bench fund, said, \\"Since starting the online campaign to raise awareness of the collection I've been contacted by people from all over the world that have been shocked by this, and not just those from the gothic community, I've been talking to goths, bikers, metallers, people from the electro and indie scenes, just about any 'alternative' genre\\". Many discussions have focused on whether the attack should be described as an example of a hate crime and has been compared to the murder of the punk Brian Deneke in the United States. It has been widely perceived by goths as a more extreme example of the social intolerance, violence and abuse people can suffer as a result of their attachment to the goth subculture. The Observer said on 17 February 2008 that the case was one of a \\"rash of violent attacks targeting punk, goth and metal kids... Sophie Lancaster's case has become a rallying cry for those in the goth scene worried about this upsurge of violence\\". This discussion of the case led to an online petition to the Prime Minister \\"to Widen the definition of 'Hate Crime', to include crimes committed against a person or persons, on the basis of their appearance or subcultural interests\\" on the 10 Downing Street website. Ade Varney, creator of the petition, said that goths \\"get verbal assaults every day, and not just from young people. But now younger teenagers have the mentality of hardened criminals, and I definitely sense this violent aspect getting worse.... Sophie's death has made people think, and I have heard of teenagers, especially girls, modifying the way they dress when they walk through certain areas\\". This led to political developments: the Manchester Evening News reported that Rossendale MP Janet Anderson and Hyndburn MP Greg Pope \\"are set to request a debate in the Commons to call for the widening of the law to include such an attack under the definition of a hate crime as soon as possible\\". The paper reported that they would be \\"putting forward an early day motion calling on the government to give the matter 'urgent consideration'.\\" In May 2009, the Justice Minister, Jack Straw, said that while he could not change the law, he could amend the sentencing guidelines to require judges to treat an attack on a member of a subculture as an aggravating factor, similar to a racially motivated or homophobic assault, when sentencing perpetrators. In April 2013, the Greater Manchester Police announced they would officially begin to record offences committed against goths and other alternative groups as hate crimes, as they do with offences specifically aimed at someone's race, disability or sexual orientation. ==See also== * Death of Brian Deneke * Suicide of Nicola Ann Raphael == References  External links == *The Sophie Lancaster Foundation.

The 83.10 was intended for duties on branch lines where a top speed of 60 km/h and a driving wheel diameter of 1,250 mm was sufficient. The carrying wheels and first coupled wheels worked together in a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The design of the Class 83.10 was based on the DR Class 65.10. The engines were fitted with superheated steam regulators, mixer-preheaters, distributed sandboxes and plate frames. They could haul a train load of up to 1,000 tonnes at 60 km/h on the level. After the delivery of the first locomotive in 1955 the engine was fully tested at the VES-M Halle trials depot. The various tests showed numerous shortcomings, that could not all be resolved on the production models. Several problems were able to be rectified in the course of subsequent modifications. The locomotive was never really convincing and, in the light of the looming changeover to diesel operations, only 27 examples were eventually built. It remains therefore relatively unknown. One area of operations was the Arnstadt‚ÄìSaalfeld line. In 1972 the last two machines, numbers 83 1025 and 83 1027 were retired.

The off-season saw the club sign a number of players, including Middlesbrough's highly rated young midfielder Lee Cattermole, Birmingham City pair Dani√´l de Ridder and Olivier Kapo, both of whom played under Bruce at Birmingham, and little known Egyptian striker Amr Zaki, ranked as the world's best striker in FIFA rankings. The club saw no forced sales during the transfer window, with players like Emile Heskey, Paul Scharner, Luis Antonio Valencia and Wilson Palacios deciding to commit their futures to the club rather than move away. The club did, however, allow Julius Aghahowa, Salomon Olemb√©, Josip Skoko, Andreas Granqvist, Marlon King and Marcus Bent to leave the club. During the pre-season the Latics played in seven friendlies, all away from home, to prepare for the upcoming Premier League season. The first match was on 19 July away to FC St. Veit, which Wigan won comfortably 3‚Äì0. The next game was played on 22 July against Bundesliga opposition Eintracht Frankfurt; the Latics were defeated 2‚Äì0. A further away game in Germany was played on 25 July against another Bundesliga club, Hannover, which finished 2‚Äì2. Wigan's first friendly on English soil was on 29 July at Barnsley, which saw the Latics give a debut to Lee Cattermole. The Wigan club thrashed the Yorkshire outfit 6‚Äì0 with goals from Marlon King, Emile Heskey, Luis Antonio Valencia, Michael Brown and a brace for new boy Dani√´l de Ridder. Wigan made the short trip to Sheffield on 2 August to play Championship club Sheffield Wednesday, defeating them 3‚Äì2. Wigan later travelled to Scotland to face Scottish Premier League team Hibernian on 5 August, winning 1‚Äì0 before finishing off their pre-season with an impressive 1‚Äì0 victory over Dutch side Utrecht. Wigan's first Premiership game was away to West Ham United on 16 August, with the home side victorious thanks to a Dean Ashton brace. Wigan finished the game the better side, according to reports, and had the better possession and territory overall for the whole game but could only muster one goal, from debutant Amr Zaki, losing 2‚Äì1. On 24 August Wigan played their first game at the JJB Stadium, against last season's Premier League runners-up Chelsea. The game began badly for Wigan who, already without first-choice goalkeeper Chris Kirkland, gave away a free kick after just 4 minutes of play just outside the box, which was scored by Deco. Despite going down early the Latics rallied and performed valiantly against one of the superior Premier League sides and pressed for an equalising goal, which, in the end, was in vain as Chelsea ran out 1‚Äì0 victors. On 26 August Wigan played against Notts County at the JJB Stadium in the second round of the League Cup, which led to a comprehensive 4‚Äì0 victory for the hosts. Many of Wigan's fringe players, including striker Henri Camara, shone in this one-sided affair with goals coming from Camara (2), Zaki and Tomasz Kupisz. On 30 August Wigan played away to Premiership newcomers Hull City in a Premier League game that, if Hull won, would take them to the top of the table. Wigan, however, were not to be thwarted three times in a row and thrashed Hull 5‚Äì0, the club's biggest victory in the Premiership. Hull began woefully with poor defending leading to an own goal by Sam Ricketts from a Kevin Kilbane corner within 5 minutes. Antonio Valencia added a second on the counterattack and, despite some decent resolve from Hull, they were finished after an Amr Zaki strike just after the hour mark made sure of the result. Later goals were added by Zaki and Emile Heskey. September Wigan's next home fixture was played against Sunderland on 13 September; the fixture which had caused controversy within the town due to the decision to move a Rugby League fixture the previous day by owner Dave Whelan to allow the pitch to be in good condition for the game against Sunderland, a move which angered many Wigan Warriors fans. The game itself started well for Sunderland, who dominated the game and eventually opened the scoring when Wigan defender Titus Bramble tried to clear the resulting corner and headed into his own goal. Wigan finished the half the better side and came out after half-time much the same but struggled to find the equaliser. The game became a more even affair nearer the end of the second half, with both side posting good chances. It was Wigan who would break Sunderland's resistance, however, with another goal from Amr Zaki equalising matters for Wigan before Lee Cattermole was given a red card in the final minutes of the game. On 16 September, Wigan announced the signing for former Birmingham and Ghanaian international goalkeeper Richard Kingson, released by the Midlands club at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, on a three-year contract after a successful trial period. On 21 September Wigan travelled to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur. The last time Wigan faced Tottenham they were heavily defeated 4‚Äì0, but performed much better against a struggling Tottenham side who, before the game, were rooted to the bottom of the Premiership. Wigan had a few decent chances but struggled to dominate the game for large periods, with only Tottenham's toothless attacking plays keeping Wigan in the game. Spurs had a claim for a penalty after Maynor Figueroa tripped Spurs midfielder Aaron Lennon in the box, but referee Steve Tanner dismissed their calls for a spot-kick. On 28 September Wigan faced Manchester City at the JJB Stadium. A long-range Antonio Valencia goal and an Amr Zaki penalty gave Wigan a 2‚Äì1 win; City's consolation goal was scored by Vincent Kompany. October On 4 October Wigan again played at home, against a struggling Middlesbrough side who had not won away from home all season. Wigan had looked confident and the most threatening during the opening half but were unable to take their chances when given them and were eventually undone in the 89th minute with a strike from Middlesbrough forward J√©r√©mie Aliadi√®re. On 18 October, Wigan travelled to Anfield to play league leaders Liverpool. Wigan showed sheer determination throughout the whole game and took the lead on the 29th minute from the head of lead goalscorer Amr Zaki. Dirk Kuyt later levelled things for Liverpool before a sensational strike from Zaki moments before half time gave Wigan the lead for the second time in the game. Wigan dominated the majority of the second half before a reckless challenge from Antonio Valencia led to him being given a second yellow card and leaving the field. The game opened up more for Liverpool who were inspired by Wigan's disadvantage and Albert Riera restored parity five minutes after the dismissal of Valencia. Wigan then had to play defensively for the remainder of the game as Liverpool assaulted the Wigan goal and were successful just five minutes before the end of the game as Dirk Kuyt nodded home a Jermaine Pennant cross to win the game for Liverpool. On 26 October, Wigan hosted an in-form Aston Villa side who comfortably beat Wigan 4‚Äì0. Gareth Barry had opened the scoring early in the first half after Titus Bramble gave away a penalty and were battered into submission in the second half with goals from Gabriel Agbonlahor and John Carew within five minutes of each other ending the game as a contest, a final goal from Steve Sidwell moments before the end compounding the misery for Wigan. On 29 October, Wigan travelled to Fulham. The game finished with another loss for Wigan, their fourth in a row. Both sides had been struggling for form before the game and it was billed as a relegation battle in which Fulham came out successful with a 2‚Äì0 victory. Andrew Johnson celebrated his 100th career goal in this game with an early goal and then another on the hour mark to finish off Wigan's resilence and put pressure on Wigan boss Steve Bruce. November On 1 November, Wigan's luck changed as they managed to take all three points in a hard-fought victory at Fratton Park against Portsmouth. Portsmouth controlled the opening half but a foul on Titus Bramble by Papa Bouba Diop led to a penalty, converted by Amr Zaki on the stroke of half time. Portsmouth came out in the second half strong and bombarded the Wigan goal, hitting the woodwork a total of four times before Wigan made Portsmouth pay for their wasteful demeanour with Emile Heskey bagging his 100th career goal to give Wigan a precious three points in the final minutes of the game. On 8 November, Wigan hosted Stoke City at the JJB Stadium. Wigan dominated the game but both sides were largely uninspiring in the first half with very few chances to be had. Wigan were better equipped in the second half and peppered the Stoke goal but were left frustrated at Stoke's defensive prowess; the game ended 0‚Äì0. On 11 November, Wigan travelled to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal in the fourth round of the League Cup. Although both sides largely players their reserve players, it was Arsenal who were victorious in a very one-sided affair. The game took a while to come to life, but a goal by Jay Simpson just before half-time broke the deadlock and spurred Arsenal onto an emphatic win against a toothless Wigan side. A further goal for Simpson and a goal from Carlos Vela ended Wigan's run in the League Cup. On 15 November, Wigan travelled to St James' Park to face Newcastle United. The first half was well controlled and organised by Wigan against a sloppy Newcastle, who conceded within three minutes after a wonder strike from Ryan Taylor. In the second half Newcastle looked more determined and were galvanised by a second bookable offence for Wigan's Emmerson Boyce. Wigan still looked in control of the game for large periods despite missing key men such as Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki, but were undone with the arrival of Michael Owen. It was Owen's attacking threat that eventually broke through and pulled Newcastle level on the 80th minute; seven minutes later, Owen's striker partner Obafemi Martins scored to put Newcastle in a seemingly unassailable position with minutes remaining. However, poor defending from Newcastle allowed Titus Bramble to power a header home with a minute of normal time remaining to earn Wigan a point. On 24 November, Wigan played a home fixture against Everton. In a game that offered many opportunities for both sides but woeful finishing it would be Wigan who would eventually break the deadlock with a strike from Henri Camara midway through the second half ensuring Wigan took all three points and clawed themselves out of the relegation zone. It was Camara's first Premier League goal since December 2006. Wigan finished the month by hosting fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion on 29 November. In a game that West Brom had fought hard in they initially took the lead through Ishmael Miller after a Titus Bramble blunder gifted the striker an opportunity on goal. West Brom could have had a further lead if not for the form of Chris Kirkland, who made numerous saves to keep Wigan in the game. Wigan would equalise through Henri Camara just after the hour mark and an 87th-minute goal from an unmarked Emmerson Boyce finished off an unlucky West Brom and gave Wigan a vital three points. December On 6 December, Wigan returned to the Emirates Stadium to face an out-of-form Arsenal. It was to be Arsenal's day, however, as Emmanuel Adebayor scored against the run of play in the 16th minute to give Arsenal a lead they would never lose and strike a blow to Wigan's confidence, despite a strong attacking threat in the final minutes from Wigan. On 13 December, Wigan hosted a Blackburn Rovers side in very poor form and eased to a 3‚Äì0 victory over their north-west rivals. Two early goals within two minutes of each other from Heskey and Valencia finished the game as a contest after 20 minutes with Lee Cattermole eventually ending the game with a third goal for Wigan midway through the second half. On 26 December, Wigan were again at home, this time against Newcastle United. Newcastle, despite good form coming into the game, were out of sorts and were behind on the scoreboard after 29 minutes with a superb 30-yard free kick from Ryan Taylor beating Shay Given. The second half had Newcastle offering little more than in the first half and things got worse for the north-east outfit when S√©bastien Bassong upended Amr Zaki in the penalty area and was given a red card with the penalty being converted by Zaki moments later. Newcastle did get a penalty of their own after a Chris Kirkland took Andy Carroll out in the penalty box and Danny Guthrie added a consolation goal at the end of a lacklustre performance. On 28 December, Wigan travelled the short distance to the Reebok Stadium to face Bolton Wanderers. Due to the significance of the game, being both a derby and a potential six-point fixture, tempers were heated and a lot of heavy tackles were used with several yellow cards being shown. Wigan did get the opening goal from the penalty spot after Andy O'Brien fouled Amr Zaki just before half time. Bolton then pressed for an equaliser and had the ball cleared off the line at one point during the game but could not find an equaliser and Wigan went home with all three points. January Wigan's first game of the new year came on 2 January in an FA Cup third round clash at Tottenham Hotspur. Wigan played a much weaker side than they had been playing in the Premiership up to now and it showed with Spurs dominating the game and running out comfortable 3‚Äì1 winners. Roman Pavlyuchenko opened the scoring for Spurs just inside the second half from the penalty spot after Wigan goalkeeper Richard Kingson fouled Fraizer Campbell. A long range shot from Jamie O'Hara bounced back off the woodwork at straight to Luka Modriƒá, who doubled Spurs' advantage midway through the second half. Wigan did fight back and earned themselves a goal through Henri Camara two minutes from time, but as they pressed forward for an equaliser they were caught on the counter by Pavlyuchenko, who added a third in stoppage time to knock Wigan out of the cup at the first hurdle. On 11 January Wigan had a return match in the Premier League against Tottenham, at the JJB Stadium. Wigan dominated the game for almost the full 90 minutes and were comfortable with Spurs' attacking strategies. Their hard work and endeavour paid off when Maynor Figueroa popped up with a header in the final minute to give Wigan a well-deserved 1‚Äì0 victory. On 12 January, Wigan announced a successful work permit application to allow Colombian international Hugo Rodallega to join Wigan from Mexican side Club Necaxa. On 14 January, Wigan travelled to Old Trafford to face reigning champions Manchester United in a rescheduled game. Wigan were caught cold in the opening minute of the game when Cristiano Ronaldo broke away down the right flank and crossed for Wayne Rooney to score. Despite heavy pressure from Manchester United in the first half, Wigan's defence remained strong and the second half saw Wigan dominate the champions and have a penalty claim harshly denied by referee Steve Bennett, but Wigan could not take their opportunities and United held on to claim victory. Wigan had also announced that they had rejected a bid for midfielder Wilson Palacios from Tottenham Hotspur worth ¬£10,000,000 and have asked Spurs to increase their offer. Tottenham returned with an improved offer of ¬£14,000,000 which was accepted by the Wigan club. The deal, however, was held up after a disagreement over the payment of transfer fees, allowing Manchester City to voice interest.Wigan: Tottenham have competition to sign Palacios On 15 January, it was announced that left-sided midfielder Kevin Kilbane had left Wigan to join Hull City for an undisclosed fee after Hull's long publicised interest in the Iris international. On 17 January, Wigan travelled to the City of Manchester Stadium to face Manchester City. City were the more controlled side during the first half but wasted their opportunities on goal. Wigan came out more spirited in the second period but conceded an early second-half goal to Pablo Zabaleta. City's good position was rocked only a few minutes later after the dismissal of Richard Dunne for a kick on grounded Wigan striker Amr Zaki. Wigan began to dominate proceedings from this point but could not find the finishing touch and even had Zaki miss an open goal five minutes before time and had a penalty decision ruled against them as City held on for victory to inflict back-to-back defeats on Wigan for the first time since October. On 21 January, Wigan and Tottenham agreed terms on the transfer of Wilson Palacios for ¬£12,000,000. On 22 January, Wigan announced the loan signing of Egyptian striker Mido from Middlesbrough on loan for six months, with Wigan's Marlon King moving in the opposite direction.Wigan's King makes Boro loan move On 23 January, Emile Heskey agreed terms and signed for Aston Villa in a deal worth ¬£3,500,000. On 28 January, Wigan hosted Premiership challengers Liverpool at the JJB Stadium. Liverpool began the game strongly and were awarded with a goal on the stroke of half-time by Yossi Benayoun. Wigan performed valiantly throughout the second half and controlled the midfield better than Liverpool and were awarded a penalty six minutes from the end of the game, which was converted by Mido on his debut for Wigan. Hugo Rodallega had a superb chance to win the game later on for Wigan, crashing a free kick against the bar but the game ended level. On 31 January, Wigan travelled to Villa Park to face Aston Villa. In a game dominated by Aston Villa Wigan's strong defence held the onslaught from Villa out for the whole gameFine display earns great result at Villa Park February On 2 February, it was announced that Henri Camara would join Stoke City on loan until the end of the season.Camara Clicks Shut ==First team squad== Out on loan ==Transfers== In {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left\\" !Player !From !Fee !Date !Notes ----  Dani√´l de Ridder  Birmingham City  Free  4 July 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Olivier Kapo  Birmingham City  ¬£3,500,000  16 July 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Lee Cattermole  Middlesbrough  ¬£3,500,000  29 July 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Richard Kingson  Unattached  Free  16 September 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Maynor Figueroa  Olimpia  Undisclosed  23 December 2008  align=\\"center\\"http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~1498116,00.html ----  Hugo Rodallega  Necaxa  ¬£4,500,000  26 January 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Ben Watson  Crystal Palace  ¬£2,000,000  26 January 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Charles N'Zogbia  Newcastle United  Swap  2 February 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Cho Won-Hee  Unattached  Free  12 March 2009  align=\\"center\\"http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~1588524,00.html } Out {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left\\" !Player !To !Fee !Date !Notes ----  Andreas Granqvist  FC Groningen  ¬£600,000  9 July 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  David Cotterill  Sheffield United  Undisclosed  31 July 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Carlo Nash  Everton  Undisclosed  1 September 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Luke Ashworth  Leyton Orient  Free  14 January 2009  align=\\"center\\"http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~1518821,00.html ----  Kevin Kilbane  Hull City  Undisclosed  15 January 2009  align=\\"center\\"http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~1519778,00.html ----  Wilson Palacios  Tottenham Hotspur  ¬£12,000,000  21 January 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Emile Heskey  Aston Villa  ¬£3,500,000  23 January 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Ryan Taylor  Newcastle United  Swap  2 February 2009  align=\\"center\\" } Loans in {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left\\" !Player !From !Start Date !End Date !Notes ----  Amr Zaki  Zamalek  22 July 2008  End of season  align=\\"center\\" ----  Maynor Figueroa  Olimpia  29 July 2008  23 December 2008  align=\\"center\\" ----  Mido  Middlesbrough  23 January 2009  End of season  align=\\"center\\"http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~1530572,00.html } Loans out {  style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:95%; text-align:left\\" !Player !To !Start Date !End Date !Notes ----  Marlon King  Hull City  14 August 2008  January 2009  align=\\"center\\" ----  Luke Ashworth  Leyton Orient  22 August 2008  3 November 2008  align=\\"center\\"http://origin- www.leytonorient.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10439~1372719,00.html ----  Rachid Bouaouzan  N.E.C.

It was 85 miles (136 km) from Grand Central Terminal and travel time to Grand Central was approximately two hours, sixteen minutes. The station consisted of a single low-level platform, on the west side of the single track line. Amenia is the only station on the Harlem Line named for one of the senses as opposed to a name derived from a person or object. Amenia means \\"pleasant\\", or pleasing to the eye. ==History== The New York and Harlem Railroad built their main line through Amenia between 1848 and 1852. When the station was built, it contained a freight platform, a telegraph office, Railway Express Agency office, and various spurs used for loading and unloading horse wagons in the 19th century, and later trucks in the 20th century. Amenia held an annual field day in 1913 and 1914, where Harlem trains brought hundreds of passengers up from Grand Central Terminal. The field day was held at the fairgrounds on North Road Amenia, which played host to many early industries in upper Dutchess County. Early businesses and industries in the town included a tannery, steelworks, a dairy and milk plant and three important iron mines, all of which utilized the railroad as a means of shipping and receiving goods. All business was located in close proximity to the tracks, making the Harlem Line the common carrier for each. Several large hotels were constructed in town, most notably, the Barton House and the Amenia Inn. New York Central Railroad merged with Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central Railroad in 1968. Passenger service was eliminated by Penn Central in 1972, and freight service was eliminated by their successor Conrail in 1980. Today, the railroad line was converted into the Harlem Valley Rail Trail. ==References== Category:Former New York Central Railroad stations Category:Railway stations in Dutchess County, New York Category:Defunct railway stations in New York (state) Category:Railway stations closed in 1972 Category:1972 disestablishments in New York (state) ","title":"Amenia station (New York Central Railroad)"},{"id":"19346930","text":"Richard A. \\"Rick\\" Geist (November 21, 1944 ‚Äì August 29, 2019) was an American politician who served as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 79th District, first elected in 1978. ==Career== Prior to his election to the House, Geist worked as a senior manager with EADS, a civil engineering firm, in Altoona.

They are closely related to, but a distinct branch off from, Mennonite churches. The Amish are known for simple living, plain dress, Christian pacifism, and are slower to adopt many conveniences of modern technology, with a view to not interrupting family time, nor replacing face-to-face conversations whenever possible. The history of the Amish church began with a schism in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and Alsatian Mennonite Anabaptists in 1693 led by Jakob Ammann. Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish. In the second half of the 19th century, the Amish divided into Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites. The latter do not eschew motor cars, whereas the Old Order Amish retained much of their traditional culture. When people refer to the Amish today, they normally refer to the Old Order Amish. In the early 18th century, many Amish and Mennonites immigrated to Pennsylvania for a variety of reasons. Today, the Old Order Amish, the New Order Amish, and the Old Beachy Amish as well as Old Order Mennonites continue to speak Pennsylvania German, also known as \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\", although two different Alemannic dialects are used by Old Order Amish in Adams and Allen counties in Indiana. , over 165,000 Old Order Amish lived in the United States and about 1,500 lived in Canada. A 2008 study suggested their numbers had increased to 227,000, and in 2010, a study suggested their population had grown by 10 percent in the past two years to 249,000, with increasing movement to the West. Most of the Amish continue to have six or seven children, while benefiting from the major decrease in infant and maternal mortality in the 20th century. Between 1992 and 2017, the Amish population increased by 149 percent, while the U.S. population increased by 23 percent. Amish church membership begins with baptism, usually between the ages of 16 and 23. It is a requirement for marriage within the Amish church. Once a person is baptized within the church, he or she may marry only within the faith. Church districts have between 20 and 40 families and worship services are held every other Sunday in a member's home. The district is led by a bishop and several ministers and deacons. The rules of the church, the Ordnung, must be observed by every member and cover many aspects of day-to-day living, including prohibitions or limitations on the use of power-line electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as regulations on clothing. Most Amish do not buy commercial insurance or participate in Social Security. As present-day Anabaptists, Amish church members practice nonresistance and will not perform any type of military service. The Amish value rural life, manual labor, and humility, all under the auspices of living what they interpret to be God's word. Members who do not conform to these community expectations and who cannot be convinced to repent are excommunicated. In addition to excommunication, members may be shunned,American Experience: The Amish a practice that limits social contacts to shame the wayward member into returning to the church. Almost 90 percent of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the church. During an adolescent period of rumspringa (dialectal [Pennsylvania] German for \\"springing around\\", \\"hopping around\\") in some communities, nonconforming behavior that would result in the shunning of an adult who had made the permanent commitment of baptism, may be met with a degree of forbearance. Amish church groups seek to maintain a degree of separation from the non-Amish world. Non-Amish people are generally referred to as \\"English\\". Generally, a heavy emphasis is placed on church and family relationships. The Amish typically operate their own one-room schools and discontinue formal education after grade eight, at age 13 or 14. Until the children turn 16, they have vocational training under the tutelage of their parents, community, and the school teacher. Higher education is generally discouraged, as it can lead to social segregation and the unraveling of the community. However, some Amish women have used higher education to obtain a nursing certificate so that they may provide midwifery services to the community.Graybill, Beth E. \\"Amish women, business sense: Old order women entrepreneurs in the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, tourist marketplace.\\" PhD diss., 2008. ==History== Anabaptist beginnings Cover of The Amish and the Mennonites, 1938 An old Amish cemetery in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, 1941 The Anabaptist movement, from which the Amish later emerged, started in circles around Huldrych Zwingli (1484‚Äì1531) who led the early Reformation in Switzerland. In Z√ºrich on January 21, 1525, Conrad Grebel and George Blaurock practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others.Anthony L. Chute, Nathan A. Finn, Michael A. G. Haykin. The Baptist Story, Nashville, 2015, p. 12. This Swiss movement, part of the Radical Reformation, later became known as Swiss Brethren.C. Arnold Snyder. Anabaptist History and Theology: An Introduction. Kitchener, Ontario, 1995, p. 62.  Emergence of the Amish  The term Amish was first used as a (a term of disgrace) in 1710 by opponents of Jakob Amman. The first informal division between Swiss Brethren was recorded in the 17th century between s (those living in the hills) and (those living in the Emmental valley). The s were a more extreme congregation; their zeal pushed them into more remote areas and their solitude made them more zealous. Swiss Anabaptism developed, from this point, in two parallel streams, most clearly marked by disagreement over the preferred treatment of \\"fallen\\" believers. The Emmentalers (sometimes referred to as Reistians, after bishop Hans Reist, a leader among the Emmentalers) argued that fallen believers should only be withheld from communion, and not regular meals. The Amish argued that those who had been banned should be avoided even in common meals. The Reistian side eventually formed the basis of the Swiss Mennonite Conference. Because of this common heritage, Amish and Mennonites from southern Germany and Switzerland retain many similarities. Those who leave the Amish fold tend to join various congregations of Conservative Mennonites.  Migration to North America  Amish began migrating to Pennsylvania, then regarded favorably due to the lack of religious persecution and attractive land offers, in the early 18th Century as part of a larger migration from the Palatinate and neighboring areas. Between 1717 and 1750 approximately 500 Amish migrated to North America, mainly to the region that became Berks County, Pennsylvania, but later moved, motivated by land issues and by security concerns tied to the French and Indian War. Many eventually settled in Lancaster County. A second wave of around 1,500 arrived in the mid 19th Century and settled in Ohio, Illinois, Iowa and southern Ontario. 1850‚Äì1878 Division into Old Orders and Amish Mennonites Most Amish communities that were established in North America did not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a \\"sorting out\\" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best. In the years after 1850, tensions rose within individual Amish congregations and between different Amish congregations. Between 1862 and 1878, yearly (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the tensions caused by the pressures of modern society. The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church. By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to boycott the conferences. The more progressive members, comprising roughly two- thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the Mennonite Church, and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish. The Egli Amish had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to \\"Defenseless Mennonite\\" in 1908. Congregations who took no side in the division after 1862 formed the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference in 1910, but dropped the word \\"Amish\\" from their name in 1957.Stephen Scott. An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups. Intercourse, Penn.: 1996, pp. 122‚Äì23. Because no division occurred in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the Mennonites. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the Ixheim Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in Alsace, are descended directly from former Amish congregations.  20th century  Though splits happened among the Old Order in the 19th century in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, a major split among the Old Orders took until World War I. At that time, two very conservative affiliations emerged ‚Äì the Swartzentruber Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, and the Buchanan Amish in Iowa. The Buchanan Amish soon were joined by like-minded congregations all over the country. With World War I came the massive suppression of the German language in the US that eventually led to language shift of most Pennsylvania German speakers, leaving the Amish and other Old Orders as almost the only speakers by the end of the 20th century. This created a language barrier around the Amish that did not exist before in that form.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013, p. 122. In the late 1920s, the more change minded faction of the Old Order Amish, that wanted to adopt the car, broke away from the mainstream and organized under the name Beachy Amish. During the Second World War, the old question of military service for the Amish came up again. Because Amish young men in general refused military service, they ended up in the Civilian Public Service (CPS), where they worked mainly in forestry and hospitals. The fact that many young men worked in hospitals, where they had a lot of contact with more progressive Mennonites and the outside world, had the result that many of these men never joined the Amish church. In the 1950s, the Beachy Amish transformed into an evangelical church. The ones who wanted to preserve the old way of the Beachy became the Old Beachy Amish. Until about 1950, almost all Amish children attended small, local, non-Amish schools, but then school consolidation and mandatory schooling beyond eighth grade caused Amish opposition. Amish communities opened their own Amish schools. In 1972, the United States Supreme Court exempted Amish pupils from compulsory education past eighth grade. By the end of the 20th century, almost all Amish children attended Amish schools.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt (2013). The Amish. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 250‚Äì55. In the last quarter of the 20th century, a growing number of Amish men left farm work and started small businesses because of increasing pressure on small-scale farming. Though a wide variety of small businesses exists among the Amish, construction work and woodworking are quite widespread.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson- Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish, Baltimore: 2013, p. 294. In many Amish settlements, especially the larger ones, farmers are now a minority.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Pres, 2013, pp. 281‚Äì82. Approximately 12,000 of the 40,000 dairy farms in the United States are Amish-owned as of 2018. Until the early 20th century, Old Order Amish identity was not linked to the use of technologies, as the Old Order Amish and their rural neighbors used the same farm and household technologies. Questions about the use of technologies also did not play a role in the Old Order division of the second half of the 19th century. Telephones were the first important technology that was rejected, soon followed by the rejection of cars, tractors, radios, and many other technological inventions of the 20th century.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Pres, 2013, p. 313. ==Religious practices== A scan of the historical document Two key concepts for understanding Amish practices are their rejection of (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) and the high value they place on (humility) and (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as \\"submission\\" or \\"letting-be\\". is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Amish's willingness to submit to the \\"Will of Jesus\\", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti- individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on the community. Modern innovations such as electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity. Electric power lines would be going against the Bible, which says that you shall not be \\"conformed to the world\\" (). ==Way of life== Amish couple in horse-driven buggy in rural Holmes County, Ohio, September 2004 Amish lifestyle is regulated by the (\\"order\\"), which differs slightly from community to community and from district to district within a community. What is acceptable in one community may not be acceptable in another. The is agreed upon ‚Äì or changed ‚Äì within the whole community of baptized members prior to Communion which takes place two times a year. The meeting where the is discussed is called in Standard German and in Pennsylvania Dutch. The include matters such as dress, permissible uses of technology, religious duties, and rules regarding interaction with outsiders. In these meetings, women also vote in questions concerning the . Bearing children, raising them, and socializing with neighbors and relatives are the greatest functions of the Amish family. Amish typically believe that large families are a blessing from God. Farm families tend to have larger families, because sons are needed to perform farm labor. Community is central to the Amish way of life. Working hard is considered godly, and some technological advancements have been considered undesirable because they reduce the need for hard work. Machines such as automatic floor cleaners in barns have historically been rejected as this provides young farmhands with too much free time. Clothing The Amish are known for their plain attire. Men wear solid colored shirts, broad-brimmed hats, and suits that signify similarity amongst one another. Amish men grow beards to symbolize manhood and marital status, as well as to promote humility. They are forbidden to grow mustaches because mustaches are seen by the Amish as being affiliated with the military, which they are strongly opposed to, due to their pacifist beliefs. Women have similar guidelines on how to dress, which are also expressed in the , the Amish version of legislation. They are to wear calf-length dresses, muted colors along with bonnets and aprons. Prayer caps or bonnets are worn by the women because they are a visual representation of their religious beliefs and promote unity through the tradition of every women wearing one. The color of the bonnet signifies whether a woman is single or married. Single women wear black bonnets and married women wear white. The color coding of bonnets is important because women are not allowed to wear jewelry, such as wedding rings, as it is seen as drawing attention to the body which can induce pride in the individual. All clothing is sewn by hand, but the way to fasten the garment widely depends on whether the Amish person is a part of the New Order or Old Order Amish. The Old Order Amish seldom, if ever, use buttons because they are seen as too flashy; instead, they use the hook and eye approach to fashion clothing or metal snaps. The New Order Amish are slightly more progressive and allow the usage of buttons to help attire clothing. Cuisine Amish cuisine is noted for its simplicity and traditional qualities. Food plays an important part in Amish social life and is served at potlucks, weddings, fundraisers, farewells, and other events.Sherry Gore Zondervan. Simply Delicious Amish Cooking].Zondervan, 2013.Lovina Eicher. The Amish Cook at Home: Simple Pleasures of Food, Family, and Faith. 2008. Many Amish foods are sold at markets including pies, preserves, bread mixes, pickled produce, desserts, and canned goods. Many Amish communities have also established restaurants for visitors. Amish meat consumption is similar to the American average though they tend to eat more preserved meat.Gebra Cuyun Carter. Food Intake, Dietary Practices...Among the Amish 2008. ==Subgroups== Over the years, the Amish churches have divided many times mostly over questions concerning the Ordnung, but also over doctrinal disputes, mainly about shunning. The largest group, the \\"Old Order\\" Amish, a conservative faction that separated from other Amish in the 1860s, are those who have most emphasized traditional practices and beliefs. The New Order Amish are a group of Amish whom some scholars see best described as a subgroup of Old Order Amish, despite the name. Affiliations About 40 different Old Order Amish affiliations are known; the eight major affiliations are below, with Lancaster as the largest one in number of districts and population:Kraybill, Donald B., Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, and Steven M. Nolt (eds.). The Amish. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013, p. 139. {  - ! Affiliation !! Date established !! Origin !! States !! Settlements !!

The use of cars is not allowed by any Old and New Order Amish, nor are radio, television, or in most cases the use of the Internet. The three affiliations: \\"Lancaster\\", \\"Holmes Old Order\\", and \\"Elkhart-LaGrange\\" are not only the three largest affiliations, but they also represent the mainstream among the Old Order Amish. The most conservative affiliations are above, the most modern ones below. Technologies used by very few are on the left; the ones used by most are on the right. The percentage of all Amish who use a technology is also indicated approximately. The Old Order Amish culture involves lower greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors and activities with the exception of diet, and their per-person emissions has been estimated to be less than one quarter that of the wider society.‚Äò‚Äô Language Most Old Order Amish speak Pennsylvania Dutch, and refer to non-Amish people as \\"English\\", regardless of ethnicity. Some Amish who migrated to the United States in the 1850s speak a form of Bernese German or a Low Alemannic Alsatian dialect. Contrary to popular belief, the word \\"Dutch\\" in \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\" is not a mistranslation, but rather a corruption of the Pennsylvania German endonym , which means \\"Pennsylvania Dutch / German\\" or \\"German\\".Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, p. 606.Mark L. Louden: Pennsylvania Dutch: The Story of an American Language. JHU Press, 2006, p.2Hostetler, John A. (1993), Amish Society, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. 241Irwin Richman: The Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Arcadia Publishing, 2004, p.16. Ultimately, the terms Deitsch, Dutch, Diets and Deutsch are all cognates of the Proto-Germanic word meaning \\"popular\\" or \\"of the people\\".W. Haubrichs, \\"Theodiscus, Deutsch und Germanisch - drei Ethnonyme, drei Forschungsbegriffe. Zur Frage der Instrumentalisierung und Wertbesetzung deutscher Sprach- und Volksbezeichnungen.\\" In: H. Beck et al., Zur Geschichte der Gleichung \\"germanisch-deutsch\\" (2004), 199-228 The continued use of \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\" was strengthened by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 19th century as a way of distinguishing themselves from later (post 1830) waves of German immigrants to the United States, with the Pennsylvania Dutch referring to themselves as and to Germans as (literally \\"Germany-ers\\", compare ) whom they saw as a related but distinct group.Mark L. Louden: Pennsylvania Dutch: The Story of an American Language. JHU Press, 2006, p.3-4 According to one scholar, \\"today, almost all Amish are functionally bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English; however, domains of usage are sharply separated. Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish. Finally, the Amish read prayers and sing in Standard German (which, in Pennsylvania Dutch, is called is the Pennsylvania Dutch equivalent of the Standard German word ; both words literally mean \\"High German\\".) at church services. The distinctive use of three different languages serves as a powerful conveyor of Amish identity. \\"Although 'the English language is being used in more and more situations,' Pennsylvania Dutch is 'one of a handful of minority languages in the United States that is neither endangered nor supported by continual arrivals of immigrants.'\\" Ethnicity The Amish largely share a German or Swiss-German ancestry.Hugh F. Gingerich and Rachel W. Kreider. Revised Amish and Amish Mennonite Genealogies. Morgantown, Penn.: 2007. This comprehensive volume gives names, dates, and places of births and deaths, and relationships of most of the known people of this unique sect from the early 1700s until about 1860 or so. The authors also include a five-page \\"History of the First Amish Communities in America\\". They generally use the term \\"Amish\\" only for members of their faith community and not as an ethnic designation. However some Amish descendants recognize their cultural background knowing that their genetic and cultural traits are uniquely different from other ethnicities. Those who choose to affiliate with the church, or young children raised in Amish homes, but too young to yet be church members, are considered to be Amish. Certain Mennonite churches have a high number of people who were formerly from Amish congregations. Although more Amish immigrated to North America in the 19th century than during the 18th century, most of today's Amish descend from 18th- century immigrants. The latter tended to emphasize tradition to a greater extent, and were perhaps more likely to maintain a separate Amish identity. There are a number of Amish Mennonite church groups that had never in their history been associated with the Old Order Amish because they split from the Amish mainstream in the time when the Old Orders formed in the 1860s and 1870s. The former Western Ontario Mennonite Conference (WOMC) was made up almost entirely of former Amish Mennonites who reunited with the Mennonite Church in Canada. Orland Gingerich's book The Amish of Canada devotes the vast majority of its pages not to the Beachy or Old Order Amish, but to congregations in the former WOMC. Para-Amish groups Several other groups, called \\"para-Amish\\" by G. C. Waldrep and others, share many characteristics with the Amish, such as horse and buggy transportation, plain dress, and the preservation of the German language. The members of these groups are largely of Amish origin, but they are not in fellowship with other Amish groups because they adhere to theological doctrines (e.g., assurance of salvation) or practices (community of goods) that are normally not accepted among mainstream Amish. The Bergholz Community is a different case, it is not seen as Amish anymore because the community has shifted away from many core Amish principles. ==Population and distribution== Because the Amish are usually baptized no earlier than 18 and children are not counted in local congregation numbers, estimating their numbers is difficult. Rough estimates from various studies placed their numbers at 125,000 in 1992, 166,000 in 2000, and 221,000 in 2008. Thus, from 1992 to 2008, population growth among the Amish in North America was 84 percent (3.6 percent per year). During that time, they established 184 new settlements and moved into six new states. In 2000, about 165,620 Old Order Amish resided in the United States, of whom 73,609 were church members. The Amish are among the fastest-growing populations in the world, with an average of seven children per family in the 1970s and a total fertility rate of 5.3 in the 2010s. In 2010, a few religious bodies, including the Amish, changed the way their adherents were reported to better match the standards of the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies. When looking at all Amish adherents and not solely Old Order Amish, about 241,000 Amish adherents were in 28 U.S. states in 2010.

In 2020, Old Order communities were present in 31 U.S. states. The total Amish population in United States has stood at 344,670 up 8,435 or 2.5%, compared to the previous year. Pennsylvania has the largest population (81,5 thousand), followed by Ohio (78,3 thousand) and Indiana (59,3 thousand), . The largest Amish settlements are in Lancaster County in southeastern Pennsylvania (40,525), Holmes County and adjacent counties in northeastern Ohio (36,955), and Elkhart and LaGrange counties in northeastern Indiana (26,380), . Nearly 50% of the population in Holmes County is Amish. The largest concentration of Amish west of the Mississippi River is in Missouri, with other settlements in eastern Iowa and southeast Minnesota. The largest Amish settlements in Iowa are located near Kalona and Bloomfield. The largest settlement in Wisconsin is near Cashton with 13 congregations, i.e. about 2,000 people in 2009.\\"Wisconsin Amish: Cashton\\" at amishamerica.com. Because of rapid population growth in Amish communities, new settlements are formed to obtain enough affordable farmland. Other reasons for new settlements include locating in isolated areas that support their lifestyle, moving to areas with cultures conducive to their way of life, maintaining proximity to family or other Amish groups, and sometimes to resolve church or leadership conflicts. The adjacent table shows the eight states with the largest Amish population in the years 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2020.2010 U.S. Religion Census, official website. Canada Amish settlements are in four Canadian provinces: Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, and New Brunswick. The majority of Old Order settlements is located in the province of Ontario, namely Oxford (Norwich Township) and Norfolk Counties. A small community is also established in Bruce County (Huron-Kinloss Township) near Lucknow. { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" style=\\"text-align: right;\\" width=\\"30%\\" - ! data-sort-type=\\"text\\"  Canada ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 1992 ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 2010 ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 2020 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Canada:  2,295  4,725  5,995 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  > Ontario  2,295 4,725  5,605 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  > Prince Edward Island  0  0  250 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  > Manitoba  0  0  70 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  > New Brunswick  0  0  70 - } In 2016, several dozen Old Order Amish families founded two new settlements in Kings County in the province of Prince Edward Island. Increasing land prices in Ontario had reportedly limited the ability of members in those communities to purchase new farms. At about the same time a new settlement was founded near Perth-Andover in New Brunswick, only about 12 km from Amish settlements in Maine. In 2017, an Amish settlement was founded in Manitoba near Stuartburn.Amish Moving To Fourth Canadian Province at amishamerica.com. Latin America Amish settlements are currently in two South American nations: Argentina and Bolivia. The majority of Old Order settlements are located in the country of Bolivia. The first attempt by Old Order Amish to settle in Latin America was in Paradise Valley, near Galeana, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, but the settlement only lasted from 1923 to 1929. An Amish settlement was tried in Honduras from about 1968 to 1978, but this settlement failed too. In 2015, new settlements of New Order Amish were founded east of Catamarca, Argentina, and Colonia Naranjita, Bolivia, about southwest of Santa Cruz. Most of the members of these new communities come from Old Colony Mennonite background and have been living in the area for several decades.Amish Population Profile, 2018 at Amish Studies ‚Äì The Young Center. { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" style=\\"text-align: right;\\" width=\\"30%\\" - ! data-sort-type=\\"text\\"  South America ! data-sort- type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 2010 ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 2019 ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Amish pop. in 2020 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Bolivia  0  150  160 -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Argentina  0  50  50 } Europe In Europe, no split occurred between Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites; like the Amish Mennonites in North America, the European Amish assimilated into the Mennonite mainstream during the second half of the 19th century through the first decades of the 20th century. Eventually, they dropped the word \\"Amish\\" from the names of their congregations and lost their Amish identity and culture. The last European Amish congregation joined the Mennonites in 1937 in Ixheim, today part of Zweibr√ºcken in the Palatinate region. ==Seekers and joiners== Only a few hundred outsiders, so-called seekers, have ever joined the Amish. Since 1950, only some 75 non-Anabaptist people have joined and remained lifelong members of the Amish.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson- Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish. Baltimore: 2013, p. 159. Since 1990, some twenty people of Russian Mennonite background have joined the Amish in Aylmer, Ontario.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. The Amish. Baltimore: 2013, pp. 160f. Two whole Christian communities have joined the Amish: The church at Smyrna, Maine, one of the five Christian Communities of Elmo Stoll after Stoll's death and the church at Manton, Michigan, which belonged to a community that was founded by Harry Wanner (1935‚Äì2012), a minister of Stauffer Old Order Mennonite background. The \\"Michigan Churches\\", with which Smyrna and Manton affiliated, are said to be more open to seekers and converts than other Amish churches. Most of the members of these two para- Amish communities originally came from Plain churches, i.e. Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite, or Old German Baptist Brethren. More people have tested Amish life for weeks, months, or even years, but in the end decided not to join. Others remain close to the Amish, but never think of joining. Stephen Scott, himself a convert to the Old Order River Brethren, distinguishes four types of seekers: * Checklist seekers are looking for a few certain specifications. * Cultural seekers are more enchanted with the lifestyle of the Amish than with their religion. * Spiritual utopian seekers are looking for true New Testament Christianity. * Stability seekers come with emotional issues, often from dysfunctional families. ==Health== Amish farm near Morristown, New York Amish populations have higher incidences of particular conditions, including dwarfism, Angelman syndrome, and various metabolic disorders, as well as an unusual distribution of blood types. The Amish represent a collection of different demes or genetically closed communities. Although the Amish do not have higher incidence of genetic disorders than the general population, since almost all Amish descend from a few hundred 18th- century founders, some recessive conditions are more prevalent (an example of the founder effect). Some of these disorders are rare or unique, and are serious enough to increase the mortality rate among Amish children. The Amish are aware of the advantages of exogamy, but for religious reasons, marry only within their communities. The majority of Amish accepts these as (God's will); they reject the use of preventive genetic tests prior to marriage and genetic testing of unborn children to discover genetic disorders. When a child is born with a disorder, it is accepted into the community and tasked with chores within their ability. However, Amish are willing to participate in studies of genetic diseases. Their extensive family histories are useful to researchers investigating diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and macular degeneration. While the Amish are at an increased risk for some genetic disorders, researchers have found their tendency for clean living can lead to better health. Overall cancer rates in the Amish are reduced and tobacco- related cancers in Amish adults are 37% and non-tobacco-related cancers are 72% of the rate for Ohio adults. Even skin cancer rates are lower for Amish, even though many Amish make their living working outdoors where they are exposed to sunlight. They are typically covered and dressed by wearing wide- brimmed hats and long sleeves which protect their skin. Treating genetic problems is the mission of Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, which has developed effective treatments for such problems as maple syrup urine disease, a previously fatal disease. The clinic is embraced by most Amish, ending the need for parents to leave the community to receive proper care for their children, an action that might result in shunning. Another clinic is DDC Clinic for Special Needs Children, located in Middlefield, Ohio, for special-needs children with inherited or metabolic disorders. The DDC Clinic provides treatment, research, and educational services to Amish and non-Amish children and their families. People's Helpers is an Amish-organized network of mental health caregivers who help families dealing with mental illness and recommend professional counselors. Suicide rates for the Amish are about half that of the general population. The Old Order Amish do not typically carry private commercial health insurance. A handful of American hospitals, starting in the mid-1990s, created special outreach programs to assist the Amish. In some Amish communities, the church will collect money from its members to help pay for medical bills of other members. Although not forbidden, most Amish do not practice any form of birth control. They are against abortion and also find \\"artificial insemination, genetics, eugenics, and stem cell research\\" to be \\"inconsistent with Amish values and beliefs\\". However, some communities allow access to birth control to women whose health would be compromised by childbirth. ==Life in the modern world== Traditional, Lancaster style Amish buggy Amish school near Rebersburg, Pennsylvania As time has passed, the Amish have felt pressures from the modern world. Issues such as taxation, education, law and its enforcement, and occasional discrimination and hostility are areas of difficulty. The modern way of life in general has increasingly diverged from that of Amish society. On occasion, this has resulted in sporadic discrimination and hostility from their neighbors, such as throwing of stones or other objects at Amish horse- drawn carriages on the roads. The Amish do not usually educate their children past the eighth grade, believing that the basic knowledge offered up to that point is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle. Almost no Amish go to high school and college. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically one-room schoolhouses with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from the Amish community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction,Wisconsin v. Yoder, 182 N.W.2d 539 (Wis. 1971). and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (1972). The Amish are subject to sales and property taxes. As they seldom own motor vehicles, they rarely have occasion to pay motor vehicle registration fees or spend money in the purchase of fuel for vehicles. Under their beliefs and traditions, generally the Amish do not agree with the idea of Social Security benefits and have a religious objection to insurance. On this basis, the United States Internal Revenue Service agreed in 1961 that they did not need to pay Social Security-related taxes. In 1965, this policy was codified into law. Self-employed individuals in certain sects do not pay into or receive benefits from the United States Social Security system. This exemption applies to a religious group that is conscientiously opposed to accepting benefits of any private or public insurance, provides a reasonable level of living for its dependent members, and has existed continuously since December 31, 1950. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified in 1982 that Amish employers are not exempt, but only those Amish individuals who are self-employed. ==Publishing== In 1964, Pathway Publishers was founded by two Amish farmers to print more material about the Amish and Anabaptists in general. It is located in Lagrange, Indiana, and Aylmer, Ontario. Pathway has become the major publisher of Amish school textbooks, general-reading books, and periodicals. Also, a number of private enterprises publish everything from general reading to reprints of older literature that has been considered of great value to Amish families. Some Amish read the Pennsylvania German newspaper , and some of them even contribute dialect texts. ==Similar groups== Groups that sprang from the same late 19th century Old Order Movement as the Amish share their Pennsylvania German heritage and often still retain similar features in dress. These Old Order groups include different subgroups of Old Order Mennonites, traditional Schwarzenau Brethren and Old Order River Brethren. The Noah Hoover Old Order Mennonites are so similar in outward aspects to the Old Order Amish (dress, beards, horse and buggy, extreme restrictions on modern technology, Pennsylvania German language), that they are often perceived as Amish and even called Amish. Conservative \\"Russian\\" Mennonites and Hutterites who also dress plain and speak German dialects emigrated from other European regions at a different time with different German dialects, separate cultures, and related but different religious traditions. Particularly, the Hutterites live communally and are generally accepting of modern technology. The few remaining Plain Quakers are similar in manner and lifestyle, including their attitudes toward war, but are unrelated to the Amish. Early Quakers were influenced, to some degree, by the Anabaptists, and in turn influenced the Amish in colonial Pennsylvania. Almost all modern Quakers have since abandoned their traditional dress. ==Relations with Native Americans== The Northkill Amish Settlement, established in 1740 in Berks County, Pennsylvania, was the first identifiable Amish community in the new world. During the French and Indian War, the so- called Hochstetler Massacre occurred: Local tribes attacked the Jacob Hochstetler homestead in the Northkill settlement on September 19, 1757. The sons of the family took their weapons but father Jacob did not allow them to shoot. Jacob Sr.'s wife, Anna (Lorentz) Hochstetler, a daughter (name unknown) and Jacob Jr. were killed by the Native Americans. Jacob Sr. and sons Joseph and Christian were taken captive. Jacob escaped after about eight months, but the boys were held for several years. As early as 1809 Amish were farming side by side with Native American farmers in Pennsylvania. According to Cones Kupwah Snowflower, a Shawnee genealogist, the Amish and Quakers were known to incorporate Native Americans into their families to protect them from ill- treatment, especially after the Removal Act of 1832.Cones Kupwah Snowflower in NAAH No. July 14, 1996 \\"Let's Get Physical\\" The Amish, as pacifists, did not engage in warfare with Native Americans, nor displace them directly, but were among the European immigrants whose arrival resulted in their displacement. In 2012, the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society collaborated with the Native American community to construct a replica Iroquois Longhouse. ==In popular cultureSee also== * Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center * Amish furniture * Amish music * Barn raising * Bank of Bird-in-Hand * Christian views on poverty and wealth * Fancy Dutch * List of Amish and their descendants * Martyrs Mirror * Pinecraft * Plain people * West Nickel Mines School shooting ==NotesReferencesBibliography== * . * Kraybill, Donald B., Karen M.

It starts with a parade on 18 September, celebrating the liberation of Eindhoven during World War II on that date in 1944. The Lichtjesroute is celebrated not only to commemorate the liberation, but also to create an illusion of \\"fairytales in light\\". ==Origin== During the first commemoration of the liberation of Eindhoven, a (Committee of Party Lighting) was formed. Committee members included the Municipal Energy company , Philips, the Federation of Neighbourhood Associations (), the Eindhoven Installer Association (), and the tourist board Association for Foreign Traffic (). The committee had the idea to give the celebrations some extra light. The inhabitants of Eindhoven were asked to help by making their houses shine in any way possible for one day. Because many things were still in short supply so soon after the war, this was mostly restricted to candles at the windows. After 1947, the Foundation for Liberation Commemoration () took over coordination of all festival activities. The original day of lights was transformed into a \\"route of lights\\". In several places throughout the city, dubbed Focal Points or Fire Points (), celebration lighting illuminated the area for four days, between 20:00 and 24:00 each day. In the following years, the amount of Fire Points grew steadily. By 1969, 25 years after the liberation, the route had grown to a length of no less than . This would be the last year the Lichtjesroute was celebrated for more than a decade. In 1984, a number of enthusiasts decided it was time to give the Lichtjesroute a new life. Through a mailing, a thousand corporations were asked for financial support, and the local media called for volunteers to help make the new Lichtjesroute a reality. ==The route today== A depiction of thumb The Lichtjesroute, as revived in 1984, consists of a route through the centre of Eindhoven and through the suburbs of Stratum, Strijp, and Woensel. The route is about long and is especially popular with smaller children. Families usually travel the route by car; officials have also made it friendly for cyclists who want to follow the route. The route is indicated by reflecting \\"pointer\\" signs that show an arrow and a red picture of a light bulb. On some signs, the text (cycle route) is also added, to indicate areas where cyclists should follow an alternate route. Along the route, various frames with ornaments made from lights are mounted onto lamp posts. The ornaments depict various objects and animals; some have World War II‚Äìthemed imagery. Ornaments are usually grouped by common themes‚Äîall animals are located together, for example. The placement of the ornaments changes each year, but in some places, the same ornaments are shown each year. For example, (\\"Half-moon Street\\") is always decorated with half-moon crescent shapes. The area always has ornaments of astrological signs, because the streets there are named after characters from Greek and Roman mythology. In (\\"White Village\\"), there are no ornaments‚Äîbut red, white, and blue lamps, symbolic of the flag of the Netherlands, are placed on the bay windows, where they shine onto the white houses. Special resting places are designated on the route, where people can stop for a snack or walk around; one such area is , a square and small park in a residential area. These points are usually the busiest on the route, and as a result, traffic jams are common there. ==Sustainability== In 2006, the Foundation started replacing the incandescent light bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LEDs); an initial batch of one thousand LED bulbs was installed. Over time, the incandescent lights will be retired; wholesale replacement of the existing bulbs would be too expensive. Compact fluorescent lamps, used to save energy in other applications, are not a viable solution because they are not suitable for outside lighting. == External links == * De Lichtjesroute Category:Culture in Eindhoven Category:Festivals in the Netherlands Category:Tourist attractions in North Brabant Category:Autumn events in the Netherlands ","title":"Lichtjesroute"},{"id":"19347018","text":"Lisa Sarah MacCormack Raitt (born May 7, 1968) is a Canadian former politician, who served as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 2017 to 2019. She was the Conservative Party deputy leader, and was the Member of Parliament for the Ontario riding of Milton from 2015 to 2019, having previously represented Halton from 2008 to 2015. She is a professional administrator (1999‚Äì2008) turned politician (2008‚Äì2019). Raitt served in several portfolios as a minister in the 28th Canadian Ministry of Stephen Harper. ==Background== Raitt was born Lisa Sarah MacCormack in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and raised as the youngest of seven children. It was not until her early teens that she learned that the couple she thought were her parents were actually her grandparents, and that the woman she believed was her sister was her mother, who as a young unmarried woman had almost given up her daughter for adoption. Her grandfather, Colin A. MacCormack, worked for a local coal mine, loading coal onto ships, and later served as city alderman, and secretary-treasurer and a lead negotiator for the Cape Breton Railway Transportation and General Workers. Her grandmother, Mary Christina \\"Tootsie\\" (Gillis), was a businesswoman.http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NS-CAPE- BRETON/2004-01/1074136650 As a child, she participated in Girl Guides of Canada programs as a youth member. Raitt was married to Second City alumnus, playwright, and stay-at-home dad David Raitt and has two sons, John Colin (b. 2001) and Billy (b. 2004); they are now divorced. On September 2, 2016, she married her longtime partner, Bruce Wood, the President and CEO of the Hamilton Port Authority. Raitt graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia with a Bachelor of Science. She went on to do a master's degree in chemistry, specializing in environmental biochemical toxicology, at the University of Guelph. Raitt possesses an LL.B from Osgoode Hall Law School, and was called to the Ontario bar in 1998. That year, she was granted a Dr. Harold G. Fox Scholarship. As a result, she trained with barristers of the Middle Temple in London, United Kingdom, which specialized in international trade, commerce, transportation, and arbitration. == Toronto Port Authority (1999‚Äì2008) == Raitt served as the TPA's Corporate Secretary and General Counsel, and harbourmaster from April 2001. She was the first female harbourmaster of a Canadian port.. In 2002, Raitt was appointed as president and chief executive officer of the Toronto Port Authority (TPA), a Canadian federal corporation that manages the Toronto Harbour as well as the Toronto City Centre Airport. See relinquished the post of harbourmaster to Angus Armstrong in 2004.  General Counsel  As General Counsel for the TPA, she filed a $1 billion lawsuit over of land that was transferred in the 1990s to the City of Toronto's Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO) by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). The disputed lands, mostly the infill lands of the Don River delta, constituted around 85% of the THC's land assets as of the early 1990s. The lands had been transferred in two separate agreements, in 1991 and 1994 in exchange for a permanent subsidy for the THC. The TPA's legal claim was that the transfer had been done while the majority of directors of the THC were City-appointed, and who had acted in the city's interest and not in the commission's fiduciary interest, and that the deals crippled the THC's ability to be self-sufficient by ending any potential revenues from those lands. Since the TPA was inheriting the role and activities of the THC, it was thus crippled itself.Tass√©(2006), pp.35‚Äì37 The TPA and the City settled out of court in exchange for a promised bridge to the Island Airport across the Western Gap and approximately $50 million. The bridge was never built; instead a pedestrian tunnel under the Western Gap was constructed and completed on July 30, 2015.  CEO  As CEO of the TPA, Raitt was responsible for building the International Marine Passenger Terminal, a Toronto home for the now-defunct Canadian American Transportation Systems, a Rochester, New York- based group. The ground was broken on 24 August 2004, and CATS operated for six months in 2005. The Rochester firm that initially owned the ferry had a 14-year lease on the use of the terminal that would have paid the City of Toronto $250,000 per year. The terminal was reported to have cost $10.5 million to construct, which makes a 0.33 cost recovery factor. The lease was terminated in December 2009 after payment of a $90,000 settlement. The terminal has seen little use since then except to dock cruise ships and as a movie set. During her time as CEO of the TPA, the Air Canada Jazz service to the Toronto City Centre Airport was discontinued under a legal cloud. Raitt was responsible for the new TCCA1 ferry for passengers at the Toronto City Centre Airport, which is located at the western end of the Toronto Islands. * Raitt was quoted as \\"proud to have assisted in the remarkable growth of Porter Airlines\\" in her time at the TPA.  Mismanagement allegations  New Democrat MP Olivia Chow called on Sheila Fraser, the federal auditor general, to conduct an audit of the port authority to investigate why Baird increased the membership of the board of directors from seven to nine - and why Raitt, while CEO of the authority, was allowed to run up almost $80,000 in travel and other expenses over two years. A November 2009 report by the Toronto Star claimed that Raitt signed off on her own expenses inappropriately, but the TPA claimed the Star's report was inaccurate. This followed another story in the Toronto Star that a TPA employee used the office computer to send emails about a Conservative fundraiser event. After an independent forensic review conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Toronto Port Authority released the results on September 14, 2010. These results showed that \\"all but one of the 15 complaints lodged by the former Directors were groundless\\". ==Federal politics== Raitt in 2009 In September 2008, Raitt was appointed to run as the Conservative candidate in Halton against Liberal incumbent Garth Turner. Turner was formerly a Conservative MP but he was suspended from the Conservative caucus in 2006 for breaching confidentiality. He later joined the Liberals after briefly sitting as an independent member. Raitt defeated Turner in the October 14, 2008, election. Minister of Natural Resources Raitt was appointed to the Cabinet of Canada on October 30, 2008, as Minister of Natural Resources. She was one of eleven women named to the Cabinet. At an October 6, 2009, meeting of the Oakville, Ontario, Chamber of Commerce, Raitt was on record discussing the possibilities of increased tourism and shipping opportunities in the North due to the melting polar ice cap. Jasmine MacDonnell incident On June 2, 2009, CTV News reported that a folder of confidential and secret ministerial briefing documents had been left by Raitt or her staff at the CTV News Ottawa office for a week. CTV News chose to reveal the contents which listed the funding for the Chalk River nuclear reactor which had recently shut down, causing a shortage of medical radioisotopes. There was also an audio tape, made on January 30, 2009, with Raitt and the aide. On June 3, the opposition parties demanded that the government fire Raitt or accept her resignation. Raitt claimed to have offered her resignation and that the offer was rejected by the Prime Minister. A ministerial aide, Raitt's 26-year-old director of communications, Jasmine MacDonnell, offered her resignation which was accepted. On June 8, 2009, CBC news online reported that a Nova Scotia court heard an argument to block the Halifax Chronicle-Herald from publishing a story about an audio recording involving Raitt. The judge ruled that the public interest over-rode the issue of confidentiality. On the tape, Raitt made comments on the radio isotope issue, describing it as \\"sexy ... Radioactive leaks. Cancer.\\" and hard to control because it is \\"confusing to a lot of people\\". Raitt also made comments on the parliamentary skills of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Manitoba MP Joy Smith, who introduced a private member's bill on human trafficking: Minister of Labour On January 19, 2010, Raitt was moved from the Ministry of Natural Resources to the Ministry of Labour.parl.gc.ca: \\"Member of Parliament Profile (Current): Lisa Raitt\\" Prime Minister Harper publicly defended Raitt, saying she has \\"a great future.\\" The Ottawa Citizen and National Post reported Raitt's appearance at Lester B. Pearson Airport on March 22, 2012, and subsequent reaction by Air Canada baggage handlers was the reason a wildcat strike occurred the next day. According to Bill Trbovich, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW), Raitt was walking through the airport when three workers started \\"clapping and saying ‚ÄòOh, great job‚Äô. Raitt is alleged to have asked the RCMP to ‚Äòarrest these animals‚Äô. The strike caused widespread disruption to Air Canada schedule, causing flight cancellations and delays. Raitt's office denied the allegation. In 2011, Raitt used back to work legislation twice to end strikes by Air Canada's flight attendants and by employees of Canada Post. The following year she threatened to legislate workers with the Canadian Pacific Railway back to work on the first day of their strike. On each occasion she cited the country's fragile economy as the reason for using back to work legislation. When Raitt was shuffled out of the Labour portfolio she received praise from both opposition critics and union leaders for her work as minister. Liberal MP Rodger Cuzner described Raitt as \\"tough, quick, funny and hard-working ‚Äî she can give as good as she gets.\\" Phil Benson of the Teamsters union said \\"she had an open door policy with us, was professional, courteous and good to deal with,\\" and that he looked forward to working with her as Transportation Minister. Minister of Transport Raitt was named Minister of Transport on July 15, 2013, nine days after the Lac-M√©gantic derailment. She replaced Denis Lebel, MP for Roberval-Lac-Saint-Jean who was previously Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. With her promotion to the transportation file she was considered to be one of the most senior women in cabinet, along with Public Works Minister Diane Finley. Rail safety On July 9, 2013, the Ministry of Transport was in full damage control mode owing to the LMD. Two Directors (Marie-France Dagenais and Luc Bourdon), and an Associate Deputy Minister (Gerard McDonald) tried to finesse their delayed reaction to a scathing December 2011 report by the Auditor General of Canada on rail safety.\\"Transport Canada vowed to fix inadequate oversight of dangerous goods transportation in 2011\\" o.canada 9 July 2013 Raitt took over the Ministry on July 15. She issued a directive sometime in autumn 2013 requiring railways to inform municipalities about the kinds of dangerous goods they were carting through their communities, but a spokesman for Canadian National said on 8 January 2014, upon the occurrence of the hazardous derailment (PRD) near Plaster Rock, New Brunswick,G+M: \\"New Brunswick train derailment fire renews questions of oil-by-rail‚Äôs dangers\\" 8 Jan 2014 that it was too soon for those regulations to have come into effect.G+M: \\"Train derailment and fire involving crude oil tankers likely caused by brake malfunction\\" 8 jan 2014 Prime Minister Stephen Harper was forced to intervene during a stop in Inuvik on January 8, 2014, and said: \\"We have made significant investments in rail safety and rail inspections,\\" he said. \\"We have increased both of those vastly.\\"  Windsor Detroit Bridge Authority  On July 30, 2014, she appointed Caroline Mulroney, her long-time friend, and three other individuals, including Mark R. McQueen, who was an employer of Mulroney (under the name Lapham) at Wellington Financialhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinelapham/ and also was a former employee of Brian Mulroney's Prime Minister's office,https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2009/10/18/mark_mcqueen_czar_of_the_toronto_waterfront.html to the Windsor Detroit Bridge Authority, a body to oversee a second bridge across the Detroit River that separates Windsor, Ontario from Detroit, Michigan. Tom Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, mocked her appointment, as an instance of the kind of corruption her father was suspected of. The Business News Network noted: \\"The Harper government hasn't explained yet what Mulroney Lapham's qualifications are to serve as a director of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority.\\" Conservative leadership Shortly after her promotion to the Ministry of Transport, National Post columnist John Ivison wrote that Raitt was quickly becoming a contender to succeed Prime Minister Stephen Harper when he decided to step down. The Conservative government was defeated in the 2015 federal election, though Raitt was elected in Milton, essentially the western part of her old riding. In the aftermath of the Conservative defeat, Raitt was one of several names commonly mentioned as a potential leadership candidate. Raitt had said she is \\"seriously considering\\" a bid for the party leadership. On October 14, 2016, Raitt stepped down as finance critic. On November 2, 2016, Raitt announced via Facebook that she was running for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada, though she eventually lost to Andrew Scheer. After the 2014 Ontario election, Raitt was considered to be a contender to replace Tim Hudak for the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. However, she declined the opportunity due to health issues. In 2018, after Patrick Brown resigned over accusation of sexual assault, Raitt was named as a possible contender for the leadership, but announced on January 27, that she will not seek the leadership. She endorsed Caroline Mulroney and served as her campaign co- chair. In a June 7, 2019 retweet of Ross McKitrick's Financial Post opinion piece defending Roger Pielke Jr. Raitt said that the \\"Bottom line is there's no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather, despite Trudeau's claims to the contrary. The continual claim of such a link is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes.\\" Conservative Deputy Leader Raitt meeting students during a school trip to Parliament Hill in 2018. On July 20, 2017, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer named Raitt as deputy leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Official Opposition. Raitt is the first woman to hold the role for the Conservatives. When asked about the appointment, she stated she considered herself a feminist and women will 'see themselves' in her. She was defeated in the 2019 federal election by Adam van Koeverden. ==Electoral recordReferences External links == * * Category:1968 births Category:Women members of the House of Commons of Canada Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Osgoode Hall Law School alumni Category:People from Sydney, Nova Scotia Category:St. Francis Xavier University alumni Category:Women in Ontario politics Category:University of Guelph alumni Category:Mining ministers of Canada Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:Members of the 28th Canadian Ministry Category:Ministers of Labour of Canada Category:21st- century Canadian women politicians ","title":"Lisa Raitt"},{"id":"19347046","text":"HD 118889 is a binary star in the northern constellation of Bo√∂tes. ==References * HR 5138 * CCDM J13395+1045 * Image HD 118889 Category:Bo√∂tes 118889 Category:Binary stars 066640 Category:F-type main-sequence stars 5138 Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"HD 118889"},{"id":"19347060","text":"John W.

Jaitamal, a pious man, confectioner by trade, became the Guru's follower and later converted his house into a Dharamshala. It was sanctified first by Guru Nanak in 1509 A.D. and later by Guru Tegh Bahadur along with his family in 1666 A.D.Gurudwara Gai Ghat - Patna, Bihar It is believed, Guru Tegh Bahadur made the river Ganges come in the form of \\"Gai\\" (cow) to Jaitamal, who could not go to the riverbank due to his old age. The Gurdwara was thus named 'Gurdwara Gaighat'.Guru Nanak Dev,Guru Tegh Bhadur too enlightened humanity in Bihar ==Location== Gurdwara Pahila Bara is a historical Sikh shrine situated at Gaighat in the Alamganj area of Patna.

It was launched on September 16, 2008, and was discontinued in early 2012. It comprises a single chassis blade server design that supports a maximum of eight modular single-width blades, giving up to 96 processor cores. Computational load can be run independently on each blade and/or combined using clustering techniques. ==Blade configurations== Compute blade The most basic of the modular blade configurations, the single-width compute blade supports dual-socket Intel Xeon 5400, 5500, and 5600 series processors, up to eight DIMMs of DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-8500), and two 2.5\\" SATA HDDs. Furthermore, each compute blade supports the addition of a PCIe x16 card for graphics or further expansion. Originally offered with the Intel E5400 series processor, later CX1 configurations made either the low-power \\"L5xxx\\" series or the high-performance \\"X5xxx\\" series Intel processors available to customers. Depending on the blade model, both Gigabit Ethernet and DDR Infiniband interconnects were available - those blades not factory-equipped with Infiniband supported third-party additions through the PCIe expansion port. Storage blade Building on the modular expansion capabilities of the compute blade, the storage blade enabled customers to add up to eight 2.5\\" SATA HDDs or four 3.5\\" SATA HDDs to a separate, but physically connected, single-width blade add-on. This bolted on expansion took the place of the default blade cover and extended the blade unit to a two-width module. From a computational standpoint, the storage blade was no different from the compute blade, offering the same Intel processor options. Unlike the compute blade, PCIe expansion was not available in the storage blade, as the RAID card supporting the additional hard drives occupied this port. Visualization and GPU blades Similar to the storage blade expansion, both workstation visualization and GPGPU blades were offered, taking advantage of the PCIe expansion port to extend the capabilities of the base compute blade. Equipped with either workstation Nvidia Quadro graphics cards or Nvidia Tesla scientific cards, the visualization configurations extended the integrated graphics capabilities of the compute blade and offered customers access to Nvidia's CUDA programming architecture to drastically speed-up critical scientific and engineering applications. ==Unique features== In addition to offering unparalleled deskside performance for its day, the Cray CX1 also pioneered a number of unique technologies to make possible the integration of supercomputing into the traditional office space. In order to meet workplace noise requirements, the CX1 utilized an active noise cancellation system built into its cooling apparatus to quiet the sounds generated by the chassis's two large fans. Rather than requiring the deployment of separate Ethernet and/or Infiniband networks, the CX1 integrated network switches for both into the chassis to facilitate these high-speed interconnect protocols required by clustered simulations and applications. Additionally, unlike traditional servers and supercomputers that make use of higher 220 V power, the CX1's redundant power supplies were designed to support traditional office power (120 V AC, 20 A). Finally, one of the most striking and recognizable features of the CX1 is the integrated touch screen control panel on the front face of the machine from which users could not only control each of the blades, but instantly gauge power consumption, core temperature, and fan speeds for the entire chassis. ==Comparison with other Cray systems== The CX1 and XT5h are fundamentally different architectures, and due to their differences, XT5 blades may not be used in place of CX1 blades, and vice versa. To compare the two: * An XT5h supercomputer supports vector, FPGA, and scalar compute blades (X2, XR1, and XT4/XT5 blades, respectively), typically supported by service blades for network access and hosting a Lustre filesystem layered over several RAID modules. ** The XT5h's operating system is UNICOS/lc, a combination of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Sandia's Catamount or Cray's Compute Node Linux. * A CX1 supercomputer supports GPU and scalar compute blades (Nvidia Quadro and Intel Xeon, respectively), typically supported by enclosed network switches (Gigabit Ethernet, Infiniband) and service blades hosting RAID modules. ** CX1-supported operating systems include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Windows HPC Server 2008. ==External links== * Cray's First Windows-Based Supercomputer Puts a 64-Core Datacenter On Your Desk *CX1 adds shared-memory capabilities using ScaleMP's vSMP Foundation *CX1 and CX1000 discontinued - serverwatch.com Cx1 Category:X86 supercomputers ","title":"Cray CX1"},{"id":"19347175","text":"Yanna Cholaeva (born August 8, 1985) is a Russian female acrobatic gymnast.

Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes unionized workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc. ==History== There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on due process, and union and non-union grievance procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on rights-based conflict resolution between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants. In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the \\"interests\\" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict‚Äîand on systems change‚Äîas well as resolving grievances. These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeim, Mary Rowe, and Mary Rowe and Michael Baker, described a systems approach for dealing with complaints‚Äîand all kinds of disputes‚Äîwithin organizations.Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)Mary P. Rowe, PhD, \\"Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?\\" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May‚ÄìJune, 1984), pp. 127‚Äì136Mary P. Rowe, \\"The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model,\\" in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10‚Äì18. Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,\\"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems\\" (NY: Praeger, 1988) William L. Ury, Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993) (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights- based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. HassonSlaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems. The concept of an integrated conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.See \\"People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options\\" in Negotiation Journal, April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161‚Äì172. The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be \\"managed\\" by the organization‚Äîor whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in \\"integrating\\" a system, with some observers preferring the idea of \\"coordinating\\" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky et al., suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having \\"integrated conflict management systems,\\" or \\"ICMS.\\" There is also a major need to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed about important specialized issues like free speech. A number of artificial intelligence technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the belief‚Äìdesire‚Äìintention model. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa \\"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management\\" Information Sciences Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011) ==See also== * Alternative dispute resolution * Bystander effect * Dispute Systems Design * Eight Disciplines Problem Solving * Grievance (labour) * Mediation * Organizational ombudsman * Whistleblower ==NotesAdditional references== * Lynch, Q.C., Jennifer, \\"The Federal Public Service Modernization Act: State of the Art Innovations in Conflict Management,\\" Canadian Government Executive, February 2004, p. 27 * Lynch, Jennifer \\"Integrated Conflict Management Systems Emerge as an Organization Development Strategy\\" \\"Alternatives to the High Costs of Litigation\\", C.P.R. vol. 21 no.

Fleck (born 1973) was a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 81st legislative district. He was first elected in 2006 to succeed the retiring Larry Sather, taking office on January 2, 2007. On December 1, 2012, Fleck came out as gay. After his public announcement, he and Rep. Brian Sims (D - 182) became the two first openly gay state legislators in Pennsylvania. Fleck was the only out Republican legislator in the United States at the time. His coming-out announcement was ranked as one of \\"2012's Top Coming Out Stories\\" along with those of journalist Anderson Cooper, actor Matt Bomer and Good Morning Americas Sam Champion. Mike Fleck ran unopposed until 2014 when fellow Republican and write-in candidate Richard Irvin defeated him in the Republican primary election. Fleck narrowly won the Democratic nomination as a write-in candidate, but lost to Irvin in the general election. The 2014 election was one of the most followed legislative races in the country, with Fleck being profiled in the New York Times and Governing Magazine naming him as one of the \\"Top 12 Legislators to Watch in 2014.\\" In December 2014, Fleck was appointed to newly elected Governor Tom Wolf's transition committee. In June 2015, Fleck joined the Wolf Administration as the Director of the Bureau of Workforce Partnerships and Operations, with the Department of Labor and Industry, overseeing the state's 67 Careerlink Sites. ==Early life== Fleck attended Southern Huntingdon County High School and earned a degree in history and a minor in youth ministry in 1995 from Liberty University. He has attended graduate courses at Shippensburg University. From 1999 to 2004 he worked as a district executive for the Boy Scouts of America in Huntingdon County. Prior to elective office, Fleck worked for Raystown Developmental Services. == Legislative record == Fleck was viewed as being a moderate Republican. One of Fleck's main priorities was Charter School Reform. Fleck also fought Republican Governor Tom Corbett's proposal to privatizing prison nurses. Corbett eventually dropped the proposal. In 2012, Fleck introduced a \\"Correction's Officer's Bill of Rights\\". In 2012, Fleck's legislation to merge the Securities Commission into the Department of Banking was passed, creating the Department of Banking and Securities. == 2014 re- election campaign == In late September 2013, Fleck kicked off his re-election bid. Frank Bruni profiled Mike Fleck in the Sunday New York Times on September 29, 2013. On November 14, 2013, Huntingdon County Treasurer Rich Irvin announced he was running against Fleck; Irvin stated \\"I am not going to accept money from special interest groups, my campaign is going to be funded from within the district boundaries ‚Ä¶ I do not want to run any kind of negative campaign.\\" Meanwhile, Fleck was criticized for raising money during the annual Pennsylvania Society weekend in New York City, whereupon prominent Manhattan Democratic power couple Victor and Betsy Gotbaum hosted a fundraiser for Fleck in their home. Betsy Gotbaum was the former New York City Public Advocate, and Victor Gotbaum was the executive director of DC 37, the largest and wealthiest union in the country; the Gotbaum's are close friends of Fleck and his partner Warren Licht. Fleck told the Altoona Mirror, \\"People know that we don't differ on the fundamental issues the district is facing and that at the end of the day, he was simply recruited to run against me because I announced that I was gay\\". In April 2014, Rich Irvin was kicked off the ballot for failing to file a Financial Statement of Ethics. Irvin waged an aggressive write-in campaign, going as far as to engage local churches to distribute campaign material from the anti-gay group the American Family Association. Irvin told the Altoona Mirror. \\"I absolutely do believe that I had support from different church organizations throughout the district. I'm proud of it.\\" On May 20, 2014, Irvin beat Fleck on the republican ballot, however, Fleck managed to win the write-in on the democratic ballot by 15 votes. The day after the election Fleck stated \\"I am gay. I don't wear it on my sleeve, it doesn't define who I am, and quite frankly it's the least interesting part about me ‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, I knew that when I came out this race would be nothing more, nothing less than whether my constituency could wrap their mind around the fact that I was a gay man. People fear that which is different.\\" State Senator John Eichelberger told the Altoona Mirror \\"A lot of people thought that Mike was a homosexual\\" before 2012, and it wasn't an issue, Eichelberger said. \\"He didn't announce it and it was OK. The feeling from many people is, he put them in a very uncomfortable position. If he had just gone about his business and people thought he was a homosexual or heterosexual or whatever, there wouldn't be a problem.\\"[34] Eichelberger's confirmation that the race was about Fleck being gay and not his politics was picked up by the national media. Senator Eichelberger's district encompasses Fleck's legislative district, Eichelberger is known for his anti-gay views. Irvin later acknowledge there were negative attacks against Fleck because of his sexual orientation. The negative attacks against Fleck's sexual orientation continued throughout the fall campaign. In October 2014, Huntingdon County Republican Committeeman Tom Ritchey posted a crude sex drawing depicting two men having sex and compared it to Fleck. Fleck lost to Irvin in the general election in November 2014. ==Personal life= Fleck's current partner, Dr. Warren Licht, is a prominent New York City physician; in April 2016 he was named one of the top 50 over 50 in New York City. Licht is the former Chief Medical Officer of New York Downtown Hospital. New York Downtown Hospital was a few blocks from the World Trade Center; on Sept. 11th Dr. Licht took a leading role in managing the medical response. Licht is frequently quoted in the press on medical issues. Fleck came out as a gay man on December 1, 2012. He and Democratic Rep. Brian Sims share the designation of the first openly gay members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. However, most media outlets recognize Fleck as the first openly gay legislator as Sims wasn't sworn into office yet. Fleck was one of just two openly gay Republican state legislators in the United States, alongside Ohio state representative Tim Brown, who was sworn into office a month later. == Awards == Huntingdon County Preservation Award (Huntingdon County Historical Society), 1995 Top 20 Under 40\\" in 2013 by the Altoona Mirror Bob O'Connor Leadership Award, Junior Achievement of Western Pennsylvania, 2008 Tom Zuber Award Service Employees International Union Healthcare Pennsylvania (SEIU HCPA) 2012 Vigil Honor, Order of the Arrow (Monaken Lodge), 2000 Keystone Award, Pennsylvania Student Equality Coalition, 2013 Pennsylvania's \\"Foremost Under 40\\" by the Pennsylvania Business Central Richard Crawford Award, Saint Francis Small Business Development Center, 2011 == References  *Pennsylvania House of Representatives - Mike Fleck official PA House website retrieved *Pennsylvania House Republican Caucus - Representative Mike Fleck official Party website retrieved Category:Liberty University alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:People from Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania Category:Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT state legislators in Pennsylvania Category:LGBT Christians Category:1973 births Category:21st- century American politicians ","title":"Mike Fleck"},{"id":"19347270","text":"Union Station served the residents of Chatham, New York, from 1887 to 1972 as a passenger station and until 1976 as a freight station. It was the final stop for Harlem Line trains. It had originally served trains of the Boston and Albany Railroad, then the New York Central Railroad and the Rutland Railway. It served as a junction for service that radiated to Rensselaer, New York, on the northwest, Hudson, New York, to the southwest, northeast in southwestern Vermont and Pittsfield, Massachusetts and New York City to the south. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and currently serves as a branch office of the National Union Bank of Kinderhook. Though it no longer serves as a train station, the rail line alongside it is still a very-active mainline for freight rail. ==History== Before the station house was built rail service to Chatham started on December 21, 1841, when the first portion of the Albany and West Stockbridge Railroad was put into service between Greenbush (east of Albany) and Chatham. The Harlem Extension of the New York and Harlem Railroad was built to Chatham by 1869. By late 1870 a series of company mergers led to the formation of the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A;). In 1881 the B&A; hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design several stations for the railroad. Richardson died unexpectedly in 1886 and the remaining station design work was transferred to the Boston-based architecture firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. They designed the Chatham Station which was opened for service along the B&A;'s Boston to Albany line in 1887. The Richardsonian Romanesque building features a Dutch gable roof with wide eaves and colonnade porticos that extend out east and west along the tracks over the low platform. The walls are made of lightly colored rusticated stone with window and door frames, sills, and lintels of contrasting brownstone. A prominent bow window faces trackside and once was used as part of the stationmaster's office. The New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) took over the B&A; in 1900. The station house was originally staffed by a ticket agent, but the ticket office was closed by the NYCRR in 1960. It remained as an active station for passenger service until March 20, 1972. Under the aegis of Conrail, the station was closed in March 1976 when freight operations from Ghent to Millerton were terminated. Conrail utilized the station for storage in the mid-1970s. In 1977, the freight railroad attempted to sell the station and surrounding land for $85,000. Long distance passenger service on the Rutland Railroad to Chatham ended by 1931 as the company diverted its Rutland/NYC Montreal‚ÄìNew York City trains Green Mountain Flyer and Mount Royal over to the New York Central's Hudson Line.https://www.american- rails.com/chatham.html Tracks north to North Bennington, Vermont were dismantled shortly after 1953. The removal of the NYCRR's Harlem Line trackage south of Church Street followed 30 years later. Boston and Albany Railroad trackage remains in place and is currently used by CSX Transportation. The line was single-tracked by Conrail in the late 1980s. Chatham Union Station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 1, 1974.Columbia County Listings on the National Register of Historic Places In addition to active freight service, Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited long-distance train passes through Chatham without stopping. The station house was renovated and reopened in 1999 to serve as a branch of the National Union Bank of Kinderhook. Currently, the Harlem Valley Rail Trail Association has plans to extend the trail along the right-of-way in front of the site of the former station.Harlem Valley Rail Trail map As of September 2016, $3.5M was appropriated to the HVRT association in Dutchess & Columbia counties to complete this project.http://patch.com/new-york/midhudsonvalley/3-5m-awarded- dutchess-county-harlem-valley-rail-trail Once completed, the HVRT will contain 46 contiguous miles of path. ==See also== * Union Station (disambiguation) ==References * *Chatham, Former Terminus of the Harlem Division, Photos Then and Now Category:Defunct railway stations in New York (state) Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1887 Category:Railway stations closed in 1972 Category:Railway stations closed in 1976 Chatham, New York Category:Rutland Railroad Chatham, New York Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Railway stations in Columbia County, New York Category:Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia County, New York Category:1887 establishments in New York (state) Category:1972 disestablishments in New York (state) ","title":"Union Station (Chatham, New York)"},{"id":"19347278","text":"Charlie Fellows (born 26 April 1988)Charlie Fellows player profile Scrum.com is an English rugby union player for Stourbridge in National League 1.

He was well known for his charitable works outside of university life holding governorships of several schools and his association with British hospitals especially the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. ==Early life== George was the second son of Rev. Christopher Cronshaw, Canon of Manchester Cathedral. Raised in Lancashire, which now includes parts of Greater Manchester, he attended Manchester Grammar School and went up to Queen's College, Oxford as a Berry exhibitioner where he graduated with a first class in Chemistry. Leaving Oxford, he attended Leeds Clergy School and was subsequently ordained into a curacy in Holbeck, Leeds.The Times (1928a) ==Oxford career== George Cronshaw returned to Oxford in 1898 as Chaplain at his old college, Queen's whilst holding a curacy at St Cross Church, Holywell. He remained chaplain for thirty years during which time he strongly supported the college music society and choir. In 1900, resigned his curacy and was appointed lecturer in Chemistry, whereupon he organised the college chemistry laboratory in Queen's Lane. In May 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the college, and in 1905 became Junior Bursar rising to Senior Bursar in 1912 at which time he relinquished all teaching responsibilities. Outside of the college he was Junior Proctor for the University from 1909 to 1910 and served as a member of the Hebdomadal Council from 1911 until 1923. In addition, he acted as Visitor to the Museum, Acting Curator of the Schools and a member of the Boards of Natural History and Medicine. He was also chairman and secretary of the Committee of College Bursars. As treasurer of St Hugh's College, Oxford he oversaw their move to the current premises in Banbury Road ==Schools and hospitals== Outside of university he was a member of the governing bodies of King Edward VI School, Southampton and both Heversham and Keswick Schools. He was chairman of governors for St. Bees School. From 1910 to 1928 he was chairman and treasurer of the committee for the Radcliffe Infirmary whilst being a member of the committee of the British Hospital Association. At the Radcliffe, he helped to establish the throat and ear, maternity and electrical departments. He helped to obtain for the hospital the Headington Manor House and Children's Convalescent Home in Cowley and established a countywide contributory scheme that put the hospital on a sound financial footing. It was for such achievements that the Oxford City Council recommended that the freedom of the City be conferred upon him. ==Church and freemasonry== In church life, he undertook the duties of examining chaplain to a number of dioceses: to the Bishop of Chichester from 1919 to 1921 and from 1921 to the Bishop of Carlisle.The Times (1928b) It was observed that he would often cycle 10 or 20 miles out of Oxford on a Sunday to preach or take service in a county parish. He married late in life (1925) to Dorothy Wardle of Scarthwaite near Lancaster, Lancashire; they had no children. An active freemason, Cronshaw was three times Master of the Apollo University Lodge, Grand Senior Warden of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Oxfordshire and Grand Chaplain in the Grand Lodge of England. ==St Edmund Hall== George Cronshaw's continuous hard work took its toll on his health and after a bout of influenza in 1928 he was offered, in May of that year, the position of Principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford which at that time still had close ties to Queen's College. In accepting the position, upon the retirement of G.B. Allan, he agreed to give up all his other duties and appointments. However, it was too late to save his health; he took to his bed ill, weeks after his appointment, and he died in his residence at the Hall on 20 December. He was succeeded as Principal by A.B. Emden who had himself only recently been appointed to Vice-Principal.The Times (1929) ==NotesReferences== *The Times (1928a) \\"Rev. G. B. Cronshaw.

McGowan. Produced by Hal Roach and released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was the 88th release in the Our Gang series. ==Plot== The gang is playing around the railroad station, and Joe and Chubby's father, an engineer, lectures against the kids playing in such a dangerous area. True to his word, after Joe and Chubby's father leaves, a crazy man starts a train with most of the kids on it, save for Farina who is nearly run over several times. Once Farina manages to climb aboard himself, the kids attempt to stop the runaway locomotive, but have no luck until the engine crashes into a grocery truck. As it turns out, however, the entire incident is revealed to be a dream Farina had as Joe and Chubby's father lectured the kids about rail-yard safety. ==Production notes== Railroadin' is a partial remake of The Sun Down Limited. The film marked the first appearance of Norman Chaney as \\"Chubby\\", having won a national contest to replace Joe Cobb as the Our Gang \\"fat kid\\". ==Lost soundtrack== Like many early sound films, Railroadin' was recorded using a sound-on-disc synchronization process - the soundtracks for the film were held on separate phonographic records, which would be played by a projectionist in synch with the film. The sound discs for the film went missing at MGM in the 1940s, and only the film negative survived. When MGM sold Roach the catalog of Our Gang films made at the Roach studio, it therefore acquired only the picture element of Railroadin'; as such, the short was never included in any of the Little Rascals theatrical reissue or television distribution packages. Home movie distributor Blackhawk Films produced a silent film adaption of Railroadin' with text titles in the 1970s, leading to the film's first release in any form since its original theatrical release. In 1982, the long-lost sound discs for Railroadin' were located in an MGM vault, and the film was finally made available with sound for the first time in decades via a 1983 VHS release by Blackhawk. Railroadin' has since been released on DVD as well, but was never added into the Little Rascals television package, despite being restored to sound. ==Cast== The Gang * Norman Chaney as Chubby * Joe Cobb as Joe * Jean Darling as Jean * Allen Hoskins as Farina * Bobby Hutchins as Wheezer * Mary Ann Jackson as Mary Ann * Harry Spear as Harry * Pete the Pup as Himself Additional cast * Ed Brandenburg as Bob, the brakeman * Mrs. Norman T.

Her work included the performances of kritis by Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar and in the years after Indian independence, she helped popularise the famous mystic poet of Tamil Nadu, Kavi Yogi Maharishi Dr. Shuddhananda Bharati's songs. She died of tuberculosis in 1951. ==Early life== NCV was born as Kamakshi in Irinjalakkuda, Cochin State of British India, the present Kerala. Her family then shifted to Nagapattinam. Her father, Chandrashekhara Iyer sent her under the tutelage of Nagapattinam 'Jalra' Gopala Iyer, an accompanist in Harikatha performances. In 1936, the family moved to Madras, where she started giving concerts. She won the first prize in vocal music at the Madras Music Academy annual conference of 1938, which was presided over by Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar and declared open by the Yuvaraja of Mysore. ==Her Music== Her voice was melodious with perfect intonation, sruti, emotion, high-pitched and clear pronunciation of words. Her rendering of higher octaves and sruti were remarkably with effortless ease to bring off brigas. She sang plenty of Tamil songs. She was a regular performer at the festivals of the Tamil Isai Sangam in Madras and Nellai Sangeetha Sabha in Thirunelveli. She also performed for the Tyagaraja Aradhana each year between 1942 and 1951. NCV ranked among the top performers of the classical singer of that time and many records were released containing her classical and semi-classical songs. The famous Carnatic music vocalist Tiger Varadachariar had bestowed upon her the title \\"Madhurageetha Vani\\". Some of her famous songs are: * yen paLLi koNdeer ayyaa * thanthai thaai irundhaal umakkindha * nitiraiyil vandhu nenjil idam * mahalakshmi jaganmatha * aanandha nadanam aadinAL * aasai koNdEn vaNdE * thithikkum senthamizhaal dEsaabhimaanam enum * andha naaL ini varumO * varuvaanO vanakkuyilE * aadu raattE * saarasa dala nayana * indha varam tharuvaan * needayarada Film Songs She also sang the following songs for the Tamil film industry, which became very popular.

She started with Chandraguptha Chanakya (1940) playing the role of the princess Chaaya directed by C. K. Saachi in 1940. Followed by Venuganan (1940), Gangavathar (1942), Haridas (1944), Valmiki (1946), Kundalakesi (1946) and Krishna Vijayam (1950). Today, not many of her Carnatic renditions are available as CDs or audio recordings and those which are available contain both cinema and Carnatic compositions, mostly from various concerts she had given in the past. ==Personal life== Her personal life was an unhappy one. Her marriage had been a failure as her husband was not inclined to encourage her music pursuits. In later years, she found a life-partner in a lawyer turned film-maker, C. K. Sathasivan (known as C. K. Saachi) till her last days. She fell victim to a severe attack of tuberculosis, and died in 1951 at her residence in Gopalapuram, Madras. She was only thirty-two years old at the time of her death and the classical music world lost a singer with a dulcet voice. ==References== * * * A SPRING IN MEMORY:THE VASANTHAKOKILAM CONNECTION Monday, 3 February 2014 ==External links== * - Song by NCV in the film Gangavathar Category:Female Carnatic singers Category:Carnatic singers Category:Performers of Hindu music Category:Indian female film singers Category:Malayalam playback singers Category:Tamil playback singers Category:Tamil singers Category:1919 births Category:1951 deaths Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:20th-century Indian singers Category:Singers from Kerala Category:Film musicians from Kerala Category:People from Irinjalakuda Category:Women musicians from Kerala Category:20th-century Indian women singers Category:Tuberculosis deaths in India ","title":"N.

(Some sources say 1982, or 1984.) In 1990 she was commissioned by Mary Robinson, the first female president of Ireland, to design a purple moir√© outfit for her presidential inauguration. Robinson subsequently became a regular customer, wearing Louise Kennedy outfits through her term in office and afterwards. Kennedy stated that she had been very fortunate by the timing of this, as it drew a great deal of attention and media coverage with many Irish clients suddenly made aware of her work and choosing to buy from her. That same year she was chosen to exhibit at the London Designer Show. In the mid-90s she joined the British Fashion Council, showing her collections at London Fashion Week twice a year. She opened her flagship stores in Dublin (at 56 Merrion Square) and London in 1997, the same year in which she designed uniforms for flight staff on Aer Lingus. Since 1999 she has also designed glassware for Tipperary Crystal, collaborating with Marcus Notley since 2001. In 2009, she designed new judge's robes for the Irish Law Courts, marking a break from the traditional British robes that previous judges had worn. In 2011 Kennedy started offering bespoke wedding dresses. In 2013, the 30th anniversary of her company, she launched a range of personalised designer handbags, produced in collaboration with the British luxury leather goods company Tanner Krolle. In April 2014, Kennedy was among the Irish designers chosen to create the wardrobe for Irish President Michael D. Higgins's wife Sabina for their state visit to London. The outfits, apart from two custom-made ball gowns for state banquets, one by Kennedy and the other by Jill Howard, were bought as ready-to-wear, and chosen by Sabina with the assistance of her friend, the film and theatrical costume designer Joan Bergin, in order to showcase the best of Irish design, with Bergin saying \\"It was not my intention to commission a special wardrobe, but to show Irish women what was on offer out there.\\" The outfits were widely acclaimed in the Irish press, with the Irish Independent dedicating an article to the fact that Sabina wore three separate Kennedy ensembles in one day. Alongside Sabina Higgins and Mary Robinson, Kennedy has also dressed the British Prime Ministers' wives Cherie Blair and Sarah Brown. In 1998, she replaced Ronit Zilkha as Cherie Blair's favourite designer. Other clients include Sophie, Countess of Wessex, Meryl Streep, Kirsty Young, and Enya. In December 2014 Kennedy joined a group of mainly British designers, artists and businesspeople (including David Bailey, Roja Dove and Stella McCartney) at 10 Downing Street to mark their roles as ambassadors for David Cameron's GREAT Britain campaign, which was designed to promote the United Kingdom as a tourist destination, a place for study, or somewhere to do business. ==Awards== Kennedy was named Irish Designer of the Year award in 1989 and 1990. She won a Fashion Oscar in 1992 for the Best Irish Designer Collection and in 1994 was the first female designer to receive an award for Outstanding Achievements in Fashion from the Irish Clothing Industry. For her achievements in Irish fashion she was elected Tipperary Person of the Year in 1992. She has also been named Veuve Cliquot's Irish Businesswoman of the Year for 2003 and 2004. In 2009 she became the first woman to act as style envoy for Mercedes-Benz. In 2014, The Irish Post gave Louise Kennedy a Company of the Year award. Throughout her career Kennedy has been recognised for her suit and coat designs, winning awards specifically for these in 1985 (Best Irish Coat Collection), 1991 (Best Suit and Best Coat Award), and 1993 (Best Coat and Suit Collection Designer of the Year). In November 2014 Kennedy was awarded an honorary PhD from her former university, the Dublin Institute of Technology, in recognition of her commercial and cultural success. On Saturday 21 November 2017, Kennedy was awarded an honorary fellowship by the Royal College Of Physicians of Ireland which is the highest honour bestowed by RCPI. This award is reserved for world leaders in medical science and those who have made an exceptional contribution to society. ==In popular culture== In 2010 Kennedy was one of six contemporary, internationally renowned Irish fashion designers featured on a set of Irish postage stamps issued by An Post. The other designers featured were Paul Costelloe, Lainey Keogh, John Rocha, Philip Treacy and Orla Kiely. Along with Costelloe she was a celebrity guest judge for the 2013 final of RT√â Television's Craft Master show. ==References== Category:Irish fashion designers Category:1960 births Category:20th-century Irish people Category:21st-century Irish people Category:Living people Category:People from County Tipperary Category:Women fashion designers ","title":"Louise Kennedy"},{"id":"19347420","text":"Rostislav Vsevolodovich () (c. 1070‚Äì1093) was the Prince of Pereyaslavl (1078‚Äì1093), son of Vsevolod I of Kiev, and half brother of Vladimir Monomakh.

Qubain, 1979, , p206 In the seventh year of the reign of King John, Marc was given the bailiwick of Burton. In 1214, Marc had a deputy named Eustace of Lowdham who may have already been working for him for five years. Like Marc himself, Eustace has been proposed as a contender for the Sheriff of Nottingham mentioned in the Robin Hood legends. However, there was no \\"Sheriff of Nottingham\\" until much later. Marc was the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire and the Royal Forests and Eustace was his deputy. Marc was not popular; he and his relatives have been judged a \\"bad lot\\". He and his relatives are specifically mentioned in the Magna Carta. At Runnymede, King John agreed to many clauses, but clause 50 specifically calls for the end of Marc. During the rebellion, Eustace of Lowdham did not take the side of the King, but rather that of John de Lacy; in 1216 both the deputy and Marc made their peace with King John. On 18 October 1216, Marc was named in the unusual appointment of Nicola de la Haye, as joint Sheriff of Lincolnshire. It is thought that following the rebellions, loyalty was so rare that the unlikely appointment of a woman was made at the end of the King's life.English Government in the Thirteenth Century, Adrian Jobson Marc still held the post of Sheriff until he was replaced on 28 December 1217 by Ralph FitzNicholas, but it is thought that his role may have been actually carried out by Eustace as it was he who presents the accounts each year.

In 1234, Brian de Lisle granted a pension to Ann, Philip's widow. ==In popular culture== A sympathetic portrayal of Marc as the Sheriff was presented in the Richard Kluger novel \\"The Sheriff of Nottingham\\". In this version Marc is portrayed as a good man who has to make hard choices in a thankless job. Another, more villainous, version of Marc directly fought Robin Hood in the short story \\"The Walnut-Hued Man of Sutton Passeys\\" by Jean Rabe, part of the anthology \\"Warrior Fantastic\\". Eustace of Lowdham also makes an appearance as Marc's deputy. A 1985 episode of the television drama Robin of Sherwood (entitled \\"The Sheriff of Nottingham\\", written by Anthony Horowitz) introduces \\"Philip Mark\\" as one of King John's enforcers. Marc is portrayed as a former sheriff of Lincolnshire, whose ruthlessness in completing his duties earned him a nickname: \\"the Butcher of Lincoln.\\" As King John has grown tired of failures to capture Robin Hood by the series' fictional sheriff character, Robert de Rainault, Marc is appointed as his replacement. This version of Marc is portrayed as having a Saracen bodyguard named Sarak, and it is implied that Marc may have been active in the East during the Crusades. The character \\"Philip Mark\\" does not survive the end of the episode, and Robert de Rainault is restored to his role as sheriff. \\"Philip Mark\\" was played by Lewis Collins. ==References== Category:12th-century births Category:13th-century deaths Category:People from Nottinghamshire Category:High Sheriffs of Nottinghamshire Category:High Sheriffs of Derbyshire Category:High Sheriffs of Lincolnshire ","title":"Philip Marc"},{"id":"19347467","text":"The Grand synagogue of Aden ( Al-Milama‚Äôl-kabira), also known as Shield of Avraham Synagogue or \\"Magen Avraham\\", was built in 1858. The synagogue was founded in 1860 by Menahem Messa. It was large enough to house over 2,000 worshipers. The pulpit was made of marble ‚Äì pure, white and polished, with 7 marble steps leading up to it. The floor was made of marble sections, patterned black and white as on a chess board. The ark was built into the wall pile or stack, and covered by six curtains woven with silk and interwoven with gleaming sapphires, above them the crowns of the torah. The torah scrolls were adorned with crowns and pomegranates, some of them gold, and some of them pure refined silver. The two tablets of the 10 commandments on both sides of the doors were made of polished silver. The huge ceiling was supported by eight wooden columns, four on each side. Each column had a radius of 80 inches and were 40 feet high. The ceiling and the numerous windows are replete with stained glass in blazing colour and dozens of lanterns. Along the Eastern wall was a women‚Äôs section with 200 places. The entrance to the synagogue was through a huge courtyard which also served as a place of worship on Sabbath and the high holy days. A mikvah was also built on the southern side of the synagogue. ==See also== * History of the Jews in Aden * Jews of Hadramaut * Habbani Jews * History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula * Jewish exodus from Arab lands * Yemenite Jews ==References== *Professor Reuben Ahroni *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndbhdnwQFg *https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kraut/Family_Photos/pages/Aden/Aden.shtml *\\"West of Aden\\", Yacov Tobi Category:Jewish Yemeni history Category:Yemenite Jews Category:History of the Jews in the Middle East Category:Destroyed synagogues Category:Orthodox synagogues Category:Synagogues completed in 1858 Category:Synagogues in Yemen Category:Buildings and structures in Aden Category:Orthodox Judaism in the Arab world Category:Orthodox Judaism in the Middle East ","title":"Grand Synagogue of Aden"},{"id":"19347479","text":"Boechera stricta (syn.

He played professionally in the Football League for York City and Lincoln City and in the Scottish Football League for Clyde. ==Career== Wilford began his career as a centre-half for Middlesbrough, signing for the club from Harrogate College in the summer of 1999. In September 2001 he joined Scarborough on loan, making his debut in the 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Hayes on 8 September 2001 and going on to spend two months with the Seasiders. Returning to Boro, he was one of four youngsters, the others being Steve Baker, Gerard Robinson and Paul Stephenson, released by manager Steve McClaren at the end of November 2001. Wilford signed for Whitby Town from Malton, debuting against Bradford Park Avenue on 9 January 2002. He remained with the club until September 2003 when he joined York City, scoring on his Football League debut just three minutes after coming on as a substitute in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Rochdale on 6 September 2003. In December 2003 he joined Worksop Town on loan for a month. In February, he joined Harrogate Town on loan, debuting in the 0‚Äì0 draw at Frickley Athletic on 14 February 2004. His contract with York was cancelled by mutual consent in March 2004 and he swiftly joined Lincoln City. Whitby Town and Blyth Spartans In March 2007 he asked to leave Whitby and manager Lee Nogan agreed to his request. He linked up with his former Whitby manager Harry Dunn at Blyth Spartans, debuting in the 2‚Äì0 Football Conference North home victory over Worksop Town on 10 March 2007. He played in ten of the clubs' remaining eleven league fixtures scoring three goals, his first in the 2‚Äì0 victory at Barrow on 31 March 2007 and his final goal in the closing league game of the season a 3‚Äì1 home victory over Hinckley United on 28 April 2007, as the Spartans narrowly missed out on the end of season play-offs finishing in seventh place in their inaugural Conference North campaign. Guiseley Wilford trained with Guiseley during the summer of 2007 before agreeing a deal to link up with his former York City manager Terry Dolan at the club, debuting in the 3‚Äì2 Northern Premier League away victory over Stamford on 18 August 2007. Although Guiseley started the season well Dolan was surprisingly sacked in November, with Steve Kittrick appointed in his place leading to a large overhaul in the squad. Although Wilford won the club's fair play award at the end of the season he was one of six players to depart the club following Kittrick's decision to restructure the budget. Australia Wilford moved to Australia, joining Southern Stars during the 2008 Victorian State League Division 1 season before moving to Victorian Premier League side Dandenong Thunder for the 2009 season. In October 2010, he decided not to renew his contract with Dandenong Thunder instead moving to Bentleigh Greens for the 2011 Victorian Premier League season. ==See also== *Clyde F.C. season 2004-05 ==References * *Lincoln City F.C.

In January 1979, he was signed by Football League Second Division-side Preston North End for ¬£3,000. He waited two years to replace first-choice goalkeeper Roy Tunks for his Preston debut, which came on 28 February 1981 against Chelsea, keeping a clean sheet in a 1‚Äì0 victory and earning The Sun newspaper's man of the match award. His prize was a ¬£1,000 charity cheque, which he donated to a motor neurone disease cause, in memory of former Preston player Mel Holden, who had died from the disease. He made another two appearances in the Second Division, as the club were relegated in the 1980‚Äì81 season, and went on to play a total of 107 league appearances with Preston, winning the club's player of the year in the 1983‚Äì84 season.

He was part of the Democratic leadership, majority leader in 1972, and helped establish California's occupational health and safety regime. ==Personal== His parents were Lithuanian immigrants. His father operated a delicatessen. He earned a degree in 1939 from what was then called Brockport State Normal School, and later studied at University of California, Berkeley. He was drafted into the United States Army in 1941, and served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. After his discharge, he entered Loyola Law School in 1945, and was graduated in 1949. Also in 1945, he married Betty Byer who subsequently bore him four children. He established a law practice in Montebello, California in 1949. Mr. Fenton belonged to many organizations, including the Optimist Club, American Legion and Rotary Club. He received the George Moscone Memorial Award for Outstanding Public Service in 1978, from an association of consumer lawyers in Los Angeles. He was appointed a member of the Judicial Council of California in 1979. ==Political career== When John Moreno, the first term Mexican American Assemblyman for the 51st District sought reelection, he faced both Dionisio Morales and Jack Fenton. With the chicano vote split, Fenton won the party's nomination in the primary election. He carried the general election with 69% of the vote. He continued to represent Montebello, reelected to seven more two year terms (from 1974, in the 59th Assembly District.) In the legislature, Fenton championed consumers, veterans, and labor (including farm workers.) After Jess Unruh declared his candidacy for Governor in 1969, Fenton and Assemblyman George N. Zenovich encouraged Unruh (at first unsuccessfully) to resign as party leader in the Assembly. Following an industrial accident on June 24, 1971, when a methane gas explosion fatal to seventeen workers occurred in the California Water Project's Sylmar tunnel, Fenton led the investigation in the Assembly's Committee on Industrial Safety. His investigation, and civil litigation, found negligence by the contractor (Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company) and state inspectors. He was a leader promoting statutory change, notably the June 1973 California Occupational Safety and Health Act. Hospitals and staff threatened to cease organ transplantation activity in 1973 when its legal basis came into question. Criminal defense attorneys argued that harvesting a victim's organs while his heart was still beating caused death, not their clients. Dixon Arnett (R-Redwood City) introduced emergency legislation to recognize death when brain activity ceased. He was three votes short of the required supermajority when he enlisted Jack Fenton, who secured favorable action from two more members. After the California State Senate passed the bill, Arnett flew to Chicago to secure Governor Ronald Reagan's signature giving force to the law. From 1977-1980 he was chairman of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee. Earlier, he had been chairman of the Assembly's Finance and Insurance Committee. Fenton lost his primary election in 1980 to Matthew G. Mart√≠nez. Art Torres was a prot√©g√© and Republican Assemblyman Robert Hayden (of Santa Clara's 22nd district) was a friend. ==References== Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:California Democrats Category:1916 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:People from Montebello, California Category:Jewish American state legislators in California Category:Politicians from Rochester, New York Category:Loyola Law School alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:State University of New York at Brockport alumni Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Lawyers from Rochester, New York ","title":"Jack R.

In 1674 he became a bencher at Inner Temple, and was the leading practitioner on the western circuit, frequently pleading at the King's Bench. In 1676 he defended Stockbridge, Hampshire on a Quo warranto charge, which he lost. He frequently acted as counsel in various politically charged cases, and regularly lost; clients included the lords involved in the Popish Plot, the Earl of Danby and as one of many counsel for Edward Fitzharris, Stephen College and Algernon Sidney, all of whom were later executed. Along with Sir George Treby and Sir Francis Winnington he defended London on a second Quo warranto charge in 1683, arguing that Corporations could not be charged for the wrongdoing of individuals. He lost, and in 1684 was asked to take a similar case for Berwick-upon-Tweed, this time advising surrender. In 1688 he was made a justice, and advised the House of Lords on the legality of Quo warranto seizures. After William III arrived in 1688 he was a close advisor, and helped persuade him to declare himself King, arguing that the throne was vacant due to James fleeing, saying James ‚Äòwent away because the terror of his own conscience frighted him and he durst stay no longer‚Äô.Oxford DNB: Pollexcfen, Sir Henry William did not make himself King according to Pollexfen's advice, but in reward for his services Pollexfen was knighted and made Attorney General for England and Wales in March, and appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas on 6 May 1689.

The following year, his family lived in Vienna, where his father, Dr. Rowland Hill Mackenzie, was assistant surgeon in the midwifery department at Imperial Hospital. When Dr. Mackenzie and his wife returned to England around 1840, Kenneth remained in Vienna for his education, excelling in languages (German, French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew). At 17, he was back in London, where he worked in the publishing office of Benjamin Disraeli. ==Literary career== In 1851, when Mackenzie was just 18, his short introductory biography of Homer, a translation of a text by Herodotus, appeared in Theodore Alois Buckley‚Äôs The Odyssey of Homer, with the Hymns, Epigrams, and Battles of the Frogs and Mice. Literally Translated, with Explanatory Notes (London: Henry Bohn). At the beginning of the book, Buckley thanked Mackenzie for his Life of Homer: Attributed to Herodotus, writing, For the translation of the Pseudo-Herodotean Life of Homer, the reader is indebted to the industry of Kenneth Mackenzie, Esq. It is the earliest memoir of the supposed author of the Iliad we possess. (\\"Care and an excellent education seconding the happy talents with which nature had endowed him, [he] soon surpassed his school fellows in every attainment,\\" Mackenzie wrote of the young Homer. \\"[W]hen older, he... taught in the school of Phemius, where every one applauded him.\\") In 1852, the year of publication of his translation, from German, of Karl Richard Lepsius‚Äô Briefe aus Aegypten, Aethiopen (Discoveries in Egypt, Ethiopia and the Peninsula of Sinai), Mackenzie also translated, from Danish, Hans Christian Andersen‚Äôs In Sweden (published in the book The Story of My Life; and In Sweden). For T. A. Buckley‚Äôs 1852 book Great Cities of the Ancient World, Mackenzie supplied the chapters on Peking, America, and Scandinavia. In Buckley's Great Cities of the Middle Ages (Routledge, 1853), the author thanked \\"my literary friend and coadjutor, Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie\\" for contributing the chapters on the cities of Spain. In Buckley's The Dawnings of Distinguished Men (Routledge, 1853), the author acknowledged \\"I am again a grateful debtor to the kindness of my friend Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, Esq., whose Memoir of Thomas Chatterton forms one of its most interesting chapters.\\" (\\"As his taste differed from that of children of his age, his dispositions were also different,\\" Mackenzie, 19, wrote of the dreamy 18th century romantic poet and document forger who had committed suicide in London at the age of 18. \\"Instead of the thoughtless levity of childhood he possessed the gravity, pensiveness, and melancholy of mature life.... some dark, doubtful ideas of the great Life had presented themselves, and his spirit was grappling with them in hard strife.\\") In 1853, Routledge published Mackenzie‚Äôs book Burmah and the Burmese, even as Mackenzie was busy helping Walter Savage Landor prepare a new edition of his Imaginary Conversations (Demosthenes to Eubulides: \\"We want surprise, as at our theaters; astonishment, as at the mysteries of Eleusis.\\" Diogenes to Plato: \\"It is better to shake our heads and let nothing out of them than to be plain and explicit in matters of difficulty... for if we answer with ease, we may be... liable to the probation of every clown's knuckle.\\") In 1854, Mackenzie translated, from the German, Friedrich Wagner‚Äôs Schamyl and Circassia (the title page noting Mackenzie had already, at age 20, been appointed a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain). (\\"[T]he deeds of this remarkable man [ Imam Shamil ]... have filled his enemies as well as his friends with astonishment and admiration... Civilization such as we have around us now, leads inevitably to heartlessness.\\") In 1855, Mackenzie translated, from the German, J. W. Wolf‚Äôs Fairy Tales Collected in the Odenwald (Routledge). Between October 1858 and January 1859, at his own expense, Mackenzie published four issues of The Biological Review: A Monthly Repertory of the Science of Life. In 1859, Routledge published Master Tyll Owlglass: His Marvellous Adventures and Rare Conceits, Mackenzie‚Äôs translation of the medieval prankster story \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\", published in the U.S. in 1860 by Ticknor & Fields. (\\"[T]he era of its [original] publication was rife with magicians, astrologers, and alchymists... Cornelius Agrippa very shortly afterwards found it necessary to protest against the abuse of such subjects in his treatise 'Of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences and Arts'... Johannes Trithemius was then Abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of Spanheim... but true to its mission of a folkbook, filled with the manners and customs of its time, [this story of ] Owlglass is thoroughly worldly and, for us, therefore, possesses greater interest and value.\\") In 1861, Mackenzie traveled to Paris to meet the French occultist Eliphas Levi (Alphonse Louis Constant). In 1854, Mackenzie had met the American Rosicrucian Paschal Beverly Randolph who, in Paris in 1861, was newly appointed Supreme Grand Master for the Western World of the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis. In 1864, when Robert Wentworth Little found some old Rosicrucian rituals written in German in the storerooms of London‚Äôs Freemason‚Äôs Hall, he immediately turned to Mackenzie to help him whip these up into an esoteric order. Thinking that Mackenzie, a friend of the likes of Paschal Beverly Randolph and Eliphas Levi, had ‚Äì as Mackenzie himself had claimed ‚Äì been initiated into a German Rosicrucian fraternity when he lived in Vienna, Little believed Mackenzie had the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù to found the new, ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù esoteric society. In 1866, with Mackenzie‚Äôs help, Little founded the Rosicrucian Society of England, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. The main leaders of the new organization were Little, William Wynn Westcott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (Westcott, Woodman, and Mathers would later be \\"the founding Chiefs\\" of the \\"Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn\\"). According to a report of The Gentleman's Magazine, in May 1863, Mackenzie read to the Society of Antiquaries of London an \\"interesting paper\\" on \\"the 'History of the Horn book' illustrated by specimens from his own collection and by photographs and woodcuts from other collections.\\" At the time, Mackenzie was preparing for the publication of a book on the subject. The publisher, in advance of the publication, had set in type and printed the title page; only this page was ever printed. As for \\"the paper\\" read before the Society of Antiquaries, The Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine reported, it \\"shewed considerable research, and was listened to with much interest.\\" In 1870 in London, James Hogg & Son published Mackenzie‚Äôs translation of Johann Georg Ludwig Hesekiel‚Äôs Life Of Bismarck (republished in the U.S. in 1877 as Bismarck: His Authentic Biography; Profusely Illustrated by Distinguished Artists, with a new introduction by Bayard Taylor). In 1872, the year of his marriage, seven pages of a manuscript, \\"Zythogala; or, Borne by the Sea: An International Romance of the Nineteenth Century By K. R. H. Mackenzie.

[\\"One of the queerest mixtures to be used as a beverage to be found anywhere is zythogala, a mixture of milk and beer.\\"] Though known as something of an eccentric, \\"one of the most companionable of persons\\" when sober, but mean-spirited and harshly critical when under the influence of ale (in Vienna he had become very fond of both Vienna-style red ale and the beers of Munich, Germany), with no known source of income (apparently he had developed a system of astrological prediction of horse race winners that seemingly never produced any actual winnings), in 1872 Mackenzie married Alexandrina Aydon. In 1873, Mackenzie‚Äôs friend and mentor Frederick Hockley wrote of him, \\"I have the utmost reluctance even to refer to Mr. Kenneth Mackenzie. I made his acquaintance about 15 or 16 years since. I found him then a very young man who having been educated in Germany possessed a thorough knowledge of German and French and his translations having been highly praised by the press, exceedingly desirous of investigating the Occult Sciences, and when sober one of the most companionable persons I ever met.\\" In October 1874, a publisher‚Äôs prospectus was issued for Mackenzie‚Äôs Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia. In mid-August 1875, Mackenzie wrote a friend that ‚Äúwhen this book is finished, I shall, very likely, run over to Canada. My father in law Harrison Aydon is carrying all before him and I am in correspondence with my cousin Alexander Mackenzie the Premier (sic) [of Canada].\\" Mackenzie corrected the last of the Cyclopaedia proofs early in 1877. In 1881, Mackenzie edited the early issues of the Masonic periodical Kneph. He planned a book called The Game of Tarot: Archaeologically and Symbolically Considered, which was announced but not published. Another new order, the \\"Order of Light\\", was launched in 1882, followed by Mackenzie‚Äôs creation of an even more esoteric Masonic organization called the \\"Society of Eight,\\" formed especially \\"for the study of Alchemy.\\" In 1883, John Hogg published The Shoes of Fortune, and Other Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen, \\"with a biographical sketch of Andersen by Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, LLD., original English editor of Andersen's 'In Sweden'.\\" ==Death and posthumously discovered works== Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie died on 3 July 1886, shortly before his fifty-third birthday. In August 1887, the Cipher Manuscripts were bought from Mackenzie‚Äôs wife and transferred, via A. F. A. Woodford, to William Wynn Westcott. Although the Cipher Manuscripts appeared to be in Mackenzie's handwriting,Joscelyn Godwin, The Theosophical Enlightenment, SUNY Press, 1994 Westcott made elaborate claims concerning Mackenzie‚Äôs having received permission to open, in Britain, an order that was said to have originated in Germany, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Cipher Manuscripts were used to found the order. ==References *http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Marvelous-Adventures-and-Rare- Conceits-of-Master-Tyll-Owlglass/Kenneth-R-H-MacKenzie/e/9780548316405 The Marvelous Adventures and Rare Conceits of Master Tyll Owlglass Category:1833 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People from Deptford ","title":"Kenneth R.

He was one of the earliest proponents of teaching African and African-American history in American schools. ==Early life== Huggins was born in Selma, Alabama, but moved to Washington D.C. with his family when he was still young. After university, he moved to Chicago, Illinois where he worked as a high school teacher. During the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, Huggins became involved in the New Negro Movement, writing for a number of pro African-American journals. He also became involved in the \\"Garvey movement\\" to popularise African-American history, along with Arthur Schomburg and John Edward Bruce. In 1924, Huggins moved to New York City to continue his teaching. Black teachers were quite still unusual in the New York public school system, and Huggins' attempts to include African and African-American history within the curriculum were met with strong opposition. Instead, Huggins and other black teachers taught out-of-school classes on African- American history to students. In 1932 he became the first black student to receive a PhD from Fordham University. ==Work== Huggins main goal was to promote the serious study of African and African-American history, which he did as associate director of the Blyden Society. In 1934 he co-wrote A Guide to the Study of African History with John G. Jackson as a prospective guide to teaching African history in schools. The two later wrote An Introduction to African Civilizations with Main Currents in Ethiopian History in 1937. Huggins was also a passionate campaigner for Ethiopia during the Italo-Ethiopian War and during its subsequent occupation by Italy. He became executive director of the International Council of the Friends of Ethiopia and was sent by the American League Against War and Fascism as a special envoy to the League of Nations in Geneva on behalf of Ethiopia, where he argued against Italian fascism and criticised American neutrality.On Huggins. ==Death== Huggins went missing on December 23, 1940. The only clues to his whereabouts were an overcoat that had been found on the George Washington Bridge and a letter that Huggins sent to his wife stating that \\"Something is going to happen.\\" At the time of his disappearance, Huggins was teaching history and economics at Bushwick High School in Brooklyn and serving as Assistant Principal at Harlem's Union High School in the evening. Seven months later, on July 15, 1941, his body was recovered from the Hudson River by police. His death was ruled a suicide by the police, his family, and his lawyer. Despite this, some of his students at the Blyden Society and Harlem community centre voiced concerns that he may have been murdered by gangsters over unpaid business loans. ==See also== *Arthur Schomburg *John G.

Johann Philipp apprenticed in a trading enterprise in Leipzig from 1730 to 1735, then worked in Nantes and later for his uncle Jakob Adami. In 1746 he and his youngest brother Simon Moritz each paid 800 guldens to purchase citizenship in Frankfurt. Their brother Johann Jakob carried on the family name in Bordeaux, where he became a merchant and shipowner. Following the death of their uncle in 1745 the brothers inherited half of his fortune. In 1746 they assumed control of the trading enterprise Jacob Adami, which became the Gebr√ºder Bethmann bank in 1748. In 1762 they purchased the Basler Hof mansion and premises from the Patrizier Johann Friedrich Maximilian von Stalburg, which Johann Philipp expanded with further acquisitions in 1787/88.

The museum educates visitors about the social and industrial history of the site, which operated from 1894‚Äì1998 as a coffin furniture factory. The museum opened in October 2014 after a fifteen-year campaign by the Birmingham Conservation Trust to save the factory building, which ceased trading in 1998, and raise the funds to transform it into a heritage attraction. Located at 13‚Äì15 Fleet Street, the building is Grade II* listed. ==History== left Newman Brothers began life as a brass foundry company, established in 1882 by brothers Alfred and Edwin Newman. In 1894, the company moved to a new factory at 13‚Äì15 Fleet Street in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, designed by Roger Harley in 1892. The move to the new factory coincided with a change in Newman Brothers‚Äô production line; the company was now listed as a ‚ÄòCoffin Furniture Manufacturer‚Äô and specialised in the manufacture of brass furniture for use in the production of coffins. This specialisation was unsurprising, as not only did the production of coffin furnishings use similar manufacturing techniques and processes, but the funerary industry presented more opportunity for profit. The term \\"coffin furniture\\" refers to a wide range of products from handles, crucifixes, nameplates and ornaments to 'soft goods' such as shrouds, funerary gowns, coffin linings and cushions. The factory's warehouse as it would have appeared in the 1960s. Edwin ceased to be involved in the business from 1895, leaving Alfred as the business‚Äô sole trader until his death in 1933. He was succeeded by his two sons, George and Horace, who ran the company until their deaths in 1944 and 1952 respectively. Horace's death marked the end of the Newman family's direct management of the factory, though his sister Nina continued to own shares in the factory until 1980. The running of the business passed to the Doggart and Whittington families, alongside a group of shareholder directors. Newman Brothers‚Äô last owner, Joyce Green, acquired the company in 1976 following the death of the company's two main managing directors. Green was associated with the company for over 50 years; she joined the firm as a secretary in 1949, moving up through the ranks until she bought the company in 1989, and was sole owner until the company ceased trading in 1998. During its years in operation, the factory produced some of the finest up-market coffin furniture in the world, used in the funerals of statesmen such as Sir Winston Churchill and Joseph Chamberlain as well as in funerals for members of the royal family, including George V, George VI, the Queen Mother and Princess Diana. At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, the company employed around 100 people and was exporting products internationally to West Africa, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, the Caribbean, Canada and Malta. The 1960s represented a peak in the company's success and the increased funding that this provided allowed for the partial modernisation of the factory site; the original 19th century single-storey range was demolished and replaced with a two-storey brick building containing managerial, electroplating, warehousing and barrelling facilities.Design Statement Part 1, planning application reference number C/03367/08/LBC. Submitted to Birmingham City Council on 20 June 2008. Retrieved 16 September 2008 The company's success was not to last however as by the 1970s, a number of factors began to lead to the decline of the business. One of the central contributing factors was the decrease in the popularity of metal coffin furniture, a change which was facilitated largely by the increasing popularity of cremation in the UK. Legislation outlawing the use of metal coffin furniture in cremations began to appear across the country in the 1960s and injection moulded plastic emerged as the most common material used to make coffin fittings. Whilst Newman Brothers did produce a single range of plastic handles, breastplates and lid motifs, they were generally unwilling to compromise their reputation as manufacturers of the highest quality goods. The firm was reluctant to modernise and update their manufacturing processes and continued to produce high quality, cast brass coffin fittings until the company was forced to cease trading in 1998. The company, which up until this point had been one of only three coffin furniture manufacturers still operational in the UK, was officially dissolved the following year. ==Restoration== left Joyce Green led the fight for the factory's restoration as a museum following the company's collapse in the 1990s, not wishing to see the building redeveloped or the company's social history forgotten. In 2000, the factory received Grade II* listed status from English Heritage. In March 2001, Birmingham Conservation Trust carried out a feasibility study on the building and raised concerns about the threat of redevelopment and the possible loss of the building. As a result, they appealed to Advantage West Midlands, who purchased the building in 2003 and agreed to fund the Trust in their scheme to bring the building back into use. In the same year, the factory was one of the candidates on the first series of Restoration on the BBC. Though it did not receive enough votes to reach the final, the appearance increased public interest in the project. The appearance was followed by a period of stagnation however, when uncertainty over funding meant that a business plan couldn't be drawn up until 2005. A ¬£1.5 million grant secured in 2006 put the project back on track, and Birmingham Conservation Trust appointed a full professional team in 2007. The project met with a further hurdle in 2009, when Advantage West Midlands collapsed following the withdrawal of its funding by the government. The organisation was thus unable to offer the project any more grants, and whilst a grant from Birmingham City Council enabled Birmingham Conservation Trust to buy the building from Advantage West Midlands in 2010, project costs had to be reduced by half. The project survived despite the rethink however, with a new business plan and an extra ¬£1 million of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowing Birmingham Conservation Trust to move forward with the restoration. The factory courtyard, two years after its restoration in 2014. The restoration took place between July 2013 and September 2014 and cost ¬£3.4 million altogether. Building contractors Fairhurst Ward Abbotts, architects Rodney Melville and Partners and a wider professional team contracted by Birmingham Conservation Trust worked hard over the course of a year to transform Newman Brothers at the Coffin Works from a semi-derelict building into a visitor attraction and mixed-use development. The transformation aimed to retain and restore as many of the factory's original features as possible. To this end, the original 19th century building was not altered, though it was repaired where necessary and the existing slate roof was stripped and replaced with Welsh slates. The plastic rainwater guttering was replaced with cast iron, whilst the modern company sign on the front was removed and replaced with Victorian-style signage. The three main rooms which were restored as part of the museum were the \\"stamp room\\", where breastplates and other decorative items were produced using drop stamps and fly presses, the \\"shroud room\\", where shrouds and coffin linings were made, and the warehouse, where goods were packed and stored ready for shipment. The factory's 1960s offices were also restored, alongside the factory's impressive courtyard and gated cart entrance. The museum opened to the public in October 2014. Green had continued her personal involvement in the project until her death in 2009. ==Newman Brothers Museum== The Newman Brothers Museum takes visitors on guided tours around the restored factory site, telling the story of the company's history through the personal stories of people who worked for Newman Brothers. The site also houses office spaces for small local businesses. ==References *Birmingham Conservation Trust: Newman Bros.

It is the largest institution of higher learning in the city of Fuyang. ==History== Founding and early history The college developed on the basis of \\"Anhui Normal University\\", Fuyang Campus. Its predecessors are \\"Teachers School of Fuyang Region of Anhui Province\\", \\"Fuyang High School Teachers Training School\\" and \\"Fuyang High School Teachers Express Class\\". In 1957, \\"Fuyang High School Teachers Express Class\\" was founded, comprising two- year programs of Chinese literature and mathematics, and one-year programs of physics, chemistry and geography. In the fall of 1957, the Express Class was renamed \\"Fuyang High School Teachers Training School\\", and the subjects of Chinese literature and mathematics merged into \\"Hefei Normal School\\". The remaining one-year programs were transformed into Physics and Chemistry Department and History and Geography Department, and were planned to be extended one more year. However, due to the \\"Anti-rightists campaign\\", those students were sent to work in the winter break of 1958. In September 1958, the Training School became \\"Fuyang Regional Teachers School of Anhui Province\\". Zhang Jianhua (), the then vice director of Fuyang Administrative Region, served as the president, and Wang Gancheng () as vice president and Party chief. It consisted of departments of Chinese literature, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, history and geography, all being two-year programs. It launched an additional politics express class in 1960, and recruited two preparatory classes from junior high graduates, all of whom were transferred to Fuyang Normal School in 1962. In spring of 1962, the school became \\"Fuyang High School Teachers Training School\\", and the main purpose was to train high school teachers. The enrollment began in the fall of that year, and subjects included Chinese literature, maths, foreign language, biochemistry and politics. In summer of 1963, the students graduated prematurely, and most of them were assigned to teach in primary schools. A few of them continued their training in the Teachers Training School of Liu'an High School, and Provincial Education Institute. The enrollment was discontinued in the fall of 1964, and the school was transformed to host a two-month training program for high school administrative staff and eminent teachers, and a three-month program for teachers of agricultural high schools. Tang Zhaohua served as the president and party chief. It recruited 284 from teachers in agricultural schools in 1965, and had two one-year programs, literature and maths. However, due to the outbreak of Cultural Revolution, their graduation had been postponed till 1968. Cultural Revolution During Cultural Revolution, the whole school was ordered to relocate to rural area, and in Linquan County, two high schools were formed in Tanpeng Commune and Gaotang Commune, respectively. At that time, there were totally 99 instructors and staff. Besides 33 workers, the rest had all been sent to the countryside. The school suffered great losses in school buildings, teaching tools, documents and books, and equipment. Recovery and renaming China's education section began partially recovery in 1974. On the original site of the Training School founded the \\"Anhui Normal University\\", Fuyang Campus, which was jointly administered by provincial and regional government. Tang Zhaohua again served as the head, called chairman of school's revolutionary committee. It had five departments, literature, maths, foreign language, physics and chemistry, and fine art, consisting six majors. In addition, there were a Marxism‚ÄìLeninism teaching office and a sports teaching office, responsible for school-wide public politics and physical education. At the end of 1978, approved by the State Council, the Fuyang Campus was expanded and renamed \\"Fuyang Teachers College\\". On September 1, 1979, the college party committee was officially formed, and on September 20, the founding ceremony was held for Fuyang Teachers College, and September 20 was also named college's founding day. ==Campuses== Fuyang Teachers College contains two campuses. The Qinghe Campus (), also known as the East Campus, is the original campus. The West Lake Campus (), also known as the West Campus, is a larger campus built in recent years. ==Students and faculty== In total, Fuyang Teachers College has over 18,000 students and more than 900 full-time teachers. ==References * Official website of Fuyang Teachers College Category:Universities and colleges in Anhui Category:Educational institutions established in 1979 Category:Educational institutions established in 1957 Category:1979 establishments in China ","title":"Fuyang Normal University"},{"id":"19347849","text":"Heriberto Correa Yepes (August 6, 1916 - September 9, 2010) was a Colombian Prelate of Roman Catholic Church.

The rapper describes his writing and writing process for the 2019 album Persona in an interview on Rolling Stone Italy: \\"It develops over time, in the sense that I mature stuff, it's something I do on an introspective level, I do it without writing. I just take notes and then at a certain point I throw them out, and when I started writing the pieces flowed out like blood from a wound.\\" He then describes his feelings and the way he analyzes the situations he reports in the texts: \\"I exercise a constant self- consciousness that leads me to experience emotions very intensely. [...] But each time I tend to pull the rope a bit to its extreme and it is perhaps also a way to feel alive, a search for adrenaline, because in the end I detach myself enough to find them stronger than before.\\" == Criticism and controversy == In 2006, when Marracash criticized Nesli's way of rapping through the song \\"Popular\\", a kind of rivalry between the two began. The following year, in fact, Nesli responded to Marracash with the song \\"Life is just one\\", accusing him of making neighborhood rhymes and being a chatterbox. Marracash's response came in 2008 with the song \\"Dritto al punto\\", in which he reversed the quotations made by the opposing rapper, who replied with \\"Riot\\", closing the debate. On January 14, 2017, six months after the publication of Santeria, Marracash and Gu√© Pequenoo gave an interview to Corriere della Sera, in which they commented on the musical style adopted by their colleagues Fedez and J-Ax, at the time close to the publication of Comunisti col Rolex, criticizing the artists and accusing them of masking their intent to make numbers and money with false intentions. Fedez responded to the accusations by explaining that the two rappers criticized the duo on purpose to have visibility, as well as calling Marracash a coward to not meet him during Moschino's fashion show; Marracash, referring to Fedez as \\"dwarf with Napoleon complex\\", denied what Fedez said about the fashion show, claiming that the colleague had not even sought eye contact with him on that occasion, and ironic about the choice to attend the parades with bodyguards. ==Discography== Albums Solo * 2008 - Marracash * 2010 - Fino a qui tutto bene * 2011 - King del Rap * 2015 - Status * 2016 - Santeria * 2019 - Persona (No. 1 Italy) Mixtapes * 2005 - Roccia Music Vol. 1 * 2011 - Roccia Music II With Dogo Gang * 2004 - PMC VS Club Dogo: The Official Mixtape * 2008 - Benvenuti nella giungla Singles * 2008 - \\"Badabum Cha Cha\\" (Platinum) * 2008 - \\"Estate in citt√†\\" * 2008 - \\"Non confondermi\\" * 2009 - \\"Tutto questo\\" * 2010 - \\"Cani pazzi\\" * 2010 - \\"Stupido\\" * 2010 - \\"Fino a qui tutto bene\\" * 2010 - \\"Rivincita\\" (featuring Giusy Ferreri) * 2010 - \\"Parole chiave\\" * 2011 - \\"King del Rap\\" * 2011 - \\"Didin√≤\\" * 2012 - \\"Sabbie mobili\\" * 2012 - \\"Noi siamo il club\\" (Feat.

Gulf menhaden are a dull silver with a greenish back. Like their Atlantic counterpart, Gulf menhaden have a prominent black spot found behind the gill cover followed by a row of smaller spots Louisiana Fisheries Diet Gulf menhaden are filter feeders, meaning that they collect food by filtering water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill or branchial arches and gill rakers). Like Atlantic menhaden, Gulf menhaden's diet depends on the size of their gill rakers, which change as menhaden age. Larval gulf menhaden feed primary on zooplankton because the rakers are not well developed. The juveniles, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Gulf menhaden feed more on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill rakers fully developed, menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume phytoplankton.‚ÄúMenhaden Facts.‚Äù Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. Life cycle Spawning occurs offshore in winter (October‚ÄìMarch). Eggs and larvae are pelagic and are carried into estuarine nursery areas via prevailing currents. As a result, migration at this stage can be lengthy, and populations of Gulf menhaden throughout the Gulf of Mexico are generally thought to comprise a single genetic stock.Anderson, J.D. 2006.

In 2013, the fishery supported four of the nation's top ten ports by volume of landings.National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Science and Technology, ‚ÄúFisheries of the United States 2013,‚Äù September 2014 Gulf menhaden are harvested primarily for fish meal and fish oil based products. A much smaller number of menhaden are caught for use as bait. In addition to being one of the largest fisheries in the US, the Gulf menhaden fishery has also been recognized internationally for its sustainability. The fishery's sustainability has also been certified by independent organizations. Friend of the Sea, an international seafood sustainability certification program, has recognized both the Atlantic menhaden and Gulf menhaden fisheries as sustainable.Friend of the Sea, ‚ÄúFisheries USA ‚Äì Purse seine ‚Äì Gulf menhaden, Atlantic menhaden ‚Äì FAO Western Atlantic Ocean‚Äù This is both due to the healthy status of the stock as well as the fishery's low levels of bycatch, which it achieves with the use of purse seine nets. Recreational fishery The gulf menhaden is an important bait fish for recreational anglers. Management Gulf menhaden are managed by an interstate compact called the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission (GSMFC). According to the most recent 2013 stock assessment by the GSMFC, Gulf menhaden are ‚Äúneither overfished nor experiencing overfishing.‚ÄùGulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, ‚ÄúStock Assessment Report for Gulf of Mexico Gulf Menhaden (SEDAR32A) and Adoption of Reference Points,‚Äù November 14, 2013 According to the GSMFC, ‚Äúthe Gulf menhaden fishery is probably the most closely monitored and managed fishery in the Gulf of Mexico.‚Äù An example of the fishery's monitoring is the Gulf of Mexico purse seine fishery's participation in NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Observer Program since 2011.[NOAA, ‚ÄúNational Observer Program, FY 2011 Annual Report‚Äù] Specifically, the Menhaden Advisory Committee (MAC) is the GSMFC subcommittee that oversees menhaden management. Dead zones According to the GSMFC: ‚ÄúMenhaden do not have the capacity to reduce unwanted phytoplankton blooms that arise from manmade sources, primarily because they eat mostly zooplankton. In addition, menhaden excrete large amounts of ammonia (a nitrogenous product), contributing to an already high nitrogen load.‚Äù In addition, the commercial menhaden fishery only targets adult menhaden, which consume zooplankton, not juvenile menhaden, which do consume phytoplankton NOAA, ‚ÄúBrief History of the Gulf Menhaden Purse-Seine Fishery‚Äù == Sources  External links == *Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, menhaden page Gulf menhaden Category:Fish of the Gulf of Mexico Gulf menhaden ","title":"Gulf menhaden"},{"id":"19348017","text":"The Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS), is a GIS software technology. Development of MOSS began in late 1977 and was first deployed for use in 1979. MOSS represents a very early public domain, open source GIS development - predating the better known GRASS by 5 years. MOSS utilized a polygon based data structure in which point, line, and polygon features could all be stored in the same file. The user interacted with MOSS via a command line interface. ==History== In the middle 1970s, coal-mining activities required Federal agencies to evaluate the impacts of strip mine development on wildlife and wildlife habitat. They were further tasked with evaluating and making recommendations regarding habitat mitigation. In 1976, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) for developing a Geographic Information System [GIS] for environment impact and habitat mitigation studies. The scope of the project included completing a User Needs assessment, developing a GIS functional scope, evaluating existing GIS technologies, and making recommendations to the USFWS as to the appropriate course of action for the development and deployment of GIS technology. In late 1976, the contract was awarded to the Federation of Rocky Mountain States, a not for profit organization that eventually evolved into the Western Governors‚Äô Policy Office. For the first six months of 1977, the project team worked on two tasks: A User Needs Assessment and an Inventory of Existing GIS technology. The needs assessment involved interviewing wildlife biologists, natural resources planners, and other professionals that would be involved in wildlife habitat definition and habitat mitigation. The results of the assessment were published in the summer of 1977. Concurrently, Carl Reed did an inventory of existing public domain and commercial GIS technology. Approximately 70 different mapping and GIS software packages were identified. Of these, 54 had enough documentation and basic required functionality to warrant further analysis in terms of matching GIS functionality against user requirements. This document is a valuable historical document as it has information and details of systems long extinct and forgotten. The evaluation resulted in the determination that no existing GIS capability provided even a fraction of the functional capability required to meet user needs. Therefore, the decision was made to design and program a new interactive GIS application that used existing publicly available software whenever possible. Using the user requirements as the design driver, the design of MOSS began during the summer of 1977. Once the group agreed on the design, programming started. The development environment was a CDC mainframe running the Kronos operating system. Fortran IV was the development language. Graphics presentation and code development was done on a Tektronix 4010. Initial programming was completed in 1978 In 1978, MOSS was used in a Pilot Project in 1978 totest the validity of using the new MOSS software in a real world FWS habitat mitigation project. The pilot project used vector and raster map data digitized from USGS base maps, from aerial imagery, and maps provided by other agencies. The Pilot project was successful and allowed additional enhancements and bug fixes to be accomplished for deploying MOSS for production use. By 1979, a user accessible version of MOSS was available on the CDC mainframe. In late 1979, the FWS purchased a Data General computer (AOS Operating System) and required MOSS to be ported from the CDC mainframe to the DG minicomputer. This work was completed in the summer of 1980. By the middle of 1980, the MOSS software suite was ready for production use. Once installed, operational, and properly documented at the WELUT facility in Fort Collins Colorado, an extensive technology transfer and training acvtivity began. Within a few years, numerous other Federal agencies were using MOSS for a variety of projects. By 1983, MOSS was being used in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, multiple Bureau of Land Management State Offices, the Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, US Army Engineering Topographic Labs, Fish and Wildlife Service, and numerous State, Local and University organizations. The first MOSS Users Workshop was held in 1983 and had about 30 attendees. The second users workshop was held in Denver in 1984 with almost 150 attendees. ==Architecture== MOSS allowed the user to store both vector and raster in the same geospatial database. The vector data could be points, lines, or polygons. MOSS utilized what at the time was referred to as a \\"full polygon\\" representation. In a full polygon representation, each polygon vertex shared with another polygon. Polygons could have islands (holes). Raster data were stored as pixels. The early versions of MOSS only allowed up to 32,000 coordinate pairs per line or polygon feature. This was due to Fortran array addressing issues. Raster images could be no larger than 32,000 pixels per row. Each map in a MOSS database could have up to 32,000 features. There was no limit on the number of maps in the database. Each map had a map header that contained a variety of metadata, such as the coordinate reference system (projection), date of creation, owner, data of last update, description, and so forth. Metadata was \\"searchable\\". ==References== * Comparison of Selected Operational Capabilities of 54 Geographic Information Systems. FRMS, 1977 (Gropper, Hamill, Reed, Salmen).

The pilot was written by series creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, and directed by Alex Graves. The episode introduces the character Olivia Dunham, portrayed by Anna Torv, an FBI special agent drawn into the world of applied fringe science. John Noble portrays Dr. Walter Bishop, a scientist formerly incarcerated in a mental institution for over seventeen years. Joshua Jackson plays his son, Peter, who is hired by Olivia to assist with Walter's work. Although the pilot was set in and around Boston, filming occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, making it one of the most expensive pilots in television history. The pilot was leaked online three months prior to its broadcast on television. There was speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program; however, this was denied by executive producer Bryan Burk. The episode was generally well received by critics, and was watched by 9.13 million American viewers on its premiere. ==Plot== A man on an international flight injects himself with an insulin pen, which releases a biological agent that quickly kills everyone aboard by causing their flesh to crystallize. The airplane's autopilot system lands the plane at Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create a task force to investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick). Following a tip, Dunham and Scott are sent to a storage facility where they uncover a biochemical laboratory, which explodes when detonated by a suspect they are chasing. Scott is affected by the chemicals released in the explosion, and is placed into an artificial coma to slow the progression of the chemical reaction. While investigating a possible cure to Scott's condition, Dunham blackmails Peter Bishop (Jackson) to gain access to his father Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), whose top-secret work at Harvard in \\"fringe science\\" resulted in him being sent to a mental institution. Dunham manages to release Walter from the institution; however, he becomes enraged when he discovers his laboratory in Harvard has been shut down. Broyles reopens the laboratory, where Dunham transfers Scott's body. To identify the man from the storage facility, Walter synchronizes Dunham's brainwaves with the comatose Scott's so that she can read his mind. Walter claims that syncing brainwaves, and even reanimating the dead, can be accomplished up to six hours after death. With the help of Dunham's assistant, federal agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), the experiment succeeds. Dunham identifies the man in Scott's memory, Morgan Steig, as a passenger on the plane. The team learns Steig's twin brother, Richard Steig, was an employee of Massive Dynamic, a company founded by William Bell, Walter's old lab partner. Dunham goes to Massive Dynamic headquarters and meets with executive director Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who agrees to give her all the information on Steig. The suspect is arrested and initially refuses to provide a list of the ingredients present in the toxin, but Peter's threat of exposing him to the chemicals causes him to reveal the ingredients. The information provides a cure for Scott. The suspect reveals that he did not sell his chemicals, but was forced into what he did by someone from Dunham's office. The suspect leads Dunham to a buried tape recording of his phone conversations about the chemicals and the attack, where Dunham realizes that Scott was involved with the attack from the beginning. While she races back to the hospital, Scott awakens and kills the suspect. He is chased by Dunham, but crashes his car and is mortally wounded. Before he dies, Scott asks Dunham why Broyles would send her to investigate the storage units in the first place. Dunham convinces the Bishops to stay and help her with her new work, which Broyles describes as a task force to investigate events related to \\"the pattern\\". Elsewhere, Scott's dead body is brought to a Massive Dynamic high-tech lab, where Sharp orders that Scott be interrogated, since he has only been dead for five hours. ==Production== Abrams encouraged audiences to watch because \\"one of the assets we happen to have are three great characters played by three wonderful actors at the core of the show.\\" Co-creator J. J. Abrams' inspiration for Fringe came from a range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not \\"evident but alluded to in the pilot.\\" The team spent a lot of time thinking about the \\"trifecta of characters\\" that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, \\"you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character.\\" Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an \\"extremely serialized and very culty\\" series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost. The first actors cast in the pilot were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley in mid January 2008. John Noble and Lance Reddick were next to be cast, although it was incorrectly believed that Tomas Arana had been cast in Reddick's role. This was followed by the casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown and Jasika Nicole. Abrams said that Torv was cast because she was a combination of \\"sophistication, great talent, amazing looks and a complexity that is the key to the character being an interesting central character.\\" Kurtzman felt that she was someone \\"you want to spend time with\\", which was critical to a series about science. Joshua Jackson was the last series regular to be cast. Jackson auditioned for the role of James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project. According to Abrams, Jackson's casting was \\"very last minute.\\" While the pilot was set in and around Boston, production was set in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, making it one of the most expensive pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced to hire a new cow for the remainder of the season because they were not allowed to transport the original cow from Canada to New York. Production team members noted that they were prepared to paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots. Three months prior to its broadcast, an incomplete version of the pilot was released through BitTorrent clients, fueling speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. Executive producer Burk denied the claims, saying that \\"we hate putting anything out there until it's done, and that's really the reason why you guys didn't get any advance copies.\\" Abrams said that while the production crew \\"freaked out\\" about the leak, he was pleased that the \\"response has been much more positive than not, especially for something that wasn't completed yet.\\" The broadcast version of the pilot had new scenes added while other scenes were removed; Abrams also said that there was \\"tightening and moving some moments here and there\\", and the ending was entirely different. Burk also stated that the composer, Michael Giacchino, had not finished his score at the time of the leak, and the most of the featured music was temp music. A variation of a piece of Giacchino's music called \\"Hollywood and Vines\\" used in the pilot was originally featured on Lost, as it was created for that show, also created by Abrams. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Pilot\\" was watched by 9.13 million American viewers, with ratings improving over the course of the episode. The episode garnered a 3.2/9 Nielsen ratings in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic, and was the 12th most watched series of the week. The 3.2 refers to 3.2% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old in the U.S., and the 9 refers to 9% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. The pilot officially premiered at the 2008 Television Critics Association tour, where it received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Reviews Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore‚Äîa weighted average based on the impressions of a select 25 critical reviews‚Äîof 67, signifying generally favorable reviews. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter found it promising because \\"it is reminiscent of better-of-the-sexes charm.\\" USA Todays Robert Bianco said, \\"what Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN gave the pilot 7.6 out of 10, calling it \\"a lackluster pilot that promises to be a pretty good series.\\" Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle remarked that despite \\"some flaws in it‚Äîmostly from a clash of tones‚Äîit still overdelivers on creativity, creepiness, fine acting and burgeoning character development.\\" Chicago Sun-Times Misha Davenport called it an \\"update of The X-Files with the addition of terrorism and the office of Homeland Security. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail called the pilot \\"splendidly made.\\" However, Doyle considered the instance of Torv stripping to a bikini \\"indulgent\\", and questioned the wisdom of making \\"her body an object of scrutiny\\" in the first episode. Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe wrote that \\"after the electrifying start, Fringe unfolds as an uneven, unwieldy piece of work that provides very few chills and thrills.\\" LA Weeklys Robert Abele found Fringe is \\"a smorgasbord of a show, but one a little too synthetically engineered to allow you the chance to discover what it is.\\" John Leonard of New York was skeptical of the premise and storyline, but found Torv \\"wonderfully played\\" her character. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com felt the plot was too over-the-top, and described Abrams as \\"the ultimate boyish idiot- savant imaginator... He can't exercise a little self-restraint.\\" The pilot episode was negatively received by the conservative \\"family values\\" advocacy group Parents Television Council, who named the show the worst of the week and denounced the \\"excessive violence and gore.\\" ==References External links == * \\"Pilot\\" at Fox * * Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 1) episodes Fringe Category:Television episodes written by J.

He was ordained a priest by Bishop Eugeniusz Baziak in Lvov on June 21, 1942. On December 2, 1965, he was appointed a Bishop of the Diocese of Przemy≈õl, and was consecrated by Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski on February 6, 1966. On June 2, 1991, Tokarczuk was bestowed a personal title of archbishop by John Paul II. On March 25, 1992, he became a metropolitan Archbishop of Przemy≈õl. As the Bishop of Przemysl, he was known for building a great number of churches in his diocese despite the lack of having permission to build from the communist authorities. It is said that he has erected nearly 430 churches during his tenure as a bishop. He was also a great supporter of the Solidarity movement. For his uncompromising stance in the defense of the institution of the Catholic Church in the People's Republic of Poland, he was repeatedly harassed by the Polish Security Service. Tokarczuk retired from the Archdiocese of Przemy≈õl on April 17, 1993 and was succeeded by Archbishop J√≥zef Michalik. Tokarczuk was also a recipient of the Order of White Eagle, and from 2007 to 2009, he was a member of the Grand Chapter of the Order. ==See also== * Archdiocese of Przemy≈õl ==References * Catholic-Hierarchy * Przemy≈õl Diocese Category:1918 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Bishops of Przemy≈õl Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin alumni Category:John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin faculty ","title":"Ignacy Tokarczuk"},{"id":"19348037","text":"The Strongman Champions League is a strongman competition circuit, with several grand prix events throughout the year and the Strongman Champions League overall champion title going to the overall winner at the end of the season. The competitors include some of the top athletes in the sport, including ≈Ωydr≈´nas Savickas, Krzysztof Radzikowski, Travis Ortmayer, Nick Best, Mikhail Koklyaev, Ervin Katona, Andrus Murumets, Laurence Shahlaei, Vytautas Lalas and Terry Hollands. Initially in close partnership with IFSA, it quickly asserted its independence and has acted as a unifying force in the world of strength athletics, bringing together athletes from IFSA with those affiliated to the World's Strongest Man circuit, and having close cooperation with other major events such as Fortissimus. In 2012, SCL began co-promoting the new Arnold Strongman Classic-Europe contest which will become part of the annual SCL season of events. ==History== Strongman Champions League in Gibraltar. Strongman Champions League in Gibraltar. The Strongman Champions League was developed by Ilkka Kinnunen and Marcel Mostert, longtime strongman promoters, with major contests to their credit worldwide, and was launched in 2008. Kinnunen & Mostert described SCL as \\"a new episode in strongman\\". \\"A complete series of 10‚Äì12 competitions, that will take place all over the world, but most of the competitions will be held in Europe. The very best champions, referees and their organizers will be the guarantee of a great new, fresh excitement in Strongman sport. The competition venues are the best which each country can offer and it will include the country's own traditional elements.\\" As well as citing that all points will be accumulated for a Champions League Winner at the end of the year, the organisers also explicitly stated that \\"Rules will be done officially as and that \\"The top 3 will be directly placed in the World Championships\\". Mostert also said \\"All together we think that this is a perfect platform of competitions that will lead to another great World Championship.\\". Thus, IFSA were inextricably linked at the inception of the league. IFSA, however, were in reportedly dire financial straits towards the end of that year. By December, Mostert distanced the league from the ailing governing body and explicitly said that the Strongman Champions League had nothing to do with IFSA. He told IronMind \\"We have our own logo, we have our own brand, we do our own competitions.\\"Strongman Champions League: Independent of IFSA, New Website by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D. 2009 IronMind, Tuesday, December 9, 2008 Its own website was launched shortly afterwards. The league organisers had originally reported that Champions League competitions \\"will be televised and spread all over the world and they released a list of venues that had been organised in advance. In the harsh economic climate of 2008, the league was not immune to the effects, and the league did have to cancel some venues, but unlike with the IFSA, the vast majority of the competitions still took place. In 2008, the SCL had 45 top strength athletes competing, representing more than 20 countries. Fortissimus Cooperation In 2008 Paul Ohl stated that the Strongman Champions League was one of three organisations that had made an agreement with Fortissimus in order to unite the world strength community, the others being the American Strongman Corporation, and the Aussiepower organization. Within the agreement, Fortissimus, the competition that confers the title of \\"Strongest Man on the Planet\\", guaranteed that the winner of the America's Strongest Man title would be granted a slot in Fortissimus from 2009, as would the winner of the Australia's Strongest Man title. The agreement with the Strongman Champions League went further, stating that the top three athletes would have guaranteed places and in return the top Canadian athletes would have guaranteed selected participation in the Champions League.Fortissimus Enters Agreement with Strongman Champions League, the American Strongman Corporation and Aussiepower by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D. 2009 IronMind Friday, May 16, 2008 This later went further, guaranteeing the SCL its top five athletes would have places. The agreement was reemphasised in a joint statement from Marcel Mostert and Paul Ohl in early 2009. 2009 and links with WSM The 2009 programme was planned with ten major contests on schedule. In addition, feeder contests were introduced, one happening in Spain in December 2008 and a further event in Germany called the FIBO Strongman Classic in April 2009. The best two athletes from this FIBO classic 2009 edition were guaranteed into the Champions League, and it was postulated that this German event would be promoted to full SCL status in 2010. The Strongman Champions League importantly made further progress in acting as a fundamental part of a unifying movement for world strength athletics by making plans to help get its athletes to the 2009 World's Strongest Man contest. Mostert stated that \\"The top 5 SCL athletes will have places in the Giants Live tour for qualifying at World's Strongest Man (WSM) 2009\\". In addition, he also stated that wild cards for the WSM will include SCL athletes. He went on to say that \\"Finally we made it all possible again that all the athletes have chances to qualify for the WSM, which means in my opinion the WSM will have the strongest field ever in her history!\\". He went on to thank TWI/IMG and Giants Live for their part in making these possibilities. This was groundbreaking because for a number of years prior to this, the athletes under the IFSA had been banned by the federation from entering WSM (since the IFSA fell out of favour with TWI). Likewise, the athletes invited to participate in WSM were not invited to participate in IFSA events. Some competitions bridged the divide, such as the Arnold Strongman Classic and more recently Fortissimus, but neither had the history or gravitas, or indeed popular appeal of the iconic World's Strongest Man. The IFSA athletes, with the demise of the IFSA finances, almost all competed in SCL from 2008. This deal, along with the Fortissimus deal before it, united strongman in a way it had not been since 2004. The 2009 season began properly on 9 May, with the Strongman Champions League Serbia.

During his childhood, his family lived in Z√ºrich, but following the death of his father, Schneider moved to Dresden, where in 1889 he became a student at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1903, he met best-selling author Karl May, and subsequently became the cover illustrator of a number of May's books including Winnetou, Old Surehand, Am Rio de la Plata. A year later in 1904, Schneider was appointed professor at the Gro√üherzoglich-S√§chsische Kunstschule Weimar. During this period, Schneider lived with painter .Bernd-Ulrich Hergem√∂ller, Mann f√ºr Mann, pages 636, 637 Jahn began blackmailing Schneider by threatening to expose his homosexuality, which was punishable under ¬ß 175 of the penal code. Schneider fled to Italy, where homosexuality was not criminalized at that time. In Italy, Schneider met painter , with whom he traveled through the Caucasus Mountains. He then traveled back to Germany, where he lived for six months in Leipzig before returning to Italy, where he resided in Florence. When the First World War started, Schneider returned to Germany again, taking up residence in Hellerau (near Dresden). After 1918, he co-founded an institute called Kraft-Kunst for bodybuilding.Bernd-Ulrich Hergem√∂ller, Mann f√ºr Mann, pages 636, 637 Some of the models for his art trained here. Schneider, who suffered from diabetes mellitus, suffered a diabetic seizure during a ship voyage in the vicinity of Swinem√ºnde. As a result, he collapsed and died in 1927 in Swinem√ºnde. He was buried in Loschwitz Cemetery, Germany. ==In popular culture== Schneider's painting Hypnosis (in Gallery below) inspired a key shot in the Robert Eggers film The Lighthouse. ==Works== * Mein Gestalten und Bilden. 1912. autobiography ==Exhibitions== *Sascha Schneider - Ideenmaler & K√∂rperbildner/\\"Sascha Schneider - Visualizing ideas through the human body\\" (2013), Stadtmuseum Weimar *\\"Nude in Public: Sascha Schneider - Homoeroticism and the Male Form circa 1900\\" (2013), Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art ==Gallery== File:Anarchist (Schneider).jpg\\"The Anarchist\\" (1894) File:Old Surehand.jpgCover illustration for Old Surehand by Karl May (1904) File:Winnetou.jpgCover illustration for Winnetou III by Karl May (1904) Image:Sascha Schneider - Am Rio De La Plata.jpgCover illustration for Am Rio De La Plata by Karl May (1904) File:Sascha Schneider Ardistan.jpgCover illustration for Ardistan und Dschinnistan by Karl May (1904) File:Hypnose (Schneider).jpg\\"Hypnosis\\" (1904) File:Friede auf Erden.jpg\\"Peace on Earth\\" (1904) File:Morgend√§mmerung von Sascha Schneider.jpg\\"Dawn\\" (1905) File:Ikarus (Schneider).jpg\\"Icarus\\" (1906) File:Mondnacht.jpg\\"Moon Night\\" (1906) File:Gymnasion.jpg\\"Gymnasion\\" (ca. 1912) File:Gef√ºhl der Abh√§ngigkeit.jpg\\"Feeling of Dependence\\" (1920) File:Tobias und der Engel.jpg\\"Tobias and the Angel\\" (1921) File:J√ºngling im blauen Mantel.jpg\\"Youth in a Blue Coat\\" (1921) ==Literature== * Hans-Gerd R√∂der: Sascha Schneider - ein Maler f√ºr Karl May.

He returned for a short time to his family's farm in Berkeley County, Virginia (now West Virginia). He settled in Philadelphia in 1779, where he served as assistant auditor general for the Board of Treasury. He was elected register in 1781, where he assumed responsibility for keeping the financial records and accounts of the new government. He also authenticated each piece of Continental currency by personally signing it. In 1800, he moved with the federal government from Philadelphia to the Washington, D.C. He purchased a residence at 3101 P Street in Georgetown. In 1804, he acquired Cedar Hill, now known as Dumbarton House, where he lived until 1813. As Register of the Treasury, he worked closely with four administrations and early political leaders of the new nation. When Andrew Jackson was elected president in 1829, Nourse was forced from office. A Congressional investigation claimed that Nourse owed the government $11,769.13 due to misappropriation of funds. Nourse countered that the government owed him for \\"uncompensated services\\". A Federal circuit court awarded him about $23,582, but it was seven years after his death until his heirs were able to collect. ==References== Category:1754 births Category:1841 deaths Category:United States Department of the Treasury officials Category:People from Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)

It is endemic to the Channel Islands of California, where it is known from only three or four populations on two of the eight islands. A 2005 report estimated a remaining global population of 244 individual plants.The Nature Conservancy It is a federally listed endangered species. This is a perennial herb producing one or more erect stems from a scaly, hairy caudex. The stems reach a maximum height between 50 and 70 centimeters and branch near the top. Leaves are densely clustered around the caudex in a basal rosette. They are lance-shaped, leathery with hairy undersides, and up to 10 centimeters long. There are more widely spaced leaves along the stem which are 3 to 6 centimeters long. The inflorescence bears many white or purple flowers with thick, dark sepals. The fruit is a tough, hairless silique up to 10 centimeters long containing 2 rows of seeds. The main threats to the existence of this rare plant are grazing and erosion caused by feral pigs and competition by invasive grasses. The populations of this plant are also slow to reproduce. They are monocarpic, with each individual living for a few years, fruiting once, and then dying, and each population has relatively few actively reproducing individuals in any given year. ==References *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Photo gallery hoffmannii Category:Flora of California Category:NatureServe critically imperiled species ","title":"Boechera hoffmannii"},{"id":"19348126","text":"The 1997 ATP Tour was the elite tour for professional tennis organised by the ATP that year.

In 2007, the Government of Kosovo approved plans for the building.Kosovo Catholics plan cathedral to honour Mother Teresa The cathedral is dedicated to the Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary, Saint Teresa of Calcutta. ==History== In 2005, the foundation stone was ceremonially laid by former President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, himself a Muslim. Construction began in 2007. The unfinished cathedral was inaugurated on 5 September 2010, the anniversary of the death of Mother Teresa in 1997, as part of events commemorating the hundredth anniversary of her birth. The cathedral was formally consecrated seven years later on 5 September 2017, 20 years after Mother Theresa's death. The cathedral's construction sparked some controversy in Muslim circles where it was seen as outsized considering the small number of Catholics in the area. Upon the cathedral's completion, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Prizren-Pristina moved from Prizren to Pristina. The cathedral is one of Pristina's tallest buildings.In Pristina's old Ottoman mosque, Muslims gather for prayers Bell tower An exhibition celebrating the shared history of Albanians and Austria was held in the cathedral in January 2015. It was attended by the President of Kosovo, Atifete Jahjaga, and Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz. ==See also== *Tourism in Kosovo *Religion in Kosovo *Albanians *Mother Teresa *Pristina *Freedom of Religion ==References * On new foundations ‚Äì The construction of the Cathedral of Blessed Mother Teresa in Pristina, a video on YouTube from the Catholic Radio and Television Network (CRTN) about the construction of the Cathedral.

The orphanage, placed on the Malaya Okhta was evacuated in April, 1942 to Armavir by the Road of Life on the Ladoga's ice. However, in August German offensive reached Caucasus, and it was decided to evacuate the orphanage to Abkhazia via Teberda and Caucasus Range. When carts with weakened children entered Beslenei, 40 km west from Cherkessk, the locals, fearing that the children could not survive the transfer via the range, offered to adopt them, especially whom other villagers avoided to adopt due to possible punishment by the Nazis, i.e. Jews. The local selsoviet chairman Sagid Shovgenov and kolkhoz chairman Khusin Lakhov arranged a meeting, where they decided to adopt 36 children and distribute food reserves among the adoptive parents. They also forged all documents in the village, referring to the adoptive families, as well as all documents of the children. Soon, the Germans broke the front and occupied the territory. They met the evacuating orphanage in Teberda and massacred them. They got to know, that some of children stayed in Beslenei and managed to reveal them. However, due to the forgery of all documents and activity of the village elder Murzabek Okhtov, who agreed to be appointed by the Nazis in the purpose to save the children, nobody was discovered. Okhtov managed to convince local German administration, that the denunciations, reporting about children were false. During the five month occupation only one teenager was lost, as he was accused in encroachment of the German soldier's life.

The group enjoyed international success and a prolific musical career recording around 44 records. ==History== The group's name refers to the birth city of Guerra and L√≥pez, Treinta y Tres, Uruguay, on the banks of the Olimar Grande River. In the 1960s, they were part of the first movement of singing popular Uruguayan songs alongside Alfredo Zitarrosa, Daniel Viglietti, Jos√© Carbajal, Numa Moraes, among others. The lyrics of their songs, written mostly by Ruben Lena and Victor Lima, reflected local issues and reflected the concerns and feelings of ordinary people, as well as everyday life in rural areas. Despite having a great attachment to their country, they were not alien to social, cultural and political movements then taking place across Latin America. This led them to participate in various international calls, for example, \\"Encounter with the protest song\\" convened by La Casa de las Am√©ricas of Cuba, and conducted between 9 July and 10 August 1967. As social unrest increased in Uruguay during the 1960s and the early 1970s, Los Olimare√±os, being consistent in their grassroots support, gradually began to include criticism of the repressive government in their songs. The Uruguayan coup d'√©tat on 27 June 1973, resulted in a ban on their songs. In 1974, they began an exile that would last ten years, during which they toured five continents, and settled for long periods in Mexico and Spain. They returned to Uruguay on 18 May 1984 and sang at the Estadio Centenario, in Montevideo, under heavy rain to 50,000 people. In 1990, the duo decided to disband, starting careers as solo performers. A reunion concert was planned for 8 May 2009 at the Estadio Centenario, on the 25th anniversary of their 1984 concert. == Discography ==  Albums  *Los Olimare√±os (1962) *Los Olimare√±os en Par√≠s (1964) *De cojinillo (1965) *Quiero a la sombra de un ala (1966) *Canciones con contenido (1967) *Estrofas de amor (1968) *Nuestra raz√≥n (1969) *Cielo del 69 (1969) *Todos detr√°s de Momo (1971) *¬°Que pena!

NOLHGA was founded in 1983 to coordinate the efforts of state guaranty associations to provide protection to policyholders when their multi-state life or health insurance company becomes insolvent. The organization is based in Herndon, Virginia. ==Mechanism== When an insurance company reports to its state insurance regulator that it is in financial trouble, the state will first attempt to assist the company back toward financial stability. If the state insurance department determines the company cannot be saved, then the insurance commissioner asks the state court to order the liquidation of the company. Once the order to liquidate a company that operates in multiple states is handed down, NOLHGA, on behalf of affected member state guaranty associations, assembles a task force of affected guaranty associations to analyze the company‚Äôs commitments to policyholders. Each affected state guaranty association pays out claims to the insurance company's policyholders in the state; in some instances, the associations arrange for policies to be transferred to a financially sound insurer. Each state guaranty association is governed by state law; most associations cover up to at least $300,000 for life insurance death benefits, $100,000 in cash surrender value for life insurance, $250,000 in withdrawal and cash values for annuities, and $100,000 in health insurance policy benefits. ==Structure== The National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations has four main departments: administrative services, communications, insurance services, and legal. Administrative The Administrative Services Department supports NOLHGA by providing services such as human resources, accounting, membership records, and general facilities management. The department also plans and coordinates the Annual Meeting and provides support services to other departments and to the NOLHGA Board of Directors. Communications The Communications Department develops the organization's outreach efforts to its members, state insurance departments, receivers, insurance companies, and the media. In addition, the department provides communications assistance to individual state guaranty associations, the NOLHGA Board of Directors, and handles all media and public information inquiries. Insurance The Insurance Services Department coordinates all insolvency task force activities, including meetings and negotiations with receivers and assumption reinsurance companies concerning life and health insurers in rehabilitation or liquidation. This can include securing and managing legal, actuarial, and/or administrative services; seeking bids and evaluating the financial soundness of potential reinsurers; and determining the most cost-effective and efficient manner to continue policyholders‚Äô coverage. Insurance Services also provides financial information on insolvencies to NOLHGA members. Legal The Legal Department provides legal counsel to insolvency task forces, committees, and the NOLHGA Board of Directors. The department collects and distributes legal information to member state guaranty associations and serves as an information resource for case laws. The department also coordinates the efforts of NOLHGA‚Äôs Legal Committee, which addresses issues pertaining to the insolvency process and develops strategies for related lawsuits. ==References *NOLHGA website *Guaranty association laws by state Category:Organizations established in 1983 Category:Insurance in the United States Category:Insurance organizations ","title":"National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations"},{"id":"19348208","text":"Augusto Petr√≥ (May 3, 1918 ‚Äì October 28, 2008) was a Brazilian bishop of the Roman Catholic Church and was one of oldest bishops in the Catholic Church and one of oldest Brazilian bishops.

(Philo D.) Beckwith (1835‚Äì1889) was the founder of Round Oak Stove Company (later officially known as the Estate of P.D. Beckwith Inc.) and Mayor of Dowagiac, Michigan. Born in 1835 in New York City, Philo D. Beckwith settled in Dowagiac, Michigan in 1854 and opened a foundry. His experiments with heating stoves in the 1860s led to the reshaping of his foundry business from the roller grain drill to the heating stove. Beckwith cast his first stove around 1867 to heat his struggling foundry and shortly after, the Michigan Central Railroad ordered the heaters for its depots between Detroit and Chicago. By 1871, Beckwith had made heating stoves his primary product (though he would continue manufacturing grain drills until his death) and the Round Oak Stove Company was born. Beckwith's company provided relatively high wages for the times and the, then, nearly unheard of benefit of sick pay. The town was, as a result, relatively insulated from the labor struggles occurring in the larger cities at the time. Beckwith, was a committed freethinker who wanted to \\"make the townsfolk aware and appreciative of those his personal pantheon of heroes and heroines whom he considered to be the true benefactors of the human race\\".1 The theater busts included (extraordinary for the times) women and freethinkers such as Thomas Paine, Robert Ingersoll, Walt Whitman, Victor Hugo, George Sand and Voltaire among others.2 The company expanded and Beckwith became a very popular man in town. He served as mayor for much of the 1880s and he invested a great deal of money and energy into various philanthropic activities. Beckwith died in January 1889 at the age of 54, leaving the management of the firm to his son-in-law, Fred E. Lee. Round Oak Stove Company officially became the Estate of P.D. Beckwith Incorporated after Beckwith‚Äôs death and continued expanding into the early 1900s. The company added new products, like furnaces and cooking stoves, and Round Oak produced a wide array of advertising materials. The success of the firm can be attributed to solid products and quality advertising. Round Oak stayed strong into the 1920s and survived the Great Depression, though greatly damaged. World War II government contracts helped the company stave off elimination, but once the war ended, Round Oak was a troubled company. In 1947, the company sold its buildings to Kaizer-Frazer for the production of automobile engine parts and the Round Oak name was sold to Peerless Furnace, which continued to make repair parts for furnaces and stoves. A Round Oak comeback in Dowagiac in the early 1950s was short lived and Round Oak was left to history. Today, Beckwith Estate or \\"Round Oak\\" Stoves are widely sought after collectibles. 1 Ingersoll: Immortal Infidel, ed. Roger E.

It was voted in referendum and presented to the Spanish Parliament. Yet, it could never be implemented because of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) and subsequent Francoist Spain (1939‚Äì1977). The 1936 statute was drafted by the Partido Galeguista (Galicianist Party), and it is the historical precedent of the current Statute of Autonomy of Galicia of 1981. ==Origins== Galician nationalists of the early 20th century, namely those around the Partido Galeguista, had considered a number of options regarding the relationship between Galicia and Spain, ranging from regional autonomy to total independence. During the Spanish Second Republic (1931‚Äì1939) a number of intellectuals proposed the formation of a federal State, where the different regions and nations of Spain could benefit from autonomy and decentralization.Castelao (1944): Sempre en Galiza, among others With that idea in mind, the Partido Galeguista, founded in 1931, promoted the development of a Galician Statute of Autonomy, based on the old Galicianist ideals and the modern Galician nationalism. ==Drafting the document== In 1931, shortly after the establishment of the Spanish Second Republic, the Seminario de Estudos Galegos (Galician Studies Seminar) presented an early draft for a Statute of Autonomy. The draft had been prepared by Valent√≠n Paz Andrade, Lois Tob√≠o Fern√°ndez, Ricardo Carballo Calero and Vicente Risco,.Henrique Monteagudo: Obras [Castelao], tomo 2, p√°x. 117, Editorial Galaxia, 1¬™ ed. 2000. It stated: Building on that, a more elaborated draft arrived in 1932, when the Mayor of Santiago de Compostela, Raimundo L√≥pez Pol, called for a meeting of all the Galician municipalities to discuss the text. That first meeting took place in Compostela on July 3. The editing committee was composed by Manuel Lugr√≠s, Alexandre B√≥veda and Salvador Cabeza de Le√≥n. They wrote a Statute containing 49 articles. It was divided in six parts: 1) Prologue; 2) Regional powers; 3) Faculties and abilities of the region; 4) Regional tax and revenue; 5) General remarks; 6) Temporary dispositions. This project defined Galicia as a democratic autonomous region within the Spanish State, with the aspiration of transforming the State into a federal republic. It established both Galician and Spanish as official languages. Most significantly, it granted the Galician government a number of powers, including the financial system (management and control of taxes and the economy), with the possibility to nationalize.Hooper (1986) It also established the functioning of the Parliament, the electoral system, and the role and functions of the President of Galicia.Enciclopedia Galega Universal, Ir Indo Edici√≥ns. ==Ratification== Between 17 and 19 December 1932, the final text was submitted to the vote. It obtained the support of 77 per cent of the Galician municipal representatives, counting for 84.7 per cent of the population. However, political instability postponed the ratification of the Statute by the Spanish government. Following the victory of the Frente Popular (Popular Front) in the February 1936 elections, the Galicianists could proceed again with their project. Yet, the fact that a number of members of the Partido Galeguista had joined the Frente Popular for the elections provoked internal tensions, namely from the right- wing members, who left the party. Nonetheless, they would still support the Statute and ask for a \\"yes\\" vote in the referendum to come. The campaign for the Statute referendum was intense and, finally, on 28 June 1936, Galicians were called to general vote. The turnout was 74.56 per cent (a very high figure for that time), with 993,351 votes in favour and 6,161 against.According to Hooper (1986:246): \\"the turnout was almost 75 per cent and of those who voted more than 99 per cent voted 'yes'\\" On 15 July 1936 G√≥mez Rom√°n, secretary of the Partido Galeguista, and Castelao, member of the Spanish Parliament for the Partido Galeguista/Frente Popular, submitted the Galician Statute of Autonomy to the Spanish Parliament. However, the start of the Civil War delayed the process. The Republican Parliament, based in Catalonia because of the War, eventually discussed the Statute on 1 February 1938. The Statute was only officially passed in 1945 by a Republican parliamentary commission in exile, namely in Mexico. That is to say, it was a symbolic gesture since the Statute could never be implemented. ==Legacy== The 1936 Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, although never implemented, was a fundamental piece of legislation for the future of Galicia. With the end of Francoist Spain (1977) and subsequent Spanish transition to democracy and passing of the Spanish Constitution (1978), a process of devolution took place in Spain. Galicia gained the rank of pre-autonomous community in 1979, achieving full status in 1981 with the passing of the current Statute of Autonomy. In other words, the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia of 1981 is seen as many as the heir of the 1936 text. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Cores Trasmonte, B.

But as \\"a poet, a gentle satirist and a humorist of the highest order, he achieved notability\\" in his short life for a series of newspaper published poems. ==Rise to fame== King billed himself as \\"Ben King, the Sweet Singer of St. Joe,\\" and first came to prominence for a concert given during the World's Columbian Exposition.

After the premature death of their father, the brothers were raised by their maternal uncle Jakob Adami in Frankfurt am Main. While the brothers Johann Philipp and Simon Moritz established the Gebr√ºder Bethmann bank based on their uncle's inheritance, Johann Jakob moved to Bordeaux in 1740, where he established Bethmann & Imbert (since 1779 Bethmann & fils) as a trading enterprise and shipowning company. In 1745 Bethmann married the Protestant Elisabeth Desclaux (1725‚Äì1785), a Bordeaux native. In 1749 he took Swiss citizenship and in 1758 he became a citizen of Frankfurt am Main.His descendants held fast to the Frankfurt citizenship, down to and including his great-grandson, Alexandre de Bethmann (mayor of Bordeaux from 1867 to 1870) as late as 1841. Source: Weber, p.194, citing Henninger In 1768 he was appointed imperial consul for Bordeaux, and in 1776 he was knighted. Bethmann proved an astute businessman and prospered quickly. Besides trading in goods and merchandise, he was not averse to an engagement in the slave trade and had already secured a guaranty worth 300,000 livres from his brothers in Frankfurt for that purpose before the plan for a joint venture with the Danish West India and Guinea Company was aborted due to business uncertainty.Weber, p.198, citing Henninger. He left his daughter Katharina Elisabeth (1753‚Äì1813) in the care of his childless brother Simon Moritz in Frankfurt. There she married in 1769 the merchant Peter Heinrich Metzler (1744‚Äì1800), who thenceforth used the surname Bethmann-Metzler (subsequently von Bethmann-Metzler or de Bethmann-Metzler) but remained in Frankfurt as a partner in the bank. After Johann Jakob's death in Bordeaux, his Frankfurt grandchildren returned to the city.

Named for politician and property developer Sir John Rogerson (1648‚Äì1724), the quay was formerly part of Dublin Port. It has some of the few remaining campshire warehouses in Dublin. ==Construction and use== Renovated diving bell (c.1866) on Sir John Rogersons Quay In 1713, Dublin Corporation leased lands on the Liffey to Sir John Rogerson, who was a developer and had been Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1693 to 1694. The lease of 133 acres on the south bank of the river (described as 'betwixt Lazy Hill and Ringsend') was conditional on Rogerson constructing a quay on the land. As part of the privately funded development, a quay wall was built facing the river, with a second wall built further inland. The gap between these walls was filled with sand and gravel dredged from the Liffey. The project commenced in 1716, with the initial phase completed by the early 1720s. John Rocque's 1756 map of Dublin shows Rogerson's quay as largely developed by the mid-18th century. During the early 19th century, the quay serviced larger freight vessels, including colliers which brought coal (from ports like Whitehaven in England) to feed the coal and gas works at nearby Hanover Quay. By the 20th century, Sir John Rogerson's Quay was home to a number of shipbuilding and shipping companies, as well as several storehouse types, including cold stores and 'campshire' sheds. At the beginning of the \\"Lotus-Eaters\\" episode of James Joyce's Ulysses, set in 1904, Leopold Bloom, one of the novel's protagonists, walks along Rogerson's Quay. Joyce describes it at the time as busy with lorry traffic, and notes some of the businesses along it‚Äîa linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office, and a sailor's home. ==Modern-day== Admiral William Brown on the quay As of the early 21st century, the previously functional maritime buildings and features of Sir John Rogerson's Quay have been redeveloped for heritage tourism, and newer office buildings built on the quay. This has included redevelopment of the quay's 'campshire' warehouses (associated with the historical use of the quay as a military 'camp'), and the renovation of a mid-19th century diving bell made by Grendons of Drogheda. The diving bell has been a feature of the quays since the 1870s, and was used to build and maintain many of the walls of Dublin's quays. ==References Category:Quays in Dublin (city) Category:Dublin Docklands ","title":"Sir John Rogerson's Quay"},{"id":"19348462","text":"Ellwood Watson Godfrey (July 17, 1910 - June 10, 1990) was an American field hockey player who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Martin Hjelmen was its first leader until Asbj√∏rn Sunde took over in 1938.Uklart om likvidasjoner ==Origin of name== Historian Lars Borgersrud says about the origins of the group's name, that \\"The Norwegian section of Wollweber's sabotage instrument was called 'the Osvald Group' (¬´Osvald-gruppa¬ª) after the pseudonym of the leader, Martin Hjelmen\\"‚ÄîOsvald. Osvald was also one of the pseudonyms used by Asbj√∏rn Sunde. ==History== After the arrest of Ernst Wollweber and the revelation of the Wollweber League, the Osvald Group was intact in Oslo, but had lost contact with Moscow, and had no funding. The group stored explosives around the country. They initiated their sabotage activities shortly after Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, and continued until the Osvald Group was demobilised in 1944, by orders from Moscow. Their first railway sabotage mission was undertaken on 20 July 1941, the explosion of a Wehrmacht train at Nyland Station in Oslo. In July 1942 Sunde held his first sabotage course at Rukkedalen (where they had their headquarters)].Glemte sabot√∏rer . LO-Aktuelt nr. 11/2009 \\"A short time later he actioned against German friendly\\" companies in Hadeland. The Osvald group's active resistance policy was in opposition to the Communist Party of Norway (NKP), Milorg and other organizations that preferred a more passive resistance. The group cooperated with the group 2A and 2A's police group, as well as with Milorg, SOE and XU. From the winter of 1942 NKP formed military groups, and Sunde had meetings with their leader Peder Furubotn. Sunde established a sabotage training center in Rukkedalen and recruited a network of saboteurs in the Torpo-Gol and Nesbyen area‚Äîand through Hallingdal and towards Oslo and Bergen. In September 1942 Sunde agreed to supply guards at the communist party's central camp in Hemsedal, in exchange for practical and financial support. Sunde became NKP's military leader, and the organisation became more efficient. In 1944 there was a break between the group and NKP's leader Peder Furubotn, when Furubotn demanded that the group should subordinate itself to his leadership. The Osvald Group was closed down in 1944, following orders from Moscow. During its operative period from July 1941 to July 1944 the group was responsible for around 110 known actions, dominating sabotage activity in Norway during this period. 35 of the saboteurs were killed, excluding the one killed in Bergen. Continued resistance by Saborg after summer of 1944 After the decommissioning of the Osvald Group, Saborg continued. (\\"Saborg was originally created and developed as the Bergen chapter of the international ship sabotage organization under Ernst Wollweber's leadership. This happened before World War Two\\".) In November and December 1944 the leaders of Saborg were arrested.Kristen, krigshelt og sosialdemokrat Saborg was the only resistance organization, that at times was subordinate to Milorg in Bergen, SOE, or the Communist Party's section inSaborgs historie m√• skrives Bergen. (The latter relationship lasted a few days until Saborg was destroyed, and it is regarded as insignificant, according to Borgersrud.) Violent actions *2 February 1942 saw the first, active event of Resistance [against the German occupation of Norway] when the √òstbanehallen (at present-day Oslo Central Station) was blown up to protest the inauguration of ministerpresident Vidkun Quisling. *On 21 August 1942 Statspolitiet's office was attacked.Christensen, 2006: p. 115 (This was a result of Hans Eng not showing up on 20 August, at a place were the group had prepared to assassinate him.Christensen, 2006: p. 114) *On 20 April 1943 it sabotaged an employment office in Oslo, on Pilestredet. (This sabotage has been confused with a planned attack against the employment office in Heimdal Street‚Äîto be led by Kai Holst; and a 1944 attack at Pilestredet by Max Manus.) *On 25 October 1944 a policeman in Stapo was assassinated in Bergen. (He was likely assassinated by Reidar Olsen, later arrested for that and a later assassination‚Äîand tortured to death by authorities.) *9 November 1944 a bank (Laksev√•g Sparebank) was robbed on behalf of the group The Saborg section of the Osvald Group was responsible for 30 actions. ==Organization== The number of members was over 200. \\"The communist sabotage organization in Bergen\\"Saborg i Bergen m√• sikres was called Saborg, and the core of the organization counted around 60-65 members. The V√•g√•rd Group (V√•g√•rdsgruppa) was another section of the Osvald Group, and it was based North of H√∏nefoss, in the forest. ==Post- war== Saboteur Josef Monsrud said that \\"I am proud of having been part of the Osvald organization. And the recognition that we have not received, I can [accept or] live with. Because I know what we have done\\", according to a 2009 LO-Aktuelt article.

Monument and plaquettes On 30 May 1995 a plaquette was installed on a wall of an atrium that leads to √òstbanehallen (from Jernbanetorget in Oslo), listing employees of the State Railways [whereof at least two were \\"Osvald members\\"] who died during World War II. In 2015 the plaquette was moved onto the base of the monument located at Jernbanetorget in Oslo. Other plaquettes are at other places in Norway. On 29 April 2015 a monument was installed at Jernbanetorget,Her kommer det omstridte Osvald-monumentet til Jernbanetorget and unveiled on 1 May.

The plan was endorsed by the Sixtieth World Health Assembly on May 23, 2007 because of several concerns. First, workers represent a significant contribution to the world's economic and social development. Furthermore, an international disparity between countries of occupational hazard prevention and access to occupational health services was observed. As such, the plan is grounded on both humanitarian and economically practical grounds.World Health Organization. Workers' health: global plan of action. Sixtieth World Health Assembly, May 23, 2007. Retrieved September 15, 2008. ==Workers' health: global plan of action== The plan of action deals with all aspects of workers' health, including primary prevention of occupational hazards, protection and promotion of health at work, employment conditions, and a better response from health systems to workers' health. It is underpinned by certain common principles. All workers should be able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and favorable working conditions. The workplace should not be detrimental to health and well-being. Primary prevention of occupational health hazards should be given priority. All components of health systems should be involved in an integrated response to the specific health needs of working populations. ==Objectives== The plan lists several actions for the \\"member states\\" that adopt it. Devise and implement policy instruments on workers' health Countries and member states should formulate their national policy frameworks to promote workers' health, strengthening their ministries of health, and integrating workers' health concerns into national health strategies. They also need to minimize the gaps between different groups of workers in terms of levels of risk and health status. High-risk economic sectors and vulnerable working populations, such as younger and older workers, need special consideration and protection. Protect and promote health at the workplace Member states should improve their health risk management. They must adopt basic occupational health standards and make certain that all workplaces comply with minimum requirements. They must work to promote health and prevent noncommunicable diseases in the workplace, in particular by advocating healthy diet and physical activity among workers, and promoting mental and family health at work. Additionally, the plan suggests that global health threats, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and avian influenza, can also be prevented and controlled at the workplace. Improve the performance of and access to occupational health services Member states can improve their coverage and quality of occupational health services by integrating their development into national health strategies, health-sector reforms and plans for improving health systems performance; determining standards for organization and coverage of occupational health services; setting targets for increasing the coverage of the working population with occupational health services; creating mechanisms for pooling resources and for financing the delivery of occupational health services; ensuring sufficient and competent human resources; and establishing quality assurance systems. Provide and communicate evidence for action and practice Member states must design systems for surveillance of workers' health. This includes establishing national information systems, building capability to estimate the occupational burden of diseases and injuries, creating registries of exposure to major risks, occupational accidents and occupational diseases, and improving reporting and early detection of such accidents and diseases. Also strategies and tools need to be elaborated for improving communication and raising awareness about workers' health. They should target workers, employers and their organizations, policy-makers, the general public, and the media. Incorporate workers' health into other policies Measures to protect workers' health should be incorporated in economic development policies and poverty reduction strategies. Employment policies should be designed to influence worker health. ==Implementation== The plan suggests that improving the health of workers can be achieved through well-coordinated efforts of society as a whole, under government leadership and with substantial participation of workers and employers. WHO and its partners express in the plan an intention to work with the member states to promote partnership and joint action with ILO and other organizations of the United Nations system, organizations of employers, trade unions, and other stakeholders in civil society and the private sector in order to strengthen international efforts on workers' health. Also to implement the plan the WHO expects to provide guidelines, promote and monitor their use, and contribute to the adoption and implementation of international labor conventions. The plan of action will be reviewed and monitored using a set of national and international indicators of achievement. == References == Category:World Health Organization ","title":"WHO global plan of action for workers' health"},{"id":"19348510","text":"The campshires are the stretches of land between the quay and road on both the north and south quays in Dublin.

When he was four years old his father moved the firm to 50 Albemarle Street, which became a meeting-place for men of letters. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Edinburgh University, where he graduated in 1827. He completed his education by foreign travel, in Weimar delivering the dedication of Lord Byron's Marino Faliero to Goethe. ==Publisher== There resulted the research for a series of books for tourists, the Murray's Handbooks for Travellers. In 1836 Murray saw through the press the first of the handbooks, his own Holland, Belgium, and the Rhine; and three more were written by himself. Subsequently, he enlisted specialists: Richard Ford (A Handbook for Travellers in Spain), Sir Gardner Wilkinson (Egypt), and Sir Francis Palgrave (North Italy). From 1830 to 1843 Murray helped his father run the firm. His own publishing projects included: *Nineveh and its Remains (1848), publicising of Austen Henry Layard's discoveries; *Lord Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors (1845‚Äì48), and Lives of the Chief Justices (1849); *George Grote's History of Greece (1846‚Äì55); *Murray's British Classics, annotated library editions of Byron, Gibbon, Goldsmith, and other writers; and *the series of dictionaries by William Smith, an adviser of the firm who became editor of the Quarterly Review in 1867. Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published by Murray in 1859. An enterprise of a different kind was The Speaker's Commentary (1871‚Äì81), prompted by John Evelyn Denison.

David manages to escape from custody. On the run, he arrives at the home of a couple living in an isolated farmhouse (Marl√®ne Jobert and Philippe Noiret). He claims that he is in possession of an important secret, one that he came across by chance, that is so terrible that the authorities will do anything to protect it. He predicts, correctly, that the state will soon mobilize all its resources to find him, using as a cover story the claim that a paranoid killer is on the loose from an asylum. The couple are unsure whether to believe him, but give him some assistance. Whether David is an unlucky but innocent fugitive or is the psychopath described by the police and press remains a mystery until the last moment of the film. ==Other== √âtienne Becker is the Director of Photography. ==External links== * Category:1974 films Category:French films Category:French thriller films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:1970s thriller drama films Category:Films about conspiracy theories Category:Films directed by Robert Enrico Category:1974 drama films ","title":"The Secret (1974 film)"},{"id":"19348615","text":"Simon Vaughn Thomas (born 21 July 1984) is an English footballer who plays as a striker.Town sign new striker‚Äö Enfield Town FC, June 2017 ==Career== Thomas spent two years at Boreham Wood, helping them to avoid relegation.

Originally known as Great Britain Quay, the quay was built in the 1790s as part of the opening of Grand Canal Dock. The quay was widened in the mid-19th century, with works undertaken to dredge and deepen the riverbed alongside the quay wall in the 1870s. In 1873, Great Britain Quay was recorded as being in length. Part of the working Dublin Port facilities for several hundred years, the quay was a docking point for coal carrying cargo vessels, and the site of a number of industrial buildings ‚Äì including a chemical works which was destroyed by fire in the early 20th century. By this time the quay's structures also included a navigation \\"hailing station\\" at the junction with Sir John Rogerson's Quay. A time ball sat on top of this station which, when operated remotely from Dunsink Observatory, signaled that it was 1pm. In the early 21st century this station, by then a protected structure, was demolished by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. This demolition occurred as part of development works at the corner between Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Britain Quay in preparation for the construction of the U2 Tower, which would have been Ireland's tallest building. That project was later scrapped in the economic downturn, and ultimately Capital Dock was erected on the site (Ireland's tallest building on its completion in 2018). Remaining buildings on the Record of Protected Structures on Britain Quay include a former lock keeper's cottage and the three nearby canal locks which separate Grand Canal Dock from the River Liffey. These three locks, named Westmoreland Lock, Buckingham Lock, and Camden Lock, were built in 1796. A public transport bridge (carrying pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport only) had been proposed to connect Britain Quay to York Quay across the River Dodder. As of early 2018, the proposed bridge (described in planning documents under the interim project name of the \\"Dodder Public Transportation Opening Bridge\\") was in an initial public consultation phase. ==References== Category:Quays in Dublin (city) Category:Dublin Docklands Category:Ringsend ","title":"Britain Quay"},{"id":"19348642","text":"Alberto Alberani Samaritani (born 22 May 1947) is a retired Italian water polo goalkeeper.

It was syndicated by United Feature Syndicate from May 31, 1954 to December 29, 1962. The strip was initially written by Capp, who soon turned the duties over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Lubbers eventually assumed the writing duties himself in the strip's last few years. ==Characters and story== Long Sam was, like Li'l Abner, a hillbilly strip, though based on a female character. The title character, Sam, was a tall, voluptuous, naive mountain girl who had been raised in a hidden valley away from civilization by her Maw, who hates men and wishes to protect her daughter from them. Comics historian Don Markstein detailed the situations and characters: :Accounts differ as to exactly when United Feature began syndicating Long Sam. The best information indicates it was Monday, May 31, 1954, but other sources say it was Sunday, June 6, or Monday, June 7, of that year. Sam was similar to an earlier Capp character, Cynthia Hound-Baskerville, aka Strange Gal, who had emerged from the Great Swamp near Abner's Dogpatch to participate in the 1938 Sadie Hawkins Day race. Like Strange Gal, Long Sam was raised in isolation, by a man-hating Maw; and like Strange Gal, Long Sam was irrevocably changed when she did come into contact with civilization. The first story concerned the outside world's discovery of the remote, uncharted valley where Sam and Maw lived; and consequently, Sam's discovery of the outside world, which Maw had assured her did not exist. Maw's strategy immediately backfired‚Äîinstead of protecting Sam from the wiles of men, her lack of experience had rendered her exceptionally vulnerable to their charms. Throughout the strip's run, Sam would alternate between visits with Maw in her valley, and excursions outside; and a recurring schtick was that when outside, Sam would usually fall in love with the first man she met.Long Sam at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on November 16, 2015. The strip is considered an example of good girl art, and Lubbers was chosen as the artist for his facility with attractive females in the syndicated Tarzan strip. In 1956, Long Sam featured the lyrics to a song, \\"Lonesome and Disgusted\\", which had a promotional tie-in when Coral Records issued a recording of the song by Capp and Lubbers with music by Dave Lambert. The vocalist on the recording was the comedian and voice actor Leo De Lyon.Crow, Bill.

He held meetings there with his friends, and these became a formalised group towards the end of the year, founded by him with fellow Camden Town Group members, Charles Ginner and Harold Gilman, who began to work with the style called Neo-Realism. They defined what they did as exploring the shapes and colours of daily life (in particular those of north- west London), while also paying attention to their proper disposition compositionally and maintaining sensitivity to the medium of paint itself as key to an expressive image; the strong emphasis on natural observation was a differentiation from the Camden Town Group.\\"Cumberland Market Group\\", Grove Art Online (subscription).

The band's debut album, Collected Memories, was released on 5 May 2008. ==History== Greg Carlin Carlin grew up in Midrand, a suburb outside Johannesburg, South Africa where he attended Irene Primary School before progressing to high school at Midrand High School, which he graduated from in 1999. Carlin first realised his passion for music after receiving a drum kit as a gift at the age of twelve. While at school, Carlin played in a short-lived band called MSG (1997‚Äì1999) ‚Äì the name of an additive found in food products they took off a chip packet. After school, he went on to study Fine Arts at South African university Tuks from 2001‚Äì2004, and also completed his honours degree, though he did not pursue fine art further. During his time at university, Carlin took singing lessons for several months and bought tutorial CDs from the US. While at university, Carlin was the bassist and vocalist for the band White Lie (2004‚Äì2005), a side project of the punk band Remedy. In spite of a radio hit called \\"Runaway\\", the band's run was brief and they broke up because the other band members wanted to focus on their university studies, the band was going nowhere anyway, so Greg called it a day. After varsity, Carlin decided to travel and on his return worked intermittently as a contractor at Standard Bank during 2005 to 2007. He taught himself the guitar (his favourite instrument), as well as piano/keyboard, bass and drums (the only instrument he was ever trained in). Carlin was, for a while, an employee of record label, Just Music, where he handled the digital side of the business. He approached the head of the label, Karl Anderson, with a demo of his work and was offered a record deal. Collected Memories and The Knife EP Carlin produced the band's debut album, Collected Memories, with Darryl Torr from Dear Reader & Harris Tweed. The album was released on 5 May 2008. Nils van der Linden of Iafrica.com described the album as \\"the kind of slick but dark electro rock you'd expect a fan of New Order and Joy Division to make\\". \\"The Knife\\" was chosen as the album's first single, and Carlin enlisted South African cinematographer Rob Malpage and producer Warwick Allan to make the music video. Warwick had a concept for the video, but had not heard the song; they soon got together and adapted the concept to suit the song. The Knife was #1 for 3 weeks on the Hi5@5 on 5FM and was also #1 for 5 weeks on the PUKFM charts. It went to #1 on other South African campus stations. The video was #1 for a couple of weeks on the MK Top10 music videos in South Africa. The release of the album and the national success of \\"The Knife\\" meant the band were \\"causing quite a stir\\" according to Music Industry Online. At this point, Carlin needed to find additional members in order to enable the band to perform live. Though he was reluctant to assemble a touring group, he recruited Alan Shenton (guitar), Andrew Maskell (bass), Rob Davidson (keyboards) and Darren Leader (drums). \\"Arm Yourself\\", the second single from Collected Memories, as well as its music video (again directed by Allan) was released in August 2008. The third single released by Z&G; is the hit \\"Oxymoron,\\" for which an HD stop motion video was shot by the bands still photographer, Marcus Maschwitz and directed & edited by band members, Greg Carlin and Alan Shenton. In January 2009 they released \\"Running Faster,\\" followed by \\"In My Eyes,\\" \\"Fight! Fight! Fight!\\" and \\"Pariahs.\\" In total, 'Collected Memories' produced 7 Top 10 singles and achieved numerous # 1's on the biggest National and College Radio stations around South Africa. In May 2010, Zebra & Giraffe launched their first International release ‚Äì a 5 Track EP called 'The Knife'. The EP, which features selected tracks from their debut 'Collected Memories', was mixed in London at Metropolis Studios by the acclaimed producer / mixer Cenzo Townshend. Townshend is famous for his work with bands like Editors, Florence and The Machine, Snow Patrol and U2. 'The Knife' EP includes the singles ‚Äì 'Oxymoron', (mixed by Ken Lewis) 'The Knife', 'In My Eyes', 'Arm Yourself' and 'Fight! Fight! Fight!‚Äô, and was released internationally in May 2010. The Inside Zebra & Giraffe released their 2nd LP in South Africa on 27 September 2010. Production began on this album in May of the same year. The majority of the album was recorded at RBF Studios in Johannesburg. The album was once again produced by Darryl Torr, and this time around mixed by Cenzo Townshend. Three different versions of the album will be released on the same date. A standard edition, a deluxe edition with a DVD documentary on the 'making of The Inside' album & video, and a 3rd edition with the Knife EP attached, also mixed by Cenzo Townshend. The album was written by Greg Carlin, Alan Shenton, and Darren Leader. Once again, Warwick Allan was recruited to direct & edit a video for the title track \\"The Inside.\\" The supported the release of \\"The Inside\\" around South Africa in October 2010. They visited: Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Bloemfontein, East London, Port Elizabeth, Grahamstown, Knysna, Stellenbosch, and finished up in Cape Town. The Wisest Ones In November 2011, Zebra & Giraffe went into studio as a three-piece (Greg Carlin, Alan Shenton, Mike Wright) with Grammy Award-winning producer-engineer Darryl Torr at his recording facility in Greenside, Johannesburg.

It was released in November 2008 in Europe. It was also released in North America in early 2009. The album features three CDs containing selected songs from all Ayreon albums, and a DVD featuring live performances, video clips and behind-the-scenes. The third CD also features a song, called \\"Epilogue: The Memory Remains\\", specifically written for the release, which provides further insight into the final chapter of the Ayreon concept and the probable future of its characters. Jasper Steverlinck, singer of Arid, made a guest appearance as the vocalist of the song. He would later be invited by Arjen to sing on his new side project Guilt Machine. Many songs were remastered for this release. Apart from the CDs and DVD, a timeline poster illustrating the Ayreon universe and a booklet containing new photos, lyrics, and notes on the story are also available in the Timeline package. == Background == Arjen A. Lucassen said that he hasn't released a compilation album before because he didn't want to reunite random chapters of a whole history in a single album. However, after connecting all other Ayreon releases in the album 01011001, he changed his mind and decided to create the album, which can be described as a timeline outlining the entire story. As the album will feature a summarized version of Ayreon's concept, one can deduce that the concept has come to an end. Therefore, concerning Ayreon's future, Arjen stated: \\"I don't see this as the end of Ayreon, but rather as a new beginning. I'll definitely be recording some side projects before I even start thinking about re-inventing Ayreon. To keep things fresh for myself I've got to come up with a completely new concept for both the music and the lyrics. I hope I can do it...it will definitely be quite a challenge!\\"Timeline: New Ayreon compilation album - News at Arjen's official website == Epilogue: The Memory Remains == The brand new track, \\"Epilogue: The Memory Remains\\", adds further detail to the fate of the Forever alien race and the New Migrator, the soul of the Mars Colonist. After the last human dies, his spirit becomes the new Universal Migrator and begins traveling along the original Migrator Trail. As it does, it passes by Planet Y and breathes new life into its dormant, immortal race, rekindling their emotions as it does. The saga ends with mankind's brief existence serving a purpose after all. == Track listing ==  CD 1  1995: The Final Experiment # Prologue - 3:17 # The Awareness - 6:36 # Eyes of Time - 5:05 # The Accusation (acoustic version taken from the Special Edition) - 3:43 # Sail Away to Avalon (single version) - 3:40 # Listen to the Waves - 4:40 1996: Actual Fantasy (Revisited) # * Actual Fantasy - 1:31 # Abbey of Synn - 9:25 # Computer Eyes - 7:17 # Back on Planet Earth - 7:04 1998: Into the Electric Castle # * Isis and Osiris - 11:09 # Amazing Flight - 10:21  CD 2  1998: Into the Electric Castle # The Garden of Emotions - 9:40 # The Castle Hall - 5:48 # The Mirror Maze - 6:23 # The Two Gates - 6:23 2000: The Universal Migrator parts I and II # * The Shooting Company of Captain Frans B Cocq - 7:42 # Dawn of a Million Souls - 7:44 # And the Druids Turned to Stone - 6:32 # Into the Black Hole - 10:17 # The First Man on Earth - 6:54 2004: The Human Equation # * Day Two: Isolation 8:46  CD 3  2004: The Human Equation # Day Three: Pain 4:53 # Day Six: Childhood 5:04 # Day Twelve: Trauma 9:23 # Day Sixteen: Loser 4:47 # Day Seventeen: Accident? 5:41 2008: 01011001 # * Age of Shadows (edit) - 5:39 # Ride the Comet - 3:39 # The Fifth Extinction - 10:27 # Waking Dreams - 6:23 # The Sixth Extinction - 12:16 2008: New previously unreleased Ayreon track # * Epilogue: The Memory Remains - 9:16  DVD  # The Stranger from Within (5.1, available on Actual Fantasy Revisited) # Valley of the Queens (available on Star One ‚Äì Live on Earth) # Isis and Osiris (available on Star One ‚Äì Live on Earth) # The Two Gates (available on Star One ‚Äì Live on Earth) # Teaser: The Human Equation (available on the special edition of The Human Equation) # Day Eleven: Love (5.1, available on the special edition of The Human Equation) # Come Back to Me (available as CD ROM track on the EP Come Back to Me) # Loser (Star One version, previously unreleased) # Farside of the World (5.1, available on Actual Fantasy Revisited) # Back on Planet Earth (5.1, available on Actual Fantasy Revisited) # Featurette Actual Fantasy (available on Actual Fantasy Revisited) # Computer Eyes (available on Stream of Passion ‚Äì Live in the Real World) # Day One: Vigil (available on Stream of Passion ‚Äì Live in the Real World) # Day Three: Pain (available on Stream of Passion ‚Äì Live in the Real World) # The Castle Hall (available on Stream of Passion ‚Äì Live in the Real World) # Release Party 01011001 (previously unreleased) # Beneath the Waves (5.1, available on the special edition of 01011001) # Teaser 01011001 (available on the special edition of 01011001) # Featurette Epilogue: The Memory Remains (previously unreleased) == References == * Timeline page at Arjen's official website Category:Ayreon compilation albums Category:2008 compilation albums Category:2008 video albums Category:Music video compilation albums Category:Live video albums Category:Inside Out Music live albums Category:Inside Out Music compilation albums Category:Inside Out Music video albums ","title":"Timeline (Ayreon album)"},{"id":"19348777","text":"Harvey Dow Gibson in 1917 Harvey Dow Gibson (March 12, 1882 ‚Äì September 11, 1950) was an American businessman. ==Early life== Harvey Dow Gibson was born on March 12, 1882 at North Conway in Carroll County, New Hampshire.

The city of Haroonabad is the headquarters of the tehsil which is administratively subdivided into 22 Union Councils.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Bahawalnagar - Government of Pakistan ==History== Under the Punjab Local Government Act 2013, the Tehsil Municipal Administration for Haroonabad was converted into a Municipal Committee for the city of Haroonabad. In 2017, the Hindu community of the area was asked to vacate their houses by local administration, allegedly due to pressure from the owners of a housing scheme who intended to demolish these homes. A protest was held in response urging the Punjab government to take action. The Hindu community has lived in the area for about 30 years since the commissioner of Bahawalnagar District allowed them to construct homes on government land in 1987. The Hindu community managed to obtain a stay order from the Punjab government against the notices to vacate their houses. ==Geography== Haroonabad Tehsil has an area of 1,295 km2.

There are two sessions collected on the album with largely different musicians. The first 1953 session is \\"Compulsion\\", \\"The Serpent's Tooth\\" (two takes) and \\"'Round About Midnight\\".January 30, 1953 Session Details, Miles Ahead: A Miles Davis Website, accessed July 4, 2014 The second 1956 session is \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\", \\"Vierd Blues\\" and \\"No Line\\".March 16, 1956 Session Details, Miles Ahead: A Miles Davis Website, accessed July 4, 2014 The personnel for the first session were Davis, Sonny Rollins and Charlie Parker (credited under the pseudonym \\"Charlie Chan\\" due to his contractual obligations to a rival label) on tenor saxes, Walter Bishop on piano, Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. For the second session, the tenor sax was Rollins alone, the piano was Tommy Flanagan, the bass Paul Chambers and Art Taylor on drums. According to Ira Gitler's liner notes, the 1953 session was only the second time Parker had recorded on a tenor sax. According to the CD edition's liner notes, that session was the only time Parker and Rollins recorded together. Davis describes the session with Parker in his autobiography as having been very chaotic. It was Davis' first session of 1953 and his heroin habit had gotten very bad. Parker had quit his own heroin habit following the arrest of his trumpet player Red Rodney, instead drinking enormous quantities of alcohol. He consumed a quart of vodka at the rehearsal, then spoke condescendingly to Davis as if it were his session and Davis an employee or a child. After arguing, Parker fell asleep and Davis was so mad he played poorly, which in turn angered Gitler who was producing.\\"Miles: the Autobiography\\", Miles Davis with Quincy Troupe, 1989, pg.161 The 1953 session was considered incomplete and remained unreleased. After having signed to Columbia Records in 1956, part of Davis' contractual obligation to Prestige was to complete another half session considered owed, which resulted in the second half of this album.\\"Miles: the Autobiography\\", Miles Davis with Quincy Troupe, 1989, pg.203 Parker was also billed as \\"Charlie Chan\\" on the 1953 album Jazz at Massey Hall. Also for Parker, this album represented a posthumous release, since it was released a year after his death, in New York City in March 1955. ==Track listing== Prestige ‚Äì PRLP7044: ==Personnel== January 30, 1953 session *Miles Davis ‚Äì Trumpet *Sonny Rollins ‚Äì Tenor Saxophone *Charlie Parker (\\"Charlie Chan\\") ‚Äì Tenor Saxophone *Walter Bishop ‚Äì Piano *Percy Heath ‚Äì Bass *Philly Joe Jones ‚Äì Drums March 16, 1956 session *Miles Davis ‚Äì Trumpet *Sonny Rollins ‚Äì Tenor Saxophone *Tommy Flanagan ‚Äì Piano *Paul Chambers ‚Äì Bass *Art Taylor ‚Äì Drums ==References== Category:Miles Davis albums Category:Prestige Records albums Category:1956 albums Category:Original Jazz Classics albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Weinstock Category:Albums produced by Ira Gitler Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ","title":"Collectors' Items"},{"id":"19348905","text":"Main entry to the abbey Szczyrzyc Abbey () is a Cistercian abbey founded in 1234 in the village of Szczyrzyc, Poland.

The characters are a pair of furry extraterrestrial twins from the planet Zog. They made their television d√©but on 22 September 1987 on RT√â's Dempsey's Den. Two years later they won a Jacob's Award for TV Personalities of the year. In 1992 Zig and Zag found fame in the UK when they joined the team of the Channel 4 breakfast show The Big Breakfast. During the 1990s the characters spawned a merchandising range of comic books, videos and embarked on a recording career ‚Äì scoring a UK top-five single with \\"Them Girls Them Girls\\". In 2010 the characters saw a resurgence in their popularity as they joined the Big Brother's Little Brother team and in October 2010 they were commissioned to host a flagship Saturday morning radio show on 2FM called Smells Like Saturday. A brand new TV bloopers show hosted by Zig and Zag entitled Zig & Zag's Superbloopers was announced on the RT√â TV website. In April 2015, it was announced that the duo would return in 2016 with a 26 episode animated series commissioned by RT√â and the BBC. ==Characters== Zig and Zag's full names are Zigmund Ambrose Zogly and Zagnatius Hillary ZoglyAs confirmed on RT√â 2fm's The Will Leahy Show in late 2008. Podcast may be available here . and claim they were born 29 February 1971 on Zog. Zig is beige (although he claimed to be fawn) with red \\"zogabongs\\" (pom-pom antennae) and a tuft of green hair, and Zag is purple with green spots and yellow zogabongs and dreadlocks. In their original RT√â incarnation, Zig often came across as the more intelligent one, with Zag under his thumb (most evident in their \\"Story Time\\" segments, when Zig would read a nursery rhyme to the audience, and Zag would grudgingly act it out). Zag also displayed a penchant for cross-dressing and playing with Barbie dolls. However, after the two moved to Channel 4, Zag began to be portrayed as the more intelligent older brother, a lecherous lady-killer who claimed to fly every weekend to Hollywood to dine with the stars, as well as performing ragga songs in his guise of \\"Ragga Zagga\\". Zig was then portrayed as a weak-willed childish simpleton, constantly giggling at rude jokes (like the word \\"bottom\\"), obsessed with specific things (such as The Hunt for Red October or his rash) and frequently unaware of what was going on around him. Alter ego characters Zig and Zag frequently appeared dressed as other characters, in particular during their tenure on The Den. Such characters ranged from would-be distant relatives to superheroes. Captain Joke ‚Äì Zag's primary superhero identity, Captain Joke had no superpowers other than his ability to tell silly jokes. He wore a red mask on his eyes and matching cape and only Zig suspected his identity. Captain Pillowcase ‚Äì While Captain Joke's true identity was never discovered, Zig's first attempt at being a superhero was far less successful and was generally met with contempt. The character consisted of Zig wearing a pillowcase over his head. Captain Pillowcase's alleged special ability consisted of using his pillowcase to do impressions, such as his impression of Mount Everest or an ice cream cone melting. Captain Shamrock ‚Äì Zig's next superhero alter ego was far more successful. Captain Shamrock generally only made appearances on Saint Patrick's Day. He spoke with a strong American accent and, as such, was delivered as a satire on American tourists visiting Ireland to discover their roots. Captain Shamrock managed to convince the others that he was the primary authority on all things Irish, and would often tell nonsensical stories loosely based on Irish folklore. Cousin Nigel ‚Äì Zig and Zag's obnoxious, brattish cousin who would constantly complain about everything in a strong Birmingham accent. Cousin Nigel consisted of Zig wearing a pair of drinking glasses over his eyes and a Cub Scouts hat. Sunny Daze ‚Äì Another Zig alter ego, Sunny Daze was the star crooner at the Rotten Apple Club. ==Creators== Ciaran Morrison and Mick O'Hara provide the voices for Zig and for Zag, respectively. Their production company, Double Z Enterprises produced The Den when Zig and Zag featured. In 2003 they produced a TV series for Channel 4, The Bronx Bunny Show. They also regularly appear on RT√â Two in their current incarnations of Podge and Rodge, fellow characters from The Den with an unsavoury past but who are now reformed enough for RT√â to commission their own primetime chat show, The Podge and Rodge Show. Ciaran and Mick continue to work in development and as in-demand scriptwriters for a number of companies through their partnership Double Z. They have written on animation series such as Danger Mouse, Oddbods, Kiva Can Do, Claude, Space Chickens in Space, 101 Dalmatian Street, Transformers: Rescue Bots Academy to name but a few. ==TV work== When Ian Dempsey left the then titled Dempsey's Den in 1990, Zig and Zag remained on with his replacement Ray D'Arcy. Their alien dog, Zuppy, also featured on television at this time. Zuppy remained with The Den for some years after Zig and Zag left. After having worked on The Den for a number of years, Zig and Zag worked concurrently on The Big Breakfast, subsequently exiting The Den to work on the show exclusively. After their departure from RT√â, Dustin the Turkey took over with new character Soky. The brothers' decision to work for a UK-based broadcaster caused friction with their former Den colleagues, which led to Dustin later accusing them of 'selling out to the Queen' during a live, heated exchange on 2Phat's 1998 Christmas special.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP34VUZ3zFg On The Big Breakfast, the two acted as interviewers in the \\"crunch\\" segment of the show. Among the memorable results was them teaching Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man and Ol' Dirty Bastard \\"how to fold a serviette like a pineapple\\". \\"I did like them guys,\\" recalled ODB. \\"Anything to do with aliens is fine with Dirty.\\" During this time, they also starred in a series of adverts for Yoplait yogurts. Zig and Zag made an appearance on MTV Europe's MTV's Most Wanted, leading to their own MTV Europe sketch programme, The Zig and Zag Show. After a revamp of The Big Breakfast, they were dropped and produced a kids entertainment show, also entitled The Zig and Zag Show, for ITV. They then returned to Ireland to present the music quiz, 2Phat with Ray D'Arcy until 2001. They starred in a children's programme called Me:Tv for Nickelodeon UK and Ireland in the summer of 2006, the premise of which was kids used their own webcams to present the show. In 2010 they joined Big Brother's Little Brother team to interview past contestants. Zig and Zag returned to Irish TV screens with an hour-long Christmas special in 2011 entitled Zig and Zag's Superbloopers co-hosted by Aidan Power. The three returned for a six-part series of the blooper show broadcast on RT√â 1 in September 2012. A second Christmas special this time entitled Superfestivebloopers was produced and broadcast on Christmas Day 2013. In May 2012, Double Z Productions and Flickerpix announced they were gearing up to begin production over the summer for a new, 2D animated show to debut in 2015. The series is written by Zig and Zag creators Ciaran Morrison and Mick O'Hara who will also voice the characters. The series will be produced by Ronan McCabe for Double Z and David Cumming for Flickerpix. Joel Simon, creative director at Flickerpix, will direct the series. The first animated series (26 x 11mins) simply entitled Zig and Zag was broadcast on CBBC and RT√â in Spring 2016. Zig and Zag made a surprise guest appearance on TFI Friday on 18 December 2015 in what is most likely the last ever live episode of the show. They had previously appeared on the show during its first season in 1996. They joined Chris Evans for the Christmas Special and when Gaby Roslin appeared later in the show she stated that it was the first time all four former Big Breakfast presenters had been together on screen in 21 years. ==Filmography== * Dempsey's Den (RT√â) (1987‚Äì1990) * The Den (RT√â) (1990‚Äì1993) * The Big Breakfast (Channel 4) (1992‚Äì1998, 2002) * Entertainment Cops (1994) * The Zig and Zag Show (MTV) (1994‚Äì1995) * Dirty Deeds (Channel 4) (1996) * The Zig and Zag Show (ITV) (1998) * 2Phat (RT√â) (1998‚Äì2001) * Big Brother's Little Brother (Channel 4) (2010) * Zig & Zag's Superbloopers (RT√â) (2011‚Äì2013) * TFI Friday (Channel 4) (1996),(2015) Guests * Zig and Zag (CBBC, RT√â) (2016) ==Radio== * Smells Like Saturday (RT√â radio) (2010‚Äì2011) ==Merchandise== VHS/DVDs Zig and Zag were on presenting duty on RT√â One on Monday 27 October 2008 for a bank holiday broadcast. * 1988 ‚Äì Nothing to Do with Toast * 1992 ‚Äì The Best of The Big Breakfast * 1995 ‚Äì Million Quid Vid * 2008 ‚Äì Best Bitz from Back Den Music Zig and Zag's first single, \\"The Christmas No. 1\\" reached No. 1 in Ireland in 1990 at Christmas and stayed there for five weeks.

A box junction is a road traffic control measure designed to prevent congestion and gridlock at junctions. The surface of the junction is typically marked with a yellow criss-cross grid of diagonal painted lines (or only two lines crossing each other in the box), and vehicles may not enter the area so marked unless their exit from the junction is clear, or they are intending to turn and are prevented from doing so by oncoming traffic, or other vehicles on the box waiting to turn. Box junctions were introduced in the UK during 1967, following a successful trial in London.Motor Cycle, 23 March 1967, p.378 More Box Junctions . Accessed and added 2014-06-10 In both Ireland and the United Kingdom (where cars drive on the left), drivers may enter the box and wait when they want to turn right and are stopped from doing so only by oncoming traffic or by other vehicles waiting to turn right. Box junctions may be painted on other areas of roadway which must be kept free of queuing traffic, such as exits from emergency vehicle depots, level crossings and car parks. Box junctions are most widely used in many European countries such as Cyprus, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Serbia and the United Kingdom; in parts of the United States, such as New York and Colorado; and other countries, including Canada , Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines,\\"13.6: 'Do Not Block Intersection' lines\\", Highway Safety Design Standards, Part 2: Road Signs and Pavement Markings Manual, Philippines: Department of Public Works and Highways, p.127 South Africa , Taiwan and Brazil. == Unmarked equivalents== A sign used in Chile warning motorists not to block a box junction. In Australia, New Zealand and the European Union (excluding Ireland), road rules state that every intersection is a box: that is, the driver may not enter any intersection unless there is clear space on the other side, whether it is marked or not. In the EU this also applies to junctions with a minor road within the waiting area of a traffic light on the major road. This is generally respected, though rarely in Germany, but the diagonal grid is still painted on some congested intersections to remind drivers of the rule and on level crossings where blocking the intersection could cause an accident. The same rule applies at every intersection in Russia.Section 13.2 of traffic code Several U.S. states have enacted laws intending to decrease gridlock at intersections, railroad crossings, and marked crosswalks which prohibit motorists from entering any of the three until they are certain their vehicle can clear it, as recommended by Uniform Vehicle Code section 11-1112. Examples include California,California Vehicle Code Section 22526. Florida,Fla. Stat. Section 316.2061. and Ohio.Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.712. No special road markings are used to indicate this rule, but some governments post warning signs to increase awareness of the law at problematic intersections. ==References *How To Use Box Junctions Video Tutorial *2pass.co.uk tutorial.

The first evidence of his career comes in 1626, when he played Cardona, a woman's role, in James Shirley's The Wedding with Queen Henrietta's Men. Read appears to have spent the early 1630s with the King's Revels Men, but returned to the Queen Henrietta's company after the bubonic plague epidemic of 1636-37, when personnel of the two troupes combined. With the Queen's company, Read played Buzzard in Richard Brome's The English Moor,Matthew Steggle, Richard Brome: Place and Politics on the Caroline Stage, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2004; p. 121. perhaps in 1637. He won his fame as a dancer. Performances in English Renaissance theatre, even tragedies, ended with a clown dancing a jig, and Read was one of a long line of comics, reaching from Richard Tarlton through John Shank, who earned a large and welcoming audience through this practice. One of the best indices of Read's fame occurs in The Stage Player's Complaint, a pamphlet printed in 1641. The pamphlet presents the two leading comic actors of the day, Andrew Cane and Timothy Read, in a dialogue about the difficulties of the clowning life. (The summer of 1641 saw another theatre closure due to plague.) In the pamphlet, Cane, renowned for his clever repartee, is called Quick; Read, famous for his fast feet, is called Light. The text of the Complaint seems to indicate that Read was then a member of the King's Men, though scholars have disputed the point.G. E. Bentley, \\"Records of Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association, Vol. 44 No. 3 (September 1929), pp. 789-826; see p. 817. The Puritan authorities of London closed the theatres in 1642, at the start of the English Civil War; but the actors continued to perform, when and where they could. Read was among the players arrested on 6 October 1647, during a performance of Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King at the Salisbury Court Theatre. Read's end is mysterious; but his continuing fame is demonstrated by allusions to him, in works from his own and the next generation. In the Praeludium of The Careless Shepherdess (published 1656), one speaker says, ::I never saw Reade peeping through the curtain, ::But ravishing joy entered my heart.R. A. Foakes, \\"Playhouses and players,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to English Renaissance Drama, A. R. Braunmiller and Michael Hattaway, eds., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003: p. 45.

He played for the Travelers again in 1928, then he was signed by the Chicago Cubs organization, where he started the season with the Reading Keystones. == Major league career ==  Chicago Cubs  Grace made his major league debut for the Chicago Cubs in 1929, playing in 27 games and batting .250. After a season back in the minor leagues with the Keystones, he returned to the Cubs for 7 games in 1931 before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for fellow catcher Rollie Hemsley.  Pittsburgh Pirates  After batting .280 in 47 games for the Pirates after the trade, Grace was made the Pirate's regular catcher in 1932. He finished the season having committed only 1 error in 413 total chances, to establish a National League fielding record with a .998 fielding percentage, breaking the record set by Shanty Hogan just one year earlier. Over the next three seasons, Grace's playing time decreased in favor of Tom Padden, and after the 1935 season, he was traded along with pitcher Claude Passeau for another fellow catcher, Al Todd.  Philadelphia Phillies  Grace played two seasons for the Phillies, splitting time with Jimmy Wilson and Bill Atwood, Grace was traded a third time. Like each of the previous two trades, he was traded for another catcher, this time to the St. Louis Browns for Cap Clark. However, Grace never played for the Browns after the trade. Instead, he returned to minor league baseball, splitting the 1938 season between the Minneapolis Millers and the Columbus Red Birds. He continued to play in the minors until 1940. ==ReferencesSources== Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Lincoln Links players Category:Little Rock Travelers players Category:Muskogee Athletics players Category:Reading Keystones players Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:Columbus Red Birds players Category:Nashville Vols players Category:Baseball players from Kentucky Category:1907 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People from Ballard County, Kentucky ","title":"Earl Grace"},{"id":"19349067","text":"Michael Duncan Buerk (born 18 February 1946) is an English journalist and newsreader. He presented BBC News from 1973 to 2002 and has been the host of BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze since 1990. He was also the presenter of BBC One's docudrama 999 from 1992 to 2003. ==Early life== Buerk was born in Solihull, Warwickshire, and was educated at Solihull School, an Independent school in the West Midlands where he was a member of the Combined Cadet Force and represented the school on the sports field. Buerk's hopes of a career in the Royal Air Force were dashed when he failed an eyesight test at the selection centre. He briefly worked as a hod carrier. ==Reporter and newsreader== Buerk began his career in journalism with the Bromsgrove Messenger, South Wales Echo (he shared a house with Sue Lawley in Cardiff), and the Daily Mail. In 1970, he joined BBC Radio Bristol, where he was the first voice heard on air, before becoming a network reporter for BBC News in 1973. From 1983 to 1987, Buerk was the BBC's South Africa correspondent during the dying years of apartheid in South Africa. Buerk's uncompromising reports on the brutalities of the regime resulted in the South African government expelling him from the country after four years in the post. Buerk's reporting of the Ethiopian famine in October 1984 inspired the Band Aid charity record and, subsequently, the Live Aid concerts. His report is regarded as a watershed moment in crisis reporting that influenced modern coverage. He later anchored the BBC Nine O'Clock News and BBC News at Ten. He read the bulletin at 0100 GMT on 1 January 2000, the first BBC News bulletin of the 2000s.\\"The Road Taken, An Autobiography\\", Michael Buerk, Hutchinson, 2004 Buerk announced his retirement from BBC News in 2002, though he said he would continue to host other programmes. ==Other work== Michael Buerk with Bettany Hughes during the filming of Britain's Secret Treasures In 2010, Buerk narrated Sky1 reality show Pineapple Dance Studios. Buerk has also made five guest appearances on the BBC's The One Show in April and September 2010. He has also appeared as a fill-in presenter for Jason Manford on six occasions. Since July 2012, Buerk has co-presented ITV's Britain's Secret Treasures with Bettany Hughes, looking at fifty of the most remarkable archaeological finds made by the British public. On 6 October 2013, he began hosting Inside the National Trust, a new documentary series. Buerk has hosted BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze since 1990 and The Choice since 1998. On 22 October 2014, the BBC apologised for the language used in Buerk's early morning trail for that evening's Moral Maze in which he began: \\"Nobody comes out of the Ched Evans rape case with any credit ‚Äì not the victim who'd drunk so much she could barely stand, nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances.\\"Anita Singh \\"Ched Evans' victim was drunk and deserves no credit, says BBC's Michael Buerk\\", Telegraph, 22 October 2014 Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis England and Wales, accused him of practising \\"victim-blaming.\\" She commented: \\"To infer that being drunk is in any way 'morally' comparable to committing the serious and violent crime of rape is deeply offensive.\\"Ryan Hooper \\"BBC apologises after presenter Michael Buerk criticised Ched Evans rape victim for 'being drunk'\\", Independent (Eire), 22 October 2014\\"BBC apologises over Michael Buerk‚Äôs comments on Ched Evans case\\", theguardian.com (Press Association), 22 October 2014 In 2013, Buerk voiced a Marmite advert in which spoof rescue teams rescue lost forgotten jars at the back of cupboards and fridges and despite receiving a number of complaints the advert still continues. Beginning on 16 November 2014, Buerk took part in the fourteenth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! On 3 December 2014, he was the third celebrity to be eliminated in the public vote. ==Charity work== On 28 July 2007, Buerk appeared on a celebrity version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? with Jennie Bond to raise money for NCH, the children's charity. Between them they won ¬£64,000. He is a supporter of the British Red Cross and in October 2008 came out in support of an alternative reality game, Traces of Hope, which the charity developed. On the BBC's Children in Need, Buerk has performed several times along with an ensemble of BBC News presenters. In 2004, he dressed in leather to perform Duran Duran classics and in 2005, he sang Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". ==Opinions== In August 2005, Buerk asserted in a Radio Times interview that the \\"shift in the balance of power between the sexes\\" has gone too far, we need to \\"admit the problem\\", and that men are now little more than \\"sperm donors\\".Richard Alleyne \\"It's a woman's world, moans Michael Buerk\\", Daily Telegraph, 16 August 2005 In particular, Buerk objected to the many women now in senior positions within the BBC. Former newsreader Anna Ford commented: \\"He's a dear old-fashioned chauvinist of the first order.\\"Tom Leonard \\"Buerk 'is bonkers if he thinks women are taking over the world'\\", Telegraph, 17 August 2005Chris Johnston \\"Montague clashes with Buerk over gender comments\\", theguardian.com (Media Guardian), 18 August 2005 An article was published in anticipation of Buerk's 45-minute TV-essay, \\"Michael Buerk on What Are Men For?\\", which was part of a series on Channel Five, Don't Get Me Started! broadcast on Tuesday 23 August 2005. Guardian television reviewer Sam Wollaston thought Buerk had \\"been thoroughly, and quite rightly, crucified\\" in the pre-publicity. At the Hay-on-Wye literary festival earlier in the year, Buerk criticised contemporary newsreaders for being overpaid autocue-reading \\"lame brains\\".Brian Courtis \\"In whom we trust\\", The Age, 3 July 2005 At the end of 2012, Buerk despaired of the state of Britain and of the BBC. Of the Corporation's coverage of the Thames River Pageant celebrating Britain and the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the throne, he wrote: \\"The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country's bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park.\\"Caroline Davies \\"Michael Buerk savages BBC's coverage of Queen's diamond jubilee\\", guardian.co.uk, 30 October 2012 In an article for Radio Times in April 2014 about 'grey power' in television, Buerk referred to presenters who had gone to employment tribunals over claims of age discrimination.Michael Buerk \\"Why grey power is now a force to be reckoned with on television\\", Radio Times, 12 April 2014 Several older female presenters have won cases over wrongful dismissal. Buerk wrote: \\"If you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can't see why you should keep it when you don't.\\" Quoting a comment by Anne Robinson (\\"The viewers don't want to watch ugly\\") he speculated: \\"She seemed to say it through gritted teeth, or at least a flawless but strangely taut face ‚Äì a sign perhaps that she had taken her own advice to stop complaining and work on staying attractive.\\" He did though quote Angela Rippon who spoke positively about older people (including herself) being able to continue their careers in television.Hannah Furness \\"Michael Buerk criticises TV presenters who 'cry ageism'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 8 April 2014Hatty Collier \\"Michael Buerk criticises female presenters who 'cry ageism'\\", The Guardian, 8 April 2014 Responding to Buerk in The Guardian, presenter Miriam O'Reilly, who won her case for unfair dismissal on age grounds in 2011, asserted: \\"The rules that apply to women in TV don't apply to men. Men can age, women can't. Women have to be attractive, men don't.\\"Miriam O'Reilly \\"Michael Buerk's comments show sexism still exists in the TV industry\\", The Guardian, 8 April 2014 In 2016, Buerk was critical of Emma Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch, and other celebrity liberals. He said in an interview with Ross Kemp ‚ÄúI hate it when feather-bedded thesps pay flying visits to the desperate to parade their bleeding hearts and trumpet their infantile ideas on what 'must be done'.

It faces Mont Blanc, and is within the territory of the commune of Passy, in the Haute-Savoie department. Constructed at the urging of canon Jean Dev√©my and designed by the Savoyard architect Maurice Novarina, the church is celebrated for its decoration, contributed by some of the best-known artists of the twentieth century. It is also viewed as an important landmark in the development of modern sacred art; its consecration in 1950 caused much consternation within the ranks of the clergy of France, who had hitherto been accustomed to more traditionally classical structures. On June 11, 2004, Notre-Dame de Toute Gr√¢ce du Plateau d'Assy was classed as a monument historique de France. Eglise Notre-Dame-de- Toute-Gr√¢ce ==History== Before World War II, the plateau d'Assy was known as a spa area, and was especially popular with sufferers of tuberculosis. At one point close to twenty sanatoriums could be found in the area. Some of these were equipped with small chapels, while others were visited by chaplains who catered to the sick. There was, however, no church for the area. In 1935, Jean Dev√©my, then serving as chaplain to the sanatorium of Sancellemoz, hit upon the idea of building a church dedicated to serving not only the sick of the spas, but also the personnel who worked at them. With the blessing of the bishop of Annecy, Florent du Bois de la Villerabel, he decided to hold an architectural contest to design the new structure. The contest took place in 1937, and was won by the young architect Maurice Novarina. Novarina's plan was to use materials native to the region in the construction of the church; this would include various types of stone - including slate - and wood. The work would be given to local concerns. Construction began in 1938 and was for the most part concluded at the start of World War II. Even as the church was being erected, Dev√©my was considering ways of decorating the new building. While he was considering his options, his friend, the artist and Dominican Marie-Alain Couturier, invited him to Paris to visit an art exhibition. Dev√©my was greatly taken with a stained glass window of Georges Rouault which depicted the Passion of Christ. Supposedly, when he measured the windows of the church upon his return, the Rouault window was found to be an exact fit for the structure. Dev√©my referred to this incident as the \\"miracle of Assy\\". Notre-Dame de Toute Gr√¢ce du Plateau d'Assy was formally blessed in 1941; in that same year the crypt was opened for services. ==Design==  Architecture  In collaboration with √âdouard Malot, Novarina designed a church to be built out of local stone, called Taveyannaz sandstone; it is the same type of stone frequently used to build chalets in the Savoie. The roof is pointed, and is meant to sustain large amounts of snow; the foundation of the structure is solidly anchored in the soil. The church is topped by a massive twenty-eight- metre bell tower, carefully designed to withstand local tectonic movements. Eight massive pillars support a hood to a depth of five metres. The interior of the building is meant to resemble a Roman chapel, with a rectangular nave flanked by two aisles. The choir is semicircular, surrounded by an ambulatory and sitting above the crypt. Arcades mounted on monolithic pillars separate different portions of the structure.  Decorative scheme  The church is best known for its rich interior decoration, which Dev√©my commissioned from some of the most famous artists of the first half of the twentieth century; consequently, its interior scheme has been said to serve as a microcosm of early modernism and of the era's changing conception of sacred art. Dev√©my was able to contact many of the artists through Father Couturier, and most who were asked accepted with enthusiasm. Among those who contributed paintings, sculptures, tapestries, stained glass, ceramics, and mosaics to the church were Pierre Bonnard, Fernand L√©ger, Jean Lur√ßat, his student Paul Cosandier, Germaine Richier, Georges Rouault, Jean Bazaine, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Jacques Lipchitz, Marc Chagall, Constant Demaison, Ladislas Kijno, Claude Mary, Carlo Sergio Signori, and Th√©odore Strawinsky. The artists were chosen for their skill and not for their religious bent; this was a hallmark of Couturier's manner of thinking about religious art. == References == Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1946 Category:Churches in Haute- Savoie Category:Monuments historiques of Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes ","title":"√âglise Notre-Dame de Toute Gr√¢ce du Plateau d'Assy"},{"id":"19349085","text":"Kevin St. Onge was the Guinness World Record holder for throwing a single playing card, from 1979-1992.

In 1833 he became the head of the Gebr√ºder Bethmann bank. Von Bethmann focused especially on railway construction. Together with the House of Rothschild, he established three railroad companies in succession: Taunus-Eisenbahn AG in 1836, Frankfurt-Hanauer Eisenbahn in 1844, and the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Nordbahn. In the 1850s he also invested in (among others) the Italian central railroad company, the Austrian state-controlled railroad company, and the Rhein-Nahe- Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft. From 1854 until the loss of Frankfurt's status as a Free City in 1866, von Bethmann was the Prussian consul general in Frankfurt. In 1854 he was elevated to the status of a Freiherr in the Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1863 he hosted the assembly of German princes in his garden house. Like his father before him, he generously contributed to philanthropic causes and to the arts in Frankfurt. Von Bethmann, who had to cope with a lifelong handicap due to a hip impediment, was married to Maria n√©e Freiin von Bose (1819‚Äì1882), with whom he had two sons and three daughters, among them Ludwig Simon Moritz Freiherr von Bethmann, who was named after his grandfather Simon Moritz and who would later take the reins as the head of the House of Bethmann. ==Notes See also == *Bethmann family ==Bibliography== * Wolfgang Kl√∂tzer (ed.): Frankfurter Biographie.

Licensed to Linesville, Pennsylvania, United States, the station serves the Meadville, Pennsylvania area. The station is currently owned by Vilkie Communications and features programing from ABC Radio, Jones Radio Network and Premiere Radio Networks. Before being purchased by Vilkie Communications, WMVL was based in Linesville, and was known as WVCC (\\"The Wonderful Voice of Crawford County\\"). ==History== The station first signed on the air May 4, 1970, as WVCC, with the call letters standing for \\"The Wonderful Voice of Crawford County\\". Arthur W. Cervi served as the station's president and general manager, as well as the licensee. The station played a format of easy listening music, with specialty programming of country and classical music on the weekends. Cervi, a resident of Pittsburgh's East Hills, moved his family to northwestern Pennsylvania shortly after being granted the license. For the duration that he owned the station, Cervi ran the radio station from studios he constructed in the basement of his home on Maple Road in Linesville, and did much of the programming, engineering, and sales work himself. This frugal business model allowed WVCC to serve primarily Linesville and the western portion of Crawford County, though it was a fairly rural community that did not have a great retail base for commercial advertising business. Nonetheless, WVCC became a very powerful local voice for the Linesville area, through its involvement in the community. By 1980, the station had moved from an easy listening to a more adult contemporary sound, with Cervi's son, Arthur W. Cervi, Jr. assuming management and programming duties. Towards the end of the 80's, WVCC switched from music reels played by an automation system to a satellite-delivered format of Adult Standards from the Satellite Music Network. The station's present owner, Joseph Vilkie, joined the radio station in the late 1990s. After the turn of the 21st Century, Cervi wanted to retire and offered Vilkie the opportunity to purchase the station. Vilkie and his father, Eugene Vilkie, formed Vilkie Communications and purchased the station on April 1, 2003. Not long after taking over the station, Vilkie Communications moved the station from Cervi's basement to its present location at the Vernon Village shopping center in Meadville, switched the call letters to WMVL and changed the station's format from adult standards to oldies. The station also embraced the resort community of Conneaut Lake in its marketing efforts in addition to Linesville and western Crawford County. ==Radio Hosts== Cool 101.7 advertises itself as \\"local radio, local people,\\" and as such the station features on-air personalities predominately from the Meadville and Crawford County area. The station's morning show is the only one the Crawford county listening area that begins at 5am and was hosted on weekdays for many years by Dave Hanahan, until shortly before his death on Saturday, January 23, 2016, after a two-year battle with cancer. \\"Susie Q\\" hosts late mornings into the early afternoon. Dr. Tom Arno hosts the late afternoon block from his home studio in Charleston South Carolina. Tom Arno remains one Meadville's most popular radio personalities despite broadcasting from another state. He also acts as the in-house meteorologist for Cool 101.7. The weekday late night block is hosted by Jenna Wagner, weekend afternoons are hosted by Tonya Vorisek and Sunday afternoons are hosted by Chuck Burkett. ==Sports Coverage== WMVL is the sole broadcaster of many high school sports teams in the Crawford County area. Local football, baseball, basketball and wrestling are covered extensively throughout the year. In 2011 WMVL also joined in a partnership to broadcast college sports for Allegheny College, including football and basketball. Operations manager and sports director Chuck Stopp has been heard on the station since 1970, and continued with the station since it changed from WVCC to WMVL. He provides play-by-play commentary for a majority of the high school and college sports that are broadcast on the station. In addition, WMVL serves as an affiliate for the Motor Racing Network's NASCAR coverage. ==References * MVL Category:Classic hits radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 2011 ","title":"WMVL"},{"id":"19349126","text":"Nouyarn Island is an uninhabited Baffin Island offshore island located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the territory of Nunavut.

Apollonian gasket If a circle is iteratively inscribed into the interstitial curved triangles between three mutually tangent circles, an Apollonian gasket results, one of the earliest fractals described in print. Three mutually tangent circles of radii in ratios 4:4:1 yield a 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple triangle ==Malfatti's problem== Malfatti's problem is to carve three cylinders from a triangular block of marble, using as much of the marble as possible. In 1803, Gian Francesco Malfatti conjectured that the solution would be obtained by inscribing three mutually tangent circles into the triangle (a problem that had previously been considered by Japanese mathematician Ajima Naonobu); these circles are now known as the Malfatti circles, although the conjecture has been proven to be false. ==Six circles theorem== A chain of six circles can be drawn such that each circle is tangent to two sides of a given triangle and also to the preceding circle in the chain. The chain closes; the sixth circle is always tangent to the first circle. ==Generalizations== Problems involving tangent circles are often generalized to spheres. For example, the Fermat problem of finding sphere(s) tangent to four given spheres is a generalization of Apollonius' problem, whereas Soddy's hexlet is a generalization of a Steiner chain. == See also == * Tangent lines to circles * Circle packing theorem, the result that every planar graph may be realized by a system of tangent circles * Hexafoil, the shape formed by a ring of six tangent circles * Feuerbach's theorem on the tangency of the nine-point circle of a triangle with its incircle and excircles * Descartes' theorem * Ford circle * Bankoff circle * Archimedes' twin circles * Archimedean circle * Schoch circles * Woo circles * Arbelos * Ring lemma ==References * Category:Circles ","title":"Tangent circles"},{"id":"19349158","text":"KEDP (91.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Variety format.

The publication refers to the traditions of a Polish language paper Gazeta Lwowska, which was published between 1811 and 1944 and as such was one of the oldest Polish newspapers. Originally, Gazeta Lwowska was a press organ of the Austrian authorities of Galicia and it limited itself to publishing legal announcements. In 1873, when W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åozi≈Ñski became editor-in-chief, it began inserting local and world news, and since 1874, it published a monthly addition Przewodnik Naukowy i Literacki (Scientific and Literary Guide), dedicated to history, literature, geography, economics and ethnography. Among writers who cooperated with Gazeta Lwowska, there were Adam Krechowiecki, Ludwik Kubala, Karol Szajnocha, J√≥zef Szujski, Alfred Wysocki. After 1918, when Lemberg was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, Gazeta Lwowska was a local daily, popular in the Lw√≥w Voivodeship. Following the joint Nazi and Soviet annexation of Poland, the newspaper stopped publication. It re-established publication briefly from July 1941 to July 1944 during the period of German occupation as vehicle for Nazi propaganda. During German occupation, Gazeta Lwowska was very popular among readers, with the circulation reaching 90,000 in August 1943.Gazeta Lwowska in the years 1941-1944 by Grzegorz Hryciuk Known as Lembergierka, the Gazeta was liked by Polish readers, as it was not as rabidly anti-Polish like the previous, defunct, Soviet-sponsored Czerwony Sztandar (1939‚Äì1941). Its editors-in-chief were only Germans, such as Felix Rufenach and A.G. Lehmann. Among Polish employees, a significant number was informally connected with the resistance movement. Gazeta's street vendors organized a patriotic demonstration in Lw√≥w, on 11 November 1943 (Polish independence day). On that day, several copies of the newspaper were stamped with a Polish Eagle, and with an inscription \\"Poland will triumph\\". Gazeta Lwowska returned on 24 December 1990 as a biweekly, published by the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land (Towarzystwo Kultury Polskiej Ziemi Lwowskiej - TKPZL). == References == Category:Polish-language newspapers Category:Publications established in 1811 Category:Newspapers published in Ukraine Category:Newspapers published in the Soviet Union Category:Mass media in Lviv Category:1990 establishments in Ukraine Category:Polish diaspora in Ukraine ","title":"Gazeta Lwowska"},{"id":"19349190","text":"Maurice Novarina (June 28, 1907 - September 28, 2002) was a Savoyard architect; born in Thonon-les-Bains, in Haute-Savoie, he died in the town of his birth.

It is designed to meet the LMP1 and LMP2 regulations for Le Mans Prototypes in the Le Mans Series as well as at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and replace Pescarolo's previous C60 chassis which had been heavily modified from cars purchased through Courage Comp√©tition. The first 01s debuted at the 2007 1000 km of Monza, and are still used by several teams today. == Development == At the end of 2006, new regulations came into effect for the various series supported by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). These regulations required extensive changes to the layout of a chassis, leaving many teams to purchase or build new cars as their current cars would be ineligible in 2007. Pescarolo Sport at the time was campaigning two Pescarolo C60s, cars which Pescarolo Sport had extensively modified from their origins as Courage C60s a few years prior. The C60s however did not meet the 2007 regulations, and team owner Henri Pescarolo chose to become a full constructor for the first time. Many features from the C60 were carried over in the design of the 01. Unlike the C60, the 01 was intended to be not only used by the Pescarolo Sport team, but also to be sold to customers. In order to broaden their customer base, the 01 was designed to meet the regulations of both the LMP1 and LMP2 classes with minor variation required. == Racing history ==  2007  As the first 01s were being completed, several teams announced their intent to purchase the chassis. British team Rollcentre Racing chose to re-enter the LMP1 category and campaign an 01-Judd alongside the two Pescarolo Sport cars. The German Kruse Motorsports team were the first to purchase an LMP2-spec car, using the smaller Judd V8 as a powerplant. Lister Cars also announced their intentions to purchase a chassis, which they would later modify, to replace their ineligible Storm LMP. At the Pescarolo 01's debut in the Le Mans Series opener, the #16 car of Pescarolo Sport managed to finish in second place, between the two factory Peugeot diesels, while the #17 car finished fourth. The Rollcentre and Kruse cars also finished the event in points-earning positions. At the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo Sport was returning as the previous year's runner-up. All four 01s from the Le Mans Series were entered, and three of them were able to successfully reach the finish. The #16 Pescarolo of Emmanuel Collard, Jean-Christophe Boullion, and Romain Dumas was classified third, eleven laps behind the winning Audi, while Rollcentre Racing's car was a further eleven laps behind in fourth place. Pescarolo's #17 car finished well back in 13th, while Kruse's car suffered mechanical problems and retired in the first half of the event. At the following race, the N√ºrburgring 1000 km, the works car managed a third place again, behind the two Peugeot 908 HDi FAP and for the Spa event (1000 km) on August 19 it was classified second in the race, just being beaten by the surviving Peugeot of Lamy-Sarrazin (the other one having not finished the race due to a rare mechanical failure), the other works Pescarolo ranking at 4th place. For the British race (1000 km of Silverstone, 16 September) the Nr 16 car driven by Collard and Boullion again, ranked 2nd, still behind a Peugeot while the privateer Rollcentre car was third. For the last race of the Le Mans Series (Mil Milhas do Brasil on November 10) on the Interlagos circuit, just one Pescarolo 01 was entered (the works car of Boullion-Collard-Primat) and it finished the race in 4th place behind the two Peugeot and the works Creation CA07. Pescarolo's #16 good results allow Pescarolo Sport to secure second place in the LMP1 Teams Championship. Pescarolo's #17 car struggled to earn points and finished seventh in points, but the Rollcentre team were able to outperform the one factory Pescarolo and finish fourth in the championship. Kruse's season was cut short as a fire on board the team's transporter destroyed their car.  2008  For the 2008 season, five Pescarolo 01s would once again be entered in the Le Mans Series. Pescarolo Sport and Rollcentre Racing remained as they had the year before (Pescarolo with 01 and new 07 chassis), but two more 01s were entered by the French Saulnier Racing. The team, now owned by Jacques Nicolet, entered an 01 each in the LMP1 (which was the ex-works 05 chassis) and LMP2 (the brand new 06 chassis) classes. In the LMP1 category, the four teams faced stiffer competition from not only the returning Peugeots, but also newcomers Audi. Pescarolo Sport finished on the podium twice in five races, once each for the #16 and #17 cars. It was the #16 car which once again led amongst Pescarolos in the Teams Championship, finishing in sixth place, while every other Pescarolo team managed to earn at least a point during the year. In LMP2, the Saulnier car using the latest V8 from Judd had a best finish of second in class at the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring and successfully finished the year fourth in the Teams Championship, the best non-Porsche in the field. As in the previous year, the entire contingent of 01s competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and once again nearly all were able to finish. #17 led the 01 field home in seventh place, the best finisher using petrol fuel. Rollcentre's race ended in eleventh place, while the LMP1 Saulnier entry survived for 26th. In LMP2, the Saulnier 01 was third in its class, 21 laps behind the winning Porsche, and ranked eighteenth in the overall standings. Only the #16 Pescarolo, which had earned a podium the previous year, was unable to complete the full race.  2009  In 2009, Pescarolo Sport and OAK Racing (the new name of Saulnier Racing), partnered with Mazda France, competed in the Le Mans Series season, each with two Evo chassis'. Pescarolo Sport #16 finished second in the LMP1 class Teams Championship thirteen points behind AMR Eastern Europe who ran a Lola-Aston Martin B09/60. They ran a #17 car for the first two-round before replacing it with the Peugeot. OAK Racing managed sixth and eighth in the LMP2 Teams Championship with eighth place car #35 earning a ten-point deduction. The car could have been placed in fourth position if the points deduction was not in place. Pescarolo Sport competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with only one car being #16. Their #17 car was a Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. OAK Racing also campaigned their two LMP2-spec 01's at Le Mans. Pescarolo Sport managed to finish eighth overall and in class among tough opposition which included nine diesel-powered LMP1 cars as well as petrol opposition from Aston Martin Racing and Oreca. OAK Racing car #24 did well in LMP2 finishing third in class and 20th overall. Car #35 retired after 208 laps. In December 2009 OAK Racing reached an agreement with Pescarolo Sport to take over the manufacturing side of its business. Consequently, the development and construction of the chassis, bodywork and spare parts of the Pescarolo prototypes was assumed by OAK Racing, as well as all commercial activities.  2010  In 2010, Pescarolo Sport did not race at all, the company being eventually disbanded on July 13 after having been in receivership in June. Though, OAK Racing, still partnered with Mazda France, competed in the Le Mans Series season, with two Evo chassis' in LMP2 category. On 15 October 2010, during the asset sale of Pescarolo Sport, OAK Racing owner Jacques Nicolet and Prestige Racing‚Äôs Jo√´l Rivi√®re joined forces to purchase the lots, later presenting them to Henri Pescarolo and thus allowing him to revive his team.  2011  2011 saw the return of a Pescarolo works team under the form of a new team named Pescarolo Team, succeeding to Pescarolo Sport, being bankrupt in July 2010 after their financial difficulties. Pescarolo Team raced in the LMP1 class in the 2011 Le Mans Series season at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. OAK Racing raced their own modified version of the 01 with two LMP1 cars and two LMP2 cars. The No. 35 OAK Pescarolo 01 finished third in the LMP2 class at the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, the other two cars OAK Racing brought along (which were LMP1 cars) both retired, one of which led the race overall for a brief period after a full course caution. Pescarolo Team competed at the 6 Hours of Castellet with one car. Pescarolo's return was a dream comeback as they won overall. The grandfathered V10-powered car finished one lap ahead of second place car with Emmanuel Collard, Christophe Tinseau and Julien Jousse piloting the car.  2012  OAK Racing split the design, manufacturing, and sales divisions of the team into an independent company named Onroak Automotive and continued to run their modified version of the 01 in the LMP1 class for the upcoming 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season. Their LMP2 car was renamed the Morgan LMP2 due to OAK's partnership with Morgan Motor Company. Pescarolo Team used the 01 for the last time at the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring (with a 5-liter engine, finishing 6th overall and 3rd among WEC LMP1 teams, behind the two Joest Racing Audi R18 TDIs) before being replaced by the Pescarolo 03, a modified version of Aston Martin Racing's AMR One. OAK Racing managed to finish in 2nd in the LMP2-class of Sebring, but experienced a turbulent season and finished 4th in the LMP2 Trophy.  2013  24 Hours of Le Mans winner. The OAK- Pescarolo 01 was retired at the beginning of 2013. OAK Racing decided to concentrate on running the Morgan LMP2. The Morgan LMP2, equipped with a Nissan VK45DE engine, enjoyed great success in 2013, winning the LMP2-class of the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans and both the Asian Le Mans Series and World Endurance Championship in the LMP2 category.  2014  For the 2014 season the Morgan LMP2 was campaigned for the World Endurance Championship under the title of G-Drive Racing. It was driven to first in class finishes at the 6 hours at Silverstone and 6 hours at Spa. It qualified for the 24 hours at Le Mans 13th overall, 4th in class, but did not finish. It was replaced with the newer Ligier JS P2 for the remainder of the season.  2015  In the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans the Morgan Nissan and Morgan Evo SARD entered the race in the LMP2 class. The Morgan finished 19th overall and the Morgan Evo retired with engine problems. == References External links == * * Pescarolo 01-Judd Specifications Category:Le Mans Prototypes Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars Category:Sports prototypes ","title":"Pescarolo 01"},{"id":"19349240","text":"Guarded logic is a choice set of dynamic logic involved in choices, where outcomes are limited. A simple example of guarded logic is as follows: if X is true, then Y, else Z can be expressed in dynamic logic as (X?;Y)‚à™(~X?;Z). This shows a guarded logical choice: if X holds, then X?;Y is equal to Y, and ~X?;Z is blocked, and Y‚à™block is also equal to Y. Hence, when X is true, the primary performer of the action can only take the Y branch, and when false the Z branch. A real-world example is the idea of paradox: something cannot be both true and false. A guarded logical choice is one where any change in true affects all decisions made down the line. ==History== Before the use of guarded logic there were two major terms used to interpret modal logic. Mathematical logic and database theory (Artificial Intelligence) were first- order predicate logic. Both terms found sub-classes of first-class logic and efficiently used in solvable languages which can be used for research. But neither could explain powerful fixed-point extensions to modal style logics. Later Moshe Y. Vardi made a conjecture that a tree model would work for many modal style logics. The guarded fragment of first-order logic was first introduced by Hajnal Andr√©ka, Istv√°n N√©meti and Johan van Benthem in their article Modal languages and bounded fragments of predicate logic. They successfully transferred key properties of description, modal, and temporal logic to predicate logic. It was found that the robust decidability of guarded logic could be generalized with a tree model property. The tree model can also be a strong indication that guarded logic extends modal framework which retains the basics of modal logics. Modal logics are generally characterized by invariances under bisimulation. It also so happens that invariance under bisimulation is the root of tree model property which helps towards defining automata theory. ==Types of guarded logic== Within Guarded Logic there exists numerous guarded objects. The first being guarded fragment which are first- order logic of modal logic. Guarded fragments generalize modal quantification through finding relative patterns of quantification. The syntax used to denote guarded fragment is GF. Another object is guarded fixed point logic denoted ŒºGF naturally extends guarded fragment from fixed points of least to greatest. Guarded bisimulations are objects which when analyzing guarded logic. All relations in a slightly modified standard relational algebra with guarded bisimulation and first-order definable are known as guarded relational algebra. This is denoted using GRA. Along with first-order guarded logic objects, there are objects of second-order guarded logic. It is known as Guarded Second-Order Logic and denoted GSO. Similar to second-order logic, guarded second-order logic quantifies whose range over guarded relations restrict it semantically. This is different from second-order logic which the range is restricted over arbitrary relations. ==Definitions of guarded logic== Let B be a relational structure with universe B and vocabulary œÑ. i) A set X ‚äÜ B is guarded in B if there exists a ground atom Œ±(b_1, ..., b_k) in B such that X = {b_1, ..., b_k}. ii) A œÑ-structure A, in particular a substructure A ‚äÜ B, is guarded if its universe is a guarded set in A (in B). iii) A tuple (b_1, ..., b_n) ‚àà B^n is guarded in B if {b_1, ..., b_n} ‚äÜ X for some guarded set X ‚äÜ B. iv) A tuple (b_1, ..., b_k) ‚àà B^k is a guarded list in B if its components are pairwise distinct and {b_1, ..., b_k} is a guarded set. The empty list is taken to be a guarded list. v) A relation X ‚äÜ B^n is guarded if it only consists of guarded tuples. Guarded bisimulation A guarded bisimulation between two œÑ-structures A and B is a non-empty set I of finite partial isomorphic f: X ‚Üí Y from A to B such that the back and forth conditions are satisfied. Back: For every f: X ‚Üí Y in I and for every guarded set Y\` ‚äÜ B, there exists a partial isomorphic g: X\` ‚Üí Y\` in I such that f^-1 and g^-1 agree on Y ‚à© Y\`. Forth For every f: X ‚Üí Y in I and for every guarded set X\` ‚äÜ A, there exists a partial isomorphic g: X\` ‚Üí Y\` in I such that f and g agree on X ‚à© X\`. ==References== Category:Modal logic ","title":"Guarded logic"},{"id":"19349244","text":"McLean Island is an uninhabited Baffin Island offshore island located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the territory of Nunavut.

From 1955 to 1982, the Hornets struggled to find success on the football field, as the team's overall winning percentage during that era slipped to (74‚Äì182‚Äì8). From 1983 through the 2013 season, ESU's winning percentage increased to (182‚Äì157‚Äì0), and all five coaches at ESU during this era have either a winning record or a tied record. During the 2012 season, the Hornets competed in a postseason game for the first time since 2003 and placed second in the conference. Until the 1930s, the Kansas State Normal/Kansas State Teachers College (now Emporia State University) didn't have an athletics nickname. In the early 1930s, the athletic teams were then known as the \\"Yaps\\". However, many people disliked the name, most notably legendary coach, Vic Trusler. Trusler suggested to a local writer, Cecil Carle of the Emporia Gazette, that the university's athletic teams should be called the \\"Yellow Jackets\\" but instead, the name was changed to \\"Hornets\\" due to the lack of newspaper space. Early history (1893‚Äì1927) Homer Woodson Hargiss is the only football coach in ESU history to produce a perfect season, which happened in 1923 and 1926. The Kansas State Normal School (KSN), now known as Emporia State University, fielded its first football team in 1893, which had no coach. In 1893, KSN played the College of Emporia, which KSN won 14‚Äì0 and lost 0‚Äì24 against the Ottawa Braves. After playing six abbreviated game seasons, KSN played its first full schedule in 1899 and had a 2‚Äì3‚Äì0 record under no head coach. The 1899 football season was the first of the \\"Turnpike Tussle\\" series, which is played between the Hornets and the Washburn Ichabods. In 1900, John Lamb served one season as KSN's football coach, posting the first winning season in school history (5‚Äì3‚Äì1). After Lamb's season, Northern Iowa's coach Fred Williams, who later was an attorney, came to KSN from to serve as head coach, but struggled to a 2‚Äì6‚Äì1 record in his only season in 1901. The 1902 season featured the program's second‚Äìonly game of its rivalry against Washburn, a 0‚Äì6 Hornet loss. The program had eight head coaches from 1900‚Äì13, but in 1914, Bill Hargiss took the position in 1914. He held it for the next three highly successful seasons, through 1917, and then again from 1920‚Äì27. Hargiss' overall coaching record at KSN/KSTC was 61‚Äì23‚Äì11. Hargiss is the only head coach in school history to have an undefeated season and puts him third at the school in terms of winning percentage (). Hargiss' best seasons were the 1921 and 1926 seasons, when the Normals/Teachers posted an undefeated season and outscored their opponents 144 to 3. The closest game of the season was a 6‚Äì0 battle against Hargiss's former team, the College of Emporia. ESU has not had another undefeated season since 1926. In the 1918 and 1919 seasons, KSN had two unsuccessful coaches, H. D. McChesney with a 2‚Äì2‚Äì0 () record, and George McLaren with a 1‚Äì6‚Äì2 record. Fran Welch era (1928‚Äì1942, 1946‚Äì1954) Fran Welch, who coached the football team from 1928‚Äì1954 KSN alum Fran Welch was hired by his alma mater as the 13th head football coach in 1928, taking over after Bill Hargiss left for the University of Kansas. Welch led the Teachers to a 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 record during his first season. In the 1932 and 33 seasons were a low season for the Yaps, as they went to 5‚Äì11‚Äì2. From 1934 until 1942, the Hornets had some winning seasons, and losing seasons. Because of WWII, the Hornets did not field a team from 1942‚Äì45. In the return season of 1946, the Hornets went 4‚Äì5; however, in 1947, the Hornets turned things around, leading the 1948 team to a 34‚Äì20 win over Southwest Missouri State University at the Missouri-Kansas Bowl. In the next five out of six seasons, the Hornets won five conference championships. Not only did Welch finish his career as the most successful coach in ESU History, but he finished with 7 conference championships and one bowl game, leading to an overall record of 115‚Äì82‚Äì15 () during his 26 years as head coach. The declining era (1955‚Äì1982) Caywood era (1955‚Äì1966) In 1955, KSTC hired Keith Caywood as the 14th head football coach of KSTC. In his 12 years as head coach at KSTC, he only had one winning season; in 1958, the Hornets went 5‚Äì4‚Äì1, which included a 0‚Äì21 loss to Lincoln (MO) at the Mineral Water Bowl. In 1966, Caywood resigned as head coach posting an overall record of 25‚Äì79‚Äì5 (). Blaylock, Lance, and Elliott eras (1967‚Äì1974) From 1967 until 1970, the Hornets continued to struggle. In 1967, Ron Blaylock became the 15th head coach for the Hornets, going 1‚Äì9‚Äì0 in his first season. Blaylock resigned after two seasons in 1968, ending with an overall record of 6‚Äì11‚Äì2 (). In 1969, Jim Lance was hired as the 16th head coach and much like Blaylock, was unsuccessful. In 1970, he resigned with a record of 6‚Äì12‚Äì0 (). After nearly two decades of being unsuccessful, KSTC hired Harold Elliott as the 17th head coach in hopes that he could rebuild the program. In 1971, his first season, he led the Hornets to a 3‚Äì6‚Äì1 record, but turned things around in the 1973 season, he went on to a 7‚Äì4‚Äì0 record, winning the conference championship and a 14‚Äì17 loss to William Penn at the Boot Hill Bowl. He repeated the conference championship in 1974 with a 7‚Äì2‚Äì0 record. Elliott left KSTC to become the head coach at the University of Texas at Arlington, leaving KSTC with a 17‚Äì11‚Äì1 () record. Hoover and Seaman eras (1975‚Äì1982) For the next nine seasons, Emporia State continued to decline. Dave Hoover became the 18th head coach at ESU, with an overall record of 9‚Äì40‚Äì0 (). After Hoover was let go, Bob Seaman became the 19th head football coach for Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas and he held that position for four seasons, from 1979 until 1982. His overall coaching record at Emporia State was 10‚Äì30. - style=\\";\\" colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"'''''' - style=\\";\\"  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  '''''' Larry Kramer era (1983‚Äì1994) After nearly three decades of being unsuccessful, Larry Kramer became the 20th head coach of Emporia State. In his first two season at ESU, he posted a record of 5‚Äì15, but in 1985, he turned the team around and posted a record of 6‚Äì4. In 1987 and 1988, Kramer led the Hornets to the NAIA post-season playoffs, which included two losses. In 1989, Kramer led the team to a conference championship and two NAIA playoff games, which led to the NAIA Division I National Championship game, in which they lost 20‚Äì34 to Carson-Newman University of Jefferson City, Tennessee. From 1990 until his resignation in 1994, the Hornets posted a record of 26‚Äì24‚Äì0. Kramer resigned after the 1994 season to become an assistant coach for the Kansas State Wildcats, leaving ESU with an overall record of 71‚Äì54‚Äì0 (). - style=\\"\\" colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Independent - - style=\\"\\" colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"'''''' Manny Matsakis era (1995‚Äì1998) The 21st head football coach for the Hornets was Manny Matsakis. During Matsakis' four years, the Hornets went 27‚Äì17‚Äì0 (). After the 1998 season, Matsakis left Emporia State to be an assistant for the University of Wyoming. Jerry Kill era (1999‚Äì2000) Jerry Kill became the 22nd head football coach for Emporia State in 1999. In his first season, the Hornets went 5‚Äì6‚Äì0, but in his last season in 2000, the Hornets went 6‚Äì5‚Äì0. After the 2000 season, he left with a tied record of 11‚Äì11‚Äì0 () to be the head coach at the Southern Illinois Salukis. Kill was most recently the head coach for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Dave Wiemers era (2001‚Äì2006) Dave Wiemers took the helm as the 23rd Hornet football coach in 2001, replacing Jerry Kill. Although the Hornets were unsuccessful in his first season going 5‚Äì6, Wiemers led the Hornets to a 9‚Äì2 season in 2002 and a trip to the Mineral Water Bowl, which they won in overtime 34‚Äì27 against Winona State. In 2003, the Hornets won a co-conference championship and made their first‚Äìever trip to the NCAA Division II playoffs, losing to Winona State 3‚Äì10. Following those two successful seasons, the Hornets declined and failed to have a winning season. Between 2004 and 2006, the Hornets posted a combined record of 12‚Äì20‚Äì0. Wiemers resigned on November 16, 2006, leaving Emporia State with a record of 35‚Äì32‚Äì0 ().

On September 1, 2007, the Hornets opened the season with a 7‚Äì3 win over the Western State Colorado Mountaineers, securing his' first win as a coach at his alma mater. Higgins led the Hornets to their first 3‚Äì0 season since 2003, but that quickly ended once they began conference play losing their final eight games. The Hornets finished 3‚Äì8 overall, 1‚Äì8 in conference play. The following season in 2008, Higgins led the Hornets to a 4‚Äì7 overall, 2‚Äì7 in conference play season with their only two conference wins against Fort Hays State and Truman. During his third year as head coach of the Hornets, Higgins led his team to the program's lowest overall winning record since 1980 ‚Äì 2‚Äì8. The next season, however, Higgins turned the program around and finished the next two seasons 5‚Äì6 overall, and 3‚Äì6 in conference play.  2012 and 2013 seasons  During his sixth season at Emporia State, the university had undergone a leadership change. With the new leadership change, came a new atmosphere on campus and Higgins led the Hornets to their first winning season since 2003. The Hornets started the season off strong winning their first eight games ‚Äì the program's first since 1988 ‚Äì earning them national rankings as well for the first time since 2003. In the first five games, the Hornets scored 30+ points per game. Finishing 10‚Äì2 overall, 9‚Äì2 in conference play led Higgins to secure a second- place finish in the MIAA and a bid to the Kanza Bowl where they defeated the Texas A&M;‚ÄìKingsville Javelinas 45‚Äì38. Quarterback Tyler Eckenrode finished his career at Emporia State with school records and as a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy. After a successful season and losing a record-breaking quarterback, the Hornets were chosen to finish in seventh place in the MIAA preseason polls. The Hornets also were starting to receive votes for national rankings, as well. Higgins led the Hornets to another 8‚Äì0 start, scoring 35+ points a game. The No. 10 Hornets' winning streak was again snapped to the Northwest Missouri State Bearcats. The Hornets won their next game after against Washburn. Finishing regular season play, Higgins led the Hornets to a 9‚Äì1 overall, 9‚Äì1 in conference play, advancing to the NCAA Playoffs for the first time since 2003. The Hornets lost to the Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth Bulldogs 55‚Äì13.  2014 and 2015 seasons  Missouri Western Griffons in 2015 Starting his eighth season, the Hornets began the year ranked No. 22 in the preseason AFCA poll. Facing injuries from last season, the Hornets started off with a win against Missouri Southern. Following the first win of the season, the Hornets moved to No. 19 in the polls, but would quickly decline after losing the next two games. The Hornets would go on to win the next two games, but would then lose the next two. The Hornets won one more before losing the last two games, finishing the season 4‚Äì7 both overall and in conference play. After having their first losing season since 2011, Higgins was quickly able to get the program winning again during his ninth season. The Hornets started the season 6‚Äì0, scoring 38+ points in the first five games, and quickly regained their national rankings after being unranked for a year. The second game of the season against Central Missouri was suspended at halftime due to severe weather. At the time the game was suspended, the Hornets were tied with the Mules at 24. The Hornets defeated the Mules two days later 45‚Äì34. In the last four games of the season, the Hornets went 3‚Äì1, losing to Northwest Missouri State again. Finishing the regular season play, Higgins led the Hornets to a 9‚Äì2 overall and in conference play. The Hornets once again returned to the NCAA playoffs winning the first two games, and falling to Northwest Missouri State in the third round. Quarterback Brent Wilson was a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy, making him the second Hornet in three years to be named a finalist.  2016 season  Starting in his tenth season with the Hornets, Higgins began the season with Northwest Missouri State ‚Äì the first time two nationally ranked teams kicked off the football season inside Francis G. Welch Stadium since it opened in 1937. After Wilson graduated, the quarterback position was open. Higgins selected a redshirt sophomore who had played in during his freshman year when both Wilson and the back-up quarterback were injured. Emporia State opened the season ranked No. 24 nationally and lost its first game against No. 1 and eventual National Champion Northwest Missouri State. From there, the Hornets won the rest of the regular season play finishing the regular season ranked No. 9 and a 10‚Äì1 overall and in conference play record. The Hornets also hosted an NCAA Division II playoff game for the first time in school history (the last playoff game was in 1989 for the NAIA where Higgins was a player). In the first game, the Hornets defeated Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth 59‚Äì26, and ended the season in the second round to Northwest Missouri State 44‚Äì13.

Welch Stadium serves as home to the Hornets football team. The stadium, which is named for long‚Äìtime Emporia State football coach and athletic director Fran Welch, opened in 1947 and since then has gone under a few renovations. In 1994, the east and west side concession areas, restroom facilities, and entrances were renovated, a new scoreboard was hoisted into place at the south end of the stadium and a new landscaped fence was erected. In 1997, the Hutchinson Family Pavilion, a three‚Äìtiered facility which has enclosed theatre seating on the first floor, a president‚Äôs box and four sky‚Äìboxes on the second floor, and a game‚Äìday management and media center on the third floor was built. The current seating capacity is 7,000. Silent Joe The \\"Silent Joe\\" Bell Tower The bell tower adjacent to the football stadium is known as \\"Silent Joe.\\" The bell, which weighs approximately 1,400 pounds, was first used in 1855 and hung in the original KSN administration building until 1880. In 1880 when the former administration building was razed, the bell was kept in storage until the present bell tower was completed in August 1939. The plan was for the bell to be rung only after a school victory. The 1939 Hornet football squad was expected to be a ‚Äúsuperteam.‚Äù Some optimists speculated the bell would be worn out halfway through the season, but after the first two games that season, the contrary became apparent. After that, the bell was known as ‚ÄúSilent Joe.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù was chosen because it was a common label for male students then.

In 1923 when the Emporia State was named to the Kansas State Teachers College, the athletic teams were known as the \\"Yaps\\". Many people not like the name, most notably Emporia State coach Vic Trusler. Trusler suggested to Cecil Carle of the Emporia Gazette that the university's athletic teams should be called the \\"Yellow Jackets\\". However, the name changed to \\"Hornets\\" due to the lack of newspaper space. In 1933, the Teachers College had a student contest where students and staff could design a mascot for the college. Sophomore Paul Edwards, who graduated in 1937, designed Corky. Although hundreds of drawings were submitted, Edwards' Corky, a \\"human-like\\" hornet was selected. Corky was published in The Bulletin, the student newspaper for Emporia State University. == Notable players == * Ross Bjork ‚Äì fullback from 1991 to 1994; now an NCAA Division I athletic director * Dale Burnett ‚Äì Former New York Giants player and was on 1932 World Championship team * John Davis ‚Äì former player for the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Minnesota Vikings * Kelly Goodburn ‚Äì Former Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Redskins player; played in Super Bowl XXIV with Washington * Leon Lett ‚Äì helped Hornets to the NAIA National Championship game in 1989; played for Dallas Cowboys in 3 Super Bowls * Bob Leahy ‚Äì played for the Pittsburgh Steelers * John Lohmeyer ‚Äì player for the Kansas City Chiefs * Brian Shay ‚Äì 1998 Harlon Hill Trophy winner; broke 17 NCAA Division II records * Austin Willis ‚Äì football player ==References * Category:American football teams established in 1893 Category:1893 establishments in Kansas ","title":"Emporia State Hornets football"},{"id":"19349293","text":"Anthony Charles \\"Tony\\" Foottit (born 28 June 1935) was the Bishop of Lynn from 1999 to 2003.Number 10 ‚Äì Announcement of resignation Footrit was educated at Lancing College and King's College, Cambridge.\\"Foottit, Rt Rev.

AB Sports was created by AB Groupe to be the sports channel of its AB Sat satellite package. However, the channel was too expensive for AB Groupe to run and had generated poor viewing figures because of its programming focusing heavily on foreign sports. AB Groupe sold 51% of the capital of AB Sports for 39 million Franc to Path√©, then launched thematic television channels. Path√© eventually renamed the channel under their own branding, to Path√© Sport in May 1999, with its programming focusing more on the French public, which made the channel gain some notoriety due to that, the live coverage of sport events and the variety of sports they offered. The acquisition of Eurosport France by the TF1 Group at the beginning of 2001 and the subsequent decision of the Canal+ Group to launch a new sports channel in the autumn of 2002, created a more competitive context in the sports rights market which jeopardized the development plan by Path√© Sport. Path√© sold 60% of the channel's capital in March 2002 to Canal+ Group,Path√© Sport, cha√Æne sportive de Canal + publi√© dans Strat√©gies Magazine and eventually the remaining 40% on 26 October of the same year, in exchange for 80% of the capital of T√©l√© Monte Carlo. The operation allowed Canal+ Group to get back a sports channel it had lost since the absorption of Eurosport France, of which it was a shareholder, by TF1 S.A.. The channel again changed its name to Sport+ on October 26, 2002. When beIN Sports launched in the country in 2012 and took over various events Sport+ used to have rights to, the channel started to struggle behind this new competition. It eventually ceased broadcasting on June 27, 2015. ==Programming== In its final year of operations, Sport+ broadcast the German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, Major League Soccer, Brazilian Serie A, UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (football), Davis Cup, Fed Cup and French ATP 250 tournaments (tennis), French Pro D2, Super Rugby, The Rugby Championship, Currie Cup and ITM Cup (rugby union), LNB Pro A and Liga ACB (basketball), GP2 Series, World Rally Championship and Formula E (motorsport), PGA Tour, European Tour and Ryder Cup (golf), French women's handball championship, National Hockey League, and UCI cycli-cross, BMX, track cycling and women's road cycling. The channel previously covered the Wimbledon Championships, ATP World Tour Finals and ATP Masters 1000 (tennis), National Football League, National Basketball Association, UEFA Europa League (football), English Premiership Rugby, EHF Champions League and LNH Division 1 (handball) and UCI road cycling. However, beIN Sports eventually took over those events and is one of the reasons caused for the channel's closure. ==References * Category:Defunct French television channels Category:Sports television networks Category:Groupe Canal+ Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2015 Category:Sports television in France Category:1996 establishments in France Category:2015 disestablishments in France ","title":"Sport+ (French TV channel)"},{"id":"19349317","text":"Chase Island is a Baffin Island offshore island located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the territory of Nunavut.

The FCEDA exists to promote investment and business growth in Fairfax County in order to expand the commercial tax base that helps pay for public services such as the county school system, police and fire departments, parks, libraries and social services. The FCEDA does this by managing marketing programs that encourage businesses to expand or relocate to the county. It is the largest non-state economic development authority in the nation. Since its founding in 1964, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority has worked with more than 3,500 companies that added more than 230,000 jobs and leased more 71 million square feet of office space in Fairfax County.Fairfax County, Virginia Fact Sheet In addition to its marketing programs, the FCEDA provides assistance to existing and new Fairfax County businesses by locating office space, providing market information, linking entrepreneurs with potential investors, and providing liaison services between businesses and Fairfax County regulatory agencies. The FCEDA also offers monthly workshops for entrepreneurs interested in starting or expanding a business in Fairfax County. Other programs target foreign-owned and small, minority- and woman-owned businesses. The FCEDA's headquarters are in the Tysons Corner area of Fairfax County, with satellite offices located in Los Angeles, Boston, Bangalore, Munich, London, Seoul and Tel Aviv. ==Early history== An advertisement for Fairfax County which ran in The Wall Street Journal. In 1956 the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors formed an advisory group on economic development called the Industrial Development Commission. This group existed until 1964 when the Virginia General Assembly acted to create the Fairfax County Industrial Development Authority. The legislature changed the name to the Economic Development Authority in 1973. Acting on concerns about population increases and funding of county services, the Board of Supervisors in the late 1970s tasked the FCEDA with its mission to create a business retention and attraction campaign that formed the basis of the EDA's current programs and purpose. In his book \\"Internet Alley: High Technology in Tysons Corner, 1945-2005,\\" (The MIT Press, 2008), Paul E. Ceruzzi summarizes two critical events in the history of Fairfax County economic development: the production of the \\"Noman Cole Report\\" and the first salvo in what would become an international advertising strategy executed by the Economic Development Authority. Ceruzzi explains that in 1976 the newly elected chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Jack Herrity, commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel for the purpose of examining the county's existing ordinances and policies related to industrial development and growth. The panel, named for its chairman, Noman Cole, produced a report entitled the \\"Committee to Study the Means of Encouraging Industrial Development in Fairfax County.\\" The Board of Supervisors charged the Economic Development Authority with developing a business attraction and retention program. Earle Williams, one of the contributors to the report, joined the FCEDA Commission around this time and argued for a large increase in the authority's marketing budget. As part of the marketing strategy, the authority bought a two-page ad in The Wall Street Journal, the cost of which was beyond anything that group had ever done, as Ceruzzi notes,.High Technology in Tysons Corner, 1945-2005, pp.118-120 These early forays into advertising were preludes to what would become a robust global advertising effort that would establish Fairfax County as a \\"brand\\" unto itself. The combined impact of pro- growth policies and the attraction and retention campaign (led by the FCEDA advertising program) would prompt Time magazine columnist Justin Fox in 2007 to call Fairfax County \\"one of the great economic success stories of our time\\". Also in 2007, a study called the Long Island Index compared the satisfaction of residents of Long Island and northern Virginia around subjects including local taxes and public services. The survey found that 89 percent of Fairfax County residents were satisfied with the quality of local services and that nearly two out of three northern Virginia residents (Fairfax and Loudoun counties) were satisfied with the value of their property taxes in terms of what they receive in local services. The study also found that 91 percent of Fairfax or Loudoun residents rate their counties as good places to live. Residents in the Virginia counties ranked services, governance and quality of life much higher than did residents of Long Island. ==Recent history== In 2005 Site Selection Magazine named the FCEDA to its list of top economic development groups for the EDA's successful efforts to expand the number of defense contractors and research organizations in the county. Because of its location near the nation's capital, the county has had a large base of government contractors, particularly in the defense and intelligence sectors. Companies in Fairfax County receive more in federal spending than any other county or city in the U.S. In fiscal 2015, companies received $23.1 billion in procurement dollars, about two-thirds of which was related to Department of Defense projects. Since the turn of the century, however, the FCEDA has made diversification of the county economy one of its major goals. Balancing this employment base with companies not reliant on government procurement became an even more imperative goal in light of federal spending cuts following the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008. Major corporate relocations involving companies not reliant on federal spending included: * Volkswagen Group of America, 2007 * Hilton Worldwide, 2009 * Bechtel, 2011 * Intelsat, 2013 Also, Cvent announced in 2015 that it would maintain its headquarters in Fairfax County rather than move elsewhere. Major defense-related companies or those with significant federal procurement ties also announced they would relocate their headquarters to Fairfax County in this time frame, including: * Computer Sciences Corporation, 2008 * SAIC, 2009 * Northrop Grumman, 2010 In 2008 the Washington, D.C.-based International Economic Development Council (IEDC), the largest professional association of economic development practitioners in the world, recognized FCEDA with its 2008 Excellence in Economic Development Award for the FCEDA-produced ‚ÄúPower of Ideas‚Äù advertising campaign. The FCEDA received honorable mentions in two other IEDC awards categories in 2008: \\"Technology-Based Economic Development Program\\" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents and the \\"Special Event\\" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents, for the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy.alt=Statistics Video In April 2010, FCEDA launched a new advertising campaign designed to promote the county's rich quality of life. The 30-second TV commercial, called ‚ÄúStatistics,‚Äù uses brightly animated statistical information on the county ‚Äì presented through pie charts and other familiar visuals from business presentations ‚Äì and morphs those shapes into real-life representations of various quality-of-life elements of Fairfax County. The yellow bar of a bar graph becomes a woman's clutch, for example, and the blue wedge of a pie chart is transformed into a slice of pizza. The ad is posted at the FCEDA's video gallery. The TV commercial is the first produced by the FCEDA in a decade. It uses locations at George Mason University and a private home in the Fairfax County community of McLean. The spot, produced by Siddall of Richmond, Va., will run through the end of June on cable outlets in four markets ‚Äì Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. ‚Äì primarily on news and business channels. The ‚ÄúStatistics‚Äù campaign also includes print, online and mobile advertising. The ad can also be viewed on YouTube. In August 2010, the Southern Economic Development Council (SEDC, ) announced that Fairfax County won a 2010 Community Economic Development Award in recognition of its success in business attraction.http://sedc.affiniscape.com/associations/10243/files/CEDA%20Winners%20for%20Web%20site.pdf FCEDA President Gerald L. Gordon was named 2010 Virginia Business Person of the Year by Virginia Business magazine, which cited his role in helping attract major business headquarters to Fairfax, County as a key factor in their decision. Also in December, the FCEDA was cited as the top economic development project in the state when the Virginia Chamber of Commerce awarded the authority its Virginia Torchbearer award. Gordon has been named to the magazine's \\"50 most influential Virginians\\" list every year from 2013-2016. On July 26, 2014, the Silver Line, the first new Washington Metro rail line since 1991, opened in Tysons Corner, an event the FCEDA's Gordon said will help transform the area in to a \\"world-class city.\\" The first phase of the Silver Line also includes a stop in the Fairfax County community of Reston. ==Governance== The FCEDA operates under the direction of seven commissioners, who are local business people appointed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. The commissioners govern and oversee the FCEDA's policies and programs. Commissioners serve for four-year terms and hire the FCEDA president, who since 1987 has been Gerald L. Gordon, Ph.D. Gordon is the author of 12 books. His most recent, The Economic Survival of America's Isolated Small Towns, from CRC Press (2015), \\"provides a detailed discussion of the context of these towns, from the internal challenges that isolate them and force independent action to the extent to which they can rely on neighboring or other macro-level resources.\\" The book is the fourth in a series penned by Gordon and published by CRC Press. ==Research and Conferences== The authority conducts research and stages conferences to ‚Äúbetter understand broad workplace trends that impact businesses in Fairfax County and across the country.‚Äù The FCEDA organized the 1998 World Conference on Information Technology. Presented by the World Information Technology and Services Alliance and held at George Mason University in Fairfax, the World Congress attracted about 1,900 technology executives and government officials from around the world to discuss trends in the burgeoning information technology sectors. Speakers included former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Computers. Having the conference located in Fairfax County spotlighted the county as a technology business location. In September 2007, FCEDA commissioned Ipsos, an independent research firm, to undertake a national poll on creativity in the workplace. The poll found that, while an overwhelming majority of American workers believe they are instinctively creative, fewer than two in three think they are tapping their creative capacities on the job. The results of the national survey were reported on by such publications as the Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor and Washington Post. The poll results were published in advance of the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy, a conference presented by the FCEDA. The conference program included keynote addresses from Richard Florida, Thomas Friedman and Alvin Toffler. File:Thomas Friedman Key Note Address at the National Conference on the Creative Economy.jpgThomas Friedman File:Richard Florida.jpgRichard Florida File:Alvin Toffler.jpgAlvin Toffler In October 2008, the FCEDA commissioned a new survey through Ipsos that examined American workers' opinions of technology in the workplace. The survey found that an overwhelming majority of U.S. workers place a high value on technology in the workplace, so much so that almost 40 percent of employees across the labor force would consider changing jobs to work for an organization that is more committed to providing access to and training in the latest technology. Results of the survey were covered by the Associated Press, the Washington Post and the Fox Business Network. In May 2009, the FCEDA partnered with Ipsos once again. This time, FCEDA chose to examine issues facing communities that, like Fairfax County, after a long period of suburbanization and increased density, are in transition to a more urban environment. The survey revealed that \\"living or working in the suburbs might not be all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be.\\" Of the one in three (32%) Americans who reportedly live in a suburban environment, a majority (51%) wishes their community had more of a wide variety of offerings. The results of survey were released ahead of the FCEDA conference: ‚ÄúThe New Urban Economic Model: The Transformation of Fairfax County\\" and was picked up by the Washington Business Journal, WTOP and WMAL radio. The conference featured keynote addresses by Urban Land Institute Senior Resident Fellow (and former Indianapolis mayor) William Hudnut and Brookings Institution urban policy scholar Anthony Downs. In Sept. 2012, the FCEDA presented a symposium titled America‚Äôs Aging Workforce, which featured talks from industry and government leaders from the Washington, D.C., area and beyond on a variety of topics related to issues and opportunities presented by demographic shifts in the U.S. workforce. According to FCEDA CEO Gerald Gordon, the number of workers 65 and over will increase 75 percent to 70 million in the next 18 years. Also presented at the conference were results from a survey looking at how younger and older workers view those demographic shifts. Despite the changing demographics, the research found that different generations value each other's contributions, according to Forbes. Presenters at the conference included John Berry, director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM); John W. Martin, president and CEO of the Southeaster Institute of Research (SIR), co-founder of the Boomer Project and author of Boomer Consumer; Danny Felty, M.D., a healthy-aging expert at HCA Virginia Health System and executives from Fairfax County companies Capital One, Volkswagen Group of America and Balfour Beatty. ==References *FCEDA Website *Fairfax County Government website *Washington Post article by Kim Hart: \\"More Foreign Firms Calling Fairfax Home\\" *FCEDA Annual Report *FCEDA Year End Real Estate Report *Fairfax County Profile *Fairfax County/Ipsos National Survey Category:Economy of Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Local government in Virginia Category:Government in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:1964 establishments in Virginia Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Economic development organizations in the United States ","title":"Fairfax County Economic Development Authority"},{"id":"19349376","text":"This is a list of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins head coaches.

This figure illustrates positive apsidal precession (advance of the perihelion), with the orbital axis turning in the same direction as the planet's orbital motion. The eccentricity of this ellipse and the precession rate of the orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much lower eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and stationary. The main orbital elements (or parameters). The line of apsides is shown in blue, and denoted by . The apsidal precession is the rate of change of through time, . Animation of Moon orbit around Earth - Polar view In celestial mechanics, apsidal precession (or apsidal advance) is the precession (gradual rotation) of the line connecting the apsides (line of apsides) of an astronomical body's orbit. The apsides are the orbital points closest (periapsis) and farthest (apoapsis) from its primary body. The apsidal precession is the first time derivative of the argument of periapsis, one of the six main orbital elements of an orbit. Apsidal precession is considered positive when the orbit's axis rotates in the same direction as the orbital motion. An apsidal period is the time interval required for an orbit to precess through 360¬∞. ==History== The ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchos noted the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit; it is corrected for in the Antikythera Mechanism (circa 80 BCE) with the almost exactly accurate value of 8.88 years per full cycle, correct within 0.34%. The precession of the solar apsides was discovered in the eleventh century by al-ZarqƒÅlƒ´., at pp. 314‚Äì317. The lunar apsidal precession was not accounted for in Claudius Ptolemy's Almagest, and as a group these precessions, the result of a plethora of phenomena, remained difficult to account for until the 20th century when the last unidentified part of Mercury's precession was precisely explained in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. ==Calculation== A variety of factors can lead to periastron precession such as general relativity, stellar quadrupole moments, mutual star‚Äìplanet tidal deformations, and perturbations from other planets. : For Mercury, the perihelion precession rate due to general relativistic effects is 43‚Ä≥ (arcseconds) per century. By comparison, the precession due to perturbations from the other planets in the Solar System is 532‚Ä≥ per century, whereas the oblateness of the Sun (quadrupole moment) causes a negligible contribution of 0.025‚Ä≥ per century. From classical mechanics, if stars and planets are considered to be purely spherical masses, then they will obey a simple inverse-square law, relating force to distance and hence execute closed elliptical orbits according to Bertrand's theorem. Non-spherical mass effects are caused by the application of external potential(s): the centrifugal potential of spinning bodies like the spinning of pizza dough causes flattening between the poles and the gravity of a nearby mass raises tidal bulges. Rotational and net tidal bulges create gravitational quadrupole fields () that lead to orbital precession. Total apsidal precession for isolated very hot Jupiters is, considering only lowest order effects, and broadly in order of importance : with planetary tidal bulge being the dominant term, exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude. The good resulting approximation of the tidal bulge is useful for understanding the interiors of such planets. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year. It is up to 19.9¬∞ per year for WASP-12b. ==Newton's theorem of revolving orbits== Newton derived an early theorem which attempted to explain apsidal precession. This theorem is historically notable, but it was never widely used and it proposed forces which have been found not to exist, making the theorem invalid. This theorem of revolving orbits remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries until 1995.Chandrasekhar, p. 183. Newton proposed that variations in the angular motion of a particle can be accounted for by the addition of a force that varies as the inverse cube of distance, without affecting the radial motion of a particle. Using a forerunner of the Taylor series, Newton generalized his theorem to all force laws provided that the deviations from circular orbits are small, which is valid for most planets in the Solar System.. However, his theorem did not account for the apsidal precession of the Moon without giving up the inverse- square law of Newton's law of universal gravitation. Additionally, the rate of apsidal precession calculated via Newton's theorem of revolving orbits is not as accurate as it is for newer methods such as by perturbation theory. change in orbit over time Effects of apsidal precession on the seasons with the eccentricity and ap/peri-helion in the orbit exaggerated for ease of viewing. The seasons shown are in the northern hemisphere and the seasons will be reverse in the southern hemisphere at any given time during orbit. Some climatic effects follow chiefly due to the prevalence of more oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. ==General relativity== An apsidal precession of the planet Mercury was noted by Urbain Le Verrier in the mid-19th century and accounted for by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Einstein showed that for a planet, the major semi-axis of its orbit being , the eccentricity of the orbit and the period of revolution , then the apsidal precession due to relativistic effects, during one period of revolution in radians, is :\\\\varepsilon = 24 \\\\pi^3 \\\\frac{a^2}{T^2 c^2 \\\\left(1-e^2\\\\right)} where is the speed of light. In the case of Mercury, half of the greater axis is about , the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.206 and the period of revolution 87.97 days or . From these and the speed of light (which is ~), it can be calculated that the apsidal precession during one period of revolution is = radians ( degrees or 0.104‚Ä≥). In one hundred years, Mercury makes approximately 415 revolutions around the Sun, and thus in that time, the apsidal perihelion due to relativistic effects is approximately 43‚Ä≥, which corresponds almost exactly to the previously unexplained part of the measured value. ==Long-term climate== The Earth's apsidal precession slowly increases its argument of periapsis; it takes about years for the ellipse to revolve once relative to the fixed stars. The Earth's polar axis, and hence the solstices and equinoxes, precess with a period of about years in relation to the fixed stars. These two forms of 'precession' combine so that it takes between and years (and on average years) for the ellipse to revolve once relative to the vernal equinox, that is, for the perihelion to return to the same date (given a calendar that tracks the seasons perfectly). This interaction between the anomalistic and tropical cycle is important in the long-term climate variations on Earth, called the Milankovitch cycles. An equivalent is also known on Mars. The figure to the right illustrates the effects of precession on the northern hemisphere seasons, relative to perihelion and aphelion. Notice that the areas swept during a specific season changes through time. Orbital mechanics require that the length of the seasons be proportional to the swept areas of the seasonal quadrants, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons on the far side of the orbit may be substantially longer in duration. ==See also== * Axial precession * Nodal precession * Hypotrochoid * Rosetta (orbit) * Spirograph == Notes == Category:Orbits Category:Precession ","title":"Apsidal precession"},{"id":"19349422","text":"Hyun Hee (born October 4, 1976 in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) is a retired South Korean √©p√©e fencer.

On 13 August 2008, Vyeramko was one of the key players for BATE Borisov in the Belarusians' away game against Bulgarian side Levski Sofia (third qualifying round of the Champions League), parrying a Georgi Ivanov shot from the penalty spot (the penalty kick had been awarded after a Veremko foul on Georgi Hristov) and making a number of other notable saves to deny the Levski Sofia forwards. The match ended 0:1 and a 1:1 home draw in Barysaw was sufficient to see the Belarusians progress to the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in their history. (Vyeramko did not play in the home leg due to a suspension attributable to accumulated yellow cards). However, Vyeramko was the starting goalkeeper in all of his team's games in the UEFA Champions League group stage, earning himself 1 yellow card during the Belarusians' 1:1 away draw against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg on 21 October 2008 (after a mild altercation with Portuguese forward Danny). On 9 April 2009, Vyeramko was shown a red card in the 17th minute of BATE Borisov's 0:1 away loss to FC Naftan Novopolotsk in a Belarusian Cup game for handling the ball outside his penalty area. During the 2010 season, Vyeramko managed to keep a clean sheet in his first 6 games, but was subsequently injured. On 19 May 2010, he returned to first team action in the 1:0 home win against Dinamo Brest. Remarkably, he conceded his first goals for the season in the 1:2 home loss against FC Minsk on 13 June 2010. In the process, Vyeramko set a Belarusian Premier League record by keeping a clean sheet for 1016 consecutive minutes. His record lasted until June 2015 when it was eclipsed by another BATE Borisov player (Syarhey Chernik) who went 1073 minutes without allowing a goal. In September 2010, Vyeramko managed to save three successive penalties that he faced ‚Äì on 16 September 2010, he denied Artem Milevskiy from the spot in the 2:2 away draw against Dynamo Kyiv in a UEFA Europa League game, on 22 September 2010, he parried a penalty that was taken by Stanislaw Drahun in the 1:3 home loss against Dinamo Minsk in a Belarusian Premier League match, and on 30 September 2010, he was up to the task against AZ Alkmaar's Jonathas in the 4:1 home win in a UEFA Europa League match. During his first stay with the team from Borisov, Veremko appeared in 118 matches in total - 71 in the league, 15 in the Belarusian Cup, 1 in the Belarusian Super Cup, 19 in the Champions League, and 12 in the UEFA Europa League.  PFC Sevastopol  In early January 2011, it was revealed that Vyeramko will sign a 2.5 year contract with Ukrainian Premier League side PFC Sevastopol, with the player claiming that he had reached the limit for his professional development in the Belarusian Premier League. The transfer was finalized on 14 January 2011. On 25 January 2011, Vyeramko made his unofficial debut for his new team, playing the first half of the 1:1 draw with Kazakh side FC Shakhter Karagandy. His official debut came on 3 March 2011, in the 0:1 home loss against table leaders FC Shakhtar Donetsk, with Veremko playing the full 90 minutes. Veremko quickly established himself as a starter for the side, but the team was relegated to the Ukrainian First League at the end of the season.  Krylya Sovetov Samara  In late July 2011, he signed a three-year contract with Russian club FC Krylya Sovetov, being envisioned as a replacement for Ra√Øs M'Bolhi. On 1 August 2011, Vyeramko debuted as a starter in the 1:1 home draw with Amkar Perm in a Russian Premier League match. In December 2011, he was selected as Krylya Sovetov's 2011 player of the year, with fellow Belarusian Sergei Kornilenko coming in second place. Veremko was also given the captain's armband on a full-time basis by manager Andrey Kobelev. On 24 July 2012, Veremko extended his contract with the Samara team until 2016. During the second half of the 2013‚Äì14 Russian Premier League season, Veremko faced competition for the goalkeeping spot from J√°n Mucha and Denis Vavilin. He left the team in early July 2014, after it had been relegated from the Russian Premier League.  Ufa  On 10 July 2014, Veremko signed a one-year loan contract with newly promoted Russian Premier League club Ufa. On 3 August 2014, Vyeramko made his first appearance in a competitive match in the 0:2 league loss against Kuban Krasnodar. He struggled to become a regular first team player, making only 5 league appearances.  Levadiakos  On 28 August 2015, Veremko signed a one-year loan contract with Greek Super League club Levadiakos. He made his official debut on 28 October, in a 0:3 loss against Panathinaikos in a Greek Cup match.  Return to BATE Borisov  On 1 July 2016, Veremko rejoined BATE Borisov, which was shortly after the departure of Syarhey Chernik who had signed for Nancy. He kept a clean sheet on his return debut, a 2:0 win over Finnish side SJK Sein√§joki in the first leg of a second qualifying round Champions League match held on 12 July, repeating the performance in his comeback match in the Belarusian Premier League on 29 July against Dinamo Brest, which also finished in a 2:0 win for the team from Barysaw.  FC Minsk  In January 2018, Veremko reached an agreement with Minsk, signing a contract with the team. He made his debut on 30 March 2018, in the 0:0 draw with Luch Minsk in a league match. ==International career== Belarus in 2012. Since 2008 Vyeramko has been a regular member of the Belarus national football team. On 2 February 2008, Vyeramko made his debut for the national side in the 2:0 win against Iceland, which was the opening match of the unofficial Malta International Football Tournament 2008. His first stint between the sticks in a competitive game was in the 3:1 away win against Andorra on 10 September 2008 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier, with Vyeramko only conceding after a penalty kick. On 3 March 2010, Vyeramko earned his third cap in the 3:1 win against Armenia in a friendly match. On 26 March 2011, Vyeramko started in net in the Euro 2012 away qualifier against Albania due to an injury to first choice goalkeeper Yuri Zhevnov and made a number of good saves, though the only goal of the game was scored after a misunderstanding between him and defender Alyaksandr Martynovich. During Bernd Stange's tenure as head coach Veremko was mostly the second choice goalkeeper, but he became a starter after Georgi Kondratiev was appointed as manager. On 15 August 2012, he captained his country for the first time in the 2:1 win over Armenia in a friendly match. Veremko retained the captain's armband for the first two 2014 World Cup qualifiers ‚Äì against Georgia and France. Veremko played in 7 of Belarus' 8 matches during the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign (remaining on the substitute's bench only for the last match of the qualifiers - a 1:2 away loss against Spain). Timofei Kalachev took over the captain's armband for the Euro 2016 qualifiers. ==Honours== BATE Borisov *Belarusian Premier League champion: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2016, 2017 *Belarusian Cup winner: 2009‚Äì10 *Belarusian Super Cup winner: 2010, 2017 Individual *Best goalkeeper in the Belarusian Premier League ‚Äì 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 (holds record for most individual awards won) *Listed among the 22 best players in the Belarusian Premier League by the Belarusian Football Federation ‚Äì 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 *FC Krylya Sovetov player of the year ‚Äì 2011 ==Personal life== Vyeramko is married and has a daughter and a son. ==References* Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Belarusian footballers Category:Belarus international footballers Category:Belarusian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Belarusian expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:FC Dinamo Minsk players Category:FC Dinamo-Juni Minsk players Category:FC Sevastopol players Category:FC Arsenal Kharkiv players Category:FC Helios Kharkiv players Category:FC Kharkiv players Category:FC BATE Borisov players Category:FC Neman Grodno players Category:FC Krylia Sovetov Samara players Category:FC Ufa players Category:Levadiakos F.C. players Category:FC Minsk players ","title":"Syarhey Vyeramko"},{"id":"19349496","text":"M.

He served as a government Minister and Governor of Logar Province. == Biography == Abdullah Wardak, an ethnic Pashtun, was born in the Wardak Province of Afghanistan. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan he fought as a Mujahideen. He was aligned with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's Islamic Union for the liberation of Afghanistan party. When the Taliban came to power he fought against them as part of the Northern Alliance. He fought alongside the American forces in 2001, helping to overthrow the Taliban regime. In December 2001, following the Bonn Agreement, Abdullah Wardak was appointed Minister of Martyrs and Disabled in the Afghan Transitional Administration of Hamid Karzai. A position he held until a new Cabinet was selected in December 2004 following the presidential election. In July 2007 he was appointed Governor of Logar Province, replacing Sayed Abdul Karim Hashimi, who was perceived as being ineffective on counter-insurgency measures. In January 2005 Abdullah Wardak visited Evansville, Indiana and spoke at the Bethel Temple Community Church. He spoke about the war in Afghanistan and how he was helping the church to open a school, an orphanage and a home for widows in Kabul. He received the key to the city from Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel. == Assassination == On the morning of 13 September 2008 Abdullah Wardak left his residence in Paghman and was being driven to his office. It was whilst his vehicle was crossing a dry river bed that a remote control mine was detonated. The car was destroyed and Abdullah Wardak, his driver and two bodyguards were killed. The attack happened at around 08:00 local time, approximately 300 yards from Abdullah Wardak's home. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the bomb had been remotely detonated by two Taliban insurgents. Abdullah Wardak is the second provincial Governor to be assassinated by the Taliban. The first was the Governor of Paktia Province, Hakim Taniwal in September 2006. President Hamid Karzai condemned the assassination by \\"terrorists\\" and was said to be \\"deeply saddened\\" he described Abdullah Wardak as a \\"true son of Afghanistan\\". Zemarai Bashary a spokesman for the Interior ministry said \\"The Governor has been martyred\\". On 14 September 2008 Abdullah Wardak's funeral was held at the mosque in Pajak village, Paghman District, he was buried in the grounds of his home. The funeral was held amid tight security and attended by government officials and members of the United National Front. == References  External links == *Abdullah Wardak at ISN Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1950s births Category:2008 deaths Category:Pashtun people Category:Afghan Muslims Category:Governors of Logar Province Category:Mujahideen members of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War Category:Government ministers of Afghanistan Category:Assassinated Afghan politicians Category:Afghan terrorism victims Category:Terrorism deaths in Afghanistan Category:Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan politicians Category:People killed by the Taliban ","title":"Abdullah Wardak"},{"id":"19349544","text":"Daphne and Celeste are an American pop duo, consisting of Celeste Cruz and Karen 'Daphne' DiConcetto. Three of their singles reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. ==Success and album reaction== They released three singles in the UK: \\"Ooh Stick You\\", \\"U.G.L.Y.\\" and a cover version of Alice Cooper's \\"School's Out\\". A full-length album, We Didn't Say That!, was released in June 2000 to generally mixed reviews (Melody Maker awarded it four out of five stars). Another single, \\"Party\\", was due in November 2000, but was never released. During their performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2000, the crowd's negative reception towards Daphne and Celeste's incongruous music resulted in the duo being bottled by the audience. Despite the hostile crowd response, Daphne and Celeste remained on stage and continued to perform their songs though they left at the end of their second song in a three-song set due to the increasing crowd hostility. \\"U.G.L.Y.\\" was criticised by those who felt that it promoted bullying. Daphne and Celeste countered this by saying their lyrics were meant to be tongue-in-cheek. In an interview included on the \\"U.G.L.Y.\\" single, Daphne stated: \\"Everyone is indeed ugly in their own special way.\\" Daphne and Celeste made an appearance at Feet First. Daphne and Celeste also had a television and film deal. Daphne and Celeste were eventually dropped by their label. Their official website closed down in October 2001, and their management company, Perfect Noise Limited, was dissolved in November 2002. After the band broke up Celeste went back to school. ==Later activities== In a \\"Where Are They Now?\\" interview with Q magazine in 2005, Karen DiConcetto stated that the whole project was \\"100% manufactured\\", and that the girls auditioned for it in New York in 1998: \\"I just talked about shoes for an hour.\\" She considered the Reading Festival to be the highlight of the whole experience, and mentioned her work in theatre afterwards, specifically a play called Tourrettaville, written by a boy with Tourette's syndrome. DiConcetto received positive reviews for her portrayal of \\"CB's Sister\\" in the FringeNYC award-winning Peanuts spoof Dog Sees God. That production was adapted for an Off-Broadway debut featuring a number of big- name celebrities, including Eliza Dushku and America Ferrera. In the same interview, Celeste Cruz said that she had also worked in theatre and that the duo were planning to break into television. In 2004, Celeste also took the role of \\"Maria\\" in the movie Brooklyn Bound. Although not a main character, she is involved in a pivotal scene which fuels the tragedy of the denouement. She also features quite prominently on the DVD cover. In 2009 she appeared in an Emmy-nominated episode of 30 Rock entitled \\"Generalissimo\\". Celeste can also be found on Twitter. Unlike DiConcetto, she considered the Reading Festival incident the \\"end of the party for us\\". Daphne and Celeste were also interviewed by Bad Horsey towards the end of 2005, with the questions coming from the B3ta web community. The interview was posted on the Estudio Caballito Malo website and featured in the Popbitch newsletter. An edited version was published in the January 2006 edition of the UK publication Fused Magazine. DiConcetto has a role in Holger Ernst's The House Is Burning, which premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival on May 26. The film was produced by Wim Wenders, and is considered a German production, despite being filmed around New Jersey. In 2005, Daphne and Celeste had a mini reunion tour in the UK with Lolly. Celeste Cruz sang guest vocals on a song for Kent Odessa. ==Reunion and recording== In 2011, English music producer Max Tundra contacted Daphne and Celeste through social media to offer his production to make a comeback. On March 29, 2015, the duo had a second reunion and released a single titled \\"You and I Alone\\", produced by Max Tundra. The song is the first single from the album Daphne & Celeste Save the World, and was written and produced by Max Tundra. On February 7, 2018, Daphne and Celeste announced the comeback album with the launch of another song, \\"BB\\", produced by Max Tundra. The duo and Tundra performed at London's Boston Music Room to promote the release. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" AUS ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" NZ ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" We Didn't Say That!  * Release date: June 26, 2000 * Label: MCA * Formats: CD  273  4  140 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Daphne & Celeste Save the World  * Release date: March 30, 2018 * Formats: CD, DL, CS, LP  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî } Singles {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Single ! colspan=\\"4\\" Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" AUS Australian (ARIA Chart) peaks: *Top 50 peaks: *Top 100 peaks: *\\"Ooh Stick You\\": *\\"School's Out\\": *We Didn't Say That!: ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" CAN ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" NZ ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" UK -  1999  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" \\"Ooh Stick You\\"  54  ‚Äî  5  8  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" We Didn't Say That! -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2000  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" \\"U.G.L.Y.\\"  40  18  7  18 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" \\"School's Out\\"  96  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  12 -  2015  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" \\"You and I Alone\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"2\\" Daphne & Celeste Save the World -  2018  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" \\"BB\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"15\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes releases that did not chart } ==References *Daphne and Celeste * * Category:American musical duos Category:American pop girl groups Category:Musical groups from New Jersey Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2002 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2015 Category:American dance music groups Category:1999 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Daphne and Celeste"},{"id":"19349573","text":"Lord McColl of Dulwich Ian McColl, Baron McColl of Dulwich, (born 6 January 1933) is a British surgeon, professor, politician and Conservative member of the House of Lords.

The motel owner informs him that all the beds are occupied and the only option he has is sleeping outside on the cot on the porch. Donald accepts, but before he can hop on the cot, the motel owner adds that it costs 16 dollars, causing Donald to angrily refuse and tie the man's arm into a knot. In response, the motel owner kicks Donald, sending him flying into his car. Donald drives deeper into the woodland and finds a spot to sleep on an air mattress. After struggling to get the mattress inflated (failing twice with a tire pump before blowing it up himself), Donald gets ready to rest but is bothered by a rock underneath the mattress. He throws the rock away sending it up to a hill, where it causes a chain reaction that sends a huge boulder towards Donald, who is woken up and panics trying to escape in his car. The boulder catches up and crushes him against a tree, causing Donald's vehicle to crunch into the shape of a 1910s Ford Model T. Donald returns to bed and falls asleep. As he snores, however, the mattress balloons, putting Donald in a vertical position sustained by his opening and closing beak, which leads Donald over a cliff and into the river below. Donald continues to slumber underwater next to a large sleeping fish that draws Donald's head near its jaws each time it inhales. Donald realizes where he is only after he and the fish struggle for the blanket and swims back to shore. The springy branch of a nearby pine tree bothers Donald in his sleep and he is smacked back by it when he tries to shove it away. Angered, Donald fixes a fallen tree branch under the pine's branch to keep it away. However, as Donald sleeps, his exhalations cause the tree branch to lose hold of the pine's branch, causing it to hit the air mattress pump (with the hose still attached to the mattress valve) and wobble up and down with the handle, pumping fast and strong. This causes Donald's mattress to get excessively inflated until it pops off and takes flight, deflating rapidly in mid-air while Donald continues to sleep. As the mattress deflates, it propels Donald all the way back to the Hold-Up Motel, landing right on the porch cot. The owner comes out, believing that Donald has spent the entire night on the cot, and asks him the 16 dollars, which Donald hands over in his sleep. Immediately after paying, the motel owner notifies Donald that his time is up and shoves Donald off of the porch and into the arms of a cactus. Despite his uncomfortable new sleeping arrangement, Donald continues to slumber as the cartoon ends. ==Credits== *Direction ‚Äì Jack King *Animation ‚Äì Don Towsley, Paul Allen, Emery Hawkins, Sandy Strother *Story ‚Äì MacDonald MacPherson, Jack Huber *Voices ‚Äì Clarence Nash (Donald Duck), Billy Bletcher (motel proprietor) *Music ‚Äì Oliver Wallace *Layout ‚Äì Don Griffith *Background ‚Äì Howard Dunn ==ReferencesCategory:1947 films Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:American films Category:Donald Duck short films Category:1947 animated films Category:Films directed by Jack King Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:1940s American animated films ","title":"Wide Open Spaces (1947 film)"},{"id":"19349577","text":"Bruce Emery Bickford (born March 12, 1957 in East Benton, Maine) is a retired long-distance runner from the United States.

The tank is filled with 10 inches of water which contains enough dissolved Epsom salt to create a specific gravity of approximately 1.275. This environment allows an individual to float effortlessly on the surface of the water. The primary function of the isolation tank is to eliminate as many of the external senses as possible. They were first used in 1954 to test the effects of sensory deprivation. ==History== The isolation tank was developed in 1954 by John C. Lilly, a medical practitioner and neuropsychiatrist. During his training in psychoanalysis at the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Lilly experimented with sensory deprivation. Widespread commercial interest and use of the isolation tank didn't occur until 1972, when Glenn Perry, a computer systems programmer, began selling the first commercial tanks after he attended a five-day workshop by Lilly. In 1981, there were about $4 million in sales and rentals in the industry, and expectations were that the market would grow, spurred by the film Altered States (a film starring William Hurt as a psychopathologist experimenting with a flotation tank), which came out in 1980. According to one source in the industry, in the 1980s the rise of AIDS and the fear of shared water reduced demand for flotation centers. By 2013, flotation was more popular in Europe than the US, but had undergone some growth in the area around San Francisco; at that time a low-end tank cost about $10,000, and an hour-long flotation session cost about $70. ==Notable users== * Carl Lewis, track and field athlete, used in-tank visualization techniques to prepare himself for his gold medal long jump at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. * Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, discussed his experiences with isolation tanks in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! * Two- time NBA MVP Stephen Curry reportedly uses a sensory-deprivation tank every two weeks. *Carl Lawson, football player for the Cincinnati Bengals, uses the tank for muscle recovery and visual training. * Joe Rogan has stated in his podcast on numerous occasions that he owns an isolation tank and credits it for allowing a state of deeper meditation.https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19546617/sensory-deprivation- tanks/ *John Lennon treated his heroin addiction in 1979 with the help of 90-minute floats in a cedar-wood box. * Several NFL teams, including the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints, reportedly use floating as a way to increase players‚Äô quality of sleep as well as help with recovery. https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/02/01/patriots-sleep-float-tanks-bill- belichick-josh-mcdaniels-tom-brady/ * During Super Bowl XLIX, both NFL teams (the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks) rented out a local float spa during the week of the event.

Formed in 2000, the group consists of Amanda Palmer (lead vocals and piano; additional: keyboards, harmonica, ukulele) and Brian Viglione (drums and percussion; additional: guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals). The two describe their style as \\"Brechtian punk cabaret\\", a phrase invented by Palmer because she was \\"terrified\\" that the press would invent a name that \\"would involve the word gothic\\". The Dresden Dolls are part of an underground dark cabaret movement that started gaining momentum in the early 2000s. == Career ==  Band formation and name  The Dresden Dolls, 2002 Photo by Kyle Cassidy The duo formed a week after Brian Viglione witnessed Amanda Palmer perform solo at a Halloween party in 2000. Their live performances soon gained them a cult following. During these performances the two band members often wore dramatic make-up and fancy clothing that pushed their cabaret/theater aesthetic. They encourage fans to become involved at their shows, with the fans' own stilt walking, living statues, fire breathers, and other performance art becoming an integral part of the show. The Dirty Business Brigade coordinated the fans' performances. The band's first name was Out of Arms. At some point, the name became The Dresden Dolls. The name, according to Palmer, was \\"inspired by a combination of things\\", including the firebombing of Dresden, Germany and the porcelain dolls that were a hallmark of pre-war Dresden industry; an early song of the same name by The Fall; and a reference to the V. C. Andrews novel Flowers in the Attic, where the classically blond-haired and blue-eyed protagonists are called \\"the Dresden dolls\\". The name also evokes Weimar Germany and its cabaret culture. Additionally, Palmer \\"liked the parallel between Dresden (destruction) and Dolls (innocence, delicacy), because it is very much in keeping with the dynamics of the music, which sometimes goes from a childlike whisper to a banshee scream within a few seconds\\".  Growing fame and performances  The duo was featured in a webcast performance at the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After a self-promoted demo recorded and released in 2001, their first release was the mostly live compilation A Is for Accident (Important Records), followed in 2003 by a self-titled debut produced and recorded by Martin Bisi (Swans, Sonic Youth) at The Old American Can Factory in Gowanus, Brooklyn after being signed to Roadrunner Records by David Bason. The album features fellow Boston-area musicians Ad Frank (guitar on \\"Good Day\\") and Shawn Setaro (bass on \\"Good Day\\", \\"Gravity\\", and \\"Jeep Song\\").The Dresden Dolls album liner notes. Two songs off the album ranked in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004: \\"Girl Anachronism\\" at number 30 and \\"Coin- Operated Boy\\" at number 12. In 2003 they were crowned the winners of Boston's long-running WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble. On October 6, 2005, The Dresden Dolls were interviewed by the subject of one of their songs, Christopher Lydon, on the radio show Open Source.  Tours, festivals, books, and theater  The Dresden Dolls, 2002 In March 2005, the duo supported Nine Inch Nails on tour. On June 5, The Dresden Dolls hosted a free concert at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. When a power outage unexpectedly delayed their performance, city streets became a temporary stage for some of the many performers (living statues, stilt-walkers, and fire-breathers) who had come from across the world to entertain audiences. The entire event‚Äîconcert and street performances‚Äîwas filmed and the resulting DVD, Live: In Paradise, was released in Europe on October 10, 2005 and in North America on November 22, shortly after the band's fall 2005 tour. The Dresden Dolls' second studio album, Yes, Virginia..., was released on April 18, 2006. Over the summer of that year, the duo performed at South by Southwest, Bonnaroo, Britain's Reading and Leeds Festivals, and Lollapalooza, in addition to touring with Panic! at the Disco as their opening act. During the support tour, the band presented \\"Fuck the Back Row‚ÄîA Night of Celluloid Vaudeville\\". The events consisted of screenings of short films from friends and fans, performances by local artists, and a solo show by Palmer who performed mostly cover songs inspired from film soundtracks. In June 2006, The Dresden Dolls Companion was released by Amanda Palmer. The book contains a history of the band and their first album‚ÄîThe Dresden Dolls‚Äîas well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, sheet music, and notes on each song on the album, as well as a DVD featuring a 20-minute interview with Palmer about the origins of the band and the first LP. The interview was conducted by a friend while Palmer compiled the artwork for the first LP. On August 16, the East Providence Community Theatre in East Providence, Rhode Island premiered a full-length, fan-written jukebox musical, The Clockwork Waltz, featuring songs from The Dresden Dolls' three albums. The show was encouraged by the band and their management. In December 2006 and January 2007, the music of The Dresden Dolls was featured in an original production‚ÄîThe Onion Cellar‚Äîat the American Repertory Theatre's Zero Arrow Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The play is co-authored by Amanda Palmer, from her original concept. On January 14, 2007, the duo took a temporary hiatus. Palmer worked on her solo album, Who Killed Amanda Palmer, while Brian Viglione toured with Boston-based HUMANWINE and other local Boston acts, along with touring with Jesse Malin and offering drum clinics. In June 2007, they joined the True Colors Tour 2007, including their debut in New York City's Radio City Music Hall and their first review in the New York Times. On July 10, 2007, the DVD Live at the Roundhouse, was released in the U.S. From December 27, 2007 to January 13, 2008, their Winter Tour started at the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington, DC, and ending at The Norva in Norfolk, Virginia. On January 15, 2008, they entered the studio to record new material for their third studio album, No, Virginia... Released on May 20, 2008, it is a collection of B-sides and rarities, along with new recordings of old favorites and cover songs that were previously only available as live versions. The album spawned the single, \\"Night Reconnaissance\\". July 2008 saw the release of the second Dresden Dolls book, the Virginia Companion. It is a follow-up to the Dresden Dolls Companion, featuring the music and lyrics from the Yes, Virginia... and No, Virginia... albums.  Hiatus  In September 2008, rumors began to circulate about the future of the whole band. Viglione confirmed that the band was on hiatus but emphasized that he and Palmer are on good terms and that they will get together again when it feels right for both of them. In late July and early August 2009, a rumor began to spread that the band was \\"reuniting for performances in 2010\\" but Palmer clarified in her blog on August 7: \\"There's been a ton of press lately re-printing an old quote from an old interview that's now blown up into a full-fledged press rumour that Brian and I have planned Dresden Dolls' shows for 2010. Not true. We aren't planning any shows. Sorry about that, blame the gossip whores.\\"  2010 reunion tour  In 2010, a reunion tour to selected venues in the United States occurred. It started on Halloween in New York City and ended in San Francisco on New Year's Eve. 2011/2012 tour The Dresden Dolls played a show in Mexico City on December 9, 2011. They had a tour of New Zealand and Australia in January 2012, supported by The Jane Austen Argument in Australia, and Hera, House of Mountain and Princess Chelsea in New Zealand. 2015 On April 15, 2015, they had a show in New York to celebrate Record Store Day and promote the release of The Virginia Monologues. 2018 On October 27 (The Dome, Tuffnel Park), 30 & 31 (The Troxy), 2018, they played three shows in London (their first shows in Europe in 12 years). 2020 On her ‚ÄòThere Will Be No Intermission‚Äô tour in 2019, Amanda Palmer announced that the Dresden Dolls will be recording and releasing a new album in 2020.

The college was located in Lima, New York, and eventually relocated to Syracuse, becoming Syracuse University. ==Genesee Wesleyan Seminary== In 1831, the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary was founded in Lima, south of Rochester, by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Rev. Dr. Samuel Luckey was elected the first Principal of the seminary, and was transferred from the New York Annual Conference to the Genesee Conference of the M.E. Church . He remained in office until 1836, when he was elected as editor of The Christian Advocate and Journal, an important periodical for the M.E. General Conference. The institution is said to have \\"opened most favorably,\\" with a total enrollment of 341 the first year (1831‚Äì32), with 170-180 students attending at any one time. The Agents of the seminary solicited funds for the construction of buildings. In 1880, Bishop Matthew Simpson of the M.E. Church described the seminary's early years thus \\"no other institution in the church accomplishing apparently more in the education of active and useful young men and young women.\\" The early years of the institution were said to be ones of \\"great prosperity.\\" This was especially true under the administrations of the Rev. Schuyler Seager. Seager was born 8 July 1807 in Simsbury, Connecticut. He joined the Genesee Conference in 1833. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1836. That same year he was appointed Teacher of Moral Science and Belles-Lettres in the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary. He was chosen as Principal of the seminary in 1837. After entering pastoral ministry in 1844, he returned to the seminary in 1854, again as Principal.In 1856-57 he was made Principal of the Genesee Model School in Lima, New York, an offshoot of the seminary. Joseph Cummings was appointed President of Genesee in 1854, a position he held until 1857.Joseph Cummings Papers, Box 1, Folder 1, \\"Biographical Materials. Northwestern University Archives, Evanston, Illinois In 1850 it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary. The Rev. Dr. Benjamin Franklin Tefft was elected President of this endeavor. The name was chosen as Genesee College. However, the location was thought by many not to be sufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. In 1866, after several hard years, the trustees of the struggling college decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. As Genesee College began looking for a new home, the bustling community of Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search of its own. The rail age had expanded the prosperity brought by the Erie Canal, and the city was booming, but its citizens yearned for something more: > \\"What gives to Oxford and Cambridge, England, to Edinburgh, Scotland, to New > Haven, Connecticut, their most illustrious names abroad?\\" asked one local > writer. \\"Their Universities,\\" he answered. \\"Syracuse has all the advantages: > business, social, and religious ‚Äì let her add the educational and she adds > to her reputation, her desirability.\\"W. Freeman Galpin, Syracuse University: > The Pioneer Years (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press,, 1952) After a year of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima and contending cities across the state, it was resolved to remove the college to Syracuse, New York. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875. At its founding on March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the university its charter independent of Genesee College. The university opened in September 1871. The college, its libraries, the students and faculty, and the college's two secret societies all relocated to Syracuse.

In 1900 he returned to Glasgow in order to study, coming back to Africa in 1901. On his return he was appointed secretary of a small mining company and subsequently joined the firm of Haddon, Cotton & Butt, a Rhodesian shipping and forwarding house. John Downie was very successful in his new position and rose to be managing director. He was interested in a number of gold mining ventures, and in addition to his firm acted as manager of the Portland Cement Works for some time. John Downie later sold his interests in the firm, and in 1920 he became manager of the Salisbury Farmer's Co- operative, holding this post till the period of the end of Chartered Company Rule in 1923. John Downie was a keen advocate of responsible government and served as treasurer of the Responsible Government Party. Subsequently he became Chairman of the Rhodesia Party and was responsible for much of the work of party organisation. On 29 April 1924, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as co-member, with Francis James Newton, for Mazoe under the system of double member constituencies then in existence. On 30 January 1925, he became Minister of Agriculture and Lands and in this capacity he played an important part in popularising Rhodesian tobacco in London, in encouraging the cotton industry and in promoting agricultural co-operative efforts. On 14 October 1927, he took over the portfolio for Mines and Public Works, but continued to take a considerable interest in agricultural affairs. John Downie was strongly critical of the management of the railways and several times clashed with the railway companies on that score. On the other hand, he was able to reach a satisfactory arrangement with the Chartered Company to solve the problems of simplifying the collection of mining revenue, and he took an important part in settling some of the differences between miners and farmers.

He was also a teacher of painting for twenty years at the Central School of Art and Design in London. == Early life == John Copnall was born in Slinfold, a village near Horsham in West Sussex. His father was the eminent sculptor Edward Bainbridge Copnall (1903‚Äì1970) whilst his mother Muriel was an enthusiastic amateur artist and his uncle and aunt, Frank and Teresa Copnall, were both professional artists of some standing. Another uncle, Hubert Copnall (1918‚Äì1997), was also an artist and sculptor, although he spent over thirty years farming, having been initially so required as a World War II conscientious objector.Independent Obituary of John Copnall by David Buckman October 2007 His paternal grandfather EW Copnall was an early photographer and artist. Copnall showed early promise in drawing and his strong draughtsman skills would be at the heart of his work throughout his painting life. At the age of eighteen he began studies at the Architectural Association in London. This proved a poor choice of a career as Copnall lacked the required mathematical ability and used the excuse of his National Service to leave the profession permanently in order to become a professional artist. == His Career in Spain == Initially Copnall started his painting studies under the tutelage of his father at the Sir John Cass School of Art in the City of London and from 1949 under the artist Sir Henry Rushbury at the Royal Academy School.Jerry Knight, All About Horsham Magazine, Article on Bainbridge Copnall, May 2013 His early work is largely figurative and he won the prestigious Turner Gold Medal for Landscape Painting in his final year in 1954. In 1954 Copnall and his friend Bert Flugelman visited Spain for what was intended to be a short visit. The effect was almost instant and he fell in love with the Iberian landscape staying for fourteen years. Whilst on Ibiza he married his first wife Madeleine Chardon with whom he had a daughter and when the marriage ended he moved to the mainland to live in a hacienda in the mountains above Malaga where he earned a living as a painter sometimes using the name of Juan de Retam√°. The intense light of Spain and the visceral nature of its people changed his art fundamentally as he experimented with intense earthy colours whilst increasingly moving towards abstraction. Throughout his career Copnall was interested in using intense colour and the Spanish light undoubtedly enhanced his artistic senses. As the 60's progressed Copnall became fashionable and he began to sell his paintings to private collectors that included Melvyn Douglas. He had several solo exhibitions in Spain and Catalonia as well as shows in Germany where he was also popular and a lesser one in England in Newcastle. He said of his life in the 1960s: \\"No Beatles, but plenty of bullfighting, flamenco and Rioja!\\" Guardian obituary by Simon Fenwick July 12th 2007 == Return To England == In 1968 John Copnall returned to England and the following year held a solo exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford. His work was clearly influenced by that of American abstract expressionists such as Barnett Newman, Morris Louis and Mark Rothko with Copnall using acrylic paint on cotton duck on increasingly larger canvasses. His use of colour was exuberant. Copnall stated that 'Painting is colour and colour is painting.\\" In 1970 he won the E A Abbey Scholarship and further recognition followed with Art Council awards in 1973 and a British Council Award in 1979. As the 60s progressed abstract art began to lose influence as new 'pop' style were in vogue and to some extent Copnall found himself less fashionable during the late 70s and 80s. A series of solo exhibitions were held throughout the 1970s but Copnall was becoming a peripheral figure in the context of mainstream English art. Nevertheless, his influence on the next generation of British artists is evident following a twenty-year period from 1973 to 1993 when Copnall worked as a teacher at the Canterbury School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design. He had married for the second time in 1976 to Caroline Brown with whom he had a son and a daughter and he required the financial stability that teaching provided. The marriage was dissolved in 1997. == Later years in London== He was by 1982 working in an artists' colony in the East End of London having bought the defunct Spratts Dog Food warehouse in Bow whilst continuing his teaching role. In 1996 his solo show \\"Reflections, Orbits and Radiances\\" in the sympathetic surroundings of the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex drew mainly on work done in the period 1992-96. In the catalogue, Christopher Lloyd, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, considered that it was \\"difficult to think of a more appropriate setting for John Copnall's paintings\\" than this light- filled example of pioneering mid-1930s architecture. Copnall was elected to the London Group in 1988. During the final years of his life Copnall painted infrequently and ceased all together following a stroke. He died on 9 June 2007 following a short illness. == References External links== *http://www.modernbritishartists.co.uk *http://www.artnet.com/artists/john- copnall/ *http://www.britishartists.co.uk/john_copnall/index.htm Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:21st-century English painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:British landscape painters Category:Abstract expressionist artists Category:1928 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Horsham District Category:People from Sussex Category:Academics of the Central School of Art and Design ","title":"John Copnall"},{"id":"19349690","text":"A practical engineer (Technical Engineer)() is a professional degree awarded by technological colleges in Israel and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the Ministry of Industry, Trade & Labor.Ministry of Industry, Trade & Labor (State of Israel) Retrieved on 15 September 2008 It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel. It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline. == Professional regulation == Practical Engineers mediate between professional engineers and engineering technicians. While most of the decision making process is performed by professional engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by professional engineers. In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the hi-tech industry and form an important work-force. Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level. For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high with 2 dimensional static scheme and spans up to 6 meters, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required. == Education, training and skills == Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training. In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years. From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics. Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused. As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an internship program. == Equivalent qualifications == There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero T√©cnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as Engineering technicians, Associate Engineers or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries. The French Brevet de Technicien Sup√©rieur is similar. Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a Bachelor's degree == References  External links == * Definition of Practical Engineer at ORT College's website. * School of Practical Engineering, Hadassah College Jerusalem. * School of Practical Engineering at the Technion-IIT (Israel Institute of Technology) City.

He was educated privately and at Upholland Grammar School where his father was the headmaster.The Times, 25 October 1924 In 1887 Berridge married Agnes Campion from Redhill. Mrs. Berridge suffered from heart problems in later life and while apparently in good health and spirits was taken ill suddenly at a dance in Kensington and died in a few minutes in February 1909.The Times, 22 February 1909 They had one son and one daughter. ==Solicitor== Berridge went into the law and was articled to Maskell Peace, solicitors of Wigan,Who was Who, OUP 2007 who were the solicitors to the Mining Association of Great Britain. In 1878 he was admitted as a solicitor. In 1882 he became a partner in the firm of Burn & Berridge, solicitors to the government of Newfoundland. He was a member and later Master of the Court of the City of London Solicitors' Company of which David Lloyd George was also a member.The Times, 4 November 1908 ==Political and public life== Like most middle-class men of his time, Berridge took an interest in public affairs. He was some time Chairman of the Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Board of Works for the St Giles District in LondonThe Times, 8 March 1893 and he wanted a full-time career in politics. In 1904, he was Honorary Secretary of a committee of leading Liberal organisations set up to honour the retirement of Sir William Harcourt and commissioned two portraits of Sir William painted one for the family and the other to hang in the National Liberal Club.The Times, 4 July 1904 Warwick & Leamington by-election, 1903 In the summer of 1902 there were rumours of a possible vacancy in the constituency of Warwick and Leamington when the sitting Liberal Unionist member Alfred Lyttelton was tipped for an appointment to be a Judge or Governor of a British Colony. In the event this did not happen but it provided the opportunity for Berridge to associate himself with the constituency. In 1903 however Lyttelton was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Parliamentary regulations of the day required him to contest a by-election. Berridge was adopted as Liberal candidate.The Times, 9 July 1913 There was some initial suggestion that Lyttelton should not be opposed but the local Liberal Association decided there were good precedents for such a contest and wished to have the chance of opposing the government on its policies. Besides, Alfred Lyttelton was to succeed Joseph Chamberlain as Colonial Secretary and the Warwick & Leamington seat being so close to Chamberlain's Birmingham stronghold it was considered by the Liberals as something of a \\"rotten borough\\" which Chamberlain felt he could dispose of as he wished, and this was added reason for the Liberals' wish to stand a candidate. The by-election resulted in a Unionist majority of 190 for Lyttelton over Berridge on a turnout of 86%. This contrasted to Lyttelton's majority of 831 at the previous general election in 1900. General Election of 1906 Berridge remained the local Liberal candidate after the by-election and when the new Liberal prime minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman announced the dissolution of Parliament on 16 December 1905 and called a general election for January 1906, Warwick and Leamington Liberal Association was quick to adopt Berridge formally as Liberal and free-trade candidate at a meeting on 18 December.The Times, 19 December 2005 On 12 January 1906, Lloyd George came to a public meeting in Leamington to speak for Berridge but due to a large number of Unionist supporters (many imported from Birmingham) causing disruption and noise and singing patriotic songs in the hall, he was never able to make himself heard and had to leave and make his speech to a smaller gathering of Liberals at another location.Irish Times, 12 January 1906 Benefitting from the surge in support for the Liberal Party at the general election, Berridge won Warwick and Leamington with a majority of 209 votes, removing Lyttelton from the House of Commons,The Times, 17 January 1906 at least for a few weeks until he was returned unopposed at a by-election for the seat of St George's, Hanover Square in Westminster. Berridge remained MP for Warwick and Leamington for four years until the general election of January 1910 when he was defeated by the Conservative Ernest Pollock. In March 1910 Berridge gave his constituency party notice that he was unlikely to contest the next election after his defeatThe Times, 25 October 1910 but he did in fact agree to stand at the December 1910 general election although he again lost to Pollock.The Times, 6 December 1910 ==Honours== Berridge was knighted in 1912 and made a KBE in 1920 for his war work, in particular for his chairmanship of the executive committee of the Royal Flying Corps later the Royal Air Force Voluntary Hospitals between 1916‚Äì1919. ==Death== Berridge died in a nursing home at Sandgate, Kent at the age of 67 on 24 October 1924. ==References * Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1906‚Äì1910 Category:1857 births Category:1924 deaths Category:People educated at Upholland Grammar School ","title":"Thomas Berridge"},{"id":"19349700","text":"View of St Andrew's Church, Waterloo Street, Hove from above. St Andrew's Church is a former Anglican church in the Brunswick Town area of Hove, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, the national charity protecting historic churches at risk. Although declared redundant in 1990, it was one of the area's most fashionable places of worship in the 19th century, when it was built to serve the wealthy residents of the Brunswick estate and surrounding areas. It is listed at Grade I, a designation used for buildings \\"of outstanding architectural or historic interest\\". ==History== The area between Brighton, to the east, and the ancient centre of Hove, to the west, was farmland until the 1820s, when Brunswick Town was developed in response to the success of the Kemp Town estate in Brighton‚Äîa planned estate of high-class houses, servants' quarters and other buildings, all in the Regency style. Architect Charles Busby planned and built the Brunswick Town estate, which (together with other nearby residential development) helped the population of Hove to rise from 100 in 1801 to 2,500 in 1841. The only church nearby was St Andrew's, the ancient parish church; this was some distance away and had fallen into near-dereliction. The curate of the (now demolished) St Margaret's Church in Cannon Place, Brighton, Rev. Edward Everard, owned some land near the former Wick Farm, on which the Brunswick Town estate had been built. He was aware that there was no plan to build a church in the estate, so he decided to build a proprietary chapel on his land. Rev. Everard knew Charles Busby, but they had fallen out after a disagreement in 1824 over the commission for the Sussex County Hospital (now the Royal Sussex County Hospital) in Brighton: Everard was overruled by other members of the planning committee and had to break his promise that Busby would be allowed to design it. Therefore, Everard looked for a different architect to design and build the church, and Charles Barry‚Äîwho had already built the hospital and St Peter's Church in Brighton‚Äîwas chosen. The church has a blue plaque commemorating Barry. Construction started in April 1827. Everard was granted an Act of Parliament on 3 April 1828 giving him and his successors ownership of the church, the right to appoint a curate for the next 40 years, and two-thirds of income from pew rents and other sources. Everard himself acted as the first curate, from the church's consecration on 5 July 1828 until 1838, one year before his death. St Andrew's immediately became popular with the fashionable set, helped by the regular presence of members of the Royal Family and the aristocracy. Among the many Dukes and Duchesses to worship there in the mid-19th century was the elderly Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, who often made loud and sometimes eccentric comments and remarks during services. Between 300 and 350 people regularly worshipped at the church in 1851 according to a census taken during that year; there were 420 pews, 340 of which were subject to pew rents. The interior was reordered in 1869, with new open benches installed in place of individual seats. A more radical change took place in 1882, when the church was extended at a cost of ¬£7,000 (¬£2,000 to buy and demolish an adjacent stable block and ¬£5,000 for the construction work); Charles Barry's son Edward Middleton Barry added a chancel, a sanctuary with Ionic columns, an illuminated dome and space for an organ. Although the organ is no longer in place, its case has been retained. A pulpit had been donated in 1918, and more additions were made in the 1920s, including enlargements to the altar case, a pedimented baldacchino above the altar, a marble font with its own baldacchino, new stained glass windows and new, clearer Venetian glass surrounding these. The changes cost ¬£4,000. The stated intention was to brighten the interior of the church and \\"create a little piece of Italy\\" within the Italianate building. The church remained in use until the late 20th century, but was declared redundant on 14 February 1990 because of declining attendance at services. The decline had set in several decades earlier, and the Diocese were considering demolition; the granting of Grade I-listed status on 24 March 1950 meant this could not happen. The Churches Conservation Trust now owns and maintains the building. Squatters caused damage during the 1990s, but restoration work in 2001 and 2002, costing more than ¬£100,000, allowed the building to be reopened for occasional services, special events and community activities. The church was always unparished, having been built as a chapel of ease to St Andrew's in Church Road. Starting September 22, 2013 the Church has been used monthly as the venue for the Brighton and Hove Chapter of The Sunday Assembly.http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10584033.Atheists_set_up_Brighton_and_Hove_s_first_godless_church_in_Waterloo_Street/ ==Architecture== The exterior, facing west, is the first example in England of the Italianate style being used on a church. Originally, the interior was less grand, with no chancel, simple pulpits and a single gallery, making it a plain, box-like preaching-house. The building materials used for the exterior are brick and ashlar. The entrance door is set beneath a round-headed arched opening between twin pilasters, the outer pair of which serve as quoins for the adjacent recessed walls. There is a small domed bell tower with a lead roof and clock faces, containing a bell cast in 1930 as a replacement for an early 19th-century predecessor (this bore an inscription dated 1811). In its present form, the interior consists of a gallery at the west end, nave, transepts on two sides, a chancel, a side chapel in the southeast corner and a vestry in the northeast, with Italianate top-lighting and domes. The narthex, from where a stone staircase leads up to the gallery, is also top-lit, and now contains most of the church's memorial stones; these were moved there from the body of the church after it was declared redundant. Five, including memorials commemorating Lord Charles Somerset and Sir George Dallas, 1st Baronet, remain in the nave, however. St Andrew's is the only church in Hove to have burial vaults beneath it. Space for burials was restricted in the Brunswick Town area by the time the church was built, because of the rapid residential development, and the churchyard at St Andrew's on Church Road was difficult to get to. Lord Charles Somerset, an M.P. who later became Governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa, was the first person to be buried in the vault, in 1831. A court order in 1854 prevented any more burials being made, and the vaults were used as air-raid shelters during World War II. ==See also== *Grade I listed buildings in Brighton and Hove *List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in Southeast England *List of places of worship in Brighton and Hove ==NotesBibliography== * * * Category:Church of England church buildings in Brighton and Hove Hove, St Andrew Category:Churches completed in 1827 Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Grade I listed buildings in Brighton and Hove Hove, St Andrew Category:Former churches in Brighton and Hove Category:Former Church of England church buildings Category:1827 establishments in England ","title":"St Andrew's Church, Waterloo Street, Hove"},{"id":"19349715","text":"Kewl may refer to: *Cool (disambiguation) *KEWL *Kewl Chix *Kewl Magazine ","title":"Kewl"},{"id":"19349716","text":"The name Lawin has been used in the Philippines by PAGASA in the Western Pacific. *Typhoon Megi (2004) (T0415, 18W, Lawin) ‚Äì struck Japan. *Tropical Depression Lawin (2008) (14W) ‚Äì a tropical depression that was only recognized by PAGASA and the JTWC. * Typhoon Jelawat (2012) (T1217, 18W, Lawin) ‚Äì struck Japan. * Typhoon Haima (2016) (T1622, 25W, Lawin) - struck Northern Luzon.

He was the captain of the club, which he has led to two China Super League titles in 2006 and 2008. ==Club career== Shu started his career in 1996 with Shandong Luneng where in his first season he would make 3 league appearances, which was then followed by a further 7 the following season. Under the Shandong Luneng Head coach Yin Tiesheng he would gradually establish himself as reliable central defender within the team, however it was the introduction of Slobodan Santraƒç as the team's new Head coach that saw Shu become a prominent member with the club that would win the league and cup double in the 1999 league season. Even after Santraƒç left Shu had firmly established himself as one of their most consistent players and would go on to become the club's captain that oversaw them through some of their most successful periods in their history by winning several further league and cup trophies. After over a decade of consistency Shu would spend much of the 2009 league season on the bench due to injury. When he returned near the end of the season Liu Jindong would become the team captain and when the 2010 league started he was given a reserved position within the team with Liu remaining as captain. ==International career== Shu was given his chance to impress the Chinese Head coach Bora Milutinoviƒá in a friendly against Hong Kong on April 25, 2000 in a 1-0 victory.

The name derives from the way that two spoons may be positioned side by side, with bowls aligned.Cox, Tracey. The Hot Sex Handbook (Random House, Inc., 2005), p. 64. The sexual spoons position is a form of a rear-entry position, the other being the doggy style position. The spoons sex position has been called one of the \\"basic four\\" sex positions.Tim F. LaHaye, Beverly LaHaye, Mike Yorkey. The Act of Marriage After 40: Making Love for Life (Zondervan, 2000), pp. 92-93. ==Practice== In the spoons cuddling position, one partner lies on one side with knees bent while the other partner lies with his or her front pressed against their back. The spoons cuddling position is not limited to two people. In the sex position, the receiving partner would be in the inner spoon position and the penetrator is in the outer spoon in preparation for rear-entry penetration. For penetration, the partners may separate their upper bodies, with just the pelvises connecting, and their legs can also rest on top of each other.Castleman, Michael. Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex (Rodale, 2004), p. 143. The receiving partner may lift the upper knee to allow for easier penetration.Locker, Sari. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Amazing Sex (Penguin, 2005), pp. 194-195. During heterosexual sexual activity, the penetrating partner can caress the woman's stomach and stimulate her breasts, the back of the neck and ears, and clitoris. The woman can stimulate her own clitoris or her partner's scrotum.Sallie Foley, Sally A. Kope, Dennis P. Sugrue. Sex Matters for Women: A Complete Guide to Taking Care of Your Sexual Self (Guilford Press, 2001), pp. 238-239. In addition, the penis stimulates the front of the vagina, and may stimulate an area that is commonly termed the G-spot.Rosenau, Douglas E. A Celebration of Sex (Thomas Nelson Inc, 2002), p. 147. Along with the doggy style position, this may be the best position from which to stimulate this area.Stefan Bechtel, Larry Stains, Laurence Roy Stains. Sex: A Man's Guide (Rodale, 1996), p. 100.Keesling, Barbara. Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal and Intimacy (Hunter House, 2005), p. 101. Variations on this position include the partners lying on their sides face-to-face or in the scissors position.Kalish, Nancy. The Nice Girl's Guide to Sensational Sex (iUniverse, 2003), p. 182. Anal sex is also possible in this position, along with use of a vibrator.Taormino, Tristan. Down and Dirty Sex Secrets: The New and Naughty Guide to Being Great in Bed (HarperCollins, 2003), p. 143. ==Advantages and disadvantages== The spoons position allows for a great deal of physical intimacy, as there is full-body contact which allows for cuddling.Julia Heiman, Joseph Lopiccolo, David Palladini. Becoming Orgasmic: A Sexual and Personal Growth Program for Women (Simon and Schuster, 1987), p. 203. Both partners have control of the angle and depth of penetration, and slow, low- intensity sex can last for a long time because it usually takes longer for the man to reach orgasm.Salinger, Eve. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pleasing Your Man (Penguin, 2005). However, there is little visual stimulation for either partner, as they are not facing one another and cannot see each other's bodies fully. The penis can also slip out easily. The spoons position may be preferred by couples who have just woken up or are very tired. It may be used if the woman is pregnant, even during the last trimester, because it does not put any pressure on the abdomen. It is also good for those recovering from illness or surgery, or the elderly, because it puts less strain on muscles. ==History== Most Roman erotic art depicted couples in the spoons position.Younger, John Grimes.

It operated passenger service from 1910 until 1971. ==History== The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had operated rail lines along the lakeshore of Toronto since 1850. The lines encountered a steep hill into the Parkdale area of Toronto, from the west. In the first decade of the 1900s, the GTR operated the South Parkdale railway station at the intersection of Jameson Avenue and Springhurst Avenue. In 1910, the GTR embarked on a project to create a cut through the Parkdale neighbourhood, eliminating the grade. The railway decided to close the South Parkdale station and build a new one at the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue, in the area commonly known as 'Sunnyside'. The company built a temporary station, opening service in 1910. A permanent station was completed in 1912. It was situated at street level at the King and Queen Streets intersection. The ticket office and waiting area was at street level, and passengers would walk down staircases to track level. A separate bridge would pass over the tracks for passengers travelling east-bound. The grade elimination project also removed a level crossing of Queen Street to the Lakeshore Road. The following year a roadway bridge was built over the tracks immediately to the west of the station to connect the Sunnyside intersection with Lakeshore Road. The bridge was eventually demolished in the 1950s to build the Gardiner Expressway project. The location was well-situated, with access to the popular Sunnyside Amusement Park located nearby and streetcar routes nearby. A coach station, the Sunnyside Bus Terminal, was built across the street in 1936, providing access to motor coaches of the Gray Coach bus lines. The Edgewater Hotel was built next to the bus station on the north-west corner of the intersection in 1939. The rail lines and service was amalgamated into Canadian National Railways around 1920. GO Transit began service in May 1967 and took over CN's Toronto to Hamilton route. While CN's Hamilton train had stopped at Sunnyside, GO's Lakeshore West line bypassed the station resulting in a significant drop in its use. CN closed the station in 1971 and its buildings were demolished in 1973. ==Legacy== The site of the former station is now Beaty Boulevard Parkette, a small city park. ==Gallery== Image:SunnysideStation Temporary.jpgTemporary station in 1911.

The intent was to redevelop an area that had been home to light industrial activity and heavy pollution into a green space with walkways, picnic tables and an exercise course. The heavily polluted Pistol Creek was a key factor in the determination by the City to redevelop the area. The Bicentennial Park was built utilizing local funds and Federal Community Development Block Grant funds. Bicentennial Park was dedicated on July 4, 1976. The development of Bicentennial Park changed the complexion and character of the entire area. The initial walkways became the nexus of the Maryville Alcoa Greenway and the park itself became known locally as the Greenbelt. Between the period 1976 and 2007, the area surrounding Bicentennial Park began to grow and rejuvenate, with residential, commercial and public service development occurring at a slow but steady pace. Not long after completion, Canada geese stopped at Bicentennial Park on migration, and a small flock has remained at Bicentennial Park since that time. In 1996, the City Maryville celebrated its 200th Anniversary with the dedication of two monuments in the Bicentennial Park (Greenbelt). In 1999, the first phase of the Maryville Alcoa Greenway was completed which included all of the former walkways in Bicentennial Park. In 2002, the Blount County Library was opened, bordering Bicentennial Park.

The National Alliance for Hispanic Health is science-based and community-driven. The National Alliance for Hispanic Health is a paid subscriber to the \\"Best in America\\" seal from Independent Charities of America. Funds are not accepted from tobacco or alcohol companies. The National Alliance for Hispanic Health conducts Signature and Demonstration programs. Signature Programs include (1) Annual STEM Scholarships: Awarded 10 high school students. (2) Health Help Hotline connects consumers to health information and services; and, (3) Hispanic Family healthy lifestyle events in 10 cities. Demonstration Programs include promoting enrollment in Medicaid, Affordable Care Act, CHIP, other social welfare programs, and by promoting models for the financial sustainability of local health and human service providers, diabetes prevention, smoking cessation, cancer prevention, and Alzheimer's awareness. Additionally, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health participates in selected policy promotion as evidenced by collaboration on issues ranging from biosimilars to sugar sweetened beverages to clinical trials. The National Alliance for Hispanic Health provides information through its member organizations, which include national health organizations, community-based groups, universities, hospitals government agencies, foundations, and corporations. According to PBS, in 2006 it became the oldest network of Hispanic health and human services providers. The National Alliance for Hispanic Health is governed by a board of directors and managed by its president and chief executive officer, Dr. Jane L. Delgado, who has held that same post continually for over 32 years, since 1985. ==History== The National Alliance for Hispanic Health, was founded in 1973 as the Coalition of Spanish Speaking Mental Health Organizations (COSSMHO) and has also been known as the National Coalition for Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations. In 1987, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health was at the forefront of working with the federal government to improve its health data research for Hispanic populations in the United States. The initiative was prompted in part by publication of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' report on \\"Black and Minority Health\\" which had found more complete health and demographic data on American Indians and Asian Americans than Hispanics. The organization's research work has included the Hispanic Health Research Consortium whose work on the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) was published as the first collected mainstream health journal issue to focus on Hispanic health, research on Hispanic youth demographics which reported that Hispanics for the first time were the nation‚Äôs largest racial/ethnic group of children, and publication of findings from the first survey of Hispanic communities and emergency preparedness issues. Among its policy efforts, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health played a role in the landmark Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990, has been active in protection of patient rights under Executive Order 13166 to improve health access for limited English proficient (LEP) persons, lead health information technology policy efforts, has been active in regulatory oversight of the Medicare Modernization Act, is an advocate for expansion of the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, is a vocal advocate on tobacco control policy in Hispanic communities, and advocates for clean air and water in Hispanic communities. In 2007, NAHH partnered with Research!America to field the first national public opinion survey of Hispanics on health and research issues. Most recently, as a compliment to its online action network, the organization established the Vote for Your Health effort that delivers election day text message reminders to vote to members. The 1998 Surgeon General Report on Tobacco Use recognized the Alliance for having \\"refused the support of the tobacco industry\\" and alcohol industry and \\"adopted a formal policy not to accept money from tobacco companies or their subsidiaries.\\" ==Programs== NAHH serves Hispanic communities nationwide through its member health providers and organizations. Its areas of health information services have included obesity, diabetes, heart health, high blood pressure, mental health, fitness, physical activity, healthy eating, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, environmental health and health insurance, among many others. The National Alliance for Hispanic Health operates the sister organization, Healthy Americas Foundation, for its programs. In 2012 NAHH partnered with USC and created the sister organization, Healthy Americas Institute, at the Keck School of Medicine. ==See also== * Dr. Jane L.

Its borders are roughly Downtown and Harrison Street to the west, the East Lake Neighborhood and Lakeshore Avenue to the east, the Lakeside Apartments District and 14th Street to the North, and Chinatown and 11th Street to the South. ==History== Since the era of Mayor Francis Mott and later under Mayor John Davie's administration from 1915‚Äì1931, various redevelopment plans have been proposed for the district. Davie was fond of the lake, and took to rowing there daily for recreation. Davie attempted to fulfill his original dream of a \\"Civic Center\\" at the south end of Lake Merritt. Dredging material was used to fill, and make usable for the project, nearly a of swampy land from 1st to 7th Streets and from Fallon Street to 5th Avenue. A new museum building was planned, along with an athletic center, an exhibition hall, an opera house, a symphony hall and other facilities. Before the end of WWII, Oakland's City Manager at the time, Charles R. Schwanenberger, began raising hopes for renewed development in the district. Revised plans called for a new main public library, a central fire station, police administration building, and a new jail in the area. The long-delayed widening of the 12th Street dam, at the time a traffic bottleneck for motorists, destroyed the Gardens of the Oakland Auditorium, and dashed hopes for a Civic Center at that site. Following the war, a planning document for \\"Civic Center and Lake Merritt Improvement\\" was adopted as a part of the city's Master Plan. This plan called for more than a dozen public buildings to be grouped between Harrison and Fallon and between 14th and 10th Streets in a rectangle, continuing past the Oakland Auditorium and the School Administration Building on East 10th Street in a curve around the south end of Lake Merritt. A moratorium on new construction was imposed on the entire area pending development of the Civic Center, much to the chagrin of property owners. Today parts of the plan have been realized on solid land on the west side of the lake, to include government office buildings, a courthouse, post office library, community college campus, and museum grounds. ==Residences== The district features the historic Hotel Oakland, now a senior residence, at its west end, and the 1920s Peralta Apartments on Jackson Street. The district also features 2‚Äì4 story mixed-use buildings at its southwest corner with apartments above ground-floor retail spaces. ==Public buildings== The district is heavily sprinkled with government buildings to include Oakland's historic Civic Center Post Office on the city block bounded by Alice, Jackson, 13th and 12th Streets, the federal Social Security Administration Building on Jackson Street, two Alameda County government office buildings, the Alameda County Law Library, Oakland's Main Library on 14th Street, The Alameda County Courthouse on Lake Merritt, Oakland's historic Fire Alarm Building on Oak Street, the Oakland Museum on 12th Street, and the Kaiser Convention Center anchoring the east end of the neighborhood near the 12th Street Dam. A new use for the Kaiser Convention Center was proposed in 2006: a redevelopment designed to nucleate a cultural and educational district with the neighboring Oakland Museum of California and Laney College.Library Bond Measure Headed for the November 7 Ballot: Oakland Public Library Press Release, August 1, 2006 In July 2006, the Oakland City Council approved a bond measure to expand the city's library system and convert the closed Center into a replacement for the city's aging main library, but Oakland voters defeated the library bond measure in the November 2006 election.Defeat of Bond Measure Forces Library System to Rethink Improvements: Nance, Mariama - North Gate News Online, November 15, 2006 =='Infill' parcels== The district is also heavily sprinkled with 'infill' parcels which have a variety of daily commercial use. Most are used as parking for the districts drive-in workforce, and nighttime bar and nightclub patrons. One is used as a preschool playground. One parcel at the Southeast corner of 12th and Jackson, which was formerly the site of a retail building, has been leveled, and the dirt lot is being reclaimed by nature as a Greenfield. ==Land development activity== In recent years, mid-rise, mixed-use condominium buildings have been planned and constructed on the edges of the district. Several high-rise mixed-use projects ranging from 10-40 stories in height, have been proposed by a variety of developers. Some are still active in various stages of the planning process. 2001 Civic Center Cathedral proposal In 2001, the Oakland Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church proposed a replacement for the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral, which was damaged in the 1989 earthquake and subsequently demolished. The diocese hired a Swiss architect who designed a grand cathedral featuring curving steel beams coming to a point some fifteen stories high. The diocese proposed situating the cathedral directly in front of the Kaiser Convention Center and surrounding it with a \\"grand plaza.\\" The plaza would have been elevated, so that both the parking lot and adjacent roads would still have been usable, and it would have extended all the way to the edge of the lake. Coalition of Advocates for Lake Merritt (CALM), an Oakland group proposed an alternative plan involving a remake of the 12th Street Dam halving the number of traffic lanes from six to three in each direction. The underpasses and overpasses were proposed to be eliminated, with stoplights installed where the road intersects with 12th Street and 1st Avenue. The beach was proposed to be widened, with a gently sloping lawn leading up to the roadway, new walking and bike paths in each direction. Crosswalks with pedestrian-activated stoplights were proposed to replace the tunnels under the freeway. ==See also== *Chinatown *Jack London Square *Lakeside Apartments District *Oakland City Center *Oaksterdam *Uptown Oakland ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Oakland, California Oakland ","title":"Civic Center, Oakland, California"},{"id":"19350143","text":"A captive unit is a business unit of a company functioning offshore as an entity of its own while retaining the work and close operational tie ups within the parent company.

They differed chiefly in engine power. Only one of each was constructed. The 14's type number was reused for an unrelated parasol wing prototype that was basis of the more successful Lat√©co√®re 17. ==Development and design== The types 14 and 16 were designed to transport a mixture of passengers and post, partly in response to the experiences of Lignes Aeriennes Lat√©co√®re with the recently introduced Breguet 14T, a transport version of a World War I reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Two examples, very similar apart from their engines, were flown in October 1923 and were sufficiently interesting to be purchased by the government the following month. Each was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing root thickness/chord ratio of 27%, thinning to 12% outboard. In plan the half-wings were trapezoidal with only slight leading edge sweep and angled tips. Ailerons occupied the outer halves of the trailing edge. Structurally they were of mixed construction, built around twin wood and metal spars and fabric covered. The Lat√©co√®re 14 was powered by a Renault 12Fe water-cooled V12 engine in the nose with its rectangular radiator in front of a flat-sided cowling. An oblique exhaust pipe protruded from its upper surface. The more powerful Lat√©co√®re 16 had a Lorraine 12D, another water-cooled V12. Its radiator was mounted below the nose on the forward undercarriage legs. Behind the different engines of the two models, the basic fuselage was the same duralumin tube structure for each, the surface defined with wooden stringers. The forward part was dural covered and the rest with fabric. The pilot's open cockpit was high up over the wing leading edge and passengers were seated in a cabin below the wing. That of the type 14 was basic and provided three seats; in the more powerful type 16 it was divided into two with a transverse partition, each compartment accommodating two passengers more comfortably and lit by two windows, one sliding for ventilation, on each side. Each was entered by its own port-side door. The metal-framed, canvas covered empenage was conventional, with a clipped-triangular tailplane bearing straight-edged, balanced elevators with angled tips. The two models had somewhat different fins, the 14's short and trapezoidal, the 16's taller and almost triangular, mounting a tall, broad, unbalanced rudder which reached down to the keel and worked in an elevator cut-out. The undercarriage was conventional and fixed, with a track of . The mainwheeels were on a single faired axle provided with shock absorbers and supported at each end with W-struts from the lower fuselage. There was a tailskid at the rear. Flight testing, with Enderlin at the controls, began in October 1923. ==Operational history== Lignes A√©riennes Lat√©co√®re tested the Lat√©co√®re 14 against the Breguet 14T, which had the same Renault engine. The Breguet was faster but carried only half the payload. The more powerful Lat√©co√®re 16 looked rather more promising. It flew to Paris in December 1924 and was displayed at the annual Salon, but little more was heard of it. Instead, Lat√©co√®re concentrated on a second design, also referred to as the Lat√©co√®re 14, which was a smaller aircraft with a thinner section parasol wing. It became the prototype of the better-selling Lat√©co√®re 17. ==Variants== ;Lat√©co√®re 14: Renault 12Fe. Three passengers. Trapezoidal vertical tail. ;Lat√©co√®re 16: Lorraine 12D. Four passengers.

It is served by trains of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and metros of the GVB. The station opened on 1 June 1986. It is located on the Amsterdam- Schiphol railway, a few km south of Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station. South of this station, trains turn west towards Schiphol railway station, while metros turn east towards Amsterdam Zuid railway station. The station is located in the Amsterdam borough of Slotervaart, on a long viaduct spanning three roads. ==History== Construction The station was built in 1986 when a link was constructed from Amsterdam Centraal to Schiphol Airport. The new line reduced journey time from Centraal Station and Schiphol to as little as 16 minutes. The other stations built on this line were Amsterdam Sloterdijk (rebuilt) and Amsterdam De Vlugtlaan. De Vlugtlaan was closed in May 2000 to enable construction of the Hemboog, which enabled direct connections to Zaandam and beyond since 2003. Nederlandse Spoorwegen For its first 10 years, Intercity trains called at Lelylaan station, providing direct services to places as far away as Brussels, Berlin and Leeuwarden. From 1996 to 2006, only stopping trains called at this station. In 2006 an intercity service Schiphol-Amsterdam Centraal-Lelystad was introduced, which also calls at Lelylaan. Since December 2016, only stopping trains call at the station once again. GVB The metro platform is an island platform, which has a direct link onto GVB tram lines 1 and 17. The main entrance is further south. In the early 2000s the stairs to the tram lines were closed off with fences to counter fare evasion, which was running high, with people running off the train and straight onto a tram. Early 2007 the gates were opened again, but only during daytime. Until 1988 the only tram here had been the 1, but in that year the 17 was extended from Surinameplein to Osdorp. The two lines follow different routes into the city centre. In 1997 GVB opened its fourth metro line, the 50 (Isolatorweg - Gein). The station is also served by a bus station. ==Train services== , the following train services call at this station: *Local Sprinter services Leiden - Hoofddorp - Schiphol - Zaandam - Hoorn Kersenboogerd *Local Sprinter services The Hague - Leiden - Schiphol - Amsterdam - Weesp - Almere - Lelystad - Zwolle *Local Sprinter services Hoofddorp - Schiphol - Amsterdam - Hilversum - Amersfoort Vathorst ==Tram services== The current tram situation has its origin in December 2001. The first tram in this area was in 1954, when line 1 ran to Slotermeer. It was extended in 1962. In 1988 line 17 was extended to Osdorp as well, after it used to terminate at Surinameplein 1 km east of Lelylaan. Line 1 terminated at Dijkgraafplein and line 17 terminated at the Osdorpplein, near Meer en Vaart. In 2001 the current service pattern came into operation. { class=\\" vatop\\" ! Tram Service !

From 1970, she participated in courses at a number of unaccredited institutions, offering courses in the \\"human energy field\\". She completed a two‚Äìyear program in Therapeutic Counselling at the Community of the Whole Person in Washington, D.C., followed by a three-year program in Core Energetics at the Institute for Core Energetics in New York City in 1978 and a five-year program in Spiritual Healership at the Phoenicia Pathwork Center in Phoenicia, New York in 1979. She was strongly influenced by Eva and John Pierrakos, who founded a system for self-transformation called the Pathwork, drawing on the ideas of Wilhelm Reich and Alexander Lowen. Brennan worked with the Pierrakos, and became a Pathwork Helper and Core Energetics therapist.Brennan, Barbara (1987). Hands of Light, Bantam Press at Random House, New York City. Brennan also took seminars with and was influenced by Rev. Rosalyn L. Bruyere. She developed her own private healing practice in 1977 and then established a training programme to teach others.Goldner, Diane (2003). How People Heal, Hampton Roads, Newburyport. Brennan has a PhD in philosophy from Greenwich University in Australia and DTh in theology from Holos University, both earned in 2001. These universities are unaccredited.List of unaccredited degree suppliers maintained by Oregon Office of Degree Authorization == Ideas and theories == Her first book, Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field, is considered a \\"classic\\"Boston Public Library in the field of spiritual healing, with reputedly over one million copies in print in 22 languages. Brennan claims to receive intuitive information about her clients during sessions, and to see repetitive patterns in the energy fields of her clients indicating common roots underlying their difficulties. Brennan's books contain drawings of auras and energy fields, and descriptions of how human energy fields interact with each other. She has popularized a seven-layer model of the energy field, each layer being structured of differing frequencies and kinds of energy and performing different functions. Brennan views the chakras as transformers that receive and process universal energy, as well as enabling expression and healthy functioning of the individual's own consciousness and psycho-physical make-up. She is best known for taking a methodical approach to energy healing. Brennan has created a type of energy healing techniques that she calls \\"full spectrum healing\\" to work on the seven layers of the human energy field or auras. Brennan claims that the technique she calls spiritual surgery works on the fifth level of the human energy field using the power of a spirit surgeon.  Brennan's concept of \\"hara\\"  In her second book, Light Emerging, Brennan added, to her model of human subtle energies, the dimension of \\"intentionality\\" called \\"hara\\". Hara holds the human body in material manifestation until the life purpose is fulfilled. When the hara is healthy, the individual acts naturally and effortlessly to fulfill his or her life purpose. The hara is the foundation for the human energy field (HEF), or aura. Because of this relationship, healing hara is considered especially powerful for healing the auric field and, thereby, the physical body. She also talks about the corestar.

The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the SWPA, General Douglas MacArthur. Dexterity included amphibious landings at Arawe on 15 December 1943, and Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943 in the northwest of New Britain, the capture of the Imperial Japanese held Tuluvu aerodrome on the 30 December 1943 and the amphibious landing at Saidor on 2 January 1944. The operation ended on 10 February 1944. ==History and planning== The Empire of Japan had largely achieved its objectives in the Pacific region in the spring of 1942, with almost the entire area between Burma and the Bismarck Archipelago under Japanese control. Further Japanese offensives against the Allied lines were planned to force them into a single decisive battle and then request negotiations for their surrender. The initial Japanese offensive failed during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and subsequently the Japanese attempt to also capture Port Moresby in New Guinea collapsed, ending the Japanese offensive run in the Pacific theater of operations for the rest of the war. The allies in the South Pacific began their first counter-offensive against the Japanese-held island Guadalcanal in August 1942 and the Japanese forces were forced onto the defensive. To keep the Japanese cowed and begin the Allied advance towards the Japanese home islands, the Allied military leadership envisaged an advance through the Pacific over two main lines of attack. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz would lead Allied forces in the Pacific and General Douglas MacArthur would advance Allied operations against the Japanese in the Southwest Pacific. Landings along the coast of New Guinea were planned which constituted the first step towards a return to the Philippines and the conquest of the Gilbert Islands. The operation in New Guinea was known as Operation Cartwheel which began on 30 June 1943 with the objective to conquer New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and Rabaul. Until mid-September 1943, the fighting focused on the eastern part of New Guinea, while a decision was made on 22 September 1943 to land in West New Britain. Operation Dexterity was to be conducted in three separate phases: *Operation Lazaretto ‚Äì Planned landing in southern New Britain at the plantation of Lindenhafen, approximately 5 km from Gasmata on 14 November 1943 and the neutralization of Japanese base at Gasmata for protection of eastern flank for the subsequent operation. This operation was never undertaken and replaced by Operation Director. ::Units: 126th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) and elements of the 32nd Infantry Division and the Sixth Army. *Operation Director ‚Äì Landing in southwestern New Britain at Arawe as a diversion for Operation Backhander, Arawe was planned as patrol boat base. ::Units: 112th Regimental Combat Team *Operation Backhander ‚Äì Landing in northwestern New Britain at Cape Gloucester to capture local Japanese airfields and convert them into a major Allied airbase. ::Units: 1st Marine Division. *Operation Michaelmas ‚Äì Landing in New Guinea at Saidor to prevent the withdrawal of Japanese troops retreating in the advance of the Australian Army from Finschhafen. ::Units: 32nd Infantry Division ==Geography and Environment== An American M4 Sherman advances through rainforest during Operation Dexterity Like most of the islands of the South Pacific, the Islands of the Bismarck Archipelago are of volcanic origin with steep mountain slopes, jungle and treacherous marshes, where malaria was a problem for all deployed troops. The hot, tropical climate was rarely ameliorated by the torrential rain storms and dense clouds which afflicted the region. The inhabited islands had been managed by Australia as a League of Nations Mandate before the war, and there was only a settlement of Westerners originally settled by Imperial Germany before the First World War that was centered on coconut plantations and missionary complexes. ==The Japanese on New Britain== General Hitoshi Imamura, Commander of 8th Area Army in Rabaul The high command of the 8th Area Army of the Japanese Imperial Army in Rabaul controlled the Japanese actions in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands. In January 1942, the Japanese had taken the strategically important port of Rabaul in northeastern New Britain and in subsequent months the largest and most important Japanese naval and air base in the Pacific was constructed at that location. The 8th Area Army was commanded by General Hitoshi Imamura who had at his disposal nearly 200,000 men. In early 1943, the Japanese leadership had expected that the Allies would attempt to break the inner Japanese defensive belt in the Pacific and attack the bases on New Guinea, the Mariana Islands, Palau and the Philippines. General Imamura therefore foresaw an attack on New Britain, at the latest after the Allies had occupied New Ireland, which was expected in February or March 1944. The 8th Area Army relied exclusively on barge and submarine traffic from Rabaul to New Guinea, because of Allied air superiority. In September 1943, Major General Iwao Matsuda took over the 65th Brigade, the various pioneers and debarkation units, and a number of troops of the 51st Division, whose main units were on New Guinea in the fight against Australian troops. Two companies of 115th Division and provisional infantry companies formed from artillery and engineer elements of the 66th Division, and about half of the 51st Reconnaissance Regiment belonged to General Matsuda's command. General Matsuda, a highly experienced officer, established his headquarters near the airfield of Cape Gloucester. On 5 October 1943, all of Matsuda's units came under the command of the 17th Division which was commanded by Lieutenant General Yasushi Sakai, who had arrived in December 1943 from the Japanese theater of operations in China. Lieutenant General Yasushi Sakai, Commander of 17th Division General Sakai set up his headquarters at Malalia in the vicinity of Cape Hoskins on the East Williaumez Peninsula. The 17th Division's troops began immediately ordering the expansions of the defensive lines. The Japanese headquarters was established in an existing concrete bunker at the foot of Talawe Mountain, which was surrounded by dense, tropical vegetation. Smaller bunkers and shelters for machine gun positions were sited at possible Allied landing beaches five miles southeast of Cape Gloucester. Two hills known later as Target-Hill and Hill 660 served as focal points for the Japanese defenses. Thus about half of all available Japanese troops in the west of the island were in positions that could effectively contribute to the defense of Cape Gloucester. On 12 December 1943, General Yasushi Sakai advised all commanders of his units about an imminent Allied invasion. The large volumes of Allied landing ships along the ports of New Guinea did not convince the Japanese of the scheduled operations of Allied forces. False invasion alarms were commonplace up to the end of 1943. With the Allies' air superiority increasing, the bombing of Rabaul and Wewak brought the realization that the invasion of New Britain was imminent. ==Preparatory actions== Reconnaissance Two days after the decision to proceed with the operation was taken by the Allied commanders, the US 6th Army's Alamo Scouts began to deploy in the area of Cape Gloucester. They neared the coast by torpedo boat, then transferred to dinghies and landed on the beaches. From there they reconnoitered the Japanese defenses by direct observations or through contact with the local aboriginal population of New Britain.

Today, this trail allows hikers to visit several interesting sites, as well as, providing several loops of different lengths. The route begins at Whiskey Bend Trailhead, at the end of Whiskey Bend road, approximately 5 miles from the Elwha Ranger Station. It travels for about 1.3 miles along the Elwha River trail, before the first descent down approximately 400 feet to Goblins Gate at the head of Rica Canyon. The trail continues along the Elwha River through a riparian forest of bigleaf maple, red alder, black cottonwood, with Douglas fir, Western red cedar, and Grand fir. The trail passes the alder grove of Krause Bottom, where the first possible loop back up the slope heads up, and some old homesteader clearings, before arriving at Humes Ranch Cabin, approximately 3 miles from the trailhead. Humes Ranch Cabin is maintained today by the National Park Service as a historic site, and the meadows below the cabin are kept open as Humes once did. You can also see 100-year-old fruit trees in the pastures. Approximately 3/4 of a mile further, the trail climbs the eroding cliffs along the river and crosses Dodger point bridge at the mouth of the Grand Canyon of the Elwha. This marks the end of Geyser Valley, but the trail continues for 11 miles up to the summit of Dodger Point Mountain at over 5,700 ft. It is possible to begin looping back to the Elwha river trail, by slowly climbing the slope. The trail will meet the short-cut coming up from Humes Ranch Cabin and then will pass the old homestead of Michael's Cabin. The trail then heads back on a level grade back towards Whiskey Bend trailhead. Homesteaders historically reported seeing enormous numbers of salmon coming up the river each year to spawn. However, salmon have been blocked from the upper 65 miles of river habitat with the construction of the Elwha Dam in 1913. However, both the Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam were removed in 2012. As part of the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project, Chinook salmon began returning to the Geyser Valley. ==Gallery== Image:Humes.jpgHumes Ranch Cabin Homestead Site Image:Elwha River - Dodger Point Bridge3.JPGDodger Point Bridge Image:Elwha River - Humes Ranch Area2.JPGGeyser Valley of the Elwha River ==External links== *Humes Ranch Loop Description Category:Hiking trails in Olympic National Park Category:Protected areas of Clallam County, Washington Category:Transportation in Clallam County, Washington ","title":"Geyser Valley trail"},{"id":"19350400","text":"Audrey Freyja Clarke is an Icelandic figure skater.

It achieved notoriety during the time of the Spanish Second Republic. The PG grouped a number of historical Galician intellectuals, and was fundamental in the elaboration of the Galician Statute of Autonomy. ==Origins== In December 1931 the ' (Galicianist Party of Pontevedra), directed by Castelao and Alexandre B√≥veda, called for a General Nationalist Assembly in order to create an all-Galician nationalist party. A total of 32 Galicianist organizations attended, including the Irmandades da Fala (Brotherhoods of the Language) and the Partido Nazonalista Republic√°n de Ourense (Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense), among others. The PG was a plural party hosting different political tendencies, and where internal tensions were not uncommon. The PG initially embraced: * Right-wing conservatives, who rejected the idea of forming alliances with left-wing parties. These were individuals such as Vicente Risco, Vilar Ponte, Filgueira Valverde * Liberals, such as Otero Pedrayo, Pl√°cido Castro * Left-wing sympathizers, such as Alexandre B√≥veda, Castelao, Carvalho Calero, Su√°rez Picallo, Joh√°n Vicente Viqueira, √Ålvaro das Casas, Ram√≥n Vilar Ponte, * Supporters of the Galician secession, such as Fuco G√≥mez or the Buenos Aires organization Sociedade Nazionalista Gallega Pondal * Non-aligned: √Ålvaro Cunqueiro, L√≥pez Cuevillas ==Political ideas== The political programme of the PG revolved around the ideals established by the Irmandades da Fala,Beramendi and N√∫√±ez Seixas (1996:148) that is, considering Galicia as a cultural unit entitled to political self-determination. In order to achieve this the minimum required was forming a Galician Parliament and a Galician Government. It also aimed at eliminating clientelism, supporting anti-imperialism and equal rights for the women. Furthermore, the PG claimed for the suppression of the provincial governments (perceived as a redundant administrative structure) and the establishment of the parish as an official territorial tier. Official status for the Galician language and agrarian reform were also in the agenda. Independence was never a priority for the PG, as independentists were a minority within the party. It was thought that Galicia could operate within the framework of a Spanish federal republic. Yet, War and the impossibility to establish such a federal republic led to disappointment. In a later stage, around 1944, PG's president and intellectual leader, Castelao, began to consider the option of full independence.See full article on Castelao Members of the PG expressed a strong pro- Europeanism,Castelao often commented on his wish to \\"one day see the emergence of a 'United States of Europe' \\" (Sempre en Galiza, 1944). situating the party ahead of its time on this issue. They also supported the strengthening of the League of Nations (predecessor of the UN) as a tool to solve international conflicts. In 1933, the PG successfully requested the admission of Galicia into the League as a stateless nation. Those negotiations were conducted by Pl√°cido Castro.Arrizado, F. (2008). Setembro de 1933: Galiza, unha naci√≥n en Europa. Vieiros.Fundaci√≥n Pl√°cido Castro. Pl√°cido Ram√≥n Castro del R√≠o. IGADI. ==Consolidation== In 1932 the PG works alongside the Partido Republicano Gallego (Galician Republican Party) and Acci√≥n Republicana (Republican Action) in the drafting and promotion of the Statute of Autonomy. The PG negotiates a number of pacts with local parties and in 1933 it takes part in the local elections, obtaining a single local deputy for Ourense. This issue opens the debate in the PG, as some wanted to seek alliances with republican parties (left-wing), something which was frontally rejected by the conservatives. The conservative pressure within the party forces PG to take part at the 1933 general Spanish elections on its own. The 106,000 votes obtained are not enough to grant a seat at the Spanish Parliament. Furthermore, the new conservative Spanish government halts the development of the Statute of Autonomy, bans PG's newspaper A Nosa Terra, and relocates Castelao and B√≥veda far from Galicia (they were civil servants). In its Third Assembly, January 1934, the PG eventually decides to ally with left-wing republican parties, with the opposition of Vicente Risco. This decision is ratified in the Fourth Assembly, April 1935, this time with the opposition of Otero Pedrayo. Thus, the conservative sector leaves the PG to found Dereita Galeguista (Galicianist Right-Wing). The PG then openly becomes a left-wing party. ==Frente Popular== In June 1935 the PG initiates negotiations with Izquierda Republicana (Republican Left), and in January 1936 the PG decides to integrate itself in the Frente Popular (Popular Front). Hence, the PG presented five Galicianist candidates to the Spanish general election of 1936, namely: Castelao, B√≥veda, Xerardo √Ålvarez Gallego, Ram√≥n Su√°rez Picallo and Ant√≥n Villar Ponte. In the province of Lugo the PG ran on its own, since specific pacts for that province could not be formalized, thus obtaining no representatives. However, out of the five candidates the PG obtains three seats in the Spanish Parliament. These are Castelao, S√∫arez Picallo and Vilar Ponte, with a combined total of some 287,000 votes. As a consequence, in June 1936 the Statute of Autonomy is put to the vote with the help of the Frente Popular, and the \\"yes\\" wins with an overwhelming majority. ==Civil War== Following the revolt of general Francisco Franco in July 1936, and the start of the Spanish Civil War, normal political life comes to an end. Galicia soon falls under the control of Franco's Nationalist troops and PG members are prosecuted. Some of them are captured and executed, such as Joh√°n Carballeira, √Ånxel Casal, Manuel Lustres Rivas, Camilo D√≠az Bali√±o, V√≠ctor Casas or one of the main leaders of the party, Alexandre B√≥veda. Others are forced into exile, like the president of the party, Castelao, who was in Madrid when the war started and managed to flee. In 1937 the PG establishes a delegation in Barcelona, still a republican area, and publishes the magazine Nova Galicia between April 1937 and July 1938. Castelao and Su√°rez Picallo call for the unity of all democratic forces in Spain to preserve the Republic, while maintaining the Galicianist ideals. In 1938, after the fall of Barcelona, the Galicianists in the area move to France and from there to South America. ==The underground== As soon as the Civil War ended in 1939, Galicianists tried to get in touch again in order to rebuild the party in Galicia. The PG appeared in the underground in July 1943, when 19 members meet in Coruxo and decide to form a temporary executive committee, including Manuel G√≥mez Rom√°n, Otero Pedrayo and Pl√°cido Castro. Yet, in this new period, Francisco Fern√°ndez del Riego and Ram√≥n Pi√±eiro had the most active role. One of the priorities was to establish contacts with the rest of the Galician opposition to the Francoist regime, and also with Basque and Catalan nationalists. In 1944 the PG forms together with the Spanish Socialist Party, CNT, UGT, and other trade unions, the Junta Gallega de Alianza Democr√°tica (Galician Union for the Democratic Alliance). Ram√≥n Pi√±eiro was detained in 1946. Ferm√≠n Penzol took responsibility for keeping contact with the other organizations. With the release of Pi√±eiro in 1949, and in the light that the underground activity did not produce any palpable results,Fern√°ndez del Riego (1990:190) the PG led by Pi√±eiro decides to prioritise the defence of Galician culture, gradually abandoning the political activity. This was severely criticised by the Galicianists in exile. Hence, the foundation of the ' publishing house, in 1950 marks the self-dissolution of the PG in Galicia. From that date militants in Galicia take part in the new cultural strategy, which revolved around Galaxia. ==The PG in the Americas== In 1932 a branch of the PG was created in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was the Organizacion Nazionalista Repubricana Galega (Galician Republican Nationalist Organization). It had 150 members and was led by Rodolfo Prada. At the time of the Civil War it changes its name to Grupo Galeguista de Bos Aires (Galicianist Group of Buenos Aires). In 1941 it takes the name of Irmandade Galega (Galician Brotherhood). In 1942, with the massive arrival or Galician expatriates to Buenos Aires (including Castelao), this same group relaunches the PG newspaper A Nosa Terra. In 1944, Irmandade Galega, with the support of Castelao, establish the Consello de Galiza, a sort of Galician government in exile. There was also a branch of the PG in Uruguay, named Irmandade Galeguista do Uruguai, led my Manuel Meil√°n. In 1949 the PG only had a total of some 200 active militants scattered around Buenos Aires and other Argentinian cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), Mexico and Havana (Cuba). With the cessation of the political activities of the PG in Galicia, the PG abroad quickly faded out, especially after the death of Castelao, the historical leader of the party, in 1950. ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * Beramendi, J.

Sixteen-year-old grade 9 pupil Jacques Pretorius was killed, and two campus gardeners and a second pupil were seriously injured. Harmse later pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and three charges of attempted murder, and was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. Harmse was reported to have \\"followed\\" the practice of Satanism. Harmse had acquired a mask that resembled one of a member of the American heavy metal band Slipknot, had donned a dress similar to the band's drummer, Joey Jordison, on the morning of the attack, and had been listening to the band for months prior to the attack. == The attack == At about 7:00 a.m. (SAST), Harmse arrived at school in his school uniform, wearing a brown mask and with black paint on his face. The mask was reported to be an imitation of the one Slipknot lead vocalist Corey Taylor wears, which Harmse had referred to as the \\"maggot mask\\" but the media claimed that it resembled Joey Jordison's own mask and not Taylor's. Two other masks were found in Harmse's bag: a clown mask from a Hollywood costume store similar to Shawn Crahan's, and a handmade papier-m√¢ch√© with drilled holes, painted with tribal marks. Three samurai swords were also found in his bag, which included a Sekizo ninja sword and a small katana. { style=\\"float:right; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:18em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 2px; background-color: #F19F5F5; text-left;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Victims - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\\" 1.

Harmse walked down a passage and slashed 17-year-old Stefan Bouwer on the head, and was immediately confronted by two school groundskeepers, Joseph Kodiseng and Simon Manamela, who were both slashed and injured. All three were taken to hospital. Harmse's attack was concluded when he sat down on a brick wall and stuck the sword in the ground, which was grabbed by his younger brother, Corn√©, who was standing nearby. At about 7:45 a.m., Harmse was escorted to the principal's office, and fifteen minutes later was arrested by police without incident. He was temporarily held in the custody of the Krugersdorp Police Station. == Conviction == On 20 August 2008, Harmse was charged with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder at the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court. He was later sent to the Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital for mental health evaluation. On 25 October, after two consecutive months of mental health evaluation and two postponements of the court date, Harmse was ruled to be mentally fit by Magistrate Joachim Nortje. The case was transferred to the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg for trial in front of Judge Gerhardus Hattingh. On 14 April 2009 Harmse pleaded guilty to all four charges, and on 10 October, he was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. == Reactions ==  Blame on Satanism and media  In the aftermath of the attacks, blame was put on Satanism, which Harmse took an interest in. Harmse claimed that Satan had told him to do it, and that he followed the practice of Satanism. When police executed a search in Harmse's room, they found \\"disturbing elements of Satanism\\" that included ouija boards and \\"spell books.\\" Heavy metal act Slipknot was also blamed for the attacks as Harmse had obtained masks resembling those of the band members, and was reportedly listening to the band months before. Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor later issued a response to Harmse's actions:  Apology  The parents of Morn√© Harmse, Machiel and Liza Harmse, issued a formal apology to the Pretorius family. == References  External links == *The Times: Morn√© Harmse in Court (Flash audio clip) Category:2008 crimes in South Africa Category:August 2008 crimes Category:Murder in South Africa Category:Deaths by blade weapons Category:Crimes involving Satanism or the occult Category:2000s murders in South Africa Category:2008 murders in Africa ","title":"Nic Diederichs Technical High School slashing"},{"id":"19350553","text":"__NOTOC__  The Lat√©co√®re 15 was a French airliner built in 1925 for use on Lat√©co√®re's own airline on routes between France and Morocco. It was a parasol-wing monoplane of conventional design, with twin engines mounted among the wing bracing struts, and small stub wings fitted to the lower fuselage as a mounting point for these struts and for the main undercarriage units. Six passengers could be carried in an enclosed cabin, and the pilot sat in an open cockpit in the nose. The design was soon found to be seriously underpowered, unable to take off with the maximum load intended by the design, and unable to stay aloft on only one engine. Therefore, while Pierre-Georges Lat√©co√®re had intended for the aircraft to be used to extend the line's existing route to Casablanca over the desert to Dakar, the pilot assigned to fly it, Didier Daurat, flatly refused to do so. In the end, Daurat's view prevailed, and the ten Lat√©co√®re 15s were used on the Oran-Casablanca route and short feeder routes into Casablanca before being withdrawn from service between 1926 and 1929. One of the aircraft was fitted with pontoons and trialled on a route between Alicante and Oran as the Lat√©co√®re 15H, but this was not deemed successful, and the aircraft was converted back. Lat√©co√®re 19 photo from L'A√©ronautique January,1926 The third prototype was built as a bomber, with a modified fuselage but otherwise unchanged. It was known as the Lat√©co√®re 19. It had a fixed Vickers machine gun in the nose, an open dorsal turret with a Lewis machine gun and another Lewis gun mounted to fire down through a ventral port. There were bomb racks in the place of the passenger cabin, as well as ventral hooks for other ordnance. ==SpecificationsReferences== * * * aviafrance.com * –£–≥–æ–ª–æ–∫ –Ω–µ–±–∞ Category:1920s French airliners 1 ","title":"Lat√©co√®re 15"},{"id":"19350574","text":"Aaron Curry (born April 6, 1986) is an American college football coach and former linebacker who played in the National Football League.

Considered only a two-star recruit by both Rivals and Scout.com,Rivals.com ProfileScout.com Profile Curry chose to play college football at Wake Forest over East Carolina,Curry shines in workout, makes claim for No. 1 pick the only two scholarships he was offered. Curry said he chose Wake Forest in part because it was two hours from home, but mostly for revenge. \\"Anybody who passed me up, I was going to punish them. That's why I chose the ACC, [because] those schools like Carolina, Duke, and North Carolina State were right around the corner, and I wasn't wanted by any of them.\\" ==College career== As a freshman in 2005 he started 10 of 11 games and was the team's fifth leading tackler with 39. After his great season he was named second team Freshman All-American and ACC All-Freshman Team by the Sporting News.

Considered a \\"safe pick\\", he was even in the debate for the No. 1 pick overall‚Äîwhich would've made him the first linebacker selected first overall since Aundray Bruce in 1988. ESPN's Mel Kiper, Jr. compared Curry to Keith Bulluck. Curry was drafted fourth overall by the Seattle Seahawks in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was the highest drafted linebacker since LaVar Arrington went second overall in the 2000 NFL Draft to the Washington Redskins, and the highest Wake Forest Demon Deacon since Norm Snead went second overall to the Washington Redskins in the 1961 NFL Draft. Seattle Seahawks On August 8, 2009, Curry signed a six-year, $60 million contract including $34 million guaranteed, the most money ever guaranteed to a non-quarterback rookie in NFL history.. Curry became the starting strongside linebacker for the Seahawks immediately. In his first career game against the St. Louis Rams he recorded four tackles. He recorded his first career sack against Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in week 3. In 2009, Curry recorded 61 tackles and 2 sacks, and in 2010, he compiled 73 tackles and 3.5 sacks. In 2011, he lost his starting position to rookie K. J. Wright after just two starts. Since he failed to meet the expectations of a high draft pick, Curry is widely considered to be a draft bust. Oakland Raiders Curry was traded to the Oakland Raiders on October 12, 2011, in exchange for a seventh-round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional pick in 2013. On November 16, 2012, Curry was fined $23,625 for two offenses against the Baltimore Ravens.

The F√©d√©ration de Rugby du Qu√©bec is affiliated with the Canadian Rugby Union. The F√©d√©ration de Rugby du Qu√©bec origins are hard to trace for two reasons. First, rugby union in Canada converged with and then later split from the game of Canadian football, often with rugby football unions representing both games, thus making an exact history hard to establish. Second, the F√©d√©ration de Rugby du Qu√©bec has not put a great emphasis on maintaining detailed historical records. This has led to gaps in its administrative and competition history and the lost information may never be known. The Westmount Rugby Club traces its roots back to 1876 or 1878, and some sort of organized rugby has been played in Qu√©bec ever since. In the 1920s and 1930s many clubs made the transition to professional or semi-professional football. Regardless, several leagues were formed during the 1950s that were not associated with the Qu√©bec Rugby Union. This changed in the later 1960s and in the late 1970s the union officially changed its name to the F√©d√©ration de Rugby du Qu√©bec. The FRQ has many differing levels and types of competition. There are two predominate competitions that have the longest historical record. The first is the Premier Championship Cup, which is awarded annually to the best rugby team in cup competition. This has also been known as the \\"Quebec Cup\\", Senior Cup, the First Division Cup, the A Division Cup and (formerly) the Standard Life Cup and can trace its origins back to the 1950s. The second oldest championship is the Intermediate Cup, awarded to the best club team in the second side cup competition. This has also been known as the Second Division Cup, the B Division Cup and the Des O'Neill Trophy. ==Original clubs== As leagues in Montr√©al and the St. Lawrence Rugger and Cricket Association were formed, the first cohort of modern clubs was founded. * Montreal Barbarians RFC - founded in 1953 and primarily located in the West Island of Montr√©al, this suburban club was Qu√©bec champions in 1957, 1963 and 1964, was First Division champs in 1997 to 1999 and 2002 to 2006 and, finally, was Second Division champs in 1997 to 1999 and 2001 to 2006. * Westmount Rugby Club - possibly the oldest rugby club in North America, this team, once known as the Montreal (Rugby) Football Club, merged the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association and later became the Montreal Scottish RFC. After some members left to form the Wanderers and Barbarians, the club settled down in Westmount, and during its glory years in the 1960s challenged for many titles. *Town of Mount Royal RFC - founded in 1955,http://www.tmrrugby.com members of this club would later found the Montreal Irish Rugby Football Club. Situated in TMR and owners of its own clubhouse, this club once was a league powerhouse. *Montreal Wanderers RFC - founded in 1957 as an offshoot of Westmount Rugby Club, and now located in Verdun, this team was one of the premier teams in eastern Canada during the 1960s. * Montreal Irish Rugby Football Club - founded in 1957, this urban based team later moved out to its own grounds and clubhouse in the rural suburbs of Montr√©al. Once a powerhouse, with First Division championships in 1958, 1959, 1969 and 1982, and a Second Division title in 1982. The club has more recently returned to prominence winning the Premier Division Championship in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 ==First Expansion== The union began to expand in the 1970s and 1980s, with its first wave of new clubs. Additionally, for a good part of the 1970s several Ottawa based rugby teams regularly completed in the QRU, including the Ottawa Indians, Ottawa Irish, Ottawa Beavers, Ottawa Scottish and the Deep River Blues. Of particular importance was the entry of the Club de rugby Parc olympique into the FRQ, as it was the first primarily francophone team in the federation. * Ormstown Saracens RFC - formed in 1972, this was the first rural based team in the union. They challenged for and won several championships during the 1970s and 1980s. The Ormstown Saracens Rugby Football Club wear red and navy blue. * Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue RFC - known commonly as \\"SABRFC\\", Ste-Anne-de-Bellvue RFC originated around 1964 as the McDonald College (the agricultural school of McGill University) team situated in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue on the westernmost part of the island of Montr√©al. Officially changed to Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue RFC in 1981, they have been the dominate team in the FRQ, winning 16 Senior titles (81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 07, 08, 09, 12, 13) and 11 Intermediate titles (83, 86, 87, 89, 91, 92, 02, 09, 10, 11, 13). In 2013, SABRFC's three Senior Men's teams swept the FRQ Premiership, Reserves, and Division IV leagues. * Montreal Grads RFC - originally the McGill Graduates, formed by grads of that university, this popular social side played at Trenholme Park in Notre Dame de Grace during the 1970s and 1980s, after which it disbanded, never winning a cup. * Chateauguay River Rats RFC - this successful but short lived team played on the South Shore and won one Second Division title during its time in the 1980s. * Beaconsfield RFC - formed in 1983 and playing in the West Island, this team took many of its talented players from the English language high schools of the area, and later progressed to the First Division. They won the 2nd Division championship in 1984 and 2007. * St. Lambert Locks RFC - formed in 1984 this South Shore team won the Second Division title in 1984 and 1986, and has added Senior titles in 1995, 96 and 2000. Members of this club would form the Montreal Exiles. * Club de rugby Parc olympique - formed in 1983 and originally situated at the training field at the Olympic Stadium, this highly competitive team won several titles. Its greatest significance was that it was the first francophone team in what was predominately an anglophone organization. The formation of this team marked a true turning point in the history of rugby in Qu√©bec. * Brome Lake Ducks RFC - formed in 1986 and the first team to be situated in the Eastern Townships, this young club survived many enjoyable but hard fought seasons to eventually become a two time championship team (2005 and 2006.) ==Recent Expansion== The FRQ experienced substantial growth in the past two decades, and has added many new clubs, especially because rugby now enjoys a much greater popularity in French language school boards. *Sherbrooke Abenakis RFC - founded in 1998 *Barracudas Rugby de St-Jean sur Richelieu *Le Mirage de Gatineau - part of L‚Äôassociation de Rugby R√©gionale de l‚ÄôOutaouais * Les Braves de Trois-Rivi√®res - founded in 1993 *Beauport Logers - which merged later with CR Quebec *Club de rugby les Nomades Laval-Laurentides-Lanaudi√®res - founded in 1990, located in Laval *Les Patriotes du Vieux-Montr√©al - founded 2005 *Club de Rugby de Qu√©bec - founded in 2001 as Club r√©gional de Rugby de Qu√©bec, merged with Le Celtique de Ste-Foy in 2005.

It may be referred to simply as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). It is considered to be a pre-malignancy, or carcinoma in situ, of the prostatic glands. ==Signs and symptoms== HGPIN in isolation is asymptomatic. It is typically discovered in prostate biopsies taken to rule-out prostate cancer and very frequently seen in prostates removed for prostate cancer. Relation to prostate cancer There are several reasons why PIN is the most likely prostate cancer precursor. PIN is more common in men with prostate cancer. High grade PIN can be found in 85 to 100% of radical prostatectomy specimens, nearby or even in connection with prostate cancer. It tends to occur in the peripheral zone of the prostate. With age, it becomes increasingly multifocal, like prostate cancer. Molecular analysis has shown that high grade PIN and prostate cancer share many genetic abnormalities. This has been confirmed in a transgenic mouse model. The risk for men with high grade PIN of being diagnosed with prostate cancer after repeat biopsy has decreased since the introduction of biopsies at more than six locations (traditional sextant biopsies). ==Histology== High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. HGPIN typically has one of four different histologic patterns: *tufted, *micropapillary, *cribriform and, *flat. Its cytologic features are that of prostatic adenocarcinoma: *presence of nucleoli, *increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and, *increased nuclear size. Microscopically, PIN is a collection of irregular, atypical epithelial cells. The architecture of the glands and ducts remains normal. The epithelial cells proliferate and crowding results in a pseudo-multilayer appearance. They remain fully contained within a prostate acinus (the berry-shaped termination of a gland, where the secretion is produced) or duct. The latter can be demonstrated with special staining techniques (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins) to identify the basal cells forming the supporting layer of the acinus. In prostate cancer, the abnormal cells spread beyond the boundaries of the acinus and form clusters without basal cells. In HGPIN, the basal cell layer is disrupted but present. PIN is primarily found in the peripheral zone of the prostate (75-80%), rarely in the transition zone (10-15%) and very rarely in the central zone (5%), a distribution that parallels the zonal distribution for prostate carcinoma. Because it is thought to be a premalignant state, PIN is often considered the prostate equivalent of what is called carcinoma in situ (localized cancer) in other organs. However, PIN differs from carcinoma in situ in that it may remain unchanged or even spontaneously regress. Several architectural variants of PIN have been described, and many cases have multiple patterns. The main ones are tufting, micropapillary, cribriform, and flat. Although these different appearances may cause confusion with other conditions, they have not been found to be of clinical importance. Rarer types are signet-ring-cell, small-cell-neuroendocrine, mucinous, foamy, inverted, and with squamous differentiation. ==Diagnosis== HGPIN is diagnosed from tissue by a pathologist, which may come from: *a needle biopsy taken via the rectum and, *surgical removal of prostate tissue: **transurethral resection of the prostate - removal of extra prostate tissue to improve urination (a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia), **radical prostatectomy - complete removal of prostate and seminal vesicles (a treatment for prostate cancer). Blood tests for prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, ultrasound scanning of the prostate via the rectum, fine needle aspiration or medical imaging studies (such as magnetic resonance imaging) are not useful for diagnosing HGPIN. ==Treatment== HGPIN in isolation does not require treatment. In prostate biopsies it is not predictive of prostate cancer in one year if the prostate was well-sampled, i.e. if there were 8 or more cores. The exact timing of repeat biopsies remains an area of controversy, as the time required for, and probability of HGPIN transformations to prostate cancer are not well understood. ==Prognosis== On a subsequent biopsy, given a history of a HGPIN diagnosis, the chance of finding prostatic adenocarcinoma is approximately 30%. ==History== PIN was historically subdivided into different stages, based on the level of cell atypia. PIN was formerly classified as PIN 1, 2 or 3, in order of increasing cell irregularities. Nowadays, PIN 1 is referred to as low grade PIN, and PIN 2 and PIN 3 are grouped together as high grade PIN. Only high grade PIN has been shown to be a risk factor for prostate cancer. Because low grade PIN has no significance and does not require repeat biopsies or treatment, it is not mentioned in pathology reports. As such, PIN has become synonymous with high grade PIN. ==See also== *Atypical small acinar proliferation ==References External links == Category:Male genital neoplasia Category:Histopathology ","title":"High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia"},{"id":"19350687","text":"Faris Island (alternate: Ferris Island) is one of the many uninhabited Canadian arctic islands in Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut.

It is located west-northwest of Nome, Alaska. It is the former Tin City Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-04, LRR ID: A-11). The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the command of the 611th Air and Space Operations Center, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. ==History== Tin City AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. It was one of the ten original radar surveillance sites constructed during the early 1950s to establish a permanent air defense system in Alaska. The station was located at the westernmost tip of the Seward Peninsula, also the most westerly point of land on the North American continent. Two small islands, the Little and Big Diomedes, are located in the Bering Straits 25 miles west of the station. Little Diomede Island is part of the United States, while Russia claims Big Diomede, making it the closest Russian territory to the United States. The Asian mainland of Siberia is 48 miles to the west of the station. On a clear day, both islands and the Siberian coastline are visible. The radars were located on the southern base Cope Mountain, at an elevation of 2,275 feet. Construction of the station, first designated Cape Prince of Wales AFS (after the geographic location Cape Prince of Wales), began on 9 September 1950 and was completed in late 1952. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project, code name Mona Lisa, of getting the initial supplies and equipment to the construction site. The only means of getting construction materials and supplies to the site was by barge or Navy LSTs, however this was restricted to when the sea was not frozen and had to be unloaded 3 miles from the proposed site. Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort. Each item had to be hauled along the beach to the area nearest the construction site, then inland to the permanent storage area. The ground support station was located on a plateau, at an elevation of 270 feet, located in a small canyon between the airstrip and radar site . A 4,500' airstrip was constructed on a plateau east of the ground support station, with a gravel runway capable of C-130 landings. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The inaccessibility made the personnel at the site responsible for maintenance if anything went wrong. Water mains occasionally froze and ruptured. The radar site was connected to the base station by a 7,200' aerial tramway, the longest in North America. All large equipment was required to be disassembled then re- assembled at the top camp radar station. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter. The 710th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq), activated on 8 December 1952, provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Murphy Dome AFS near Fairbanks, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Radars operated at the station were AN/FPS-3, and an AN/FPS-20A. The station name was changed to Tin City Air Force Station on 1 September 1959. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Tin City site was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Tin City AFS received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program . It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 710th AC&W; Sq was inactivated on 1 November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Tin City LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. ==Current status== Today very little of the former Tin City Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the PACAF's 611th Air and Space Operations Center, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is maintained by ARCTEC Alaska Inc. civilian contractors and they access the site by former support airstrip, now the Tin City LRRS Airport and provide maintenance and support when needed to maintain the radar system. Tin City ops reported to Campion AFS (near Galena), not to Murphy Dome. ==Air Force units and assignments == Emblem of the 710th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron Units * 710th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Activated 8 December 1953 : Inactivated 1 November 1983 Assignments * 160th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, 8 December 1952 * 548th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, 5 February 1953 * 11th Air Division, 18 April 1953 * 5001st Air Defense Group 20 September 1954 * 10th Air Division, 1 October 1955 * 5060th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, 1 November 1957 * 11th Air Division, ca. 1 July 1959 * 5070th Air Defense Wing, 1 August 1960 * Alaskan Air Command, 1 November 1961 * 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (later 11th Tactical Control Group, 11th Tactical Control Wing, 11th Air Control Wing, 611th Air Operations Group, 611th Air and Space Operations Center) 15 July 1977 ==See also== * Tin City, Alaska * Alaskan Air Command ==References== * Alaskan Air Defenses * Information for Murphy Dome AFS, AK ==External links== *Tin City Air Force Site, Department of Defence Film (Reuters Historical Collection), 1964 *Murphy Dome ski area Category:Radar stations of the United States Air Force Category:Installations of the United States Air Force in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures in Nome Census Area, Alaska Category:1952 establishments in Alaska Category:Military installations established in 1952 ","title":"Tin City Long Range Radar Site"},{"id":"19350711","text":"Potatoes O'Brien is a dish of pan-fried potatoes along with green and red bell peppers.

Prior to his career in politics, he was also an administrator in the education sector. He has been appointed as the Advisor to the President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed. == Education == Ibra completed his secondary education at Majeediyya School and in the Science Education Centre in Mal√© before attending the University of Canberra in Australia where he completed his bachelor's degree. He then went on to read for his master's degree in Education Administration at the University of Canberra for which Ibra received a commendation for his thesis. While he was a postgraduate student in Canberra, Ibra presented a research paper at the Annual Conference of the Australian Council for Education Administration in which he presented a new theory on educational systems in small island states. == Government Service == After completing his post-graduate studies, Ibra returned to Mal√© and started his career at the Ministry of Education as a Research Analyst. Ibra‚Äôs first personal experience of the real lack of political freedom in the Maldives came about in 1996, at a meeting of government officials, when he stated that the Treasury should reduce the state budget for the Presidential Palace. Ibra was placed under arrest for 45 days. He was then transferred to the Department of Public Examinations as an Assistant Director. == Political career == Ibra first came to public attention in 2004 during his campaign for a seat in the Special Majlis, the legislative assembly tasked with drafting the new constitution. In a letter he wrote to President Gayoom on 20 April 2004, well before the publication of the Government‚Äôs Reform Agenda on 9 June 2004, Ibra called for constitutional amendments and the introduction of a checks and balance system, to reduce the term of office for the President, to strengthen human rights, to strengthen accountability and transparency within the government and to put special emphasis on the separation of powers so that the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature may function independently in line with that of any other democratic society. == Private Work == In parallel to his public career, Ibra ran a consultancy firm. He started a training center to provide vocational skills in commercial service-based sectors. == Election to Public Office == In 2004, Ibra was elected to the Special Majlis for the Mal√© constituency. On 12 August 2004, the public gathered in the Republican Square in front of the Headquarters of the National Security Service to protest at the treatment by the Police of political activists. Ibra addressed the gathering. Security services arrested many members of the crowd. Ibra was arrested along with other reformists that day and spent 68 days in solitary confinement in Dhoonidhoo Prison, and numerous days under house arrest. Whilst under house arrest, Ibra contested one of the two seats allocated to the Male‚Äô constituency in the People‚Äôs Majlis (Parliament) and won. == Ibra & MDP == The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) was the first political party to be instigated in the Maldives in recent history and Ibra played a huge role in its foundation. He was one of the first 42 people to put their signatures to register the party and also functioned as a councilor for the party in Male‚Äô long before political parties were legalized in 2005. Ibra was elected to the post of Party President during its first Extra-Ordinary Congress, but later resigned as Party President in November 2006. == Member of the People‚Äôs Majlis == Since his election to the People‚Äôs Majlis, Ibra has introduced several bills: *Bill on Freedom of Assembly *Amendment on Article 81/68 (Bill on judicial access to private parties) *Amendment on Article 6/94 (Bill on religious unity) *Amendment on Article 1/81 *Amendment on Article 1/66 *Amendment on Article 1/81 *Amendment on Article 21/81 *Bill on Independence of Media Listed below are some proposals made by Ibra to the People‚Äôs Majlis *Inception of a Parliamentary Committee to look into the problems related to narcotics. *The refusal of the government to grant registration to non- governmental organisation. *The present status of the healthcare system. *The proposal to ease access to accommodation in Male‚Äô, for residents living in Male‚Äô. *Minimum wage for employment. *The need for approval by Majlis, all bylaws and regulations conferred to the people by various agencies of state. *Pension for employees *Treatment of prisoners by the authorities. *Improvement in utility services. *Improvement in corrections services. *Reduction in protectionist measures and the elimination of import tariffs. *Article 5/2007 of the Civil Service Bill. == Member of Special Majlis == Ibra is a member of the Drafting Committee for the Special Majlis tasked with completing the new constitution.

Japanese F3000/Formula Nippon Japan persisted with Formula Two rules for a couple of years after the demise of F2 in Europe, but then adopted basically F3000 rules in 1987. Unlike European F3000, the Japanese Championship featured much competition between tyre companies, and tended to feature highly paid drivers (both local and European) in cars tending to be more developed and tested than those in the European series. The Mugen engine dominated this series, and was also competitive in European F3000. Japanese F3000 was renamed Formula Nippon in 1996, and completely split off from European racing in 2009 with the new Swift chassis.

Built in 1912 as a Carnegie library for the city of Salem, the building now houses several programs of Willamette University College of Law. Prior to the law school's moving into the facility in 2008, the building was used by the adjacent Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) from 1971 to 2006. Willamette purchased the old library in 2003 and later selected the College of Law as the program at the school to gain use of the building. The university began renovations in 2007 to restore part of the original layout and modernize the facility to accommodate the needs of modern education. After the brick- faced, Beaux Arts style structure was remodeled, community oriented programs from the law school relocated to the renamed Oregon Civic Justice Center. This center houses programs such as a legal clinic and the school's law review journal. ==History== On October 12, 1901, the Salem Woman's Club was organized with the wife of Oregon Governor Theodore Thurston Geer serving as president of the organization.Green, Virginia. Salem's Woman's Club. Salem Public Library. Retrieved on September 14, 2008.

The library group hired a librarian, Miss F. Phillips, for a salary of $20 per month to run the library. In 1907, the group explored options to build a stand-alone library building using funds provided by Andrew Carnegie, who was providing funds for building libraries around the world. In May 1909, the Woman's Club purchased an option to buy the property on the southwest corner of Winter and State streets for $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000,Lynn, Capi. \\"Then & Now\\", Statesman Journal, September 11, 2008, Life, p. 1. and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women's Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman's Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem. The library in 1920 On September 12, 1912, the new library opened on the property near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, and much of the furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two stories tall, and a fireplace.Oregon Civic Justice Center: Dedication Ceremony. Willamette University College of Law, 2008. p. 7. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library. In 1914, the YWCA of Salem was organized by the same Salem Women's Club. Located in downtown on Cottage Street Northeast, the YWCA moved in 1954 to the lot adjoining the library.Tom, Susan. \\"YWCA set to sell its building\\", Statesman Journal, July 4, 2003, Local, p. 1C.\\"Women's\\", Statesman Journal, October 10, 2001, Local, p. 3C.Green, Carol.

A public campaign to build a new library began in 1968, with the library to be part of a larger government center that included a city hall and fire station. In 1971, the YWCA purchased the adjacent Carnegie library building for $150,000, and on July 6, 1972, the Salem Public Library vacated the Carnegie building and moved to Salem's new Civic Center located west of the old library. Located next to the YWCA's existing home, the old library was turned into the organization's youth center. The building was remodeled from 1990 to 1991.

The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building adjacent to the former library for a total of , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located.Willamette University Set to Renovate Former City Library. Willamette University. August 22, 2006. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and feel of the original 1912 building.

The university offers 15 preparatory schools located across the major regions of the state. The university offers 33 undergraduate degrees and 28 postgraduate degrees. Enrollment at the university level has been rising since 1996. Its library system holds more than 91,280 volumes in 29 libraries. ==History== The university was founded in 1969 by Dr. Julian Gascon Mercado, then governor of the state of Nayarit, through the City Patronage of Culture ‚ÄúAmado Nervo‚Äù and decree No. 5162. The founding of the university was made possible through a series of decrees dating back to 1925 by governors Felipe C. Rios and Ricardo Velarde which established a School of Jurisprudence and a Senior High School. By 1955, the School of Jurisprudence was combined with the Institute of the State, founded in 1930, to form the first antecedent to the University of Nayarit. The school continued to expand through the addition of the Normal School in 1958 and the School of Nursing in 1959. A major step toward foundation was made when Francisco Garcia Montero, then governor of Nayarit, issued decree No. 4466 containing the ‚Äúfundamental laws‚Äù of the Institute of Letters and Sciences legally conferring the school a decentralized public body whose duties include teaching at a preparatory and professional level and promoting social and scientific research. After becoming classified as a decentralized public body, Julian Gascon Mercado, created the City Patronage of Culture ‚ÄúAmado Nervo‚Äù and passed decree No. 5162 that formally transformed the loosely associated schools into the University of Nayarit. The university sought to achieve autonomous status after a series of reforms to the universities ‚Äúfundamental laws‚Äù by Roberto Gomez Reyes in 1975, granting the university self governance. These reforms were met with resistance, and the university did not achieve autonomous status until 1985. ==Student life== Federation of Students The Federation of Student of Autonomous University of Nayarit (FEUAN) is official entity encompassing student government. The federation was founded in 1981 for the purpose of acknowledging and responding to the needs of the student population. The Federation provides access to several academic programs including scholarships, student exchange programs, university forums and community English classes. The federation also provides access to several cultural, recreational, social, and athletic clubs. ==Departments== The university is composed of 14 departments that stretch across multiple campuses. *Center Specializing in Virtual Education *University Center of Social Sciences and Humanities *Academic Unit of Basic Sciences and Engineering *Academic Unit of Agriculture *Academic Unit of Accounting and Administration *Academic Unit of Chemistry, Biology and Pharmaceuticals *Academic Unit of Law *Academic Unit of Economics *Academic Unit of Nursing *Academic Unit of Medicine *Academic Unit of Veterinary Medicine and Husbandry *Academic Unit of Dentistry *Academic Unit of Tourism *Academic Unit of Fisheries ==References== Category:Public universities and colleges in Mexico Category:Universities and colleges in Nayarit Category:Educational institutions established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in Mexico ","title":"Autonomous University of Nayarit"},{"id":"19351196","text":"Zeyd may refer to: * Zeyid, Azerbaijan * Zeyd, Ilam, Iran * Bala Zeyd, Mazandaran Province, Iran * Pain Zeyd, Mazandaran Province, Iran * Zeyd, South Khorasan, Iran ","title":"Zeyd"},{"id":"19351200","text":"Saleh Youssef Fathy (born ) is a former Egyptian male volleyball player.

US 13 continues through the states of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware before its northern terminus in Pennsylvania. Most of the routing is rural, serving only three cities of considerable size along the entire route; the rest passes through forests and farmland. Most of US 13 in North Carolina is two lanes wide unless it is co-signed with other highways, usually near cities as bypasses. ==Route description== Interstate 95 to Newton Grove US 13 begins at a hybrid interchange incorporating elements of a cloverleaf, a directional-T, and a diamond, consisting of a junction with Interstate 95 (exit 58) and the Fayetteville Outer Loop near Fayetteville in Cumberland County. It quickly reduces its lane count from the four of the I-295 freeway to two lanes with dirt shoulders. It bears eastward, passing through sparsely developed forest and farm lands, quickly crossing the county border and entering Sampson County. The route turns slightly northeast and passes through Spivey's Corner, where the road intersects US 421, otherwise known as Spivey's Corner Highway. Nearing Newton Grove, US 13 passes over Interstate 40 with no direct access. The route then enters the small town and is interrupted by a large roundabout which brings three routes‚Äîitself; North Carolina Highway 50, Raleigh Street west and Mount Olive Drive east; and US 701, Main Street north and Clinton Street south‚Äîto a central point in the city. Newton Grove to Goldsboro Continuing north from Newton Grove, US 13 enters Wayne County, traveling more easterly through more farmland and forests. After several miles, it curves northeast and meets US 117 at an intersection. Here, it turns north on the four-lane, divided highway and begins to travel around the west side of Goldsboro, the beginning of a partial beltway around the city. Before turning east again, US 13 leaves US 117 at an at-grade intersection, the latter of which upgrades into a freeway. US 117 Bypass travels along with US 13. US 13 circles around the city on a four-lane, divided freeway alignment after another at-grade intersection, immediately interchanging with NC 581. Shortly after, it meets US 70 at a partial cloverleaf interchange, and US 70 joins the other two routes on its path east. The next interchange sends US 117 Alternate north at a partial trumpet interchange; US 117 continues north to the east of its parent until they both intersect US 264. US 13 and US 70 continue east, next interchanging NC 111. The road interchanges Wayne Memorial Drive and Spence Avenue before curving southward. The freeway then interchanges with Berkeley Boulevard, where US 13 leaves. US 70 continues on the freeway, while US 13 turns northeast on Berkeley Boulevard, leaving the Goldsboro area. Goldsboro to US 64 US 13 continues northeast, passing through one last community of Goldsboro before entering open fields and forests once again and entering Greene County. Outside Snow Hill, NC 58 joins US 13 and becomes Kingold Boulevard. US 13 leaves Kingold Boulevard once in the center of town, continuing northeast via Contentnea Boulevard. Contentnea Boulevard outside the city meets an intersection with US 258 and NC 903, which join US 13. The other side of the four way intersection continues as NC 91. NC 903 leaves after two curves of the road, leaving US 13 and 258 to continue northeast through farmland. US 13 leaves US 258 after a stretch, turning east to meet and run concurrent with US 264, Dickinson Avenue. This arrangement continues until Greenville, where US 264 leaves, and US 13 bisects the city on Memorial Drive, forming concurrencies with NC 43, NC 903 and NC 11. The concurrency eventually drops NC 43, and later picks up NC 33 and drops it, also dropping NC 903 before it heads northward. Still a four-lane divided road, it bypasses the town of Bethel before it meets a diamond interchange with the US 64 freeway in the corner of Edgecombe County. US 13 turns east onto this freeway, while NC 11 continues northward. US 64 to Virginia US 13 and US 64 travel eastward to Williamston. The roadway curves around the south and east sides of the city, where US 17 joins and US 64 leaves. US 13/17 continue north on a four lane alignment until Williamston, where it bypasses the town to the west. On the north side, though, US 13 leaves at an interchange on North King Street, traveling north on a two-lane road, while US 17 carries the freeway east towards the ocean. The road continues through the farm and forest medium until it enters Ahoskie on city streets, forming concurrencies with NC 42 and NC 561. These leave in the city before US 13 exits, finally crossing into Gates County along with US 158. The concurrency travels for a few miles, the roads separating before the Virginia state border. Here, US 13 continues into Virginia as Whaleyville Boulevard. Scenic byways Blue-Gray Scenic Byway is an byway from Four Oaks to Trenton. US 13 overlap a short section of the byway, from Bentonville Road to Grantham School Road, northeast of Newton Grove. The byway is noted for its Civil War history. Edenton-Windsor Loop is an is a double loop byway connecting the cities of Edenton and Windsor. US 13 and US 13 Business together form a short section of the loop, in Windsor. The byway is noted for historical homes in Edenton, the Sans Souci Ferry, the scenic river and coastal views, and history. Lafayette's Tour is an byway from Halifax to Lynch's Corner, in the Great Dismal Swamp. US 13 overlap a short section of the byway; from US 258, near Winton, to NC 137. The byway is noted and named after the French General Marquis de Lafayette, who visited the area in 1825. It is also noted for the Parker Island Cable Ferry, swamps/bogs, and history. ==History== Established in 1952, US 13 came south from Virginia; replacing NC 97 from the state line to Windsor, ending at US 17 (now NC 308). Around 1956, US 13 was extended south to Goldsboro; following: US 17 to Williamston, US 64 to Bethel, NC 11 to Greenville, US 264 to Farmville, US 258 to Snow Hill, NC 102 to Goldsboro. Following west on US 70, it ended at the US 117 interchange. In 1957, Windsor was bypassed, creating US 13 Business following the old downtown route. By 1960, US 13 was extended southwest again, replacing NC 102, to its current southern terminus at Interstate 95. In 1970, US 13 moved onto cutoff road between US 258 and US 264, removing Farmville completely from the route. In 1974, Winton was bypassed, the old alignment became part of NC 45 and NC 461. By 2000, US 13 was placed on new freeway from Bethel to Robersonville, with US 64; the old alignment became US 64 Alternate. In 2002, it was extended to Williamston. In 2004, Bethel was bypassed, creating US 13 Business following the old main street route.

It is a move that requires significant strength and balance. There are many variations of a planche, although only two are accredited in artistic gymnastics: the straddle planche, and the full planche. Somewhat less well known is the double planar planche. Depending on the event, it can range from a B to a D skill, and must be held for at least two seconds. As an example, on gymnastic rings, the straddle planche is a B move, and the full planche is a C move. On floor, straddle/full is A/B. The main muscle used in this exercise is the anterior deltoid, but the abdominals, chest, shoulders, upper back, lower back, and glutes also play important roles. As the planche is a demanding position, athletes train for it with a progression of simpler moves, advancing to the next when they have gained mastery of the intermediate positions. A typical training progression usually consists of the frog stand, advanced frog stand, tuck planche, advanced tuck planche, straddle planche, and then full planche. The arms should be locked at all times in all positions, except frog stand. == Muscles used== * Biceps * Bicep femoris * Deltoid * Gluteus maximus * Latissimus dorsi * Soleus * Supraspinatus * Trapezius *Tibials anterior * Lateralis * Wrist extensors == Possible injuries == * Torn ligaments/ tendons in arms * Wrist injury * Shoulder injury * Elbow injury ==See also== *Bodyweight exercise *Mayurasana *Plank (exercise) *Gymnastics ==References== Planche Category:Gymnastics manoeuvres ","title":"Planche (exercise)"},{"id":"19351229","text":"Alibi Bye Bye is a 1935 comedy short directed by Ben Holmes and released by RKO Radio Pictures.

After dancing and performing in pantomimes in Britain and then in Europe as a teenager in the 1850s, she became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage. She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the \\"British Blondes\\", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety. Her career began to decline in the 1890s, but she continued to perform into the early years of the 20th century. ==Early years== Thompson was born in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, London. Her father was Philip Thompson (c.1801‚Äì1842) and her mother was Eliza (n√©e Cooper). Her father owned the Sheridan Knowles, a public house. Thompson was the second of three surviving children, including actress Clara Bracy.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Lydia Thompson\\", Encyclopaedia of the Musical Theatre, Blackwell/Schirmer (1994) Her father died in 1842, and her mother remarried Edward Hodges.

Gilliland, \\"Thompson, Lydia (1838‚Äì1908)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 In 1852 she became a member of the corps de ballet at Her Majesty's Theatre. By the following year she was playing a solo role, Little Silverhair, in the pantomime Harlequin and the Three Bears, or, Little Silverhair and the Fairies at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1854 she danced at the old Globe Theatre in Blackfriars Road, in James Planch√©'s extravaganza, Mr Buckstone's Voyage Round the Globe. She gained wider public attention later that year at the St James's Theatre in The Spanish Dancers, a burletta by Thomas Selby, playing the famous dancer Se√±ora Perea Nena. The Times dismissed the piece but praised her performance highly: \\"It was no burlesque; it was one excellent dancer following in the steps of another, catching the spirit of her model, and rivalling her in the audacity of her execution. The youth and beauty of Miss Thompson gave an additional charm to her Andalusian feats.\\"The Times, 18 October 1854, p. 6 There, she also played in the burlesque Ganem, the Slave of Love, and in the ballet-farce Magic Toys. These performances brought a period of prosperity to what had come to be regarded as one of the unluckiest theatres in London.The Daily Mirror obituary, 19 November 1908, p.4 She also appeared that year in The King's Rival by Tom Taylor and Charles Reade (J.

She then returned to complete the season at the St James's in Cupid's Ladder and the fairy spectacle, The Swan and Edgar. ==Star dancer== Lydia Thompson Still a teenager, Thompson then toured through Europe for over three years. She danced in Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Scandinavia and elsewhere, \\"winning acclaim for the dexterity of her dancing ‚Äì which included the Highland Fling and Hornpipe ‚Äì as well as the charms of her person and the vivacity of her character.\\"Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob. \\"Desperately Seeking Lydia\\" and \\"Appreciating Lydia\\", The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine, Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1‚Äì7 She returned to England in the summer of 1859, by which time The Times referred to her as \\"one of the most eminent of English dancers\\".The Times, 3 October 1859, p. 7 In the winter season of 1859‚Äì60 Thompson danced at the St James's in several pieces, including Virginius, or, The Trials of a Fond Papa, Lester Buckingham's burlesque Virginus, Valentine in Magic Toys, Dolly Mayflower in Black-Eyed Susan and Young Norval in the ballet-burlesque My Name is Norval. In 1860, Thompson performed at Dublin's Queen's Theatre. In 1860‚Äì1861, at the Lyceum Theatre, she played again in Magic Toys, as Morgiana in the Savage Club burlesque of The Forty Thieves, in the farce The Middy Asthore, as Fanchette in George Loder's The Pets of the Parterre (Les Fleurs anim√©es) and as Mephisto in the fairy extravaganza Chrystabelle, or the Rose Without a Thorn. She also played Norah in the first production of Edmund Falconer's comedy Woman, or, Love Against the World, as Blondinette in Little Red Riding Hood and had a role in the William Brough burlesque of The Colleen Bawn, called The Colleen Bawn Settled at Last. Thompson married John Christian Tilbury, a riding-master, in 1863, and soon gave birth to a daughter. She returned to the stage in The Alabama at the Drury Lane Theatre. Her husband died fifteen months after their marriage, in a steeplechasing accident in 1864, when he was rolled on by his horse. In the following years, she alternated between London and provincial tours, mixing dancing and acting in plays. In 1864, at the opening of the new Theatre Royal, Birkenhead, managed by Alexander Henderson (1828‚Äì1886), she created the title role in a burlesque of Ixion by Francis Burnand. She joined Henderson's company at Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, together with the rising young actors Squire Bancroft, Marie Wilton and Henry Irving. There, she played in Brough's Ernani (1865), as Max in a burlesque of Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz (1866), as Prince Buttercup in The White Fawn, as Massaroni in the burlesque The Brigand, and as Prince Florizel in another burlesque, Perdita. Thompson excelled as \\"principal boy\\" in burlesques: \\"She was charming to look at, a good singer, a really clever dancer, and the life and soul of the scene while on the stage.\\" Other successful London runs from 1866 to 1868 included, at the Drury Lane, Sophonisba in Delibes' Wanted Husbands For Six (Six Demoiselles √† marier) and at the Strand Theatre, Blue-Beard (after Jacques Offenbach's version) and Darnley in the very successful The Field of the Cloth of Gold. 1868 programme for Ixion ==America and later years== Thompson in Robinson Crusoe, c. 1870 Thompson married Henderson, and the two sailed in August 1868 for America, heading a small theatrical troupe, adapting popular English burlesques for middle-class New York audiences by adding topical and local references and reworking the lyrics of popular songs, while preserving the rhymed couplets and comic puns of the burlesque form. Her groundbreaking burlesque was very new in America and initially received much acclaim. Thompson's first American show Ixion was a huge success. Their shows included wit, parody, song, dance, spectacle, music, and even empowered women. Thompson's troupe, called the \\"British Blondes\\", was the most popular entertainment in New York during the 1868‚Äì1869 theatrical season: \\"The eccentricities of pantomime and burlesque ‚Äì with their curious combination of comedy, parody, satire, improvisation, song and dance, variety acts, cross- dressing, extravagant stage effects, risqu√© jokes and saucy costumes ‚Äì while familiar enough to British audiences, took New York by storm.\\"\\"Amusements. Theatrical. Wood's Museum.\\" The New York Times, 1 October 1868 (review of Ixion). The six-month tour turned into an extremely successful tour of almost six years, and during two subsequent tours, the Blondes drew huge crowds at leading theatres across the US. The troupe launched careers of several actresses, including Markham, Alice Burville, Lisa Weber, and Rose Coghlan, and of comedian Willie Edouin. It also drew fierce criticism from those who felt it transgressed the boundaries of propriety. Burlesques, colloquially referred to as leg-shows, started off very tame, clever, and sophisticated, drawing in all types of people, especially women. Unfortunately, ‚Äúthe female audiences for burlesque did not last for long. In the summer of 1869 a wave of ‚Äòanti-burlesque hysteria‚Äô in the New York press frightened away the middle- class audiences that had initially been drawn to Ixion and sent the Thompson troupe prematurely packing for a national tour‚Äù.Dudden, Faye E. \\"The Rise of the Leg Show\\", Women in the American Theatre: Actresses and Audeiences, New Haven, Yale UP (1994) After this untimely closure, the hatred toward American burlesque continued to grow. Thompson's shows were described as a ‚Äúdisgraceful spectacle of padded legs jiggling and wriggling in the insensate follies and indecencies of the hour‚Äù.Moses, Marlie. \\"Lydia Thompson and The ‚ÄòBritish Blondes‚Äô.\\", Women in the American theatre, New York, Crown (1981) Times called their shows ‚Äúan idiotic parody of masculinity‚Äù. Shakespeare scholar Richard Grant White, called burlesque ‚Äúmonstrously incongruous and unnatural‚Äù.Allen, Robert C. \\"Horrible Prettiness: A Cultural Analysis of ‚ÄòBritish Blondes‚Äô.\\", Women in the American Theatre, New York, Crown (1981) The New York Times constantly expressed its disgust of burlesque, even headlining an article with the plea ‚ÄúExit British Burlesque‚Äù. Reflections on the virtue of her dancers by Wilbur F. Storey, the owner of the Chicago Times, led Thompson and her troupe first to post notices calling Storey \\"a liar and a coward\\" and appealing for the sympathy of the people.Hudson, Frederic. Journalism in the United States, from 1690‚Äì1872 Harper & Brothers, 1873, pp. 205‚Äì06 Then, on 24 February 1870, Thompson, her husband and her colleague, Pauline Markham, horsewhipped Storey at gunpoint, for which they were arrested and fined. Thompson told a reporter that Storey \\"had called her by the most odious epithet that could be applied to a woman, and she could stand it no longer. She was glad at what she had done.\\" This resulted in more publicity and popularity for the troupe. Actress Olive Logan protested, \\"I cannot advise any woman to go upon the stage with the demoralizing influence which seems here to prevail more every day, when its greatest rewards are won by brazen-faced, stained, yellow-haired, padded- limbed creatures, while actresses of the old school ‚Äì well trained, decent ‚Äì cannot earn a living.\\" Thompson continued her tour to California and Nevada.Eichin, Carolyn Grattan. From San Francisco Eastward: Victorian Theater in the American West, University of Nevada Press (2020), p. 197 Folly Theatre Thompson, Henderson and her troupe finally returned to England in 1874, and she resumed her starring roles in London and provincial productions, including H. B. Farnie's burlesques of Bluebeard (which she had already made a hit in America) and Robinson Crusoe, and Robert Reece's Carmen, or, Sold for a Song, as well as Piff-Paff (Le Grand Duc de Matapa), Oxygen, The Lady of Lyons, Pluto!, and other burlesques. In her production of Bluebeard, she received a review in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News saying, ‚Äúthe acting of Miss Lydia Thompson not even the most fastidious can find fault. Her chic amuses, her abandon bewitches, her personal charms delight and indeed, in all she does, whether speaking, singing or dancing she exercises over her audiences an influence which is perfectly irresistible, taking by storm the hearts of all who see and hear her.‚Äù The author christens Thompson the savior of the once-dying art form of burlesque, saying, ‚ÄúThe name of Miss Lydia Thompson has acted as a spell and has charmed the apparently dead back to life.‚Äù Henderson purchased the Folly Theatre in 1876, and it became a burlesque house, with Thompson in the lead roles. The first piece was a production of Bluebeard.G√§nzl (2002) In the following years, Thompson returned to America several times, where she remained popular. Thompson separated from Henderson, but the two continued to work together into the 1880s. In 1881, after two years in retirement, she returned to the stage as Mrs Kingfisher in the farce Dust. Thompson returned to New York following the death of Henderson in 1886 and again in the winter seasons of 1888 and 1891. In 1887 she opened at the Royal Strand Theatre, London, under her own management, in Alfred Cellier's comic opera, The Sultan of Mocha. She next starred in the French vaudeville-op√©rette Babette (1888, Antonio), but her voice was judged inadequate. After this, her career began to decline. Her last American performances were in 1894 in The Crust of Society in a supporting role. Back in London, George Edwardes cast her briefly in the Edwardian musical comedy An Artist's Model (1895), but by 1899, she had depleted her funds. A London benefit night was held for her on 2 May 1899 at the Lyceum Theatre, when she performed in The Wedding March by W. S. Gilbert. She also recited a rhymed \\"farewell address\\" written for her by Gilbert.The Pall Mall Gazette, 3 May 1899, p. 6 Her final performances were in 1904, as the Duchesse du Albuquerque in A Queen's Romance.The Daily Mirror obituary, 19 November 1908, p. 4 Thompson died in London at the age of 70.

It was released on November 18, 2008 by Epic Records, and its first single, \\"Do What You Do,\\" began receiving airplay on September 23, 2008. The album debuted and peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, selling 48,000 copies in its first week, and more than 215,000 copies in the United States . == Recording and production == Studio work for the album was put on hold in mid 2007 due to vocalist Chad Gray's and guitarist Greg Tribbett's touring commitments with Hellyeah. At the completion of the Hellyeah tour, Mudvayne reunited and began recording with producer Dave Fortman, who also produced their previous full-length release, Lost and Found. Having completed the tracking of the drums and guitars, as well as the recording of the bass and vocals, the band announced that the mastering stages were scheduled for completion by October 1, 2008. During the recording phase, Fortman revealed to MTV the tentative title The New Game, adding that the band planned to release a second full-length record six months after its release. == Promotion == A video previewing a possible album track was uploaded to Mudvayne's Myspace profile on July 16, 2008. A second video appeared on the profile on August 19 showing Gray tracking vocals. The second video was later made a feature on the band's official website. On September 16, 30-second previews of \\"Fish Out of Water,\\" \\"A New Game\\" and \\"Do What You Do\\" were made available for streaming on the profile. The first single, \\"Do What You Do,\\" first received airplay on September 23. Mudvayne also shot a video for \\"A New Game\\" and released a second single to radio, \\"Scarlet Letters,\\" that was first broadcast on March 9, 2008. A bonus song, \\"Fish Out of Water,\\" was made available for download to customers who pre-ordered The New Game on the iTunes Store, or through Best Buy, and the deluxe digital version of the album also included a digital copy of By the People, for the People. On October 28, 2008, \\"Have it Your Way\\" was released exclusively by Revolver magazine through its website. == Musical and lyrical themes == Fortman said the album should please listeners, but also incorporate a distinct rock and roll sound unheard on previous Mudvayne records. \\"It's heavy and has great hooks, but it also has some moments that are a little more rock 'n' roll that are really cool. It's not anything drastic, but every now and then you'll catch a little hint of old school rock. Also, the tones are a little more earthy sounding and a little warmer than Lost and Found.\\" Singer Chad Gray has stated the album is \\"not light years away from what we've done in the past, but it's not the same.\\" The album's sound has been compared to Alice in Chains and Mot√∂rhead. ==Reception== The album has received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 50% rating on Metacritic,http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-new-game/mudvayne with positive reviews coming from Billboard, which wrote \\"Some of the fierce headbanging that is Mudvayne's stock in trade can still be found in 'The Hate in Me,' 'We the People' and 'Dull Boy,' but the bulk of the record finds the group playing its New Game with hard-hitting exuberance.\\" Another positive review came from the Boston Globe, which wrote, \\"Mudvayne used to be viewed as somewhat of a joke band with its costumes and makeup, but they're more out front and naked now, with markedly more genuine results.\\" James Christopher Monger of Allmusic gave the album a mixed review and wrote \\"The problem is, Mudvayne's own predilection for predictable loud/soft/loud set pieces, forgettable melodies, and over-reliance on words like \\"sorrow,\\" \\"rage,\\" \\"abused,\\" \\"disease,\\" \\"nightmares,\\" and \\"beatings\\" keeps things from ever leaving the tarmac.\\" Another mixed review appeared in Q, which said, \\"This fourth album finds them repeating the nifty trick of simplifying Tool's complex musical equations. Math metal for dummies, anyone?\\" Rolling Stone was also mixed in its response, writing, \\"Mudvayne write some decent guitar hooks (check the title track), but their imagination is parched, with most songs hewing to one formula: riff, whimper, shriek, repeat.\\" Negative reviews came from Sputnikmusic, who wrote that \\"The New Game signifies Mudvayne's transition from elite metal juggernaut to their inevitable fade into obscurity.\\" The Los Angeles Times also panned the album, writing \\"The album's gooey, mid-tempo grind at best evokes System of a Down stripped of ambition and eccentricity, and might elicit sympathy with whatever culprit is running around that no-stoplight town.\\" == Track listing == ;Deluxe edition tracks == Personnel == * Chad Gray ‚àí vocals * Greg Tribbett ‚àí guitars, backing vocals * Ryan Martinie ‚àí bass * Matthew McDonough ‚àí drums * Dave Fortman ‚àí producer, mixing == Chart positions == ;Album { - !Chart (2008) !Peak position - Australian Albums Charts  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"42 - Japanese Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"144 - New Zealand Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"32 - The Billboard 200  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"15 } ;Singles { - !Year !Song !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"US Alt. !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"US Main. !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"US Rock - 2008 \\"Do What You Do\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"13  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"21 - 2009 \\"Scarlet Letters\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"7  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"29 } == References == Category:2008 albums Category:Albums produced by Dave Fortman Category:Epic Records albums Category:Alternative metal albums by American artists Category:Mudvayne albums ","title":"The New Game"},{"id":"19351329","text":"The Dreamers is an unfinished film project directed and produced between 1980 and 1982 by Orson Welles. ==Production history== In 1979, Welles and Oja Kodar, the Croatian actress and writer who was Welles' companion in his later years, collaborated on a screenplay based on two stories from Karen Blixen, The Dreamers and Echoes. Henry Jaglom, the U.S. filmmaker who directed Welles in the 1971 feature A Safe Place, made inquiries to potential investors to back this project, which was originally called Da Capo. Northstar Productions, a company created by filmmaker Hal Ashby, provided Welles with funding to complete the script, but declined to pursue the project after reading the completed script.Brady, Frank. ‚ÄúCitizen Welles,‚Äù 1989. Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons. Welles shot 20 minutes of 35mm footage based on the screenplay, using his Hollywood home as the set for the film.‚ÄúFrom the Beginning: Notes on Orson Welles' Most Personal Late Film,‚Äù Senses of Cinema It remains unclear whether Welles intended the footage to be used strictly as a test reel to pique the interest of potential investors, or whether Welles planned to complete production of the screenplay. Kodar has stated that Welles was prepared to go forward with a full production after the screenplay was rejected by the BBC and Miramax, but cinematographer Gary Graver, who shot the footage, has stated Welles never intended to self-finance the film and would not have gone further on the project without outside financing. ==The footage== The footage for The Dreamers consists of two segments running 10 minutes each. The first segment was shot in black-and-white and involves Welles in costume and make-up as a 19th-century Dutch-Jewish merchant who recounts the story of Pellegrina Leoni, an Italian opera diva who mysteriously disappeared after losing the ability to sing. The second segment was shot in color and features Kodar as Pellegrina, who declares her farewell to her merchant friend while announcing that she is disappearing to seek a new anonymous life. Part of the Kodar footage was shot outdoors in the garden of Welles' home.‚ÄúThe Bootleg Files: The Dreamers,‚Äù Film Threat, September 16, 2005 No other actors appear in the footage. Kodar would later recall Welles toying with the idea of casting Timothy Dalton, Peter Ustinov, Oliver Reed, Bud Cort, and Jeanne Moreau. However, Graver later stated that Welles was planning to use younger and lesser known British actors. ==Aftermath== Welles never acquired financial backing for this project and a full production of The Dreamers never came to fruition. The surviving footage is archived in Germany's Munich Filmmuseum, and it has been made public in several film festivals and retrospectives of Welles' work. Parts of the footage were included in the documentary Orson Welles: The One-Man Band and as a special feature on the Criterion DVD release of Welles' 1973 feature F for Fake. In 1994, Peter Bogdanovich reportedly planned to make The Dreamers, but the production never came about. In 1996, the rights to the Blixen source material was purchased from Kodar by Andy Howard, who was Welles' business manager during the final years of his life. To date, Howard has not brought Welles' concept of The Dreamers to the screen. ==References== Category:1980s unfinished films Category:Films directed by Orson Welles Category:Films based on works by Karen Blixen Category:Films with screenplays by Orson Welles Category:Films with screenplays by Oja Kodar ","title":"The Dreamers (unfinished film)"},{"id":"19351350","text":"Ant√≥nio dos Reis Rodrigues (24 June 1918 - 3 February 2009) was a Portuguese Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. ==Biography== Rodrigues was born in Vila Nova de Our√©m, Portugal and was ordained a priest on 1 March 1947.

Therefore, it flies above the Quirinal Palace, when the President is in residence. The standard is flown from the vehicle transporting the president, from prefectures when the president is visiting a city and inside the halls when he acts in an official capacity. The presidential standard is one of the National symbols of Italy. The standard recalls the colors of the flag of Italy, with particular reference to the standard of the historic Italian Republic of 1802-1805; the square shape and the savoy blue border, whose use was maintained even in the Republican era, symbolize the Italian Armed Forces, which are commanded by the president. ==Description== The President of the Italian Republic has an official standard. The current version is based on the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the emblem of Italy in gold.Stendardo del presidente della Repubblica Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica del 9 ottobre 2000 (GU 241 del 14 ottobre 2000)Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica del 9 ottobre 2000 gazzette.comune.jesi.an.itFoggia ed uso dell'emblema dello Stato Decreto legislativo n. 535 del 5 maggio 1948 (GU 122 del 28 maggio 1948 suppl. ord.) The square shape with a Savoy blue border symbolize the four Italian armed forces, namely the Italian Air Force, the Carabinieri, the Italian Army and the Italian Navy, of which the President is the commander. The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).Lo Stendardo Presidenziale I Corazzieri, Arma dei Carabinieri (retrieved 5 October 2008) ==History== Comparison of Italian and Mexican flags First presidential standard (mod. 1965), in use from 22 September 1965 to 21 March 1990 Flag of the Italian Republic of 1802-1805 The first presidential standard used provisionally since the official proclamation of the Italian Republic (June 18, 1946The 1946 Italian institutional referendum took place on June 2, but the official proclamation of the Republic took place on June 18.) was the national flag; later, on 22 September 1965, it was decided to establish a specific presidential standard. The initial idea of creating, as a standard, the overlapping of the emblem of the Republic with the national flag was immediately discarded because of the similarity of this hypothetical composition with the Mexican flag. With the Order No. 76 dated 22 September 1965 the president Giuseppe Saragat, on the impulse of the defense ministry of Italy, chose the first standard \\"model 1965\\", which included a savoy blue, whose use was maintained even in the Republican era, square flag loaded with the emblem of the Republic, 3 / 5 of the side of the cloth, in gold. The colors, according to the Italian military tradition, symbolize, respectively, the command and the value. In 1986 a standard was established for the deputy president of the Republic. This standard, which is similar to the first standard of the president, instead of blue, is white with a blue frame; moreover, the emblem of the Republic, instead of being gold, is silver. Later, by decree of the President of the Republic of 22 March 1990, the president Francesco Cossiga adopted the second standard \\"1990 model\\", which included a tricolor square drape with a blue border, 1/8 wide (some sources report 1/6) of the side of the drape, and introduced a regulation of use that established its use and exposure in ceremonies and public buildings. This model lasted only two years. In fact, by decree of the President of the Republic of June 29, 1992, the president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro restored the standard \\"model 1965\\", with the emblem of the Republic reduced in size, that is high 1/3 of the side of the drape: this version is known as a third standard \\"model 1992\\". Finally, by decree of the President of the Republic of 9 October 2000, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 241 of 14 October 2000, the president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi introduced the fourth standard \\"2000 model\\", a standard currently in use, which recalls the flag of the historic Italian Republic of 1802-1805. This link with the aforementioned historical standard aims to recall the Risorgimento and the struggle for national unity. The standard currently in use was taken into orbit on board the International Space Station by astronaut Umberto Guidoni and shown during the videoconference with President Ciampi on 25 April 2001. By decree of the President of the Republic of May 17, 2001, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 11 of May 22, 2001, the distinctive standard was created for the presidents emeritus of the Republic. ==Historical evolution of the standard== File:Flag of Italy.svgProvisional Presidential Standard of the Italian Republic (1 January 1948 - 21 September 1965) File:Flag of the President of Italy (1965‚Äì1990).svgFirst standard (mod. 1965) (22 September 1965 - 21 March 1990) File:Flag of the President of Italy (1990‚Äì1992).svgSecond standard (mod. 1990) (22 March 1990 - 28 June 1992) File:Flag of the President of Italy (1992‚Äì2000).svgThird standard (mod. 1992) (29 June 1992 - 13 October 2000) File:Flag of the President of Italy.svgFourth standard (mod. 2000) (14 October 2000 - today) ==See also== *Emblem of Italy *Flag of Italy *List of Italian flags *List of presidents of Italy *National symbols of Italy *President of Italy == Citations Italy Category:National symbols of Italy ","title":"Presidential standard of Italy"},{"id":"19351366","text":"The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is a wholly owned government corporation managed by the Risk Management Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. FCIC manages the federal crop insurance program, which provides U.S. farmers and agricultural entities with crop insurance protection. Corn crops bordering the Wabash River ==Background== During the 1930s, farmers thought they were safe during the Great Depression because they could provide food for themselves. That changed quickly when the Dust Bowl drought made it difficult for farmers to produce any crops during this time. By not being able to produce these essential crops, they lacked necessary food for themselves and were unable to make money off of the crops. In order to help America recover from the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt started the New Deal, which was a plan compiled of federal programs, including several focused on farming. ==History== The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation was a program created to carry out the government initiative to provide insurance for farmers' produce, which means that farmers would receive compensation for crops, even if they were not sustained in that year. On September 26, 1980, the program was expanded through Public Law 96-365.Crop Insurance (10.450), Federal Grants Wire. Initially, participation in FCIC was voluntary. However, insurance premiums were subsidized by the U.S. government as a means of encouraging participation in the FCIC program. This changed with the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which required farmers to participate in the program in order to be eligible for deficiency payments related to certain FCIC programs. During the mandatory participation Catastrophic coverage was created. \\"Catastrophic coverage compensated farmers for losses exceeding 50 percent of an average yield paid at 60 percent of the price established for the crop for that year.\\" Mandatory participation was repealed in 1996, but for the farmers who had accepted other benefits it was mandatory to obtain crop insurance, or they would surrender the eligibility for any benefits that were caused by disaster.History of the Crop Insurance Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture. An independent office designed to supervise and monitor FCIC activities was mandated in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L.104-127).

The rank holder should be addressed as Your High Well Born (, Vashe Vysokoblagorodie). ==History of the rank== In 1717, Peter I started to reform the executive institutions. The Collegiums appeared, in which Collegiate Councillor was one of the posts. On 24 January 1722, the Table of Ranks was introduced as a law which regulated employment in the civil service. This law contained the list of new ranks split into 14 classes. The Collegiate Councillor rank was attributed to the 6th class. According to the Table of Ranks, both civil and military ranks were assigned to a person for seniority and/or providing extraordinary services. The people who received a rank of the 6th class were classified as the highest nobility (hereditary), regardless of their origins. Elizabeth Petrovna, the Empress of Russia, by her decree from 23 June 1745, made it obligatory that a person only be promoted to the 6th class from the 7th one (before it had been possible to \\"skip\\" the 7th class and to be promoted from the 8th one). The rank was abolished in 1917 by the Soviet decree on estates and civil ranks. ==Possible career paths for Collegiate Councilors== As the bureaucracy in the Russian Empire was developing, a Collegiate councillor could serve as a chief of a department, a prosecutor, a chief secretary of the Senate. A marshal of nobility could become a collegiate councillor after three years of service. The changes in services of rank-holders from the 6th class were executed by the \\"highest orders\\". According to the law \\"About the enrollment of the ranks in civil service\\", issued on 9 December 1856, it was acknowledged that the quality of service is dependent not only on education exclusively, but also on experience and competence. The time of service required of the officials of the 6th class before the next promotion was increased to five years (from four years) in 1898. In 1857, the number of the officials in the 6th class was 2216 (compared to 541 in 1796). ==Requirements== The list of requirements for a person to be eligible for a service in the 6th class included: * Russian citizenship * Male * No criminal records * Completed service in the Army * University level of education; and/or * Nobility (personal or hereditary) == References == { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\\" - width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"Junior rank Court Councillor width=\\"40%\\" align=\\"center\\"Table of Ranks Collegiate Councillor width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"Senior rank State Councillor } Category:Titles in Russia ","title":"Collegiate Councillor"},{"id":"19351434","text":"Milburn James Shoffner (November 13, 1905 ‚Äì January 19, 1978) was a Major League Baseball pitcher.

In 1930 and 1931, his ERA was over 7.00, and by mid-season he was pitching for the Toledo Mud Hens. Shoffner did not return to the major leagues until 1937, with the Boston Bees.

That performance led to a larger role on the 1938 team, and while his performance slipped a bit, his record was a respectable 8‚Äì7 with a 3.54 ERA. Despite getting off to a good start in 1939, Shoffner was waived by the Bees and claimed by the Cincinnati Reds. Overall that season, Shoffner finished 6th in the league in ERA at 3.18 in 170 innings (a career high). Despite this, he did not appear in the 1939 World Series for the Reds. The following season, Shoffner had a rougher go, as his ERA slipped back to 5.63 and he was mostly limited to mop-up duty. Once again, he did not appear in the 1940 World Series, which the Reds won. During the offseason, Shoffner was traded to the New York Giants for infielder Wayne Ambler, and after pitching one last season in the minors he retired. Following his playing days, Shoffner worked as a minor league baseball umpire in the late 1940s and as a bar owner in the early 1950s.

Holler House was opened in the Lincoln Village neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1908. The 100th anniversary party was held on Saturday, September 14, 2008. Esquire has rated Holler House one of the best bars in America. ==History== Holler House was founded on September 13, 1908, by \\"Iron Mike\\" Skoronski as Skowronski's.McClelland (2008), p. 28. His son, Gene, married Marcy in 1952 and they renamed it Gene and Marcy's. Gene died, but Marcy Skowronski still runs the tavern. About 1975, it was called \\"Holler House\\" by a German woman who could not believe the noise that was coming from inside. ==Tradition== Pinboys at Holler House bowling alley Starting in the mid-twentieth century, Holler House began a tradition that has since accumulated nearly 1,000 bras. This tradition started when the owner Marcy Skowronski was drinking with her friends, after which they started taking their clothes off. This has now grown into a tradition in which women autograph and hang their bras from various fixtures in the tavern on their first visit. When the bras started fraying, Skowronski boxed up most of them to make room for new ones to be displayed. ==100th anniversary== In preparation for its 100th anniversary, Holler House received its first thorough cleaning in 40 years. During this cleaning, five two-hole 15-pound wooden bowling balls were found. ==Same appearance as one century ago== Holler House still looks much the same as it did a century ago. The lanes are made of real wood that was laid over a century ago, not the synthetic wood found in modern bowling alleys. It still has a manual pin-spotting mechanism on each lane, that pin boys return the bowlers' balls by rolling them down a traditional \\"overlane\\" return-track between the two lanes. Scores from bowling games are documented from paper hanging on the wall. ==Memorabilia and the beer sold== Memorabilia dating back to as early as 1912 is displayed. Prices in the early days were 25 cents for a hot beef sandwich and 25 cents plus deposit for a half-gallon of beer. During Prohibition, liquor was stored under a baby's crib on the assumption the police would not look there. There are no chairs in the bowling. Reflecting the ethnic background of the neighborhood, there are Polish eagle crests above the bowling lanes. Holler House sells only bottled beer, with the exception of Schlitz in a can.

The program starred Lucille Ball, Anthony Newley and the Dave Clark Five and was filmed entirely on location in London. ==Plot== Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Ball), arrives in London to claim a free day trip that she won in a jingle contest. She is expecting a luxury limousine tour of the city, but instead is greeted by a tour guide named Tony (Anthony Newley) who escorts her in a motorcycle with an open sidecar. Their initial stop, for punting on the River Thames in an inflatable raft, ends disastrously when they collide with a rowing team and sink beneath the waters. Tony then takes Lucy to the heart of London's shopping district, where she models the latest mod fashions in a musical number based on the Phil Spector tune \\"Lucy in London\\". Lucy is then escorted to Madame Tussaud‚Äôs wax museum, where she is frightened by a curator (Wilfred Hyde-White) whom she mistakes for a haunted wax statue that comes to life. She then visits a British manor, where she plays Kate opposite actor Peter Wyngarde in a scene from the William Shakespeare comedy The Taming of the Shrew. Lucy and Tony return to the Thames, where they sing Pop Goes the Weasel as a duet. The Dave Clark Five turns up to sing London Bridge is Falling Down. Lucy and Tony then arrive at an empty theater, where Tony dons a tuxedo and sings a medley of songs from the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley show Stop the World - I Want to Get Off. Lucy follows him with a mime act and a song where she shows her appreciation of her London adventures. ==Production history== Lucy in London came about as part of Lucille Ball's 1966-67 contract renewal with CBS. At the time, she was producing and starring in The Lucy Show for the network. The agreement gave her the option to star in three specials that would be produced independent of her weekly program. Ball originally planned a production where she would co-star with Mitzi Gaynor as two nuns touring Europe, followed by a French-based production called Lucy in Paris and a Middle Eastern comedy called Lucy in Arabia. None of those projects gained footing, and instead Ball, through her company Desilu Productions, opted to shoot Lucy in London.Sanders, Coyne Steven, and Gilbert, Tom. ‚ÄúDesilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz,‚Äù 1994. Harper Paperbacks. The concept for Lucy in London was set up in an episode of The Lucy Show called \\"Lucy Flies to London\\". Much of that episode, which involved Lucy‚Äôs unfamiliarity with air travel, was based on an unsold pilot written and shot in 1960.Fidelman, Geoffrey Mark. ‚ÄúThe Lucy Book: A Complete Guide to Her Five Decades on Television,‚Äù 1999. Renaissance Books. However Lucy In London itself was not explicit in its connection to The Lucy Show. Subtle references were made to The Lucy Show including her winning the jingle contest but explicit references like Lucy's surname Carmichael and that her boss is Mr Mooney were avoided. It seemed that Lucy In London was written this way to accommodate viewers who may not have been watching The Lucy Show at all. In fact Lucy In London was promoted as a special in its own right but not as part of The Lucy Show. Laurence Olivier was signed to appear in Lucy in London, but withdrew from the production prior to shooting. Ball went through 15 different wigs during the production. Cleo Smith, Ball's cousin and the executive in charge of this production, later recalled that problems arose in photographing the star on the London locations, where the use of heavy stage make-up and filtered lighting that was employed for her studio-based program could not be repeated. Ball's biographer Geoffrey Mark Fidelman would later remark that the actress \\"looked old\\" throughout the show due to difficulties in establishing flattering lighting for the outdoor sequences. Lucy in London was broadcast on October 24, 1966. Viewership was high for the special (finishing as the most- watched telecast of the week) but critical responses were very poor, with Variety complaining: \\"What had promised to be one of the season's major specials turned out to be a major disappointment.\\" Ball opted not to pursue the creation of the remaining two specials in her contract. (Ball did co-star in one other special earlier in 1966, Carol + 2, which starred Carol Burnett, had a much better reception and would be re-aired in 1967 to fill one of the spots of the two unproduced specials.) Additionally, Ball had starred in a special in 1965, The Lucille Ball Comedy Hour with Bob Hope (that is not to be confused with her similarly-titled series of television specials with the cast of her prior show), although that special was not part of the contract that gave way to this production. Lucy in London is included on the DVD release of The Lucy Show - The Official 5th Season. ==References External links == * Category:CBS television specials Category:1966 television specials Category:1960s American variety television series Category:Television programs directed by Steve Binder Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Films with screenplays by Ron Friedman ","title":"Lucy in London"},{"id":"19351501","text":"Cornelius Elanjikal D.D.

On September 16, 2008, on the orders of President Nicolas Sarkozy, French special forces raided and recovered the yacht, rescued the two hostages, killed one pirate, and captured the other six. The pirates were flown to France to stand trial for piracy and related offenses; ultimately, five of them were convicted and sentenced to four to eight years in prison, while a sixth was acquitted. The incident marked the second French counter-piracy commando operation of 2008 (after the recovery of the MY Le Ponant), as well as the first-ever French trial of Somali pirates. ==Background== Map showing the extent of Somali pirate attacks on shipping vessels between 2005 and 2010. From 2003 to 2007, the number of piracy incidents worldwide declined from 452 to 282; however, piracy increased by 100% in Somalia, which suffered from severe poverty and lacked an effective central government since the 1991 ouster of Siad Barre. By 2005, the International Maritime Bureau advised ships to stay 200 nautical miles off the Somali coast. According to academics J. Ndumbe Anyu and Samuel Moki, \\"the overwhelming majority of pirates in Somalia come from Puntland, a semi- autonomous region in the northeast of the country... where [Somalia's] poorest of the poor live.\\" By 2008, as Anyu and Moki write, Somalia was the \\"epicenter of piracy,\\" with 100 ships attacked that year; pirate ransom demands had spiked \\"from tens of thousands of dollars a few years before to between $500,000 and $3.5 million,\\" since shipowners were willing to pay relatively small amounts to recover much more expensive ships. Pirates extorted about $120 million in ransoms in 2008. Accordingly, insurance premiums for shipping in the Gulf of Aden increased ten times from 2007 to 2008, from $900 to $9,000. The pirates frequently targeted yachts or commercial ships, which are unarmed and may hold valuable cargo. They sometimes targeted ships bearing humanitarian aid, such as the MV Semlow and MV Miltzow in 2005, which were hijacked while delivering food to Somalia under the UN World Food Programme. Despite international naval patrols working to curb piracy, The Telegraph noted that the region remained \\"the most dangerous in the world for pirate attacks,\\" with 24 attacks between April and June 2008. In addition, 94 mariners were captured in the Gulf of Aden in the first half of the year. On April 4, 2008, pirates seized the yacht MY Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden, capturing 30 crew members. The craft was then moored near Eyl in Puntland, and the owners paid a $2.15 million ransom for the captured crew; the hostages were released unharmed after a week of captivity. The French military captured six suspected pirates and part of the ransom in an April 11 helicopter assault on Jariban, sending the suspects back to France for trial. Four of the suspects were later convicted of piracy, while the other two were acquitted. Another pirate attack in the Gulf of Aden occurred 12 days before the assault on the Carr√© d'As IV, when the Iranian-owned cargo ship MV Iran Deyanat was hijacked on August 21 by 40 pirates and held for 50 days; the ship and its 25 crew were released in November after the IRISL Group allegedly paid $2.5 million in ransom. ==Pirate hijacking and recovery== British Royal Marines investigate two suspected pirate skiffs in the Gulf of Aden. On September 2, 2008, the , twin-masted yacht Carr√© d'As IV, which had been sailing from Australia to La Rochelle, France, was attacked and captured by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden, where 12 ships had been hijacked since July. The pirates, later identified as Ahmed Mahmoud Ahmoud, Sheik Nur Jama Mohamud, Mohamed Hassan Yacub, Abdirahman Farah Awil, Abdulahi Ahmed Guelleh, Ahmed Mohamed Yusuf, and a seventh man, attacked in two speedboats, armed with (defective) rocket launchers, three assault rifles, and ammunition. The yacht's two crew, 60-year old Tahiti residents Jean-Yves and Bernadette Delanne, were taken and held for a ransom of $1‚Äì2 million; the pirates also demanded the release of the six pirates captured by the French in April. The Delannes, who were seasoned sailors, later recalled that their captors were seasick, unprepared amateurs, and called them \\"kids out of their depth.\\" The pirates stole various valuables on board, including $1,000 in cash, $900 worth of traveler's checks, a digital camera, and jewelry. The pirates reportedly then set course for Eyl. Eyl official Abdullahi Saed Yusuf said that \\"We are powerless to help,\\" while a French military spokesman announced that the French Navy and base at Djibouti were \\"on standby, ready to intervene.\\" A contradictory report from the East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme stated that the Delannes had been moved to a pirate base in the Xaabo mountains, and that the pirates were using the Carr√© d'As IV as a \\"decoy vessel\\" to attract more victim ships. The couple's daughter, Alizee, claimed on Tahitian radio that she had spoken with her parents on a satellite phone, and that they were \\"fine\\". According to another press account, a feud developed between Yacub and the pirates' sponsor, \\"Shire,\\" a Puntland organized crime figure who belonged to a different clan; on September 12, Yacub sailed for Eyl, prompting a overland pursuit by Shire's men that ended at Ras Hafun. On September 15, French President Nicolas Sarkozy ordered a raid when he learned that the pirates were absconding to Eyl. The same night, 30 French Commandos Marine parachuted in and stormed the Carr√© d'As IV while it was in Somali territorial waters, killing one of the pirates and capturing the six others in under ten minutes. Malaysia and Germany lent support to the mission, the latter contributing two reconnaissance planes. The Delannes were safely rescued, brought aboard the French Courbet, and taken to Djibouti; after being held for a week, the pirates were flown to Paris, France for trial. ==Aftermath and trial== In a news conference after the rescue operation, Sarkozy called the raid a \\"warning\\" to pirates, declaring that \\"'France will not allow crime to pay... This operation is a warning to all those who indulge in this criminal activity. This is a call for the mobilization of the international community.'\\" He also endorsed the creation of a \\"marine police\\" unit to ensure security, and further \\"punitive action\\" against pirates. A Puntland official supported the French move, urging further international involvement to quell piracy. In November 2011, after being detained for over three years, the six accused pirates, ranging from the ages of 21 to 36, were charged with \\"hijacking, kidnapping and armed robbery\\" in France's first-ever trial of Somali pirates. France was the fifth European country to try accused Somali pirates, after Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Since Yusuf was below the age of 18 at the time of the hijacking, the trial was held in camera, with an interpreter to assist the defendants. The Delannes, who testified at the trial, described Yusuf as serving as the cook and Shire's representative, Awil as the sailor, Yacub as an interpreter, Ahmoud as a \\"warrior,\\" and Guelleh as the fisherman responsible for feeding the pirate and captives. Sarkozy's speech was also entered into the trial as evidence. Psychiatrist Jean-Claude Archambault examined the defendants and concluded that Mohamud had developed a mental illness during imprisonment. The prosecution argued that the Somalis, who described themselves as \\"simple fishermen,\\" were \\"dangerous terrorists.\\" Prosecutor Anne Obez-Vosgien requested 14‚Äì16 year sentences for Mohamud, Awil, and Ahmoud, a 13‚Äì15 year sentence for Yacub, eight years for Yusuf, and six years for Guelleh. The lawyers for the accused took the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), saying their arrest and transfer was illegal; they also argued that the alleged pirates on trial were scapegoats for \\"the main culprits\\". According to Le Monde diplomatique, \\"the trial revealed that they were just following the orders of a powerful local man [Shire], who was identified but never investigated.\\" On November 30, after a 15-day trial, five of the accused received sentences between four and eight years, while the 36-year-old Guelleh was acquitted and released. The defendants apologized to the Delannes, who kissed them and wished them \\"a new and happy life\\".

The prototype was designated the Lat√©co√®re 14, reusing the number of an unrelated earlier design that had been rejected. This new aircraft was a parasol wing monoplane of conventional configuration with an enclosed cabin for four passengers and an open cockpit for the pilot. This was Lat√©co√®re's first commercially successful design and as production continued, three different engines were fitted. ==Design and development== The Lat√©co√®re 14's parasol wing was rectangular in plan and built around a pair of metal girder spars and with wooden ribs. It was fabric covered except in the centre which was covered with sheet metal and contained the fuel tank and a post box. The trailing edge had a large cut-out over the pilot's open cockpit to increase the upward field of view. On each side the wing was braced by a pair parallel of struts from the spars to the base of the fuselage, assisted about halfway out by a lighter, vertical strut pair and a third pair to the upper fuselage. Its centre section was attached to the fuselage by a fore and aft pair of inverted V-cabane struts. It was fitted with a Renault 12 Fe water-cooled V12 engine with a vertical exhaust and a transverse radiator under the nose. The fuselage had a curved-section, with a metal structure and either plywood or metal covering (there are conflicting reports) forwards from the rear of the cabin and wooden structure with fabric covering aft. The cabin started aft of the cockpit, had three windows on each side and accommodated four passengers who entered by an oval port-side door. The empennage was conventional with metal structures and fabric covering. Its cantilever tailplane, mounted high on the fuselage, was rectangular in plan as were the elevators. The fin and balanced rudder had a triangular profile, with a vertical trailing edge. The Lat√©co√®re 14 had conventional, fixed landing gear with mainwheels on a streamlined single axle, fitted with rubber cord shock absorbers. Its ends were mounted to the lower fuselage with a V-strut on either side, cross braced with steel wires. Probably two type 14s were built. It was first flown, by Enderlin, in 1924. In December 1924 the second prototype appeared at the Paris Salon, already re- identified as the Lat√©co√®re 17. Tests had shown that it could only carry a disappointing commercial load of . The 17-1R (R for Renault engine) was a structural redesign and rebuild of the first type 14 that increased the load by . There was a new wing with semi-elliptical tips which reduced wing are by ; the deep cut-out was filled in, recovering some wing area. Seven were built, including two prototypes. During the production run, the fuselage covering was replaced with a longitudinally corrugated dural skin from the behind engine to the rear of the cabin. The earlier single port-side door was replaced by two on the starboard side and there were also two long, top-hinged doors on that side, one above the other, accessing freight and baggage space under the cockpit. These examples were designated 17-3R, of which seven were new-built and two more modified from 17-1Rs. There were also variants powered by Gnome- Rh√¥ne 9A engines, a nine-cylinder radial, housed under an ovoid cowling with its cylinder heads projecting for cooling. One 17-1J, equivalent to the 17-1R, was built and was later modified to 17-3J standard, together with five new examples. ==Operational history== Lignes A√©riennes Lat√©co√®re, operating as Compagnie g√©n√©rale d'entreprises a√©ronautiques (CGEA) flew at least fifteen of these aircraft and used several of them on its routes between France and Morocco. Eight were used for services to South America and two on a temporary domestic route between Perpignan, Marseille, and Toulouse. After the sale of CGEA in 1928 they were operated by Aeropostale. ==Variants== Data from Cuny (1992), p.62 ;Lat√©co√®re 14: Prototype with Renault 12Fe engine.

Jones was the second son of Edward Jones and his wife Mary Powell, daughter of Robert Powell of Whittington Park. He was educated at Shrewsbury School before being admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 9 May 1629. On 6 May of the same year he became a student of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar on 17 March 1634, two years after finishing his Bachelor of Arts degree. His career began in Shrewsbury, where he was elected Alderman in 1638.History of Parliament Online - Jones, Thomas During the English Civil War Shrewsbury was a Royalist garrison and Prince Rupert stayed at Jones's house. Jones was taken prisoner when the town was captured by the Parliamentarians in February 1645, the commissioners for corporations later stated that \\"he had declared himself against the commission of array\\" and \\"refused to find a dragoon for the King‚Äôs service\\". In 1660, Jones was elected Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in the 1660 Convention parliament, together with his cousin Samuel. The day following the election he became town clerk for Shrewsbury and served until 1662. Also in 1660, he was made a Bencher at Lincoln's Inn. He was re-elected MP for Shrewsbury in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament. During this time he was inactive in Westminster, and instead furthered his legal career in Wales and the Marches. Between 1662 and 1670 he served on Eyre circuits of Northern Wales, and in 1669 he was made a Serjeant-at-law. In 1671 he was made Chief Justice of the North Wales circuit. The same year he was promoted to King's Serjeant and knighted on 26 October. On 13 April 1676, Jones was rewarded for his service in Parliament by being made a justice of the King's Bench. In 1678, as one of the Popish plot judges, he drove hard for the conviction of Edward Coleman, but later clearly indicated his belief in Samuel Pepys' innocence. In 1680, the House of Commons attempted to have him impeached, but the start of the second Exclusion Parliament prevented this. In 1681 and 1683 he helped try the conspirators in the Popish Plot, and appears to have initially believed Titus Oates and other informers before changing his mind.Kenyon J.P. The Popish Plot William Heinemann 1972 Jones was the judge in the 1683 Quo warranto trial against the Corporation of London, and was rewarded on 29 September 1683 by succeeding Francis Pemberton as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He was one of the judges appointed to the Court of Claims prior to the coronation of James II in 1684. Although he continued to display severity when handing out judgements in subsequent trials, he eventually found himself unable to follow the King's wishes, and along with three other judges was dismissed on 21 April 1686; he was appointed due to his severity and then removed, ironically, because he was not severe enough.D.

He returned home to Carreghofa, Montgomeryshire, where he died on 31 May 1692 aged 77.

The first class of seniors graduated in 1894 just four years after the founding of Middlesboro in 1890. There is very little historical information remaining concerning Middlesboro's early educational institutes. In his 1943 book, \\"The History of Bell County\\" Henry Harvey Fuson (transcribed by C. Richard Mathews) offers some insight into those early years. He writes: \\"The first school in Middlesborough was a private school taught by Ezra L. Grubb, a graduate of Centre College. It was opened December 9, 1889, over Charles Whitaker's store on East Cumberland Avenue. Mr. Grubb was assisted by Mrs. Maggie Chumley and Miss Cora Morris, who taught music and painting.\\" \\"On October 17, 1890, the city council passed an ordinance to establish a public school. Mr. Grubb became the first principal, being succeeded by Prof. T. C. Westfall. Following Westfall as principal was C. W. Gordinier from Valparaiso Normal School, who was appointed by the first city board of education. The members of the board were F. D. Hart, W. H. Rhorer, William Acuff, E. K. Pattee, M. Park and Mr. Price. Mr. Hart was elected secretary and manager of the school at fifteen dollars per month.\\" Fuson further states: \\"The first class was graduated in 1894, the members being: John Miller, Jennie Dickinson, Julia Moore, Kate Colgan, Louise Park, Mary Campbell, Denta Campbell, Nell Van Gorder, Jess Rhorer, Dora Green, W. A. Purnell and Hattie Broshear.\\" Classes moved to Middlesboro High School (Central) after completion of the new building in 1910.\\" The first school that opened its doors in 1890 as Middlesborough Public School was likely located on the lower floor of what is now the Masonic Lodge building on 20th Street. Early photographs of the building show a sign that reads \\"Public School\\". The Middlesboro school system offices remained in the lower floor rooms until the 1970s. Dr. Charles H. Gordinier came to Middlesboro and served as principal of its fledgling school system beginning in 1892. His major accomplishment was grading the schools. Dr. Gordinier served as principal teacher from 1892 to 1894 and again in 1895. Dr. Charles H. Gordinier, Middlesboro's First School Superintendent Major Campbell was hired as principal teacher for the 1894‚Äì95 school year; however, Dr. Gordinier was rehired the following year to replace Campbell. First Superintendent, Dr. Gordinier Dr. Gordinier was named the very first official superintendent of schools in 1896. According to an article in the August 10, 1967 edition of the Middlesboro Daily News, it was during the same time period that a separate high school was formed. The first principal teacher was Professor Burke H. Kenney. Very little is known of Professor Kenney. After he was replaced as superintendent in 1896, Dr. Gordinier, founded the Middlesboro University School, or Middlesboro Collegiate Institute, under the direction of Central College. Central College was created after the Presbyterian Church of Kentucky, and with it Centre College, split in 1867. The \\"community college\\" lasted for only a short time; however, reports indicate it was professional and a considerable asset to the community and its students. According to the 1967 Daily News article earlier referenced, the first graduate names were listed in the cornerstone of the Central School with Dr. Gordinier named as superintendent. The Middlesboro University School continued for a short time after the departure of Dr. Gordinier. Professor James Reid Sterrett of Lexington, Virginia Cadet Sterrett in 1891 served as principal. Reid would serve until his departure to the Augusta Independent School in Augusta, Kentucky in 1901. Dr. Gordinier later returned to Pennsylvania around 1900 and had a long career in education. He was president of Millersville University from 1918 until 1929 and stayed in the education field well into his 70s. Professor S.L. Frogge Middlesboro's second official school superintendent was Professor Samuel Littleberry Frogge who replaced Dr. Gordinier. He was hired for the 1897‚Äì98 school year and ended his time at Middlesboro in 1900. S.L Frogge, circa 1900 A native of Russellville, Kentucky, professor Frogge was an 1876 Graduate of Bethel College. His contributions to education in Kentucky were numerous. Professor Frogge served as superintendent for a number of Kentucky school districts. He was President of the State Teachers Reading Association at the time of his death in 1907. J.B. Taylor J.B. Taylor served the school system as superintendent from about 1900 until 1902. Superintendent J.B. Taylor A report in Kentucky Public Documents written in 1902 describes the system under Taylor: \\"The public schools of Middlesboro were organized in 1891, and have graduated classes every year, except one; that was 1895. The high school course is the equal of that of any other city in the State of Kentucky of twice its size, being planned after the suggestions of the Committees of Ten and Fifteen. The enrollment for 1900 and 1901 was thirty- six; for 1901 and 1902, twenty six as follows: Four seniors, twelve sophomores, and ten freshmen. The class of work done this year is superior to that of last year. Penmanship and music under the direction of a special teacher have been added to all the grades and the high school this year. The enrollment last year was five hundred; this year five hundred seventy five.\\" Dr. Oliver Winfrey Another of the early Middlesboro School superintendents was Professor M. Oliver (M.O.) Winfrey. Winfrey excelled in many endeavors having at one time run for Kentucky State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Professor Winfrey received his MA degree from Kentucky University and his LLD from Georgetown University in Washington D.C. According to \\"A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians\\" by E. Polk Johnson, Winfrey was superintendent from September 1902 until September 1915. He was credited with the building of Middlesborough Central High School in 1906. Dr. Winfrey was well known throughout the South as one of the region's leading advocates for higher education. The Winfrey Scandal Dr. Winfrey's time in Middlesboro ended in 1915 when he was accused of a criminal operation (illegal abortion) and breach of promise with a former teacher in the district. The allegations filed by Miss Nannie Louise Lynn of Virginia were vehemently denied by Winfrey as blackmail, yet he was indicted. The news of his actions were reported by several state newspapers including a report in The Adair County News of June 9, 1915. The court case, denial of the events, and his subsequent marriage to the young woman, ended Dr. Winfrey's long career in public service and the education field. The Hopkinsville Kentuckian of June 5, 1915 gives a full report of the incident. The description of the events borders on the bizarre. Miss Lynn stated in the accusation that Winfrey had persuaded her that they had been married during the illegal operation. Dr. Winfrey died six years later at age 49. His estranged wife Anna whom he had married in 1897, indicated in a 1921 City Directory entry from Louisville, Kentucky that she was the widow of M.O. Winfrey. Mrs. Winfrey reported in other documents obtained by a newspaper that she had divorced Winfrey a few years earlier. Francis Albert Cosgrove Francis Albert F.A. Cosgrove served as superintendent from September 1915 until 1917. He was active in statewide education projects. He served as superintendent in other systems including Jackson City schools in Breathitt County during the 1920s. Dr. Tybee William Oliver Dr. T.W. Oliver, 1921Middlesboro High School was listed as a Class A accredited High School as early as 1920 under the direction of superintendent Doctor Tybee William (T.W.) Oliver. Dr. Oliver served as superintendent from 1917 until 1922. Dr. Oliver was born at Sturgis, Kentucky in 1881. After leaving Middlesboro, he was named superintendent of the Pike County Kentucky school system. In the publication, Catalog of the University of Kentucky 1920‚Äì21, Middlesboro Schools are listed as Class A Accredited Public High School under the leadership of Dr. Oliver. Dr. J.W. Bradner Dr. James Wood J.W. Bradner, 1924 One of Middlesboro's most distinguished school superintendents was Dr. James Wood (J.W.) Bradner. A graduate of Tri- State College (BS); Indiana University (AB); Columbia University (MA); and graduate studies at Chicago University, Dr. Bradner was a nationally respected educator and administrator. Under his leadership at Middlesboro beginning in the Fall of 1921, the school system was considered the top district in the state. The distinguished Bradner was selected by the Governor of Kentucky to head the Kentucky Department of Education. Dr. Bradner served the school system and community until his sudden death in 1944. As a result of Bradner's devotion and service to Middlesborough public schools, the football stadium located in downtown is named in his honor. ==Buildings== Middlesboro High (Central) School, on 20th Street, was completed in 1906. The large brick building housed both the high school and classrooms for downtown area elementary students. With the rapid growth of the city, a separate high school was built in 1920 located one block west of Central School just off South 21st Street. MHS 1936 Middlesboro High School received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. in 1929. The classically designed school was located atop a small knoll overlooking downtown Middlesboro for nearly 50 years. Having played an integral role in thousands of students lives, the aging Central School and the old Middlesboro High School were demolished in the late 1960s after two new racially integrated elementary schools were built in 1965 and a new high school in 1967‚Äì68. The city parking lot and Middlesboro's city hall now stand on the old school sites. Students on parade for a new school in 1965 After several years of agitation by students, and planning by school officials, everyone got their wish when the present Middlesboro High School was constructed in the West end of the city at 4404 West Cumberland Avenue. Completed in the Fall of 1968, the state of the art building was one of the finest in the state at the time of its construction. Present day classes are held in the same building as MHS continues its long tradition of providing students with a quality education. The senior class of 1996 unveiled a framed banner marking 100 years of excellence at Middlesboro High School during the graduation ceremony which is on permanent display in the Central Arts Building. ==School song== Middlesboro High School's official fight song was sung at least as far back as March 18, 1915. The Pinnacle News ran a story entitled \\"St. Patrick's Day at Local Schools\\". An excerpt from the article reads, \\"A quartette of girls sang \\" A Toast To Dear Old Erin\\" in more than an ordinary manner. Then the entire school gave the Middlesboro Loyalty Song with great gusto.\\" Loyalty lyrics appeared in print for the first time in the 1921 edition of the MHS Senior Yearbook. Middlesboro Loyalty is performed by the award winning marching band at football and basketball games, parades and at other times when maximum school spirit is required! The music and lyrics are nearly identical to the University of Illinois school song \\"Illinois Loyalty\\". However, Middlesboro Loyalty is played at much faster, more rousing tempo. The words are: We're loyal to you, Middlesboro! We're yellow and white, Middlesboro! We'll back you to stand 'Gainst the best in the land, For we know you have sand, Middlesboro, Rah! Rah! So crack out that ball, Middlesboro! We're backing you all, Middlesboro! Our team is our Fame Protector, On, boys, for we expect a Victory from you, Middlesboro! Che-Hee! Cha-Hah! Cha-Hah! Hah! Hah! Middlesboro High School, Rah! Rah! Rah! Fling out that dear ol' flag of yellow and white, Lean on thy sons and daughters, Fighting for right. Like men of Auld Lang Syne: Shouting defiance, Placing reliance, Os-ke-wah-wah-wah! Amid the broad green fields that nourish our land, For honest labor and for learning we stand, And unto thee we pledge our hearts and hands, Dear ol' Alma Mater- Middlesboro! ==Campus== Middlesboro High School shares its campus with Middlesboro Middle School. The two schools are separated by the Central Arts Building which provide students with a 900 seat auditorium, a state-of-the-art sound and lighting booth, a visual arts hallway for both middle school and high school art classes, and a performing arts hallway for choir, theater, and instrumental music programs. The facility also contains an Athletic Hall of Fame area in the main lobby. The Central Arts building is used for both school and community events. It is primarily used for theater productions, choir and band concerts, and graduation. ==Arches of Roses== A once long lost tradition at Middlesboro High School was \\"Arches of Roses.\\" Unlike most schools whose graduates march to \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" before the graduation ceremony, MHS chose the song \\"Arches of Roses.\\" Junior girls, dressed in long formal gowns and silky white gloves, carried arches wrapped in gold and white ribbon covered with roses down the aisles leading the Senior class into the auditorium. This unique tradition has been with MHS since its beginning but had been abandoned in recent graduation ceremonies. However, in 2007, \\"Arches of Roses\\" was performed by a group of Seniors to bring the tradition back to Middlesboro High School, and in 2013, \\"Arches of Roses\\" once again became an integral part of the graduation ceremonies at MHS. ==Extracurricular activities== Middlesboro High School students have the opportunity to participate in academic team, The \\"Pride of the Cumberlands\\" Yellow Jacket Band, Beta Club, choir, DECA, drama, FBLA, FCCLA, First Priority, journalism, yearbook staff, newspaper, JROTC, Key Club, National Honor Society, Spanish club, student government, Technology Student Association, Teens Against Tobacco Use, HOSA and VICA. In December 2012, it was announced that the \\"Pride of the Cumberlands\\" was selected outright to represent the state of Kentucky during a halftime show performance at the 2013 Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida the following month. The last time the band was selected to perform at an event of this magnitude was in 1988 at the Orange Bowl. ==Athletics== Middlesboro High School's athletic teams are known as the Yellow Jackets, or Lady Jackets for the girls' teams, and are well known around the state as an athletic powerhouse in many sports. Competition includes football, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, fast pitch softball, tennis, track and volleyball. The MHS girls 2005 softball team won the first ever All \\"A\\" State Softball Tournament in Kentucky. The school is also known for repeated appearances by boys and girls in the All \\"A\\" Classic State Basketball Tournament. Middlesboro High School won the 1998 Kentucky Class A State Football Championship game. The team defeated Mayfield High School with a score of 27-6. Dustin Wynn, a former kicker for the MHS football team, set the Kentucky High School Athletic Association's state record for the longest field goal attempt at 57 yards during a game at Harlan High School. The kick was successful, and the record has yet to be broken. The Middlesboro Yellow Jackets football program is one of the top fifteen winningest programs in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The team also holds numerous records in other areas of its football program and is one of the most respected high school football programs in Kentucky. Middlesboro High School also excels on the baseball diamond. Under former coach Bill Powell, the baseball Yellow Jackets grew to become a state powerhouse and is one of the winningest programs in KHSAA history. Six tennis courts, a football practice field, track, a baseball stadium, a softball stadium, a soccer field, and a marching band practice field are all located on the high school property. Bradner Stadium, named for former school superintendent James William \\"J.W.\\" Bradner, is located in downtown Middlesboro on 15th Street and has a seating capacity of 6,000. The field at the stadium is known as Lee Majors Field, named after famous MHS alum and movie star, Harvey \\"Lee\\" Yeary. During football season, the street in front of the stadium is painted with the yellow jacket emblem used by the athletic programs. Fuson Brothers Gymnasium is the home of the Yellow Jackets and Lady Jackets basketball programs. Named for MHS athletic standouts Ig and Ug Fuson, Fuson Brothers Gymnaisum features a recently renovated floor featuring new athletic logos, six basketball goals, and two tiers of seating on both sides of the gym. ==Curriculum== Middlesboro High School follows Kentucky's Pre-College Curriculum as mandated by Kentucky Education Association. Seniors who wish to pursue a vocational curriculum may attend the Bell County Area Technology Center, which offers programs in auto body repair, automotive technology, carpentry, computer technology, health services, and office technology. ==LPFM radio station construction permit== On January 31, 2014, the Middlesboro Board of Education was granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a new Low Power FM (LPFM) radio station. The transmitter and studios will be located at Middlesboro High School. After construction, the new station will transmit on a frequency of 95.5 MHz with transmitter output of 100 watts. The new station will cover all of Middlesboro and some of the outlying areas. The new stations callsign will be WYJR-LP, for \\"Yellow Jacket Radio\\". ==Notable alumni== *Lee Majors (class of 1957), television actor.

The newly independent Dominican Republic was recovering economically from the recently ended Dominican War of Independence (1844‚Äì1856), when the Republic won its independence against Haiti. The Spanish Crown and authorities, which scorned and rejected the peace treaties signed after the dismantling of some of its colonies in the Spanish West Indies some 50 years prior, welcomed his proposal and set to reestablish the colony. The end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865 and the re-assertion of the Monroe Doctrine by the United States, which was no longer involved in internal conflict and possessing enormously expanded and modernized military forces as a result of the war, prompted the evacuation of Spanish forces back to Cuba that same year. ==Resistance== Santana becomes Governor-General On July 4, 1861, former President Francisco del Rosario Sanchez was captured and executed after leading a failed invasion of Santo Domingo from Haiti. On August 16, 1863, 14 anti-annexationists led by Santiago Rodriguez Masago made a daring raid on the Capotillo Hill, where they raised the Dominican flag. Except for Santo Domingo and some of the neighboring towns, the whole country rose in arms, and several towns in Cibao joined the rebellion. Soon, 6,000 Dominican insurgents rallied to Gaspar Polanco's army, which besieged Fort San Luis and its 800-man Spanish garrison and captured it on September 13. A steam frigate went to the support of Spanish troops holed up in the fort at Puerto Plata and drove off the rebels by firing grapeshot. Self-appointed president Jose Antonio Salcedo unsuccessfully lobbied for United States aid in the war, but the guerrillas killed a total of 1,000 Spaniards by March 1864, while another 9,000 had perished from fever. The 21,000-strong Spanish garrison received 6,000 reinforcements, and Jose de la Gandara y Navarro was appointed the new Spanish commander. La Gandara attempted to broker a ceasefire with the rebels, but Gaspar Polanco overthrew and assassinated Salcedo, who had made costly military mistakes and intended to recall the unpopular Buenaventura Baez to serve as President once more. After a failed attack on the Spanish at Monte Cristi, Polanco was overthrown by his own brother Juan Antonio Polanco, Pedro Antonio Pimentel, and Benito Moncion, who appointed Benigno Filomeno de Rojas as the new President in January 1865. By then, the American Civil War was almost at an end, frightening Spain. Queen Isabella II of Spain annulled the annexation on March 3, 1865, and, by July 15, there were no Spanish troops left on the island. == Governors ==  1861‚Äì1865  *1861‚Äì1862: Pedro Santana *1862‚Äì1863: Felipe Ribero y Lemoine *1863‚Äì1864: Carlos de Vargas *1864‚Äì1865: Jos√© de la G√°ndara ==See also== * History of the Dominican Republic * First Republic * Second Republic * Third Republic ==References== Category:1865 disestablishments Category:19th century in the Dominican Republic Category:Colonial government in the West Indies Category:Dominican Republic‚ÄìSpain relations Santo Domingo, Spanish occupation of Category:History of the Dominican Republic Category:Spanish West Indies Category:States and territories established in 1861 Category:1861 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Military occupation ","title":"Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic"},{"id":"19351696","text":"Hope for the Hopeless is the third studio album by the American singer- songwriter Brett Dennen.

Onomastics suggest that he was a Lombard originally from southern Italy. Atinolfo was staying in Florence when he was appointed bishop by the Emperor Conrad II in February or March 1038. His predecessor, also an imperial appointee, was Iacopo il Bavaro, was a reformer who restored the diocesan patrimony. Atinolfo appears to have been otherwise. He repossessed the possessions of the diocese which Iacopo had granted to the monastery of San Bartolomeo. As late as July 1039 he was still not consecrated, despite the growing movement within Latin Christendom against that practice. He appears also to have been an imperial partisan, though imperial intervention in ecclesiastical affairs would soon stir up the Investiture Controversy. On 25 October 1046 he attended the Synod of Pavia convoked by the Emperor Henry III. Nonetheless, Atinolfo signed the canons with Gerard, Bishop of Florence, of a Roman synod convened under Pope Leo IX, a reformer, in May 1050. On 15 July 1050, while the pope was passing through Florence, the monks of San Bartolomeo met him and implored him to confirm the donation that Iacopo had made to them. The pope did and Atinolof complied by restoring the possessions in a charter in which he describes Conrad II, not the pope, as senior mei (my lord). Atinolof was last recorded in July 1057 at a synod of Tuscan bishops in Arezzo under Pope Victor II. ==References== *\\"Atinolfo.\\" Dizionario biografico degli Italiani, vol.

He was a survivor of Captain Robert Scott's Terra Nova Expedition to Antarctica (1910‚Äì1913). Taylor was a senior academic geographer at universities in Sydney, Chicago, and Toronto. His writings on geography and race were controversial. ==Early life== Thomas Griffith Taylor on a horse, Canberra, 1913 Image: National Library of Australia Taylor was born in the town of Walthamstow, England, to parents James Taylor, a metallurgical chemist, and Lily Agnes, n√©e Griffiths. Within a year after his birth, the family had moved to Serbia where his father was manager of a copper mine. Three years later, they returned to Britain when his father became director of analytical chemistry for a major steelworks company. In 1893, the family emigrated to New South Wales Australia, where James secured a position as a government metallurgist. Taylor, age 13, attended The King's School in Sydney. He enrolled in arts at the University of Sydney in 1899, later transferring to science, attaining his Bachelor of Science in 1904, and Bachelor of Engineering (mining and metallurgy) in 1905. In 1904 he joined the teaching staff at Newington College. Awarded an 1851 Exhibition scholarship in 1907 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a B.A. [Research], Taylor was elected a fellow of the Geological Society, London in 1909. While at Cambridge, he established strong friendships with (Sir) Raymond Priestley, Canada's Charles Wright and the Australian Frank Debenham who all shared his passion for Antarctic exploration and would all travel with him to the Antarctic as part of the Terra Nova Expedition 1910‚Äì1913. ==Antarctic Expedition== The explorer Robert Falcon Scott contracted Taylor to the Terra Nova Expedition to Antarctica. Scott was looking for an experienced team, and appointed Taylor as Senior Geologist. It was agreed that Taylor would act as representative for the weather service, due to the known effects of Antarctic weather conditions on Australia's climate. Thomas Griffith Taylor, southeast of Hut Point near Cape Evans, Antarctica, 15 October 1911 Image: National Library of Australia Taylor was the leader of the successful geological team, responsible for the first maps and geological interpretations of significant areas of Antarctica. In January 1911, he led an expedition to the coastal area west of McMurdo Sound, in a region between the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the Koettlitz Glacier.See Scott's instructions, SLE, Vol. II, pp. 184‚Äì85. He led a second successful expedition in November 1911, this time centering on the Granite Harbour region approximately 50 miles (80 km) north of Butter Point.Scott's instructions; SLE, Vol. II, pp. 222‚Äì23. Meanwhile, Scott led a party of five on a journey to the South Pole, in a race to get there before a rival expedition led by Norwegian Roald Amundsen. They reached the Pole in January 1912, only to find a tent left there by Amundsen containing a dated message informing them that he had reached the Pole 5 weeks earlier. Scott's entire team perished during the return journey, only 11 miles from safety. Taylor's party was due to be picked up by the Terra Nova supply ship on 15 January 1912, but the ship could not reach them. They waited until 5 February before trekking southward, and were rescued from the ice when they were finally spotted by the ship on 18 February. Taylor left Antarctica in March 1912 on board the Terra Nova, unaware of the fate of Scott's polar party. Geological specimens from both Western Mountains expeditions were retrieved by Terra Nova in January 1913. Later that year, Taylor was awarded the King's Polar medal and made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London. Taylor's physiographical and geomorphological Antarctic research earned him a doctorate (D.Sc) from the University of Sydney in 1916. He was made Associate Professor of Geography in 1921 becoming the founding head of the Department of Geography at the university. Taylor did not completely agree with the Australian Government's White Australia policy, which sought to limit immigrants to whites only. Taylor argued that Australia's agricultural resources were limited, and that this, together with other environmental factors, meant that Australia would not be able to support the population goal of 100 million which some optimistically predicted. Moreover, he claimed that due to climatic factors, the interior of Australia would be best settled by broad-headed Mongoloids who were better adapted to the environment. He was severely criticised as unpatriotic for his views on Australia's future development. A textbook he had written containing these views was banned from schools by the Western Australian education authority. Taylor was a proponent of environmental determinism with the view that \\"physical environment determines culture.\\" In 1927, he became the first President of the Geographical Society of New South Wales. ==Environment, race, and migration== Taylor wrote many books about the effects of the environment in shaping race. He also wrote extensively about migration of the races. Taylor saw theories that explained the genealogy of races as beginning in Africa and then expanding out through the world and evolving in positive ways as antiquated thinking from the 19th century. In his 1937 book Environment, Race, and Migration, Taylor outlines a theory that the \\"Mongolian\\" race is the race truest to their past in the hearth of modern humans: Central Asia. Australoid and Negroid races were the first to branch off during humanity's evolution from the Neanderthal and were racially adapted to live in the world's margins. The Negrito race was never related to Neanderthals, and were thus likely developed more directly from apes. \\"During the million years of Post-Pliocene\\" time, humans were forced to migrate during four major migrations related to the expansion of the \\"Great Ice Sheet.\\" As humans moved to different areas of the world they adapted to the environment they encountered. Taylor openly disagrees with Wegener's theory of Continental Drift, writing that the human races evidently migrated into world's regions separately and over time. They moved out over the world, the world didn't move them. (Note: this was written in a period before knowledge of plate tectonics). Taylor links skin pigment to temperature and collects extensive data from the period on geology, topology, meteorology, and anthropology. Taylor saw geography in a synthesising role between explanations of the physical world and the diffusion and evolution of the human species. \\"The fittest tribes evolve and survive in the most stimulating regions; i.e., where living is not so hard as to stunt mental development, and not so easy as to encourage sloth and loss of initiative. The least fit are ultimately crowded out into the deserts, the tropical jungles, or the rugged mountains.\\" In regards to anthropology, Taylor looks at records of hair texture and size, nose size, ear size, cephalic indices, skin color, and height. He links sexual attraction amongst different races to evolved and diverged cultural preferences for beauty. Taylor comes up with the theory of the \\"tri-peninsular world\\", in which the world is divided into three peninsulas descending south from a common point in the Arctic (Americas, Europe and Africa, Asia and Australia). In these peninsulas, Taylor finds climate and race similarities. In regards to racial variation within smaller regions, Taylor offers this passage about Europe's races: \\"The Eur-African peninsula is now considered. Here the racial types have been fairly well investigated. We know that the term \\"European\\" has no value as an ethnological distinction. Thus the Savoyard of eastern France is akin to the wild tribes of the Pamirs, but not to the primitive peoples of the Dordogne only two hundred miles to the west. The Corsican is much more nearly allied to the Cornishman than to the Italian peoples of the adjacent Alps. In Wales, we are told, there are small groups still essentially allied to Neanderthal man.\\" The most suitable parts of the world for habitation are, according to Taylor, in Europe, Western Siberia, the Americas, and Eastern China. These are the places that, if not already overcrowded, are where the world's masses must one day move into. Places least adaptable to European styles of agriculture and settlement are considered by Taylor \\"useless\\". In the final section of the book Taylor lays out the possibilities of future expansion of the white race, which he sees as the only race which will expand. Though he voices that no Europeans would wish to extinguish or force native people from their lands, \\"these primitive people are doomed to extinction...\\" Whites would eventually settle all \\"useful lands.\\" Taylor disagreed with theories that put the Nordic race as the apotheosis of mankind. By his theory, Asiatic races would be the most pure. He gives great accolades to the Chinese race. He links Europe's historical accession in the global sphere to command of the seas and easy access to plentiful surface coal. Taylor takes a seemingly contradictory viewpoint by both decrying miscegenation and saying that white Australian women who married Chinese men were OK to do so. Mixing of more advanced races was, ostensibly, acceptable, while miscegenation with more primitive races was to be abhorred. All citations are from the book Environment, Race, and Migration. ==Move to North America and return to Australia== In 1929, he accepted a post as Senior Professor of Geography at the University of Chicago. In 1936 he moved to the University of Toronto founding the Geography department there. During the 1930s, Taylor was co-editor of the German journal on racial studies Zeitschrift fur Rassenkunde, he felt that American scholars were concerned too little with racial classification, and showed an affinity to the works of Baron von Eickstedt. In 1940 he was elected president of the Association of American Geographers, the first non-American to be elected to the post. Taylor was close to Isaiah Bowman who shared similar interests in population and settlement studies. After retiring from his post at the university in 1951, he returned to Sydney. In 1954 he was elected to the Australian Academy of Science, the only geographer to receive this distinction. In 1958 he published his autobiography \\"Journeyman Taylor\\", and in 1959 was named the first President of the Institute of Australian Geographers. ==Personal life and legacy== Taylor died in the Sydney suburb of Manly on 5 November 1963, aged 82. In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post. In 2001, an Australian postage stamp commemorated Taylor and fellow explorer Douglas Mawson. Taylor was the author of some 20 books and 200 scientific articles. He was the brother-in-law of fellow Terra Nova expedition members Raymond Priestley and C.S. Wright. ==References External links == * *Thomas Griffin Taylor archival papers held at the University of Toronto Archives and Records Management Services Category:20th-century English writers Category:1880 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:Amateur anthropologists Category:English anthropologists Category:English explorers Category:English geologists Category:Explorers of Antarctica Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:People educated at The King's School, Parramatta Category:People from Sydney Category:People from Walthamstow Category:Presidents of the American Association of Geographers Category:Staff of Newington College Category:Terra Nova expedition Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:20th-century geologists ","title":"Thomas Griffith Taylor"},{"id":"19351750","text":"Douglas James \\"Doug\\" Holtz-Eakin (born February 3, 1958) is an American economist. He was formerly an economics professor at Syracuse University, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and chief economic policy adviser to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Holtz-Eakin is currently president of the American Action Forum policy institute, a conservative think tank. ==Early life== Douglas James Eakin was born and raised in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1958, where his Navy-veteran father worked as a steel plant manager. He received a B.A. in economics and mathematics from Denison University in 1980 and a Ph.D in economics from Princeton University in 1985. He took his first wife's maiden name, Holtz, as part of his own upon their marriage in 1981. ==Career== Holtz-Eakin established his academic career with appointments at Princeton (1984‚Äì89) and Columbia University (1985‚Äì90). From August 1989 to July 1990, Holtz-Eakin served as a Senior Staff Economist on President George H.W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. From 1986 to 2001 he also served as a Faculty Research Fellow and Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Holtz-Eakin was tenured faculty at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University from 1990 to 2003, where he was appointed Professor in 1995 and Chair of the Department of Economics from 1997 to 2001. In 2003, Holtz-Eakin left Syracuse University to become Director of the Congressional Budget Office. Under his leadership, the budget office undertook a study of tax rates, which found that any new revenue that tax cuts brought in paled in comparison with their cost. He left the appointment in 2005. Holtz-Eakin is also the President of DHE Consulting, LLC, and has served as Director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies and the Paul A. Volcker Chair in International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as a senior visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics from 2007 to 2008. In 2009, he joined the Manhattan Institute's Center for Medical Progress as a fellow focusing on health care reform issues, but left later that year to found his own think tank. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appointed Holtz-Eakin to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2009. Economic adviser to John McCain In 2007, Holtz-Eakin was hired as chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Through the campaign and coincident 2008 economic crisis, he remained in the media spotlight on the candidate's proposals for the economy and health care. Holtz-Eakin drew particular attention when he claimed that, as a U.S. Senator on the Commerce Committee, McCain \\"helped create\\" the BlackBerry wireless device. President of American Action Forum In early 2010, Holtz-Eakin became president of American Action Forum, a conservative think tank focused on fiscal and public policy issues. Since joining American Action Forum, Holtz-Eakin has appeared on Fox News to argue against a 2010 health care bill, as well as writing a similarly worded Op-Ed for The New York Times. Holtz- Eakin has been active in supporting Senate immigration bill S.744, which would increase annual legal immigration numbers, legalize illegal immigrants in the United States and some who have already been deported, and promises future enforcement efforts to deter future illegal immigration. ==Personal life== Holtz-Eakin currently lives in Washington, D.C., is married to Beth Robinson, and has two children, one a 2007 graduate of Swarthmore College. One son, Colin D. Holtz, is a progressive blogger and activist based in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2013, Holtz-Eakin was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. ==References * Douglas J.

It consists of an outer crown which is covered with black silk, and the inner which is filled with cotton and hard paper. Its top is decorated with cloisonn√© ornaments. The crown is also called jokdu or jokgwan and is used mostly as an accessory. The upper part is vaguely hexagonal and the bottom is cylindrical. The form of jokduri gets narrower from the top to the bottom. jokduri can be used to display the wearer's social status by being adorned with accessories made from gold or silver. ==History== It is said that the jokduri was derived from the Mongolian woman's cap for outing, the gogori () in the late Goryeo period. It began to be used in that period as intermarriages between Goryeo and the Yuan Dynasty of China happened. However, the jokduri during the Goryeo period is assumed to be bigger and higher than the one in the Joseon period. During the Joseon Dynasty, the jokduri became smaller and there was not much difference in the overall shape between the top and the bottom. During the reign of King Gwanghaegun, black silk began to be used for the covering whereas purple silk was used as the inner fabric. Thereafter, as women enjoyed wearing a jokduri, it became almost a national style in fashion. In the late Joseon period, King Yeongjo (r. 1724-1776) and Jeongjo (r. 1776‚Äì1800) prohibited women from wearing gache (wigs) and, instead, encouraged them to wear jokduri. In 1788, the twelfth year of King Jeongjo's reign, he published an interdictory decree on jokduri, a prohibition against excessive usage of cloisonn√©, and the designation of black for the inner material such as cotton, and bamboo. Different kinds of jokguri have been used for weddings, funerals, and for daily use in the royal court.

Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the fourth round of the competition. In all, 139 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. ==The 1983 final== The final was played at the home ground of Gisborne City, one of the two finalists. The replay was at the home ground of the other finalist, Mount Wellington. Mount Wellington appeared in their fifth consecutive final - the only club to have achieved this feat up until this time (it has since also been achieved by Christchurch United, between 1987 and 1991). Mount players Tony Sibley and Ron Armstrong joined an elite group to have played in four Chatham Cup-winning sides, having previously played in Mount Wellington's victories in 1973, 1980, and 1982. The first match was a gritty, evenly matched affair, with any superiority which Mount Wellington may have had largely counteracted by the efforts of the vocal East Coast spectators. Fred de Jong opened the scoring for the Aucklanders after 14 minutes, only for Colin Walker to equalise halfway through the first half. In the second period Walker put the East Coasters ahead, and they held the advantage until the dying minutes when Keith Nelson, scorer of the only goal in the 1982 final, scored for the Mount to level the tie. Gisborne held on during extra time despite the Mount dominating the extra half-hour. pp. 78-79 The replay, under floodlights at Mount Wellington's ground, was far less balanced. The Mount took the lead on the half-hour mark with a John Price penalty, and the game was put firmly out of Gisborne's reach just before the final whistle by a shot from Nelson. p. 79 ==Results== Third Round * Won on penalties by Oratia United (3-0) and Mount Roskill (5-4) Fourth Round Fifth Round * Napier City Rovers won 4-1 on penalties.

Much of Germany then was a patchwork of small to medium-sized jurisdictions. While this factor impeded development towards a nation-state, it ensured plentiful opportunities for ambitious bureaucrats and entrepreneurs. After leaving his hometown, he first became M√ºnzwardein in D√∂mitz (Mecklenburg), then was appointed in 1683 M√ºnzmeister to the Princess of Nassau-Holzappel in Cramberg on the Lahn river, followed by his appointment in 1687 as M√ºnzmeister (Master of the Mint) to the Teutonic Knights in Friedberg, and in 1692 as M√ºnzmeister for the Archbishopric/Electorate of Mainz in Aschaffenburg. Among the oldest items pertaining to the Bethmann family in the (online) archives of the city of Frankfurt is the file of a criminal complaint brought by Konrad in 1685 while he was in the employ of the House of Nassau.

How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America was awarded a 2008 American Book Award and the 2009 Arab American Book Award for Non-Fiction. In This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror (NYU Press, 2015), Bayoumi reveals what the War on Terror looks like from the vantage point of Muslim Americans, highlighting the profound effect this surveillance has had on how they live their lives. The essays expose how contemporary politics, movies, novels, media experts and more have together produced a culture of fear and suspicion that not only willfully forgets the Muslim-American past, but also threatens all of our civil liberties in the present. This Muslim American Life was awarded the 2016 Evelyn Shakir Non-Fiction Arab American Book Award. ==References *Moustafa Bayoumi official website *Faculty: Moustafa Bayoumi at Brooklyn College **A Postcolonial Scholar in the Department of English Takes Pride in Student Success, September 8, 2004 *Column archive at The Progressive *Column archive at The Nation *Edward W.

At 19 he moved to London to study at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1952 he won the Suggia Prize, which gave him the chance to study in Paris for a year, with the famous cellist Pierre Fournier. On his return to England, Simpson soon got work both for the Brighton Philharmonic, the London Chamber Orchestra, and as a solo performer. In 1956 he received an offer to join the very prestigious Aeolian String Quartet. He remained with the quartet until it disbanded in 1981. The ensemble, among other things, made a complete recording of Haydn's string quartets - a project that took six years to complete. Simpson also had time for other projects, however, and his playing can be heard on The Beatles' singles Strawberry Fields Forever. He taught at the Royal Academy of Music, where several of his many pupils took part in memorial tribute concerts in January and February 2008 (see External Links). He was among the teachers of Raphael Wallfisch. Among his active pupils are: Angela East,Angela East profile Benedict Rogerson, Mary Pells, Justin Pearson, Hafli√∞i Hallgr√≠msson, Robert Ibell,Robert Ibell on New Zealand Symphony Orchestra webpage Susan Sheppard, Sebastian Comberti and Alasdair Strange. Many of his students share an interest in historically informed performance. Simpson was married three times; his last wife was his colleague in the Aeolian Quartet, Margaret Major. His first wife, Fiona Cameron, was the daughter of his teacher Douglas Cameron, and a concert pianist with whom he would occasionally perform. With Fiona he had two children. He also had a third son who died in a car accident in 1972. ==Selected recordings== *Monteverdi, Il ballo dell'ingrate (London Chamber Players/Ambrosian Singers cond.

Following the death of Langdon's father in 1875, his mother ran a cattle and wheat ranch. Langdon was educated in the public schools and Hayward High School. He graduated from the California State Normal School to become a teacher, while also studying law in the offices of future Supreme Court Justice John E. Richards. In 1896, Langdon was admitted to the state Bar. Langdon served as vice principal and principal at schools in San Leandro, Fresno, and San Francisco, eventually becoming the city's school superintendent in 1902. ==Legal and judicial career== In November 1905, city voters elected Langdon as district attorney of San Francisco, and in 1907 re- elected him to a second term. A popular district attorney, Langdon was nominated by the Independence League as its choice for governor in the 1906 elections. Langdon's presence as a strong third party candidacy won over 14 percent of the vote, proving to be a spoiler vote in a tight race between Democrat Theodore A. Bell and Republican James Gillett. In 1907, one year after the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake, Langdon carried out the successful prosecutions both of Mayor Eugene Schmitz and political machine operator Abe Ruef for bribery and extortion, along with special assistants Francis J. Heney, Hiram Johnson and Matt Sullivan. After his tenure as district attorney, Langdon entered banking, serving with several banks around Modesto and managing the property his wife had inherited from her first husband. In 1913, he served as the head of the State Board of Education. In 1915, he reentered law when Governor Hiram Johnson appointed Langdon a judge of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County. In December 1918, Governor William Stephens appointed Langdon presiding judge of the newly minted First District, Second Division, of the California Court of Appeal. In 1920, Langdon was elected to a full term. In November 1926, Langdon won election to a 12-year term as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California, where he served the next nineteen years until his death in 1939.Johnson, J. Edward (1966). \\"William H. Langdon\\", History of the Supreme Court Justices of California, 1900‚Äì1950. San Francisco, CA: Bancroft-Whitney. pp. 131‚Äì36. Retrieved July 18, 2017. Langdon filled the unexpired term of William P. Lawlor, who died in office in July 1926, and whose seat was filled for three months by the appointment of Jeremiah F. Sullivan. From 1930 until 1939, treatise author Bernard E. Witkin served as Langdon's law clerk. In October 1939, the vacancy in Langdon's seat was filled by Governor Culbert Olson with the appointment of Phil S. Gibson. Among Langdon's notable cases is his 1930 dissent in the denial of a commuted sentence of convicted double murderer Ernest A. Dias. The majority of the court upheld the death penalty, but in dissent Langdon urged the governor to grant executive clemency on the basis of Dias' mental incompetence at the time of the killings. ==Personal life== On April 20, 1908, he married Stanford-trained school teacher, Myrtie Conneau McHenry (December 2, 1878 ‚Äì August 18, 1959), a wealthy widow from Modesto, California. They had one son: Lawton William Langdon (April 15, 1913 ‚Äì September 23, 1960). His wife, Myrtie, also had two children from her first marriage: Lois Ann (\\"Annie\\") Langdon (Moran) (January 28, 1910 ‚Äì May 11, 1973) and Merl McHenry (December 3, 1903 ‚Äì January 3, 1994). ==See also== * List of justices of the Supreme Court of California ==FootnotesReferences== * Leonard, John William (1911).

It has a rare publishing history: it was originally serialized from January 1, 1990 to April 2, 1992 by Shueisha (with 3 tank≈çbon) and later resumed with a 6th volume in a new manga compilation by Fusosha (with 6 tank≈çbon in total). The series is currently unfinished but it is expected that Nagai will resume it in the future. The manga is considered a combination of Mazinger with Devilman because of the complexity of its plot and thematic. While this Mazinger is actually more an armored warrior instead of a giant super robot, it is also considered part of the Mazinger saga. ==Plot== MazinSaga tells the story of the young Koji Kabuto, a university student who finds himself having to collect the fruit of the researches of his father, a physicist of worldwide reputation who died in mysterious circumstances. The boy is entrusted with a portentous artifact, Mazinger Z, the Armor of God, an extraordinary shell composed of the Super Spiritual Materia Z. The material, of which the armor is composed and discovered by the father of Koji before his death, gives the powers of a god or a demon: everything depends on the will and the spirit of its user. And the devastating powers of Mazinger Z manifest itself in all its violence when Koji, wearing the armor for the first time, will decree nothing less than the end of the whole planet Earth. It will be this event that will bring him to move to the planet Mars of the future, to help earth survivors and refugees there, against a frightening and mysterious alien enemy. ==Videogame== The manga has a videogame for the Sega Mega Drive with the same name in Asia and Japan. It was called Mazin Saga Mutant Fighter in the US and Mazin Wars in Europe. ==References * MazinSaga at The World of Go Nagai webpage * MazinSaga at D/visual * MazinSaga at PaTaTo's Manga DB

Retrieved 17 September 2008. ==Operations== The eight-car sets are primarily used on limited-stop \\"Rapid Limited Express\\" and \\"Limited Express\\" services on the Keikyu Main Line, including through-running services to and from the Toei Asakusa Line, Keisei Oshiage Line, Keisei Main Line, and Hokuso Line.Some of these eight cars sets are also being used on the Keikyu Airport Line. Four-car sets are used to form 12-car \\"Rapid Limited Express\\" and \\"Limited Express\\" services, and are also used singly on all- stations \\"Local\\" services. The six-car formations delivered from 2011 are generally used on all-stations \\"Local\\" services.

When Keikyu N1000 series that use SiC- VVVF system entered service, Toei banned those trains running through service due to unknown reasons. But it seems like this ban has cleared, when Keikyu N1000 set 1225F was first seen at Keisei-Takasago Station. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOQ8cdSAYco ==Variants== Since the first set was introduced in March 2002, the type has undergone a number of design improvements.

One Lat√©co√®re 25 was involved in a celebrated incident when it made a forced landing high in the Andes. Hitherto, flights between Buenos Aires and Santiago made a detour to avoid the mountains. On 2 March 1929, while searching for a safe route across the range, a Lat√©co√®re 25 piloted by Jean Mermoz was caught in a downdraught and forced down onto a plateau just across at an altitude of . With his mechanic Alexandre Collenot and passenger, Count Henry de La Vaulx, Mermoz spent the next four days repairing and lightening the aircraft and making a clear path from it to the edge of the precipice.

It starred primarily Sam Trammell and Brad William Henke as Kevin \\"Space\\" Lauglin and Henry \\"Hank\\" Ungalow respectively, two friends on a road trip across the continental United States. The show focused primarily on what happened to Hank and Space during their stops and detours along the way to California. John Asher played the recurring character \\"Insect Bob\\" and also served as a director on the series. The tag line for this show was: \\"No map. No plan. No rules.

Accessed July 3, 2019. WorldPride, licensed by InterPride and organized by one of its members, is an event that promotes lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ pride) issues on an international level through parades, festivals and other cultural activities. The inaugural WorldPride was held in Rome in 2000. The host cities are selected by InterPride, an international association of pride coordinators, at its annual general meeting. WorldPride celebrations tend to be the largest LGBTQ Pride events for their year. == WorldPride Rome 2000 == Image from the first WorldPride, held in Rome on July 8, 2000 At the 16th annual conference of InterPride, held in October 1997 in New York City, InterPride's membership voted to establish the \\"WorldPride\\" title and awarded it to the city of Rome, Italy during July 1 to July 9, 2000. The event was put on by the Italian gay rights group Mario Mieli along with InterPride. Rome officials had promised to put up US$200,000 for the event, however bowing to ferocious opposition from the Vatican and conservative politicians, Rome's leftist mayor, Francesco Rutelli, on May 30, 2000 withdrew logistical and monetary support. Hours after his announcement, Rutelli mostly reversed himself in response to harsh criticism from the left. He restored the funding and promised to help with permits, but declined to back down on a demand that organizers remove the city logo from promotional materials. The event was staunchly opposed by Pope John Paul II and seen as an infringement on the numerous Catholic pilgrims visiting Rome for the Catholic Church's Great Jubilee. Pope John Paul II addressed crowds in St. Peter's Square during WorldPride 2000 stating, in regards to the event, that it was an \\"offence to the Christian values of a city that is so dear to the hearts of Catholics across the world.\\" The organisers claimed 250,000 people joined in the march to the Colosseum and the Circus Maximus, two of Rome's most famous ancient sites. It was one of the biggest crowds to gather in Rome for decades. Among the scheduled events were conferences, a fashion show, a large parade, a leather dance, and a concert featuring Gloria Gaynor, The Village People, RuPaul and Geri Halliwell. == WorldPride Jerusalem 2006 == The 22nd annual conference of InterPride, held in October 2003 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with over 150 delegates from 51 cities from around the world in attendance, voted to accept the bid of the Jerusalem Open House to host WorldPride 2006 in the Holy City. The first attempt to hold WorldPride in Jerusalem was in 2005, however it was postponed until 2006 because of tensions arising from Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. It was called ‚ÄúLove Without Borders‚Äù as a nod to the many barriers within Israel, and for gays and lesbians in other ways. World Pride was a key project of Jerusalem‚Äôs Open House, the city‚Äôs gay community centre. After Jerusalem was selected as the WorldPride 2006 City, the city of Tel Aviv announced that it was cancelling its own annual Pride Weekend in 2006 to make sure that more Israelis attended the main march. As WorldPride started in 2006, the main parade was scheduled for August 6, but was strongly opposed by Israeli religious Orthodox Jews,Muslims and Christian leaders from the outset. However, due to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, Jerusalem's government cancelled the march, saying there were not enough soldiers to protect marchers. A week of events took place as scheduled and included five conferences, a film festival, exhibitions, and literary and political events. The parade was cancelled but the Jerusalem Open House announced that it would hold a parade on November 10 after reaching an agreement with the police and the municipality. == WorldPride London 2012 == Part of the Pride Walk going past Trafalgar Square, London in 2012 Polish Rainbow in UK at WorldPride / Pride London 2012 The 27th annual conference of InterPride, held in October 2008 in Vancouver, Canada, voted to accept the bid of Pride London to host WorldPride 2012 in the capital of the United Kingdom just ahead of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games and during the anticipated year-long celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. Pride London planned a parade with floats, a large performance area in Trafalgar Square with street parties in Golden Square and Soho. However, London's World Pride event was significantly \\"scaled back\\" at an emergency all-agencies meeting on 27 June 2012, nine days before the event was due to take place and after the festival fortnight had started. Pride London organisers had failed to secure the funds necessary for contractors of key areas of the work, and they announced that all activities were being cut or cancelled. The London Evening Standard reported that four contractors from the previous year's Pride event were owed ¬£65,000 in unpaid debts, though this has been denied by Pride London. Consequently, the entertainment and stages were all cut, and licence applications for street parties in Soho withdrawn. Instead, the event plans included a Pride Walk (without floats or vehicles), and a scaled-back rally in Trafalgar Square. On 5 July, the Metropolitan Police issued a licence regulations notice to all venues in Soho, reminding them that Pride London had no licence for street events in the Soho area, and therefore venues should treat WorldPride as \\"any normal day\\". Peter Tatchell and former Pride London Associate Director James-J Walsh in an article for PinkNews criticised the management of Pride London's management of World Pride. Tatchell said \\"Whatever the rights and wrongs, this scaling down of WorldPride is a huge embarrassment for London and for our LGBT community. We promised LGBT people world-wide a fabulous, spectacular event. It now looks like WorldPride in London will go down in history as a damp squib. We‚Äôre not only letting down LGBT people in Britain, we‚Äôre also betraying the trust and confidence of LGBT people world-wide. This is an absolute disaster.\\" Walsh added \\"This will mar the work of Pride London for years to come. Pride London has lost the focus of being an LGBT campaigning organisation, instead focusing on partying rather than politics, which is what the community needs when legislation around equal marriage and LGBT rights are still to be won both in the UK and around the world.\\" Following community pressure, Pride London, a registered charity since 2004, withdrew from organising future Pride events in London. In December 2012 the Mayor of London's Office awarded the contract to Pride in London. == WorldPride Toronto 2014 == Olivia Chow during Pride Toronto 2014, host of WorldPride 2014 Pride Toronto, in partnership with the city's tourism agency, Tourism Toronto, submitted a bid to host WorldPride 2014 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from June 20 to June 29, 2014. The 28th annual conference of InterPride, held in October 2009 in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States, voted to accept the bid of Pride Toronto to host WorldPride 2014 for the first time in North America. In the first round of voting Toronto won 77 votes to Stockholm's 61.

historic train station that occupies a large property on the southern shore of Lake Simcoe in the waterfront area of Barrie, Ontario, Canada. The current station and former station were built on a burial site of the Huron indigenous peoples. Construction of the new facility began in 2009. GO Transit announced on 15 June 2011 that the station would open in the autumn of 2011, but construction delayed its opening until January 2012. Bus service to the station began on 28 January 2012, with the train service following two days later. A ceremonial train trip from Allandale Waterfront GO Station to Bradford GO Station officially opened the station on 29 January 2012. ==History== Old Allandale Station undergoing renovations Early years The Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railway (OS&HUR;) first built a station here in 1853. The current structure, the fourth station building on the site, was designed by the architectural firm Spier and Rohns, built in 1904 by Richard Scruton, and opened by then-operator Grand Trunk Railway on 19 June 1905. The station provided passenger service for the Grand Trunk and later the Canadian National Railway and Via Rail until closing in 1980. It briefly reopened as a GO passenger facility from 1990 to 1993. In 1996 the CNR lifted rails between Allandale and Longford. ACDC The Allandale Community Development Corporation or 'ACDC' (with City interests) purchased the buildings and adjacent from CNR after train service was discontinued in the 1980s. ACDC then sold the station to CHUM Ltd in 2000. CHUM ownership CHUM Ltd. purchased the of land, including the station buildings, for $1,050,000 in 2000. CHUM planned to restore the Allandale Station building as part of their plan to develop of a new broadcast centre on the site, but changed their plan in 2004. In 2007 CHUM agreed to sell the property to the City for the same amount CHUM originally paid. CHUM received a Charitable Donation tax receipt reflecting the increased value of the property since 2000 largely due to the restoration and site works completed by CHUM. Redevelopment Construction of the new Allandale Waterfront GO Station (located adjacent to the historic Allandale Station) broke ground in spring 2010 and the station officially opened on 28 January 2012. Redevelopment of the station cost approximately $5 million. ==Archeology== The Allandale station site is located on a site used by indigenous peoples. Prior to the original railway construction, a large pit of several hundred indigenous peoples' remains was found. Other ossuaries were found in 1884 and 1889. It was the subject of an archeological excavation, during which objects were recovered from the Uren substage of the Middle Ontario Iroquoian period. It has been dated to the late 12th to early 13th century and was used as a fishing station by the Huron people. It is the only documented fishing station from the Uren period, and one of few sites of that period to have been discovered. The site is regarded by archeologists as a temporary location \\"for exploitation of local fish resources\\". Numerous fish remains were found in the site's midden, but no longhouses were found there. Analysis of the fish remains indicates that various species were caught for consumption at this site. These include species in the family Catostomidae (110 white sucker, 23 longnose sucker, and 103 specimens from other genus Catostomus species), family Percidae (34 yellow perch and 1 walleye), as well as 12 Ictaluridae, 14 largemouth bass and 4 smallmouth bass, 5 Centrarchidae, and specimens from several other species. In 2011, human bone fragment remains were discovered underneath the crawl space of the office building at the site during an excavation for an archeological site assessment as part of grading work for the new train station. These were later determined to have been in the fill used as backfill for the foundation, but were of indeterminate origin. An incisor found amongst those remains was interpreted to be part of the Uren archeological material, but data are insufficient to ascertain its ultimate origin. The Huron-Wendat people consider the site to be a disturbed site of indigenous remains which could be an ossuary. The original train station and yard's construction disturbed the remains and the new station disturbed them further without proper archaeological study. Further, the construction of the GO station did not follow Government of Ontario heritage regulations, which prohibited the disturbance of human remains at a known site. ==Heritage station buildings== The station buildings comprise a federally designated heritage railway station protected by the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act. The Italianate structures are near the southwest shore of Kempenfeldt Bay in Lake Simcoe, separated from it by a public park. The station complex was originally adjacent to Kempenfeldt Bay until the land behind the station was infilled and levelled to build a rail yard. The station complex consists of a station building, an office building, and a restaurant adjacent to each other along the rail line. They have a uniform roof pitch, and form an atypical layout for a railway station. The low-pitched roof and deep overhanging eaves are indicative of Prairie School design influence. Two of the buildings were designed in 1904 by the Detroit firm Spier & Rohns. The interior and exterior features of the buildings are provincially protected under an Ontario Heritage Trust conservation easement. The station building was considered the \\"flagship of the Grand Trunk\\" upon its opening. ==Services== Allandale Waterfront station has weekday train service consisting of 7 trains southbound to Union Station in the morning, and 7 trains returning northbound from Union Station in the afternoon. At other times, GO bus route 68 operates hourly to Aurora GO Station where passengers can transfer to the all-day train service to Toronto. Weekend train service consists of 5 trains in each direction throughout the day. GO bus route 68 also operates hourly to Aurora GO station or East Gwillimbury GO station where passengers can connect to the hourly weekend train service to Toronto. ==References * *Allandale Station

motorsport club based in British Columbia, Canada. The club was founded in 1951 as a non-profit society and is currently active at Mission Raceway Park. Early days saw the membership host races at airports in Cassidy and Abbotsford. In the late 1950s, the club built a new road racing circuit on the remote, rural hillside in Coquitlam, a suburb of Vancouver. The track became known as Westwood Motorsport Park and was the first permanent, purpose-built road circuit in Canada. Built through volunteer hours and money raised through the sale of debentures, the track was the focal point of the club for over thirty years until encroaching urban development forced it to permanently close in 1990. During the Westwood years, the club held successful events that attracted later well-known drivers such as Gilles Villeneuve, Keke Rosberg, and Bobby Rahal. In the early years, the SCCBC also held hill climbs, rallies, and gymkhanas at various venues around BC. The club promoted the sport and their organisation through participation in car shows and other public events. In 1994, the SCCBC opened a 2 km road circuit referred to as River's Edge Road Course, part of Mission Raceway Park. The club has operated at this venue since then, hosting events throughout the racing season. The club publishes a monthly newsletter called Pit Pass. ==References== * Johnston, Tom, Westwood, Everyone‚Äôs Favourite Racing Circuit, Granville Island Publishing, ==External links== * Official

The Naxi is a minority with a long history and a brilliant culture. With a population of 300,000, this group lives mainly in Yulong County, Lijiang City, Yunnan. It has become known worldwide or having kept its own ancient and unique Dongba Culture and thus claimed to be a small ethnic group that has created a grand culture. The Dongba culture is a most inclusive term referring mainly to the language and scriptures. The Dongba language is actually composed of 1,400 picture-like characters and symbols that are still used by Dongbas, researchers and artists of the culture. It is by now the only living hieroglyph in the world and is regarded as a precious cultural relic of mankind. On August 30, 2003, the Dongba classical literature was accepted as a written world heritage by UNESCO. Many other countries have built their own collections of Dongba scriptures, for instance, the US, the UK, France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Austria. In the US alone, the collection in the Library of Congress plus that in Harvard University Library numbers over 4000 volumes. In China, Dongba scriptures have been collected by the Library of Yulong County, the Library of Yunnan Province. For better protection, research and development of the Dongba Culture, in 1984 the Naxi Dongba Cultural Museum was under at the Black Dragon Pool of Lijiang. The museum has more than 10000 Dongba cultural relics and various other historical relics and offers the \\"Dongba Culture Exhibition\\", thereby attracting more than 100000 visitors each year. Meanwhile, it also compiles and publishes Newsletter of Dongba Culture and has established the Lijiang Naxi Dongba Cultural School. For its outstanding work over the past years, county museums in China, awarded the honor of \\"Advanced Cultural Unit in China\\", and listed as one of the bases for patriotism education of the province. ==References== * *Ctrip - China Guide > Yunnan > Lijiang Category:Museums in Yunnan Category:Ethnic museums in China Category:Nakhi people Category:Buildings and structures in Lijiang

He is the president of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial committee Deekshabhoomi. ==Early years== Surai Sasai was born in Niimi, Okayama Prefecture, with the lay name Minoru Sasai on 30 August 1935. He took tonsure as a novice monk at the age of 14 and was given the ordination name Tenjit Surai, \\"Light of the Sun, beautiful Mountain Peak\\", by his Tendai teacher Shujuma Yamamoto. In 1955 he joined the monastic order of the Shingon school and in 1966 he travelled to Thailand to study vipassana. ==Spreading Buddhism in India== Sasai came to India in 1966 and met Nichidatsu Fujii, whom he helped with the building of a peace pagoda at Rajgir. He fell out with Fuji, however, but he related that on his return journey he was stopped by a vision of a figure resembling Nagarjuna who said, \\"Go to Nagpur\\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organized the conversion ceremony for B. R. Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of B. R. Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realized that Ambedkar had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur residents considered Surai Sasai very strange, but he became popular after he began to greet them with \\"Jai Bhim\\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas. In 1987, Sasai was arrested for overstaying his visum but his followers protested against his planned deportation. A court case to deport him was dismissed and he was granted Indian citizenship, which cost him his Japanese citizenship. Sasai is one of the main leaders of the campaign to free the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya from Hindu control. As the president of the Bodhisatva Nagarjun Smarak Samstha Va Anusandhan Kendra he supported the excavations at Mansar. Sasai represented the Buddhists as a member of the National Commission for Minorities from 2003-2006. Arya Bhadant Surai Sasai is the president of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Smarak Samiti Deekshabhoomi (Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial committee Deekshabhoomi), Nagpur.https://nmp1toi.indiatimes.com/india/dr-ambedkars-deekshabhoomi-would- continue-to-motivate-crores-of-indians-pm- modi/articleshow/58181376.cmshttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vidarbha- emerge-champions-in-state-level-disabled-cricket- tournament/articleshow/74542159.cms ==Disciples== Sasai has hundreds of thousands of lay followers and hundreds of ordained monk and novice disciples. His most active disciples are Bhante Bodhi Dhamma (Dhammaji), Prajnasheela Bhikkhu, Ken Bodhi, and Bhikkhu Abhaya Putra. The first and last were trained as Theravada monk and the others as Mahayana monks. Bodhi Dhamma works in South India teaching Zen while Prajnasheela works in central India.

The municipality is the lowest level of government, but this does not reflect the importance that the Amsterdam and Rotterdam governments play in Dutch political life. There are a total of 390 municipalities in the Netherlands.1 Centraal Bureau voor Statistiek, 2016. Gemeentelijke indeling op 1 januari 2016 ==Municipal politics== In municipal politics there are three functions: the Mayor, the municipal council and the Aldermen. Together they share legislative power. The mayor chairs both the municipal council and the council of mayor and aldermen. The council of mayor and aldermen exercise the executive power of the municipal government. The relationship between the aldermen and the municipal council is officially dualistic. That is, they have separate responsibilities. Additionally many larger municipalities have Gemeentelijke Rekenkamer (Municipal Chamber of Audit) which oversees the finances of the municipality. Moreover, the two largest municipalities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, have previously been further divided in boroughs called deelgemeenten. Mayor The mayor (burgemeester) chairs both the council of mayor and aldermen and the municipal council. He is a member of the council of mayor and aldermen and has his own portfolios, often including safety and public order. He also has a representative role, as the head of the municipal government. He is appointed by the national government for a renewable six-year term. When a vacancy occurs the municipal council and King's Commissioner express their preferences to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The Minister generally follows the preferences of the municipal council. Almost all mayors are member of a national political party, but they are expected to exercise their office in a non partisan fashion. Municipal council The municipal council (Gemeenteraad, GR) is the elected assembly of the municipality. Its main role is laying down the guidelines for the policy of the council of mayor and aldermen and exercising oversight over the implementation of policy by the council of mayor and aldermen. The municipal council is elected every four years by the general populace. In many municipalities all major political parties contest in the election in addition to local parties. In most major, urban, municipalities all major parties are represented in the municipal council, while in smaller, rural, municipalities only the largest parties and a local party have seats in the municipal council. All citizens and foreigners who live in the Netherlands for at least four years in a municipality have the right to vote and almost all citizens can be elected, ministers and state secretaries in the national government are barred from standing in elections as well as mayors and civil servants employed by the municipality. The number of members of municipal council depends on the number of inhabitants. After the elections the parties in the states elect the aldermen. The municipal council is supported by its own civil service headed by the raadsgriffier. Municipal councillors are not paid as full-time politicians: instead most of them have day jobs. Like most legislatures, the members of municipal councils work in both political groups and policy area related committees. The mayor chairs the meetings of the municipal council. Aldermen The Aldermen (Wethouders) together with the mayor form the College van Burgemeester and Wethouders (Council of Mayor and Aldermen, B&W;). This is the executive council of the municipalities, which implements policy. The members of the Council of Mayor and Aldermen all have their own portfolio on which they prepare, coordinate and plan policy and legislation for the municipal council and implement legislation. The College van B&W; have the duty to inform the municipal council on all aspects of their policy. The College van B&W; functions a collegial body and most decisions are taken by consensus. An alderman will lose his position if the municipal council adopts a motion of no-confidence against him. Aldermen are elected by the municipal council. They cannot be member of the municipal council, although often aldermen used to be members of the municipal council. The aldermen can be appointed in two ways. Either as program council (\\"programcollege\\") or a mirror council (\\"afspiegelingscollege\\"). A program council is based on a political program negotiated by a group of parties which has a majority in the municipal council, while a mirror council represents all (major) parties represents in the municipal legislature. Until 1970 all municipalities were mirror municipalities, since then and especially after the dualisation of municipal politics most council of aldermen and mayor have become programmatic. Those executives often include two or more parties with ideological links. The local executive of Rotterdam in the years 2002 until 2006 for example included the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the locally based Livable Rotterdam. The Labour Party, the second largest party of Rotterdam, was kept out of the executive because of ideological conflicts with Leefbaar Rotterdam. The same happened in city of Groningen, where a left wing executive was appointed on 26 April 2006. It consists of the Labour Party, the Socialist Party and GroenLinks. Some municipal councils allow parties to have dual councillors, politicians who are not elected into the municipal council but are allowed to speak in committees.  Dualism  In 2002 the municipalities were drastically reformed. Before then all aldermen remained member of the municipal council. The municipal council had all the competences in a municipality and it delegated competences to the council of aldermen and mayor. The council of aldermen and mayor de facto functioned as the executive council of the municipality, but de jure they were little more than a powerful committee. In 2002 the responsibilities of municipal council and council of aldermen and mayor were clearly delineated and aldermen were barred from being member of the municipal council. The relationship between the B&W; and municipal council and is officially dualistic, that is they have separated responsibilities. ==Municipal competences== Dutch municipalities do not have a delineated set of competences. In most competences the municipalities have an executive function, executing policy which is made at the national or provincial level. Legally municipalities have an \\"open household\\" which means that it can take on any competence it wishes as long as it does not violate national policy or break constitutional bounds. The municipality competences, often shared with national and provincial government include: *Land management, specifically local zoning laws *urban development *transport and local infrastructure *social affairs, employment and welfare *economy and the environment *education ==Finances== The municipalities get most of their finances from the national government. Partially through the municipal fund in which the national government puts part of its tax income. This money is divided evenly over the municipalities, which can spend it as they see fit. Moreover, municipalities receive earmarked budgets from the national government, with which the municipality can take care of specific competences such as social security. Municipalities can also levy their own taxes. The most well known is the onroerendzaakbelasting, a tax on home and building ownership. They also tax tourists and people who own dogs. Municipalities also receive administrative payments from citizens who need particular services such as environment permits. ==Civil Service== All twelve provinces have their own civil service. The head of the provincial civil service is the municipal secretary. ==References== Category:Politics of the Netherlands * Category:Local government in the Netherlands ","title":"Municipal politics in the Netherlands"},{"id":"19352811","text":"The Chestnut Tree is a short film which made its debut at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and then showed in the Austin Film Festival and the San Diego Asian Film Festival.

John Downes, in his Roscius Anglicanus (1708), reported that Anne Marshall was among the initial group of actresses employed by manager Thomas Killigrew with his King's Company when the company made the move to Gibbon's Tennis Court in 1660. Anne was revered for her roles in tragedies but was also known to play in breeches roles, wherein she would be playing a woman dressed as a boy. She had been nominated as possibly the \\"first English actress,\\" the Desdemona in the performance of Othello on 8 December 1660.Elizabeth Howe,The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660-1700, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; p. 24.Rosamond Gilder, Enter the Actress: The First Women in the Theatre, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1931; p. 166. [See: Margaret Hughes; Katherine Corey.] Marshall certainly played Desdemona in later performances. She excelled in rhymed heroic tragedy, creating ‚Äúexcessively grandiose heroines which so delighted Restoration audiences.‚ÄùRosamond Gilder, Enter the Actress: The First Women in the Theatre, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1931; p. 167. Marshall is thought to have played Zempoalla in the Dryden/Howard collaboration The Indian Queen in 1664. Reportedly, she did wonderfully but her voice was not as sweet as Mary Betteron's. She is known to have played the following roles with the King's Company: * Celia in Jonson's Volpone * the Lady in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady * Evadne in The Maid's Tragedy * Margarita in Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife * Edith in Rollo Duke of Normandy * Celia in The Humorous Lieutenant * Almeria in Dryden's The Indian Emperour * Mrs. Double-Diligence in Wilson's The Cheats * Celestina in Sir William Killigrew's The Siege of Urbin. Anne Marshall married an actor named Peter Quin, or Gwyn, sometime after June 1665. Peter Quin was wanted by the police for acting without a warrant. She resumed her stage career as Mrs. Quin once the theatres re-opened after the plague epidemic and the Great Fire of 1665-66\\\\. When she returned in November 1666 she was treated as a newcomer. She quarreled with the management about her private dressing room with a chimney, which had been taken from her, and she got it back in May 1667. She played: * Candiope in Dryden's The Maiden Queen * Aurelia in An Evening's Love * Alizia Pearce in Boyle's The Black Prince. Marshall retired from the stage in 1668; but she resumed her career nine years later, this time with the rival Duke's Company under Thomas Betterton. With that troupe, her first role was Angelica Bianca in Aphra Behn's The Rover in March 1677. (Coincidentally, Marshall had been cast in the same role in the abortive all-female production of Thomas Killigrew's Thomaso in 1664.) She also played: * Lady Knowell in Behn's Sir Patient Fancy * Lady Squeamish in Otway's Friendship in Fashion * Queen Elizabeth in Banks's The Unhappy Favourite * Sunamira in Southerne's The Loyal Brother -- and other parts.Wilson, All the King's Ladies, pp. 168-70. Anne Marshall had a younger sister, Rebecca Marshall, who joined her sister in the King's Company a few years after and was also a noted actress.J. H. Wilson, \\"The Marshall Sisters and Anne Quin,\\" Notes and Queries, New Series, Vol. 4 (March 1957), pp. 104-6. Their father, Stephen Marshall, was a clergyman, the chaplain of Lord Gerard.Deborah Payne Fisk, \\"The Restoration Actress,\\" in: A Companion to Restoration Drama, Susan Owen, ed., London, Blackwell, 2001; p. 75. Samuel Pepys mentions both Marshalls frequently in his Diary. The sisters played together at least once, in The Maiden Queen. ==See also== *Catherine Coleman ==References== Category:English stage actresses Category:17th-century English actresses Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Anne Marshall"},{"id":"19352831","text":"WHSM may refer to: * WHSM-FM, a radio station (101.1 FM) licensed to serve Hayward, Wisconsin, United States * WCBN (AM), a radio station (910 AM) licensed to serve Hayward, Wisconsin, which held the call sign WHSM from 1957 to 2017 ","title":"WHSM"},{"id":"19352832","text":"Wonderful Smith (June 21, 1911 - August 28, 2008) was an African-American comedian and actor from Arkadelphia, Arkansas. ==Early and personal life== Wonderful Smith was born in 1911 in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, to parents Sam Smith, Sr., a farmer, and his wife Mattie. Smith left home to go to Los Angeles at the age of 16. According to his obituary in the Los Angeles Times, Smith married three times but had no children. ==Hello, Mr. President== As a comedian, he was most notable for his routine, \\"Hello, Mr. President\\" which was an imaginary conversation with American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that lampooned the New Deal and World War II preparations. The routine appeared in Duke Ellington's satirical revue \\"Jump for Joy\\". No complete copy of the routine exists, although most of the routine appeared in the 1941 movie Top Sergeant Mulligan, performed by Smith, and was later re- released on the Smithsonian's Jump for Joy LP in 1988. ==Radio== He was a member of Red Skelton's radio shows in the early and mid-1940s. Others in the cast during this time were Ozzie and Harriet Nelson. When Smith returned from his World War II service, he found that his role in the show had been changed, along with the program's format. Smith claimed racial and veterans' discrimination. The radio show's sponsor responded that his contract had been honored because, while his role in the show was smaller than it had been previously, he was not written out with his contract paid off. ==Television== Smith also made numerous appearances as an extra in various television series and movies, such as the head chef in The Bold Ones: The New Doctors and a stage hand in the cavernous backstage scene in This is Spinal Tap. ==Personal appearances== Smith was a member of the \\"Wild\\" Bill Davis musical trio, which also included Davis and \\"Crazy Chris\\" Columbus. The group disbanded in 1956, and Smith became part of a larger group, the Swingin' Gentlemen, headed by Columbus. ==Legacy== Smith was the inspiration for the name of a Chicago-based indie rock group. ==Partial filmography== *Top Sergeant Mulligan (1941) - Wonderful *Over My Dead Body (1942) - Wonderful *Howzer (1973) *A Piece of the Action (1977) - Daniel McLean *Oh, God!

Diana d'Andal√≤ was born into a powerful Roman family in Bologna, Italy in 1201. Nothing is known of her childhood,Vann, p. 4 but she was described as \\"rather spoiled\\". She was \\"of outstanding beauty\\", charming, eloquent, well- educated, high spirited, courageous, and had good judgment. Dominican scholar Gerald Vann also called her \\"full of the joy of living, full too of the joy of her own beauty and the power it gave her\\". In 1218, Diana heard the Dominican scholar and preacher Reginald of Orl√©ans speak in Bologna. His sermons inspired her to give up her \\"worldliness\\" and devote herself to prayer. Following Reginald's advice, she remained at her family's home and continued to wear the clothes appropriate to her standing, although she wore an iron chain and hairshirt under them.Vann, p. 4 In 1219, St. Dominic came to Bologna; he received her vow of virginity and she proclaimed her intention to join the Dominican order as soon as a convent was established in Bologna.Vann, p. 5 She persuaded her father to purchase the lands to build a convent, but he refused to allow her to enter it, probably because the family intended that she marry into another prominent family, and the bishop denied permission to build on the site chosen. In 1222, she ran away to an Augustinian convent in Ronzano. Her family forcibly retrieved her and brought her back home; one of her ribs was broken, an almost fatal injury from which she never fully recovered. St. Dominic died shortly afterwards, but after she recovered from her injuries, she again escaped to Ronzano in 1223, although her family did not come after her a second time.Vann, p. 8 Shortly after St. Dominic's death, Bl. Jordan of Saxony, Dominic's successor, met Diana when he came to Bologna. With his assistance, Diana reconciled with her family, her father agreed to allow her to enter religious life, and the bishop agreed to another site for the convent. In 1223, St. Agnes in Bologna was established, and Diana entered the Dominican order. Four other nuns were also brought from the convent of St. Sixtus at Rome, including Cecila Cesarini, who was made prioress, and Bl. Amata; the three are always associated together.Vann, p. 14 Diana remained at St. Agnes until her death in 1236, and was buried there, along with the remains of Cecilia and Amata. Their relics were moved several times, but always together. Diana's head was place in a reliquary near the tomb of St. Dominic. Her feast day is June 9. She, along with Cecilia and Amata, were beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. Blessed Diana is known for a series of letters written to her and to the other sisters at St. Agnes by Jordan of Saxony; 37 of the 50 letters that have survived were written directly to her.Vann, p. 11 They are \\"evidence of the deep friendship shared by Diana and Jordan and demonstrate the possibility of warm affection\\" between priests and the cloistered nuns that pray for them and their work. The letters are also a record of the early history of the Dominican order. Gerald Vann, author of the book To Heaven with Diana!, a compilation of the correspondence between Diana and Jordan, calls the letters \\"a wonderful treatise on Christian friendship\\".Vann, p. 42 ==References Works cited == * Vann, Gerald (2006).

They were chronicled in Henrik Poulsen's book 77: The Year of Punk and New Wave. Billboard credited them with paving the way for 1980s new romantic acts. ==History== The band was formed in November 1976 by vocalist Rikki Sylvan (whose real name was Nicholas Condron) and guitarist Valac Van Der Veene, joined shortly afterwards by keyboardist Nik Weiss, bassist Andy Prince (also called Andy Prinz) and drummer Nigel Bartle. In May 1977, Bartle was replaced by Hugh Inge-Innes Lillingston. The band were managed by Frank Case. Although the band seemed to be working class (a stereotypical characteristic for punk musicians), they had a middle-class (or even upper-class) upbringing. Sylvan lived in Kensington and went to public school, Prince lived with his parents in Addlestone and Weiss went to public school. The son of a lieutenant commander, Inge-Innes Lillingstone lived in Thorpe Hall, near Tamworth, and attended Eton School. The band's official live concert debut was at The Man in the Moon in Chelsea on 28 May 1977. A single called Oundle RocSoc, containing early versions of \\"City of the Damned\\" and \\"Dorian Gray\\") was recorded at Tin Pan Alley Studio and released in May 1977. In the late summer of 1977, the band signed with DJM Records, and a new, re-recorded version of \\"City of the Damned\\" was released as a single in November. In January 1978, the band released the single \\"Loaded\\", backed with a cover of the Rolling Stones' song \\"Street Fighting Man\\"). That May, \\"Twilight Jack\\" was released as a single, but failed to chart. Shortly afterwards, they released their 4 Minute Warning album, which according to one critic was \\"roundly ignored\\". While the band were recording a second album at the CBS studio in London, they were dropped by DJM and split up shortly afterward. Their records generally received bad reviews in the British press. Later, Sylvan mixed Gary Numan's albums Replicas (with Numan's previous band Tubeway Army) and The Pleasure Principle. He also released a solo album, The Silent Hours, and then formed a band called 3AM with Steve Wilkin (guitar) and Derek Quinton (drums), both ex-members of Neo. Van Der Veene became a journalist, interviewing new wave icons. Prince joined Random Hold, but also worked with his ex-bandmate Sylvan in the 1980s. == Legacy == According to AllMusic: \\"When the history of the new wave finally started to get written, Rikki and the Last Days of Earth were conspicuous by their absence. No one remembered; nobody cared. Yet without them, a lot of what is now taken for granted about the early '80s might never have occurred\\". ==Discography== Studio albums * 4 Minute Warning (May 1978, DJM Records) Singles * Oundle RocSoc (May 1977, self-released) * \\"City of the Damned\\" (November 1977, DJM Records) * \\"Loaded\\" (January 1978, DJM Records) * \\"Twilight Jack\\" (May 1978, DJM Records) * \\"Tokyo\\" (September 1978, DJM Records) ==References * punk77.co.uk - discography * titsymina - discography Category:English punk rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1976 ","title":"Rikki and the Last Days of Earth"},{"id":"19352939","text":"Alfred Faist Rosenheim, F.A.I.A. (June 10, 1859 - September 9, 1943) was an architect born in St. Louis, Missouri and a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was one of the leading architects in Los Angeles, California in the early part of the 20th century. His major works include the Hellman Building, the Hamburger Department Store, Second Church of Christ Scientist and the Eugene W. Britt House. ==Education and early career== Rosenheim was born to a Jewish family in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of immigrants from Germany. After attending public schools in St. Louis, he studied in Frankfurt am Main, Germany from 1872 to 1875. When he returned from Germany, Rosenheim was a student at Washington University in St. Louis from 1876 to 1879. He next attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from 1879 to 1881. Rosenheim began his career as a draftsman working for Charles K. Ramsay of Boston from 1881 to 1883. In early 1884, he joined the practice of Major Francis D. Lee, then the leading architect in St. Louis. When Major Lee died in 1885, Rosenheim took over the practice. In 1894, he formed a partnership with T.C. Link and William B. Ittner that lasted until 1897. From 1897 to 1899, he worked in a partnership with his younger brother, Samuel F. Rosenheim, with Alfred working in Boston and Samuel in St. Louis. During this time, the Rosenheim firm designed Farragut Chambers, a ten-story apartment house in Washington, D.C., and various structures in Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1899, Rosenheim returned to St. Louis, where he remained until 1903. ==Works== Hellman Building Hellman Building In 1902, Rosenheim received a commission from Herman W. Hellman to design the Hellman Building, which was to be the largest steel-frame building in Los Angeles. He moved to Los Angeles in February 1903 to personally oversee its construction, which continued until November 1904. The impressive eight-story structure located in the heart of the city's new financial district established Rosenheim's reputation in the young city. The Architect and Engineer of California wrote that the building \\"universally is considered the finest architectural monument in Los Angeles,\\" built at an unprecedented cost of $1 million. The structure was built with a full steel skeleton frame, concrete floors and metal partitions. Hamburger‚Äôs Hamburger Dept. Store Following his work on the Hellman Building, Rosenheim was hired by A. Hamburger & Sons Co., to design and oversee the construction of their gigantic Hamburger Department Store, a five-story building at the corner of Broadway and Eighth Street. Hamburger‚Äôs later became the downtown May Co. Building, the largest department store in the Western United States when it opened. Additional commissions followed in Los Angeles, where Rosenheim built his practice and remained for the rest of his life. Second Church of Christ, Scientist Second Church of Christ, Scientist Another landmark Los Angeles building designed by Rosenheim is the Second Church of Christ, Scientist, a large domed church built in 1907 in the West Adams district. Other works He also designed Clune's Broadway Theater, the Majestic Theater (on the east side of Broadway between Sixth and Seventh Streets), the Chapman block (at the southeast corner of Fifth and Los Angeles streets), and the buildings occupied by the Farmers & Merchants Bank and the Security-First National Trust and Savings Bank. Clune's Broadway Theater, as shown in the Los Angeles Times, July 17, 1910 Rosenheim also designed many palatial homes for the city's wealthy, including a home for Edward L. Doheny in Beverly Hills, the Reeves residence in West Adams, the Eugene W. Britt House in West Adams, and the Judson C. Rives mansion in Westchester Place. The brick mansion he designed as his own residence in 1910, located at 1120 Westchester Place, was considered \\"one of the finest homes in Los Angeles.\\" Eugene W. Britt House Rosenheim's last major commission was the Hollenbeck Junior High School in 1937. The Hollenbeck school was a departure for Rosenheim, considered \\"modern\\" by many at the time. Rosenheim was reluctant to acknowledge the school as modern and wrote the following in the April 1939 issue of The Architect and Engineer: > \\"I do not consider the buildings particularly 'modern' although the > administration and assembly hall units may possess something akin to the so- > called 'contemporary' style. Personally, I do not hesitate to express the > fervent hope that 'modernistic' architecture is not a permanent trend. I > have a strong feeling that the bulk of modern work we see the country over > has very little claim to architectural beauty. In fact I am inclined to > doubt whether it can strictly be regarded as architecture. ...

After several years serving as the Secretary of the Los Angeles Municipal Arts Commission, Rosenheim was removed following a widely publicized scandal in 1921. After the commission rejected a proposal by a jeweler to erect an ornamental clock on the sidewalk, Rosenheim offered, for a fee of $250, to prepare drawings that he could \\"safely guarantee\\" would be approved by the commission. The Rosenheim-drafted plans were then approved at a special meeting of the commission held in Rosenheim's office on a Saturday morning. Rosenheim insisted he had done nothing improper, but the City Council unanimously voted to remove him, and the local branch of the American Institute of Architects recommended a term of suspension from its ranks. Rosenheim died of heart disease at California Hospital in 1943 at age 84. He was survived by his wife, Ruth. ==References== Category:1859 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Architects from St. Louis Category:Architects from Los Angeles Category:American Jews ","title":"Alfred Rosenheim"},{"id":"19352947","text":" SS Greenville Victory was a cargo Victory ship built in 1944, during World War II under the Emergency Shipbuilding program. The ship‚Äôs United States Maritime Commission designation was VC2-S-AP3, hull number 18 (V-18). Post-war she was acquired by the U.S. Army and renamed as USAT Greenville Victory. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1950, renamed USNS Greenville Victory (T-AK-237) and assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) who operated her safely through the Korean War and Vietnam War campaigns. She was the lead ship in her class of 9 ships that were transferred to the MSTS in 1950. She returned home with two battle stars to her credit and was struck in 1987. ==Victory built in California== Greenville Victory was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Los Angeles, California; 21 March 1944; launched 28 May 1944; sponsored by Miss Mary J. Vukov; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 8 July 1944. ==World War II operations== During the remainder of the World War II, SS Greenville Victory served as a merchant ship under charter to Sea Shipping Company of New York City. She served in the Pacific War, participating in the Battle of Okinawa. In Okinawa from 27 May 1945 to 19 June 1945 she supplied goods as a cargo ship and used her deck guns to defend herself and other ships from attacks.WW@ Battle StarsMARINERS, THE WEBSITE OF THE MARINERS MAILING LIST. VICTORY SHIPS ==U.S. Army service== Following World War II, she transported cargo in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean as the USAT Greenville Victory. She was transferred to the Army Transportation Service in the spring of 1948. Acquired by the Navy 1 March 1950, she was assigned to MSTS as a (T-AK-237). ==Korean War era service== Manned by a Maritime Commission civilian crew, Greenville Victory, from 1950 to 1953, operated in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean, carrying military cargo to French, English, and German ports; Guantanamo Bay; and the Panama Canal Zone. Between 19 February and 9 May 1953, she sailed out of New York City to the Far East and back, loaded with ammunition for Korea. After completing a run to Europe and back, she again departed New York 9 July 1953 for the Far East. She reached Yokohama, Japan, 9 August and during the next 2 months operated in the Western Pacific Ocean, carrying ammunition to Formosa and to French forces fighting Communist Viet-Minh guerillas in French Indochina. Sailing from Yokohama 4 1953 October via San Francisco, California, she reached New York City 6 November 1953 to resume cargo runs to Europe. ==Services at the world's poles== Greenville Victory during Operation Deep Freeze in 1956. During the next 2 years, Greenville Victory steamed primarily between New York City and West European ports. In June and July 1954 she sailed to the Western Mediterranean to replenish at-sea ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet. On 16 November 1955, she departed Newport, Rhode Island, for Antarctica and arrived at McMurdo Sound 16 January 1956 to provision ships of Task Force 43, as part of the Navy's Operation Deep Freeze. Departing Antarctica on 5 February 1956, and traveling via New Zealand, she arrived in New York on 28 March. Before the operation her hull was strengthened for Arctic ice conditions. Between 1956 and 1964 Greenville Victory maintained a busy schedule transporting cargo to American bases scattered throughout the world. She replenished Task Force 43 on three more Antarctic deployments; and, from December to February 1956‚Äì57, 1957‚Äì38, and 1960‚Äì61, she operated in Antarctic waters. Cargo runs sent her to the Caribbean in 1958, 1960, and 1962 and to Thule, Greenland, during September and October 1958. She also deployed with the 6th Fleet five times between June 1956 and March 1964. On two deployments in 1963 and 1964 she transited the Suez Canal, steaming to India and Pakistan. Greenville Victory departed Norfolk, Virginia, 6 October 1964 to participate in the massive transatlantic trooplift exercise, \\"Steel Pike I.\\" Departing Morehead City, North Carolina, 8 October, she closed the Spanish coast off Rota 19 October. For more than 2 weeks she discharged supplies and cargo in support of amphibious and shore operations. Departing Rota 7 November, she steamed via Morehead City to New York, arriving 20 November. ==Vietnam War era service== Greenville Victory departed New York 22 November 1964 for duty in the Western Pacific for the Vietnam War. Sailing via San Diego, California, she arrived Guam 24 December. During the next month she steamed to Okinawa, Korea, and Japan, carrying cargo. Arriving at Manila, Philippines, on 26 January 1965, she sailed the 28th for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, California. After reaching the U.S. West Coast on 25 February, she made a run out of San Francisco, California, to Seattle, Washington, then sailed for the U.S. Gulf Coast on 15 March, arriving New Orleans, Louisiana, on 28 March 1965. During the next 5 months, Greenville Victory made cargo runs in the Atlantic out of Norfolk, Virginia, and New York. She departed New York 20 October 1965 after a voyage to Labrador and back. Steaming via Norfolk, Virginia, and Long Beach, California, she reached Yokohama, Japan, on 22 November 1965. Loaded with military cargo, she sailed for South Vietnam 30 November and arrived at Saigon 16 December. The following day she sailed via V≈©ng T√†u for the U.S. West Coast, arriving San Francisco 3 January 1966. Greenville Victory replenished her holds with military supplies before returning to the Western Pacific. Sailing via Sasebo, Japan, she reached Bangkok, Thailand, on 13 February 1966. She sailed 22 February for South Vietnam and arrived V≈©ng T√†u the next day. Having unloaded, she sailed 1 March 1966 for the U.S. West Coast to transport additional military material from the United States to South Vietnam. She continued operations between the United States and the Western Pacific until transferred to the Atlantic at mid-year. In 1967 she was busy supplying NATO forces in Europe. In the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 the ship took onboard over 5400 South Vietnamese refugees. On 12 May 1975, six of the USNS Greenville Victory crew volunteered to help the recovery of the SS Mayaguez.

Built by the Confederate States Army between November 1861 and February 1862, it was the first exclusively military railroad.Johnston, p.35 Ultimately, the Centreville Military Railroad reached a point near a modern McDonald's restaurant on Virginia State Route 28, south of the modern junction with U.S. Route 29 in Virginia. ==Background== Centreville encampment Main street, Centreville, VA. May 1862 Gen Joseph E. Johnston faced a Federal force superior in size, while his own Confederate Army of the Potomac was spread thinly across central Fairfax County, Virginia, at Minor‚Äôs Hill, Flint Hill, Pohick, Accotink, Annandale, Munson‚Äôs Hill and Mason‚Äôs Hill. To prepare a better defensible position, he concentrated his troops on the Centreville Plateau, the high ground between Little Rocky Run and Bull Run along the western edge of Fairfax County, with his main supply base at the Manassas Junction in his rear in Prince William County, Virginia. The Centreville Plateau is located about north of Manassas Junction (modern Manassas, Virginia). The Confederates built an elaborate series of connected forts and military positions, and the Confederate cavalry and advanced pickets and vedettes controlled the countryside as far east as Fairfax Courthouse. The army went into camp and built winter quarters in Centreville which were protected by strong fortifications. The logistics of supplying 40,000 Confederate troops on the front lines grew worse with wet weather in October, so they withdrew even more into Centreville. Behind the lines, warehouses were built at Manassas Junction. Chapman (Beverly) Mill in Thoroughfare Gap, at the border of Prince William and Fauquier counties, also served as a supply depot. Over one million pounds of meat were stored there in the winter of 1861-62 to feed the Confederate Army of the Potomac.Candendquist, CWEA Tour Logistics problems As winter approached the wagons hauling supplies from Manassas Junction up the old Centreville Road turned the roadway into muddy mire.Johnston, p.35 By October 19, 1861, the Centreville Road had been planked to help alleviate this problem, but with no success. By early November, Quartermaster Major Albert Marle discovered that the ox teams being used to haul the wagons were eating too much fodder to make the logistics operation practical.Candenquist ==Construction== The idea of building a railroad, using spare and captured parts, became a viable option to ox carts and wagon teams on the muddy Centreville Road. However, on November 7, 1861, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad (O&ARR;) disapproved a request to using any of their rails to build such a line.Johnston, p.35 Private McClellan of the 9th Alabama Infantry Regiment commented in his diary on November 23 that 50,000 men were working on a railroad in shifts of six hours per day, causing them to have no time for working on winter huts. By November 30, 1861 newspaper articles reported two months would be necessary to build the planned railroad.Candenquist, CWEA Tour Construction began in December from the O&ARR; tracks at Manassas Junction.Johnston, p.35Netherton p. 68 On December 14, 1861, the newspapers reported that the new line was fully surveyed, was being leveled and that the line would run to Bull Run and then beyond that to the rear of the army. The rails, by order of Captain Thomas R. Sharp, were brought in from warehouses where they were being held in storage in Winchester, Virginia by wagon down to Strasburg, Virginia, and then by rail car to the Manassas Junction. \\"It is no mystery that the iron for the track came from the South's one unfailing source of supply in 1861, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\\"Johnston, pp.35-36 A deserter from the 6th Louisiana Infantry, who left Centreville on January 7, 1862 reported that 300 men were working on the railroad project. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency confirmed on January 27, 1862, based on the report of a deserter that the railroad construction was in progress. By February 5, 1862 the construction was still proceeding, but no ballast was being used, as is typically needed for drainage and stability of rail beds, and the ties were being spaced a twice the normal spread. It is estimated that the railroad was probably not finished before the first week of February, 1862, but was in successful operation as early as February 17, 1862.Candenquist, CWEA Tour ==Design== The rail line designed used long lazy-S curves, paralleling west along the old Centreville Road.Johnston, p.36 It ran , crossing Liberia Plantation, then across a new special trestle bridge constructed on Bull Run. It ran another north of Bull Run and finished in a terminus on level fields at Mertoff Farm. The gauge is presumed to be narrow gauge, matching the O&ARR; and Manassas Gap Railroad, which it spurred from, and used T-rail acquired from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad during raids. ==Operation== Trains, pressed into service from the Orange and Alexandria Railroad ran on the line from Manassas Junction from about the second week of February, 1862 until March 11, 1862 when Confederate forces withdrew southward. Supply operations begin While the railroad was exclusively designed only for resupply of the army, on a temporary and light track, an issue soon arose about the transportation of heavier loads of sick soldiers. Initially the locomotives used were under-powered for hauling large loads of sick soldiers and General Johnston did not allow use of the trains for transporting the sick. Later, larger locomotives were brought in and Johnston changed his mind, allowing evacuations of the sick south to the large Confederate hospital located in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Orange and Alexandria Railroad company disagreed with Johnston‚Äôs decision and actions, but were over-ridden by order of Johnston to Major Barber to transport the sick all the way to Charlottesville. On March 1, 1862 Major Barber issued orders to Captain Thomas Sharp regulating the operations of the railroad, specifying the types of loading for sick, for lady passengers, supplies, baggage, and requiring daily reports. Federal reaction Federal soldiers examining the earthworks from a distance came to believe the defenses at Centreville were virtually impregnable. The Confederate defense line along Bull Run appeared too strong to Major General George B. McClellan, the Federal officer charged with the responsibility of capturing Richmond after Major General Irvin McDowell had failed in July, 1861. McClellan identified another route to Richmond that would bypass the Bull Run defenses - sail the Union Army down the Potomac River to Fortress Monroe, then march up the Peninsula past Williamsburg to Richmond. Operations end The operation of the railroad was very short lived, as General Johnston decided on March 9, 1862 to abandon his defensive positions on the Centreville Plateau and move south of the Rappahannock RiverJohnston, p. 36 to counter Major General McClellan‚Äôs movements to Hampton Roads, Virginia. On March 11, 1862, the Confederates quickly abandoned their positions, tore up as much track as possible, leaving much of the rail lying in place, and destroyed the trestle bridge across Bull Run. Federal troops entered and occupied the area on that same dayCandenquist, CWEA Tour and decided to rip up and \\"use the slightly worn rails for repairs elsewhere in Virginia.\\" ==Aftermath== On May 7, 1862, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&ORR;) began trying to recover property from the abandoned rail line after making an inspection trip on April 30. The B&ORR; claimed that their rails were uniquely identifiable, and knew they had been stolen during Virginia Militia and Confederate operations as part of the Great Train Raid of 1861. However the Federal quartermaster made a decision on May 20 to take of inventoried and captured Confederate rail from this railroad and use it on other needed Union Army rail projects. The following day, B&ORR; President John W. Garrett send a letter of protest regarding the intended Federal re- use, having found out that the Union Army planned to use the rails to repair the Manassas Gap Railroad for help in resupplying Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks in the Shenandoah Valley.Johnston, p.36 Quickly taking action, the B&ORR; provided a full report with a detailed description of their property on May 24. The Union Army replied on June 7 that it intended to keep and use the rails, and President Garrett again responded on June 9 that he absolutely needed the rails for the more serious need of repairing the B&O; rail line to restore services there, which were more vital to overall Union Army needs. The Union Army finally complied with Garrett‚Äôs request and by the end of July 1862 the rails of the Centreville Military Railroad were all returned to the original rightful owners, the B&O; Railroad. \\"Once its rails were removed virtually all traces of the world's first military railroad were speedily obliterated by undergrowth. For all but a very few its brief existence was soon forgotten.\\" ==NotesReferences== * Candenquist, Arthur, The Great Train Robbery - or The Confederates Gather Steam, Winchester, Virginia, CWEA, August 2008, 17-page pamphlet for historical field tours through the Civil War Education Association *Hanson, Joseph Mills, Bull Run Remembers: The History, Traditions, and Landmarks of the Manassas (Bull Run) Campaign Before Washington, 1861-1862, National Capitol Publishers, Inc., 1957 ISBN B0007DRPR6 * Johnston II, Angus James, Virginia Railroads in the Civil War, University of North Carolina Press for the Virginia Historical Society, 1961. *Netherton, Ross D., In the Path of History: Virginia between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, Ruth Preston Rose, 1986.

It was founded in 1971, with close ties to the Religious Studies program at the University of Lancaster. That program was founded and chaired by Ninian Smart, and he served as the Chairman of the first editorial board. Four companies have published the journal over the years: Oriel Press (1971‚Äì72), Routledge & Kegan Paul (1973‚Äì80), Academic Press (1981‚Äì2000), Elsevier (2001‚Äì2010), and currently Routledge. Religion publishes academic work on all issues of Religious Studies, including the history, literature, thought, practise, material culture, and institutions of particular religious traditions from a variety of perspectives such as social scientific, humanistic, cognitive, economical, geographical, etc. (but excluding work that falls purely within the areas of theology or philosophy of religion). The journal has European and North-American editors (currently Michael Stausberg and Steven Engler) and a multi-national Editorial Board.Publisher site ==Abstracting and indexing== The journal is

(October 15, 1933Family Tree Legends William David Pearlman in Fresno, California,\\"His journey started in 1933 in Fresno California.\\" ‚Äì January 23, 2011obituary in The New York Times Retrieved January 28, 2011 in New Orleans, Louisiana) was a musician, raft builder and \\"free spirit\\" who lived his life outside expected norms. He has been called a modern primitive, a nomad, a permanent dropout, raftbuilder and musician.Kamiya, Gary. The Nomad The New York Times March 18, 2007. Retrieved January 24, 2011. ==Biography== Inspired by a documentary he saw when he was twelve years old, in which Australian aborigines periodically burnt their homes and walked away naked, free to start a new life, he taught \\"triadic thinking\\" and empowerment to people trapped by the concept of job and rent. Thus Poppa Neutrino built his own homes out of discarded materials on free space (public waterways) and supported himself as a street musician. He changed his name at the age of 52 after surviving a severe illness. Neutrino built several rafts out of donated and recycled materials on which he lived and sailed. In 1997-98 Poppa Neutrino sailed one of his homemade junk rafts, Son of Town Hall, from North America to Europe, becoming the second person to sail a raft across the Atlantic and the first to do so on a raft made from trash. Betsy Terrell, his wife, was the captain and navigator on the crossing. In 2008 Poppa Neutrino moved to Burlington, Vermont to build another raft, this time on Lake Champlain. In 2010, he planned a circumnavigation of the globe, leaving Burlington, Vermont to head first south to Florida with three sailors and their three dogs aboard a new craft, a 37-foot trimaran complete with two outboards, a heated pilot house and four cabins. However, on November 9 their raft was driven onto rocks on Thompson's Point, Charlotte, Vermont. Poppa Neutrino and his fellow rafters were rescued from Lake Champlain. Neutrino died on January 23, 2011, in a hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, of heart failure.Baird, Joel Banner. Burlington Rafter, Adventurer Poppa Neutrino Dies Burlington Free Press January 24, 2011. Retrieved January 24, 2011. Neutrino's jazz funeral was attended by dozens wearing bright costumes. Married \\"several times,\\" he had four children, as well as step- and adopted children. ==Books and films about his life== Poppa Neutrino's life and travels have been the subject of articles and books, including two by Alec WilkinsonWilkinson, Alec.The Crossing (Abstract) The New Yorker June 27, 2005.

These three stations are all well-known for their frequent traffic reports (every 15 minutes), although the music accounts for 90% of their daily programming, with ten songs per hour. ==Mexico== *

Michigan, is the largest university-based credit union in the world and is federally chartered and regulated under the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). MSUFCU provides a variety of financial products and services including deposit accounts, personal and business loans, investments, and insurance, among others. MSUFCU is owned by its membership and overseen by a board of directors elected by said membership. As of year-end 2019, MSUFCU has nineteen branches, over 280,000 members, more than $4.8 billion in assets, and over 900 employees. Branch locations can be found on MSUFCU‚Äôs website. ==History== In 1937, Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (MSCAAS) faculty and staff members founded the state-chartered Michigan State College Employees Credit Union (MSCECU). Being a state-charted credit union means it fell under the regulatory authority of Michigan‚Äôs division of financial services. The Credit Union was created with a mere $3,000 in assets, a desk drawer to operate out of at MSCAAS‚Äôs administration building, and a singular goal: to help members achieve their dreams. In 1955, the State of Michigan renamed Michigan State College as Michigan State University, and MSCECU adjusted its name to become Michigan State Employees Credit Union. The Credit Union moved to the Power House Plant on MSU's campus the following year. To better serve members who lived near MSU‚Äôs satellite campus in Oakland County, another Credit Union branch was opened there in 1967. In 1971, the Credit Union relocated its main office across MSU‚Äôs campus in East Lansing, Michigan from the Power House Plant to 600 E Crescent Road, as its membership and assets continued to increase. A branch in Auburn Hills, Michigan was opened in 1973. The Credit Union was state chartered until 1978 when the NCUA approved the Credit Union's application for federal charter, effectively changing its name to MSU Federal Credit Union. By that time, MSUFCU had grown to $40 million in assets and 29,244 members. In 1983, MSUFCU‚Äôs Okemos branch was added. This branch was relocated to its current location on Central Park Drive in 2003. The East Lansing branch was constructed on East Grand River Ave across from MSU‚Äôs campus in 1987. The Credit Union continued to grow in the early 2000s with the West Side Lansing branch opening in 2003, the South Lansing branch in 2005, and the MSU Union branch on MSU's campus in 2006. MSUFCU continued to expand by opening a new headquarters building at 3777 West Road in East Lansing in 2008. The building was constructed using green building standards and received a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. In April 2011, MSUFCU expanded into downtown Lansing with a new branch located on Washington Avenue, a convenient location for the many workers of downtown Lansing, including State of Michigan employees. In March 2012, the third MSU campus branch opened on Mount Hope Road and in September of the same year, another branch was opened on Marsh Road in Haslett, Michigan. To help better serve Sparrow Hospital employees, patients, and visitors, an MSUFCU branch was opened within the Lansing Sparrow Hospital Professional Building in January 2013. Effective April 2013, MSUFCU merged with former Eaton County Educational Credit Union (ECECU). MSUFCU acquired one branch location in Charlotte, Michigan, from the merger. In May 2014, construction began on MSUFCU's Meridian Crossing branch, which is located on Jolly Road in Okemos, Michigan. And in September 2014, MSUFCU opened a branch in Mason. In November 2014, the Credit Union announced a new $46 million, 186,350 square-foot building expansion to the existing headquarters campus. The second headquarters building houses a call center, information technology department, and other member service departments. The second building on MSUFCU‚Äôs headquarters campus celebrated its grand opening in October 2017, coinciding with MSUFCU‚ÄôS 80th anniversary. In March 2015, after 41 years of service with the organization, Patrick McPharlin retired as President/CEO of MSUFCU. April Clobes became the Credit Union‚Äôs next and current President/CEO. Throughout her 18-year tenure with the Credit Union, April held titles such as Vice President of Marketing and eCommerce, Executive Vice President, and Chief Operating Officer, among other roles prior to becoming President/CEO. In April 2016, MSUFCU merged with Clarkston Brandon Community Credit Union (CBCCU), headquartered in Clarkston, Michigan, which allowed MSUFCU to add five southeast Michigan counties (Oakland, Genesee, Lapeer, Livingston, and Macomb) to its field of membership. Along with the merger, two more Oakland County branches were acquired: Clarkston and Ortonville. A branch in downtown Grand Rapids opened in fall 2017, allowing the Credit Union to expand westward. MSUFCU will open a branch in Holt, Michigan, and relocate its existing Clarkston branch on Ortonville Road to a new location on Sashabaw Road in 2020. MSUFCU is also planning to open two locations in Traverse City. Throughout the years, MSUFCU has grown sizably but its values remain the same: helping members and employees achieve their goals and dreams; volunteering with and donating to charitable organizations in the communities it serves; offering financial education; and providing superior service. In 2017, MSUFCU announced a $5.5 million donation to MSU to support ten university programs over the course of five years. Each year, $1.1 million would be donated to support the Broad Art Museum, College of Arts and Letters, College of Business, College of Communications Arts and Sciences, College of Music, College of Social Science, Residential College in Arts and Humanities, Science Gallery, Wharton Center, and WKAR. Beyond this donation, MSUFCU‚Äôs employees raise and donate upwards of $200,000 each year for local charities through various fundraisers. In April 2019, MSUFCU founded the Desk Drawer Fund, which is a foundation supporting the MSU and OU communities focusing on five philanthropic pillars: arts and culture, stable housing, empowering youth, financial education, and fostering entrepreneurialism. Donations to the foundation can be made here. MSUFCU maintains its commitment to its members, employees, and communities, and continues to grow and build upon the foundation that was laid more than 80 years ago by the eight faculty and staff members who built their dream from a desk drawer. ==Oakland University Credit Union (OU Credit Union)== MSUFCU began its partnership with Oakland University in the late 1950s after Alfred and Matilda Wilson donated $2 million and their 1,500-acre estate to Michigan State University to start a new college in Oakland County. MSUFCU provided financial services to the university employees at that time and continued to serve the OU community after Oakland University became its own entity. In January 2014, MSUFCU strengthened its partnership with OU by becoming the official credit union for the university under the trade-name of Oakland University Credit Union (OU Credit Union). To enhance the OU community‚Äôs experience with the Credit Union, a branch was opened in Oakland University‚Äôs Oakland Center to serve OU students, faculty, staff, and community members on campus and campus ATMs were converted to OU Credit Union ATMs. ==Membership== MSUFCU provides financial services to the MSU and OU communities, their families, and hundreds of Select Employee Groups (SEGs), including State of Michigan employees, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), and Quality Dairy, among many others. MSUFCU also offers services to anyone who lives, works, worships, goes to school, or owns a business in Oakland, Genesee, Lapeer, Livingston, and Macomb Counties. ==Products and Services== MSUFCU offers products and services to meet members‚Äô every need. MSUFCU offers many ways for members to access their accounts and speak to an MSUFCU employee remotely: ComputerLine (an online account management system), mobile app, Live Chat, eMessages, and Call Center. MSUFCU members can also perform a wide range of transactions free of charge at nearly 30,000 CO-OP Network ATMs nationwide. MSUFCU‚Äôs contact hours can be found here. ==Recognitions== MSUFCU has a national reputation for excellence and has received several top industry and workplace awards. Among those are being named Best Workplace in Financial Services and Insurance by Fortune Magazine, receiving the ATHENA Award¬Æ for Organizational Leadership, and being named one of West Michigan‚Äôs Best and Brightest to Work For several years in a row. MSUFCU has been certified as a Great Place to Work¬Æ for five consecutive years, and was named as a Top Workplace in the large employer category by the Detroit Free Press for six years in a row, as of 2019. In 2019, it was recognized as one of CU Journal‚Äôs Best Credit Unions to Work For. In 2014, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions recognized MSUFCU as the Federal Credit Union of the Year. Additional MSUFCU recognitions can be found here. ==References *Official website *Branch Locations *National Credit Union Administration's CU Online tool‚Äîprovides many financial and organizational details Category:Banks established in 1937 Category:Credit unions based in Michigan Category:Michigan State University Category:Economy of Lansing, Michigan Category:1937 establishments in Michigan Category: East Lansing, Michigan ","title":"Michigan State University Federal Credit Union"},{"id":"19353136","text":"The following radio stations broadcast on FM frequency 105.3 MHz: ==Argentina== * Am√©rica in Paran√°, Entre R√≠os * Blue in La Plata, Buenos Aires * Del Buen Ayre in Bella Vista, Buenos Aires * El Signo in Rosario, Santa Fe * Espacio in Huangel√©n, Buenos Aires * Estaci√≥n del siglo in Rio Grande, Tierra del Fuego * La 100 Santa Rosa in Santa Rosa, La Pampa * La 105 in Villa Mar√≠a, C√≥rdoba * Q in Alta Gracia, C√≥rdoba. * Radar in Humboldt, Santa Fe. * Regi√≥n in G√°lvez.

It was located at Jameson Avenue and Springhurst Avenue in the former village of Parkdale. It was demolished in 1911 as part of a grade separation engineering project. ==History== The original east-west rail line in the area was built in 1855 by the Great Western Railway (GWR). It connected Toronto to the east and Hamilton to the west, following the Lake Ontario shoreline, passing through the then-rural Parkdale area. By 1879, the population in the Parkdale area had grown and the GWR built the South Parkdale station. It was named \\"South Parkdale\\" to distinguish it from the existing Parkdale railway station at Dufferin Avenue and Queen Street, which was renamed \\"North Parkdale.\\" In 1882, the GWR was absorbed into the Grand Trunk Railway which took over the line and the South Parkdale station became a GTR station. From the west, the rail line climbed from the level of lakeshore up to Parkdale and then down again to enter the center of Toronto. Early in the 1900s, the GTR decided to eliminate the climb by making a cut from east of Dufferin Avenue to west of Dowling Avenue, along the existing railway right-of-way. Bridges over the new cut were constructed at Dufferin, Dunn, Jameson and Dowling streets to preserve access to the lake shore and Exhibition grounds. West of Dowling Avenue, the new rail line bed was raised from the previous waterfront level to make an even elevation from the Humber River east to Sunnyside, providing subways at several points to provide grade-separated access to the waterfront from the north. The project levelled the rails from Strachan Avenue all the way west to the Humber. South Parkdale station was demolished in 1911 as part of the grade separation project. A temporary station was constructed west of Jameson Avenue to serve during the project. In 1912, this second station was closed, and the passenger rail services were moved to the new Sunnyside station further west at Roncesvalles Avenue and Queen Street.

The team was led by head coach Mike DuBose, who was coaching his final season at the program. The Crimson Tide, also known informally as the Tide, played their home games at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Legion Field, in Birmingham, Alabama. The team entered the season trying to build upon a 10‚Äì3 record from their 1999 season, which included a 34‚Äì7 victory in the SEC Championship over the Florida Gators. The 2000 team would not have the same success. Despite a preseason #3 ranking they eventually finished with a 3‚Äì8 record (3‚Äì5 in the SEC). The 2000 season was filled with several close losses. A 30-28 loss at LSU was the Tide's first loss to LSU in Baton Rouge in 31 years, ending a 14‚Äì0‚Äì1 streak Alabama had posted there since 1969. A 9-0 defeat at the hands of in-state rival Auburn came on a cold and rainy afternoon and marked the first Iron Bowl played in Tuscaloosa since 1901. For the first time since the 1956 season Alabama failed to win any out-of-conference games and became the first team from an AQ conference to lose to Central Florida, falling 38-40 at home on a last-second field goal. On November 1, Athletic Director Mal Moore announced that Mike Dubose would resign at the end of the season. ==Schedule== *Source: Rolltide.com All-time Football Results: 2000 Season ==RankingsGame summaries== UCLA The Preseason hype at Alabama was through the roof as the reigning SEC Champions came into a match up against UCLA ranked third in the country. Despite that, Alabama was physically dominated by UCLA offense as they pulled off the upset. Vanderbilt Alabama would use an eighteen point 4th quarter to pull away and beat Vanderbilt for the 16th straight time. This would be the last conference game Alabama would play at Legion Field. Southern Miss Alabama would be shut out for the first time since 1997 as Southern Miss used a pick six and a scoop and score to beat Alabama at Legion Field for the first time since 1990. After the game, Mike Dubose offered his resignation to Mal Moore but, was rejected by Moore. Arkansas Despite having the lead for the majority of the second half, Arkansas 13 play, 80 yard drive capped off by a 9 yard touchdown pass from Robby Hamilton to Marcellus Poydras with 1:04 to go gave Arkansas the lead and the eventual win. South Carolina Milos Lewis had two critical 4th quarter interceptions that allowed Alabama to hold on the beat #23 South Carolina. The win kept Alabama's perfect record against South Carolina all time (10-0). Ole Miss Alabama's 45 points are the most of any team in a game under Mike Dubose and the most for any Alabama team since 1993 in a rout of Ole Miss. Tennessee For the 6th year in a row, Tennessee found a way to beat Alabama extending their longest win streak against the Crimson Tide. This match up was the first time both teams came into the game not ranked since 1988. UCF Alabama could not overcome 5 turnovers as a Javier Beorlegui 37 yard field goal gave UCF the upset win on Homecoming for Alabama. This was the 2nd time under Mike Dubose that Alabama had lost its Homecoming game. On the Wednesday following the game, Mike Dubose was informed that he would not return as Head Coach in 2001. Coach Dubose was allowed to remain as Head Coach until the end of the season. LSU For the first time since 1969, Alabama lost at Tiger Stadium behind 16 fourth quarter points from LSU after Alabama had taken the lead at the beginning of the 4th quarter. Alabama scored with seven seconds left to cut the lead to two but, failed to recover the onside kick. This lost guaranteed Alabama second losing season under Mike Dubose and third since 1957. Mississippi State Alabama gave up a season high 538 total yards of total offense as Mississippi State beat Alabama for the third straight time in Starkville. Auburn For the first time since 1901, the Iron Bowl would be played in Tuscaloosa and the first time ever at Bryant Denny Stadium. However, freezing rain, sleet, and Damon Duval's three field goals would spoil the return as Auburn would shut out Alabama for the first time since 1987. This would be the last game for Mike Dubose as Head Coach and would be the last time to date Alabama has been shut-out. This along with the Southern Miss shut out earlier in the season, would be the first time Alabama has been shut out more than once in a season since 1957. ==References== Alabama Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football seasons Crimson Tide ","title":"2000 Alabama Crimson Tide football team"},{"id":"19353199","text":"Jos√© Ilich Rodr√≠guez (born December 18, 1974) is a former professional baseball pitcher.

Marins is best known for the Z√© do Caix√£o (Coffin Joe) film series. The film is a sequel to Marins' 1971 film The End of Man (Finis Hominis), in which the character of Finis Hominis, an influential, messianic culture figure turns out to be an escaped mental patient. Rather than the horror themes which Marins was noted for, the film, like its predecessor, is low budget black humored social satire. In this film, Finis Hominis (after returning to the asylum) again feels the need to escape the asylum in order to put right the world's increasing social unrest that he sees in the news. ==Plot== Finis Hominis is a mental patient who is kept in an insane asylum, and is known for his occasional escapes from the institution, including the most recent episode during which Finis Hominis became a powerful world figure during the few days of his escape. Again hospitalized, he sees in the news increasing social, religious, and political unrest in the world, and again feels the need to escape the institution to put order in the streets. He wanders through society, influencing and interfering in isolated incidents, correcting wrongs and exposing corruption primarily in a strictly accidental or coincidental manner. There is also a parallel sub-plot regarding the impending closure of the asylum due to the cessation of funding from an anonymous benefactor. ==Cast== *Jos√© Mojica Marins *Andr√©a Bryan *Rosalvo Ca√ßador *Maria Cristina *Nivaldo de Lima *Sabrina Marquezine *Palito *Amires Paranhos *Walter C.

The Kings play in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was founded as the Rochester Royals by Lester Harrison and his brother Jack Harrison in Rochester, New York in 1945. The Royals won the National Basketball League (NBL) championship during their inaugural season by defeating the Sheboygan Red Skins 3‚Äì0. In 1948, the team joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which merged with the NBL to become the NBA a year later. The franchise won its first NBA championship in the 1951 NBA Finals under the coaching of Lester Harrison. The Harrison brothers moved the team to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1957 due to poor attendance. After spending 15 years in Cincinnati, the team was purchased by a group of businessmen from Kansas City, who moved the team to Kansas City and renamed it to the Kings in 1972. The team was briefly named the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975 when home games were split between two cities. In 1982, the franchise was bought by a Sacramento-based group and became the Sacramento Kings. There have been 28 head coaches for the franchise since joining the NBA. Rick Adelman is the franchise's all-time leader in regular season games coached (624), regular season games won (395), playoff games coached (69), and playoff games won (34). Phil Johnson and Cotton Fitzsimmons have won NBA Coach of the Year in the and season, with the Kings respectively. Harrison, Bobby Wanzer, Ed Jucker, Bob Cousy, Draff Young, Jerry Reynolds, Reggie Theus, and Kenny Natt have spent their entire NBA head coaching careers with the Kings. Wanzer, Tom Marshall, Jack McMahon, Cousy, Larry Staverman, Adelman and Theus formerly played for the Kings.

He was a 1993 Pew Fellow. He writes a column for The Unz Review. ==Biography== Dinh came to the US in 1975, lived in Philadelphia and in 2018 is moving back to Vietnam. In 2005, he was a David Wong fellow at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, England. He spent 2002‚Äì2003 in Italy as a guest of the International Parliament of Writers and the town of Certaldo. He was a visiting faculty member at University of Pennsylvania. From 2015‚Äì2016, Dinh was the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the University of Leipzig's Institute for American Studies in Leipzig, Germany. ==Career== He is the author of two collections of stories, Fake House and Blood and Soap, and five books of poems: All Around What Empties Out, American Tatts, Borderless Bodies, Jam Alerts, and Some Kind of Cheese Orgy. His first novel, Love Like Hate, was published in October 2010 and won the Balcones Fiction Prize. His work has been anthologized in Best American Poetry 2000, Best American Poetry 2004, The Best American Poetry 2007, and Great American Prose Poems from Poe to the Present. The Village Voice picked his Blood and Soap as one of the best books of 2004.

He is a Holocaust denier, writing that ‚Äúthe elaborate Holocaust myth...

There is hope for Palestinians, however, for as the USA implodes, Israel will also go up in smoke. Working in tandem, the US and Israel have collapsed several Muslim governments and generated millions of refugees. The same fate awaits Israel, though its dissolution should be permanent, for only then will peace come.\\" He has suggested that ‚Äúin every field besides sports, entertainment and politics, blacks are failing spectacularly against all other races,‚Äù writing that ‚Äúduring segregation, blacks [...] were self-sufficient, because they had to be.

He opened a bikini shop and ran it for the next 40 years. ==Launching the bikini== R√©ard was an automotive engineer who took over his mother's lingerie business in about 1940 and became a clothing designer near Les Folies Berg√®res in Paris. While on Saint Tropez beaches, he noticed women rolling up the edges of their swimsuits to get a better tan, which inspired him to design a swimsuit with the midriff exposed. In May 1946, Jacques Heim produced a two- piece swimsuit that he named the \\"Atome,\\" which he advertised as the world's \\"smallest bathing suit\\". The bottom of Heim's swimsuit was just large enough to cover the wearer's navel. To promote his new design, Heim hired skywriters to fly above the Mediterranean resort advertising the Atome as \\"the world‚Äôs smallest bathing suit.\\" R√©ard quickly produced his own swimsuit design which was a string bikini consisting of four triangles made from only of fabric printed with a newspaper pattern. When R√©ard sought a model to wear his design at its debut presentation, none of the usual models would wear the suit, so he hired 19-year-old nude dancer Micheline Bernardini from the Casino de Paris to model it. He introduced his new swimsuit, which he named the bikini, to the media and public in Paris on 5 July 1946 at Piscine Molitor, a popular public pool in Paris at the time.Bikini Introduced , This Day in History, History Channel He introduced his design four days after the first test of a nuclear weapon at the Bikini Atoll. The newspapers were full of news about it and Reard hoped for the same with his design. Not to be outdone by Heim, R√©ard hired his own skywriters to fly over the French Riviera advertising his design as \\"smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world.\\" Photographs of Bernardini and articles about the event were widely carried by the press. The International Herald Tribune alone ran nine stories on the event. Fourteen days later, R√©ard applied for a patent for his design, and was awarded patent number 19431. Two piece swimsuits had been available for at least since the 1930s, but R√©ard's bikini was controversial because for the first time the wearer's navel was exposed. ==Marketing of the bikini== The bikini was very popular, especially among men, and Bernardini received some 50,000 fan letters. Heim's design was the first worn on the beach, but R√©ard's name for it stuck in the public consciousness. R√©ard's business soared, and in advertisements he kept the bikini mystique alive by declaring that a two-piece suit wasn't a genuine bikini \\"unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.\\" As a further booster for sales, R√©ard commissioned carbody specialist Chapron to build an extravagant \\"road yacht\\" by converting a Packard V8 car into a mock luxury cabin cruiser complete with cockpit, portholes, anchor, signal mast and other nautical regalia. The car (not an amphibian) went on advertising parades and followed the Tour de France cycliste in the early 1950s, with a crew of bikini clad girls, causing quite a sensation in period parochial France.Le Bikini ==Later life== R√©ard afterwards opened a bikini shop in Paris and sold swimsuits for 40 years. In 1980, R√©ard moved with his wife, Marcelle R√©ard, from France to Lausanne, Switzerland. He died in Lausanne in 1984 at the age of 87. ==Notes * Category:1897 births Category:1984 deaths Category:French fashion designers Category:Bikinis Category:Date of birth unknown ","title":"Louis R√©ard"},{"id":"19353609","text":"Creature Features a classic horror film show broadcast in the New York Metropolitan Area, on WNEW, Channel 5 (Metromedia Broadcasting). It was hosted by Lou Steele (The Creep), who became familiar to Channel 5 viewers for starting off the 10 o'clock News by asking: \\"It's 10 p.m.; do you know where your children are?\\" ==History== Creature Features first aired from July to August 1969 on a test run, and was found to be a hit. The movies broadcast were taken from the classic horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s, the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s, British horror films of the 1960s, and the Japanese \\"giant monster\\" movies of the 1960s, and early 1970s. It was continued on the air from November 1969 to August 1973, but was cancelled due to poor ratings and competition from WPIX's Chiller Theatre. ==The movies== Creature Features normally showed classic Universal Horror, like Dracula, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, plus many Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi films and others. They also aired all the movies produced and distributed by American International Pictures. This included all the Roger Corman B-movies of the 1950s and 1960s like The Raven, and The Terror, plus most of the Japanese \\"monster movies\\" produced by Toho Studios, and Daiei Motion Picture Company (famous for their Godzilla and Gamera movies). They also broadcast all the best British horror films by Hammer Film Productions, like The Quatermass Xperiment, The Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula: Prince of Darkness, The Phantom of the Opera, The Curse of the Werewolf, and The Hound of the Baskervilles. Also Amicus Productions, and Tigon British Film Productions films such as Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, and The House That Dripped Blood. But what became most well known about Creature Features is the airing of all the 1950s science fiction movies. These included Them!, The Thing from Another World, It Came from Outer Space, It! The Terror from Beyond Space, The War of the Worlds, and Forbidden Planet. ==Seasons== The following is a checklist and brief broadcast history of the Creature Features horror movie showcase: *Promo Season ** July‚ÄìAugust 1969 (7:30pm Saturday) *1st Season ** November 1969 ‚Äì September 1970 (8:30pm Saturday) *2nd Season (Double Feature) ** October 1970 ‚Äì September 1971 (12:00 Noon, 8:30pm Saturday) *3rd Season ** November 1971 ‚Äì June 1972 (8:30pm Friday) *4th Season ** July‚ÄìSeptember 1972 (7:30 Friday) *5th Season (Double Feature) ** October‚ÄìSeptember 1972 (12:00 Noon, 11:30pm Saturday) *6th Season ** October‚ÄìDecember 1972 (12:00 Noon Saturday) *7th Season ** January‚Äì March 1973 (8:30pm Saturday) *8th Season ** April‚ÄìJune 1973 (12:00 Noon Saturday) *9th Season (Double Feature) ** July‚ÄìAugust 1973 (12:00 Noon, 8:30pm Saturday) In late 1973 Creature Features was dropped from its nighttime slot and replaced by football games and other programming (although the Saturday's horror movies continued with Chiller Theater). When horror movies eventually returned to Saturday night, they would usually air in a late night timeslot. The daytime version, during the second and fifth seasons, was usually entitled \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" (with a cartoon figure metamorphing into a troll-like monster a la Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde). Creature Features would resurface at odd intervals, specifically during 1976‚Äì1978, but none of these runs lasted for very long. Lou Steele, The Creep himself, died of a heart attack in February 2001. ==1979-1980 re-broadcast== In November 1979, Channel 5 began rebroadcasting some of the old Creature Features shows. Instead of airing in its old 8:30 p.m. slot, Creature Features became a late night showcase, showing a triple feature with each airing. The first movie went out under the familiar Creature Features name, the second movie was Son of Creature Features and the third film was shown as Revenge of Creature Features. Once again poor ratings and competition with WPIX caused its cancellation in May 1980. ==Lou Steele== Unlike other horror hosts, Steele didn‚Äôt utilize any ghoulish make-up or trappings, instead striking a somewhat sinister/hipster attitude with sunglasses and harsh lighting. Among various contests and gimmicks during the show's run was \\"Creature Quotes\\", in which individual words of a longer phrase (\\"A stitch in time saves Frankenstein\\", \\"Don't get chummy with the Mummy\\") were flashed momentarily on the bottom of the screen at various times during the movie. ==Intro music== The intro music for Creature Features was Herman Stein's \\"Visitors from Space\\" from the score of the 1953 film It Came from Outer Space. The track was most likely taken from the 1959 Dick Jacobs LP, Themes from Horror Movies (Coral 757240). ==See also== * Creature Features Syndicated show ==External links== * Creature Features in New York * * Web page with audio of 1959 WNEW-TV sign-off by Lou Steele * 1983 video clip of Lou Steele announcing, \\"Did you hug your child today?\\" Category:Creature Features Category:Culture of New York City Category:1960s American television series Category:1970s American television series Category:1969 American television series debuts Category:1973 American television series endings ","title":"Creature Features (1969 TV series)"},{"id":"19353641","text":"Antonio Burks (born 30 May 1982) is an American professional basketball player who played for the Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada.

XI‚ÄìXIII), Doctoral Thesis (University of Seville), 136‚Äì37. The battle was the high point of a series of struggles for power between the Lara and Castro families following the death of Sancho III of Castile in August 1158 and the accession of his young son, Alfonso VIII.Barton, 154. In 1159 the Lara had seized the regency from Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro, Fernando's uncle. Early in 1160 Fernando had been forced into exile at the court of Ferdinand II of Le√≥n. According to Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, writing in the early thirteenth century, he returned shortly with an army and inflicted a major defeat on his enemies, led by Nu√±o P√©rez de Lara, brother of the young Alfonso's regent, Manrique, at Lobregal in the Tierra de Campos, near Villabr√°gima. The Anales toledanos primeros, under the year 1160, note an arrancada led by Nu√±o P√©rez in the Tierra de Campos.Arrancada de D. Munio en Campos en el mes de Marcio, Era MCXCVIII (\\"Violent incursion of Don Nu√±o in the Tierra de Campos in the month of March, year 1198 of the Spanish Era\\"), in Enrique Fl√≥rez, Espa√±a Sagrada (Madrid: 1767), XXIII, 391. An arrancada could refer to \\"as much to a violent incursion, in the style of a chevauch√©e, as to a military action that ends in serious defeat.\\"S√°nchez de Mora, 158: Arrancada puede significar tanto una incursi√≥n violenta, al estilo de la cabalgada, como una acci√≥n militar que termina en estrepitosa derrota. Nu√±o's brothers Manrique and √Ålvaro may have been present at the battle also. In the battle, Fernando's father-in-law, Osorio Mart√≠nez, died fighting alongside the Lara.S√°nchez de Mora, 136, dates Osorio's actual death to the middle of 1161. He further (p. 441) opines that the peace that followed Lobregal allowed Osorio to marry his daughter Constance, repudiated by Fernando, to the Leonese knight Pedro Arias. Fernando also captured Nu√±o P√©rez and Rodrigo Guti√©rrez. Rodrigo's brother, √Ålvaro Guti√©rrez, died on the field. The captive Lara leaders were released within a few days after swearing an oath to Fernando that they would return after burying √Ålvaro. Once free Rodrigo promptly placed √Ålvaro in a sarcophagus, but delayed his burial, believing this exempted him from returning to captivity.S√°nchez de Mora, 158. Nu√±o met Fernando at Due√±as with a following of six hundred knights. Under such circumstances Fernando did not dare attempt to take him captive again, and Nu√±o claimed he had upheld his end of the agreement. The Cr√≥nica General de 1344 records that Manrique, who in fact died at Huete four years later, had died on the field of Lobregal and that it was Nu√±o who received his freedom from captivity for the purpose of burying his brother.S√°nchez de Mora, 159. This confusion is shared by several other late sources. Their victory did not allow the Castro to wrest control of Alfonso VIII from the Lara, but it did strengthen their position at the court of Ferdinand II of Le√≥n, to which they had fled. On 13 March both Fernando and his brother √Ålvaro confirmed a Leonese charter. They were also able to return to Castile by 11 July, when the confirmed a charter of Alfonso VIII alongside the three Lara brothers and their uncle, Gutierre Fern√°ndez, indicating a peace accord by that date. The Castro brothers had returned to the Leonese court by at least September, but they did not confirm Ferdinand II's only charter issued in November that year. It appears that a general peace followed the Battle of Lobregal. There is no record of further armed conflict in 1160, but in 1162 Ferdinand II took Toledo from the Castilians and in 1164 the Castro defeated the Lara again at the Battle of Huete. ==Notes== Lobregal Category:Battles in Castile and Le√≥n Category:Conflicts in 1160 Category:1160 in Europe Category:12th century in Castile Category:History of the province of Valladolid ","title":"Battle of Lobregal"},{"id":"19353685","text":"The Illusionist may refer to: *The Illusionist (Johnston novel), a 1995 novel by Jennifer Johnston *The Illusionist (Mason novel), a 1983 novel by Anita Mason *The Illusionist, a translation by Herma Briffault, of Le Rempart des B√©guines, by Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris *The Illusionist (1983 film), a Dutch comedy film *The Illusionist (2006 film), an American period film set in Vienna *The Illusionist (2010 film), a French-British animated film *\\"The Illusionist\\" (song), a 2006 song by Swedish metal band Scar Symmetry *\\"The Illusionist\\", part of \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" by Friedrich Nietzsche *The Illusionists, a touring magic production ","title":"The Illusionist"},{"id":"19353713","text":"Roxanna Maude Brown (May 2, 1946 ‚Äì May 14, 2008) was a prominent authority on Southeast Asian ceramics and director of the Bangkok University's Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum.Rooney, Dawn F. 2008. \\"Roxanna Brown (1946-2008)\\".

WorldCat Arrest and death While employed as a curator by Bangkok University, she became involved in the investigation of the smuggling of art objects from Thailand to the United States, particularly from the Ban Chiang cultural tradition, assisting U.S. Government agents. However, she was herself implicated in the possible false authentication of stolen objects, based on material found during January 2008 raids on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, California, the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California, and the Mingei International Museum in San Diego. Brown was arrested on May 9, 2008 for alleged wire fraud when she arrived in the United States to deliver a lecture at an Asian art symposium at the University of Washington. She was found dead in her cell at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac on May 14. Naturally, the charge was dropped immediately after her death at the facility. The question of her actual involvement in the smuggling ring, the justification for her arrest, and her lack of medical attention after it, was the subject of a series of articles in the Los Angeles Times. Medical malpractice lawsuit A medical malpractice lawsuit was filed by her son, Taweesin (Jaime) Ngerntongdee, after it was determined that Brown had died of peritonitis caused by a perforated ulcer. The suit claimed she had suffered stomach problems in the detention center and that other inmates took her to a shower after a guard would not respond when she vomited something that \\"smelled like excrement.\\" When Brown requested for help after the 10 p.m. lockdown on May 13, the guard told her she would have to wait until the morning for medical attention, according to the suit. Detention center officials acknowledged there was no overnight medical staff on duty and took the case to mediation. The federal government settled the case for $880,000 in July 2009. Attorney Tim Ford stated part of the settlement stipulated that Brown's death would be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. == Books == She was author of a number of academic books on Southeast Asian ceramics.

Breen. The lyrics tell of a cowboy's love for Mary, the \\"Pride of the Prairie\\". ==Recordings== The song was first recorded by popular singer Billy Murray in 1908. Later recordings include versions by many country and folk acts, including Aaron Campbell's Mountaineers, Tex Owens, and Patsy Montana. ==Historical significance== Botsford wrote the music for the song while working for a publisher in New York, where he met Breen incidentally. It wound up launching his career as a composer, as its success resulted in securement of a contract with J. H. Remick & Co., for whom he later wrote 1908's Black and White Rag, which sold over 200,000 copies. Like many Western-themed songs produced by Tin Pan Alley around the time, the song capitalized on the trends of a time when farming was beginning to take off in the Western United States. In addition, its release came one year after the introduction of the Ford Model T, and accessibility to long-distance travel spurred the advent and popularization of cowboy tourism. Sales reflected this popularity, as the sheet music sold over 300,000 copies. Early recordings of the song were not by country or folk singers, but mainstream East Coast singers such as Billy Murray. Historian Jim Walsh called the song \\"one of the best of all cowboy songs\\". ==Lyrics== The lyrics to the chorus are: :Pride of the prairie, Mary my own, :Jump up beside me, ride to my home :My heart's been lassoed, :No more we'll roam, :Pride of the prairie, Mary. :(repeat)Breen, \\"Pride Of The Prairie\\" (Sheet music). ==ReferencesBibliography== *Breen, Henry J.

All competitions are based on a promotion-relegation system of advancement, as outlined below. Openage (Senior) Competition There are two concurrent tiers of competition in Victoria - Premier League/Vic League and Pennant/Metro. There are 19 rounds of competition in the premier league and premier league reserves, other competitions are 18 rounds. In 2012 the competition was renamed from State League one to Premier League. With a change from 10 teams to 12 teams in the competition. Diagram of the openage competition structure  Premier League Competition  In 2008, there were five State League grades for men and four for women. There is a maximum of ten teams per grade in State League. If a new club was to enter State League, they would have to enter at the lowest grade and earn promotion to the higher grades. Clubs may only enter one team in the Premier League (PL), and this is treated as that club's \\"First XI\\" or highest-ranked team. Premier League (PL) is the premier competition in Victoria. After the renaming to Premier League at the end of 2012, the competition for premier league has two grades \\"Premier League\\" and \\"Reserves\\". A club playing in premier league automatically has a team in reserves. The number of clubs in premier league in 2019 is sixteen. To gain promotion to premier league a club must satisfy League Entry Criteria published by Hockey Victoria. The lowest team on the ladder in premier league is subject to demotion. {  +Premiership Winners Premier League !Year !Men !Women - 2019 Southern United Hockey Club Hawthorn Hockey Club - 2018 Southern United Hockey Club Hawthorn Hockey Club - 2017 Camberwell Hockey Club Hawthorn Hockey Club - 2016 Camberwell Hockey Club Hawthorn Hockey Club - 2015 Greensborough Hockey Club Doncaster Hockey Club - 2014 Greensborough Hockey Club Hawthorn Hockey Club - 2013 Camberwell Hockey Club Greensborough Hockey Club }  Pennant / Metro Competition  Clubs may have one team in each grade of Pennant/Metro competition. They progress by earning promotion from lower grades to higher grades. Grades are typically limited to 10 teams per grade, although Metro may have fewer teams depending on team entries for that year. Pennant grades are statewide, but Metro grades are district-based to minimise travel distances. The Pennant/Metro grades are ranked as follows: # Pennant A # Pennant B # Pennant C # Pennant D # Pennant E # Pennant F #Pennant G (men's competition only) # Metro A (Location/Zone based ) # Metro B (Location/Zone based # Metro C (depending on the number of teams) Premier League and Premier League Reserves have a four-week final series as follows: * Week 1: ** 1st and 2nd Qualifying finals - 1st plays 4th and 2nd plays 3rd ** 1st and 2nd Elimination finals - 5th plays 8th and 6th plays 7th * Week 2: Semi Finals ** 1st Semi Final - Winner of the 1st elimination finals plays loser of 1st qualifying final ** 2nd Semi Final - Winner of the 2nd elimination finals plays loser of 2nd qualifying final * Week 3: Preliminary Finals ** 1st Preliminary final: Winner of 1st Qualifying final plays winner of 2nd semi final ** 2nd Preliminary final: Winner of 2nd Qualifying final plays winner of 1st semi final * Week 4: Grand final ** Winners of 1st and 2nd Preliminary final Pennant/Metro/Masters competitions have a three-week finals series as follows: * Semi-Finals - The teams finishing 1st and 2nd after the regular season play in the \\"Qualifying Final\\", and the teams finishing 3rd and 4th play in the \\"Elimination Final\\" * Preliminary Final - The loser of the Qualifying Final plays the winner of the Elimination Final * Grand Final - The winner of the Qualifying Final plays the winner of the Preliminary Final Teams finishing in the bottom two places of each pennant grade after the regular season are relegated to the next lowest grade in that competition. For example, the teams finishing 9th and 10th in PB will be relegated to PC for the next season. Teams being relegated from PD/PE to M1 will go to the most appropriate district of M1 if possible, with one team going to each district. Likewise for teams being relegated from M1 to M2. Teams finishing 1st in each grade after the regular season (the Minor Premiers) are automatically promoted to the next highest grade in that competition. If that team also wins the Grand Final (the Major Premiers) then the team finishing 2nd in the grade is promoted. If the Minor Premier is not also the Major Premier, then the Major Premier is promoted. For example, Teams A, B, C and D finish 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th in SL2 respectively. A is automatically promoted to SL1, and if A wins the Grand Final, B is promoted as well. If A does not win the Grand Final, the team that does win is promoted instead of B, regardless of where they finished. Only the Minor Premier of each district of M2 is promoted to M1, and likewise for M1 into PD/PE. Underage (Junior) Competition Competition in the Underage competition is based on age, gender and grade. HV operates competitions for age groups under-16, under-14, under-12. Competitions also exist for under-18 and under-10. Under 18 and Under 10 are not graded competitions. In each age group there are several grades, depending on team numbers, as follows: # 'A' or 'Shield A' #'B' or Shield B # Pennant North-West & Pennant South-East # (District) North & South As of 2020, competitions in Shield and pennant will be a girls competition and a boys competition, not mixed gender. District will be a mixed gender competition. There is a nominal limit of 10 teams per grade, but this is relatively flexible depending on team entries. Promotion is based on the performance of a club over a number of years, and is re-examined every year. For example, a team that finished on top of U14PNW may not necessarily be promoted to U16A the following year if that team are all top-age players (hence ineligible for U14 the next year) and the next group of players have performed poorly (for example the U14PNW team finished last in the same year). Age groups are taken from 1 January that year. For example, a player who is 13 on 1 January would be eligible for U14 and U16 grades. The A-grades have perpetual shields named after notable hockey personalities in Victoria: * U16A Mixed- Ric Purser Shield * U16A Girls - Ron Penpraze Shield * U14A Mixed - George Stapleton Shield *U14A Girls - Marg Tomlinson Shield * U12A Boys- Ron Ford Shield * U12A Girls - Ken Parkin Shield All junior grades from U12 to U18 play a two-week finals series as follows: * Semi-Finals - The teams finishing 1st and 4th after the regular season play in one semi-final, and the teams finishing 2nd and 3rd play in the other * Grand Final - The winners of the two semi-finals play each other Overage (Masters) Competitions There are three separate masters competitions - Men's (Over 35 and Over 45), Women's (over 35), Men's (over 50). Ages are taken as at 31 December that year. As for other competitions, 18 rounds are played and there is a limit of 10 teams per grade, except in the bottom grade. Diagram of the overage competition structure Grades for the over-35 and over 45 tier are ranked as follows: # Masters A # Masters B # Masters C (men only) # Masters D (men only) Over-50s are colloquially known as \\"SuperVets\\" and play in either A or B. Teams finishing in the bottom two places of each grade after the regular season are relegated to the next lowest grade in that competition. For example, the teams finishing 9th and 10th in VA will be relegated to VB for the next season. Teams being relegated from VB to VC will go to the most appropriate district of VC if possible, with one team going to each district. Teams finishing 1st in each grade after the regular season (the Minor Premiers) are automatically promoted to the next highest grade in that competition. If that team also wins the Grand Final (the Major Premiers) then the team finishing 2nd in the grade is promoted. If the Minor Premier is not also the Major Premier, then the Major Premier is promoted. Only the Minor Premier of each district in VC is promoted to VB. Indoor Competition Over summer HV runs an Indoor competition. There are competitions for men and women. There are also underage competitions for under-18, under-15 and under-13 boys and girls. A Victorian club championships for indoor is held each year. This runs in the age groups of Under 18, Under 15 and Under 13. ==Intra-State Championships== HV runs a number of intrastate tournaments throughout the course of the year. Junior State Championships Pre-2010 Held during the week leading up to the first weekend in July, this was the premier intrastate Championship in Victoria. It consisted of five representative zones competing in a round-robin competition in under-13, under-14 and under-15 age groups in boys and girls competition. U13 and U15 State teams (or final trial squads) were selected from this tournament. Likewise this was the selection tournament for officials such as umpires to attend National Championships. The competing zones were: * Western Wildcats - green and yellow uniform. Comprised Altona, Brunswick, Essendon, Footscray, Lowther Hall, Melton, MUHC and Werribee clubs * Eastern Hotshots - black and green uniform. Comprised Baw Baw, Camberwell, Knox, Hawthorn, MCC, MHSOB and Yarra Valley clubs * Southern Sharks - purple and white uniform. Comprised Casey, Greater Dandenong Warriors, Frankston, Mentone, Mornington Peninsula, Southern United, St. Bedes, TEM and Waverley clubs * Red Devils (North) - red and black uniform. Comprised Ajax-Maccabi, Box Hill, Doncaster, Greensborough, Kew and PowerHouse/St Kilda clubs * Country Cobras - navy blue and white uniform. Comprised all affiliated regional associations including Geelong, Bendigo, Albury-Wodonga, Ballarat, Warrnambool, and Gippsland. 2010 onwards At the completion of the 2009 JSC, there was significant speculation that the structure of the Championship would be radically changed. Later that year, HV announced that the number of zones would increase from five to ten (6 metropolitan and 4 regional) and that the structure of JSC would be modified to reduce the time over which it was played. The age groups were revised to be U13 and U15 (run concurrently at the same event in July) and U17 (run separately in October). This brings the State Championships into alignment with the Hockey Australia National Championships (the U17 event provides players that will be U18 in the following April, when the U18 nationals is usually held). The new zones are as follows: * Southern Sharks - Purple and White - Bayside, Casey, Chadstone, Frankston, Greater Dandenong Warriors, HMAS Cerberus, Mentone, Mornington Peninsula, Old Haileyburians, Peninsula, Sandringham Women, Southern United, Southern Knights, St Bedes * Central Flames - Red and Yellow - Elwood, Hawthorn, Maccabi, MCC, Melbourne High, Old East Malvern, Powerhouse/St Kilda, Swinburne, TEM * North East Red Devils - Black and Red - Box Hill, Doncaster, Greensborough, Kew, Marcellin, Old Carey, Old Trinity, Old Yarra Valley * Eastern Hotshots - Green, Red and Black - Camberwell, Collegians-X, ECHO, Knox, Monash Uni, Old Camberwell Grammar, Old Xaverians, Victorian Sihks, Waverley * North West Tigers - Orange and Grey - Brunswick, Caroline Springs, Essendon, LaTrobe, Lowther Hall, Melton, Melbourne Uni, Parkville, PEGS, St Bernard's, Yarra Valley, * Western Wildcats - Green and Yellow - Altona, Footscray, Geelong, Old Melbournians, RMIT, Sunshine, Werribee * Southwest Country Eagles - Maroon and Black - Ballarat, Corangamite, Glenelg, Grampians, Portland, Warrnambool, Wimmera * Gippsland Bulls (previously known as Southeast Country Cougars)- Blue and Red - Baw Baw, East Gippsland, West Gippsland, LaTrobe Valley * Northeast Country Knights - Green and Blue - Golbourn Valley, Albury-Wodonga, Euroa * Northwest Country Lightning - Blue and White - Central Victoria (Bendigo), Kerang, Maryborough, North-Central, Sunraysia, Wimmera U18 Women's State Championships Traditionally held over the Labour Day long weekend in March, this was a zone-based development tournament. There were typically 10 zone teams selected (Bayside, Central Suburbs, Western Suburbs, Western Highway, Outer Suburbs, Central State, Southwest Districts, Gippsland, Upper Murray, Murray Valley) and they competed in a round-robin phase, with a finals series on the Monday. Zone teams were selected from trials based on the senior club the players play for. This tournament was run for the last time in 2010, being replaced by the U17 State Championship (see above) Country Carnival Affiliated regional associations are invited to send teams to compete in the Country Champs. A senior & veterans competition is held over the Queen's Birthday long weekend in June, and a junior competition was held on the last weekend in June, immediately preceding the Junior State Championships. In 2012, the Junior Country Carnival was moved to the last weekend in May. This was done to enable regional zones to select their Zone teams for JSC at the event (providing two months for training between this event and the JSC in July). Umpires for JSC from 2012 are also to be selected based on performance at the Junior Country Carnival. VicStix A round-robin tournament is held at the conclusion of each VicStix development program, as a way for the participants to showcase the skills they have learned throughout the program. As VicStix is regionalised, it is straightforward to play each region off against the others. It is typically run during March. ==State Teams== HV enters state representative teams in all national championships run by Hockey Australia. These include: * Victorian Vikings and Vipers in the Australian Hockey League (AHL) * Under-21 * Under-18 * Under-15 * Under-13 (this was made a full Hockey Australia national championship in 2011, but was sanctioned by HA before then) * Country (open age) * Masters Additionally, indoor hockey teams are entered in: * open * U21 * U18 * U15 *U13 State Uniform The traditional colours of the state uniform are navy blue with white highlights, and the alternate colour (particularly used for socks) is orange. Kombat was the official uniform supplier of HV from 2003 to 2009, when Victorian-based Cramark took over the contract. Speculation amongst players was that Kombat was too expensive and too slow, and this local manufacturer could produce uniforms quicker and cheaper. This was short-lived, however, as it appears Cramark went out of business. Kukri is now the official uniform supplier, as it is for almost all of the other States and Territories and the Australian national teams. Under Kombat, the \\"Big V\\" (a white V shape on the front of the navy blue shirt, stretching from shoulder to navel to shoulder) was reserved only for Victoria's premier teams, the Vikings and Vipers. Cramark and Kukri have since introduced that design to all state teams from U15 upwards. The alternate is a white shirt with a blue V. ==Development Programs== HV has been involved in the implementation of its own statewide skills development program known as VicStix. It has also been active in providing affiliated clubs and associations with the tools to run the Hockey Australia-accredited HookIn2Hockey programs for primary-school-aged children, and Rookey programs for younger children. ==References * http://www.hockeyvictoria.org.au * SportingPulse Electronic Results System Category:Sports governing bodies in Victoria (Australia) Vic ","title":"Hockey Victoria"},{"id":"19353826","text":"Camp Callan was a United States Army anti-aircraft artillery replacement training center that was operational during World War II. It was located on the southern west coast of the United States, north of San Diego at La Jolla, California. The facility was closed shortly after the war ended and few traces of the base remain. ==Location and current use== Camp Callan was located near U.S. Highway 101, about north of downtown San Diego in the La Jolla area. It occupied a roughly rectangular piece of land approximately north-to-south and east-to-west. This land is on the Torrey Pines Mesa and is near the Pacific Ocean. The northern portion of the former base is today the 36-hole Torrey Pines Golf Course complex, opened in 1957, and the Torrey Pines State Reserve. The southeastern portion is now part of the University of California, San Diego campus. The rest of the southern portion of the former base includes private land (both residential and commercial), the Scripps Green Hospital and research institutes such as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. This portion of the former base is in the vicinity of present-day Genesee Avenue and North Torrey Pines Road. ==History== Acquisition On October 9, 1940, the San Diego City Council leased the U. S. military of land for a nominal one dollar per year. The city council also leased an additional to the military. Margaret C. Hawkins leased the military and F.T. Scripps, Inc. leased them . The military acquired by revocable permit from the city council and by license from the city council. Altogether, of land for the base was authorized for acquisition by the government. Early period of operation On November 22, 1940, the War Department announced plans to create a replacement training center for Coast artillery units in the Torrey Pines Mesa area. Men inducted into the military under the Selective Service Program would be assigned to this new training center. The purpose of this training center was to teach trainees how to fire long-range weapons in the event the Imperial Japanese Navy tried to attack the West Coast of the United States. This training center was named \\"Camp Callan\\" in honor of Major General Robert Emmet Callan, a distinguished Coast Artillery officer. Construction of the base began in November 1940 and official occupation of the camp was marked by a military flag-raising ceremony that took place on January 15, 1941. Twenty officers and one hundred and twenty enlisted men were present. They were all members of the first unit of operations personnel at the new base. Brigadier General Francis P. Hardaway was the new camp's first commander. He spoke on the importance of the camp to the defense program at this ceremony. On February 24, 1941, the first large guns arrived at the camp. Nine of these guns were French-made 155 mm guns that dated back to World War I. Around five thousand trainees arrived at the camp between the last week of February and the end of March. They arrived by rail at a nearby reopened railroad station. The first trainees came mostly from Fort Ord and Fort MacArthur in California, Fort Sheridan in Illinois, Fort Missoula in Montana and Vancouver Barracks in Washington. The first military review was held on April 2, 1941. Six thousand men passed in formation before Major General Joseph A. Green, Chief of Coastal Artillery. He congratulated them on the progress they had made in such a short time. Since the camp did not have its own military band, a 100-piece Marine Corps band provided music for this ceremony. Middle period of operation A period of significant change for the camp began in March 1942. The military had seen the terrible damage the Luftwaffe had inflicted on the United Kingdom so they decided to place full training emphasis on anti-aircraft weapons rather than on a combination of seacoast artillery and anti-aircraft weapons. This change marked the beginning of a two-year period of peak activity for the camp. Approximately fifteen thousand trainees were going through their training during each thirteen-week training cycle. Training ranges on the base included a 1,000-inch range, a 200-yard rifle range, a pistol range, an automatic weapons range and a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun range. The trainees learned to use 155 mm, 90 mm, 75 mm, and 40 mm caliber guns as well as the associated fire control equipment. Gun firing positions were established for this training. In addition to artillery gun positions and small arms ranges, a variety of other facilities and structures were built on the base. These improvements included barracks and cantonments, a 910-bed station hospital, offices, five Post Exchanges, three theaters, five chapels, support buildings, storage buildings and a landfill. In all, the developed part of the base covered twenty-three blocks and had over 297 buildings at this time. Various living amenities were provided for the health, general education and war training schooling of the trainees, much like other Army camps of the time. A weekly newspaper called The Range Finder and an annual pictorial review called The Callander were published at the camp. The camp eventually got its own 40-piece military band as well. Late period of operation Lt. Donald Prell wearing his WWII U.S. Army uniform in 2009 In the last group of recruits attending Coast Artillery basic training at Camp Callan, was Donald Prell, who in June 1944, graduated from OCS at Ft. Benning, GA. In June 1944, the training emphasis at the camp was again to change. The anti-aircraft training program was transferred to Fort Bliss, Texas and the camp assumed an important role in preparations for massive overseas amphibious assaults. However, this period of camp activity was short-lived. By May 8, 1945, the war was over in Europe and by August 15 the Japanese had surrendered. Because of these changes, this training was no longer needed. On November 1, 1945, Camp Callan was declared surplus. Disposal After the camp was declared surplus, the land it was on was disposed of over the course of a year. and an additional of leased land was cancelled on March 25, 1946. of leased land was cancelled on August 9, 1946. of leased land was cancelled on June 30, 1946. of permit land was cancelled on December 13, 1945. of licensed land was cancelled on March 25, 1946. The land under permit was released in lieu of restoration clause. The landfill was not on the permit land. After closing At the time the camp closed, Southern California was facing a shortage of lumber and building materials. This problem was made worse because many veterans chose to stay in San Diego after the war. In order to mitigate this problem, the San Diego City Council negotiated with the War Department to acquire most of the buildings and facilities of the camp (which numbered around five hundred at the time the camp closed). The selling price was $200,000. These material were then resold to veterans and other citizens at reasonable prices. Several thousand homes, several churches and many utilities were constructed from this material. The city recouped its $200,000 investment and made a $250,000 profit on these sales. Part of this profit went to build the Veteran's War Memorial Building in Balboa Park.

The bloodless engagement cost the Confederates 2,300 men and control of the Cumberland Gap. ==Background== Major General Ambrose Burnside, commander of the Department and Army of the Ohio, began to advance against Knoxville, Tennessee. Burnside left Cincinnati, Ohio in mid-August 1863. The direct route ran through the Confederate-held Cumberland Gap. Burnside had been delayed in earlier attempts to move out against Knoxville and thus chose not to spend the time to force a passage of the gap. Instead he detached one brigade under Colonel John F. DeCourcy to pose a threat to Brigadier General John W. Frazer's 2,300 man garrison, while the rest of the army bypassed to the south over 40 miles in rugged mountainous terrain.Korn p.101 DeCourcy had previously led a brigade in the 1862 operations against the Cumberland Gap under George W. Morgan. Despite this, Burnside made a rapid advance on Knoxville. Many of the Confederates in eastern Tennessee had been withdrawn for the upcoming Battle of Chickamauga, leaving only two brigades under General Sam Jones (including Frazer's). Having successfully occupied Knoxville on September 2, Burnside could now return his attention to the Cumberland Gap. ==Battle== Frazer and his 2,300-man garrison had little combat experience, yet they had the benefit of a strong natural defense. Frazer's men supplemented this by digging their own trenches. General Simon B. Buckner had given Frazer orders to hold the gap at all cost, yet when Buckner and all his troops were redeployed, no contingency had been formulated for retreat and therefore Frazer continued following his orders from Buckner to hold the gap. DeCourcy's brigade threatened the Confederates from the north, but his brigade alone was not enough to force Frazer out of the gap. Burnside dispatched a second brigade under Brigadier General James M. Shackelford. Shackelford approached from the south and, on September 7, asked for Frazer's surrender. There were still not enough Union troops to convince Frazer to surrender. An ineffectual exchange of artillery followed but that evening Union soldier captured Gap Springs, the Confederate water supply.William W. Luckett, Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. XXIII, No. 4, December 1964. On September 8 Burnside personally left Knoxville with a brigade under Colonel Samuel A. Gilbert and marched 60 miles in just over a day.Korn p.104 Meanwhile, both DeCourcy and Shackelford sent messages demanding surrender. Attempting to buy time, Frazer met with the two Union commanders separately, but rejected surrender demands from both. Around 10:00 a.m. on September 9, Burnside sent a message to Frazer stating he now had a large enough force to carry the gap by storm. The large Union force, little combat experience and low morale (after news of Vicksburg and Gettysburg) all factored into Frazer's decision to surrender. Around 3:00 p.m. Frazer agreed to an unconditional surrender of all the Confederates guarding the Cumberland Gap.Burnside's Official Report Between 100-300 men managed to escape through DeCourcy's lines after the surrender had taken place, but the rest of the soldiers, arms, 14 pieces of artillery and the strategic location were now in Union control. This was the last major operation against the Cumberland Gap and it would remain in Union hands for the rest of the war. ==Opposing Forces== Union Department of the Ohio - Maj. Gen. Ambrose E.

Set in modern-day New Delhi, India, it tells the story of a poor autorickshaw driver, Amal Kumar. The film was originally released as a short film in 2004, with the same lead actor but a mostly different cast, before it was readapted and expanded into a feature film three years later. ==Plot== Amal Kumar (Rupinder Nagra) is an honest, punctual, hardworking sweet-natured autorickshaw driver who has two regular customers: the store merchant Pooja (Koel Purie) and a schoolboy who is the son of exacting lawyer Sapna Agarwal (Seema Biswas). While riding in Amal's autorickshaw, Pooja has her handbag snatched out of her hands by a beggar girl (Tanisha Chatterjee). Amal pursues the girl until she is hit by a car. Amal and Pooja take the girl to hospital. Amal visits the girl regularly, speaks to her doctor and reminds the nurses to take good care of her. One day Amal offers his services to an old man, whose identity is revealed later in the film as local billionaire G.K. Jayaram (Naseeruddin Shah); Jayaram has been wandering the streets of New Delhi searching for an honest man. Jayaram asks Amal questions about his life, makes insulting comments about his driving skills, changes his destination, and finally pays the fare; he is surprised that Amal does not accept a three rupee tip. Jayaram subsequently dies, leaving his entire estate to the one honest man he believes to have encountered ‚Äì Amal. He dictates that his will is not to be read until Amal reports to Jayaram's lawyer, Sapna, who has no idea that Amal is her son's autorickshaw driver. If Amal is not found within a month, Jayaram's estate will be inherited by his family members. Sapna deploys Suresh (Roshan Seth), Jayaram's longtime companion, to find Amal, but Suresh and Jayaram's son Vivek hatch a plan to hinder the search in order to claim inheritance. In the meantime, although Priya's condition improves, she is in need of surgery that would cost 50,000 rupees. Amal sells his autorickshaw to pay for the surgery, but Priya dies on the operating table. Amal then takes a janitor position at a local post office. Touched by Amal's kindness and self- sacrifice, Pooja uses some of the money she has been saving for her dowry to buy a carburetor, which she gives to Amal so that he can fix up an abandoned auto-rickshaw lying by his house. Suresh finds Amal and witnesses his honesty and sweet nature first-hand. He is reluctant to notify Sapna, but finally does so the night before the deadline. When he informs Vivek that he is abandoning their original plan and is taking Amal to Sapna's the next day, Vivek attacks Suresh and chokes him to death. The next morning, Sapna reads Suresh's notes and finds out that Amal is her son's autorickshaw driver. She brings Amal into the house to sign some papers. Amal, who is still unaware of the inheritance, opens G.K.'s letter and takes a long look at it. Sapna receives a phone call and asks Amal to wait in the living room; she is told that Suresh has died. Amal leaves the lawyer's house so as not to be late in meeting Pooja. Out on the sidewalk, he is approached by a homeless girl who asks him for a piece of paper to draw on. Amal hands her the letter and drives away. The homeless girl approaches Sapna's son and tells him that the paper Amal has given her to draw on has writing on it and may be of some importance. Sapna's son replies that it would make no difference, as Amal cannot read. The movie ends with Amal picking up Pooja, the two smiling at each other, and a voiceover by G.K. saying that he could not imagine what the man who did not want three rupees would do with three hundred million rupees. ==CastScreening and reception== In 2007 the film was screened at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, winning the Best Narrative Award. It was shown at the 2008 Whistler Film Festival, where Rupinder Nagra received an award for Best Actor. Amal was nominated for six Genie Awards in 2009.

It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres. To score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and \\"scratch\\" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a Guitar Hero guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including DJ Shadow, Z-Trip, DJ AM, Grandmaster Flash, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Daft Punk, and Benny Benassi. DJ Hero was generally well received by game journalists, praising the departure from the Guitar Hero series‚Äìstyle of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America. ==Gameplay== alt=A video game screen. At the bottom, a curved arc shows three colored lines (green, red, and blue) that have round gems on them as well as move back and forth along the arc. A meter shows a scoring value and number of stars. Above and behind this, two human characters are using shown using a turntable mixer; the two characters are wearing black, futuristic objects and wear helmets to mask their identity. DJ Hero primarily simulates turntablism, a musical style used by disc jockeys to create a new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \\"stream\\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \\"Euphoria\\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \\"Euphoria\\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \\"Rewind\\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games. A single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\\"DJ vs DJ\\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \\"DJ vs Guitar\\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time. ==Development== alt=A black turntable with three buttons on the rotating deck. Activision had initially applied for a trademark on the name DJ Hero in early 2008, leading to speculation that Activision was making plans to compete against Konami's Beatmania series of music video games with their own DJ game as a possible spinoff of their popular Guitar Hero series. FreeStyleGames, a small developer of music games, was employed to help produce localized downloadable content for Guitar Hero games and develop another yet- to-be announced music game. This game was later revealed to be DJ Hero. Activision CEO Robert Kotick confirmed the existence of DJ Hero in an interview with CNBC on January 20, 2009, revealing a release \\"later this year\\". Activision CFO Thomas Tippl stated that DJ Hero would be aimed at a broader audience than the Guitar Hero games primarily through the use of more contemporary music in its soundtrack. Producer Will Townsend stated they opted for a wide variety of music to \\"make sure that everybody has something in there that they want.\\" DJ Hero was designed as a party game and to make the player \\"the life of the party\\", giving ways for them to be \\"in control of the music\\", according to Townsend. FreeStyleGames teamed up with London based music production company Crossfade Cartel owned by Ofei Sakyi and Dan Neil to ensure the overall quality of the soundtrack. The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music sequencer program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few minutes to complete, compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero. The team worked alongside artists and DJs for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJs working prototypes of the game and hardware to show them what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJs was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJs themselves; the team outlined the goals of the game and requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists. The \\"Renegade\\" edition of DJ Hero includes the turntable controller and a case that can be converted into a stand for the controller. DJ Shadow was brought in by Activision during November and December 2008, at least a year into the development into the game, to help select individual songs, help with creating the mixes, and provide additional input for the game, and will also be a playable DJ avatar in the game. He was able to identify old effects samples that were used in the past for scratching for the developers to include the game. To create the mixes, DJ Shadow first created a \\"dry version\\" of each mix which did not include any embellishments. DJ Shadow then proceeded to build off that to create the \\"wet version\\" with added effects that was used as the base for the gameplay's mixes. Artists Eminem and Jay-Z have also served as consultants for the game; a special edition of DJ Hero was branded with their names, and included a limited edition of the controller, a music CD of their songs, a DJ stand, and a travel case for the units. This version is titled \\"Renegade Edition.\\" Jay-Z stated that he \\"[loved] the freedom\\" that the game gives him, and was able to work closely with Activision to put in new mixes that he envisioned, and considered the game \\"a DJ's universe\\", while Eminem believed DJ Hero was a game that he could \\"see [himself] actually playing\\". DJs Z-Trip and DJ AM both created mixes for the game and will also be playable DJs in the game; Z-Trip will also help demonstrate the game at the 2009 E3 Conference. Cut Chemist and J.Period will also be assisting in creating mixes for the game. Grandmaster Flash and DJ Jazzy Jeff have contributed remixes to the soundtrack. All the Daft Punk remixes were created in-house by the team in London. All of these artists appeared as playable avatars. In the case of Daft Punk, a special venue inspired by the group's Alive 2007 tour was created, that Tim Riley, Vice President for Music Affairs at Activision, considered to be \\"the next best thing to being at a Daft Punk concert\\". David Guetta has also contributed three mixes that were made available as downloadable content for the game; Guetta would also serve as a spokesperson in the game's European marketing. As part of the game's promotion, the DJ Hero controller appears in the music video for Kid Cudi's \\"Make Her Say\\". The \\"Renegade\\" edition of DJ Hero being played with the controller converted into a table. On August 28, 2009, DJ AM, a significant contributor to DJ Hero, was found dead in his apartment in New York City. His death did not affect the release of the game. Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs for Activision, stated that \\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of DJ AM. We hope that his work on the game will be a fitting tribute to his creative spirit and musical talent\\". Also, at least one promotional video for the game has included a screen commemorating the deceased DJ, with the message \\"DJ AM, 1973‚Äì2009. In memory of a visionary.\\" Neversoft's Brian Bright revealed that the use of Guitar Hero guitar controllers within DJ Hero arose when they tried to create mixes of guitar-heavy and rock tracks in the game; they felt something was missing in these mixes and added in the Guitar Hero-style of play alongside it. Bright has stated that, while too late for the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller interoperability, including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero. DJ Hero 2 DJ Hero 2 was officially announced in June 2010 and was released in October 2010, featuring more than 70 mashups from over 85 artists. The game includes several new gameplay modes, including a \\"Empire\\" career mode, head-to-head DJ battles, social multiplayer modes, and a jump-in and out Party Play mode similar to Guitar Hero 5. The game includes more vocal options for singing and rapping to songs, and a freestyle mode for players. Artists include Eminem, Daft Punk, Chamillionaire, Dr. Dre, Chemical Brothers, Kanye West, Metallica, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna, while Deadmau5, DJ Qbert, David Guetta and Ti√´sto are playable avatars in the game. Prior to the game's announcement, Activision revealed a month before the game's release that it is actively seeking artists for downloadable content and a sequel to the game. One DJ in speculation to appear is DJ BJ, including mixer DJ Qbert. David Guetta has stated that he is set to work on the game's sequel to arrive late in 2010. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that despite low sales of DJ Hero, they are committed to continuing the series, with the sequel due in 2010. The sequel, DJ Hero 2, was further confirmed during an Activision investors report for 2009, citing it as one of only 2 major Guitar Hero titles to be expected from Activision in 2010, with an expected late-2010 release date. DJ Hero 3D At Nintendo's E3 press conference on June 15, 2010, the Nintendo 3DS handheld console was revealed. At the conference Nintendo listed a number of publishers and franchises coming to the 3DS, one of whom was Activision with DJ Hero 3D, a new installment in the DJ Hero series and the first handheld DJ Hero title. The gameplay is similar in nature to DJ Hero, where the stylus and touchscreen are used to mimic scratching and crossfading between songs. It was later cancelled due to poor sales of DJ Hero 2. Legal conflicts On April 15, 2009, the publishers of Scratch: The Ultimate DJ, Genius Products and Numark, sued against Scratch's developer, 7 Studios and Activision. The lawsuit contends that Activision purchased 7 Studios to both gain access to proprietary technology and to delay publication of the game so DJ Hero could come out first. The Los Angeles Superior Court in which the suit was filed did not grant the requested restraining order against Activision on DJ Hero. Activision states that Scratch was already delayed by as early as October 2008, before they made contact with 7 Studios, and their acquisition of the developers did not impede them from completing Scratch. However, on April 20, the court reversed its decision, awarding Genius and Numark a temporary restraining order, and ordered the \\"immediate return\\" of all of the material from 7 Studios from Activision, including all source code related to Scratch. 7 Studios subsequently filed a counter-suit against Genius Products, claiming that they engaged in \\"unlawful and unsavoury business practices\\" that limited 7 Studios from completing the game as planned. ==Soundtrack== Over 100 individual songs based on master recordings were licensed by Activision, composed into 93 DJ mixes by both participating internationally known DJs and an in-house remix team. Unusually, the audio team also acted as the design team, playtesting all mixes and creating gameplay in tandem with producing the mixes. All mixes were produced using Ableton Live, with most of the scratch routines being performed by former DMC World DJ Champion DJ Blakey. All mixes used in the soundtrack were unique at the time of the game's release. Celebrity mix artists include DJ Shadow, DJ Z-Trip, DJ AM, and Daft Punk in addition to other mix artists listed below, although Daft Punk did not create their levels - they were all created by the in-house remix team. Initial industry speculation stated that DJ Ti√´sto would be involved with the game, but this was eventually denied. Mix Master Mike of the Beastie Boys was reported to have signed an exclusivity deal with 7 Studios to appear in their game Scratch: The Ultimate DJ, meaning that he would also not appear on DJ Hero. The individual songs themselves were pulled from a large number of music genres, including Pop, Grunge, Soul, R&B;, Techno, Hip Hop, House, Drum & Bass. Most mashup concepts were conceived by the in-house remix team. In addition to mixes using individual songs from both Eminem and Jay-Z, including Jay-Z's \\"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\\" and \\"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\\". Eminem also stated that he will have additional songs included later in the year as downloadable content for the game, such as the \\"Jay-Z vs. Eminem Mix Pack\\" released in March 2010, featuring three mash up-style songs combining the works of both artists. Universal Music Group is providing much of the content for the game. ==Reception== Reviews DJ Hero has received positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart of the music genre given the large number of titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed to meet the needs of the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from \\"Medium\\" to \\"Hard\\" and \\"Expert\\" levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the \\"Easy\\" difficulty being \\"less thrilling and engaging\\" compared to Guitar Hero, the game was \\"structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit\\" with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in \\"Hard\\" mode over \\"Medium\\" were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in \\"Hard\\" and \\"Expert\\" modes. Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both \\"a bane and a boon\\"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels. Reviewers found the on-disc soundtrack to be generally strong; Hatfield believed that \\"the entire soundtrack is superb and could easily stand on its own outside the game\\". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer considered it to be one of the \\"most adventurous\\" soundtracks of any music game, and said though it often relied too much on pop hits, it remained true to the spirit of the DJ mix scene. Minkley thought the game to have \\"vital, varied, surprising and vast musical content\\" and to be a fresh experience compared to previous music games. Other reviewers felt the soundtrack had some weak areas. Shae noted that many of the mixes felt like \\"random mash-ups that take disparate songs\\", which would be appropriate for a live DJ, but does not reflect well on the art of mixing that can be performed today. Li noted a clear distinction in the quality of the mixes between the early sets--those mostly created in-house by FreeStyleGames--and the latter sets centered on the work of famous DJs. While Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica felt the soundtrack was good, he asserted that individual songs were unrecognizable because of modifications made to them for the mixes, and that they were more difficult to adjust to within the gameplay itself. Many reviews for DJ Hero felt the addition of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ- vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epileptic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped. Time named DJ Hero one of the ten best video games of 2009, considering it \\"the new contender for best party game\\". USA Today considered DJ Hero the best music game of the year. DJ Hero also won Best Soundtrack at the Spike Video Game Awards 2009. DJ Hero has been nominated for the \\"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\\" Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Sales Prior to DJ Hero's release, game industry analysts had projected the title would sell 1.6 million units in its first fiscal quarter; however, after disappointing sales performances of Guitar Hero 5 and The Beatles: Rock Band in the month prior to DJ Hero's release, analysis had lowered that expectation to 600,000 units. NPD Group figures for the month of October reported only 123,000 units of the game were sold in the United States, below the 175,000 units projected by analysts. November sales in North America were estimated at 211,000 units. Through January 2010, the game has sold 789,000 units in North America. Ars Technica, in considering the game as a \\"flop\\" in its present market due to these numbers, attributes the failure being due to four factors: the game was not suited for social play, the cost was prohibitive in the current market, the mixes in the game were relatively unknown despite the individual songs being well-known, and there was a lack of familiarity with how a turntable works for mixing compared with a guitar or drum kit. However, despite these figures, Activision claims that DJ Hero is the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America based on NPD data, which reporters attribute to the game's higher cost. Activision's Dan Amirch cited total North American sales of over 1.2 million units by June 2010, and commented on the \\"long tail\\" of sales that made DJ Hero initially appear to be a failure but instead has been considered a successful title by his company but they ran out of business. They still make money off their games today. ==See also== *Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX, DJ simulation games developed by Konami *Scratch: The Ultimate DJ, a similar game by Bedlam Studios ==References *Official website Category:2009 video games Category:Activision games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Musician video games Category:Turntable video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Wii games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Guitar Hero ","title":"DJ Hero"},{"id":"19353909","text":"St. Joseph's Roman Catholic High School may refer to: *St. Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Workington *St. Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Newport ","title":"St. Joseph's Roman Catholic High School"},{"id":"19353912","text":"Myra Albert Wiggins (1869‚Äì1956) was an American painter and pictorial photographer who became a member of the important early 20th century Photo- Secession movement. ==Life== Early years (1869‚Äì89) Wiggins, n√©e Myra Jane Albert, was born on December 15, 1869 in Salem, Oregon. She was the second of four children born to John Henry Albert and Mary Elizabeth Holman. Her father worked his way from being a bookkeeper in a local linseed oil company to becoming president of the Capital National Bank in Salem. She showed natural artistic talent at an early age, and she would spend hours drawing and painting both in her home and in the fields around Salem. Her parents encouraged her talent both because she was very good and because a cultural background in the arts was expected for upper class women of the time. When she was 17, she won the first of many awards for painting at the Oregon State Fair, and between 1886 and 1907 she won a total of 94 more state fair awards for her art. About 1888 she met her future husband, Frederick Arthur Wiggins, who was the owner of a local store that was one of the first to offer a variety of products under one roof. Among the products he offered were bicycles, which at that time were first becoming a craze among younger people, and Myra recalled that she first met Fred while riding around town on her bicycle. Their families were very active in outdoor activities, and several times a year they would see each other at outings in the area. Wiggins said that her introduction to photography was her brother's doing since he wanted to take a photograph of his sweetheart and, not having a camera, thought their father would be more likely to buy one if both of them said they would use it. In 1889, they acquired a large glass-plate camera and tripod, and soon she was using it far more than her brother. Some of her first pictures were taken on one of her family's many trips to the Oregon Coast. Within two years she won a new camera as first prize in the amateur division of a competition held by West Shore magazine, and many of the photographs she submitted for the contest were exhibited at the Portland North Pacific Industrial Exposition in 1890. Becoming an artist (1890‚Äì99) Myra Albert Wiggins: Hunger is the Best Cook, 1898 Like many progressive women of the late 19th century, Myra was sent to New York City for her higher education. She studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1891 to 1894, where she took classes from William Merritt Chase and John Twachtman. Chase in particular influenced her thinking about art, and when she brought her photographs for him to view he would sometimes write comments on the back of them. She immortalized Chase in a famous 1891 photograph of the artist teaching at the league, surrounded by his female students. While she was studying in New York, she would return to Salem during the summers, and in the summer of 1892, she announced her engagement to Fred Wiggins. When she returned to New York that fall, she became one of the first female members of the New York Camera Club. She used the club's darkroom facilities, and it was here that she met Joseph Keiley, an influential photographer, writer, and close friend of Alfred Stieglitz. She and her fianc√© were married on November 24, 1894, in Salem, and their daughter Mildred, their only child, was born in 1896. Master of photography (1900‚Äì29) In 1900, Wiggins was given first of two one-woman exhibitions of her photography at the Chicago Art Institute. She had already met and corresponded with the most important photographer of the time, Alfred Stieglitz, and in 1903 he admitted her as a member in the newly formed Photo-Secession. In the fall of 1903, one of Wiggins photographs was included in the Hamburg Jubilee Exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, and in the London Salon organized by the famous Linked Ring. A review of the latter exhibition in the British magazine Photography contains these words of praise: : \\"All things considered, we consider Mrs. Wiggins' picture called Polishing Brass one of the finest in the whole room. It certainly is the most pictorial, and is exactly like a print by Chodowiecke , both in subject and feeling. A woman is seated at a table with metal utensils of quaint and interesting form. The whole thing is quiet, healthy, and exceedingly well-designed ‚Äì an example for hundreds.\\" In 1904, Wiggins was one of five Oregon delegates selected to go on a \\"Cruise of the Christians\\" to attend the World's Fourth Sunday School Convention in Jerusalem. She photographed scenes both on the boat and when she arrived, often developing the film in her room at night. On the return trip she stopped in Paris and London specifically to see major photographic salons that were on exhibit at the time. Later that year she published Letters from a Pilgrim (Salem: Statesman Publishing), a photographically illustrated description of her journey to the Middle East. Myra Albert Wiggins: Two Pilgrims (self-portrait of Wiggins on the right). Published in her book Letters from a Pilgrim, 1904 That same year, Stieglitz sent 200 photographs representing the best artists of the Photo-Secession to the Hague International Photography Exhibition. Among those artists he included were Wiggins and her Oregon colleague Sarah Ladd. Wiggins also had photographs published in several important magazines, including Photo-Era, The Photo Miniature, Photograms of the Year and Die Kunst in Der Photographie (a high quality German quarterly similar to Camera Work). Wiggins' mother Mary died in 1905 after being in a car wreck. Her father, who was driving, was not injured, but he suffered greatly from guilt and anguish in the following years. In 1906, she was included in the invitational exhibit \\"The Work of Women Photographers of America\\" at the Camera Club of Hartford, Connecticut. Wiggins was one of 26 women who were presented in the show. Later that year two of her photographs were included in the annual members exhibit at Stieglitz's Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession in New York. By 1907, Fred Wiggins wanted to enter the plant nursery business and he moved his family to Toppenish in central Washington. Fred started the Washington Nursery Company, and Wiggins tried to help her husband financially by opening an art studio and school. Her new hometown area was much more rural and undeveloped than Salem, and much of the countryside around the town was dry and dusty. The dust caused health problems for Wiggins, and it was several years before she could produce a regular income from her painting. Wiggins continued to photograph as much as her health allowed, and she exhibited again at the Little Galleries in New York and at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition in San Francisco. Fellow Photo- Secessionist Anne Brigman commented on Wiggins' photos in the latter show, saying she \\"invariably infuses her work with an atmosphere of tender sadness.\\" Over the next decade Wiggins' photos were shown in many important exhibitions, including the International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography in New York City (1909), the Annual Pictorial Photography Invitation in Seattle, Washington (1910) and the landmark International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography (1910) at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. Encouraged by the interest in her work by other photographers in Seattle, Wiggins started to spend more time in that city. From the mid-1910s to the late 1920s, she alternated between helping her husband with his business and taking her photographs to Seattle when there was enough money to go. During this time she also developed an interest in lecturing about her work, other photographers and about art in general. In 1928, the Seattle Fine Arts Society gave Wiggins her last one-woman photography exhibit. Master of painting (1930‚Äì56) In 1930, Wiggins co-founded the Women Painters of Washington, one of the state's oldest existing arts organizations. Through her lecturing and classes, she became a vital force in most of the region's arts activities. In 1932 she moved permanently to Seattle. She continued to paint for many years and was recognized for her artistry through retrospective exhibits at the Seattle Art Museum (1953) and the de Young Museum in San Francisco (1954). She also had one-person shows of her paintings in Vancouver, Chicago, New Orleans, Louisiana and New York. By the time she turned 86 in 1955, she had completed 114 paintings. On January 13, 1956, Wiggins died of a stroke. She was actively painting up until the time of her death. Her husband died in an accident four months later. Her work is in the permanent collections several important museums, including the Portland Art Museum, the Getty Museum and the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution. ==Further reading== *Glauber, Carole. \\"Myra Albert Wiggins: Arts and Crafts Photographer\\", Style 1900, May 1999. *Glauber, Carole. \\"A Wandering Lens - Myra Albert Wiggins: Photographer, Artist and Mentor\\", Artifact Magazine, March/April 1996. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American women painters Category:American women photographers Category:Photographers from Oregon Category:Artists from Salem, Oregon Category:19th-century American painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:19th-century American photographers Category:20th-century American photographers Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American women artists Category:19th-century women photographers Category:20th-century women photographers ","title":"Myra Albert Wiggins"},{"id":"19353916","text":"BayFest was an annual three-day music festival held in the heart of downtown Mobile, Alabama. Founded in 1995, the festival offered a variety of music including pop, jazz, classic rock, alternative, R&B;, rap, gospel, and modern rock. It was based at Bienville Square. The Launching Pad stage during Bayfest focused on local and regional talent. The event encouraged \\"going green\\" by providing for recycling throughout the grounds. After poor lineups combined with fewer acts and increasing ticket prices caused some years of diminishing interest, organizers for Bayfest announced its ending two weeks before its planned 2015 festival. ==History== Alabama at Bayfest in 2014. Growing from an initial attendance of 50,000 people in 1995, BayFest became known for its array of musical talent suited to a wide variety of tastes. In 2003, the festival included over 125 live musical acts on nine stages and had an average attendance of more than 200,000 people during the three-day weekend each year. Throughout the past fifteen years, acts such as 3 Doors Down, Alice in Chains, B.B. King, The Beach Boys, Big & Rich, Collective Soul, Hootie & the Blowfish, Keith Urban, LeAnn Rimes, Ludacris, The Temptations, Travis Tritt, Stone Temple Pilots, Uncle Kracker, and Velvet Revolver have performed at BayFest. The 2008 lineup included Better Than Ezra, Bow Wow, Buckcherry, Eric Church, Kid Rock, Nelly, Puddle of Mudd, Sister Hazel, Three Days Grace, and Wynonna Judd. During its first eleven years, BayFest was voted six times as Mobile's \\"Best Annual Event\\" in Mobile Bay Monthly magazine, surpassing the city's celebration of Mardi Gras. It has been named as one of the Southeast Tourism Society's \\"Top 20 Events\\" several times since 1995. In its later years, the event suffered from declining interest. Tropical Storm Karen adversely affected the festival in 2013. Financial concerns briefly led organizers to reschedule the 2015 event to the Grounds in West Mobile, before deciding to remain in downtown Mobile despite their difficulties. On September 16, 2015, organizers announced the event's ending, as well as the cancellation of its planned 21st festival. ==Organization== The festival was organized each year by BayFest, Inc., a non-profit organization consisting of more than 1000 non- paid volunteers.

He continued to serve in the Royal Air Force until the 1930s. ==Early life and early military career== Henry Winslow Woollett was born on 5 August 1895. He grew up in Southwold, Suffolk, and was educated at Wellingborough School (1907‚Äì1913). A doctor's son, he was pursuing medical studies when the First World War began. He enlisted and, on 18 November 1914, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment on 10 December. The following year he served in the Gallipoli Campaign, taking part in the landing at Suvla Bay in August 1915. In 1916, he requested and received a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps. He qualified as a pilot after only three and a half hours flight time, and was appointed a flying officer on 27 October 1916. ==Career as an flier== In November 1916, Woollett was assigned to No. 24 Squadron RFC to fly the Airco DH.2. These early fighter aircraft had a rear \\"pusher\\" engine format and a forward firing machine gun with a clear field of fire making synchronisation unnecessary. It was flying one of these that Woollett claimed his first victory, on 5 April 1917, destroying an Albatros D.III. He was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 13 July. No. 24 Squadron was then re-equipped with the Airco DH.5. The DH.5 was unusual in design with the top wing having a 'back stagger', behind the lower wing, to give the pilot good visibility, especially overhead. Given its lack of power (top speed was 102 miles per hour) and poor performance at higher altitudes, it was used more for ground attack than air combat. Nevertheless, it was while flying the DH.5 that Woollett destroyed three more German aircraft and drove another down 'out of control'. On 17 August 1917, he became a flying ace. He was posted back to England as a flight instructor at Eastbourne in August 1917. On 9 January 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross; a Bar in lieu of a second award would follow on 22 June. Woollett's career in fighters was spent in Camels. Number D6402 was his mainstay. Woollett returned to combat in France in March 1918 with No. 43 Squadron, flying a Sopwith Camel. He achieved ten victories in March and was a triple ace by month's end. Beginning on 24 March, he began a series of 22 victories with Camel number D6402, making it one of the more successful airframes in the war. Victories 14 and 15 were over observation balloons, considered highly dangerous targets due to their heavy anti-aircraft protection and fighter cover. Even in an era of relaxed garb and standards, Woollettt was colourful. He wore a leopardskin flying helmet and gauntlets when he flew. His aircraft was equally distinctive, with the propeller spinner painted as a Native American's face and a dragon trailing down the length of the fuselage. He also briefly adorned his aircraft with white 'splotches' as experimental camouflage to aid his balloon busting, but his superiors made him remove them. Eccentric he may have been, but Woollett was also effective. April 1918 saw him claim six more German aircraft and five more balloons. He shot down six aircraft on a single day‚Äî12 April. It was an achievement rivalled by very few other pilots during the First World War and surpassed by only one, Captain John Lightfoot Trollope of No 43 Squadron RAF who destroyed seven German machines on 24 March 1918.Guttman, Jon. Balloon- Busting Aces of World War 1. Osprey Books, 2013. p29. Belgium's top ace of the First World War, Willy Coppens described Woollett's exploits: Woollett downed a balloon and two aircraft in May 1918, an enemy fighter and two balloons in July, and finished up by destroying a Fokker D.VII to end his war with 35 victories. He had scored at least 23 of his triumphs in the same Camel, serial number D6402, which he overturned and damaged on 21 July. His final wartime duty was a posting back to England to command a training wing. Woollett's account consisted of 20 enemy aircraft destroyed (including 4 shot down in flames), 4 more aircraft down 'out of control' and 11 balloons destroyed. ==Postwar career== On 1 August 1919 Woollett was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) with the rank of captain, and later that month his home town of Southwold granted him the freedom of the borough \\"in recognition of his conspicuous services\\". He was also awarded the French Legion of Honour on 30 November 1918, and the Croix de Guerre with Palm on 15 July 1919. Woollett served in No. 8 Squadron RAF in Iraq until 1 April 1922, when transferred to the Iraq Command Stores Depot. From 14 January 1923 he served as adjutant at the Mechanical Transport Workshops and Pool in Palestine Command, before being posted to the headquarters of RAF Middle East in Egypt, on 31 March 1924. He then served at No. 4 Flying Training School, Egypt, from 16 April 1924, until being returned to the Home Establishment on 1 November. Woollett served in No. 24 Squadron RAF at RAF Kenley from 4 January 1927, and No. 43 Squadron RAF at RAF Tangmere from 26 June 1928, before being promoted to squadron leader on 12 December 1928. On 15 January 1930 Woollett was appointed Officer Commanding No. 23 Squadron RAF at Kenley, which comprised two flights of Bulldogs and one of Harts. One of the pilots assigned to his command was Douglas Bader, the Second World War ace. Woollett relinquished command of No. 23 Squadron on 9 December 1931, and on 3 February 1932 resigned his commission. Woollett joined the Air League of the British Empire and was appointed London Area organiser of the Air Defence Cadet Corps in mid-1938. On 1 February 1941, during the Second World War, Woollett was granted a commission as an acting pilot officer \\"for the duration of hostilities\\" in the Training Branch of the Reserve of Air Force Officers, but resigned his commission on 10 February 1942. Woollett died on 31 October 1969. ==Honours and awards== * Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur (France) ‚Äì 30 November 1918 * Croix de Guerre with Palm (France) ‚Äì 15 July 1919 Military Cross ‚Äì London Gazette, 9 January 1918.

They were also intended to haul passenger service on the steeply graded Sydney to Newcastle and Kiama lines. They proved unpopular with both locomotive crews because of rough riding and track maintenance staff because of their high axle load and were displaced from mainline working and relegated to branch line work following the arrival of the P6 class (C32 class). In 1905/06, new boilers with Belpaire fireboxes were fitted, the smokeboxes shortened and the cylinder diameter reduced.

He died while leading the ‚ÄúStonewall Brigade‚Äú during the Battle of Chancellorsville. ==Early life and career== Paxton was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia. He was the son of Margaret (McNutt) and Elisha Paxton, a Presbyterian family, and his grandfather was American Revolutionary War veteran William Paxton. His first education came from his cousin James H. Paxton's school. In 1845 he attended Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, and in 1847 he entered Yale University located in New Haven, Connecticut. Paxton then attended the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville in 1849,Eicher, p. 420. graduating at the top of his class.Robertson, p. 206. When fully grown Paxton was described as \\"five feet ten inches high, heavily built and of great bodily strength\\", a physique that inspired his childhood nickname, \\"Bull.‚ÄùSears, p. 330. He was known not to drink alcohol.Stonewall Hut biography of Paxton. \\"His strength of character was shown by the fact that at this time, when the drinking of whiskey was a universal custom, he abstained altogether from its use, and continued to do so until his death.\\" Upon graduating Paxton settled in Virginia and became a lawyer, then a bank president in Lexington. He also later worked as a planter, and then moved to Ohio. After passing the state's bar examination, he worked for several years in Ohio prosecuting land claims. His law practice ended in 1860 because of his failing eyesight, but this did not stop him from becoming prominent in political matters. His son Matthew wrote that \\"he was a man of ardent temperament and strong convictions such as did not permit him to remain an indifferent spectator of the exciting political occurrences of era.\\" His \\"blunt and outspoken views\\" on behalf of the secession of South Carolina caused a rift in his friendship with Lexington resident Thomas J. Jackson; the two men did not speak to each other until after each had joined the Confederate Army. When he was 26, Paxton married 23-year-old Elizabeth Hannah White (died February 16, 1872) on November 2, 1854. She was the daughter of Matthew White and lived in Lexington. They would have four children together, three of whom out-lived Paxton: Matthew W. Paxton, John G. Paxton, and Frank Paxton. The actor Bill Paxton was a direct descendant of Elisha Paxton (great- great-grandson) and his son John Gallatin Paxton. Matthew became the editor of the newspaper Rockbridge County News and John a lawyer in Kansas City, Missouri. Frank lived in San Saba County, Texas. ==Civil War service== At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Paxton chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause. Despite a lack of any military training, Paxton entered the Confederate Army on April 18 as a first lieutenant of the Rockbridge Rifles, part of Col. James F. Preston's 4th Virginia Infantry Regiment. First Bull Run, actions 2 p.m. July 21 The 4th Virginia fought on July 21 during the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) in Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's First Brigade of the Army of the Shenandoah, soon to be known as the Stonewall Brigade. Paxton was wounded in an arm during this battle and his actions won him praise from his comrades.Antietam on the web biography of Paxton. \\"He was cited for bravery at 1st Manassas for carrying the colors of a Georgia regiment, whose bearer had been shot: '[he] advanced before the regiment, waving his hat, was the first to plant our banner upon their battery.'\\" After recovering, Paxton was electedDuring the American Civil War, the enlisted men themselves voted for their officers, electing the regiment's lieutenants, captains, and majors. major of the 27th Virginia Infantry on October 14, 1861, but was not re-elected to the position the following spring because of his \\"heavy-handedness and a lack of tact\\".Robertson, p. 626. On May 30, 1862, Paxton was appointed aide-de-camp to Jackson's staff, and participated in the Valley Campaign of the Shenandoah Valley and the Seven Days Battles, both in Virginia. By August 4, 1862, Paxton was made Jackson's assistant quartermaster, and fought in the Northern Virginia Campaign. Paxton was appointed assistant adjutant general (chief of staff)Robertson, p. 590. on Jackson's staff on August 15, and took part in the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 28-30, and then in the Maryland Campaign and the Battle of Antietam on September 17. Stonewall Brigade Col. Andrew J. Grigsby took over the Stonewall Brigade when its commander Col. William Baylor was killed at Second Bull Run. At Antietam, the loss of Brig. Gen John R. Jones and Brig. Gen William Starke left Grigsby in charge of an entire division, two command levels above his rank. Despite this, Jackson refused to give him permanent command of anything above regimental level. On November 1, 1862, Paxton was promoted from major to brigadier general and assigned command of the Stonewall Brigade.Wright, p. 96. Appointed from Virginia on November 1, 1862, to rank from that date, and confirmed by Confederate Congress on April 22, 1863. It was a move that did not sit well with the men he passed over, officers with more experience as well as seniority. Paxton was the choice of Jackson and the posting was made directly by Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Although Jackson rarely deviated from protocol for promotions, his justification for selecting Paxton was that none of the subordinate commanders in the Stonewall Brigade was the \\"best qualified\\" for the position because \\"I did not regard any of them as competent as another.\\" Paxton assumed command of the brigade on November 15. Grigsby was \\"as mad as thunder\\" and resigned his commission in protest.Robertson, p. 627. During the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, Paxton and his brigade in the division of Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro were on the right of the Confederate defense when Union Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's division made a brief (and unsupported) successful attack, but Paxton's men counterattacked and drove the Federals off. Fredericksburg campaign historian Frank O'Reilly criticized Paxton's performance during the engagement, judging that: Chancellorsville and death Chancellorsville, actions May 3. By the spring of 1863, Bull Paxton, who a member of his staff described as a \\"rather profane and godless man\\" found new solace in religion, possibly because of his association with the religious Stonewall Jackson. He started carrying a pocket Bible and on the night before the Battle of Chancellorsville, he admitted a premonition of his death and prepared himself for it. On the second day of battle, the brigade was part of Jackson's audacious flanking movement around Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's army. Paxton and his brigade were stationed to guard Germanna Junction on May 2, and that night his men were ordered to the front line. After Jackson was wounded, command of the Second Corps went briefly to Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, but when he too was hit, cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart was given command. On May 3 Paxton led his men through densely wooded terrain towards the Union position. He was on foot at the head of his brigade when he was shot through his chest, killing him within an hour.Paxton Family tree descriptions. May 4, 1863 letter from Henry Kyd Douglas (Paxton's aide-de-camp) to now widowed Elizabeth Hannah White Paxton. Warner, p. 230: \\"... he was almost instantly killed by a Mini√© ball.\\" Lt. Randolph Barton of Paxton's staff wrote that Paxton fell only two feet away from him. \\"I placed my arm under him, when he muttered, 'Tie up my arm', and died. He was not shot in the arm, but through the heart.\\" Later that day army commander Gen. Robert E. Lee sent a wire to the authorities in the Confederate capitol of Richmond, saying: Paxton was initially buried at Guinea Station, Virginia, a short distance from where Jackson lay dying. He was later brought back to Lexington and was re-buried there in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery, within a few feet of his former commander.Warner, p. 230. ==See also== * List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) ==NotesReferences== * Eicher, John H., and David J.

The series is centered on the fictional Southern Californian town of Perdido Beach, in which every human aged 15 and older vanishes. The town and surrounding areas become encased within an impenetrable barrier that burns to the touch, with many of its inhabitants developing supernatural powers. The books follow the exploits of the protagonist/hero, Sam Temple, as he battles antagonists Caine Soren, Drake Merwin, and Diana Ladris as well as a mysterious, malevolent creature, known as the Darkness or the Gaiaphage (gai-uh-fage) (derived from Gaia, a Greek personification of the Earth, and \\"phage\\", from the Greek œÜŒ±Œ≥Œµ·øñŒΩ ' \\"to devour\\" or \\"worm\\"). The first novel in this series, titled Gone, was published in 2008. The second book, Hunger, was released a year later, followed by the third book, Lies, on May 4, 2010. The fourth book, Plague, was released on April 5, 2011. The fifth book, Fear, was released on April 3, 2012, in the United States and the United Kingdom, although it was released as early as March 23 in Australia and Hong Kong. The sixth book, Light, was released on April 2, 2013. The series ‚Äì \\"a fun, no-brainer read directed towards teenagers\\" ‚Äì has been hailed as \\"ridiculously popular\\" and \\"a sensation in the young adult world\\". A planned Monster Trilogy, also known as Season Two, began on October 17, 2017 with the release of Monster. It was set four years later from the events that took place in the other books. Villain was released on October 18, 2018 and Hero was released on October 1, 2019. ==Novels== Gone The story starts with the sudden disappearance of everybody aged 15 or older from the town of Perdido Beach, causing extreme confusion and chaos amongst those remaining in the town. Classmates Sam Temple, Quinn Gaither, Astrid Ellison, and Edilio Escobar discover an impermeable barrier cutting Perdido Beach off from the outside world; the area within the barrier is subsequently nicknamed \\"Fallout Alley Youth Zone\\", shortened to \\"the FAYZ\\". Unknown to the others, Sam had earlier discovered his superhuman ability to fire light from his hands capable of burning objects when he is afraid; after reading a journal entry by his mother Connie, a nurse at the nearby Coates Academy, Sam begins to suspect a connection to the disappearances and the barrier. While looking for Astrid's severely autistic four-year-old brother \\"Little\\" Pete at a nuclear power plant outside of town, the quartet discover that the barrier's boundaries correspond to predicted radiation patterns in the case of a meltdown. Pete is revealed to have superhuman abilities in an incident that also exposes Sam's powers to the group, who agree to keep it secret. Upon the group's return to Perdido Beach, they encounter vehicles bringing students from Coates Academy, led by the charismatic Caine Soren. Caine restores order to Perdido Beach with the aid of his confidante Diana Ladris and enforcer Drake Merwin, but Sam and Astrid are suspicious of Caine's motives. Caine - revealed to have the power of telekinesis, Diana - who has the ability to determine the strength of others' powers, and Drake - a violent sadist with no powers of his own - discover that when inhabitants of the FAYZ turn 15, they are confronted by something they desire before vanishing, a phenomenon nicknamed \\"the poof\\", but can remain in the FAYZ by resisting whatever tempts them. Caine also discovers that he and Sam are twin brothers that were separated at birth, with Sam remaining with their mother, a revelation that deeply upsets Caine. Quinn, who has started hanging out with Caine's friends, tells Caine of Sam's powers. Feeling threatened, Caine enlists his crew, including local bully Charles \\"Orc\\" Merriman and his lackey Howard Bassem, to kidnap Sam, Astrid (who have begun dating) and Pete. Quinn frees Sam and Astrid and Pete are freed from Drake by Pete's abilities. Caine instructs Drake to kill Astrid and Pete, but Sam saves her. Sam, Astrid, Quinn, Pete, and Edilio escape town. Meanwhile, teenager Lana Arwen Lazar is injured in a car crash after her grandfather disappears from the FAYZ, but discovers she has healing abilities and uses them to recover. Lana encounters a pack of coyotes that can talk. The coyotes take her to a mineshaft, where an entity the coyotes call \\"the Darkness\\" lives. Lana encounters Sam's group and together they escape the coyotes, only to be captured by Drake and taken to Coates Academy. Caine has their hands sealed in concrete, as he has discovered that the superhuman abilities are channelled by hand. Astrid coerces Pete into using his abilities to free Sam's group and the other students held prisoner, and Caine, Diana and Drake flee, with Sam burning Drake's arm off in the process. Sam's group and the Coates students - amongst them Taylor, who can teleport, Brianna \\"The Breeze\\", who can run at superhuman speeds, and Dekka, who can control gravity - return to Perdido Beach. Drake infiltrates the town and kidnaps Lana, believing she can regenerate his arm. Meanwhile, Orc and Howard decide to escape town to avoid Sam, but encounter Drake and the coyotes, who are still seeking Lana for the Darkness' own ends. Orc is mauled by the coyotes, while Howard convinces the coyotes to bring Drake and Lana to the mineshaft before fleeing. The Darkness gives Drake command of the coyotes and coerces Lana to heal Drake's arm, which regenerates as a whip-like tentacle. Drake returns to Coates Academy and Caine prepares to attack Perdido Beach before he \\"poofs\\". Unknown to Caine, Diana sends his subordinate \\"Computer\\" Jack, who is concealing his own ability of super-strength, to Perdido Beach to tell Sam how to escape the \\"poof\\". At Perdido Beach, Sam anticipates Caine's attack and makes plans to defend the town. He sends Edilio to the power plant to recover a cache of guns, as well as security footage from the time the FAYZ was created. Sam shows the footage to Astrid, revealing that Pete had created the FAYZ in order to prevent the power plant going into meltdown. The battle begins with Caine's goons distracting Sam while Drake and the coyotes take a class of preschoolers hostage, along with their carer Mary Terrafino. Sam, Quinn, Edilio and the formerly captive Coates kids join forces to rescue the preschoolers; Orc, who survived the coyote attack and had subsequently transformed into a tall, gravel-skinned being, fights Drake to a stalemate. Caine confronts Sam before Jack can tell Sam how to survive the \\"poof\\", and the two soon disappear as they turn 15. The duo encounter a vision of Connie, who invites them to return to her. Both boys refuse, with Sam declaring that he has work to do in the FAYZ. Connie transforms into a manifestation of the Darkness, which gloats that Caine will come to it willingly, before disappearing. The boys return to the FAYZ; Sam is the first to recover, and coerces Caine and the Coates students to retreat, but Caine declares he will return. Later, student Albert Hillsborough organizes a Thanksgiving dinner for the town and Sam encourages the residents of the FAYZ to stick together. Meanwhile, the coyotes' pack leader takes Caine to the Darkness. Hunger Three months after the end of Gone, Sam has become mayor of Perdido Beach, but struggles with the responsibilities of protecting the town. Food supplies are dwindling, exacerbated by the presence of mutated carnivorous worms called \\"zekes\\" that prevent access to crop fields and only partially alleviated by Quinn's idea to begin fishing the nearby ocean. Other children are beginning to discover their mutant abilities, including Duck Zhang, who can control his density, and Hunter Lefkowitz, who can emit deadly microwave rays. Little Pete is also starting to reveal more of his powers, including the ability to create life. Tensions between mutants and non-mutants escalate after Hunter accidentally kills his roommate Harry with his powers during a confrontation between Hunter and the anti-mutant Zil Sperry. Zil and his posse, dubbing themselves the \\"Human Crew\\", capture and attempt to lynch Hunter before being forced to disperse by Orc. Albert, having learned from Lana of a cache of gold near the mineshaft where the Darkness lurks, travels there with Quinn and Lana to obtain the gold with the intention of using it to make currency for the FAYZ. Lana, traumatised by her encounter with the Darkness, abandons them to attempt to kill the Darkness by detonating LPG in the mineshaft. The Darkness, which calls itself the gaiaphage and whose physical form is revealed as a mass of green crystalline particles, subdues Lana. At Coates Academy, Caine wakes after having spent the past three months in a fugue state following his encounter with the gaiaphage and makes plans to seize control of the nuclear power plant. While performing reconnaissance, Drake captures Orsay Pettijohn, a mutant with the ability to view people's dreams. Diana manipulates Jack, taking refuge in Perdido Beach, to help Caine in accessing the computers at the plant. Caine and his crew assault the power plant and shut off power to Perdido Beach; Sam, having realized Caine's plan, rushes to confront him. Caine realizes that he has been manipulated by the gaiaphage, as it needs radioactive uranium from the power plant to \\"feed\\". Forced to submit to the gaiaphage's will, Caine takes the uranium to the mineshaft, damaging the reactor and permanently cutting off power in the FAYZ, and leaving Drake behind to stall Sam. Caine also sends Bug, a mutant with the ability of camouflage, to bring Orsay to the mineshaft in order to determine the gaiaphage's objectives. Drake coerces Sam into allowing himself to be tortured by threatening to trigger a reactor meltdown. Sam is rescued by Brianna, who severs part of Drake's tentacle, but Sam is left close to death; Drake retreats to join up with Caine. Bug tells the children of Perdido Beach Caine's plan in exchange for food. Edilio takes Orsay to the mineshaft, and Orsay relays to the children of Perdido Beach the gaiaphage's desire to \\"feed\\". Astrid speculates that the gaiaphage came to Earth in a meteor strike that hit the power plant 13 years prior, that the radiation both sustains the gaiaphage and has caused the mutations, and that the gaiaphage has been manipulating Pete, Lana, and Caine with the aim of creating indestructible physical forms for itself capable of resisting the children of the FAYZ. Edilio and Dekka travel to the mineshaft to find Lana under the influence of the gaiaphage. Lana shoots and critically wounds Edilio before retreating into the mineshaft, while Dekka is attacked by coyotes. Caine, Drake, Diana and Jack arrive, soon followed by Sam, Quinn, Brianna, and Duck (Sam having reasoned that the gaiaphage is unprepared for Duck's abilities). Drake, now loyal to the gaiaphage instead of Caine, attacks Diana. Enraged, Caine defies the gaiaphage to throw Drake and the uranium into the mineshaft before collapsing it, but realises that Lana must be rescued to save Diana. Using Duck's powers to tunnel into the mineshaft, Caine and Sam confront the gaiaphage, which is \\"feeding\\" on the uranium. Duck sacrifices himself by having Caine throw him at the gaiaphage while he uses his power, creating a void that sucks in the gaiaphage. Lana is freed from the gaiaphage's influence and heals the children of their injuries, and Caine and Diana depart. Back at Perdido Beach, Sam steps down as mayor and shares responsibilities with a council, though many still sympathize with the Human Crew. The children gain access to the crops by feeding the zekes mutant \\"blue bats\\" previously discovered by Duck. Hunter, left brain-damaged as a result of his ordeal, is exiled from Perdido Beach. Brittney Donegal, a girl seemingly killed in Caine's attack on the power plant, is buried in the graveyard in the town plaza; unknown to the rest of the children, Brittney has the power of immortality and remains conscious, with a mysterious slug (Drake's severed tentacle) attached to her arm. Lies Four months after Gone, Sam is still traumatized by his torture by Drake. His fears increase after the Human Crew abduct Jill, a young girl with siren-like mutant abilities, and dump her in an empty grave which Sam and Edilio realise was previously occupied by Brittney; it is implied that Sam and Edilio know the slug on Brittney's arm was Drake's severed tentacle. Jill is taken in by Orsay and her helper, a mysterious girl named Nerezza unfamiliar to the children of Perdido Beach. Orsay, whose powers have grown so that she can contact people outside the FAYZ through dreams, begins telling children that they can escape the FAYZ through the \\"poof\\". After Sam is unsuccessful in concealing Orsay's claims from the council, Astrid convinces the other councillors to tell Perdido Beach that Orsay is lying, despite not being able to disprove Orsay's claims. Sam's deception causes a rift between him and Astrid and prompt their break-up. Brittney reappears in Perdido Beach, guided by visions of her deceased brother Tanner that give her cryptic warnings of a \\"demon\\"; her reappearance is soon followed by the discovery of several bodies who show signs of being whipped to death. At Coates, Caine and his remaining followers learns of San Francisco de Sales, a private island owned by Hollywood power couple Jennifer Brattle and Todd Chance located within the FAYZ, and Caine makes plans to relocate to the island. To this end he reaches out to Zil and the Human Crew, arranging for the Human Crew to set fire to Perdido Beach to create a distraction for Caine and his group to steal boats from the town's marina. While responding to the fire, Sam is attacked by Drake and flees Perdido Beach in terror. Caine and those he deems useful - Diana, Bug, and a cruel mutant named Penny with the ability to create illusions - make it to San Francisco de Sales, which they discover is still occupied by the Brattle-Chances' adopted children. The Brattle-Chances, knowing that they will eventually run out of supplies, drug Caine's group and attempt to flee to Perdido Beach by helicopter. Caine wakes and uses his abilities to stop the Brattle-Chances, but is forced to release them to stop Diana attempting suicide. In the aftermath of the fire, Albert hosts a cookout to raise morale, while Brianna brings Sam back to town. Astrid, realizing that the children no longer respect her, uses her authority as a council member to pass laws aimed at maintaining order in the town before resigning her position. Nerezza convinces Zil and the Human Crew to launch another attack at the cookout, while Drake reappears and begins attacking the children. Nerezza attempts to kill Pete before being stopped by Astrid, who realizes that the gaiaphage had used Pete to create Nerezza by manipulating Pete into thinking he was creating a protagonist for his game console. Mary attempts to kill the preschoolers by having them jump off a cliff as she turns 15, having been influenced by Orsay and Nerezza to believe that their deaths will allow them to reawaken outside of the FAYZ. The children are saved by Brianna and Dekka, the latter of whom also kills Zil, but Mary disappears. Nerezza, who has killed Orsay, uses Jill's abilities in an attempt to prevent the children from fighting back, but is distracted by the arrival of the Brattle-Chances. Sam destroys Nerezza and attempts to destroy Drake, who now has the ability of regeneration, but ultimately relents when Drake transforms into Brittney and instead has her locked in a basement with Orc keeping guard. Pete's game console is destroyed in the showdown at Clifftop; in his anguish, Pete briefly causes the FAYZ barrier to disappear, giving Perdido Beach a brief glimpse of the outside world. Throughout the book, many characters are mentioned as having contracted a flu-like disease, foreshadowing events in Plague. Plague Perdido Beach is now run in all but name by Albert, whose introduction of money and paid labor to the town has placed him in a position of considerable power. With water supplies dwindling, Albert sends Sam, Dekka, Jack and Taylor to find a new water source at Lake Tramonto, on the far side of the FAYZ. Meanwhile, a plague that causes those infected to cough up their insides spreads through Perdido Beach, and the town's inhabitants are instructed not to leave their homes to stop the spread. On the way to the lake, Sam's group encounters Hunter, who has become infested with parasitic bugs which have begun to eat him from the inside out. At Hunter's request, Sam uses his powers to euthanize him, but in doing so releases bugs that are invulnerable to his abilities. A coyote then leads the group to the creatures that are causing the infections. The group attacks the creatures, and Dekka becomes infested in the process. Meanwhile, Drake escapes his prison after Orc becomes drunk. He makes his way to the mineshaft and is met by the bugs, which clear the way into the mineshaft. Drake transforms into Brittney, who discovers that the gaiaphage was an alien virus intended to seed planets with life before mutating due to exposure to radiation and human DNA. With Brittney now accepting the gaiaphage as her god, Drake and the bugs split into two armies to attack Sam and Perdido Beach. Orc, ashamed of his actions, takes refuge at Coates with Astrid, who believes that killing Pete will end the FAYZ and worries that the other children will kill him. Sam's group arrive at a nearby military airbase and encounter a lone boy, Toto, whose mutant power is to tell truth from lies. Sam's group discover that the military was tracking the various mutants before the FAYZ began. They also find a train containing valuable supplies of food, as well as a train car full of handheld missile launchers. Travelling on to the lake, Sam and his group are confronted by Drake and the bugs, which have grown to the size of SUVs. The group escapes back to the military base, with Sam sending Jack to Perdido Beach to either retrieve Caine from San Francisco de Sales or throw Pete to the bugs, assuming that Pete will be induced to use his abilities in response. Dekka attempts to use her abilities to bring the missiles to the power plant and then on to Perdido Beach, but the plan is thwarted when she begins to succumb to her infestation and drops the container. Perdido Beach erupts into chaos with the knowledge that the bugs are approaching, most mutants too far away to help, Albert near death after being attacked by the remnants of the Human Crew, and the plague having hospitalized many kids. Independently of Sam, Edilio instructs Quinn to bring Caine to Perdido Beach, as he has the power to kill the bugs. Caine accepts the challenge, hoping to become king after saving the town. The bugs arrive in Perdido Beach, and Caine teams up with Brianna to destroy most the army attacking the town, though many children are killed in the battle. Quinn rescues Sam, Toto and Dekka and brings them back to Perdido Beach, with Sam forced to cut Dekka open to stop the bugs devouring Dekka. Jack encounters Astrid and Orc at Coates, soon joined by Drake and his bugs. When threatened by Drake, Astrid throws Pete to the insects, who realizes the danger and vanishes both the insects and himself, but the FAYZ barrier remains. Caine installs himself as king of Perdido Beach, though it is clear that Albert remains the real power behind the throne. Sam forms a community at Lake Tramonto with a third of Perdido Beach decide to follow him. To Sam's shock, Diana decides to come with Sam, having become sick of Caine's constant need for power, and reveals that she is pregnant with Caine's child. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Pete's disembodied consciousness has survived the encounter with the bugs. Fear Four months after the end of Plague, Sam's new community at Lake Tramonto is flourishing. However, Sam discovers that the missile container has been booby-trapped, and suspects that Caine has already claimed the missiles. Astrid has abandoned Sam to live alone in the woods, still guilty over sacrificing Pete and unaware of his survival. Pete experiments with his new state of existence by tampering with the genetic makeup of the inhabitants of the FAYZ, resulting in several gruesome deaths. Amongst his victims is Taylor, who survives her mutation but is transformed into a gold-skinned non-mammalian creature. Astrid and several other FAYZ inhabitants discover that the energy barrier has beguns to turn black, prompting Astrid to seek Sam out at Lake Tramanto and rekindle their relationship. Sam sends a letter to Caine offering to use his powers to provide light to Perdido Beach. Meanwhile, Drake and the coyotes are sent by the gaiaphage to bring the pregnant Diana to its cave. Drake allows the coyotes eat Howard when they cross paths on the way to Lake Tramanto. This is witnessed by Sam's messenger, who instead runs back to Lake Tramanto to raise the alarm. At night, Astrid clandestinely travels to Perdido Beach alone to bring Sam's offer of aid. Meanwhile, Albert decides to flee to San Francisco de Sales to survive an anticipated societal collapse resulting from the barrier darkening; it is revealed that he has hidden the missiles on the island without telling Caine. In Perdido Beach, Caine sentences Cigar, one of Quinn's fishermen, to a day being tortured by Penny and her illusions. Cigar claws his own eyes out as a result of Penny's torture, prompting Quinn and his fishermen to go on strike and demand Penny's exile from Perdido Beach. Lana attempts to regenerate Cigar's eyes and is partially successful; however, Cigar is only able to perceive people's auras, but soon realises that he is able to see and communicate with Pete. Penny drugs Caine and encases his hands in concrete, preventing the use of his powers, but is infuriated when the frightened children of Perdido Beach clamor for his release rather than accept her leadership. Lana coerces Penny into leaving town. Astrid encounters Cigar, who reveals that Pete is alive, but Cigar is eaten by zekes soon afterwards. Through mental communication with Pete, Astrid learns that the barrier is connected to the gaiaphage and the gaiaphage needs a host body - Diana's baby - to channel its abilities. Drake takes Diana captive and brings her to the mineshaft, where they encounter Penny. Diana gives birth to her baby, which is possessed by the gaiaphage. The baby, whom Diana names Gaia, shows signs of possessing several powers, including Sam's light generation and Lana's healing abilities. Outside the FAYZ, Sam and Caine's mother, Connie Temple, has become one of the spokespeople for the families of Perdido Beach. Connie struggles with her guilt about knowing of Sam and Caine's abilities before the creation of the FAYZ. Connie learns that the army plans to nuke the barrier. She and the other children's families attempt to stop the explosion by alerting the media and the other families, but the military finds that the barrier has prevented them from stopping the detonation. Drake, Diana, Penny and a rapidly developing Gaia make for the barrier, which Gaia intends to destroy so she can escape into the outside world. They are intercepted by Sam and Caine; Caine kills Penny, prompting Gaia to attempt to kill Caine with her own telekinetic abilities. When Sam tries to destroy Gaia with his light (concurrently to the nuclear detonation), the barrier suddenly becomes transparent, allowing Connie and everyone else gathered outside the barrier to witness the confrontation. Gaia flees, followed by Diana and Drake. In the aftermath, Sam and Astrid are reunited with their parents, and communication begins between the FAYZ and the outside world. Light Two days after Fear, the inhabitants of the FAYZ have become distracted by the outside world and lose interest in their duties, which leads to Quinn returning to San Francisco de Sales to get Albert, as he is the only one who can get everyone back to work. Brianna gives an interview to a news station that reveals the level of violence experienced by the children of the FAYZ. Annoyed at Brianna, Sam and Astrid send her to search for Gaia, Diana, and Drake. Brianna encounters Drake foraging for food for Gaia; she dismembers him and scatters his parts throughout the FAYZ, keeping his head in a chest below the boats on Lake Tramonto. Gaia schemes to kill the FAYZ residents in order to prevent Pete from fighting her by inhabiting another person's body. Gaia and Diana spot two young men on the other side of the barrier; Gaia uses her power to briefly remove the barrier, causing one of the men, Alex Mayle, to fall through. Gaia removes and eats Alex's arm and informs Alex that she will use him as food. Intimidated, Diana and Alex follow Gaia to Lake Tramanto. Diana escapes and warns the community, but Gaia appears and slaughters most of the community before being forced to retreat by Brianna. Sam and Caine join forces to kill Gaia and rescue Diana. Sam and Caine find Gaia, and their efforts to kill her result in Caine being taken hostage and Sam heavily injured, before he is rescued by Taylor and Lana. The kids regroup at Perdido Beach and discuss their next move. It is revealed that Gaia, though possessing every power of every living person in the FAYZ, loses that power when the person dies. Sam contemplates whether he must sacrifice himself in order to stop Gaia. Meanwhile, Alex brings Drake's head to Gaia; she decapitates Alex, attaches Drake's head to his body, and replaces Alex's missing arm with another tentacle. Gaia attacks Perdido Beach and kills Brianna. Jack is also killed by a stray bullet and Sam is taken prisoner. Drake captures Astrid and begins to torture her, but Astrid incapacitates him and escapes. With the situation desperate, Caine retrieves Albert's missiles and launches them at Gaia. Orc, who was fighting Gaia at the time, is killed in the blast, but Gaia survives. Realizing that there is only one option left, Caine allows Pete's consciousness to inhabit his body at the cost of his own life. Pete fights Gaia, with each destroying each other in the process, as well as the barrier. While the kids flee Perdido Beach, Sam returns alone to confront Drake. Sam finds that he has lost his ability to shoot light, but when Drake attacks he finds that his immortality and Gaia's ability to graft his head onto Alex's body has also been nullified, resulting in Drake's apparent demise. The remaining kids reunite with their families and mourn their losses. Connie tells Sam how Caine and Sam were fraternal twins, fathered by the man whose DNA had merged with the gaiaphage, and becomes distant from Sam. Edilio is forced to go into hiding to avoid being deported back to Honduras, and comes out to his family after learning that his boyfriend Roger survived the massacre at Lake Tramanto. Albert gains the attention of every major business in the world, and does an advertisement for McDonald's in Perdido Beach. Lana returns to her family in Vegas. Sam is targeted by prosecutors intending to bring him to trial for his actions in the FAYZ, and escapes hospital with Quinn's help. Astrid, Todd Chance and Jennifer Brattle hold a press conference and Astrid reveals that Caine had written a confession note prior to his death claiming that he was controlling the children of the FAYZ and was responsible for their actions. Sam crashes the conference and is reunited with Astrid. With Caine's confession muddying the waters and footage of Sam and Astrid's reunion going viral, public opinion forces Sam's release. Astrid decides to write a book about life in the FAYZ and signs off the movie rights to the Brattle-Chances. With the money, Astrid buys a house for herself and Sam next door to Quinn's family. After the survivors attend a memorial to all those who died in the FAYZ, Sam and Astrid ask Diana to live with them, to which she agrees. Monster Four years after the collapse of the FAYZ, more \\"Anomalous Space Objects\\" (meteors carrying the gaiaphage virus), head towards Earth, mutating anyone with whom it comes into contact. Amongst those affected are genius teenager Shade Darby, who was present when the FAYZ fell and witnessed Gaia kill her mother, and her new best friend Cruz Rojas, a trans girl with a difficult home life. Shade becomes capable of morphing into an insectoid creature with super-speed, while Cruz gains the ability to turn invisible or alter her appearance. Callous artist Justin DeVeere is also exposed to ASO rock and morphs into the giant crustacean-like beast \\"Knightmare\\", destroying an aeroplane and the Golden Gate Bridge. Elsewhere, schizophrenic teenager Vincent Vu obtains ASO rock contaminated by starfish and densovirus genetic material and becomes capable of growing into a giant monstrous form able to control reanimated human bodies. The various mutants, dubbed \\"Rockborn\\", are able to transform back and forth between human and mutant forms, and feel themselves continually observed by enigmatic \\"Dark Watchers\\" while morphed. Homeland Security Taskforce 66 recruits Dekka to voluntarily ingest some alien rock after revealing that Drake has survived the end of the FAYZ, hoping she can combat the various new threats. She becomes able to morph into a feline beast with the ability to project matter-shredding energies, and soon learns that the corrupt HSTF-66 has abducted and experimented upon numerous people to build a mutant army. Dekka escapes along with Aristotle \\"Armo\\" Adamo, a youth with oppositional defiant disorder given a polar bear-like morph form. Dekka and Armo briefly seek refuge in Perdido Beach, where they reunite with Diana. Meanwhile, HSTF-66's leader Tom Peaks is fired by the government, prompting him to vengefully ally with Drake and ingest ASO rock, gaining a dragon-like form capable of vomiting napalm. Shade and Cruz become fugitives from HSTF-66, joined by Shade's equally intelligent ex-boyfriend Malik Tenerife, and Shade fights Justin, who is subsequently captured by HSTF-66. Shade, Cruz and Malik then ally with Dekka and Armo to get to another ASO before Peaks and Drake, leading to a vicious fight interrupted by Vincent, who subdues Peaks before escaping. Malik is fatally burned in the fight between Vincent and Peaks, but Shade and Cruz give him some ASO rock in the hope of saving him. Sam provides sanctuary to Dekka and Armo. A governmental memo reveals that the mutants now occupy the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted, joined by an unknown person named Francis Specter. Villain Warning Sam and Astrid (who are now married) that Drake is still at large, Dekka secretly provides Astrid with the rest of Shade's ASO rock so she can become Rockborn in order to fight Drake. The horrifically burned Malik gains the ability to morph into an illusory version of his unharmed body, at the cost of projecting unbearable pain to other people and leaving him constantly feeling the Dark Watchers' attention. Shade, Cruz and Malik invade HSTF-66's \\"Ranch\\" facility, destroying much of the building and freeing Justin and the other mutant captives, and Shade livestreams footage to expose the organisation's crimes. Aspiring comedian and FAYZ survivor Dillon Poe buys ASO rock on the black market and gains a reptilian morph with the ability of mind control. His love interest Saffron Silverman inspires him to try to take over the world, and they seize control of thousands of people in Las Vegas, causing mass carnage and the deaths of thousands, including Saffron. Dekka and Armo regroup with Shade, Cruz and Malik, and they engage Dillon and his enthralled forces in a battle, discovering he cannot control other Rockburn while they are morphed. They are joined by Francis Specter, a teenager who has the ability to turn intangible by passing into a fourth- dimensional plane. As Francis does not feel the Dark Watchers observing her, Malik identifies her as an anomalous Rockborn that could pose a threat to the Watchers. The military invades Vegas to stop Dillon, who sends his slaves in kamikaze attacks against them. On his way to Vegas to join the carnage, Vincent is killed by the army. Dillon takes many people hostage and douses them in gasoline. Intending to regain the government's trust, Peaks travels to Vegas but inadvertently ignites the hostages with his napalm, killing most of them, though Dekka and her allies are able to save a few. Malik uses his pain- projecting powers to torture Dillon and coerces him into committing suicide, freeing everyone under his control. Dekka, Shade, Cruz, Malik, Armo and Francis form a superhero team, the \\"Rockborn Gang\\", and Cruz becomes their public spokesperson after she is seen saving a baby from the flames, while Shade and Malik resume their relationship. Hero Various ASOs have landed across Earth, to the point where most countries are becoming overwhelmed by the emergence of destructive Rockborn. Stricken with guilt over his role in Dillon's massacre, Peaks commits suicide. To prevent a particularly large ASO from obliterating New York, the government fires nuclear missiles at it to break it up, but this still results in many shards hitting New York, killing or infecting much of the city. Many of those infected are abducted and massacred by government forces, but businessman Bob Markovic and his daughter Simone escape using their morphs: Markovic becomes a gestalt swarm of insects capable of inflicting horrific and agonising diseases upon humans while rendering them unable to die, while Simone becomes able to fly in the form of a blue humanoid with many tiny wings. The power-hungry Markovic, now calling himself \\"Vector\\", infects New York's government and seizes control of the city, recruiting a small army of Rockborn to assist him, including Justin. Discovering Astrid has become Rockborn, Sam ingests the rest of Shade's ASO. He becomes able to create domes of various sizes resembling the FAYZ, while she can morph into a Hulk-like form with super strength and invulnerability. Drake ambushes Astrid, but Astrid easily overpowers him with her new abilities and dissolves him in hydrofluoric acid. Forming an uneasy alliance with the US government, the Rockborn Gang, with Dekka as their official leader, travel to New York to stop Markovic, joined by Simone, Sam and Edilio. Francis strands Justin and some of Markovic's other Rockborn in the fourth dimension, which she dubs \\"Over There\\". Markovic tries to reach Washington to conquer the government, but he is trapped by Sam's abilities and the Rockborn Gang kill him with nerve gas. However, Shade is almost killed in the battle, while Sam is forced to destroy a train, killing over forty of Markovic's hostages. Cruz and Armo begin a relationship, and Simone becomes romantically interested in Dekka. A military general helps Dekka, Shade, Cruz, Malik, Armo, Francis, Sam, Astrid, Simone and Edilio go into hiding at a secret bunker, and they agree to consider helping deal with other villainous Rockborn. The conclusion of Hero reveals the truth about the entirety of the universe depicted throughout the nine books. Malik accompanies Francis in a series of excursions to Over There, and he and Shade theorise that their reality is a simulation created by the Dark Watchers. Malik and Francis' final excursion brings them in contact with a future version of Malik, who confirms his younger self's suspicions and notes that Pete was the only other person to discover the nature of their reality. The older Malik explains that the FAYZ universe was created by an MIT team led by him and Shade 26 years in the future using artificial intelligence and based on their own memories. Although the older Malik acknowledges the suffering felt by those in the simulation, he explains that it cannot be altered, but can be switched off, ending their universe. Malik refuses to make the decision without unanimous approval of the Rockborn Gang. The series ends with the Rockborn Gang about to vote, with the ultimate fate of their universe left unknown. ==Characters== * Sam Temple - the main protagonist of the series. Caring, determined, and reliable, Sam is extremely respected in the FAYZ. Sam receives supernatural power in the form of being able to generate light from his hands. This light can either be to illuminate a dark area or as a lethal weapon. Throughout the series, Sam is constantly pushed to his limits physically and mentally. As the series goes on, Sam frequently encounters challenges that he is the only one capable of dealing with, leaving a large sense of pressure on him at all times. Sam is also a frequent adversary of Caine, his twin brother, before the two ally against the Gaiaphage. Sam's nemesis is Drake Merwin, and the two battle many times before the FAYZ falls. Sam is also in an ongoing relationship with Astrid throughout the series. before the FAYZ Sam was a hero after saving the school bus from crashing when the driver has a heart attack he then becomes one of the most important people in Perdido Beach after the barrier appears. * Caine Soren - born David Temple, the twin brother of Sam Temple and a primary antagonist throughout most of the series. Narcissistic, charismatic, intelligent, and ruthless, Caine seeks power over others and attempts to take control of the FAYZ multiple times throughout the series. Caine gains supernatural powers in the form of telekinesis. He is one of the most powerful mutants in the FAYZ. He has a recurring romantic interest in Diana, which results a child, Gaia. Throughout the series, Caine becomes increasingly heroic, ultimately joining Sam in the fight against the Gaiaphage. Caine eventually dies in the final confrontation with the monster and the destruction of the barrier. * Astrid \\"the Genius\\" Ellison - often referred to as the smartest person in the FAYZ. An honor student and a devout Christian, Astrid gained her nickname \\"Astrid the Genius\\" before the barrier manifested. Caring, intelligent, and ambitious, Astrid often is behind much of the policymaking in the FAYZ. Her knowledge of politics and science makes her the foremost authority on a variety of issues, making her an extremely important figure in the community. Astrid is also the older sister of Peter \\"Little Pete\\" Ellison; her role as caretaker for him throughout the series takes a constant toll on Astrid. Throughout much of the series, Astrid is in an ongoing relationship with Sam Temple, which continues after the barrier falls. * Diana Ladris - a skilled manipulator whose power to determine other mutants' power levels make her a valuable asset and political ally. Diana often plays the part of both protagonist and antagonist in the series. Starting as one of Caine's henchmen, she slowly starts to try and distance herself from villainy as the series goes on. She is the mother of Gaia Ladris-Soren, the only baby born in the FAYZ. Diana is in a strained relationship with Caine through most of the series, thus motivating her switch between hero and villain multiple times. * Lana Arwen Lazar - one of the most important and respected persons in the FAYZ, Lana has the ability to heal any injury. Brooding, sulky, and sometimes hostile, Lana views the role of healer to be a burden. Lana is also one of the few to have a profound connection with the Gaiaphage, making it a constant adversary for her. Throughout the series, Lana is seen mostly as a loner and often goes on missions of her own. * Albert Hillsborough - a fourteen-year-old African-American student in charge of food, water, and work in Perdido Beach. He is considered by many to be the most responsible person in the FAYZ. Known for his wealth and for controlling the food and water, he also is known for creating markets in the FAYZ. Although he is clever and powerful, Albert is selfish and somewhat of a coward, as evidenced by him running away when the barrier turns dark. Albert is the inventor of the official currency of the FAYZ. At the dawn of the FAYZ, Albert takes control of the local McDonald's and begins to provide the community with food. As the series progresses, Albert becomes a business tycoon, gathering countless children under his employment. As his power and influence grows, Albert becomes less and less agreeable, making him sometimes an antagonist. * Peter \\"Little Pete\\" Ellison - Astrid's severely autistic younger brother. The most important individual person in the FAYZ, with numerous abilities demonstrated throughout the series ranging from telekinesis and teleportation to creating life, he is also the one who created it. He is constantly fighting the gaiaphage and stopping it from taking over the FAYZ and its inhabitants throughout the series. The FAYZ wall only comes down when Pete chooses to die during the final battle with Gaia. During the series, all the actions he takes are directed only to solve an immediate problem of his, and he does not comprehend any effects his actions may have on people in the future. * Brianna \\"The Breeze\\" Berenson - one of Sam's best friends, Brianna has the power to run at superhuman speeds, boasting that she is capable of outrunning a speeding bullet. Brianna is brave and fearless, often enthusiastically tangling with Caine and Drake, but her bravado ultimately proves to be her downfall when Gaia attacks the people of the FAYZ. * Computer Jack - the tech master of the FAYZ, whose passion for technology often leads him to make morally dubious decisions before he ultimately allies with Sam. Jack becomes involved in a complicated relationship with Brianna. * Dekka Talent - an African-American lesbian girl who intimidates most of the kids not only because of her close relationship with Sam, but also for her power to cancel gravity in a small area. Dekka has unrequited love for Brianna, which initially causes awkwardness between the two friends. * Edilio Escobar - a Honduran illegal immigrant who proves himself to be essential to the running of the FAYZ, despite having no mutant abilities. Determined, sensitive, and brave, Edilio is shown as Sam Temple's right-hand man, and later as his equal, showing extreme loyalty and resolve in the most dangerous of situations. Later in the series he is revealed to be gay, entering a relationship with \\"The Artful\\" Roger. A recurring joke is Edilio often being mistaken for Mexican, a joke which he occasionally makes himself. * Quinn Gaither - Sam's best friend before the FAYZ. When the FAYZ occurs, Quinn betrays Sam to Caine but frees him after learning of Caine's intentions. During the food shortage plaguing the FAYZ, Quinn takes the initiative to start fishing, ultimately leading Perdido Beach's fishing crew. * Drake \\"Whip Hand\\" Merwin - a violent, sadistic, misogynistic psychopath who begins the series as Caine's right hand before coming to serve the gaiaphage, who regenerates his burned arm as a 10-foot-long tentacle which he can use to whip or strangle people. Despite apparently being killed by Caine in Hunger, part of Drake's tentacle bonds to Brittney, a mutant with the power of immortality, allowing the two to share a body. * Gaia \\"The Gaiaphage\\" Soren-Ladris - the daughter of Diana Ladris and Caine Soren. The only baby born in the FAYZ, Gaia is possessed by the Gaiaphage almost immediately after her birth. Gaia quickly grows into a child and becomes the second-most powerful mutant in the FAYZ, behind Little Pete. Her malice and affinity for carnage make her an immediate threat to the children of the FAYZ. Gaia can use the abilities of any mutant in the FAYZ, though that power disappears when the mutant dies. * Charles \\"Orc\\" Merriman - nicknamed so for his gargantuan size and limited intelligence, Orc is the original school bully in Perdido Beach. Closely accompanied by his friend Howard Bassem at all times, Orc begins the series as an antagonist. His lack of fear and empathy cause him to accidentally kill a mutant, Bette, the guilt of which causes him to become an alcoholic before becoming a born-again Christian. After being mauled by coyotes, Orc's skin is replaced by a gravel- like substance that makes him almost immune to pain and incredibly strong. * Brittney Donegal - a devout Christian seemingly killed in Hunger, who discovers she has the ability of immortality. Initially believing that her ability is a divine gift to kill Caine and Drake, Brittney becomes bonded with Drake and shares her body with him, and is manipulated by the gaiaphage into accepting it as her god. ==Critical reception== Reviews have generally been mixed to positive, though many note Gones success in its intended demographic. Mal Peet, for The Guardian, pointed to the series' \\"rave reviews, most of them posted on websites by teenagers\\", though noting that such success stemmed from literary sacrifices that made characters into \\"crude two-dimensional digitisations\\". Amanda Craig, for The Times, noted that Gone was \\"heavily influenced by TV series such as Lost and Heroes, and described the book as \\"Clever but a little too predictable.\\" Jayne Howarth, for the Birmingham Post, called Gone \\"superb\\" and said she found the book \\"full of suspense, action and the supernatural. Think of a potent mix of Lord of the Flies, Heroes and Lost and you get an idea of the audience this will appeal to.\\" Describing the pace of the novel as \\"frantic and frenetic\\" Howarth summed up: \\"This is an incredible mystery story, with twists and turns, cameos and protagonists, to keep readers engrossed... Violent in parts, Grant does not hold back at showing the feral nature of humans when faced with a world without order. Unputdownable.\\" Dinah Hall, reviewing Lies for The Sunday Telegraph, also drew comparison with Lord of the Flies and Lost, and wrote: \\"While it's never going to make it on to the GCSE syllabus, it definitely has the addictive pull of a cult television series... I would sell my soul for the next installment.\\" Toby Clements, reviewing Hunger for The Daily Telegraph, wrote: \\"Grant's world is hard-edged but thought-provoking, a Stephen King novel for youngsters in which the children are challenged with reshaping society while fighting off evil. Hunger ought to be required reading for any teenager who thinks adults suck.\\" Stephen King has also praised the series, writing: \\"These are exciting, high- tension stories told in a driving, torrential narrative that never lets up. There are monsters, there are kids with mad-crazy super powers, there's the mystery of where all the adults went. Most of all, there are children I can believe in and root for.

Feist. It is the first book in The Serpentwar Saga and was first published in June 1994. It was followed by Rise of a Merchant Prince which was published in 1995. ==Plot introduction== A dark queen is gathering armies in remote lands and desperate men are sent on a suicidal mission to confront this evil. Among these men is Nakor the Isalani, a gambler who knows the true nature of the Queen and whom everyone must wager their lives upon. ==Plot summary== The prologue introduces the Saaur, warm-blooded humanoid reptiles, whose world is being overrun by demons from the Fifth Circle of Hell. The survivors allied themselves reluctantly with their cold-blooded cousins, the Pantathians, to escape to Midkemia in exchange for a generation of service. The novel starts by introducing best friends Erik Von Darkmoor, an apprentice blacksmith and bastard son of the local baron, and Roo Avery, a local trouble maker. Erik's half-brother Stefan Von Darkmoor, heir to his father's title, who resents Erik's claim to the Darkmoor name, rapes Erik's close friend Rosalyn in an attempt to force Erik into a fight. Erik and Roo find Stefan, and in a rage, Erik holds Stefan down while Roo delivers the killing blow, but Erik is injured during the fight. Now wanted for Stefan's murder, the two realize they must flee, and set out for Krondor. On the way, the boys narrowly escape detection when they happen upon the tent of a strange woman named Gert who aids them. They wake the next morning to find Gert gone and a mysterious woman named Miranda in her place, who helps and heals Erik. Further on their journey, they come to the aid of a man who is being ambushed by some brigands. The man, a merchant named Helmut Grindle, guides them the rest of the way to Krondor. On their journey, Roo befriends the man, questioning him on all matters commerce with the goal of starting a business of his own. When they arrive in Krondor there is a long line on the road into the city, due to the search for the two murderers as well as the rush to reach the city to attend the funeral of Prince Arutha. They hide in a nearby farm and then in a tavern where they are first kidnapped by local slavers, then caught by constables, and sentenced to hang. Their hanging is faked, though, along with several other condemned men, and the group is taken to a man named Robert de Loungville, where they are informed that their sentence has not been commuted, only delayed, and that they can only hope to gain freedom in exchange for service to the crown on an extremely dangerous mission. They are taken to a training camp where they are quickly trained as soldiers. There, they meet their mysterious captain for the first time, the half-elven Calis, as well as encountering Miranda again. They sail across the Endless Sea aboard the Trenchard's Revenge and the Freeport Ranger, to the continent of Novindus, where they must pose as a mercenary group known as \\"Calis' Crimson Eagles\\" and attempt to join the army of the Emerald Queen. Their mission is to gather information and assess the Queen's motives. Her army is slowly conquering the entire continent in a bloody campaign, city by city. Meanwhile, Miranda seeks the aid of Pug in the coming conflict, forming a close bond with the great magician. After meeting up with their allies among the natives, Calis and his band successfully infiltrate the army. They discover the Emerald Queen's plans to become a host for a Valheru spirit trapped within several ancient artifacts, then lead her army across the sea to invade the Kingdom of the Isles. When their ruse is discovered, the Crimson Eagles are pursued by the 9-foot-tall Saaur cavalry, only to flee into the secret lair of the Pantathian priests. At great cost, Calis finds his way to the inner chambers and manages to destroy the artifacts. The diminished crew manage to escape to a nearby city under siege by the Emerald Queen. They manage to destroy the shipyards, key to the Queen's plot, and while the invasion is not prevented completely, it is delayed significantly. The surviving members of the group are picked up by Prince Nicholas aboard the Freeport Ranger, and return to Krondor as free men. ==Publication history== Since its release in 1994 Shadow of a Dark Queen has been released in over 15 countries and in over 10 different languages.

It is on a five-acre (2 ha) parcel owned by the nearby city of Newburgh, formerly used for police K-9 training. The house now sits abandoned and in a state of decay. It was built in 1790, although it is not known by whom. Patton, a prominent local farmer and landowner, bought the property as a young man a quarter-century later. It assumed its present form after several additions and renovations in the first 40 years of its existence. In 2008 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Property== The house is a -story five-bay frame structure facing the road to the south, on a lot that slopes slightly up to and past it. Its front facade has four windows and a centrally located entranceway with wooden steps leading up to a covered porch. The raised foundation is of mortared fieldstone with some attempt at an ashlar pattern on the corners. The roof is a steeply pitched and gabled. Two brick chimneys rise from it. A small stone lean-to was added on to the east at a later date. On the west are two exposed firebacks. The interior has undergone more extensive renovation than the exterior, most recently for use as a police training facility. Beyond the room modified to serve as a classroom, many of the original finishes, the original plaster and decoration remains. The fireplace mantels have Federal style Tuscan colonettes with frieze and entablature, and the unusual rear- facing open-stringer staircase has a pyramidal newel post and oval handrails. There are several contributing resources to the rear of the house. A two-story wooden barn is believed to date to 1880, and the remains of a stone smokehouse and another unidentified structure are nearby. The pattern of their stonework is similar to the lean-to on the east elevation, suggesting all three were built around the same time in the early 19th century. An old well and stone walls complete the original farmstead property. ==History== At the time of its original construction, the house was a more modest structure, less deep and less wide. In the early 19th century, it is believed, the house was expanded to its present size and the first floor reconfigured more in keeping with the Federal style houses beginning to come into style. Some traces of this expansion can still be seen on both the interior and exterior. Patton, who had been born and raised a short distance away, bought the house and surrounding farmland that was to eventually reach by 1830, possibly in 1825. He married around that time and began the house's last remodeling, adding the Federal decorative touches inside and other changes to make it a better home for his growing family. He distinguished himself in the Newburgh-area business community, helping to establish two banks, and served in several town offices. In 1860 his holdings were valued at $20,000 ($ in 2008 dollars). His son William returned to the farm with his own family in 1880 to help his aging father. By 1900, after the older man's death, William and the family and their servants had returned to Montgomery Street in Newburgh. He still owned the farm, but his workers lived in the house. James Patton's land were slowly subdivided and sold in the early years of the 20th century. By the time the city of Newburgh acquired the land as part of the expansion of its Lake Washington reservoir to the north, only were left. Eventually the city converted it to its present use as a police training facility. ==Aesthetics== Colonial-era houses in the Hudson Valley often strongly reflect either English or Dutch building traditions, sometimes combining both, as in the Bull Stone House in nearby Hamptonburgh. After independence, the Dutch-style stone houses faded from popularity in favor of more traditional English styles, which the Patton house largely reflects. The -story height, however, is a Dutch style, perhaps the only one that continued to be in use. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Houses in Orange County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, New York Category:Houses completed in 1790 Category:New Windsor, New York Category:Buildings and structures in New Windsor, New York ","title":"James &quot;Squire&quot; Patton House"},{"id":"19354465","text":"The color pink has notable tints and shades.

During the storm, waves on Lake Superior in Duluth were reportedly over 20 feet high with water temperature around 36 degrees. Gale-force winds gusted to 45 mph. Around 7:45 p.m., a witness reported to the Duluth Police Department that three boys (Eric, Nathan and Arthur Halverson) were at the end of the pier when one was washed into the water by a large wave. The other two were stranded at the end of the pier by high winds and waves. The police department contacted the Coast Guard lifeboat station in Duluth for assistance. Culbertson was a 31-year-old native of Ferndale, Michigan, a veteran of the Korean War and had served in the Coast Guard since 1952. He and two other Coast Guardsmen, Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Richard R. Callahan, 21, of Cicero, Illinois and Fireman Ronald C. Prei, 21, of St. Francis, Wisconsin, volunteered to attempt a rescue. After arriving at the pier, they tethered themselves together with a rope spaced 25 feet apart and began searching the pier with a lantern. They struggled to the end of the pier, but did not find the missing boys who had already been swept over the side. As Culbertson, Callahan and Prei returned along the pier, another large wave crashed over the wall, knocking Culbertson over the side. His body was later found on the beach. A permanent marker honoring Culbertson was placed on the pier by the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center near the spot where he perished.The Historical Marker Database He is one of only two Coast Guardsmen to have died in the line of duty while serving in Minnesota on Lake Superior. EN3 Keith Brubaker fell overboard and perished on July 11, 1967 while serving the Coast Guard Station North Superior in Grand Marais, Minnesota.U.S. Coast Guard Historians Office A bronze plaque erected later in 1967 was removed in the early 1980s when the pier was widened and reinforced. Tom Mackay, then a captain for the Vista Fleet and president of the International Shipmasters Association (ISMA) Twin Ports Lodge #12, realized after the pier improvements were finished that the plaque had not been reinstalled.WCCO News - Duluth Remembers Massive Storm He rallied the ISMA for assistance and the plaque was found and reinstalled on the new pier. Culbertson, Callahan and Prei were awarded the Coast Guard Medal, the highest peacetime medal awarded in recognition of heroism. At the time, it had only been awarded to 44 people.U.S. Coast Guard Medal list ==Coast Guard Medal citation== For heroism on the evening of April 30, 1967 while engaged in searching for two teen-age boys reportedly stranded at the Duluth Entry North Breakwater Light, Minnesota. Twin 16-year-old boys and a 17-year-old brother had been seen running along the jetty challenging the 10- to 15-foot waves when witnesses observed a huge wave sweep one boy into the water. When two boys were reported stranded at the light, Petty Officer CULBERTSON and two comrades volunteered to attempt the rescue. Lashing themselves together, the three men proceeded, with hand lanterns as the only illumination, to the end of the breakwater. Despite the high waves, winds gusting to 40 knots, driving rain and 36-degree water, the rescue party diligently searched the breakwater and light but found no trace of the boys. While returning to the beach a 20-foot wave swept Petty Officer CULBERTSON off his feet and hurled him up to and over the breakwater parapet into the sea. Despite the strenuous efforts of his teammates, Petty Officer CULBERTSON perished in this gallant rescue attempt. His outstanding courage, intrepidity, initiative, and unselfish actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard. ==Legacy== National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Petty Officer Edgar Culbertson has been selected for inclusion on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC during National Police Week in May 2010.

Floor plan of the White House second floor showing location of the Center Hall. The Center Hall is a broad central hallway on the second floor of the White House, home of the President of the United States. It runs east to west connecting the East Sitting Hall with the West Sitting Hall. It allows access to the elevator vestibule, East and West Bedrooms, the Grand Staircase, Yellow Oval Room, the first family's private living room, and the president's bedroom. In the early 20th century, William Howard Taft decorated the hall with exotic plants and art he had brought with him from his tenure as Governor-General of the Philippines. Later, Woodrow Wilson watched motion pictures here as the present White House theater was still a cloakroom. Furnishings include an American manufactured painted wood Neoclassical suite including a settee, six armchairs and four side chairs that once belonged to President James Monroe. The suite was reupholstered in a wool and silk velvet faux tiger print during the administration of George W. Bush and moved to the Center Hall from the Yellow Oval Room. Also in the room is a Louis XVI mahogany cylinder desk acquired for the Red Room during the administration of President John F. Kennedy. A pair of bronze French Empire caryatid torch√®res from Ch√¢teau de Malmaison were originally acquired for the Blue Room by Kennedy decorator St√©phane Boudin. == Further reading == * Abbott, James A.

She has been described as ethereal, dark, intense and quirky, while her musical style has been described as \\"early 21st century electro-dance-pop of London proper\\".Billboard Album Review Scattergood's debut album, self-titled, was released in spring 2009 in the United Kingdom and United States. It received mixed but generally positive reviews. Arrows was Scattergood's second studio album, it was produced by Ken Thomas and Jolyon Thomas and released in Autumn 2013. Arrows received positive reviews in the media with The Independent, Rolling Stone and Mojo each awarding it four stars. ==Early years== Polly Scattergood was born on 18 October 1986 in Wivenhoe, Essex, England. She grew up near Colchester, the eldest of three siblings with two younger brothers. Despite misunderstanding in the press, her name Scattergood is her family name. It means \\"here today, gone tomorrow\\". Her mother was an artist and her father an actor. Scattergood's first memory of making music was playing a toy piano when she was aged four. Aged 12, having listened to Suzanne Vega's song \\"Luka\\", Scattergood concluded, \\"Music doesn't have to be strident to carry a strong message\\" and \\"That you don't have to shout. You can say things and people will listen if they want to.\\" She has stated she would often listen to Leonard Cohen as a teenager. Aged 16 she moved to London to attend the BRIT School, a performing arts academy. ==Musical career== After graduation she caught the attention of music industry executive Neil Ferris who took on her management. Ferris then introduced Scattergood to Daniel Miller head of Mute Records. He led her to the producer of her debut album Simon Fisher Turner. Scattergood describes herself as a storyteller. \\"I write about emotions and moments, not all are biographical.\\" Scattergood's debut single entitled \\"Glory Hallelujah\\" was released in 2005 on Ark Records and produced by Greg Walsh. Her September 2007 single \\"Nitrogen Pink\\" was released on Mute Records. The single \\"I Hate the Way\\" which was written on a toy keyboard was released on 22 September 2008 on both limited edition 10 inch vinyl and iTunes. The song has been described as \\"documenting her emotional instability and penchant for going to bed with unsuitable men\\". On 10 November 2008, Scattergood was a guest on the Rob da Bank show where three of her songs were played (\\"I Hate the Way\\", \\"Untitled 27\\" and \\"Nitrogen Pink\\"). Da Bank called her \\"The Kate Bush of the 21st century\\". On 28 November, she played an acoustic set on the Janice Long show (\\"I Hate the Way\\", \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"I've Got a Heart\\"). When asked about her discovery of music, she replied, \\"I found a guitar when I was about 12, in the coat cupboard, it had maybe 3 strings on it ... I just taught myself\\". Her eponymous debut studio album, Polly Scattergood, was released 9 March 2009 in the UK. and on 19 May in the US. \\"Other Too Endless\\" was released as a single from the album on 23 February 2009. It was named \\"record of the week\\" on the Steve Lamacq show. The download version features a remix by Vince Clarke who is a member of Erasure, ex Yazoo and ex Depeche Mode. iTunes made it 'Single of the Week' on 30 March 2009. \\"Please Don't Touch\\" was her fourth single, released on 4 May 2009. February 2009 saw Scattergood playing several clubs and hosting her own club night. She then re-released \\"Nitrogen Pink\\" and released \\"Bunny Club\\" as singles. On 7 March 2009 Scattergood gave a live studio session on the BBC Radio 2 Dermot O'Leary show. Her cover version of \\"Puff, the Magic Dragon\\" proved to be popular with listeners, introducing many for the first time to the artist. An EP of the iTunes performance was released in August 2009 on iTunes. She supported Amanda Palmer in September 2009 at Union Chapel, Islington. In 2011 Scattergood recorded a cover of \\"New York New York\\" for EA Games \\"The Wall\\" trailer. It premiered in Time Square, \\"The Wall\\" trailer won the Mi6 Gold award for \\"Best Use of Sound\\" and the Mi6 Silver award for \\"Best Game Footage Trailer. In 2012 she remixed the M83 song \\"Reunion\\". Scattergood released her critically acclaimed second studio album, Arrows, on 22 October 2013. The album was produced by Ken Thomas who has previously worked with Sigur R√≥s and M83 and consists of 10 songs, including singles,\\"Disco Damaged Kid\\" \\"Wanderlust\\" and \\"Cocoon\\", as well as a reworked version of the previously available song, \\"Silver Lining\\". \\"Disco Damaged Kid\\" won the public vote on 6 Music's roundtable. \\"Wanderlust\\" was remixed by Charli XCX and \\"How to Dress Well\\" featured in America's Billboard magazine. The album was well received and awarded four stars by Mojo, The Independent and Rolling Stone magazine. Scattergood supported Mute labelmates Goldfrapp at the summer series 2013 concerts at Somerset House, London on 20 July 2013. She also played two sold out nights at London's Madam Jojo's. After Arrows was released Scattergood decided to team up with her label mate James Chapman, aka the Mercury Nominated artist Maps, to write and record a joint project, entitled \\"onDeadWaves\\". The seeds of this creative partnership were sown in 2011 at a special Mute label night at London's Roundhouse. The event saw combinations of Mute artists pairing up to perform each other's song. Though both Chapman and Scattergood had primarily worked alone before there was a natural chemistry between the two of them on stage and they were encouraged by Mute to try a formal collaboration in the studio, which eventually led in 2016 to the release of the ‚ÄòonDeadWaves‚Äô album. The album was received positively by both fans and media alike, with Chapman and Scattergood playing several sold-out shows and supporting M83 on the latter's 2016 UK Tour. After the ‚ÄòonDeadWaves' album was released Scattergood was approached by Bruce Woolley, who along with Trevor Horn, was one of the original writers of the Buggles' track, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". Woolley was keen to re-record a new version of the track and wanted Scattergood to collaborate with him and the Radio Science Orchestra to supply vocals for this new recording, which was eventually to be titled \\"Dark Star\\". This new version was released by Grammaphone records in 2017. After this Scattergood desired a change of scenery and decided to move out of her London home and relocate to the Canary Islands for the winter. It was here that she began writing the lyrics that would eventually form the basis of her next solo album. Now back from the desert and living in the UK, Scattergood features on ‚ÄòAnd All Went Dark‚Äô, a track from Chris Liebing‚Äôs forthcoming debut album for Mute Records. Scattergood's latest studio album, In This Moment was scheduled for release on 1 May 2020, but was released on 3 July 2020, after being rescheduled. ==Discography== Studio albums {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Year !rowspan=\\"2\\" Album !

Hakubunkan entered the publishing arena by printing a nationalist magazine as well as expanding into printing, advertising, paper manufacturing, and related businesses, becoming one of Japan's largest publishing companies in the process. Hakubunkan Shinsha's primary business is now publication of various diaries, journals, and day planners, especially those from the era of the original Hakubunkan company. Hakubunkan is not related to the Osaka school teaching materials company Hakubun. ==History== In 1887, founded the company in Yumi, Hong≈ç, Tokyo (now part of Hong≈ç, Bunky≈ç, Tokyo). The company was named after It≈ç Hirobumi, based on an alternate pronunciation of his given name. Hakubunkan began publishing the magazine in 1887 as well. One of the most famous stories to appear in the magazine was (also known as The Golden Demon) by Ozaki K≈çy≈ç, who based two of the characters in the play on (son of the founder of the company) and Tomiyama Tadatsugu. Hakubunkan then established T≈çky≈çd≈ç (the predecessor of T≈çky≈çd≈ç Shoten and Tohan Corporation) in 1891. The following year, T≈çky≈çd≈ç moved to Hongoku, a neighborhood of Nihonbashi in Tokyo (now located in Ch≈´≈ç). In 1893, T≈çky≈çd≈ç became a domestic and foreign news agency. At the beginning of 1895, Hakubunkan began publishing the general interest magazine . The Hakubunkan Printing Office (predecessor of Kyodo Printing) was then established in 1896. To celebrate its fifteenth anniversary, Hakubunkan opened the free private (now the Sank≈ç Library) on June 15, 1902. The library is located in the Shiba Park neighborhood of Minato Ward in Tokyo. Due to the Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923, the building which housed the headquarters of Hakubunkan was destroyed by fire, and the company relocated to the Tozaki area of Koishikawa, Tokyo (now part of Bunky≈ç Ward). After the magazine Taiy≈ç ceased publication in 1927, Hakubunkan continued to operate in the red, finally splitting into three companies in 1948: Hakuy≈´sha, K≈çy≈´sha, and K≈çbunkan. Hakuy≈´sha began using the Hakubunkan name again in 1949 before changing it again to Hakubunkan Shinsha in 1950. ==Magazines== Hakubunkan has published many magazines, including the following: *B≈çken Sekai (ÂÜíÈô∫‰∏ñÁïå, January 1908 - December 1919) was succeeded by Shinseinen. *Bungei Club (ÊñáËä∏ÂÄ∂Ê•ΩÈÉ®, January 1895 - January 1921) changed its title to from January 1921 issue, then later inherited to Shin Shumi until 1933. *Bunsh≈ç Sekai (ÊñáÁ´†‰∏ñÁïå, March 1906 - February 1921) changed its title to from January 1921 issue, then was succeeded by Shin Shumi. * * *K≈çdan Zasshi (Ë¨õË´áÈõëË™å, April 1915 - 1954) was later changed its publisher to K≈çdanzasshisha to Buny≈´kan then to Hakuy≈´sha. *Nihon Taika Ronsh≈´ (Êó•Êú¨Â§ßÂÆ∂Ë´ñÈõÜ, June 1887 - December 1894) was succeeded by Taiy≈ç. *, changed its publisher to N≈çgy≈ç Sekaisha to Hakuy≈´sha. * *Shin Seinen (Êñ∞ÈùíÂπ¥, January 1920 - July 1950) changed its publisher from Ekoda Shob≈ç to Buny≈´kan then to Hakuy≈´sha. *Shin Shumi (Êñ∞Ë∂£Âë≥, January 1922 - November 1923) *Sh≈çjo Sekai (September 1906 - October 1931) *Sh≈çnen Sekai (January 1895 - January 1933?) *, published from January 1940 as Kagaku to Kokub≈ç Tankai) *Taiy≈ç (Â§™ÈôΩ, January 1895 - February 1928) *, September 1931 - 1932) * was transferred from Yaky≈´kaisha to Hakuy≈´sha, while magazine title was changed a few times. * * List of Volumes *Â§™ÈôΩ, Volume 3 (1897) (Taiy≈ç, Volume 3 (1897)) ==References== Category:Book publishing companies in Tokyo Category:Magazine publishing companies in Tokyo Category:Printing companies of Japan Category:Publishing companies established in 1887 Category:Japanese companies established in 1887 ","title":"Hakubunkan"},{"id":"19355015","text":"Center of Donja Borina Primary school Braca Ribar Donja Borina () is a village in Serbia.

Floor plan of the White House second floor showing location of the West Sitting Hall. The West Sitting Hall is located on the second floor of the White House, home of the President of the United States. The room is entered from the second floor Center Hall on the east side of the room. The room features a large lunette window on the west wall looks out upon the West Colonnade, the West Wing, and the Old Executive Office Building. The room is used by first families as a less formal living room than the Yellow Oval Room. White House architect James Hoban's initial 1793 plan and 1814 reconstruction design both placed a double Imperial stair form here, with a single stair rising from the ground floor at the terminus of the Cross Hall and dividing to two stairs returning double runs to the east in the present space. Hoban's original plan was not built as designed, as Thomas Jefferson engaged Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1803 to reverse the orientation of the stair. Latrobe's alteration placed a double run on either side rising from the west to a landing on the east and a single run returning west to the second floor. Alterations in 1869 simplified the stair moving it along the north side of the space and allowing a sitting area to the south. Presidents and first ladies would descend to the Cross Hall below during state dinners and official entertaining. The room was mainly just a grand staircase until President Ulysses Grant had it remodeled, allowing for sitting space by the nearby window. The 1869 staircase was removed during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt as part of a reconfiguration of the White House by architect Charles Follen McKim. McKim's plan removed the west stairway entirely creating room for a much enlarged State Dining Room and moved the ceremonial stair to site of the present Grand Staircase. Eleanor Roosevelt, who screened the area off from the Central Hall, particularly enjoyed it. In the subsequent Truman reconstruction, architects enclosed the hall with solid partitions and created a living room. At that time, the kitchen elevator was extended to this floor, and the door opened into this room; the Kennedy restoration rerouted it into the little hall when the room to the north was converted into the Family Kitchen. During the Truman reconstruction the east wall was rebuilt to include framed double doors allowing the room more privacy. ==See also== * East Sitting Hall ==References Further reading == * Abbott, James A.

Like his contemporary and fellow music-hall artist Florrie Forde, Whelan was born in Melbourne, in 1875. Early in his career, Whelan moved to Western Australia, where he found fame as a singer and dancer, entertaining the miners working the gold fields. At the turn of the 20th century, he emigrated to Britain, making his debut in a novelty dance act at the Empire, Leicester Square. He rapidly honed his act, and settled on a style which would vary little over his career, although his ability to update the content of his act ensured his career was both long and successful, lasting well into his eighties. Whelan was acknowledged as one of the first entertainers to have a signature tune, appearing on-stage (and exiting at the end of his act) whistling Robert Vollstedt's waltz from Die Lustige Br√ºder (The Jolly Brothers). Immaculately dressed in bow-tie and tails, he sang, danced and played the piano. He was an excellent mimic, and adapted easily to changing vocal styles. His recording career spanned the first half of the 20th century, from The Whistling Bowery Boy in 1905 to his final recordings made in 1960. He also had minor roles in a number of British films of the 1930s and 1940s. His son was the pianist Gordon Whelan. Whelan was a member of the exclusive entertainers' fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats and served as \\"King Rat\\" for one year in 1948.

He retired from the Navy as a four-star admiral. ==Early career== Born in Dodge City, Kansas, to Edward Grant Gingrich and the former Bertha Allen, he attended the University of Kansas before receiving an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1915. He graduated from the Naval Academy on June 7, 1919, and was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy. His first assignment was aboard the battleship Pennsylvania, flagship of the Atlantic Fleet. From January 1920 to July 1921 he served as assistant communication officer on the staff of Admiral Henry B. Wilson, Jr., Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet. In August 1921 he was transferred from Pennsylvania to the newly commissioned battleship Maryland, where he remained until June 1925, when he returned to the Naval Academy for a two-year tour as an instructor in the Department of Navigation. From May 1927 to July 1930 he served as gunnery officer aboard the armored cruiser Rochester, which operated in the Caribbean Sea during interventions in Nicaragua and Haiti. He spent the next two years with the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He commanded the fleet tug Algorma from June 1932 until April 1934, then served aboard the heavy cruiser Indianapolis until June 1935. He next reported to Washington, D.C., for duty in the Navy Department's Hydrographic Office. During this tour, he helped complete a new set of precomputed tables to assist aviators and navigators in calculating their positions. Published in 1936, the new Aerial and Marine Navigation Tables were a vast improvement over the previous Ageton tables in terms of ease of calculation and accuracy, and were used for years afterward. He served as head of the Hydrographic Office's research division until 1937. From June 1937 to June 1939, he served afloat as aide and flag secretary on the staff of Commander Battleship Division 3, Battle Force, aboard the division flagship Idaho. He remained with the fleet for a third year as navigator of the battleship New Mexico. ==World War II== Naval aide to James V. Forrestal Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. Returning to Washington, he served as secretary of the General Board of the Navy before being assigned as naval aide to the inaugural Under Secretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal. Gingrich served as Forrestal's aide from August 1940 to July 1944. The responsibilities of the Under Secretary and his staff had not yet been defined when Gingrich reported to the newly sworn-in Forrestal. Asked what he would like his naval aide to do, Forrestal replied, \\"Take off your coat and get to work.\\" \\"Don't you want to check on my qualifications?\\" \\"No.\\" Gingrich's first problem was to find the Under Secretary an office in the Main Navy Building; his solution was to evict the Chief of Naval Operations from the suite adjacent to the Secretary of the Navy's office. Unlike the typical naval aide to a civilian secretary, whose duties are normally limited to managing the secretary's social schedule and office logistics, Gingrich quickly became a full-fledged policy assistant for military affairs. After Gingrich left his service, Forrestal wrote to President Harry S. Truman that \\"He was invaluable to me, being far above the ordinary officer in his understanding of the Navy's relations with the public and with civilians.\\" Gingrich's service as Forrestal's aide made him an enemy of Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, who resented Gingrich's outsized policy role and perceived Gingrich as being more loyal to Forrestal, a civilian political appointee, than to King, his uniformed superior. Gingrich crossed King more blatantly when Forrestal succeeded Frank Knox as Secretary of the Navy. King and his senior admirals had effectively excluded Knox from major war decisions by only showing him routine communications from the fleet and neglecting to present the important messages, which they handled themselves. Alerted to this practice, Gingrich advised Forrestal to go to the Navy Department communication room and examine all incoming telegrams for himself. Armed with this information, Forrestal was able to exert more influence over Navy Department operations than his predecessor, at King's expense. King eventually came to suspect that Gingrich was the √©minence grise behind many of the actions taken in Forrestal's name. Whenever the admiral passed the aide in the hallway, King would greet Gingrich with a sarcastic \\"Good morning, Commander,\\" and a deep, mocking bow. USS Pittsburgh (CA-72) USS Pittsburgh, following typhoon damage. Forrestal finally released Gingrich to fight in the Pacific theater after Gingrich protested that he was being \\"kept out of the war.\\" Assigned to fit out the new heavy cruiser Pittsburgh, he served as Pittsburgh's first commanding officer from that cruiser's commissioning on October 10, 1944, until September 3, 1945. For outstanding service in that role, he was awarded the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, and a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. On March 19, 1945, the aircraft carrier Franklin was crippled by a kamikaze attack close to the Japanese mainland. Aflame and dead in the water, Franklin was still under attack by kamikaze planes and threatening to explode when Gingrich maneuvered Pittsburgh close enough to take the burning carrier under tow, protecting Franklin with antiaircraft fire until the carrier was able to work enough speed to proceed to Pearl Harbor under its own power. For helping to rescue Franklin at great risk to his own ship, Gingrich was awarded the Silver Star \\"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity\\". As captain of Pittsburgh, Gingrich became famous for sailing his ship safely to port after 15 percent of the cruiser's length was torn off by a typhoon, an act of seamanship dubbed a \\"miracle\\" by contemporary accounts. On June 5, 1945, Pittsburgh was returning with the Third Fleet from a carrier strike against Ky≈´sh≈´ when the fleet encountered heavy weather between Okinawa and the Philippine Islands. As winds rose to and waves reached heights of , Pittsburgh was buffeted by two enormous waves that ripped off of the cruiser's bow, which tossed unpredictably in front of the ship. Gingrich immediately ordered the engines into reverse to pull Pittsburgh away from the dangerous obstacle, simultaneously trying to prevent the critically damaged ship from capsizing. Pittsburgh was saved from sinking by superlative damage control efforts by its crew, notably Gingrich's executive officer, future four-star admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr. Once the storm passed, Pittsburgh found itself in calm waters 900 miles from Guam. \\"There was nothing to it from then on,\\" Gingrich recalled. Pittsburgh arrived at Guam five days after the storm and was equipped with a temporary bow, leaving two weeks later for permanent repairs at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington. A week after Pittsburgh departed, the ship's bow was discovered afloat and towed back to Guam. The 500-mile separation between the cruiser's stern and bow led contemporary news accounts to dub Pittsburgh \\"the longest ship in the Navy.\\" Regaling the press after Pittsburgh's safe arrival in port, Gingrich declared, \\"I'm sorry I can't give you an immortal phrase to hand down to posterity. But all I said was 'reverse engines'.\\" He did not believe the fracture could be blamed on a structural fault. \\"It just took two heavy seas. It couldn't possibly have held any longer. She's a fine staunch ship. We'll get the bow fixed and go right back out again.\\" Pittsburgh remained under repair at Puget Sound when the war ended in August. Director of Naval Reserve Gingrich departed Pittsburgh in September 1945 and served briefly as chief of staff and aide to Vice Admiral John H. Towers, Commander, Second Carrier Task Force, Pacific Fleet, before being abruptly reassigned to the much less significant role of chief of personnel in Miami, Florida. The sudden transfer was viewed as a punitive exile imposed by outgoing Chief of Naval Operations King and Chief of Naval Personnel Randall Jacobs to deny Secretary Forrestal an ally in the bureaucratic battle King and Jacobs were waging against Forrestal over the direction of the postwar Navy. Forrestal resolved the conflict by replacing Jacobs with Vice Admiral Louis E. Denfeld and recalling Gingrich to Washington as Denfeld's assistant. Promoted to rear admiral, Gingrich reported to the Bureau of Naval Personnel on October 24, 1945, where he was assigned to create the postwar structure for the Naval Reserve by the incoming chief of naval operations, Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Gingrich was designated assistant chief of personnel (reserves) on December 7, 1945, and in August 1946 received the additional title of director of Naval Reserve. His plan for the postwar Naval Reserve was designed to mobilize the active and reserve fleets for an emergency within ten days, using 1,000,000 reservists of whom 200,000 would be drawn from an Organized Reserve and 800,000 from a Volunteer Reserve. ==Atomic Energy Commission== Atomic Energy Commission. On August 18, 1947, Gingrich was appointed the first director of the Division of Security and Intelligence at the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). As AEC security chief, he was responsible for the physical security of AEC installations, control of classified information, development and operation of security clearance procedures, and coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Gingrich found the job very frustrating. Shortly after leaving the position, he testified before the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy that he lacked confidence in the AEC security program, complaining that the security organization was too decentralized and its headquarters too powerless for the director to be effective. Gingrich was an early ally of AEC commissioner and security hawk Lewis Strauss. Like Strauss, Gingrich felt that his efforts to tighten security were being unjustly blocked by irresponsibly idealistic AEC leaders. He submitted numerous written protests against the employment of individuals with questionable associations, but found his reports overruled or ignored by superiors who refused to consider political ideologies such as being an \\"advanced 'liberal'\\" as disqualifying scientists from work in the atomic energy programs, and who demanded proof of membership in the actual Communist Party for evidence of a poor security risk, not just membership in organizations deemed subversive by the Attorney General. Resentful AEC security officers believed they were being caricatured as military men without a scientific background who were jumping at ghosts by considering atomic workers unsafe if they \\"did not share antiquated political beliefs,\\" a caricature perhaps grounded in incidents such as the interview of a suspended Oak Ridge National Laboratory chemist during which Gingrich \\"personally advised [the chemist] against the unfortunate practice of scientists acting outside their own field,\\" and went on to disparage scientists' \\"attitude toward security and the fuss being raised over the Negro question.\\" It later emerged that Gingrich had only been hired as AEC security chief because of a lack of viable candidates. Testifying before the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal conceded that Gingrich had no relevant background in security. Asked why the FBI had not been solicited for better qualified candidates, Lilienthal said that it had been hard to find anyone willing to accept the \\"thorny\\" task. \\"So you selected a man who had no experience of background in this work,\\" stated committee chairman Bourke B. Hickenlooper. \\"We were very pleased with the selection,\\" Lilienthal replied, adding that Gingrich had been \\"a real patriot in undertaking so difficult a task when he knew other men were unwilling to undertake it.\\" As a high-ranking AEC official, Gingrich was occasionally called upon to explain atomic energy to the public. Addressing the Annapolis Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars on April 19, 1949, Gingrich assured his audience that there had been no significant violation of security regulations in the past year and a half, and decried \\"sensational and grossly exaggerated tales\\" about \\"spies stealing atomic secrets\\" and about the hazards of atomic energy. \\"One prominent university president stated that three atomic bombs could destroy the United States. That is not true. It has been said that radioactivity will kill everyone in a city not killed by the blast of a bomb. That is not true. The effect of atomic radiation need not be fatal at all. It needs care and treatment. There is less mystery about radiation than is realized.\\" Forrestal death On March 30, 1949, Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld and Vice Chief of Naval Operations Arthur W. Radford received word that former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal was experiencing a nervous breakdown in Hobe Sound, Florida. Gingrich, who had remained close to Forrestal since serving as his wartime aide, was immediately dispatched to Forrestal's side, along with Navy psychiatrist George N. Raines. After their departure, Forrestal's friend Ferdinand Eberstadt asked the Navy not to send anyone, fearing that the arrival of too many people would overexcite Forrestal. Recalled Radford, \\"I assured Mr. Eberstadt that we could rely on John Gingrich to see that nothing of that kind happened but that it was too late to recall him. In fact, the Secretary seemed to trust Johnny and to be more relaxed with him present, and Dr. Raines stayed in the background. Johnny kept Admiral Denfeld and me informed of the situation.\\" Eberstadt arrived himself on April 1, 1949 with Dr. William C. Menninger, who recommended immediate hospitalization. \\"Jim Forrestal flew back to Washington with Johnny Gingrich and Dr. Raines; Johnny seemed to be able to exercise more control over him than anyone else.\\" Forrestal was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital for psychiatric treatment. Radford left Washington later that month to become Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Command, and Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet. Offered a position as Radford's chief of staff, Gingrich jumped at the opportunity to resume his naval career, submitting his resignation as AEC security chief on April 10, 1949, effective April 30. His letter of resignation stated that \\"the security division has been completely reorganized, adequately staffed with highly capable personnel whose duties have been properly set forth.\\" Aware of Gingrich's previous discontent, Senator William E. Jenner speculated on the floor of the Senate that Gingrich had actually \\"quit in disgust.\\" Asked by the press to comment, Gingrich claimed, \\"I resigned to accept duty as Chief of Staff in the Pacific. I was not disgruntled and I did not leave precipitately.\\" On May 22, 1949, Forrestal committed suicide at Bethesda Naval Hospital. As Forrestal's long-time friend, Gingrich accompanied Forrestal's casket from the Naval Hospital to Arlington National Cemetery and stood with the Forrestal family at the graveside during the official funeral on May 25, 1949. He joined the Pacific Fleet staff as Radford's chief of staff and aide in July 1949. ==Korean War== United Nations Blockade and Escort Force Gingrich was designated Commander Training Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet in October 1951. On May 31, 1952, he became Commander, United Nations Blockade and Escort Force. The Blockade and Escort Force (Task Force 95) was a subordinate command of United States Naval Forces, Far East, under the operational control of the Seventh Fleet. Ships from nine nations comprised the West Coast Blockade Group (Task Group 95.1), the East Coast Blockade Group (Task Group 95.2), the Escort Group (Task Group 95.5), the Minesweeping Group (Task Group 95.6), and the Republic of Korea Navy (Task Group 95.7). In addition to interdicting Korean waters against hostile and unauthorized shipping, Task Force 95 conducted shore bombardment and naval airstrikes on both coasts and maintained a continuous blockade of the North Korean port of Wonsan, the longest naval blockade of modern times. Gingrich stressed efficient use of warfighting resources. When he took over Task Force 95, he discovered that his ships were firing 51,700 rounds of 5-inch ammunition per month, mostly in unobserved fire. Worried about the massive expenditure, Gingrich insisted that targets be observed to evaluate the effect of the bombardment. \\"I wanted to know specifically what damage was done, not that 'great damage' was done.\\" The resulting improvement in targeting efficiency reduced the monthly firing rate to 15,000 rounds, representing a savings of approximately $40,000,000 over the course of a year. \\"The cost of a 5-inch shell at the end of the Korean pipeline was approximately $200,\\" he noted, so \\"unless it did that much damage, we were hurting ourselves more than the enemy.\\" For commanding the Blockade and Escort Force, Gingrich was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and decorations from the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Thailand. He was relieved by Rear Admiral Clarence E. Olsen on February 13, 1953. Chief of Naval Material As Chief of Naval Material, 1954. Promoted to vice admiral, he became deputy chief of naval operations for administration in February 1953. On August 1, 1953, he was appointed Chief of Naval Material (CNM), in which role he was responsible for all Navy procurement activities. Gingrich believed that the worst procurement problems stemmed from faulty requirement planning. \\"No matter how well we place a contract, if there was no need for the material in the first place, our procurement effort and our money have been wasted. Yet an inordinate amount of our procurement effort has been wasted in buying unneeded material and equipment.\\" \\"Placing a price tag and a material expenditure tag on the bullets we fire may represent a somewhat new concept in our modern thinking,\\" he concluded, \\"but success in future wars depends greatly upon the economy measures we utilize.\\" ==Personal life== He retired from the Navy on October 1, 1954, as a full admiral, having been automatically advanced one grade on the retired list on the basis of combat citations. One month later, he was elected a vice president of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (I.T.&T.;). In February 1957, as part of a corporate reorganization, he was appointed president of the Federal Telephone and Radio Company, an I.T.&T.; division which produced electronic equipment and components for government, military, and commercial use. He eventually returned to the parent corporation, serving as an I.T.&T.; vice president until his death. He died at his home in New York City at the age of 63, after a long illness, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He married Florence Benson in 1925 and they had one son, John Edward, Jr. He remarried to Vanetta Oliphant on July 3, 1939, and they had one daughter, Susan Alice. His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, awarded for commanding the Blockade and Escort Force; the Silver Star, awarded for assisting the damaged aircraft carrier Franklin; two awards of the Legion of Merit for commanding the cruiser Pittsburgh; and decorations from the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Thailand. ==References * John E.

It was produced by Hooligan Pictures. The New York Times described it as, \\"Not quite the campfest its absurd but undeniably catchy title suggests, Zombie Honeymoon is actually an emotionally driven blend of romance, comedy and horror.\\" The film won a Chainsaw award in 2006 for best low-budget film. Zombie Honeymoon centers around the doomed love story of Denise (Tracy Coogan) and Danny (Graham Sibley) Zanders, whose honeymoon is disrupted by an attack that turns Danny into a zombie. Denise is torn between her desire to protect her husband and her revulsion at what he is becoming. ==Plot== American newlyweds Denise and Danny have just begun their month-long honeymoon by the ocean in New Jersey when Denise witnesses a ragged man, fully clad, emerging from the water. She screams to rouse her sleeping husband, but it is too late; the zombie attacks. Holding Danny down, he vomits a black, viscous fluid into Danny's mouth before collapsing. Rushed to the hospital, Danny cannot be revived, but as the doctor is telling Denise that her husband is dead he reanimates on his own. Soon after his release, it becomes clear to Denise that all is not well. The vegetarian Danny is craving meat. When Denise finds that her husband is struggling with compulsive cannibalism, she is horrified, but compelled by love and pity to clean up after him and protect him. Her efforts to help him overcome his urges prove futile. Danny's body count mounts while his willpower deteriorates as quickly as his decomposing flesh. Though Denise has not been able to bring herself to flee her husband, even as he kills their closest friends, the remaining bonds of love that have held Danny back from killing his bride seem to have dissolved. He attacks her and forces her down, beginning to produce the viscous fluid that had transformed him. Just before infecting Denise, he turns his head, sparing her his fate. He apologizes to her as he finally dies. Denise, after tenderly disposing of his body, goes back to the beach, where she remembers better times between them and looks to the tickets that the pair had purchased to start their dream life in Portugal. ==Production== Writer/director David Gebroe has discussed the genesis of the film in several interviews and in a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature on the 2006 Showtime Entertainment DVD release. Shortly after Gebroe completed his first feature film, The Homeboy, in March 2002, his younger sister's husband died in a surfing accident.Gebroe, David. Zombie Honeymoon DVD \\"Behind The Scenes\\", Showtime Entertainment, February 14, 2006, ASIN: B000CPH9UM Many of the details in the movie mirror his sister's story, including his sister Denise's art and her plan to move to Portugal with her husband, Danny. Gebroe was inspired by her experience to write a movie which, in his words, is \\"[a]bout how terrifying it is to dedicate yourself wholly and completely to a relationship in the knowledge that one day that person might be taken from you just like that.\\" Gebroe told horror fansite Hollywood Gothique in 2005 that \\"Above everything else, [the film]...was kind of a valentine to her strength, her ability to get through her grief and keep moving in life.\\" His choice of zombies to represent \\"the cruel hand of fate\\" was inspired both by the psychobilly music which his sister and her husband enjoyed and by the 1979 film Zombie by Lucio Fulci, which he and his sister saw as young children. He also cites as influences Roman Polanski's Macbeth, David Cronenberg's The Fly and Paul Morrissey's Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. ==Notes== The video clerk was wearing a shirt with the zombie from Lucio Fulci's cult classic, Zombi, and the video tape rejected was the previous movie of the director of The Homeboy. ==Critical reception== The film has had mixed critical reception, but the writing and acting have been widely singled out for praise. Variety, which described it as a \\"strong, well-thesped pic\\", indicated that it \\"scores simultaneously as romantic, tragic, grotesque and screamingly funny.\\" Salon.com, which characterized it as \\"a highly disturbing combination of gruesome gore and earnest, tragic romance not encountered since David Cronenberg's \\"The Fly,\\" if ever, singled out for praise the acting and the script, summarizing that \\"the film's strange blend of tragedy and surreal gore, √† la Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, is surprisingly effective.\\" The New York Times notes that the film betrays its low budget, but though finding it \\"never truly engaging or frightening\\" suggests the movie is partially salvaged by \\"solid performances (especially Ms. Coogan's) and capable direction by Dave Gebroe, whose script is infused with some wickedly funny lines.\\" The Village Voice found the story derivative, if sometimes funny, but also singled out Coogan, stating that \\"if this silly retread works at all, it's because of Coogan, who comes at the creaky premise with almost Streepian commitment and who is destined, it would seem, for better things.\\" ==See also== * List of zombie films ==References * Interview with director David Gebroe * Zombie Honeymoon at Rotten Tomatoes * * Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:2004 horror films Category:2004 comedy horror films Category:2000s romantic comedy films Category:American zombie comedy films Category:Glass Eye Pix films Category:2004 films Category:2004 comedy films ","title":"Zombie Honeymoon"},{"id":"19355197","text":"Ronald (\\"Ronaldo\\") Lanzoni Campos (born August 21, 1959) is a retired long- distance runner from Costa Rica.

It is on the River Nidd, near Summerbridge, and about south-east of Pateley Bridge. The settlement originated as terraces of weavers' houses around a flax mill built by William Hebden in about 1814 on agricultural land by the River Nidd. In 1834 the mill was acquired by Francis Thorpe of Knaresborough, who renamed it New York Mill. By 1834 Thorpe was employing 150 people at the mill. In the 1870s the export of yarn declined, and the business failed in 1883. In 1889 the Gill family bought the mill, rebuilt it and replaced the old water wheels with a water turbine. In 1891 they installed a second turbine to provide the first electric light in Nidderdale. The Gills started to spin yarns of hemp for the production of twine. They modernised the mill in the 1930s, and in the 1960s started to spin artificial fibres for carpets. The Gill family sold the mill in 1968, and the new owners closed it in 1980. The property has now been converted into a small industrial estate. == References  External links == *Hartwith Heritage Group: New York Mill Category:Nidderdale Category:Villages in North Yorkshire ","title":"New York, North Yorkshire"},{"id":"19355298","text":"X Visual Shock DVD Box is an X Japan box set released on July 23, 2008.

I Want to Go Back to Michigan is a song by Irving Berlin composed in 1914. It was a moderate commercial success when it was first released with popular versions by Elida Morris and by Morton Harvey. Afterwards it became a staple on vaudeville. Its most famous performance was by Judy Garland in the film Easter Parade. == Lyrics == The ballad's lyrics employ imagery of an idyllic rural childhood juxtaposed against less appealing city life, which was a theme among some popular songs during this period of rapid urban growth in the United States. :You can keep your cabarets :Where they turn nights into days. :I'd rather be where they go to bed at nine. :I've been gone for seven weeks :And I've lost my rosy cheeks. == Composition == According to Charles Hamm in a biography of Irving Berlin, the songwriter composed \\"I Want to Go Back to Michigan\\" at a time when his ambitions were aiming past vaudeville toward musical theater and he was exercising new styles. The nostalgic reminiscence here, along with \\"Happy Little Country Girl\\" composed during the same period, was previously unknown in his work. Billy Murray, a popular singer during the period when the song was first composed, recorded it for Edison Records in 1914. == Other recordings == * The Andrews Sisters recorded it on December 3, 1947 (Decca 9-24424) * Burl Ives included the song in his album Burl Ives Sings Irving Berlin (1960). == Movies == The Avalon Boys performed an a cappella version of the song in the 1931 Laurel & Hardy film Pardon Us. Judy Garland performed the song in the 1948 film Easter Parade, which was written around a mixture of ten older and eight newly composed Irving Berlin songs. Berlin's deal with MGM for the package of songs that included \\"I Want to Go Back to Michigan\\" was $500,000 plus a percentage of box office receipts, which was an unusually advantageous contract for a songwriter and amounted to twenty percent of the film's total budget of $2.5 million.

They are used in particle accelerators for the control of chromatic aberrations and for damping the head tail instability. Two sets of sextupole magnets are used in transmission electron miscoscopes to correct for spherical aberration. The design of sextupoles using electromagnets generally involves six steel pole tips of alternating polarity. The steel is magnetised by a large electric current that flows in the coils of wire wrapped around the poles. The coils may be formed from hollow copper magnet wire that carry coolant, usually de-ionized water. The current density of such a conductor can be above 10 amps/mm2 (four times that of standard copper conductors). ==In particle accelerators== At the energies reached in high energy particle accelerators, magnetic deflection is more powerful than electrostatic, and use of the magnetic term of the Lorentz force: :\\\\mathbf{F} = q (\\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}), is enabled with various magnets that make up 'the lattice' required to bend, steer and focus a charged particle beam. The quadrupole magnets used to focus and combine the beam have the unfortunate property that their focusing strength (describable by a focal length) is dependent on the energy of the particle being focused‚Äîhigh energy particles having longer focal lengths than those with lower energy. Since all realistic beams have some, non-negligible, energy spread, any focusing scheme that relies purely on quadrupole magnets will result in the size of the beam \\"blowing up\\" with distance. In linear accelerators this is due to the under- or over-focusing of the particles, while in storage rings it is related to the chromaticity of the ring (the tendency for off-energy particles to have different values for the betatron phase advance per orbit). Typically this is controlled with the addition of sextupolar fields to the lattice. Sextupolar fields have a focal length that is inversely proportional to the distance from the center of the magnet with which the particle passes. This is similar to the action of a quadrupole, whose effect on the beam may be described as a bending whose strength depends on the distance from the center of the magnet. If a sextupole is placed at a point at which the particles in the beam are arranged by their energy offset (i.e. a region of non-zero dispersion), then the sextupole can be set at a strength that ensures that particles of all reasonable energy offsets are focused to the same point. This will negate the tendency of the quadrupole lattice to disperse the beam. ==Problems== Sextupolar fields are non-linear (i.e. they depend on the product of the sizes of the transverse displacements), and have terms which depend on both the horizontal and vertical offsets (i.e. they are coupled). This leads to equations of motion that cannot be solved for the general case, thus requiring approximations to be used when calculating their effects on the beam. In addition, the quadrature dependence of the sextupole kick on the transverse offset of the beam, can lead to high amplitude particles being kicked far from the beam axis and being lost on the beam-pipe walls. Due to this mechanism, the addition of sextupole fields to an accelerator lattice will limit the dynamic aperture or acceptance of the accelerator. ==See also== *Charged particle beam *Dipole magnet *Electron optics *Halbach cylinder *Multipole magnet *Quadrupole magnet ==References== Category:Accelerator physics Category:Types of magnets ","title":"Sextupole magnet"},{"id":"19355392","text":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories is a book of short stories published in 1991 by San Antonio-based Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros. The collection reflects Cisneros's experience of being surrounded by American influences while still being familially bound to her Mexican heritage as she grew up north of the Mexico-US border. These tales focus on the social role of women, and their relationships with the men and other women in their lives. The majority of the characters are stereotypes: men embody machismo while women are na√Øve and generally weak. Cisneros focuses on three feminine clich√©s: the passive virgin, sinful seductress, and traitorous mother. Not properly belonging to either Mexico or America, the Chicana protagonists earnestly search for their identity, only to discover abuse and shattered dreams. Apart from focusing on these issues of struggling women, Cisneros simultaneously develops the readers' sensitivity towards the lives of immigrants. The vignettes are quite short on average; the longest is 29 pages, while the shortest is fewer than five paragraphs. Despite such limited space, Cisneros experiments with daring poetic prose in her storytelling; for example, each story presents a new character with a distinct literary voice and style. Such writing has earned her the title of an accomplished Chicana poet, with the added credentials of her published books of poetry My Wicked Wicked Ways (1987) and Loose Woman (1994). ==Background== From early on, a bond ran throughout Cisneros's family as a result of being separated from their homeland and having to live as Mexican-Americans in Chicago. Cisneros was born into a family of seven children and was often singled out as she was the only daughter. Despite the abundance of sibling playmates, Cisneros always felt lonely as a child, thus prompting her to begin creating stories to vary her daily routine. After many years of writing, Cisneros used Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories to explore the failed relationships of the female characters via their reactions to the men in their lives. This feminine focus in the stories may reflect Cisneros's own views on relationships, as she does not appear to have a strong connection to any male figures in her life: \\"For her, men seem to be a utility that a woman turns on and off as required.\\" As the writing is from a Mexican-American immigrant's point of view, this feminism contends not only with the stereotype of gender, but of class and race as well. Cisneros \\"creates stories, not explanations or analyses or arguments\\", which describe her feminist views with \\"more provisional, personal, emotional, and intuitive forms of narrative\\". An example of her feminine focus is found in the title story \\"Woman Hollering Creek\\", which concentrates on a woman who is physically abused by her husband and feels drawn towards the nearby creek. She becomes depressed and sits beside the water with her new baby, contemplating how a woman could be driven crazy. Cisneros develops this tale, which has also been found slightly modified in Aztec, Greek, and Spanish cultures, from the legend of La Llorona (Spanish for \\"weeping woman\\"), a ghost story found in Mexico and Texas. In the myth, \\"a beautiful young woman named Maria falls in love and marries a handsome, rich boy, and their union is blessed with two sons and a daughter\\". Soon after, the man loses his affection for his wife. Maria, knowing that her husband no longer loves her, drowns their three children in the river and then herself. Upon reaching heaven, Maria is told that she cannot enter until she has found her children. She is sent back to Earth, where she wails sorrowfully for her children. According to legend, any child that happens upon her ghost is pulled into the river and drowned. The real Woman Hollering Creek, a body of water just off Interstate 10 in Texas, is the river which Cisneros mentions in her story. The protagonist in\\"Woman Hollering Creek\\" is rescued from her abusive husband by two strangers before she goes mad.‚Üí they ==Plot summaries== Cisneros's collection of stories is divided into three sections. The first section, which focuses on the innocence of the characters during childhood, is called \\"My Lucy Friend Who Smells Like Corn\\". The following section, called \\"One Holy Night\\", includes two short stories highlighting the troublesome adolescent years of its characters. The final section, called \\"There Was a Man, There Was a Woman\\", concentrates on characters during their tumultuous adulthood. Most of the stories in the collection are between one and fifteen pages in length; \\"Eyes of Zapata\\", the longest story, is 29 pages long, while \\"Salvador Late or Early\\" and \\"There Was a Man, There Was a Woman\\" each occupies a single page. The first and second plot of the story in this book shares the title, \\"My Lucy Friend Who Smells Like Corn\\", with its corresponding section and is a short narrative about an unnamed narrator and her best friend Lucy Anguiano, the \\"Texas girl who smells like corn\\". This vignette offers a snapshot into life just north of the United States-Mexico border for two girls who are presumably of Mexican descent. Lucy's home is portrayed as a low-income, Mexican-American family. Her mother is overworked and busy with many children while her father is rarely around. However, the story focuses on the freedom that the girls have when no one of authority is watching; for example, waving at strangers, jumping on mattresses, scratching mosquito bites, picking scabs, and somersaulting in dresses. The book's second segment, \\"One Holy Night\\", contains two short narratives focusing on adolescent females and the way their self-worth is affected by the tension of remaining loyal to Mexico while integrating into the American lifestyle. The title story \\"One Holy Night\\" introduces the reader to a young teenage girl, Ixchel, who, in her quest for true love, meets a 37-year-old man named Chato. He lies to her about belonging to ancient Mayan royalty, seduces her, and then abandons her, only to return in an attempt to kill her. In her youth and naivety, Ixchel desires to be romanced by someone with alleged Mexican roots, only to be disappointed by the reality of having fallen in love with a Mexican-American serial killer. The final section, entitled \\"There Was A Man, There Was A Woman\\", includes the title story \\"Women Hollering Creek\\", \\"Eyes of Zapata\\", and \\"Never Marry A Mexican\\", these being three out of the thirteen stories contained in this portion of the book. The title story, \\"Woman Hollering Creek\\", is about a Mexican woman, named Cle√≥filas, who marries Juan Pedro Mart√≠nez S√°nchez. After moving across the border to Segu√≠n, Texas, her hopes of having a happy marriage, like the characters she watches in the telenovelas, are dashed. Throughout their marriage, Juan Pedro is unfaithful, abusive and often leaves her in isolation. As her depression increases, so does her interest in the legendary figure, la llorona, and the creek named after her that runs behind her house. However, unlike this \\"weeping woman\\", who chooses death as a means to escape her unloving husband, Cle√≥filas, in a sense, chooses life. With the aid of two independent women, Felice and Graciela, she is able to leave her life of abuse and escape back to Mexico. Clemencia is the Chicana protagonist of the story \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\", who experiences rejection by her white lover. She takes revenge on this man by luring his na√Øve son into a lover‚Äôs role, and makes it known that in due time, this young man will inevitably pay for his father‚Äôs transgressions. \\"Eyes of Zapata\\" is a story that looks into the life of female protagonist, In√©s, who offers a reflection on her life in the context of her illegitimate relationship with Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. She struggles with being constantly abandoned by her lover, who is off \\"revolutionizing the country\\", and she describes her efforts to raise a family on her own despite hardships such as famine, disease, and poverty. In the end, she speaks about Zapata's assassination, revealing his failure to the revolution and In√©s makes it evident that essentially, Zapata, her unfaithful lover, has failed her and this protagonist is left clinging to dreams that can no longer exist. ==Characters== As this book is a collection of short stories and contains many different protagonists, the following is a selection of the book's main characters who most exemplify the qualities of the three sections of the book (youth, adolescence, and adulthood), or who have the most impact on Cisneros's use of female archetypes: Lucy Anguiano, the childhood friend of the narrator in \\"My Lucy Friend Who Smells Like Corn\\", is a dark skinned, Texas girl with eyes like knife slits. She is from a family with nine children, an exhausted mother and an absent father. She influences the narrator‚Äôs desire to share in the unadulterated and simple pleasures that childhood can bring. Ixchel, the self-named protagonist of \\"One Holy Night\\", is a thirteen-year-old girl who lives in Chicago with her uncle and grandmother who immigrated from Mexico. Employed by her uncle, every Saturday, this young teen sells produce from his pushcart. Ixchel being a foolish girl, ignorantly gives herself to one of her customers, a captivating, yet dangerous 37-year-old man. Over time, she realises that she has been seduced by a mass murderer but remains unable to reconcile herself with the fact that she is still in love with him. Chaq Uxmal Paloqu√≠n is another self-named character in the story \\"One Holy Night\\", nicknamed Boy Baby, but whose real name is Chato, which means fat-face. He was born on the streets, along with numerous brothers and sisters, in a Mexican town called Miseria. In this story he has grown up and is now a 37-year-old serial killer who seduces and then abandons the young, na√Øve protagonist by romanticizing her with a lie about being from an ancient line of Mayan kings. In√©s, the protagonist in \\"Eyes of Zapata\\", whose mother was raped and murdered for living an illegitimate lifestyle, is the mistress of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. In√©s struggles with being defined by the different roles she must play in her relationship with her lover. She is frustrated with the power of the male patriarchy that pushes her to be not only Zapata's lover, but also the mother to two of his children and his \\"political sister\\" in their shared fight for freedom. Cle√≥filas is the protagonist of the title story \\"Woman Hollering Creek\\", who recreates the image of la llorona. She is a traditional Mexican woman who na√Øvely allows her father to give her in marriage to a man who would become her abusive, unfaithful husband. However, through the hardships of her marriage, she is empowered, to fight for her rights. This is solidified when she meets Felice and Graciela, two independent, wage-earning women who act as new role models for Cle√≥filas. In the end, they help her escape this abusive lifestyle. Clemencia is the Chicana protagonist of \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\", whose life choices can be related to those of the historical figure La Malinche, an indigenous woman who befriended the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century. Both La Malinche and Clemencia were mistresses to men of a different ethnicity than their own, \\"doomed to exist within a racial and class-cultural wasteland, unanchored by a sense of ever belonging either to [their] ethnic or [their] natal homeland\\". Clemencia's final revenge in this vignette is not only a triumph in the memory of La Malinche, but also for the women who feel that their value depreciates if they do not have a husband. Rosario (Chayo) De Leon is a character who writes the last prayer note in \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\\"; a collection of letters in Cisneros's book, from Mexican-Americans to the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico who symbolizes female virginity. Chayo's letter provides a contrast between the Virgin of Guadalupe and La Malinche. She illustrates the difficulties of living as a modern Chicana with her beliefs on religion, race, and gender being constantly challenged. In attempts to free herself from being caught in between her modern day Chicana lifestyle and her Mexican heritage she begins to redefine who she is as a woman. In order to do this Chayo must accept that she is not quite malinche or virgin and she does this by acknowledging \\"the Virgin's pacifism and Malinche's sexuality through knowledge of her own Indian heritage\\". ==Themes== There are many themes found in this book; some that are recurring are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate as a result of relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as \\"in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity.\\" An example of this is Cle√≥filas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life was going to be a fairy tale. Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled \\"There Was A Man, There Was A Woman\\", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. The two female protagonists in \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\" and \\"Eyes of Zapata\\" use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, In√©s, in \\"Eyes of Zapata\\", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: \\"You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, you came back to me. You always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. You come back to me.\\" The protagonists are examined not only as individuals, but also by how they connect to people in their lives, such as in the conflicting love and failed relationships between man and woman; mother and daughter. For example, critic Elizabeth Brown-Guillory notes of the story \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\": \\"Cisneros portrays the mother as a destructive emotional force, alienating and condemning her daughter to repeating her own mother‚Äôs destructive powers.\\" This unsuccessful relationship between daughter and mother also affects the ways in which the women relate to men, as the mother is left at fault for any problematic situations with the daughter's male companions. For example, the daughter Clemencia remembers: \\"Never marry a Mexican, my ma said once and always. She said this because of my father. ... I‚Äôll [Clemencia] never marry. Not any man.\\" Cisneros also incorporates religion as she \\"pays tribute to the faith of simple people who express their petitions and gratitude.\\" This is especially apparent in her story \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\\", where people make petitions to the Virgen Mary, such as: \\"Madrecita de Dios, Thank you. Our child is born healthy! Rene y Janie Garza, Hondo, TX.\\" From the experience of growing up within two cultures Cisneros was able to combine both ethnicities, and in her stories she develops a major theme of hybridity between the American and Mexican cultures. She draws upon her life experience as she \\"depicts the situation of the Mexican- American woman: typically caught between two cultures, she resides in a cultural borderland. The topics of the stories range from the confusions of a bicultural and bilingual childhood to the struggles of a dark-skinned woman to recognize her own beauty in the land of Barbie dolls and blond beauty queens.\\" Because these issues are complex, Cisneros does not try to resolve all of them. Instead, she attempts to find neutral ground where the characters can try to meld their Mexican heritage with an American lifestyle, without feeling homesick for a country which, in some cases, the women have not even experienced. Although the book has recurring themes such as, (Chicana) feminism, Cisneros uses her power of observation so her stories and narrative are not overwhelmed by these themes. This feminism is portrayed as \\"women who establish identities for themselves, but also develop an independent, confident, even exultant sexuality\\". Not only this, but they learn to \\"love...[men] as they wish, and to establish sisterhood, mutually supportive relationships with other women.\\" Cisneros displays an abundance of poetic prose which uses frankness to captivate an audience. Reviewer Susan Wood suggests the reader sees that \\"Cisneros is a writer of power and eloquence and great lyrical beauty\\". Critic Deborah L. Madsen has said that \\"the narrative techniques of her fiction demonstrate daring technical innovations, especially in her bold experimentation with literary voice and her development of a hybrid form that weaves poetry into prose to create a dense and evocative linguistic texture of symbolism and imagery that is both technically and aesthetically accomplished\\". Madsen emphasizes Cisneros's creative ability to combine both prose and poetry. She also changes her narrative mode according to the demands of the story. For example, her narrative point of view almost continually changes, sometimes using first person, as we see in the story \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\\", and sometimes third person, as in \\"La Fabulosa: a Texas Operetta\\". Additionally, \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\" is characterized by the consistent use of interior monologue. Cisneros used this style in her previous novel The House on Mango Street where she mastered writing from the point of view of Esperanza; however, \\"moving on meant experimenting with many voices\\". She accomplished this in Woman Hollering Creek where she uses \\"a complex variety of voices and points of view.\\" Moore Campbell states that \\"[it] is this deluge of voices that Ms. Cisneros so faithfully taps in her work.\\" Cisneros intertwines the American and Mexican cultures linguistically, as \\"[her] stories are full of Spanish words and phrases. She clearly loves her life in two worlds, and as a writer is grateful to have 'twice as many words to pick from ... two ways of looking at the world.' A sometime poet, Cisneros uses those words so precisely that many of her images stick in a reader's mind. Of two people kissing, for instance, she writes: 'It looked as if their bodies were ironing each other's clothes.' \\" ==Reception== Cisneros has been honored with several awards as a result of Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, including the PEN Center West Award for best fiction, the Lannan Foundation Literary Award, the Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award, and, in 1993, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. K. Prescott states that once the book was published, Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories was well-received because women of many cultures could relate to the stories: \\"Cisneros surveys woman's condition‚Äîa condition that is both precisely Latina and general to women everywhere. Her characters include preadolescent girls, disappointed brides, religious women, consoling partners and deeply cynical women who enjoy devouring men. They are without exception strong girls, strong women.\\" Marcia Tager comments again on the characters, saying that Cisneros \\"writes with humour and love about people she knows intimately\\". For critic Ilan Stavans, the stories are not just words, but \\"a mosaic of voices of Mexican-Americans who joke, love, hate and comment on fame and sexuality... They are verbal photographs, memorabilia, reminiscences of growing up in a Hispanic milieu.\\" The American Library Journal and The New York Times honoured Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories as a noteworthy book of the year. The New York Times reviewer Bebe Moore Campbell wrote in 1991 that \\"[these] stories about women struggling to take control of their lives traverse geographical, historical and emotional borders and invite us into the souls of characters as unforgettable as the first kiss\\". Apart from much praise, one criticism is that Cisneros stereotypes Hispanic men and women in her stories. Stavans argues that the males \\"are always abusive, alcoholic and egotistical\\", while the women are \\"na√Øve [and] doll-like\\". Susan Wood comments on the publication of Woman Hollering Creek by Random House: \\"Despite the growing number and influence of Latinos in the USA, the only identifiably Latin's names‚Äìwith a few exceptions like Oscar Hijuelos‚Äìon books published by major houses are those translations of Latin American novels.\\" ==NotesReferences== * .

Mks I - IVMk I = Mark 1, Mk II = Mark 2, Mk III = Mark 3, Mk IV = Mk 4. Britain used Roman numerals to denote marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. Hence this article covers the first four models of British 13.5 inch guns were all of 30 calibres length and of similar construction and performance. ==United Kingdom service== Royal Navy service Aft barbette mounting on battleship in drydock at Chatham Dockyard in the 1890s The gun was designed to match the new large guns of the French battleships. Development and manufacture occurred far slower than intended. The first ships armed with the 13.5 in gun were four of the s: , , and , which were laid down in 1882-83 and completed in 1888-89.Parkes, British Battleships, p317. The Howe and the Rodney were laid down to the same dimensions as the preceding , which was designed for 12 in 45 ton guns. The increase in weight of the 13.5 in guns, their mountings and ammunition increased draught from to , and increased displacement by . The Anson and Camperdown were laid down later, to greater dimensions. All four ships carried their 13.5 in guns in twin barbettes on the centreline at each end of the superstructure. The guns also equipped the subsequent laid down in 1886 and s laid down in 1889. Coast defence service A single Mk III gun was mounted as a disappearing gun for coast defence at Penlee Battery, Plymouth.Victorian Forts and Artillery ==Italian service== Barbette mounting on Re Umberto Guns were also sold to Italy to arm the s , , and , laid down in 1884 and finally commissioned in 1893 and 1895. ==Construction== The gun was made up of the following parts: *A tube, *Breech-piece, *B hoop, *B tube, *1- and 2-C hoops, *C tube, *1- and 2D hoops, and *Jacket. Construction was as follows: #The breech-piece, B hoop and B tube were shrunk over the A tube, extending to the muzzle. #The 1-C hoop was shrunk over the breech-piece. The 1-C hoop and the breech-piece were connected longitudinally by a screwed steel bush at the breech end. The bush was prepared for receiving the breech screw. #The C tube and 2-C hoop were shrunk over the B hoop and B tube. #The 1-D hoop was shrunk round the 1-C hoop and part of the C tube. This was secured at the breech end by a screwed steel ring. #The 2-D hoop was shrunk over the C tube immediately in front of the 1 D hoop. #The jacket was shrunk round the 1-D hoop at the breech. #Thrust collars were formed on the outside of the 1-D hoop and were used to secure the gun to the gun-mounting (the gun did not have trunnions). The length of the bore was (30 calibres), of which the length of rifling was . The rifling used the increasing twist system; there were 54 grooves, with a twist of 1 in 120 at the breech-end rising to 1 in 30 at from the muzzle; the twist then remained a uniform 1 in 30. The chamber length was , and the volume of the chamber was . The gun had a hydraulically-operated interrupted-screw breech-block. The breech-block was completely detached from the gun during loading (because there was no carrier). The guns were designed and manufactured by Woolwich Arsenal.Parkes, British Battleships, p318. There were significant delays in the manufacture of the guns in the 1880s, which inordinately delayed the completion of the first four battleships equipped with them. The cause of the delays was \\"the faulty principle of placing liners in the bores which cracked during proof and it took a long time to repair these and make the guns efficient.\\"Parkes, British Battleships, p319. ==Operating characteristics== The gun fired a projectile using brown powder (SBC) propellant. This gave the projectile a muzzle velocity of , which would penetrate wrought iron at .'Garbutt, Naval Gunnery, p120 When smokeless propellant was introduced, the gun had a cordite-44 charge, giving the 1,250 lb projectile a muzzle velocity of . The calibre radius head (crh) of the projectiles was nominally two. In the Admiral and Trafalgar classes the maximum elevation was 13 degrees. In the Royal Sovereign class and the Hood the maximum elevation was 13.5 degrees. At 13.5 degrees elevation, the maximum range with brown powder was , whilst with cordite it was .British Naval Guns 1880-1945, No 2, by NJM Campbell, in Warship Volume V p96. The projectiles used a copper driving band to engage the rifling. Once a gun had fired about 100-110 rounds with full (brown powder) charges, the rifling became worn near the breech, such that it was necessary to augment the width of the driving bands. Ships were therefore issued with \\"augmenting strips\\", which were long strips of copper that were hammered partially into the recessed ring around the projectile (cannelure) that held the driving band. Once guns were too worn for augmenting strips to help, the guns were sent back to the factory to be relined.'Garbutt, Naval Gunnery, p124 Wear was lower when firing reduced charges. Under favourable circumstances, the 13.5 in guns on the Anson could fire once every two minutes.'Garbutt, Naval Gunnery, p123 ==See also== * List of naval guns Weapons of comparable role, performance and era * 340mm/28 Mod√®le 1881 gun French equivalent ==NotesReferencesBibliography== * Text Book of Gunnery, 1902.

It lived during late Oligocene in Europe. It is believed that Dinailurictis is probably a synonym of Quercylurus major, and Quercylurus is a synonym of Nimravus intermedius major. So it means that Dinailurictis and Quercylurus may have looked like Nimravus, but all species of Nimravus were no larger than a large lynx and Quercylurus was about 1 m high and its weight was 300 kg, also Quercylurus major is older than Dinailurictis. This shows that Quercylurus might be ancestral to Dinailurictis. If Dinailurictis was a synonym of Quercylurus, it might have a sleek body like caracal but its back was longer and feet of this nimravid probably were more dog-like than cat-like with partially retractable claws. Dinailurictis and Quercylurus probably hunted small mammals and birds. Its technique of hunting was ambushing them like modern cats rather than chasing them down. There is only one known species of this rare nimravid - Dinailurictis bonali. ==References== Category:Nimravidae Category:Oligocene feliforms Category:Oligocene mammals of Europe Category:Paleogene France Category:Fossils of France Category:Quercy Phosphorites Formation Category:Oligocene mammals of North America ","title":"Dinailurictis"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:T}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},L={class:"card-container"};function W(s,a,t,c,u,n){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",L,[(i(!0),o(h,null,y(n.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(i(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",W]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/23.md","filePath":"quotes/23.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/23.md"},K=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,t)=>(i(),o("div",null,[C(R)]))}});export{N as __pageData,K as default};
