It was designed by Bjarne Mastenbroek and Winy Maas of MVRDV in 1997.Carles Broto, New Housing Concepts,Leading International Publishing Group, 2002 The Koek Family bought a large piece of land that overlooked a beautiful park, but soon found out that they could not afford to build a house to satisfy such a great piece of land.Colin Davies, Key Houses of the Twentieth Century: Plans, Sections, and Elevations [17 October 2006] They realized that with the joint income of two families, the house could reach its true potential, so the Koek family joined with the Wesseling family. Bjarne Mastenbroek was given the task of fitting the two families into one structure, and divide views close to equally, while the original buyers would get two thirds of the space and the new buyers would get one third of the space.Sishe Chin, Utrecht Double House ARCH 200 Assignment, Spring 2006 The project size ended up being . == Architecture == The ownership of the house had to be split between the two families, but the families couldn‚Äôt decide who would get better views, better entrances and so on. So Bjarne Mastenbroek and Winy Maas developed an interlocking system for the architecture to make it feel like they had a lot of space. The architecture pushes and pulls at each floor, taking space away at one point, then regaining it the next floor. The parting wall slithers through the two spaces in a zig zag pattern. A straight wall could not be used because it would create very narrow spaces, that would not give the views that the beautiful park could provide.Colin Davies, Key Houses of the Twentieth Century: Plans, Sections, and Elevations [17 October 2006] Theoretically the parting wall was a great idea, though caused major building problems. The two architects worked through this problem though, even without any interior columns. They used steel trusses and props, that they hid in the internal and exterior walls. Even with the structural problems they managed to put huge glass windows for the views. The outside panelling of just plywood has been debated on the reason that material was chosen. Some say that it was used to emphasize the abstract box of the building, and to reject any tectonic expression of structure or construction, and then some say that it was simply because of financial issues.Colin Davies, Key Houses of the Twentieth Century: Plans, Sections, and Elevations [17 October 2006]Sishe Chin, Utrecht Double House ARCH 200 Assignment, Spring 2006 The two families spaces end up being very linear. with one staircase each.

Both sides of the house had to be covered in glass to reach the sites potential. The park has a lake and a lot of green, and is a large part of the community.

One of the commissioners, Andy Wells, a councillor for St. John's City Council, made comments to the press describing the executive benefits package as \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"unconscionable\\" before the hearings began. He gave a series of interviews discussing his opposition to further pay and pension increases. The Newfoundland Telephone Co. objected to the participation of Wells, claiming that his statements created a reasonable apprehension of bias. However, the Board found that they could not remove one of its own members, and rejected their submissions. Following the proceedings, Wells continued to speak to the press, making clear his opposition to the executive salaries in question. On August 3, 1989, the Board issued its decision (3-2 in which Wells was part of the majority), which disapproved of an \\"enhanced pension plan\\", ordered a refund to customers for inappropriate executive expenses, but did not make any order with respect to individual executive salaries. Newfoundland Telephone Co. appealed the order to the Newfoundland Court of Appeal, claiming that the Board's orders were void because Wells' statements to the press showed a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Court of Appeal decided in favour of the Board, but the decision was further appealed to the Supreme Court. ==Opinion of the Court== The unanimous Court held that Wells' statements during and after the hearings showed a reasonable apprehension of bias, rendering the decision void. In reaching this decision, the Court noted that the duty of fairness applied to all administrative bodies, but \\"the extent of that duty will depend upon the nature and the function of the particular tribunal.\\"[1992] 1 SCR 623 at para 22. Cory J, writing for the court, described how the duty of fairness applied to the spectrum of administrative bodies. > Those that are primarily adjudicative in their functions will be expected to > comply with the standard applicable to courts: there must be no reasonable > apprehension of bias with regard to their decision. At the other end of the > scale are boards with popularly elected members where the standard will be > much more lenient. In such circumstances, a reasonable apprehension of bias > occurs if a board member pre‚Äëjudges the matter to such an extent that any > representations to the contrary would be futile. Administrative boards that > deal with matters of policy will be closely comparable to the boards > composed of elected members. For those boards, a strict application of a > reasonable apprehension of bias as a test might undermine the very role > which has been entrusted to them by the legislature.Ibid at para 27. The Public Utilities Board in question was found to be more legislative in nature, dealing primarily with policy issues. Thus, it applied an \\"open mind\\" test which required the party alleging bias to \\"establish that there is a prejudgment of the matter ... to the extent that any representations at variance with the view ... would be futile.\\"Ibid at para 25 With respect to Wells' comments before the hearings began, the court found that he did not exhibit a closed mind.Ibid at para 35 On the other hand, a higher standard was necessary once the hearings began.Ibid at para 36. They found that Wells' statements to the press during the hearings \\"taken together, give a clear indication that not only was there a reasonable apprehension of bias but that Mr. Wells had demonstrated that he had a closed mind on the subject.\\"Ibid at para 38. As a consequence of the Court's findings of bias, the orders made by the Board were declared void. The Court definitively stated that once there was a finding of bias, the decision made by the administrative body could not stand: > A decision of a tribunal which denied the parties a fair hearing cannot be > simply voidable and rendered valid as a result of the subsequent decision of > the tribunal. The damage created by apprehension of bias cannot be remedied. > The hearing, and any subsequent order resulting from it, must be void.Ibid > at para 40. ==References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian administrative case law Category:1992 in Canadian case law Category:Bell Aliant ","title":"Newfoundland Telephone Co v Newfoundland (Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities)"},{"id":"35270677","text":"Muria is a Dravidian language spoken in India.

Starting at Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Company, St. John rose through the ranks to become one of the major comedy stars of the 1920s, though less than half of his starring roles still survive today. With the advent of sound drastically changing and curtailing the two-reel comedy format, St. John diversified, creating a second career for himself as a comic sidekick in Western films and ultimately developing the character of \\"Fuzzy Q. Jones\\", for which he is best known in posterity. == Starring St. John == St. John's first starring roles were made at Keystone, but most of these were made at the very end of the history of the company, just as Mack Sennett was abandoning the \\"Keystone\\" moniker in order to extricate himself from the Triangle Film Corporation partnership. St. John got a second chance at solo stardom starting in 1919 with Paramount Pictures and the early Warner Bros. studio, and this led to extended series of 2-reel comedies for Fox Film Corporation and Educational Pictures. Al St. John starred in more than 70 2-reel comedies through 1932. This is the most important part of his personal legacy, but it remains the least accessible part of his activity. Changes to this list are inevitable, and are welcomed. {  - ! Title !! Release Date !! Director !! Support Cast !! Silent/Sound !! Studio !! Distributor !! Status !!

Jones appearances == \\"Fuzzy Q. Jones\\" was developed when Al St. John filled in for actor Fuzzy Knight on a film Knight was unable to make. St. John made more than 80 western films in this character, which proved indispensable to the PRC studio and so popular that \\"Fuzzy Settles Down\\" (1944) remains the only American B-Western that is titled after the sidekick. In post-war Germany, where Fuzzy was especially popular, he was always billed in the title of his pictures, despite the presence of the hero. It was as Fuzzy‚Äîwhom Al came to regard as a separate person, apart from himself‚Äîthat St. John finished out his long film career. These films had, in many cases, multiple theatrical distributors, and most of the PRCs were re-released in the 1950s by Madison Pictures, though in some instances in cut down versions. In cases where a television vendor is the more likely medium through which one may see a given title, the vendor is listed in the distribution field is given rather than the original theatrical distributor. A listing for a home video does not automatically mean that the title is still available for viewing. All of these films were made in sound, and are extant. {  - ! Title !! Release Date !!

Arbuckle first brought St. John to the Keystone set in 1913; over the years to follow, Arbuckle routinely employed St. John in playing rubes, rivals and other parts in support of his popular \\"Fatty\\" character. When Arbuckle left Keystone in early 1917 to form the Comique Comedy unit at Paramount, he and St. John were joined by stage comedian Buster Keaton, and the three created a singular cycle of silent comedies that exploited their matched acrobatic abilities and hard-driving capabilities in slapstick. This section represents onscreen appearances in films by St. John with either Arbuckle, Keaton or both, and it remains the most accessible area of Al St. John's silent comedy work.

After Keystone, St. John appeared in support of other comics in 2-reelers up to the end of the silent era. Appearances in films with Roscoe Arbuckle are included in the list above. This list may be incomplete, as the full extent of St. John's appearances of this kind is not known, owing to so many lost films that may serve as possible candidates. For Keystones, the principal actor is included, though in many cases it is unclear who within the film that may be. Owing to the ensemble nature of many early Keystones, there are films which essentially do not have a central comedian as the fixture, and outside of Charlie Chaplin, survival rates on Keystones are less than what would be ideal. Unconfirmed appearances are not included in this list.Although previously listed here, Al St. John does not appear in the following Keystones, according to Brent Walker in Mack Sennett's Fun Factory (McFarland, Jefferson NC 2013): Soldiers of Misfortune (1914), He Loved the Ladies (1914). {  - !

While his Fuzzy Q. Jones roles dominate St. John's feature output, he did appear in a number of features in other parts, mostly in Westerns. Some of these, particularly his serio-comic turn as \\"Uncle Billy\\" in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1937), demonstrate a greater range of acting ability than the average Fuzzy Q. Jones role might suggest. Several parts listed here, however, are the tiniest of tiny bit roles. {  - ! Title !! Release Year !! Director !! Star(s) !! Silent/Sound !! Studio !! Distributor !!

The firm's projects include many built and proposed works in the United States and South Korea. == Biography == Kyu Sung Woo was born in Seoul, South Korea. After receiving a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, he went to the United States in 1967. He then studied at Columbia University, where he received a Master of Architecture (1968) and Harvard University, where he received a Master of Architecture in Urban Design (1970). He founded Kyu Sung Woo Architects, Inc. in 1990 after working in various design and consulting positions around the US.Kyu Sung Woo and Oscar Riera Ojeda, Whanki Museum (Gloucester, MA: Rockport, 1999) 12. In 2008, Woo received the South Korea's Ho-Am Prize in the Arts. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. == Architectural style == The frequent use of simplified rectilinear forms and volumes in Woo's works tie him to the modernist movement. Additionally, several aspects of his style are often drawn from his cultural experience living in both South Korea and The United States.Sara Lin, \\"Creating New Roots.\\" Editorial. The Wall Street Journal. 30 Jan. 2009. 22 Mar. 2012. . Hong-bin Kang, a fellow South Korean architect, remarked that, \\"It is meaningless to ask if Woo is a 'Korean' architect or an 'American' architect: for he is neither, and at the same time, both‚Ä¶ He does not try to sell 'oriental' qualities to the American architectural community, nor does he attempt to introduce the latest in Western architecture to Koreans.\\"Woo and Ojeda, 13 Evidence of these two cultural influences can be seen in Woo's Putnam Mountain House, which features pitched New England-style roofs along with large sliding glass doors, similar to the screen doors that would lead to outdoor courtyards in traditional Korean homes.Lin, \\"Creating New Roots\\". Furthermore, Woo often articulates his design philosophy in terms of how the necessities of a building's site should shape its appearance and organization. In discussing the Whanki Museum, Woo stated, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I tried to consider how to conform the museum‚Äôs existence as a public building to the scale of its neighborhood, its topography, and its natural environment.‚ÄùWoo and Ojeda, 6. == Projects == Woo's works include varying scales of buildings, from small homes to mass residential complexes and institutional buildings.  Olympic Village Housing ‚Äì Seoul  While working at Woo & Williams (later to become Kyu Sung Woo Architects, Inc.), Woo entered an international competition in 1985 to design a housing village for the athletes and reporters of the 24th Olympic Games in Seoul. Woo's design was selected and completed in 1988. The complex, which is located south of the city, includes 5,540 housing units and supporting facilities. It is arranged in a fan shape, with residential units radiating from a U-shaped galleria and public plaza. The buildings conform to a bowl-shaped landscape, with the residential towers increasing in height as they move outwards from the central plaza.Hasan-Uddin Khan, Contemporary Asian Architects (K√∂ln: Taschen, 1995) 155. Throughout the course of the Games, 13,000 athletes and 7,000 journalists were housed in the complex.Kyu Sung Woo Architects. Kyu Sung Woo Architects, Inc. 29 Feb. 2012. . Following the Olympic Games, the complex was repurposed into a permanent urban community.Khan, 155. This community includes a subway station, three schools, and religious, cultural, recreational, and retail facilities.  Whanki Museum  The Whanki Museum is a museum/exhibition complex located in the Buam Dong Valley in Seoul. The building was constructed in 1992 in commemoration of the contemporary Korean painter, Kim Whanki.Woo and Ojeda, 12. The, complex occupies two blocks, one of which houses the works of Kim Whanki, while the other contains a temporary art exhibition space, a cafeteria, and a shop. The compound is arranged to follow the east-west axis of the valley.Khan, 156. The central hall of the museum building serves as the unifying space in Woo's design.Woo and Ojeda, 16. The 8 meter-tall cube-shaped space is partially underground and divided in order to create display space for paintings on the bottom walls. The top walls are carved away into columns, revealing a stairwell that encompasses the space. The hall is lit directly using artificial light and a central skylight and indirectly through the adjacent mezzanine.Khan, 157. In designing the Museum, Woo described his desired connection between Kim's art and his own architecture, \\"In exhibition spaces, the architectural experience should be subordinate to that of the art. Here and elsewhere, however, architecture does not have to play a passive role. The process of absorbing art is a collective and continuous experience that occurs throughout a museum, an intense activity that needs intervals of rest. Occasional connections with nature and the context, activated by the architecture of a museum, can enhance one‚Äôs experience of a work of art and make one‚Äôs appreciation of both more relevant and rich.\\"Woo and Ojeda, 23.  10 Akron Street  10 Akron Street is a LEED Gold certified residence hall on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The building is situated on the banks of the Charles River and at the foot of a 22-story residential tower, Peabody Terrace, designed by Josep Lluis Sert (an architect whom Woo had studied under at Harvard).Jane F. Kolleeny, \\"10 Akron Street Cambridge, Massachusetts\\", Architectural Record 198.11 (2010): 128. The residence hall is a 115,000-square-foot building that is U-shaped in plan. It was constructed in 2008 around a courtyard garden designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh. Due to the building's highly public location at the entrance of campus, Woo aimed to reconcile the scale and massing of the building with those of the surrounding communities and views.Kolleeny, 127. On the design of 10 Akron Street, Woo remarked, \\"I wanted this building to relate to and complement Peabody Terrace both in massing and scale. These two projects, however, are designed 50 years apart and are reflections of their own time. Innovation was the essence of Peabody Terrace for housing typology, construction, technology, and aesthetics; while Akron housing was an attempt to retain tradition and innovation within the given changing conditions of the city and campus.\\"Kolleeny, 128. == Other notable projects == * Asian Culture Complex ‚Äì Gwangju, South Korea * Village Residence Halls ‚Äì Brandeis University * Heller School ‚Äì Brandeis University * Putney Mountain House ‚Äì Putney, Vermont * Stone Cloud ‚Äì Seoul * Nerman Museum for Contemporary Art ‚Äì Overland Park, Kansas * Woo Residence ‚Äì Cambridge, Massachusetts * Residence Hall ‚Äì Massachusetts College of Art, Boston * International Village ‚Äì Northeastern University, Boston * Behrakis Health Sciences Center ‚Äì Northeastern University * Arts of Korea Gallery ‚Äì Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Student Housing ‚Äì Bennington College, Vermont * Keum Jung Sports Park ‚Äì Busan, South Korea * Observatory Commons ‚Äì Cambridge, Massachusetts ==References==  Additional references  *\\"Architecture.\\" Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art.

The FAB was originally designed as an Export Processing Zone. Its existing infrastructures include 11 Standard Factory Buildings (SFB) with three stories each, and a total working area of . per SFB. It is currently home to over 50 locators engaged in manufacturing products for export ranging from tennis balls to yachts. AFAB also has two locators using their facilities for warehousing, one locator engaged in animal feeds processing and an enterprise currently constructing a clean coal power plant. These enterprises employ a total of 13,443 workers. The objective of the AFAB is to revive the area and expand the Freeport. To accomplish these objectives, the Freeport seeks to attract more locators in the manufacturing, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), electronics industries and green industries, among others. It is also seeking investors to boost its tourism capabilities by refurbishing its existing recreational facilities. The AFAB is also targeting new investors to build hotels, entertainment establishments, duty-free shops, resorts, team- building facilities, and sports facilities, among others, to encourage the influx of local and foreign tourists. It also hopes to attract a medical center to the Freeport with a view towards medical tourism. Finally, it aims to encourage universities and colleges to locate in the area, to create and sustain a talent pool that can service the human resource needs of the locators. ==History== In 1972, the Bataan Export Processing Zone (BEPZ) became the first official economic zone in the Philippines through Republic Act 5490 of 1969. The BEPZ was one of the most progressive communities in Luzon during its first decade of operation. The area attracted over one hundred multinational locators. Despite the economic activity and growth in the area brought about by the development of the Subic and Clark freeports in the 1990s, the development in the BEZ stagnated and then declined rapidly. To put a halt to the decline of the BEZ and allow the zone to fulfill its original mandate to become a catalyst for progress and development in the region as well as create employment and livelihood opportunities for the people, House Representative Albert S. Garcia (Congressman, Second District of Bataan) authored a bill for the conversion of then BEZ into a freeport. Congress thereafter passed the Freeport Area of Bataan Act (RA 9728), which was enacted into law on October 23, 2009. This Act converted the BEZ into the FAB, a special economic zone and Freeport with a dedicated governing authority, the Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan (AFAB). Eight months after the enactment of RA 9728 into law, AFAB officially started its operations on June 30, 2010 which marked the turnover of the zone's operations and management from Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) to AFAB. ==Administration== The Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan (AFAB) is headed by an Administrator who sits as Chairman of the 9-member AFAB Board of Directors. Each Board member represents a sector that is vital to the growth and development of the FAB. All members, including the Chairman, are appointed by the President of the Philippines. The AFAB may grant to its FAB enterprises incentives under the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 or the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987. The AFAB has the power to operate on its own, or to license, tourism-related enterprises, including games, gambling casinos, horse-racing and other recreational and sports facilities, subject to the approval and supervision of PAGCOR. == See also == * Albert S.

She was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1923 to 1930 and from 1933 to 1942, representing District 50 and Otter Tail County. Kempfer was one of the four women first elected to the Minnesota legislature in 1922 after women's suffrage. Born on a ship in the North Sea, Kempfer was adopted by a Norwegian family that immigrated to the United States in 1885. Her family settled in Minnesota and squatted a piece of railroad land where she grew up in poverty. She became a teacher at a small rural schoolhouse. As a legislator, she championed the rights of children and fought for the conservation of natural resources. She introduced legislation to protect the Showy Lady's slipper, Minnesota's state flower. ==Biography== Early life, education and career Johannah Josephine Jensen in Stavanger, Norway (circa 1883) Johannah Josephine was born on December 22, 1880 in the North Sea on a ship sailing under a British flag. Her father was a sailor and her mother an unwed stewardess. Her mother left her in Stavanger, Norway, where she was taken to an orphanage. Ole and Martha Jensen, a shipbuilder and his wife who had recently lost their only child, adopted Johannah in March 1881. The Jensens immigrated to Adams, Minnesota in 1885 where they stayed with relatives. In 1889, the Jensens moved to Otter Tail County and, being very poor, squatted a piece of property that belonged to the railroad. When Johannah Josephine was 12, she took the train to Fergus Falls to find work. She was taken in by the family of a milkman. She attended both Fergus Falls High School and Park Region Luther College in Fergus Falls. A teacher shortened her name to Hannah. At 17, she tested for her teaching certificate and became a teacher in Friberg Township. She began serving hot lunches there and her school became known as \\"Hot Soup School\\". She taught from 1898 to 1908 and paid off her debts, buying the land her family had been living on. She also worked as a correspondent for the Fergus Falls newspaper Wheelock's Weekly. She married Charles Taylor Kempfer, a farmer, on May 23, 1903 and moved to his parents' farm. They never had children of their own, but were foster parents for eleven children that had been orphaned. Kempfer was active in her community, helping to form a farm improvement club and organizing church socials and quilting bees. When a tornado tore through Fergus Falls, she helped organize a relief effort. Minnesota House of Representatives Following the passage of the women's suffrage amendment in 1920, Kempfer was encouraged by her friends and neighbors to run for the Minnesota legislature. In 1922, Kempfer filed for the office of Representative of the 50th Legislative District of the State of Minnesota. She ran as an independent, even refusing an endorsement from the Nonpartisan League. She campaigned throughout the county, traveling in a Ford Model T. In November she was elected as one Minnesota's first four woman legislators alongside Mabeth Hurd Paige, Sue Metzger Dickey Hough and Myrtle Cain. She became friends with Paige, who assisted her financially. She was the first woman elected to the Legislature from rural Minnesota, hailing from Erhard. Otter Tail County returned her to the House nine times, from 1923 to 1930 and from 1933 to 1942. During legislative sessions, she lived in St. Paul in a shared apartment on lower Summit Avenue. She was the first woman to serve as the honorary speaker in the Minnesota House of Representatives after being so appointed on January 28, 1925. Kempfer supported numerous conservation measures throughout her political career. She and Mabeth Hurd Paige introduced legislation in 1925 that protected the Showy Lady's slipper, Minnesota's state flower. She chaired the Committee on Game and Fish and in 1927 supported a measure that introduced Minnesota's first fishing license fee. Kempfer was criticized for her support of the unpopular measure. While she was re-elected in 1928, she lost her seat in 1930. Her niece later attributed the loss to the fishing license law. She also spearheaded a drive to prohibit the use of steel traps on publicly owned lands. During her time in the legislature, Kempfer advocated for the welfare of children. In 1923, she joined her fellow women legislators and introduced a bill extending rights to children born out of wedlock. In a speech on the floor of the House, she remarked \\"A child should not be punished for what is no fault of his own. I want to do all I can to improve the lot of these poor children because I am one of them. I am an illegitimate child.\\" In 1930, Kempfer was invited to Washington D.C. for the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection where she met President Herbert Hoover and First Lady Lou Henry Hoover. Following the repeal of Prohibition, she supported local option laws and the issue came up repeatedly in her subsequent campaigns. Kempfer fell and fractured her hip on July 14, 1943 at her home in Erhard. She died at the Fergus Falls hospital on September 27, 1943 due to complications from a tumor which was too close to her aorta to be removed via operation. She is interred at Tonseth Lutheran Church Cemetery in Friberg Township. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Hannah Kempfer at Minnesota Legislators Past & Present *Portraits of State Representative Hannah Kempfer, Hennepin County Library ‚Äì Minneapolis Photo Collection *Hannah Kempfer at Minnesota Historical Society Category:1880 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Schoolteachers from Minnesota Category:Deaths from cancer in Minnesota Category:Minnesota Independents Category:Members of the Minnesota House of Representatives Category:Norwegian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Fergus Falls, Minnesota Category:People from Otter Tail County, Minnesota Category:Women state legislators in Minnesota Category:20th- century American politicians Category:20th-century American women politicians Category:People from Mower County, Minnesota Category:20th-century American educators Category:Norwegian adoptees ","title":"Hannah Kempfer"},{"id":"35270963","text":"Unitel S.A. is a private Angolan mobile phone company which was established on 8 March 2001Unitel, Angolas biggest cellphone operator, ipad.africa.com, retrieved 9 August 2012 as a joint-stock company.

In 1922, he came to North China with his missionary parents, Harold Shepard () and Grace Waters Matthews, who were under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He acquired Mandarin Chinese as his first language and spent his childhood in Beijing, Dezhou of Shandong Province, Tianjin, and Fenzhou of Shanxi Province. Matthews attended North China American School and in 1937 he returned to the United States to receive higher education. Later he graduated from Grinnell College, in Grinnell, Iowa, and Chicago Theological Seminary. As a young man, he served in the Navy and Naval Reserve as a chaplain. On June 15, 1944, he married Derrith Jane Lovell, his college classmate, and in 1946 their first child was born. Matthews returned to China in 1947 along with his wife and baby daughter. He was assigned to Fuzhou to serve in the Mid-Fukien Synod of the Church of Christ in China (). At first he worked in Changle, where his job was to help strengthen the churches in that area. In 1948, he moved to the West Gate of Fuzhou city to teach agricultural engineering in Union High School. In 1949 he again moved to the American Board mission compound near the South Gate, where he worked as the liaison with the Congregational Church in America with the title Corresponding Secretary. During that time his second daughter was born at Union Hospital, Foochow. Situations became difficult when Fuzhou was taken over by the Communist regime in August 1949. However, Matthews chose to stay to continue the mission work, but it wasn't long before he realized that the presence of the foreign missionaries had been counter-productive. In December, 1950, he and Derrith and their two daughters had to leave China. After a one-year study in Union Theological Seminary, New York, Matthews was again sent to Japan in 1952 to do a variety of work including teaching and administration in the United Church of Christ in Japan. His third child was born there. During the long period in Japan he was a member of the League of Women Voters, a Rotarian Emeritus, and member of Crystal Beach Community Church, as well as serving on many prestigious boards in Japan.

In 1996 Matthews married again to Sallie Parks, a lady he met in Japan in 1986, who was then also working there. In 2007, Matthews published his autobiography My Three Worlds (), where he tells his inspiring stories in China, America, and Japan.

She discovers that Wallace is a lenient father, and his daughter, Madeline (Maurine Powers) frequents less-than- reputable nightclubs, and is also the pawn of Mr. Reynolds (Coit Albertson), who is dating her for business reasons. Anna discovers Madeline alone in Anna's apartment and uses this to get back at Wallace. She eventually sends Madeline home, and the two fathers reconcile with their daughters. ==Cast== *Anna Q.

Dou Gouwutu (È¨¨Á©ÄÊñºËèü; fl. 7th century BC), a grandson of the Chu ruler Ruo'ao, was said to have been abandoned as an infant and nursed by a tigress.

Its meaning depends on the hanja used to write it. ==Family name== Overview The family name Ban is written with either of two hanja, indicating different lineages. The 2000 South Korean census found a total of 26,171 people and 8,143 households with these family names. In a study by the National Institute of the Korean Language based on 2007 application data for South Korean passports, it was found that 93.8% of people with this family name spelled it in Latin letters as Ban in their passports, while 4% spelled it Van. Rarer alternative spellings (the remaining 2.2%) included Bahn. Less common (Áè≠) Nanul Ban () is the less common of the two Ban family names. This character was originally used to write the Chinese family name pronounced BƒÅn in Mandarin. None of the surviving records clarify when the family name was adopted in Korea or whether the various clans using this character as their surname have a common ancestor. The 2000 South Korean census found 2,955 people with this family name, and 919 households. The surviving bon-gwan (origin of a clan lineage, not necessarily the actual residence of the clan members) at that time included: #Gwangju: 1,492 people and 451 households. #Kaesong (Gaeseong): 685 people and 215 households. Between the 1985 Census and the 2000 Census, it was the only major Ban (Áè≠) clan for which the number of members shrank (from 1,028 people), while all the other major Ban clans saw their population multiply by anywhere from six to eighty times. One author suggests that some members of the Kaesong Ban clan had re-identified as belonging to other bon-gwan in the 2000 Census. It is the only surviving Ban clan in South Korea whose bon-gwan is located in what is now North Korean territory. #Pyeonghae: 401 people and 133 households. It was one of the two Ban clans which showed massive increases in population numbers between the 1985 and 2000 censuses: in the former, it was recorded as having just nine members. #Goseong: 345 people and 113 households. It had just four members in the 1985 census. #Other or unknown bon-gwan: 32 people and 7 households. More common (ÊΩò) Tteumul Ban () is the more common of the two Ban family names. This character was originally used to write the Chinese family name pronounced PƒÅn in Mandarin. The 2000 South Korean census found 23,216 people with this family name, and 7,224 households. The surviving bon- gwan at that time included: #Geoje (see Geoje Ban clan): 10,063 people and 3,152 households. They claim descent from Ban Bu (; Pinyin: ) of China, who is said to have come to Korea when China was ruled by the Southern Song Dynasty. #Gwangju: 6,660 people and 2,031 households. They are a branch of the Geoje Ban clan. They claim descent from Ban Chung (), a sixth-generation descendant of Ban Bu who served under Taejo of Joseon. #Giseong: 3,194 people and 1,039 households. They are another branch of the Geoje Ban clan; Giseong was an old placename on Geoje Island. A relatively large concentration had lived in a clan village in Gura-ri, Iseo-myeon, Cheongdo-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, believed to have been established by Ban Ye () in the mid-1500s. As late as the 1970s, about 80 households with this family name lived there, but by 2012 that had declined to around 50. #Nampyeong: 2,227 people and 676 households. They are a sub-branch of the Giseong Ban clan. They claim descent from Ban Yu-hyeon (), an official under Gongmin of Goryeo, and through him descent from the Geoje Ban clan's ancestor Ban Bu. #Gyeolseong: 441 people and 133 households. #Eumseong: 408 people and 108 households. #Other or unknown bon-gwan: 64 people and 16 households.

Police later reported that the rape never occurred. At his arraignment, Ntshongwana was violent and spoke in tongues. At a mental competency hearing in January 2012, it was revealed that Ntshongwana, now known as \\"The Axe Man\\", was mentally ill, suffering from schizoaffective disorder. His father told the court his son suffered from bipolar disorder. A psychiatrist testified that Ntshongwana was not mentally unstable and that the murders were premeditated and deliberate. In February 2012, a Durban court declared him fit to stand trial.

Part of the Gujarati subfamily, Kachi Koli is closely related to Parkari Koli and Wadiyara Koli. ==References== Category:Languages of India Category:Indo-Aryan languages Category:Languages of Gujarat ","title":"Kachi Koli language"},{"id":"35271338","text":"Wadiyara Koli is an Indo-Aryan language of the Gujarati group. It is spoken by the Wadiyara people, who originate from Wadiyar in Gujarat; many of whom are thought to have migrated to Sindh in the early twentieth century, following the onset of famine.The Wadiyara people are affiliated with the Bhil people and Koli people, but are generally more inclined towards associating themselves with the Koli; they are often regarded as a subgroup of the latter. ==Phonology== Vowels Wadiyari possesses eight distinct oral monophthongs coupled with five nasal monophthongs, in addition to five oral diphthongs and two contrastive nasal diphthongs. Oral vowels are also assimilated before nasal consonants. Monophthongs The word-initial occurrence of close front oral monophthongs is exceedingly rare. Generally, the close back monophthong is the most regular; but this is also uncommon in word-initial contexts. The short nasal monophthong is decidedly less frequent than its nasal counterparts, while the mid-back nasal monophthong does not occur word- finally. Occurrences of nasal monophthongs word-initially are extremely uncommon. Diphthongs No oral diphthongs can occur word-initially. As a whole, diphthongs are profoundly limited in occurrence; some can only occur word-medially and others word-finally. {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! !!Front !! Central !!Back - !

Open  ()  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" } Consonants Wadiyara Koli possesses 38 distinct phonemic consonants, which entail seven places and eight manners of articulation. Implosives and plosives Implosives in Wadiyari involve five different places of articulation. It is noteworthy that bilabial and dental implosives do not appear word-finally; and the manifestation of the pre-palatal/palatal implosive is relatively less frequent. Wadiyara Koli's 16 plosive consonants have four places of articulation: the bilabial, alveolar, retroflex, and velar. There are clear contrasts between voicing and unvoicing, as well an unaspirated and aspirated consonants. Plosives are generally unrestricted, with the exception of the voiced bilabial and voiced retroflex aspirated stops. These do not appear word-finally, although it is important to note that the other aspirated plosives do so rather infrequently. Nasal consonants Wadiyari possesses four discernible nasal phonemes; the bilabial, the alveolar, the retroflex, and the velar; the latter two are restricted. The retroflex nasal is visible word-medially and word-finally, but never at the beginning of a word. However, it does manifest itself pre- syllabically. The velar nasal is similarly constrained, and also exclusive to the coda of a syllable. Most of the time it is followed by the voiced velar plosive, but it can also be followed by the lateral retroflex, as well as occurring independently. Fricatives and affricates Unusually for Indo- Aryan languages, four distinct phonemic fricatives are recorded in Wadiyari; contrasting at three places of articulation: the alveolar, the post-alveolar, and the glottal. All of these are unrestricted. A labiodental fricative was also observed; however, this is wholly restricted to Persian loanwords. Alveolar fricatives are often affricatized. The post-alveolar produces three distinct affricates: the voiced, the voiceless, and the voiceless aspirated. The latter cannot occur word-finally; the unaspirated counterparts can, but not regularly. Flaps, laterals, and approximants The alveolar flap and retroflex flap are distinguished at two places of articulation: the alveolar and the retroflex. The former is sometimes articulated as a trill, and the latter only cocurs word-medially or word-finally. Unlike some Indo-Aryan languages, the retroflex flap stands in contrastive distribution with the voiced retroflex stop. Like flaps, Wadiyari possesses two separate laterals at two separate places of articulation: the alveolar and the retroflex. The former is unrestricted in its occurrence, unlike the latter, which can only occur word-medially and word-finally. Wadiyari has a bilabial approximant in addition to a palatal approximant; the latter is restricted to word-initial and word-medial occurrences. {  style=text-align:center - !colspan=2 ! Labial !

Rip Slyme debuted as an independent act on File Records in 1995, releasing material with them until their major label debut under Warner Music Japan in 2000. The band's second album under Warner, Tokyo Classic (2002) was a commercial success, selling over 1,000,000 copies. Some of the band's most commercially successful songs include \\"Rakuen Baby\\" (2002) and \\"Nettaiya\\" (2007), summer-themed songs that have both been certified Platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Rip Slyme collaborated with the rock band Quruli twice in 2006, when they released the singles \\"Lovi\\" and \\"Juice\\" simultaneously. The group have worked together with guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei twice: once in 2006 on the single \\"Battle Funkastic\\" that mashed-up Rip Slyme's \\"Funkastic\\" with Hotei's \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\\" (2000), and in 2011 when Rip Slyme recorded a cover of Hotei's song \\"Bambina\\" for his collaborations album All Time Super Guest. == Studio albums == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions - ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! style=\\"width:16em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album details ! colspan=\\"1\\" Peak positions ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sales (JPN) ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications - ! style=\\"width:2.5em;\\"JPN - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Talkin' Cheap  *Released: February 21, 1998 *Label: File Records *Formats: CD, digital download  ‚Äî  align=\\"left\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Five  *Released: July 25, 2001 *Label: Warner Music Japan *Formats: CD, digital download  6  312,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tokyo Classic  *Released: July 24, 2002 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  1  955,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Million - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Time to Go  *Released: July 16, 2003 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  1  391,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: 2√ó Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Masterpiece  *Released: November 3, 2004 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  2  268,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Epoch  *Released: November 29, 2006 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  5  123,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Funfair  *Released: November 28, 2007 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  2  134,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Journey  *Released: June 10, 2009 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, CD/DVD, digital download  4  83,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Star  *Released: March 2, 2011 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  7  34,000 align=\\"left\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Golden Time  *Released: December 4, 2013 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, CD/DVD, digital download  7  30,000 align=\\"left\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  10  *Released: September 30, 2015 *Label: Warner *Formats: CD, digital download  13  13,000 align=\\"left\\" } == Compilation albums == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions - ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! style=\\"width:16em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album details ! colspan=\\"1\\" Peak positions ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sales (JPN) ! style=\\"width:12em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications - ! style=\\"width:2.5em;\\"JPN - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Yapparip: Ultime Early Years Collection 1995‚Äî2000  * Released: October 10, 2003 * Label: File Records * Formats: CD, digital download  7  60,000 align=\\"left\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"   * Released: August 31, 2005 * Label: Warner * Formats: CD, digital download  1  546,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: 2√ó Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Good Times  * Released: August 4, 2010 * Label: Warner * Formats: 2CD, 2CD/DVD, 2LP, digital download  2  191,000 align=\\"left\\" *RIAJ: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bad Times  * Released: December 1, 2010 * Label: Warner * Formats: 2CD, digital download  11  31,000 align=\\"left\\" } == Extended plays == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

He attended primary school and secondary school respectively at the Catholic mission in Grand-Popo and the Minor Seminary of St. Joan of Arc in Ouidah from 1915 to 1919. He taught at the Catholic school in Grand Popo from 1919 to 1924. Between 1924 and 1939 Couchoro managed a branch of the Soci√©t√© Commerciale de l‚ÄôOuest Africain (SCOA). In 1929, Couchoro's first book, L'Esclave, was published in Paris, the second novel published by an African in French, but the book remained obscure for years. He edited the newspaper √âveil Togolais from 1931 to 1933, which was renamed √âveil Togo-Dahom√©en. In the paper, he advocated for greater freedom of trade between Benin and Togo. Couchoro invented Onitsha-style chapbooks during this time. In 1939, police harassment forced him to take refuge in Aneho in Togo. From 1939 to 1952, he worked as a business agent in Anecho and became a nationalist in the Committee of the Togolese Unit (CUT), Sylvanus Olympio's party. He began publishing books in serial form in the newspaper Togo-Presse, beginning with Amour de f√©ticheuse in 1941. He worked on the editorial team of several newspapers that advocated for decolonization. However, he soon became the target of police repression again. After a riot in Vogan in 1952, he escaped to Aflao, Ghana, to avoid being jailed. His business failed and he was frequently low on money in Ghana.

Dickes worked as apprentice to the wood-engraver Robert Edward Branston, Allen Robert Branston's son, in about 1831. He studied at the Royal Academy Schools in 1835 and displayed examples of oil-colour printing at the Great Exhibition. He founded William Dickes & Company in London about 1864, his workshop and office being at 48 Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, London (1846‚Äì48); 4 Crescent Place, Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London (1849‚Äì51); 5 Old Fish Street, Doctor's Common, London (c.1852); 109 Farringdon Road, London (c.1867-1875). Dickes retired in 1873. William Dickes was one of a group of London-based wood-engravers who saw in the developing market for illustration a great opportunity to profitably use their technical and artistic skills - the burgeoning book and periodical trade in London created an insatiable demand for images. Dickes assembled a team of wood-engravers between 1842 and 1847 to illustrate the Abbotsford edition of Walter Scott's work.Dictionary of nineteenth-century journalism in Great Britain - Laurel Brake, Marysa Demoor Dickes specialised in illustrating books on natural history‚Äîsuch as works by Anne Pratt‚Äî and was a licensee of the Baxter Process of printing.The illustrator and the book in England from 1790 to 1914 - Gordon Norton RayToronto Public Library His biographer, Alfred Docker, bequeathed 1370 works by Dickes to the British Museum in 1931 and these are kept at Blythe House.British Museum Dickes collected many awards for the quality of his lithography. Although starting with wood-engraving, he moved to and developed new processes in colour lithography using copper plates. His work was exhibited at International Exhibitions in London, Dublin and Paris in the 1860s. Chromolithography reached its pinnacle toward the end of the 1800s. Colour images were printed using multiple stones, each printing a different colour in a process calling for precise alignment. ==Illustrations== * Glaucus or The Wonders of the Shore - Charles Kingsley, MacMillan & Co., 1859 * Actinologia Britannica - A History of the British Sea- Anemones and Corals - Philip Henry Gosse, Van Voorst, 1860 * Studies from the Great Masters - Rev.

In the 1860s, a group of pious and enthusiastic Dutch Voortrekkers known as the Jerusalemgangers, saw the large flooded plain with its wide river flowing lazily northwards and were under the impression that they had arrived at the mighty Nylrivier, the Nile river. They settled the place and founded a town in 1866, calling it Nylstroom. ==Course== The Nyl river is fed mostly by smaller tributaries flowing from the Waterberg Massif that flow roughly northeastwards into a wide and shallow plain with a very feeble gradient. The main stream is known as Groot Nyl and has its sources to the east of Bela-Bela (Warmbad). Its most important tributaries are the Olifantspruit and the Tobiasspruit. Other tributaries are the Klein Nyl, Middelfonteinspruit, Hessie-se-Water, De Wet Zyn Loop, Bad se Loop, Andriesspruit, Kotjie se Loop and the Dorpspruit.Hydrological and hydraulic modelling of the Nyl River floodplain The Nyl plain becomes seasonally flooded and is full of reeds and other aquatic plants. It is known as Nylsvlei, from the word vlei usually applied to intermittent lakes, for the main course in its midst flows northeastwards very slowly. Further on it bends northwards as the north-leaning gradient of the river tilts to a sharper angle.

He was at first held in Kamiti Prison, and later in Shimo la Tewa Prison, where he was kept in solitary confinement. It was while imprisoned that he wrote the poems that would be collected in the 1973 work Sauti ya Dhiki. These were written in the Mombasa version of the Swahili language and published by his older brother Sheikh Abdilahi Nassir. He later explained that writing the poems in solitary confinement had kept him sane. After he was awarded the Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature for Sauti ya Dhiki in 1972, he moved in exile to Tanzania.

On 28 June 2012, Pond had a one-off performance with Can frontman Damo Suzuki, one of Pond's biggest inspirations and musical idols. Originally, Man It Feels Like Space Again was planned to be the next Pond album, but instead Hobo Rocket was chosen to be recorded beforehand and was released on 6 August 2013. Pond described Hobo Rocket as being \\"much better\\" than Beard, Wives, Denim. Man It Feels Like Space Again, their sixth studio album, was later released on 23 January 2015. Pond announced their seventh album The Weather, released on 7 May 2017 via Marathon Artists. The announcement came with the release of two singles, \\"30000 Megatons\\" and \\"Sweep Me Off My Feet\\". The title and chorus of the first song refer to the 30,000 nuclear warheads in the arsenal of the Earth. As with their previous album, The Weather was produced by Kevin Parker at his studio in Perth. The album was preceded by the release of two more singles, \\"The Weather\\" and \\"Paint Me Silver\\". The album was released to critical acclaim, with many publications praising it as an evolution and maturation of the band's sound and songwriting. A little over a year after the release of The Weather, on 23 July, Pond released the single \\"Burnt Out Star\\", along with new tour dates. The band then released the single \\"Sixteen Days\\" on 5 October along with an accompanying music video. The single \\"Daisy\\" was released on 10 January 2019 with a music video that was filmed on land for which the Kulin and Nyoongar Nations were the traditional custodians, with the band paying respect to them in the opening card. Along with the release of this single, the band announced through social media their eighth studio album, Tasmania, which was released through Interscope Records on 1 March 2019 to similar acclaim as The Weather. Days after the release of Tasmania, the band toured locally, with performances at Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. It would be their first local tour since 2017. Later that year they would go on to tour Europe and the UK. On 9 September 2019, the band announced a live album, Sessions, which was released on 8 November 2019. To promote it they released the single \\"Don't Look At the Sun (Or You'll Go Blind)\\", an updated live version of a song featured on their debut album Psychedelic Mango. As of October 2019, the band is currently recording their ninth studio album. ==Band members== Current * Nick Allbrook - vocals, guitar, keys, bass, flute, slide guitar, occasional drums (2008-present) * Jay \\"Gumby\\" Watson - vocals, guitar, keys, drums, synthesizer, occasional bass (2008-present) * Shiny Joe Ryan - vocals, guitar, bass, 12 string guitar, slide guitar (2008-present) * Jamie Terry - keys, bass, synth, organ, occasional guitar (2008-present) * James Ireland - drums, occasional keys (2016-present) Contributors and occasional/former members * Kevin Parker - drums (2009-2011), production and mixing (2012-present) * Nick Odell - congas * Richard Ingham - guitar * Matthew Saville - drums (2009) * Julien Barbagallo - bass (2014-2015) * Cam Avery - drums (2012-2014) * Ben McDonald - bass (2014) Timeline ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:120 bottom:100 top:20 right:40 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2008 till:12/31/2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical columns:4 position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2008 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2008 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:lines value:black legend:Studio_albums id:bars value:gray(0.9) BackgroundColors = bars:bars LineData = layer:back color:lines at:01/09/2009 at:06/04/2009 at:05/24/2010 at:03/02/2012 at:08/02/2013 at:01/23/2015 at:05/05/2017 at:03/01/2019 BarData = bar:Nick text:\\"Nick Allbrook\\" bar:Joseph text:\\"Joseph Ryan\\" bar:Jamie text:\\"Jamie Terry\\" bar:Jay text:\\"Jay Watson\\" bar:Matthew text:\\"Matthew Saville\\" bar:Kevin text:\\"Kevin Parker\\" bar:Cam text:\\"Cam Avery\\" bar:James text:\\"James Ireland\\" PlotData= width:13 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Nick from:start till:end color:vocals bar:Nick from:start till:end color:guitar width:3 bar:Nick from:start till:end color:bass width:5 bar:Nick from:start till:end color:keys width:7 bar:Joseph from:start till:end color:guitar bar:Joseph from:start till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Joseph from:start till:end color:bass width:7 bar:Jamie from:start till:end color:keys bar:Jamie from:start till:end color:bass width:3 bar:Jamie from:start till:end color:guitar width:7 bar:Jay from:start till:02/28/2009 color:drums bar:Jay from:03/01/2009 till:end color:bass bar:Jay from:start till:02/28/2009 color:bass width:9 bar:Jay from:03/01/2009 till:end color:drums width:9 bar:Jay from:start till:end color:guitar width:5 bar:Jay from:start till:end color:keys width:7 bar:Jay from:start till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Matthew from:03/01/2009 till:08/31/2009 color:drums bar:Kevin from:09/01/2009 till:12/31/2011 color:drums bar:Cam from:01/01/2012 till:12/31/2014 color:drums bar:James from:01/01/2016 till:end color:drums ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of studio albums, with selected chart positions !

A well-known Somali poet Abdullahi Moalin Ahmed ‚ÄúDhoodaan‚Äù died at age of 72 in the city of Harar. He was one of the pioneers of Somali poetry and arguably one of the greatest poet of the last century. He was born within a family of shepherds from the Ogaden, he could not have a formal education. == Early life == Born to a nomadic pastoralist family, he had what could have been speech and language delay disorder at an early age. Young Dhoodaan during those years was a very shy, quiet, and observant child, many thought he will never speak again. Not surprising for a nomadic society that had little knowledge of disorders or its diagnosis techniques. Little did they know what was boiling under his prolonged silence and like a volcano he erupted. What followed was a miracle, not only was he able to speak but was able to do so flawlessly through poetry. He spoke elegantly and with ease, unusual for a child, yet what people didn't understand was where he acquired such a skill. Poetry did not run in his blood line, in fact none of his family history was known for poetry. But because he didn't have the ability to speak at an early age, he compensated it through observation. He made sense of his surroundings by silently constructing words in his mind. This would later become poetry, and through this poetry he would later speak about the issues facing his community; whether it was famine, war or love. He did not shy away from challenging the status quo, and the leaders of his community. From that point, it was clear that he was not an ordinary young boy, but a legend in the making. == Cultural Impact == Dhoodaan was from the Somali region of Ethiopia (Ogaden) and just like many others he fled the conflict in Ethiopia and moved to Somalia. It was no surprise that he immediately challenged and spoke critically against the authoritarian regime of Dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in his newly adopted country. After the failure of the 1977 Ogaden War, he openly criticized and condemned the Barre regime for turning the war into a border issue and a disputed territory between Somalia and Ethiopia. He was famously known for his support of the movements for the secession of Ogaden, as was depicted in many of his poems. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Somalian poets Category:Ethiopian poets Category:2013 deaths Category:Ethiopian emigrants to Somalia Category:20th-century poets Category:21st-century poets ","title":"Dhoodaan"},{"id":"35271696","text":"Thirukannapuram is a village in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Nagapattinam District.Revenue Villages A popular Perumal temple (Neelmegha Perumal) is there.

Their communication was primarily with hearing people, and so was strongly influenced by Albanian, with extensive use of fingerspelling and initialized signs, along with some gestures borrowed from hearing people. After the collapse of communism, deaf people began to congregate and a fully- fledged sign language developed. They invented new signs to replace the former use of fingerspelling, and also came into contact with International Sign and other European sign languages, resulting in numerous loan words.

While living in Tarragona, she wrote using the pseudonym Josep Miralles. She was later known by her married name, Maria Dom√®nech de Ca√±ellas. == Biography == Maria's father died when she was eight months old. At the age of three, she and her mother moved to Tarragona and Maria took private lessons from her mother. Later, she wrote with the philosopher Tom√†s Sucona, painted with the painter Hermenegildo Vallv√©, and learned music with Father Joan Roca, because she refused to go to the Carmelite school.  Social activist and writer  Dom√®nech contributed to several publications including La P√†tria and Camp de Tarragona using the pseudonym Josep Miralles (not to be confused with Bishop Josep Miralles i Sbert (1860-1947)).Maria Dom√®nech Escot√© al Diccionari Biogr√†fic de Dones In 1910, Dom√©nech settled in Barcelona with her husband, a doctor from Tarragona, Francesc Ca√±ellas, and their two children. There she started her social activism and collaborated with more magazines: Or i Grana, La Tralla, Feminal, El Poble Catal√†, Renaixement, La Veu de Catalunya. For Feminal (a feminist publication), she had become a local correspondent when she lived in Tarragona, and when the Ca√±ellas family moved to Barcelona, she became a collaborator with the magazine, which disappeared in 1917. According to Cavall√©, in those pages, \\"she published a number of short literary texts, which she would later include in her books.\\" One of her first appearances in public as a social activist was on behalf of the Board of Ladies of the League Against Tuberculosis in Girona, in a distribution of awards to mothers who had breastfed their children longer. She took an active part in the Women's Charity Tomb, chaired by Dolors Monserd√†. She was a member of the Public Instruction and Child Protection Boards of Tarragona, member of the Board of the \\"Liga del Bon Mot\\" (League of the Good Word), member of the \\"Junta de Primera Ense√±anza de Tarragona\\" (Board of First Education of Tarragona) and member of the \\"Junta de Protecci√≥n a Childhood\\" (Board to Protect Childhood). She was also the third vice-president of the Women's Federation against Tuberculosis, which was chaired by Leonor Canalejas de Farga.Buck, Claire (1992). Bloomsbury guide to women's literature. London: Bloomsbury. . OCLC 185786618. Dom√©nech participated in the women's philanthropic and educational movement, carried out by Francesca Bonnemaison, Dolors Monserd√† and Carme Karr i Alfonsetti. She gave several conferences in favor of women and their status as workers throughout Catalonia and Madrid. In 1912, she founded and chaired the Workers' Federation, with the aim of providing women with access to culture and education, as well as defending their rights as workers. Throughout the years, she was also an active writer. In 1915, Dom√©nech published a collection of poems and narratives entitled Verso i prosa, as well as the novels Neus (1914), Contrallum (1917), Golden Toads (1919) and Inheritance (1925). Dom√©nech collaborated with the Barcelona Institute of Social Reforms (1918) and gave speeches on the condition of women, work at home, and workers and women's professions at the Ateneu Barcelon√®s and other institutions such as the Agrupaci√≥ Feminal and the Social Museum of Barcelona. In 1923 she attended commissions in Switzerland for the \\"study of institutions\\" aimed at the protection, moral progress and material well-being of all workers, not just women.  Member of Congress  For a month in 1930, she was a Member of the Congress in Madrid, and she was the first Assistant Inspector of Work in Spain.  Later years  In 1946 she published a collection of poems, Al rodar del temps, and a novel in Spanish, Confidencias. According to Cavall√©, Maria Domknech's social activity was remarkable \\"due to the large number of tasks she participated in and the role that she played in the ideological search of Catalan society, mainly as regards the role of women. He goes on to say, \\"she regards man and woman as 'the two essential parts of the whole called humanity.' Both are of an identical nature, but each presents 'those variants which are proper to the modalities which were assigned to them in their creation.'\\" == Selected works == Poetry  * Al rodar del temps (As time rolls by) (1946) The following were contributions to the Floral Games in Barcelona:Arxiu Hist√≤ric de la Ciutat de Barcelona.

He collected and published ancient hymns and folk songs which is his finest contribution to the preservation of Nepalese cultural heritage.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 12. Page 67. ==Early life== Tuladhar was born to a merchant family at Asan Kamalachhi, Kathmandu. His father was Ratna Das and mother Laxmi Shobha Tuladhar. When he was 16 years old, he was married to Dhan Maya, the daughter of Dharma Sundar Tuladhar of Dhalasikwa, Kathmandu.Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 33. After his father's death in 1921, the burden of running the household fell on him, and he went to Lhasa, Tibet to take over the family shop. It wasn't very successful, so he returned to Kathmandu. Later, he moved to Kalimpong and then Sikkim in India and engaged in various businesses. He returned to Nepal after a few years.Prem Shanti (ed.), Tuladhar (2010). Newa: Folklore. Yala: Central Department of Nepal Bhasa, Tribhuvan University. . Page 85. ==Career== In 1931, Tuladhar and a group of other liberal-minded people including poet Yogbir Singh Kansakar started a movement to reform traditional religious customs. They were arrested and publicly flogged for their activities by the Rana regime. They were then brought before the prime minister and released after a warning \\"not to indulge in such mischievous activities again\\". Pages 35-36. In 1934, Tuladhar teamed up with his nephew poet Chittadhar HridayaLewis, Todd T. and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009).

It gradually transformed into a book store as both uncle and nephew were keen readers. Access to education and books was difficult at the time, and their book store became a hub for students and writers. Subsequently, Tuladhar established two publishing firms named Mandas SugatdasR.R. Bowker Company (1980). International literary market place. Bowker. , 9780835212946. and Himalaya Pioneer Publication to promote writers and expand the country's corpus of books. Tuladhar's other interest was Nepal Bhasa poetry, and he spent 48 years collecting hymns, folk songs and sacred texts in an effort to preserve Nepal's literary, cultural and musical heritage. He toured the Kathmandu Valley and gathered thousands of Hindu and Buddhist hymns in Nepal Bhasa and 275 Sanskrit songs, becoming an authority on old songs.Lienhard, Siegfried and Malla (King of Lalitpur), Siddhinarasimha (1995).

Its headquarters are located in the Moi√† airfield in the BCN Drone Center, 40 km north of Barcelona, Spain. ==History== CATUAV is a company involved in developing UAV technologies for aerial image acquisition purposes in Europe. The first UAV prototype was built in 2003, as a new business line within Aeroplans Blaus S.L., a company dedicated to experimental and sport aviation equipment. During this period some surveillance UAV systems were developed as part of a strategic agreement with Proytecsa and Indra. In 2007 the UAV business line had grown enough to create a new company, CATUAV, founded to provide all the services offered with these systems. In 2008 the company signed a strategic agreement with AURENSIS, a Telespazio/Finmeccanica company. Since then CATUAV has performed more than 100 commercial missions in the civil market. ==Technologies== The Atmos6 unmanned aerial vehicle, for civil applications Since 2003 CATUAV has developed different technologies in order to perform its services: * Atmos series: Mini- UAV that weighs less than 2 kg and can carry a payload of up to 500g. Powered with an electric motor this is a platform that is used primarily for mapping projects. The current version is Atmos-6, which is an evolution of the five previous models (from Atmos-1 to Atmos-5) * Furos: A medium-range UAV that thanks to its gasoline engine can fly for six hours and cover distances of over 400 km guided by autopilot. The cargo bay has ample space for payload in the central area of the fuselage and the nose has a modular system designed to accommodate thermal cameras. The high power of its engine and its special streamlined design allows to take off and land in very little space from unprepared terrain. It can reach a top speed of 145 km / h and climb to 3,000 m in less than ten minutes. Equipped with a new video link and long-range data link can be manually controlled to 20 km or undertake missions on their pre- programmed autopilot. It weighs less than 11 kg and can carry a payload of up to 5 kg (including fuel). * Argos: Evolution of the Furos, this UAV weighs less than 12 kg and can carry a payload up to 6,25 kg (including fuel). Powered with a fuel engine it can fly for up to 14 hours, making it CATUAV's longest enduring platform. It has a big cargo bay that is easy to adapt to different payloads and a long endurance to get the maximum of each flight. ARGOS is an easy to deploy, easy to fly mid-range platform that has a conventional landing gear for taking off from very short runways or a special hook for catapult launching when there is no runway available. Wings are foldable in less than five minutes for easy transportation even in small vehicles. * Mineos: a versatile mini-UAV with a silent electrical propulsion system. Its small size allows to perform a great variety of missions, it is ideal for video surveillance, photogrammetry, filming and as a platform for scientific and remote sensing applications. It has GPS navigation system, automatic stabilizer system and emergency locator transmitter. The new MINEOS is foldable and easy to carry in any vehicle. * Telemetry data link: CATUAV has its own telemetry protocol that ensures the security and safety of all the communications. The UAVs can be controlled in a 15 km radius with a radio frequency link. This range can be extended using a satellite link. * ground control station: In order to operate the UAV, CATUAV has developed a towable ground station with all the equipment required to deploy and operate the UAVs and read all the telemetry data. It also has a portable ground station for missions that do not have path access. * Mission software: CATUAV is operating its own planning and control mission software, specially adapted to its UAV platforms and application requirements. CATUAV also operates third party products that play a role in its activity, such as: * Falcon 8 blades multirotor. * Thermoteknix: a high resolution thermal camera. * EnsoMosaic software: this software package allows the creation of orthophoto mosaics and digital elevation model (DEM). ==Services== Some services the company offers include:  Orthophotos  Orthophotos are aerial photographies that have been geometrically corrected such that the scale is uniform, having each pixel an associated geographic coordinate. Orthophotos have the same lack of distortion as maps, so they are an accurate representation of the Earth's surface that can be used to measure distances. Using photogrammetric software the aerial images acquired with UAV systems can be rectified and merged in order to create orthorectified image mosaics of the desired extension. The orthophotos have a resolution between 5 cm to 2m/p√≠xel. In one flight, areas up to 1000 hectares can be detected. The generation of the orthophotos is made using software that automatically applies photogrammetric principles to rectify the images. As input, it needs georeferenced aerial images and the usage of a calibrated camera. This process leads to submeter precisions in the full orthophoto extension, which can still be increased adding manual control points. The UAV systems can be equipped with multiple cameras, allowing us the acquisition of images in multiple spectral bands: visible, near infrared, thermal, hyperspectral. Those images can be postprocessed (for example to compute vegetation index) and orthophotos can be generated for each spectral band, resulting in a huge range of applications: * precision agriculture * Forestry management * Environmental studies * Hydrology * Landmine detection * Archaeological work * Town illumination management * Light pollution studies * Fire detection * Energy efficiency studies * Waste management * Surveillance  Digital elevation models for GIS applications  A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a continuous 3D representation of a terrain surface area that has been geometrically corrected, so it can be used to measure distances and heights. Two main kinds of DEM can be generated: * Digital Terrain Model (DTM): 3D representation of the terrain base surface without vegetation and artificial objects. * Digital Surface Model (DSM): 3D representation of all elements in the area. CATUAV systems generate a DTM in every flight as a product of the rectification process. From this previous DTM, with more intensive software procedures, a dense Point Cloud 3D model can be generated, from which a high-resolution DSM can be derived. Obtaining in the same flight an orthophoto plus a DEM, provides a high quality and low-cost product that can be used to support any topography and cartography work. With further processing, dense Point Cloud and DSM can also be obtained, which leads to applications in multiple fields: * Topography * Mining * Forestry management * Civil Works * Geology  Non metric, oblique aerial images  If the onboard camera pose has a certain angle from the vertical direction oblique images are obtained, which allows the obtaining of an aerial perspective of the scene. Thanks to the use of an onboard GPS and inertial system, each image acquired can be automatically georeferenced. The aerial perspective obtained with this kind of images makes it possible to see the scene from a bird's point of view and leads to numerous applications where they are useful: * Civil works management * Power lines maintenance * Energy efficiency in buildings * 360¬∫ panorama creation  Atmospheric data  The systems can be equipped with any desired sensors in order to obtain atmospheric data such as temperature, pressure, CO2 concentration, etc. This data can be used to perform atmospheric prospection and environmental studies. ==Featured missions== * Lorca earthquake: In May 2011 CATUAV performed a series of flights over Lorca (Spanish town in Murcia) 38 hours after it was struck by a strong earthquake. The high resolution orthophoto created from the town allowed the emergency services to evaluate and quantify the damages in buildings. This is the first known application of a mini-UAV in a civil emergency in Europe. * SAFEDEM project: CATUAV is participating in the SAFEDEM project of the ESA to develop a system capable of helping in the demining works in Bosnia. ==Awards== CATUAV has been awarded the Galileo Masters European GNSS Agency (GSA) special topic prize and regional prize in 2011 for its TCAS for mini UAV project. Other awards: * ESNC Regional Prize * Innovacat (2012) * Premi Medi Ambient (2012) * Drone social innovation award * Nit de la robotica (2015) ==References * Official CATUAV website * Official CATUAV UAV Test Site Category:Companies based in Catalonia Category:Technology companies of Spain Category:Unmanned aerial vehicle manufacturers Category:Spanish brands ","title":"CATUAV"},{"id":"35271980","text":"Uli Waas (born 1949, in Donauw√∂rth) is a German writer and illustrator.

Unlike his brother Paul van Vianen, he spent little time away from his native Utrecht. Together they developed the auricular style which bridges the gap between Northern Mannerist and Baroque ornament.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" ==Biography== Van Vianen was born and died in Utrecht. He was the oldest son of Willem Eerstensz. van Vianen, the brother of Paulus Willemsz. van Vianen and the father of Christian van Vianen. He probably trained with a local goldsmith, learning engraving, as most goldsmiths did. A handful of prints can be identified as his, including two portraits and a map of Utrecht. His earliest surviving piece of silver is a standing cup of 1594, now in the Hermitage Museum.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" On 12 October 1593, he married Aeltgen Verhorst, with whom he had a son. After his wife's death, he married Catharina van Wapenveldt, with whom he had three children. He is believed to have died on 25 or 26 August 1627. Adam van Vianen's son Christian was considered to be his father's equal in skill, according to Joachim von Sandrart. He became known along with his brother for the auricular style of cartilaginous arabesques in baroque art. According to some, Paulus designed them and Adam transformed them into three-dimensional objects. ==Memorial ewer of 1614== Memorial gilded ewer of 1614 Especially important is a gilded ewer of 1614 in the Rijksmuseum.Rijksmuseum page: Adam van Vianen 1614 This is \\"a strikingly original work that is largely abstract and completely sculptural in its conception\\", and was commissioned by the Amsterdam goldsmiths' guild to commemorate the death of Paul in 1613, despite neither brother living in Amsterdam or being a member of the guild.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" The piece became famous and appears in several Dutch Golden Age paintings, both still lifes and history paintings, \\"no doubt in part because its bizarre form allowed it to pass as an object from an ancient and foreign land\\", and so useful for Old Testament scenes and the like.Liedtke (2007), 186-188, giving examples including Joseph and his brothers (this is the Warsaw version) by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. According to James Trilling, it \\"is one of the very few ornamental works that deserve recognition as art-historical turning points. Van Vianen's breakthrough was the introduction of inchoate or indeterminate form, which paved the way for both Rococo and modernist ornament.\\"Trilling, James, The Language of Ornament, p. 66, 2001, Thames and Hudson, ; see the index for further mentions It was raised by a lengthy process of chasing from a single sheet of silver, and chasing was the main technique used in auricular silver.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" Plaquette with the Wedding of Peleus and Thetis after Abraham Bloemaert ==ReferencesFurther reading== *E.A.

He signed for SC Eendracht Aalst in 2019 after playing for FCV Dender EH for 3 years, having previously been one of the crowd favourites for the club Royal Union Saint-Gilloise, having played an integral part in their promotion to the Belgian Second Division during the 2014‚Äì15 season. Quickly after his arrival at FCV Dender EH he started making an impact at his new club and with his total of 18 goals he contributed greatly to the successful 2016‚Äì17 season. Even though the 2017-2018 season is less successful for FCV Dender EH, Cocchiere still managed to score 12 goals. In 2018-2019 he managed to score another 13 goals, after the 2018-2019 season, he went to SC Eendracht Aalst who were relegated to the Second Division Amateurs. == Football career ==  Youth career  Born in Varese, Lombardy, Cocchiere signed his first professional contract mid-2006 for top Serie A club Internazionale at the age of 18, where he joined the reserve team. Like most of his new Primavera under-20 reserve teammates, Cocchiere received a first- team shirt number of no.56. At the Inter reserves he played in a very strong youth team, featuring Mario Balotelli, Jonathan Biabiany and Leonardo Bonucci among others, resulting in winning the Primavera league.  Lega Pro  After graduation from the Reserves, Cocchiere left for Pizzighettone in late- August 2007. As the club also signed several experienced players, the young Cocchiere featured only in two matches that season. In 2008‚Äì09 Lega Pro Prima Divisione, he was signed by Pro Patria. Cocchiere had few chances to play for the first team and the fact that he combined his football career with studying at university meant he looked for opportunities elsewhere.http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/?action=read&id;=140412  Switzerland  Cocchiere found the opportunity to combine both careers when he was signed by Swiss Challenge League club Nyon in 2010, and he simultaneously enrolled in Political Science at the University of Geneva. As a result of the Swiss maximum number of foreign players he was initially loaned out to Swiss 1. Liga club Baulmes. Here he had a successful run of games playing an attacking right-back and contributed to the club's great form with an impressive number of 7 goals in 12 games. His goal scoring record attracted the attention of several first league clubs and this contributed to the decision of Nyon to call him back to the club and add him to the squad in summer of 2010. However, after only a handful appearances partly due to a rare injury in his career, Cocchiere was released in summer of 2011 when he decided not to accept any of the received offers from Swiss Second Division clubs and to return to Italy to finish his university degree. Cocchiere then returned to Italy to finish he master's degree Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore at and signed for Serie D club Gallaratese. At the club he scored 5 goals in 11 games. On 4 January 2012, he was signed by Caronnese, where he stayed for one season during which he finished his degree.  Belgium  Cocchiere moved to Brussels where he signed for Royal Union Saint-Gilloise and combined his football career with a career working for the European Parliament. After some very successful seasons playing for Union and scoring some crucial memorable goals, Cocchiere started featuring less in the starting eleven during season 2015-2016, much to the disliking of many of the fans. This eventually lead to his departure and Cocchiere found a new challenge at FCV Dender EH, signing a one-year contract with an option of one more year. He quoted the reputation and great infrastructure of the club as some of the reasons for signing. Here he quickly found his rhythm and form; being voted as 'Man of the Match' by Dender fans on frequent occasions and scoring 12 goals in his first 16 official games. His successful first season, seeing him netting 20 goals, led the club to offering him an improved contract in April 2017, shortly before the league's playoffs. In the current season Cocchiere has scored thirteen goals, despite the disappointing league position of his club, Cocchiere has scored 13 goals so far this season. == Personal life ==  European Parliament  Ignazio Cocchiere has always combined his professional football career with academic activities, studying at university in many of the countries he played. Having successfully combined his studies with practicing his sport full-time, he continued combining both careers also after graduation. In Brussels he found a job working at the European Parliament, where he has worked for more than four years now. In his interview with Eurosport on April 25 April 2017, he recommended all young football player to keep an alternative career path in mind and stressed that his job in the European Parliament was another reason he expects to be playing football in Belgium the years to come. As a result of playing for local cult club Royale Union Saint-Gilloise and working in the so-called 'Brussels Bubble', Cocchiere has become a well-known and respected figure in the local scene, resulting regularly in a lot of media coverage. ==References * Swiss Football League Profile Category:Italian footballers Category:A.C.

The book is a comprehensive compilation of facts, milestones, and other details regarding paper money in India. It was published in India by Coins & Currencies. Kishore Jhunjhunwalla and Rezwan Razack are avid collectors of Indian currency. The book traces the evolution of Indian currency dating back to 1770. It captures the various nuances of modern-day currency as well as incidents that helped shape this sector over the years. The book is in its second edition‚Äîthe first was authored by Jhunjhunwalla, whose collection was later purchased by Razack. The revised edition was published after 10 years of research. The book was introduced to the public by Uma Shankar, Regional Director of the Reserve Bank of India on January 13, 2012. ==Summary== The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money‚Äô‚Äô includes high resolution colour images of notes from Semi-Government and Presidency Banks, which functioned until 1861. The Government of India (British Raj) then undertook the issue of banknotes in 1861, and that is when all Early, Private, and Presidency Banks‚Äô currency issues ceased. The Government of India issued banknotes in 1861 which were uniface with a portrait of Queen Victoria, and underprinting was introduced to the portrait in the series beginning 1867. Vignettes in the book include the history of Indian bank notes dating back to 1770, when the Bank of Hindostan, a private bank located in Calcutta issued its first banknotes. However, the earliest banknote to still survive is dated 1810, by the Bank of Bengal. The book includes a comprehensive listing of all Indian banknotes since 1770. Early on, all paper currency of India was printed by the Bank of England and shipped to India for distribution. The British India banknotes of King George V were also printed in England. In 1928, the India Security Press at Nasik became functional and took over from the Bank of England Press the printing of notes. In 1935, the Reserve Bank of India was established, and since then it has been the only currency-issuing authority and monetary agency for India. The King George VI Portrait Series were in circulation from 1936 till 1947. The series of King George V and King George VI were also overprinted for use in Burma. The overprinted banknotes of King George VI were also used in Pakistan until 1948. The book also deals with banknotes since Indian independence, up to the current series of banknotes with the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. These include the special-issue notes intended for use in the Persian Gulf for the Trucial States, as well as money used by the Hajj pilgrims. The Osmania banknotes of Hyderabad of 1919-1953 also form a part of this book. Also listed are the issue of banknotes by Jammu and Kashmir and the Hawala notes of Saurashtra. The scope of this book includes the issues of Indo-Portuguese notes for Goa and Indo-French territories at Pondicherry. The cash coupons of Indian Princely States that were printed on paper were issued to counteract the shortage of metal during World War II. The Prisoner of War coupons used as money by the interned prisoners of the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, World War II, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 are also illustrated. The book has an entire chapter on Essays, Patterns, Proofs and Trials, which displays many of the best Indian banknotes that were designed but never made it into circulation. The book illustrates the watermarks and explains the minute features of the notes in detail. ==Authors== The book has been primarily authored by Rezwan Razack, the joint managing director of Prestige Groups, in association with Kishore Jhunjhunwalla, the sole author of the original ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money‚Äô‚Äô. The authors of the book also acknowledged the roles of Rekha Chandrabhanu, Bazil Shaikh, Murali Thantry, Sanjay Mittal, Mahalingeshwar Athani and Amarbir Singh, an expert on the banknotes and coins of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Hyderabad notes are also known as Osmania Sicca notes.

He was educated at primary and junior schools in Blaenavon and at Jones' West Monmouth Grammar School, Pontypool, before reading Law at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took B.A., M.A. and LL.M. (International) degrees. He is a Titular Exhibitioner of Jesus College. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn as a Hardwick Entrance Scholar and was in 1984 awarded the Megarry Major Scholarship. ==Career History== Huckle was called to the Bar in 1985. In 2008 he was instrumental in establishing Civitas Law chambers as the first specialist civil law chambers in Wales. He was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) in 2011. With the agreement of the First Minister of Wales and the National Assembly for Wales Huckle continued in private practice as a QC during his appointment as Counsel General. In May 2015 he joined Doughty Street Chambers in London as a tenant whilst remaining a door tenant of Apex Chambers in Cardiff. In 2012 Huckle was elected a Master of the Bench (Bencher) of Lincoln's Inn. In 2016 Huckle became the General Editor of the Butterworths' Personal Injury Litigation Service. In the same year he became a Visiting Professor of Law the King's College, London. Huckle‚Äôs private practice profile includes complex clinical disputes and personal injury, including occupational illness/disease litigation, spinal, head injury and clinical negligence; public law, human rights and commercial matters including employment, fraud and professional negligence. Huckle is accredited as a mediator by ADR Group and QC Mediation, and as an arbitrator as a founder member of PIcARBS. Huckle appeared for the Claimant Miss Baker in the first case of industrial \\"deafness\\" (noise-induced hearing loss) to be considered in the Supreme Court (or its predecessor Judicial Committee of the House of Lords): Baker v Quantum Clothing [2011] UKSC 17; [2011] 1 WLR 1003; [2011] ICR 523; [2011] PIQR P14. He subsequently appeared in three UK constitutional references to the Supreme Court as Counsel General for Wales (see below), leading respectively Clive Lewis QC (now Lewis J), Elizabeth Laing QC (now Laing J) and Richard Gordon QC. ==Counsel General for Wales== Huckle was appointed Counsel General Designate by the First Minister on 27 May 2011. The National Assembly for Wales gave its approval on 8 June 2011 and the appointment as Counsel General was formally made by Her Majesty the Queen on Friday 10 June 2011.Biography on wales.gov.uk, official site of the Welsh Government The then Presiding Judge of the Wales Circuit, David Lloyd Jones J, undertook the swearing in ceremony on 13 June 2011. Though not a Minister of the Welsh Government, the Counsel General for Wales is a member of Government under s45 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, senior and authoritative legal advisor to the Government, and its representative in the courts. The Counsel General has certain functions to be exercised independent of the Government, including the ability to refer Bills of the National Assembly to the Supreme Court for a decision on their legislative (constitutional) competence, which power Huckle exercised on one occasion (see below). The office of Counsel General is at ministerial level and the Counsel General is bound by the Ministerial Code. The Counsel General may not be removed from the position except by resolution of the National Assembly for Wales itself. Huckle is the first and, to date, only person not an Assembly Member to hold the office of Counsel General to the Welsh Government as a member of the Government and the only practising lawyer to hold this office. There was considerable interest in his appointment from outside Cardiff Bay, which was widely seen as a reflection of the newly enhanced legislative powers of the National Assembly and a desire on the part of the First Minister to bring additional legal rigour to the development and passage of legislation by the Assembly. He attended Cabinet at the invitation of the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. Huckle left the role in May 2016, at the end of the term of the Third Assembly and upon the formation of a new Welsh Government. ==Work as Counsel General== Axa v Lord Advocate [2011] UKSC 46; [2011] 3 W.L.R. 871 In one of his first actions as Counsel General for Wales, Huckle appeared in the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in this case, which was an insurers' challenge to the validity of the Scottish Parliament‚Äôs Act which overturned the ruling in the Pleural Plaques cases (Rothwell etc.) and made pleural plaques a sufficient injury to attract compensation. There were a number of issues considered by the Supreme Court but of particular interest for the Welsh devolution settlement was the fact that the validity of the Scottish Act was questioned on common law grounds: it was argued by the appellants (insurance companies) that Acts of the Scottish Parliament are open to judicial review as an unreasonable, irrational and or arbitrary exercise of the legislative authority conferred by the Scotland Act 1998 on the Scottish Parliament. If that contention was held to be right, then Acts of the National Assembly for Wales would similarly be open to judicial review on these grounds. Accordingly, the First Minister of Wales intervened in the appeal in the Supreme Court in order to make representations on the scope of common law challenge so far as Acts of the Assembly were concerned. Huckle appeared before the Supreme Court to make oral representations on behalf of the Welsh Government. This was the first time that the Counsel General for Wales (in the Law Officer role created by the Government of Wales Act 2006) has appeared on behalf of the Welsh Government in the highest court in the land. Lord Hope warmly welcomed the Counsel General to the Supreme Court for the first time in his new office. Huckle argued that the National Assembly for Wales was a democratically elected legislature and that the limits of its powers were set out in the Government of Wales Act 2006 which expressly enables the Assembly to make laws in the same way that the Westminster Parliament makes laws, so that the laws of the Assembly are to be viewed as equivalent in status to those of Westminster provided the Assembly is otherwise acting within the scope of its devolved authority. The Courts could not therefore impose additional limitations that fell outside the scope of the Scotland Act 1998 and, by implication, also the Government of Wales Act 2006. In their judgment, the seven Supreme Court Justices unanimously agreed with the position of the Welsh Government .Their Lordships held that Acts of the Scottish Parliament could not be subject to judicial review at common law on the grounds of irrationality, unreasonableness or arbitrariness. Acts of the Scottish Parliament would only be open to challenge at common law on the grounds that they were not compatible with the rule of law or that they infringed fundamental rights. The Supreme Court confirmed that the same must apply equally to Acts of the National Assembly for Wales. Whilst the case focused on devolved legislation, some of their Lordships restated the possibility that even Acts of Parliament could be challenged where the legislation was such as to undermine the rule of law or fundamental rights (see Lord Steyn‚Äôs observations in Jackson v AG [2005] UKHL 56), although this remains formally undecided. Access to and rationalisation of Welsh Law In his first formal statement to the National Assembly for Wales on 4 October 2011, Huckle announced Welsh Government's project to ensure easy public access to the increasing statutory law emanating from the National Assembly, and a review of methods of rationalisation and consolidation of those laws with existing provisions of the law of England & Wales. Separate legal jurisdiction On 27 March 2012, Huckle launched a public debate on whether Wales should be a separate legal jurisdiction by making a formal statement to the National Assembly for Wales and issuing a Welsh Government Consultation. He leads for Welsh Government on this issue in order to promote and facilitate the public debate. Reference to the Supreme Court of the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill - Attorney General v National Assembly for Wales Commission [2012] UKSC 53; [2013] 1 A.C. 792; [2012] 3 W.L.R. 1294; [2013] 1 All E.R. 1013; Times, December 31, 2012 Huckle appeared for the Welsh Government before the UK Supreme Court in response to the first Reference of this type under s112 of the Government of Wales Act (\\"GOWA\\") 2006 by the Attorney General for England and Wales of the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill 20, the first of the new Welsh Acts to be passed by the National Assembly (unanimously). The Bill provided for a new mechanism for creation of byelaws but without ministerial approval either in Cardiff or, crucially to the Reference, in Westminster, thus repealing the previous confirmation power of a Minister of the Crown. The Justices unanimously agreed that the Bill was within the competence of the National Assembly because the removal of the Minister of the Crown's function was \\"incidental to or consequential on\\" the inception of the new system and the removal of the concurrent function of the Welsh Ministers. Reference to the Supreme Court of the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill - Attorney General for England and Wales v Counsel General for Wales [2014] UKSC 43; [2014] 1 W.L.R. 2622; [2014] 4 All E.R. 789; Times, July 14, 2014 The National Assembly passed this Bill to reinstate a form of Agricultural Wages Board (in an expanded functions form) after the abolition of the AWB across England & Wales by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, notwithstanding the provisions of the Public Bodies Act 2011 which provided for the abolition of such \\"quangos\\" but subject to the consent of devolved legislatures where their legislative competence was engaged. Agriculture is a devolved subject under GOWA 2006, but the coalition government in Westminster contended that abolition (and creation) of an agricultural wages board did not \\"relate to\\" agriculture at all so as to engage the Assembly's competence within ss107-8 of GOWA 2006, but rather to \\"employment\\" which, it contended, was not a devolved subject, notwithstanding that it is neither described in the competence provisions of Schedule 7 to GOWA 2006 as a subject nor as an express exception to devolved competence, nor in the separate express restrictions on competence. The treatment of employment or employment law rights is thus different in the Welsh settlement to that of the Scottish, where employment law and rights are matters reserved to UK Parliament by the provisions of the Scotland Acts. Huckle again appeared for the Welsh Government to argue that the Assembly does have competence to legislate with respect to employment rights and law provided that the provisions doing so also \\"relate to\\" a devolved subject, in this case agriculture. The Supreme Court agreed and the reference was rejected unanimously by the 5-Justice panel. Reference to the Supreme Court of the Recovery of Medical Costs for Asbestos Diseases (Wales) Bill [2015] UKSC 3; [2015] A.C. 1016; [2015] 2 W.L.R. 481; [2015] 2 All E.R. 899; [2015] H.R.L.R. 9; [2015] Lloyd's Rep. I.R. 474; (2015) 143 B.M.L.R. 1 Huckle referred this Bill for decision, to date the first and only exercise by a devolved law officer of the power to refer a Bill of the devolved legislature for decision. He appeared on the Reference which considered the competence of the National Assembly to pass a Bill providing for the recovery of medical costs from compensators in claims for asbestos injury in the way provided for in accident cases under the Social Security legislation. The insurers challenged the Assembly's legislative competence generally and for breach of ECHR Art 1 Protocol 1 because of the retroactive effect of the legislation upon liabilities under employer's liability insurance contracts entered into in some cases many years ago. The Supreme Court agreed 3-2 that the Assembly did not have competence to enact the Bill at all, as its provisions did not \\"relate to\\" the national health service in Wales (a devolved subject area), and that the recovery provisions did (in any event) offend against the insurers' accorded property rights. Powerful dissents from Lord Thomas CJ and Lady Hale held that the Assembly did have legislative competence generally in the area dealt with, but that Art 1 was indeed infringed by these provisions. The Bill accordingly fell. On the minority view it would likely have been possible to amend it in accordance with s114 of GOWA 2006 to make it Art 1 Protocol 1 complaint. ==Professional associations== Huckle is the Executive Committee Member for Wales of the Personal Injury Bar Association (\\"PIBA\\").

He wrote for the Daily Mail and also worked as a scriptwriter and a feature editor for the BBC. In 1951 Boshell left Fleet Street to join The World Health Organization as an information officer. During this time he worked in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, as well as in the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. Boshell returned to Britain in 1967 after which he and his wife lived in Wells, Somerset. Boshell's first published book was \\"My Pen My Sword\\" a collection of poetry originally published in the Daily Mail. The book was subtitled \\"Bee of the Daily Mail\\" which may have been Boshell's alias. Boshell then published two adult novels (\\"John Brown's Body\\", \\"Dog's Life\\"). His early works were influenced by the Second World War. For example, his poem \\"The Aeroplane\\"AllPoetry. Retrieved 30 March 2012 was written after watching the Battle of Britain dogfights from the streets of London. On returning to the UK Boshell began writing children's books, beginning with the \\"Captain Cobwebb\\" series for which he is best known., blog post, 25 July 2011. Retrieved 30 March 2012 He also wrote a trilogy of books known as \\"The Secret Guardians\\" series. Boshell co-created the \\"Garth\\" comic strip, Retrieved 30 March 2012, The story of science fiction in Britain, Retrieved 30 March 2012, Modern Prometheans & Night Terrors - Science Fiction TV Series In Britain and America, Retrieved 30 March 2012 with Steve Dowling. ==The Captain Cobwebb Series == The front cover art of the Armada Books paperback reprint of Captain Cobwebb and the Red Transistor illustrated by Graham Thompson The \\"Captain Cobwebb\\" books are a series of 11 children's novels written by Gordon Boshell between 1967-1980. The main characters in the book are David & Toby Green, two brothers who live in Dingle Down village, and their Uncle Septimus Cobwebb, aka \\"Captain Cobwebb\\". As a young man, Uncle Septimus decided to spend all night sitting in a fairy ring. As a result, he went off to live with the fairies, becoming invisible. The books usually begin with the boys getting bored, e.g. during a rainy day, or lying ill in bed, and then calling on their Uncle to send them on an adventure, usually in a far-off magical land. In the first book both the boys and their parents contact Uncle Septimus. They boys father tell them the story of his brother going off to live with the fairies and how to contact him. By writing a letter to their uncle, burning it to ash and then letting the ashes blow into the wind, they are able to send him a message. The adventure begins immediately. After their first adventure (\\"Captain Cobwebb\\") Uncle Septimus rewards the boys with a magical blue spot on their hand which they can touch to request an adventure. The boys' adventures take them to various magical lands and so the books have a number of different themes e.g. Pirates, Cowboys & Indians. As well as a typical range of heroic characters, and talking animals, the stories typically include a range of more unusual characters, creatures and situations. It is these odd quirks that make the books so memorable. Some examples of characters and creatures in the book include: * The Refined Gorilla‚Äîa talking Gorilla who escaped from London Zoo aided by an aging Admiral. After a career as a sailor the Gorilla becomes king of a city of monkeys * Captain Morgan‚Äîa vicious pirate with a razor sharp metal nose who tortures his captives by pecking them; the villain of \\"Captain Cobwebb\\" * The Puertl-Fowl‚Äîa bird that can only lay its eggs after dark, in the footprints of sailors * Fanty the Elephorse‚Äîa cross between a horse and an elephant * The Ugudugu-djuk‚Äîa subterranean hermit who digs his own tunnels underneath the desert * Hildrok the Outcast‚Äîpart human, part snake and part bird of prey; the villain of \\"Captain Cobwebb and the Red Transistor\\" * Wurgs‚Äîa kind of hovering flat-fish with tentacles, that live in caverns underneath the ground The books included a number of illustrations. The first two books were originally illustrated by the author, the third by Raymond Fishwick, and the rest by Trevor Stubley. The first five books had paperback reprints by Armada Books with new illustrations by Graham Thompson. Several of the stories included maps, e.g. of Dingle Down or treasure maps. These maps were drawn by Boshell himself. In total, Boshell wrote 11 books in the Captain Cobwebb series. # Captain Cobwebb # Captain Cobwebb's Cowboys # Captain Cobwebb's Cobra # Captain Cobwebb's Adventurers # Captain Cobwebb and the Red Transistor # Captain Cobwebb and the Crustaks # Captain Cobwebb and The Chinese Unicorn # Captain Cobwebb and the Mischief Man # Captain Cobwebb and the Quogs # Captain Cobwebb and The Magic Drops # Captain Cobwebb and the Amazing Cloud ==The Secret Guardians Series== Three non-Captain Cobwebb books published by Target. # The Black Mercedes # The Million Pound Ransom # The Mendip Money Makers ==Bibliography== *Boshell, Gordon; (1941) My Pen My Sword; Hodder and Stoughton *Boshell, Gordon; (1942) John Brown's Body; Secker and Warburg *Boshell, Gordon; (1945) Dog's Life: a satirical novel *Boshell, Gordon; (1967) Captain Cobwebb; Chatto & Windus, ; Armada, *Boshell, Gordon; (1969) Captain Cobwebb's Cowboys; Chatto & Windus, ; Armada, *Boshell, Gordon; (1971) Captain Cobwebb's Cobra; Chatto & Windus, ; Armada, *Boshell, Gordon; (1972) The Plot Against Buster the Dog *Boshell, Gordon; (1973) Captain Cobwebb's Adventurers; Macdonald, ; Armada, *Boshell, Gordon; (1974) Captain Cobwebb and the Red Transistor; Macdonald & Jane's, ; Armada, *Boshell, Gordon; (1974) The Black Mercedes; Tandem Publishing. *Boshell, Gordon; (1975) The Million Pound Ransom; UK Bailey Brothers & Swindon. *Boshell, Gordon; (1975) Captain Cobwebb and the Crustaks; Macdonald & Jane's, *Boshell, Gordon; (1975) The Boy from Black Marsh *Boshell, Gordon; (1976) Captain Cobwebb and The Chinese Unicorn; Macdonald & Jane's, *Boshell, Gordon; (1976) The Mendip Money Makers; Target; *Boshell, Gordon; (1977) Captain Cobwebb and the Mischief Man; Macdonald & Jane's, *Boshell, Gordon; (1978) Captain Cobwebb and the Quogs; Macdonald & Jane's, *Boshell, Gordon; (1979) Captain Cobwebb and The Magic Drops; Macdonald & Jane's, *Boshell, Gordon; (1980) Captain Cobwebb and the Amazing Cloud; Macdonald & Jane's, ==References *Short biography.

At the age of 14 she moved to Philippines with her mother's charitable work. *Charitable work Her mother Monica had a charitable foundation, Kapatiran Foundation, based in Manila to establish feeding centers and education programs for children in some of the poorest areas of the city. It was during visits to these centers with her mother and sister that Baby M felt she wanted to help in her own way. She decided her passion for singing was the best way she could help and started singing in the slums. This is where she was discovered by a Japanese producer. In 2000 she was dubbed \\"the bridge between Japan and the Philippines.\\" She also, through her mother, supported children with HIV in South Africa. *Music Career In 2000 Baby M released the independently produced It's Alright single to support the children in Muntinlupa City, a particularly deprived suburb of Metro Manila, Philippines. She officially debuted in 2002 as \\"Baby.M\\" under Universal Music Japan with the single Usual Girl, and after the release of two singles with the label, one indie mini-album. Having worked with various South African and Japanese singers and rappers, she re-debuted in 2009/2010 under Rhythm Zone, Avex, one of Japan's biggest labels. In 2011 she signed with Universal Records Philippines under a license from Avex. The \\"M\\" of her stage name makes reference to the three important \\"M's\\" of her life; Monica, her mother, Mary and Music. In 2011 she was nominated and became the Music Goodwill Ambassador for Japan to South Africa. ==Japanese discography== Albums * [2010.06.30] Baby M Japan * [2011.02.17] Baby M Philippines * [2012.03.28] Love for All Japan * [2016.8.31] Bhetnai garho bho......

This sort of function usually comes in linear regression, where the coefficients are called regression coefficients. However, they also occur in various types of linear classifiers (e.g. logistic regression, perceptronsRosenblatt, Frank (1957), The Perceptron--a perceiving and recognizing automaton. Report 85-460-1, Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory., support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis), as well as in various other models, such as principal component analysisJolliffe I.T. Principal Component Analysis, Series: Springer Series in Statistics, 2nd ed., Springer, NY, 2002, XXIX, 487 p. 28 illus. and factor analysis. In many of these models, the coefficients are referred to as \\"weights\\". == Definition == The basic form of a linear predictor function f(i) for data point i (consisting of p explanatory variables), for i = 1, ..., n, is : f(i) = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_p x_{ip}, where x_{ik}, for k = 1, ..., p, is the value of the k-th explanatory variable for data point i, and \\\\beta_0, \\\\ldots, \\\\beta_p are the coefficients (regression coefficients, weights, etc.) indicating the relative effect of a particular explanatory variable on the outcome.  Notations  It is common to write the predictor function in a more compact form as follows: *The coefficients Œ≤0, Œ≤1, ..., Œ≤p are grouped into a single vector Œ≤ of size p + 1\\\\. *For each data point i, an additional explanatory pseudo-variable xi0 is added, with a fixed value of 1, corresponding to the intercept coefficient Œ≤0. *The resulting explanatory variables xi0(= 1), xi1, ..., xip are then grouped into a single vector xi of size p + 1\\\\.  Vector Notation  This makes it possible to write the linear predictor function as follows: :f(i)= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_i using the notation for a dot product between two vectors.  Matrix Notation  An equivalent form using matrix notation is as follows: :f(i)= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm T}_i \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta where \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta and \\\\mathbf{x}_i are assumed to be a (p+1)-by-1 column vectors, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{\\\\mathrm T} is the matrix transpose of \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta (so \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{\\\\mathrm T} is a 1-by-(p+1) row vector), and \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf{x}_i indicates matrix multiplication between the 1-by-(p+1) row vector and the (p+1)-by-1 column vector, producing a 1-by-1 matrix that is taken to be a scalar. == Linear regression == An example of the usage of a linear predictor function is in linear regression, where each data point is associated with a continuous outcome yi, and the relationship written :y_i = f(i) + \\\\varepsilon_i = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\ + \\\\varepsilon_i, where \\\\varepsilon_i is a disturbance term or error variable ‚Äî an unobserved random variable that adds noise to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and predictor function. ==Stacking== In some models (standard linear regression, in particular), the equations for each of the data points i = 1, ..., n are stacked together and written in vector form as : \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon, \\\\, where : \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_n \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x}'_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}'_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}'_n \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & \\\\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{21} & \\\\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{n1} & \\\\cdots & x_{np} \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\beta_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_p \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_n \\\\end{pmatrix}. The matrix X is known as the design matrix and encodes all known information about the independent variables. The variables \\\\varepsilon_i are random variables, which in standard linear regression are distributed according to a standard normal distribution; they express the influence of any unknown factors on the outcome. This makes it possible to find optimal coefficients through the method of least squares using simple matrix operations. In particular, the optimal coefficients \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat\\\\beta} as estimated by least squares can be written as follows: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat\\\\beta} =( X^\\\\mathrm T X)^{-1}X^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\mathbf{y}. The matrix ( X^\\\\mathrm T X)^{-1}X^{\\\\mathrm T} is known as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of X. The use of the matrix inverse in this formula requires that X is of full rank, i.e. there is not perfect multicollinearity among different explanatory variables (i.e. no explanatory variable can be perfectly predicted from the others). In such cases, the singular value decomposition can be used to compute the pseudoinverse. ==The explanatory variables== Although the outcomes (dependent variables) to be predicted are assumed to be random variables, the explanatory variables themselves are usually not assumed to be random. Instead, they are assumed to be fixed values, and any random variables (e.g. the outcomes) are assumed to be conditional on them. As a result, the data analyst is free to transform the explanatory variables in arbitrary ways, including creating multiple copies of a given explanatory variable, each transformed using a different function. Other common techniques are to create new explanatory variables in the form of interaction variables by taking products of two (or sometimes more) existing explanatory variables. When a fixed set of nonlinear functions are used to transform the value(s) of a data point, these functions are known as basis functions. An example is polynomial regression, which uses a linear predictor function to fit an arbitrary degree polynomial relationship (up to a given order) between two sets of data points (i.e. a single real- valued explanatory variable and a related real-valued dependent variable), by adding multiple explanatory variables corresponding to various powers of the existing explanatory variable. Mathematically, the form looks like this: :y_i = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 x_i + \\\\beta_2 x_i^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_p x_i^p. In this case, for each data point i, a set of explanatory variables is created as follows: :(x_{i1} = x_i,\\\\quad x_{i2} = x_i^2,\\\\quad \\\\ldots,\\\\quad x_{ip} = x_i^p) and then standard linear regression is run. The basis functions in this example would be :\\\\boldsymbol\\\\phi(x) = (\\\\phi_1(x), \\\\phi_2(x), \\\\ldots, \\\\phi_p(x)) = (x, x^2, \\\\ldots, x^p). This example shows that a linear predictor function can actually be much more powerful than it first appears: It only really needs to be linear in the coefficients. All sorts of non-linear functions of the explanatory variables can be fit by the model. There is no particular need for the inputs to basis functions to be univariate or single- dimensional (or their outputs, for that matter, although in such a case, a K-dimensional output value is likely to be treated as K separate scalar-output basis functions). An example of this is radial basis functions (RBF's), which compute some transformed version of the distance to some fixed point: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x};\\\\mathbf{c}) = \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{c}) = \\\\phi(\\\\sqrt{(x_1 - c_1)^2 + \\\\ldots + (x_K - c_K)^2}) An example is the Gaussian RBF, which has the same functional form as the normal distribution: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x};\\\\mathbf{c}) = e^{-b\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{c}^2} which drops off rapidly as the distance from c increases. A possible usage of RBF's is to create one for every observed data point. This means that the result of an RBF applied to a new data point will be close to 0 unless the new point is near to the point around which the RBF was applied. That is, the application of the radial basis functions will pick out the nearest point, and its regression coefficient will dominate. The result will be a form of nearest neighbor interpolation, where predictions are made by simply using the prediction of the nearest observed data point, possibly interpolating between multiple nearby data points when they are all similar distances away. This type of nearest neighbor method for prediction is often considered diametrically opposed to the type of prediction used in standard linear regression: But in fact, the transformations that can be applied to the explanatory variables in a linear predictor function are so powerful that even the nearest neighbor method can be implemented as a type of linear regression. It is even possible to fit some functions that appear non-linear in the coefficients by transforming the coefficients into new coefficients that do appear linear. For example, a function of the form a + b^2x_{i1} + \\\\sqrt{c}x_{i2} for coefficients a,b,c could be transformed into the appropriate linear function by applying the substitutions b' = b^2, c' = \\\\sqrt{c}, leading to a + b'x_{i1} + c'x_{i2}, which is linear. Linear regression and similar techniques could be applied and will often still find the optimal coefficients, but their error estimates and such will be wrong. The explanatory variables may be of any type: real-valued, binary, categorical, etc. The main distinction is between continuous variables (e.g. income, age, blood pressure, etc.) and discrete variables (e.g. sex, race, political party, etc.). Discrete variables referring to more than two possible choices are typically coded using dummy variables (or indicator variables), i.e. separate explanatory variables taking the value 0 or 1 are created for each possible value of the discrete variable, with a 1 meaning \\"variable does have the given value\\" and a 0 meaning \\"variable does not have the given value\\". For example, a four-way discrete variable of blood type with the possible values \\"A, B, AB, O\\" would be converted to separate two-way dummy variables, \\"is-A, is-B, is-AB, is-O\\", where only one of them has the value 1 and all the rest have the value 0. This allows for separate regression coefficients to be matched for each possible value of the discrete variable. Note that, for K categories, not all K dummy variables are independent of each other. For example, in the above blood type example, only three of the four dummy variables are independent, in the sense that once the values of three of the variables are known, the fourth is automatically determined. Thus, it's really only necessary to encode three of the four possibilities as dummy variables, and in fact if all four possibilities are encoded, the overall model becomes non-identifiable. This causes problems for a number of methods, such as the simple closed-form solution used in linear regression. The solution is either to avoid such cases by eliminating one of the dummy variables, and/or introduce a regularization constraint (which necessitates a more powerful, typically iterative, method for finding the optimal coefficients). ==See also== *Linear model *Linear regression == References == Category:Regression analysis Category:Machine learning ","title":"Linear predictor function"},{"id":"35272271","text":"The Kurhaus (\\"cure house\\", ) is the spa house in Wiesbaden, the capital of Hesse, Germany. It serves as the city's convention centre, and the social center of the spa town. In addition to a large and a smaller hall, it houses a restaurant and the Wiesbaden Casino, or Spielbank, which is notable for allowing the \\"highest roulette stakes in Germany\\" (as of 2005), and where Fyodor Dostoyevsky was said to have received the inspiration for his novel The Gambler. ==Location== Wiesbaden's spielbank (casino) can be seen behind a fountain of the Bowling Green The Kurhaus Wiesbaden is in the centre of Wiesbaden, part of the Kureck (spa corner) at the end of the main street, Wilhelmstra√üe, with the town proper being situated on the other side of the Wilhelmstra√üe. Its main entrance, on the west side, faces the so-called Bowling Green, a grass-covered square with two fountains, so named by British spa guests. On the south side of the green is the Hessisches Staatstheater with the Theater colonnade and on the north the Kurhaus colonnade or fountain hall, with a length of , it is the longest columned hall in Europe. It houses the slot machines for the casino. In 2004‚Äì06, an underground parking garage was constructed under the square and the aging plane trees that had formerly stood along both sides were replaced by young trees of the same species. Behind the Kurhaus, the landscaped Kurpark extends eastward, with a band shell and a fountain pond. The park is cited as the most scenic in the city. ==History== The old Kurhaus, steel engraving by William Tombleson (1840) The old Kurhaus, 1900 Kurpark, 1900 Wiesbaden has a long history as a spa town. The Romans already knew of the thermal springs of Wiesbaden. The name of the city is derived from Wisibada, the bathing place in the meadows. In 1810, the first spa house was built by Christian Zais. This was a beautiful but relatively modest building with a columned portico, including Doric and Ionic features, in classical style. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe praised the building on one of his many visits. During the 19th century, the benefits of the spa attracted the upper classes. The number of spa visitors, 20,000 in 1840, had increased tenfold by 1910. A larger, more modern and more impressive spa house was thus required. In 1905‚Äì07, the old spa building was demolished, and in its place a new building, designed by architect Friedrich von Thiersch, was erected at a cost of six million gold marks. At the opening ceremony, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who visited the spa every year in May and had facilitated the rebuilding, called it \\"the most beautiful spa building in the world\\". The two concert halls in the building are named after the builders, the larger hall Friedrich von Thiersch Hall, and the smaller one Christian Zais Hall. Since 1949, the main portion of the Wiesbaden Casino has also been located in the building, in the former wine hall. During the 1980s, the Kurhaus underwent an extensive renovation, and was equipped with modern conference technology. ==Architecture and fittings== The Kurhaus Wiesbaden is constructed in neo- classical style with Art Nouveau elements; the facade is of Belle √âpoque style. Other exterior features are the Corinthian columns and the mythical griffins frieze. On the building's portal the words Aquis Mattiacis (\\"the waters of the Mattiaci\\") are inscribed, a tribute to the Germanic tribe that once inhabited the area. The building is divided into two equal-sized wings. In the south wing is the large central pillar-lined concert hall (Friedrich von Thiersch Hall), with a parquet floor and balcony. The concert and event hall has 1,350 seats and measures 40 √ó 18 √ó 17 m; it has excellent acoustics. At the front end of the south wing is the \\"Muschelsaal\\" (Shell Hall). Originally the South Reading Room, it was decorated with frescoes by the Art Nouveau painter Fritz Erler and by Alexander von Salzmann, and with pebbles and shells symbolizing water and earth. A number of smaller function rooms, named after Carl Schuricht, Carl von Ibell, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ferdinand Hey'l and the emperor, offer a variety of spaces for events. At the other end, facing the park, the south wing ends in a winter garden. The north wing houses the smaller ballroom (Christian Zais Hall), a restaurant, and the main portion of the Wiesbaden Casino, which offers roulette, blackjack, and poker. Between the north and south wings, the foyer, with the main entrance on the west side and the park entrance opposite, is topped by a dome 21 m high. In front of each of the four piers supporting the dome are larger-than-life-size copies of Greek statues of deities, surmounted by mosaic medallions with colourful depictions of scenes featuring Roman deities. In 1954, an organ was built by the Steinmeyer company of Oettingen, Bavaria. It replaced the 1907 Sauer organ that had been destroyed in World War II. The organ has 48 registers and 3,000 pipes. From 1987 to 2004 the organist of the Marktkirche, Hans Uwe Hielscher, also served as the spa organist; he was succeeded in 2004 by Thomas J. Frank. ==Events== Ball des Weines 2014 (Wine Ball) - Scenic design Foyer The spa hall has hosted many important national and international events such as concerts, balls and conferences.

He inherited Lippe in 1429, before his first birthday. He stood under the regency and guardianship of his uncle Otto. After Otto died in 1446, his great-uncle Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne, was appointed regent. Dietrich was represented in Lippe by his Amtmann, Johann M√∂llenbeck. In 1444, Bernard VII concluded a treaty with Duke Adolph I of Cleves-Mark, in which he ceded to Adolph a 50% share in the city of Lippstadt, which had been mortgaged to Cleves. At the same time, he joined an alliance, which made him a party in the so-called Feud of Soest against Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne. In 1447, Dietrich called in a Bohemian army, which devastated the county-side in Lippe and levelled the town of Blomberg to the ground. The Bohemians also besieged the cities of Lippstadt and Soest, but were unsuccessful. After the feud had been settled in 1449, Bernard took up residence at Blomberg Castle. In 1468, he moved to Detmold, which at the time was the smallest city in Lippe, with only 350 inhabitants. He expanded the Detmold Castle; an inscription in the old castle tower dated 1470 is a reminder of this. Bernard was involved in a large number of feuds against various enemies, with shifting alliances. In 1469, he supported Landgrave Louis II, Landgrave of Lower Hesse against his brother Henry III, Landgrave of Upper Hesse. On the other hand, in 1464, he supported his own brother, Prince-Bishop Simon III of Paderborn against Louis II of Lower Hesse when they fought the Hesse-Paderborn Feud about Calenberg Castle. == Marriage and issue == From his marriage to Anna, the daughter of Count Otto II of Holstein-Schauenburg, he had the following children: * Anna (b. ), married: *# Otto VI, Count of Hoya *# John II, Count of Nassau-Beilstein (d. 1513) * Margaret (b. ), married to John I, Count of Rietberg * Elisabeth (b. ), married: *# John II, Count of Spiegelberg *# Rudolf VII, Count of Diepholz * Ermengarda ( ‚Äì 24 August 1524), married Jobst I, Count of Hoya (1466‚Äì1507) * Simon V of Lippe (1471‚Äì1536), married: *# Walburga of Bronkhorst *# Magdalene of Mansfield-Mittelort * Bernard * Agnes == See also == * List of longest- reigning monarchs == References == * Philippine Charlotte Auguste Piderit: Die lippischen Edelherrn im Mittelalter, Detmold, 1876, p. 100 ff, Online * * == External links == * Genealogy of Bernard VII Category:Lords of Lippe Category:House of Lippe Category:1428 births Category:1511 deaths Category:15th-century German people Category:15th-century rulers in Europe ","title":"Bernard VII, Lord of Lippe"},{"id":"35272321","text":"William Banks (1636 ‚Äì 6 July 1676) of Winstanley Hall, Wigan was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons twice between 1660 and 1676.

Rhombic chess is a chess variant for two players created by Tony Paletta in 1980.Pritchard (1994), p. 255 The gameboard has an overall hexagonal shape and comprises 72 rhombi in three alternating colors. Each player commands a full set of standard chess pieces. The game was first published in Chess Spectrum Newsletter 2 by the inventor.

Piece moves are described using two basic types of movement: * Edgewise‚Äîthrough the common side of adjoining cells. If an edgewise move is more than one step, it continues in a straight line from the side of a cell through its opposite side, the line being orthogonal to these sides. * Pointwise‚Äîthrough the sharpest corner of a cell, in a straight line to the next cell. (The paths are highlighted on the board by same-colored cells.) Piece moves * A rook moves edgewise only. * A bishop moves pointwise. It can also move one step edgewise. * The queen moves as a rook and bishop. * The king moves one step edgewise or pointwise. There is no castling in rhombic chess. * A knight moves in the pattern: one step edgewise followed by one step pointwise (or vice versa), away from its starting cell. Like a standard chess knight, it leaps any intervening men. * A pawn moves forward one step edgewise, with the option of two steps on its first move. A pawn captures the same as it moves.

His name comes from the Javanese word saka or soko meaning essential, important, or in this case primordial. Thus the name Aji Saka literally means \\"primordial king.\\" A more modern interpretation derives his name from the Saka or Indo-Scythian Western Satraps of Gujarat.Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992 p.131 In either case, the legend is viewed as symbolizing the advent of Dharmic Hindu-Buddhist civilization in Java. The legend also holds that Aji Saka was the inventor of the Saka year, or at least the first king that initiated the adoption of this Hindu calendar system in Java. The kingdom of Medang Kamulan was probably linked to the historical Medang Kingdom. The story of Aji Saka defeating a man-eating king has also been interpreted as the downfall of an unpopular local ruler, the rise from cannibalism to civilization, and perhaps also resistance to Indian faiths by the ruling class. ==Summary== The pacification of Java Soon after the gods created and nailed the island of Java to its place, the island became habitable. However, the first race that ruled the island was the race of denawa (giant demons) that repressed all creatures and ate humans. The first kingdom in Java was Medang Kamulan, and the king was the Giant King Dewata Cengkar, the cruel King of the country who had a habit of eating the human flesh of his own people. One day came a young wise man, by the name of Aji Saka, to fight Dewata Cengkar. Aji Saka himself came from Bumi Majeti. One day he told his two servants, by the name of Dora and Sembodo, that he was going to Java. He told them that while he was away, both of them had to guard his Pusaka (heirloom). No one except Aji Saka himself was allowed to take the Pusaka. After arriving in Java, Aji Saka moved inland to the kingdom of Medang Kamulan. In the big battle, Aji Saka was able to push Dewata Cengkar to fall into the Javan Southern Sea (Indian Ocean). Dewata Cengkar did not die; he became a Bajul Putih (White Crocodile). Aji Saka became a ruler of Medang Kamulan. The tale of a giant snake Meanwhile, a woman from the village of Dadapan found an egg. She put the egg in her lumbung (rice barn). After a certain period the egg vanished, and instead a snake was found in the rice barn. The villagers wanted to kill the snake, but the snake said: \\"I'm the son of Aji Saka, bring me to him.\\" Aji Saka told the snake that he would be recognized as his son if he could kill the Bajul Putih in the South Sea. After a long stormy battle in which both sides demonstrated physical strength and showed skillful fighting ability, the snake was able to kill Bajul Putih. As had been promised, the snake was recognized as Aji Saka's son and he was given a name, Jaka Linglung (a stupid boy). In the palace Jaka Linglung greedily ate domestic pets of the palace. He was punished by the King, expelling him to live in the Jungle of Pesanga. He was tightly roped until he could not move his head. He was instructed only to eat things which fell to his mouth. One day, a group of nine village boys were playing around in that Jungle. Suddenly it was raining heavily. They had to find a shelter; luckily there was a cave. Only eight boys went inside the cave; the other one was suffering from a very bad skin disease, his skin was stinging and he was dirty, and he had to stay out of the cave. All of a sudden, the cave fell apart. The eight boys vanished, only the one who stayed outside was safe. The cave in fact was the mouth of Jaka Linglung. The origin of Javanese script Meanwhile, after becoming ruler of the Medang Kamulan kingdom, Aji Saka sent a messenger back home to inform his faithful servants Dora and Sembodo, to bring the pusoko (heirloom) to Java and send them to Aji Saka. Then Dora came to Sembodo and told Aji Saka's order. Sembodo refused since he clearly remembered Aji Saka's previous order: no one except Aji Saka himself was allowed to take the pusoko. Dora and Sembodo each felt suspicious towards another, and suspecting each other tried to steal the pusoko. So they fought each other to death. Aji Saka was curious about why it was taking so long for the two to come to Java; he finally came home himself, only to discover the body of his two faithful servants and the terrible misunderstanding between them. To remember the faithful acts of his two servants, Aji Saka composed a poem that later become the origin of hanacaraka Javanese script. The Javanese alphabet itself forms a poem, and a perfect pangram, of which the line-by-line translation is as follows.:Soemarmo, Marmo. \\"Javanese Script.\\" Ohio Working Papers in Linguistics and Language Teaching 14.Winter (1995): 69-103.

Valmiki's Ramayana, made around 500 BC, records that Java already had a governmental organization long before the story: > \\"Yawadwipa is decorated with seven kingdoms, gold and silver islands, rich > in gold mines, and there is Cicira (cold) Mountain that touches the sky with > its peak.\\" According to Chinese records, the Javanese kingdom was founded in 65 BC, or 143 years before the story of Aji Saka began.W.P Groeneveldt (1880). Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca Compiled from Chinese Sources. Batavia. The story of Saka or Aji Saka is a Neo Javanese story. This story has not yet been found to be relevant in the Old Javanese text. This story tells of events in the Medang Kamulan kingdom in Java in the past. At that time, the king of Medang Kamulan Prabu Dewata Cengkar was replaced by Aji Saka. This story is considered as an allegory of the entry of Indians into Java. Referring to the Liang dynasty information, the Javanese kingdom was divided into two: the pre- Hinduism kingdom and the post-Hindu kingdom, which began in 78 AD. ==See also== *Tantu Pagelaran *Wawacan Sulanjana ==References== Category:Javanese folklore mythology ","title":"Aji Saka"},{"id":"35272366","text":"The Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra is a Roman Catholic church in Bandra, Mumbai. It was built in 1894 by Jesuit Missionaries. As the catholic population in Bandra increased in the latter half of the 20th century, a new modern structure was constructed in its place. The new church was blessed and inaugurated on 11 February 1981 by Archbishop Simon Pimenta, Archbishop of Bombay. ==History== The authorities of St Andrew Church and Mount Mary Chapel in Bandra provided land for the erection of the church in 1894 to cater to the 215 families living in the present Chapel Road and Bazaar Road areas that were separated in 1891 from the St Peter Church (then under the Propaganda Jurisdiction) with the permission of the Holy See (Rome). The church was built on the banks of the Mahim creek opposite the ‚ÄòCustoms House‚Äô which still exists today in front of the church, although the creek was reclaimed to form the current Bandra Reclamation locality. The foundation stone was laid on 7 February 1892 by Antonio Pedro Da Costa, Bishop Of Daman, who also blessed the completed church on 1 June 1894. Fr Pio Ellias Saldanha was the first Parish Priest of the church. The need for a new and larger church was felt in the 1960s as more Catholics had moved into the area and in 1975 Cardinal Valerian Gracias, Archbishop of Bombay, laid the foundation stone of the new church building. ==Structure== Original church The main altar of the original church was obtained from one of the ancient, ruined churches of Diu. The original parishioners who were fisher folk contributed towards the building of the church, transporting stones and other construction materials in their fishing boats to the building site. The new church The new church was constructed in keeping with the post‚Äìconciliar spirit of the Second Vatican Council. For example, the sanctuary is not separated from the body of the church by communion rails, which was a feature in older churches. It is characterized by an absence of clutter and is well-ventilated. The rough and rustic stone backdrop of the sanctuary provides a background for the large cross and crucifix which has been carved from a single tree. The altar table and lectern have a geometrical design with slender proportions, constructed of black and ruby- red granite. the top of the altar is a single block of granite. There is no statue in the sanctuary apart from the large crucifix and there are relatively few other statues in the church. The cantilevered canopy at the entrance of the church is designed to symbolize two hands joined in prayer, with a cross in the centre. The church's large windows that provide cross ventilation have vertical R.C.C. fins between them that act as sun- breakers, giving the church exterior a unique appearance. The architect of the new church was a parishioner, Charles F.

Participants in the debate brought up multiple perspectives, including axioms of arithmetic, pedagogy, learning and instructional design, history of mathematics, philosophy of mathematics, and computer-based mathematics. ==Background of the debate== In the early 1990s Leslie Steffe proposed the counting scheme children use to assimilate multiplication into their mathematical knowledge. Jere Confrey contrasted the counting scheme with the splitting conjecture. Confrey suggested that counting and splitting are two separate, independent cognitive primitives. This sparked academic discussions in the form of conference presentations, articles and book chapters. The debate originated with the wider spread of curricula that emphasized scaling, zooming, folding and measuring mathematical tasks in the early years. Such tasks both require and support models of multiplication that are not based on counting or repeated addition. Debates around the question, \\"Is multiplication really repeated addition?\\" appeared on parent and teacher discussion forums in the mid-1990s. Keith Devlin wrote a Mathematical Association of America column titled, \\"It Ain't No Repeated Addition\\" that followed up on his email exchanges with teachers, after he mentioned the topic briefly in an earlier article. The column linked the academic debates with practitioner debates. It sparked multiple discussions in research and practitioner blogs and forums. Keith Devlin has continued to write on this topic. ==Pedagogical perspectives== From counting to multiplication In typical mathematics curricula and standards, such as the Common Core State Standards Initiative, the meaning of the product of real numbers steps through a series of notions generally beginning with repeated addition and ultimately residing in scaling. Once the natural (or whole) numbers have been defined and understood as a means to count, a child is introduced to the basic operations of arithmetic, in this order: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These operations, although introduced at a very early stage of a child's mathematics education, have a lasting impact on the development of number sense in students as advanced numeric abilities. In these curricula, multiplication is introduced immediately after posing questions related to repeated addition, such as: \\"There are 3 bags of 8 apples each. How many apples are there in all? A student can do: : 8 + 8 + 8 = 24, or choose the alternative : 3 \\\\times 8 = 24. This approach is supported for several years of teaching and learning, and sets up the perception that multiplication is just a more efficient way of adding. Once 0 is brought in, it affects no significant change because : 3 \\\\times 0 = 0 + 0 + 0, which is 0, and the commutative property would lead us also to define : 0 \\\\times 3 = 0. Thus, repeated addition extends to the whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The first challenge to the belief that multiplication is repeated addition appears when students start working with fractions. From the mathematical point of view, multiplication as repeated addition can be extended into fractions. For example, : 7/4 \\\\times 5/6 literally calls for ‚Äúone and three-fourths of the five-sixths.‚Äù This is later significant because students are taught that, in word problems, the word ‚Äúof‚Äù usually indicates a multiplication. However, this extension is problematic for many students, who start struggling with mathematics when fractions are introduced . Moreover, the repeated addition model must be substantially modified when irrational numbers are brought into play. Concerning these issues, mathematics educators have debated whether student difficulties with fractions and irrational numbers are exacerbated by viewing multiplication as repeated addition for a long time before these numbers are introduced, and relatedly whether it is acceptable to significantly modify rigorous mathematics for elementary education, leading children to believe statements that later turn out to be incorrect. From scaling to multiplication Multiplication can also be thought of as scaling. In the above animation, we see 3 being multiplied by 2, giving 6 as a result. One theory of learning multiplication derives from the work of the Russian mathematics educators in the Vygotsky Circle which was active in the Soviet Union between the world wars. Their contribution is known as the splitting conjecture. Another theory of learning multiplication derives from those studying embodied cognition, which examined the underlying metaphors for multiplication. Together these investigations have inspired curricula with \\"inherently multiplicative\\" tasks for young children. Examples of these tasks include: elastic stretching, zoom, folding, projecting shadows, or dropping shadows. These tasks don't depend on counting, and cannot be easily conceptualized in terms of repeated addition. Issues of debate related to these curricula include: What can be multiplied? Multiplication is often defined for natural numbers, then extended to whole numbers, fractions, and irrational numbers. However, abstract algebra has a more general definition of multiplication as a binary operation on some objects that may or may not be numbers. Notably, one can multiply complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and quaternions. Some educators believe that seeing multiplication exclusively as repeated addition during elementary education can interfere with later understanding of these aspects of multiplication. ==Models and metaphors that ground multiplication== In the context of mathematics education, models are concrete representations of abstract mathematical ideas that reflect some, or all, essential qualities of the idea. Models are often developed as physical or virtual manipulatives and curricular materials that accompany them. A part of the debate about multiplication and repeated addition is the comparison of different models and their curricular materials. Different models may or may not support multiplication of different types of numbers; for instance the set model in which numbers are presented as collections of objects, and multiplication as the union of multiple sets with the same number of objects in each, cannot be extended to multiplication of fractional or real numbers. Different models may also be relevant to specific applications of arithmetic; for example, combination models come up in probability and biology. == References == Category:Mathematics education ","title":"Multiplication and repeated addition"},{"id":"35272443","text":"Eden Rugby Club (formally known as Eden Rugby Football Club) is a rugby union club based in Auckland, New Zealand.

Uncertainty is the primary kaleidic factor.Katzner (1998) p. 258 ==Uncertainty in economics== British economist George Lennox Sharman Shackle, who has been characterised as a post-Keynesian but also as influenced by Austrian economics, made an attempt to challenge classical rational choice theory. He used the term \\"kaleidostatics\\" (or \\"kaleido-statics\\"), derived from \\"kaleidoscope\\", to describe the status of the economy in the particular posture which prevails at any point in time, a status due to \\"particular expectations, or rather, particular agreed formulas about the future, [as] are for the moment widely accepted.\\" This status, however, as Shackle continues in defining the term, \\"can change as swiftly, as completely, and on as slight a provocation as the loose, ephemeral mosaic of the kaleidoscope. A twist of the hand, a piece of 'news', can shatter one picture and replace it with a different one.\\"Shackle (1965), p. 48 A status, therefore, that is anything but stable. German economist Ludwig Lachmann, an important contributor to the Austrian School stated, in agreement with Shackle, that the magnitude of profits in an economy, in each period, is shaped mainly by \\"short-period forces.\\" Lachmann wrote that \\"a long-run force\\" is at work, all the time, tending to eliminate these price/cost differences and asserted that \\"in a long-run equilibrium, in which, by definition, the equilibrating forces have finally prevailed over all the forces of disruption, there are no profits.\\"Lachmann (1973) p. 32 The persistence of profits in a market economy, Lachmann's argument went, is due to the persistence of disequilibrium in some sector of the economic system; \\"As in a kaleidoscope, the constellation of forces operating in the system as a whole is ever changing.\\" And, Lachmann concluded, it is \\"kaleido-statics rather than static equilibrium\\" the method of analysis that is most appropriate to \\"the reality of the market economy.\\" This led Lachmann to assert that an \\"equilibrium rate of profit is...a contradiction in terms.\\" Critics of the notion of \\"kaleidics\\" view it as eliminating the prospect of advancing a claim about an objective reality, and to be replacing such claims with statements that are the private property of the observer. ==Keynesian kaleidics== John Maynard Keynes insisted upon dividing the total demand for money into several separate demands, each identified with some specific purpose. In the 1937 article, titled \\"The General Theory of Employment\\", in which he elaborates on his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes asserts, in effect, that the demand for money in the present derives from the uncertainty of our knowledge about the future - and that the fact that human knowledge of the future is \\"fluctuating, vague and uncertain, renders wealth a peculiarly unsuitable subject for the methods of the classical economic theory.\\" The kind of uncertainty that Keynes is referring to is the same kind that Lachmann associates with radical subjectivism. In fact, according to Keynes, \\"We simply do not know.\\"Lachmann (1986) p. 99 This sentiment is echoed in Shackle's subsequent, firm assertion, on the same premise, that \\"economics isn't a science, and we ought not to call it a science.\\"Shackle (1983) Shackle, in fact, was quite clear that \\"there is pretty complete in-determinacy\\" in our view towards the future. He stated, \\"I did spend a lot of energy trying to see if I could devise any theory of how expectations are formed and I ended with the conclusion that expectations are far too elusive and subtle to find out any principles or rules to explain their emergence.\\" This agrees with what Keynes had written earlier, in his 1937 article, about us having, as a rule, \\"only the vaguest idea of any but the most direct consequences of our acts.\\" ==Viennese kaleidics== Richard E. Wagner, going beyond the \\"idea of a kaleidic economy or society\\" that is \\"strongly associated with George Shackle and his vision of Keynesian kaleidics\\", asserted that \\"the central thrust of the Austrian tradition in economic analysis can be described by the term 'Viennese kaleidics'.\\"Wagner (2011) Wagner argues that, in either version of kaleidics, the analytical stress is placed on treating time seriously and not just notionally, which, Wagner claimed, \\"leads in turn to recognition that economic processes are better treated as turbulent than as equilibrated.\\" Although Wagner recognized that turbulence is a natural feature of the unavoidable incompleteness of intertemporal coordination, he submits that it is subject to mitigation and concludes that \\"individual liberty and private ordering [are] generally superior to state policy and public ordering in calming the turbulence that naturally characterizes a kaleidic society.\\" According to Wagner, the Walrasian idea of an orderly system of relationships has pervaded the corpus of Austrian theory and Ludwig von Mises‚Äô (1966) formulation of an evenly rotating economy gives recognition to this systemic quality. Moreover, as Wagner also points out, Friedrich Hayek‚Äôs (1932) treatment of the business cycle as departing from a position of Walrasian equilibrium is a similar effort. ==Keynesians vs Austrians== Notable Austrians consider the notion of kaleidics, as proposed by Shackle and Lachmann, who were considered as adherents, in general, to be \\"an alien injection into [the Austrian tradition], an approach that only offers \\"corruption of hard-gained truths.\\" The Austrian criticism reflects the belief that a kaleidic vision is contrary to the effort to uncover and articulate \\"objective claims about reality,\\" and essentially promotes a nihilist point of view, \\"where analysts are free to see what they choose to see.\\" In this respect, Murray Rothbard titled one essay \\"The Hermeneutical Invasion of Philosophy and Economics\\" (1990), and Joseph Salerno, in his treatment of what he regards as Lachmann‚Äôs nihilism, reports that Rothbard referred to \\"a disease\\" that has been infecting Austrian seminar rooms called ‚ÄúLachmannia‚Äù. Leland Yeager, in the same vein, counseled Austrian theorists not to be scornful of theories of general equilibrium. In contrast to the Austrian critics who perceived kaleidics as nihilistic, Stephen Parsons Parsons (1993) argued that it is orthodox economics, instead, with \\"its readiness to embrace fictive models that give definitive answers to questions, that is nihilistic,\\" while Warren Samuels Samuels (1993) asserted that \\"if the charge of nihilism is applied to any system of thought that leaves the future open, nihilism is superior to the alternative.\\" ==Current expectations== Austrian-school American economist Roger Garrison accepts that \\"expectations are not rational in the strong sense of that term\\", but claims that they become more rational \\"with increased levels of policy activism and with cumulative experience with the consequences of it.\\" Garrison characterizes expectations as adaptive, though he clarifies that they adapt \\"not just to changes in some particular price, wage rate, or interest rate, but also to the changing level of understanding that corresponds to the overlap\\"Garrison (1997) between local knowledge of conditions in some particular market and global knowledge of theories about how markets work, including those held by the regulator. ==See also== *Uncertainty *Ergodicity *Determinism *Chaos theory *Animal spirits ==NotesBibliography== *Garrison, Roger: **\\"The kaleidic world of Ludwig Lachmann: Review of The Market as an Economic Process\\", in Critical Review, vol. 1, issue #3 (Summer), 1987, pp. 77‚Äì89 **\\"An Agenda for Macroeconomics\\" in South African Journal of Economics, vol. 65, #4, December 1997, pp. 459‚Äì481 *Katzner, Donald W., UMassAmherst: Time, ignorance, and uncertainty in economic models, University of Michigan Press, 1998, , pp. 486 *Lachmann, L.

As a child, known then as Aquah LaLuah, she did not like textbooks or arithmetic but was a voracious reader, devouring Charles Kingsley's Heroes from cover to cover at the age of seven. She could sing, dance, and write poetry at an early age. Due to her upbringing she could speak fluent English, Creole, and Fante (the language of her father). She had her primary and secondary school education in Gold Coast and went to Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay, in Wales, after turning down two other competitive colleges that wanted her for her talented writing. Gladys stopped her education there and travelled with a Berlin jazz band as a dancer. She stayed with them for a long time, but started having breakdowns in 1932 and had to go home. Back home in Africa, she taught at her mother's Girls' Vocational School in Freetown, Sierra Leone. ==Later life and work== Acquah Laluah then married Arthur Hunter. At the school she taught African Folklore and Literature. She lectured extensively, frequently highlighting that native Africans are not inferior to any race. She was bold in declaring this because she has been privileged to live among the Caucasians. Those messages of racial equality found their way into her poetry writings. She had very deep African roots in her poetry and anthologists of the Harlem renaissance loved her work. Hayford was very energetic and free in herself as well as in her writing. Gladys May used her energy and kindness to make better poetry. She used her self-expression to make a change in the world through her writing. Gladys May was not part of the talented tenth, but she did write about subjects that were more controversial at the time. Many of her poems emphasise women's freedom and pride and others reflected her life. She created many inspiring and great writings; Her first poems were published in The Atlantic Monthly and The Philadelphia Tribune. Her poems, such as \\"Nativity\\" (1927), \\"The Serving Girl\\" (1941) and \\"Creation\\" (1926), have been widely anthologized. ==Death== Gladys May Casely-Hayford lived in Freetown, Sierra Leone, for much of her life.

It is multi-stepped, and is related to various compulsory rituals and traditions. Ancient Azerbaijani weddings reflect cycles of traditions, lasting for a long period of time, and need significant material costs. ==Structure of the ceremony== A formal wedding procedure begins with acceptance of consent of the bride's parents (‚Äús√∂z k…ôsm…ôk‚Äù) and continues after an independent decision about the marriage is made. Qiz G√∂rm…ô (presentation of a marriageable girl)  Such traditions as qƒ±z g√∂rm…ô (presentation of a marriageable girl) and qƒ±z b…ôy…ônm…ô (approval of the choice) are the first conditions of the wedding. Nearest relatives of the groom, who are gathered together to marry him, begin gathering information about the bride, her parents, and the family where she lives.Usually wine drinking is a part of this step with the family, to form a bond.  El√ßilik (Matchmaking) Azerbaijan national wedding costume in Azerbaijan State Museum of History. The day for sending matchmakers to the bride's house is fixed when the groom's choice is approved. More respected, elder relatives of the groom take part in the ‚Äúmain‚Äù matchmaking ceremony. Being refused is considered a blow to the prestige of the matchmakers. Generally, elder relatives of the groom or his elder sister are sent to the bride's house to obtain acceptance of preliminary consent. Earlier, the tradition required repeated ‚Äúrefusals‚Äù for a variety of reasons, but later this was considerably simplified. This simplification could be attributed to the belief that a future companion in life should be equal in rights and that youngsters have a right to make this private choice. In fixing the day of matchmaking everybody tries to choose the successful day, which should be a day when all dreams come true. According to an ancient belief, evil spirits bordered the matchmakers‚Äô path on the way to the bride's house, attempted to restrict the commitment, and wanted the matchmaker to receive a refusal and have to return without consent. To counteract this, people attached a pin to doors and walls of the house, which they approach. Evil spirits, frightened from the pin made of iron, did not have enough courage to leave the home and accompany the matchmaker going to the bride's house. Matchmaking is an indispensable tradition even when the couple agrees to the match. Ba≈ülƒ±ƒü (Payment) Azerbaijan honored the tradition of payment of ‚ÄúBa≈ülƒ±ƒü‚Äù. Ba≈ülƒ±ƒü is payment for the bride made by the groom's side to the bride's parents, specifically, to her father or another person who offers the bride for marriage. Payment was made in cash, cattle, or other material wealth before the wedding. This tradition is observed in Iranian Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan Republic. It was banned in Azerbaijan Republic during Soviet era. Ni≈üan (Engagement) or Adax (Betrothal) Engagement √ºz√ºk taxmaq process in Azerbaijan Throwing a red scarf round a bride's shoulders is an attribute of engagement in Azerbaijan Matchmaking follows engagement traditions. After the father decides to give his daughter for marriage, the groom entertains his new relatives with tea and sweeties in the bride's house. In 1908, the engagement process of Shahsevens, an ethnic group of Azerbaijanis, was described as follows: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  width=\\"50%\\" f6f6f6;\\"  Shahsevens enter into marriage according to ancient traditions. If the girl‚Äôs father agrees to marry his daughter off, then first of all the groom should entertain and sweeties to his new relatives in the bride‚Äôs house, which is called the tradition. } The period after the engagement and before the wedding is the main period in the life of a young couple. Earlier the length of this stage was very significant, sometimes extending several years. It could be that the long span of the engagement was related to difficulties relating to material welfare and the necessities of preparing for the future wedding ceremonies. Later this period was significantly shortened. C…ôhiz (dowry) After engagement or betrothal, the bride's family begins to prepare cehiz for their daughter's future family life. Cehiz is be in the form of all the needed equipment to fill the house. Usually groom's family buys the house and bride's family buys all the furnitures, kitchen equipments, washing machine, vacuum cleaner and many other things needed to live inside the house. It is glorious to the bride's family to provide wealth cehiz. This is accepted as the last duty of the parents for their daughter's life. K…ôbin (Religious registration) Registration of the marriage at mullah. Molla Nasraddin magazine (in Azeri), published between 1906-1931. Oscar Schmerling Religious registration of the marriage () is held several days before the wedding with the participation of witnesses from both sides. A guaranteed sum (‚Äúmehr‚Äù) is written into the marriage contract (‚Äúkebin kagizi‚Äù) (). This is a guaranteed amount of money for the bride in case of divorce or death of the husband. The amount was carefully kept by a married woman in the past. Toy (Wedding) Azim Azimzade. \\"Wedding of the poor people\\". 1931 A ceremony for decorating the house (‚Äúev bezemek‚Äù) is held a few days before the wedding. The ceremony concludes that same day when the dowry is brought to the groom's house. The aim of this tradition is to provide the young couple with all necessities in the beginning of their life together, which is why the dowry includes furniture, dishes and articles of domestic utility. A ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs wedding‚Äù (‚Äúpaltar kesdi‚Äù ceremony) and so called ‚Äúboy‚Äôs wedding‚Äù are distinguished. The national music sounds in the wedding.  Xƒ±nayaxdƒ± (Henna Night) A ceremony of ‚Äúhenna smearing‚Äù is held on the evening of the first day of the wedding at the bride's house. The bride's nearest female friends and relatives are invited to this event. A group of young boys and girls with musicians come from the groom's house. The nearest relatives of the groom smear henna on the bride's fingers and give gifts. The bride's family gives a formal dinner party to participants in the ceremony. The ‚Äúhenna smearing‚Äù has different names in different districts of Azerbaijan: in Shaki the ceremony is called ‚Äúthe bride‚Äôs feast‚Äù; in Tovuz the ceremony is the ‚Äúdemonstration of the girl‚Äù; in Masalli and Lenkeran the events are known as ‚Äúgathering at the girl‚Äôs‚Äù; in Guba the reference is ‚Äúhenna smearing‚Äù and in Absheron this is the ‚Äúhennanane‚Äù. According to tradition, on the night of ‚Äúhenna smearing‚Äù, the groom came to the bride's house for ‚Äútoy payi‚Äù (wedding portion) and took sheep and a hen, giving gifts and money in return. According to the tradition, it is appropriate to steal ‚Äútoy payi‚Äù, but in the 1980s the wedding portion was prepared in advance and given to the groom. Sometimes the musicians stay in the bride's house and merry-making and dancing continue until the morning. Registration of the marriage at mullah. Molla Nasraddin magazine. \\"Respect to the new bride\\". Oscar Schmerling On the second day of the wedding dances are held in the groom's house. Holding a ‚Äúgulesh‚Äù (wrestling show) was part of the second day in some villages until now. As far back as the 1970s, this tradition existed in every village of Azerbaijan. Famous wrestlers gathered together to weight their power in the wedding. At the end of the wedding a caravan is sent to the bride's house (nowadays-a car) to bring the bride to the groom's house (‚Äúgelin getirme‚Äù). On the way, boys detain the groom and bride and their caravan in order to receive a gift (‚Äúxelet‚Äù). Both palms of the bride are tied with a white or red handkerchief under which they put money, which was taken by the groom and bride's yenge. The bride's hands are untied before the wedding night. Uz…ô √áƒ±xdƒ± (After the wedding) A ceremony called ‚Äúuze √ßƒ±xdƒ±‚Äù, symbolizing the end of ‚Äúabsence‚Äù period, is held a few days after the wedding. In the past, according to the tradition, the bride didn't overstep the limits of a yard room for a month after the wedding. She didn't speak to her mother-in-law and father-in-law for a week. After the ‚Äúuze chixdi‚Äù ceremony the nearest relatives of the bride (except mother and father) and the groom get together in his house, greet the newlyweds, and present them with valuable gifts or money. ==Changes in the wedding ceremony== Despite the longstanding traditions, Azerbaijan weddings have undergone significant changes during the last decades. It is now widely accepted to take photos of a young couple on the wedding day and for a bride to wear a white wedding dress. The strict concealment of a young couple before the wedding has softened. Groom, or rarely a bride, can sit at a table with guests. In recent years, grooms were given the right to participate in the engagement ceremony. These changes are notably present in city weddings. It is expected that changes will continue in village weddings in coming years. One of the modern trends is the refusal of ‚Äúthe wedding without newlyweds‚Äù, a tradition of hiding the bride before the wedding. The length of the marriage celebration has also been shortened. Formerly a wedding could last for 3 or 7 days but now it lasts for a day. ==References== Azerb Category:Azerbaijani culture ","title":"Wedding tradition in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"35272621","text":"Paul Fritz Helmuth Gericke (1909 ‚Äì 2007) was a German mathematician and an historian of mathematics. ==Life== Gericke was born in Aachen on 7 May 1909. From 1926 to 1931 he studied physics and mathematics at the universities of Greifswald, Marburg and G√∂ttingen. In 1931, he obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the Volta effect. In 1934, he was an assistant to Wilhelm S√ºss in Freiburg. With S√ºss, he attained his habilitation in pure mathematics in 1941. After 1945, he helped S√ºss to further develop the Mathematical Research Institute Oberwolfach. His interest in the history of mathematics was aroused by the work of Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann, whom he had met in Oberwolfach in 1945 and 1946. In 1947, he began to hold lectures in Freiburg on topics related to the history of mathematics. He also received support from Heinrich Behnke, which enabled him to publish his work. In 1952 he was appointed associate professor at the University of Freiburg. He took a professorship at the University of Munich in 1963, where he was appointed as the first Professor of the History of Science. There he founded the Institute for the History of Science. In 1964, against his stated will, he was chosen as deputy chairman of the German Society for the History of Medicine, Science and Technology. In 1977, he became Professor Emeritus. He began his professional career working on differential geometry and the body of complex numbers, but from 1947 he devoted himself to subjects in the history of mathematics, publishing several books in this field. His focus was on the development of mathematics in ancient Greece and the mathematics of the 19th century.

Bansi Lal is an idle and not very intelligent man living in his (married) sister's home. His maternal grandfather is a businessman in Africa. His sister, Lajwanti, and her husband, Kirpa Ram, are very unhappy with him as he does not use his brain at work. They want him to leave. One day, he buy a magic stick from a magician thinking that the stick really has magic. This makes his sister and her husband very angry again. As he realized that the stick does not actually have any magic, he feels robbed and one day, he snatches money from the magician and runs and hides himself in a Tonga. A beautiful girl, Laali, is searching for his father, lost in the Visakhi mela (English: fair). A Tonga driver takes her with him, in the same Tonga in which Bansi is hiding, saying that he will find her father. After they leave the city, the driver tries to rape her, but Bansi rescues her and takes her home. The police locate Laali as her father reported and come to Kirpa Ram's home to get her back. Laali's father takes her back with thanks, but Kirpa Ram gets angry as the police came to his home because of Bansi and throws him out. Wandering, Bansi reaches Laali's village where he saves her from Phumman, a proud son of Khema - a patwari (English: local land record officer). Bansi stays at Laali's home. A lawyer comes to Kirpa Ram saying that Bansi's grandfather has died giving his property to Bansi. At this, as Bansi is now a rich man, and they start to search for him. As the village is in trouble because of a lion, the patwari demands some guns from his senior officers and distributes them to the young men to kill the lion, which has killed many people of the village. Laali's father takes Bansi to be a brave man, and gives him a gun. Bansi, afraid but determined not to let anyone know about his fear, goes to jungle with the gun. Incidentally, a bullet from Bansi's gun kills the lion. Bansi is honored for his bravery and his photo is published in the newspaper, which helps his sister and Kirpa Ram to locate him. Bansi, to manage his property, leaves Laali's village, promising her that he will come back. Laali asks Bansi to write letters on a shopkeeper's address. One day Bansi receives a letter from Laali; as Bansi is illiterate, his servant arranges a literate person, Saukha Ram, to read the letter and writes a reply. But the letter does not reach Laali as Phumman, bribing the shopkeeper, takes the letter. Every letter written by Bansi is taken by Phumman. Saukha Ram, a partner of Chameli - a dancer, plans to rob Bansi. To do this he decides to read Laali's letters wrong, in order to kick Laali out from Bansi's heart and make him like Chameli. Saukha Ram reads the letter wrong, which makes Bansi angry and he writes words of hatred in his reply. Laali, this time reaching in time, takes the letter from Phumman but her heart is broken on reading such a hateful reply from Bansi. But on knowing that Bansi is in a bad company, she reaches Bansi's home disguised as an officer, and frights him to take his money back to his grandfather's account in Africa. Saukha Ram fixes bribe with the officer and tells him that he kicked his beloved Laali out of his heart as part of the plan to rob Bansi. Then Saukha Ram suggests that Bansi sell all his property and at night, tries to steal Bansi's cash. But Laali, disguised as the officer, frightens him and takes all the cash from him. Bansi becomes poor again and all his good time friends back off. Disappointed, Bansi tries to commit suicide but Laali saves him, telling him that she still loves him, and takes him home.

It portrays the events in the life of a person, who loses his family overnight, and how he copes up with life after that. ==Plot== Krishnamurthy has almost a perfect life, a brilliant programmer and a partner at a software firm he has a handsome salary along with an efficient secretary and a little annoying managing partner. His family is more than perfect - a beautiful and loving wife, an angel of a daughter, and a caring uncle. The story begins with Krishnamurthy and his wife Kalyani discussing about the school admission of their three-year-old daughter. With the help of uncle Kothari, who stays with them, they get an interview in a prestigious school in Madras. Though all the three are worried about the admissions, the little girl, Andal Roja Krishnamurthy, impresses the principal with her smart talk and gets into the school. Back at Murthy's office, they win a contract with their client, and Murthy and his managing partner, Manavaalan, need to travel to the United States in a week. Initially Murthy is reluctant since the day of travel clashes with his nephew's wedding, but after working out a plan he agrees to it. So, as planned he leaves immediately after the wedding, but not happy about leaving his family still in Kanchipuram. After catching up with Manavaalan, he comes to know that they need to stop for a night at Hong Kong. Murthy is angered since he had to leave the wedding in a hurry just because Manavaalan wants to have fun for a night. Refusing to sleep with the girl Manavaalan has hired, Murthy just roams around the city with her till midnight. He is woken up by Manavaalan and is told that his family back home had a small accident. Confused and worried, not able to know what has happened, Murthy travels back to India to find that his wife, child and his uncle had died in a road accident when they were travelling back to Madras. Devastated and dejected, Murthy blames himself for leaving them. He is angry at everyone, especially Manavaalan. He then decides to commit suicide so he can join his family after death. Eventually Murthy drives a car insanely and gets into an accident, but survives. After being unconscious for a few days, he wakes up in a hospital where he is watched continuously. Manavaalan visits him frequently. The doctor introduces Murthy to meet a girl named Supriya who also had tried to commit suicide unsuccessfully, but is alright now. Murthy refuses to talk to her and snaps at her. Later after being treated for his injuries, he goes back to his home, and to work. Though he still thinks of suicide, he inwardly knows that he doesn't have the courage to do it. He goes to Kanchipuram and finds the photo studio that shot his nephew's wedding video. He gets an edited copy of the video with the shots in which his wife and his daughter are seen. Before coming back to Madras, he accidentally meets the girl whom the doctor introduced to him in the hospital. He gives her a lift in his office car, talks to her for a while and finds out that she tried to kill herself after her husband died. He understands that her grief is similar to his, though he declines her invitation to meet later. While watching the video, he is distracted by the thoughts of Supriya. He finds out where she lives from the office car's driver who had dropped her earlier. He goes to her flat there that evening and she is more than happy to see him. They both go out and sit and talk about their lives and losses. Apparently, Supriya had lost her husband just eighteen days after their marriage. Supriya suggests that he should move in with her and they can live together just as friends since they both feel better when they are together. Murthy moves in with her the same night. She gives him his own bedroom. Unable to sleep, he calls out to her so they can talk and they both end up sleeping with each other later that night. When he wakes up, he knows that he feels much better. This starts the live-in relationship of the two, and in no time he proposes to her and they decide to get married. He, then gets a hand-written anonymous letter warning him not to trust Supriya. He ignores it, but he gets more of such letters. With the help of a friend, he finds out that his personal secretary Gunavathi is the one who has been writing the letters. He fires her, but later he gets a hint that whatever she has written in the letter might be true. He goes to meet her at her house, and comes to know that Supriya is someone that Manavaalan had hired to make Murthy get out of his misery and depression so that he could start working again. He lashes out at Manavaalan for being such a mean and money-minded person. He is mad at Supriya, who confesses that it was true and that she was never married. He calls off the wedding in spite of her begging that she, in fact, loves him. Overly depressed, he decides that he would join his wife and his baby. This time he determinedly walks in the railway tracks towards a moving train, but is distracted by the crying of a child in a train that was stationed. He finds a small girl, of his daughter's age, alone and crying. He takes this girl to the police and learns that her father is a thief who ran away after abandoning her. Seeing that no one was there to take care of this girl, he brings her to his own home to his aunt. After being bathed and dressed in clean clothes, the girl looks much better, and she reminds him of his own daughter. He remarks to his aunt that he is going to adopt her since she is his Andaal Roja Krishnamurthy. ==Key Characters== * Krishnamurthy - the protagonist who has a near perfect live till he loses every bit of it. * Manavaalan - Murthy's partner at his office * Supriya - the girl whom Murthy falls in love * Kalyani - Murthy's wife * Gunavathi - Murthy's secretary * Kothari - Murthy's uncle * Andal Roja - Murthy's daughter Category:Tamil novels Category:Novels set in Tamil Nadu ","title":"Niramatra Vanavil"},{"id":"35272776","text":"Pluchea indica is a species of flowering plant in the aster family, Asteraceae.

One origin traces it to the Shen (Ê≤à) kingdom in Runan County, Henan. These people were descended from Shao Hao, whose grandson was Zhuanxu's teacher and fathered Yun Ge and Tai Dai. Tai Dai was granted Shanxi for his achievements in controlling the flooding of the Yellow River and his descendants divided into four \\"kingdoms\\": the Shen, the Yi, the Ru, and the Huang. Electing not to participate in the northern kingdoms' campaign against Chu in 506 BC, Shen was invaded and destroyed by Cai. The rulers and vassals of the former state then bore the clan name Shen to distinguish themselves. Another group descended from the rulers and vassals of the revived state of Shen after King Cheng granted it to the Zhou prince Ran Ji for suppressing the rebellion following the death of his brother King Wu. A third group derived from the Mi () family of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. Chu had conquered the area of Shen and, in 506 BC, its governor was Shenyin Shua Chu field marshal from a cadet branch of the royal house. He was killed in the Battle of Boju that year,\\"Ê≤àÂ∞πÊàç [Shenyin Shu]\\". opposing a Wu invasion led by Wu Zixu and Sun Tzu. In his memory, some of his descendants and vassals adopted the clan name Shen for his fief, while others became the Ye after the fief granted to Shenyin Shu's son Shen Zhuliang, better known as the Duke of Ye (ËëâÂÖ¨, Ye Gong).\\"ËëâÂßì‰æÜÊ∫êÂèäÈÉ°ÊúõÂ†ÇËôü .\\" ==Branches== The You clan () is said to be a branch of the Shen clan, having simply removed the side-water radical Ê∞µ from their surname sometime in the 10th century due to conflict with a different Shen () ruling family in Fujian Province. Owing to this, the You and Shen continued to be unable to intermarry, just as if they were still a single clan. The side-water radical (: shu«ê) plus (: y√≠n) results in the Chinese character surname (: shƒõn). ==Historical figures with the Surname== Shen Kuo (Ê≤àÊã¨) *Shen Kuo (Ê≤àÊã¨), Ancient Polymathic

He made his debut in the Tamil film Moscowin Kavery (2010), before playing leading roles as a man with cerebral palsy in Vinmeengal and as a mechanic in Soorya Nagaram. He has since gone on to make a career as a leading actor in the Telugu film industry. He made his debut as a director with a Telugu film Chi La Sow (2018) for which he won the National Award for Best Original Screenplay. ==Early life and family== Rahul Ravindran was born and brought up in Chennai, though his roots are from the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. After graduating from Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, he earned his bachelor's degree in Commerce. He then went on to get a Masters in Business Management, and then was an Assistant Brand Manager for a leading media company in Mumbai. ==Career== It was in Mumbai, while dining at a restaurant, that he got an offer to audition for a television commercial to be directed by Dibakar Banerjee of Khosla Ka Ghosla fame, and the success of that fetched him more commercials. During this period he was also dubbing in Tamil for cartoons and children's shows being aired on television channels, notably being the Tamil voice of the Red Ranger in Power Rangers - Mystic Force and the White Ranger in Power Rangers SPD. He then quit his job and came back to Chennai to try to find work as an assistant director, but before he could do so director Ravi Varman's team members saw his ad work and called him to audition for Moscowin Kavery. The film introduced a host of new actors including Samantha, with music carried out by Thaman, then making his debut in music composing. However, due to Ravi Varman's date conflicts with his projects as a cinematographer, the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010. The film gained unanimously poor reviews from critics, with Rahul winning mixed reviews for his performance. While a critic from Behindwoods.com noted that \\"he looks every bit the suave software professional\\", other critics saying that his performance was \\"wooden\\" and that he \\"smiles too much and looks like he could do well, given the chance\\". He was next seen in Vignesh Menon's Vinmeengal, where he played Jeeva, who is affected by cerebral palsy. The film which also featured Anuja Iyer, Bhavana Rao and Pandiarajan won above average reviews, with Rahul's performance being appreciated. The Indian Express cited that \\"Rahul brings out splendidly not just the physicality of his character, but also the emotional trauma\\", while Behindwoods.com noted that \\"the handsome Rahul Ravindran utilizes his opportunity and delivers the goods well.\\"http://expressbuzz.com/entertainment/reviews/vinmeengal/373229.html/ However, the critic from The Hindu noted \\"at times Rahul's trauma doesn't come out effectively, so you feel he could have done better\\". His third film, Chellamuthu's Soorya Nagaram opposite Meera Nandan faced a much smaller release and won average reviews from critics. Playing Vetrivel, a shop mechanic in Madurai, the film focussed on inter-caste marriage and parental opposition, with a critic citing that Rahul is \\"good and emotes well\\". Later in 2012, he featured in the Telugu film Andala Rakshasi, earning positive reviews for his performance and earning him further opportunities in the Telugu film industry. In 2013, Rahul played a supporting role in the romantic comedy Vanakkam Chennai, featuring alongside Shiva and Priya Anand, with the film performing well at the box office. His Telugu releases in the year, Pelli Pustakam and Nenem‚Ä¶Chinna Pillana?, had significantly smaller budgets and did not fare as well. His 2014 release, Ala Ela became a sleeper hit at the box office, with the film earning audiences through positive word-of-mouth via social media.http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/rahul-reaps-the- benefits/article6728367.ece?secpage=true&secname;=entertainment ==Personal life== Rahul Ravindran is married to singer Chinmayi, whom he began dating in June 2013 after being introduced through mutual friends.

It is situated on the south side of the Frourio Hill in Larissa. ==History== The First Ancient Theatre of Larissa was constructed inside the ancient city's centre during the reign of King Philip V of Macedonia, towards the end of the 3rd century BC. The theatre was in use for six centuries, until the end of the 3rd century AD (or the beginning of the 4th century AD), when its operation was abruptly stopped. During the first centuries, the theatre served a dual purpose: apart from theatrical performances, it also hosted the assemblies of the senior regional authority, the so-called Koinon of the Thessalians. The ancient theatre of Larissa by the end of the 7th century BC had the lead and completely prevailed over a large area of fertile plain of Thessaly. The ancient theatre was initially connected to the worship of the God Dionysus, by conducting theatrical and music activities, and, secondly, with the administration of the Thessalian for meetings of the city assembly, called agora. Indications for these are a small votive altar to the god Dionysus found near the theater, and the names of representatives of the city-state who participated in the Federation of Thessaly shown on the seats of the ancient theater. The theatre has the typical structure of the Hellenistic theater with three basic components: koilon (hollow), orchestra and skene (stage) with a diameter of about 25 meters. The hollow of the ancient theater was the same slope of the hill fortress, which was shaped into terraces for the placement of benches. In the second period, at the 2nd half century BC front of the stage building, towards the band built a colonnade, the limelight. It consists of six pilasters and Doric semi-columns six monolithic bloc. At the time of the emperor Octavian Augustus and his successor Tiberius, there were found inscriptions in their honor on the foreheads of the Doric order entablature cornices of the scene. The First Ancient Theatre of Larissa, which is today a hallmark of the city and the most important tourist monument in the area, is under excavation and ongoing maintenance being conducted by local authorities. ==See also== * List of ancient Greek theatres ==References *First Ancient Theatre of Larissa ‚Äì Larissa Municipality Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 3rd century BC Category:Ancient Greek theatres in Greece Category:Cult of Dionysus Category:Buildings and structures in Larissa Category:History of Larissa Category:Archaeological sites in Thessaly ","title":"First Ancient Theatre, Larissa"},{"id":"35273032","text":"Schwefel (German for sulfur) is a German surname.

It was publicly released on 17 March 2013 with version number 5.3, after being in development since late 2008. OpenSMTPD is primarily developed by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot and Charles Longeau as part of the OpenBSD project. Its design goals include security, reliability, ease of configuration, and support for common use cases. The source code is available under the ISC license. Its portable version, like that of OpenSSH, is developed as a child project which adds the portability code to the OpenBSD version and releases it separately. The portable version was initiated by Charles Longeau and adds support for multiple operating systems including NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, and several Linux distributions. ==History== The development of OpenSMTPD was motivated by a combination of issues with current SMTP daemons: difficult configuration, complicated and difficult to audit code, and unsuitable licensing. OpenSMTPD was designed to solve these problems and make mail exchanges accessible to a wider user-base. After a period of development, OpenSMTPD first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6. The first release shipped with OpenBSD 5.3. On 2 October 2015, the results of a security audit were released. Version 5.4.4p1 was audited, and nine issues were found. As a result, OpenSMTPD 5.7.2 was released to address these issues. On 28 January 2020, a vulnerability in OpenSMTPD was disclosed that could be remotely exploited to run arbitrary shell commands as root. OpenSMTPD 6.6.2 was released to fix the vulnerability. ==Goals== OpenSMTPD is an attempt by the OpenBSD team to produce an SMTP daemon implementation that is secure, reliable, high performance, simple to security audit and trivial to set up and administer. Code is designed to keep the memory, CPU and disk requirements as low as possible but it is admitted that large mail systems are not intended to be run on low-end machines, and trade-offs are made where higher memory usage would bring indisputable benefits. As such, the design goals for OpenSMTPD are: security, ease of use, and performance. Security in OpenSMTPD is achieved by robust validity check in the network input path, use of bounded buffer operations via strlcpy, and privilege separation to mitigate the effects of possible security bugs exploiting the daemon through privilege escalation. In order to simplify the use of SMTP, OpenSMTPD implements a smaller set of functionalities than those available in other SMTP daemons, the objective is to provide enough features to satisfy typical usage at the risk of unsuitability for esoteric or niche requirements. ==References* 93495 OpenSMTPD TLS Support Socket Exhaustion Remote DoS Category:Message transfer agents Category:BSD software SMTPD Category:Email server software for Linux Category:OpenBSD software using the ISC license ","title":"OpenSMTPD"},{"id":"35273053","text":"Quiller is a fictional spy created by English novelist Elleston Trevor.

It was set up in 1997 and has since initiated, supported and produced over 100 initiatives in 15 cities throughout Europe. It has active bases in Brussels (Belgium) and London (UK). City Mine(d) aims to make urban development everybody's business. ==Before City Mine(d)== City Mine(d) emerged from urban actions aimed at improving the quality of life in Brussels in the 1990s. Reflecting the bilingual nature Brussels and offering the minimum legal protection required, a number of Stichtingen/Foundations with the life span of a single campaign were set up: 'Stichting/Fondation Pied de Biche Open Deur', 'Stichting/Fondation Legumen' and 'Stichting/Fondation Sens Unique' are but a few examples. A first attempt to increase impact and sustainability of this circuit of initiatives was VrijstadBXLVilleLibre. However, after a founding meeting and the publication of a newspaper, this network of 'self-determined and self-organising new urban initiatives' only had a short lease of life. According to some involved, the demise was due to a lack of 'a professional back-office'. ==City Mine(d) vzw== On 21 August 1997 non-profit association City Mine(d) was set up with as a purpose \\"the organising of urban, social- artistic projects\\". It was able to do over 12 projects per year in deprived neighbourhoods of Brussels, ranging from Kureghem, where a football ground was built, to Schaerbeek, where a derelict site became a park, and from ephemeral afternoon events to constructions that lasted several years. Each summer, with Cinema Nova an open-air cinema tour was organised along 4 neighbourhoods to bring films to \\"those who can't afford to go on holiday\\". In addition, City Mine(d) became a node in the network Bunker Souple, a loose-tight connection of artists, activists and architects that wanted to develop their work and the city outside the narrow remit of institutionalised cultural production. Precare In 1999 now defunct Precare was set up to facilitate the temporary use of urban derelict buildings. By temporary using empty spaces, artists and creators could start their career at very low cost, while previously abandoned buildings became used again. Notable projects Precare was involved in are Cinema Nova and Bains Connective. Brussels 2000 When, in 2000, Brussels was one of Europe's Capitals of Culture, City Mine(d) worked to have 'informal culture' involved in its programme. With two large scale interventions - Limite Limite and Bara-ke - and a series of networking initiatives - like Bunker Souple Repertorium- it tried to give the passing glory of a cultural capital a more lasting impact. Limite Limite went on to win the prestigious \\"Thuis in de Stad Award\\" for innovative urban renewal from the regional government, while Benjamin Verdonck won wide acclaim with Bara- ke. Also in 2000, City Mine(d)'s work featured in the major millennium exhibition Mutations in Bordeaux' Arc en R√™ve Centre d'Architecture, commissioned by Stefano Boeri and as part of the Uncertain States of Europe network. During the EU Summit of 2001, City Mine(d) was heavily involved in the occupation of the Luxemburg station in Brussels. Bruxxel free zone provided an alternative for creativity and debate amidst the increasing antagonising between politicians and anti-global campaigners. Bruxel Glocal From 2003 on City Mine(d) widened its horizons by setting up offices in Barcelona (Spain) and London (UK). After publishing their own road maps to the city - The Networkbook for urban p/arts in London and Tallermapas in Barcelona - local initiatives further developed in all 3 cities. The Bruxel glocal conference in Brussels' Bozar in February 2003, with contributions by Josep Acebillo, Patsy Healey and others was an attempt to bring artists, activists and researchers from throughout Europe together to think and talk about bottom-up initiatives in a globalising context. ==Since 2010== Prototypes More recently City Mine(d) has focused on the creation of prototypes. The prototype is a tangible and practical answer to a topical social question. The development of prototypes follows a 7-step procedure http://beta.citymined.org/#plx_services_section that makes sure the result is delivered at the end, but also guarantees the involvement of a diverse group of partners. Topical questions deal with urban sustainability issues. In the past, questions dealt with revolved around water in the city [properwater 2011-2014] , the labour market [Micronomics 2007-2010] bottom up regeneration plans [can ricart 2004 -2006] The creation of a prototype is the motive for bringing together a diverse group of people. City Mine(d) refers to this group as ‚Äúa coalition‚Äù. The practical focus on realising the prototype involves individuals from different backgrounds, interests or convictions who would otherwise never sit together. In the course of the project, the ‚Äúcoalition‚Äù becomes a place where these different people develop a common understanding of a topical issue; a forum where other related issues can also be raised; and a group that from the shared experience can take a common position in public or political debate. The prototype and its coalition are also a way to challenge status quos in culture, politics as well as industry. City Mine(d) believes strongly that cities are dynamic entities, and that keeping it so occasionally requires disrupting the powers that be. Combining social and technological innovation with artistic creation gives it the freedom and responsibility to shuffle power structures. City Mine(d) LAB In an attempt to link experienced and scientific knowledge, to mobilise the knowledge built in the streets and allow this grass roots knowledge to be unlocked in universities, and conversely allow the knowledge universities develop to seep through to activism and grass roots activities, City Mine(d) set up City Mine(d) LAB, an interface between academia and activism/the field/grass roots initiatives. Tangible outcomes are collaborations in EU research on Social innovation - Singocom (2001-2004) - social exclusion - Katarsis (2006-2009). \\\\- Social Cohesion - Social Polis (2008-2010) and on Co-creation in the Co-creation network (2017-2021). ==Current projects== La Pile Exploring the room for agency of citizens in the vast sector of electricity, City Mine(d) is working on La Pile in the Brussels neighbourhood of St-Gilles until 2021 Elephant Path In the Kings Cross area of London, Elephant Path is trying to find out if residents' love of food, their skills, their talents and their passions can become a way of topping up their income.

It is considered one of the major works of architect Adolf Loos. ==Background== Loos was still starting his career in 1910 when he designed and constructed the Steiner house in Vienna, Austria. This design was much better accepted than Loos' earlier works and quickly became a worldwide example of rationalist architecture. In his buildings, Loos normally starts with one main volume in which the space, configuration, and elements follows the rules and composition of classical architecture. He organizes the interior of that volume with smaller cubes, rectangles boxes, and cylinders arranged in a volumetric puzzle of sorts. This determines the internal organization of his buildings and Loos regularly uses protrusions from the main block to create other areas of the building such as terraces. In the Steiner house, Loos uses his volumes to create a classical tripartite fa√ßade. He does this by creating a recess between the two wings of the house that continues straight to the roof. In general, Loos lets his fenestration be subdivided into squares and rectangles that all obey a modular system, which correspond perfectly with the geometry of the fa√ßade. This system sets up order on the interior such as the living room being connected to a terrace that has access to the garden. Even in this early design, Loos uses interior organization that would remain with him throughout his career. The Steiner house features a living area that is raised slightly above the ground level and separated from more private areas of the house such as bedrooms and painting studio, which was located on the first floor.In Europe, the \\"first floor\\" of a building is the first floor above ground level. Thus, the first floor is distinguished from the ground floor. In the United States, the first floor and the ground floor are generally synonymous. See storey. The served space in this house is neatly separated from the serving space by placing the serving space in the basement and attic. This was the style for which Loos strove: a refined and intricate interior with a simple and nonthreatening exterior. The Steiner house has a stucco fa√ßade like most of his other buildings but not without reason. Loos built his buildings with roughcast walls and used the stucco to form a protective skin over the bricks. Loos did not want to use the stucco as a cheap imitation rock and condemned that practice; in general he used stucco for its functionality. The stucco fa√ßades have another benefit: they create a smooth, unornamented, and white surface. This surface represents the nature of the material and also does not hint to what is inside the building. Most of Loos' works were located in open lots and did not need any party walls and yet they faced other constraints that he had to work around. In the case of the Steiner house, Loos was only able build one floor above the street level. This led him to create a one quarter round roof that is facing the street. This roof flattens out the apex and makes the two additional floors that look out onto the garden impossible to see from the street. The curved roof was an interesting choice because it was not a straight break from gabled roofs or a brand new innovative idea. Instead it was meant to demonstrate certainty of form and economy of space, proving that traditions can be manipulated or rid of completely, for a functional and non-aesthetic purpose. ==NotesReferences== Category:Buildings and structures in Hietzing Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:Modernist architecture Category:Adolf Loos buildings Category:Houses in Austria ","title":"Steiner House"},{"id":"35273119","text":"Shƒìn is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese surname .

His work has been released by Mondo and is regularly featured in Empire magazine. ==Background and early life== Moss graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2008, having studied literature. Moss is a regular guest on the IGN UK and A Life Well Wasted podcasts. His illustration work began as a hobby, but showing his work on the Internet led to commissions and helped him to make his way through university by creating popular T-shirt designs on Threadless. He initially wanted to pursue a career in advertising but ended up enjoying graphic design and illustration. ==Career== He was commissioned by Marvel Entertainment executives Craig Kyle and Kevin Feige to create a poster for the cast of Thor. Other notable works include the cover artwork for the 2011 video game Resistance 3, which prompted a trailer to be created in a similar style. He also created the covers for the first digital copies of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter book series, as well as a seven-part series of prints based on each book. In February 2013, to coincide with the 85th Academy Awards, Moss released a poster wherein eighty-five years' worth of Best Picture winners are represented with individual Oscar statuettes. Moss's Star Wars original trilogy posters Star Wars posters Along with creating custom posters for works such as Dirty Harry, The Evil Dead, RoboCop, My Neighbor Totoro, and the Star Trek episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", Moss is notable for his set of posters based on the original Star Wars trilogy. In the posters, Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are represented using imagery from each film within coloured silhouettes of C-3PO, Boba Fett, and Darth Vader, respectively. The posters were released in 2010 with a limit of 400 copies each, at a price of $50 each. In 2011, it was reported that a complete set of the three posters was listed on eBay for a price of $7,499.99. Campo Santo and Firewatch In September 2013, Moss and Mark of the Ninja lead designer Nels Anderson joined with former Telltale Games employees Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman to found Campo Santo. Moss worked closely on the design and was art director for the studio's first release, Firewatch. Inspired by the iconic style of the 1960s National Park posters, Firewatch echoes Moss‚Äôs graphic style. Moss was responsible for the game‚Äôs color and lighting scheme and handled all of the environment design language, and he also created various logos and designs for the props in Firewatch.

It is native to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.Polemonium vanbruntiae. Center for Plant Conservation.Polemonium vanbruntiae. The Nature Conservancy. This perennial herb grows erect from a horizontal rhizome, reaching one meter in maximum height. The leaves are each made up of 7 to 10 pairs of lance-shaped or nearly oval leaflets. The inflorescence is a corymb of purple-blue flowers with yellow centers. The stamens and style protrude from the bell-shaped corolla. This species is similar to Polemonium caeruleum and P. reptans. The plant reproduces sexually and vegetatively, by resprouting from the rhizome, forming large clumps of clones. Flowering occurs in June and July. This species can be found from New Brunswick and Quebec south to Maryland. It is not common anywhere but it is probably most abundant in New York. This species grows in wetlands, such as swamps, bogs, marshes, and wet spots on roadsides. It can tolerate a wide variety of wetland habitat types. The habitat is often saturated, but not flooded. The main threat to the species is the destruction and degradation of wetland habitat, for example, by flooding during dam construction. Habitat is also lost outright in the conversion to agriculture and other uses. Succession may be a threat in some areas, as the plant's open habitat becomes shaded when large and woody vegetation moves in. It is adapted to some level of disturbance in the habitat. This plant is sometimes cultivated for garden use. ==References *Understanding and Conserving Appalachian Jacob's-Ladder.

Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and civil society, the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair globalization. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy ‚Äì a global Eco-Social Market Economy. == Origins == Al Gore - Author of \\"Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit\\" The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist Al Gore in his book ‚ÄúEarth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit‚Äù. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical Marshall Plan after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for hope, solidarity and peace. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: Kofi Annan, Al Gore, Hans K√ºng, Susan George, Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, George Soros, Lutz Wicke, Georg Winter and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a kerosene tax. As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, poverty and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 civil society organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for world peace, sustainability and justice, and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters‚Äô activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and sustainability. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal of developing the initiative as openly as possible and also of winning over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the greatest possible support to the world to ensure that the plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage. In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further. Eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (‚ÄúGlobal Marshall Plan ‚Äì A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled. It was published in September 2004. In the meantime, more and more members of the European Parliament and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative has been received very well internationally and has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities. Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies. == Self-understanding == The material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, the waste of limited resources and the expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to pollution will in the next 30 years present mankind with its biggest challenge yet. The unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and population growth are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization. this has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of AIDS and looming population growth also accelerate this gap. Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self- understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide-ranging alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù and ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach, thus raising awareness and increasing lobbying. Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach. == Goals == The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives: * to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems * to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a sustainable development * to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world's civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international terrorism and endangers global security * for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race * to create fair globalisation * and to accomplish human rights and human dignity for everyone. According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be: * The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the world's market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries. * An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development. * The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and infrastructure with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability. == The logic of the plan == Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative: Investments, coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged. According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy. It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost Good Governance. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles. Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support. One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap. == Key requirements for a world in balance == Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various NGOs and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative.  Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals  In September 2000 the United Nations (UN) came together at the General Assembly to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final Millennium Declaration, globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues. In this declaration, the 192 UN member states committed themselves to the concrete Millennium Development Goals, which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization. The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative ‚Äì the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly.  Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds  A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above- mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general. The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing. The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance development aid would be available. In comparison: The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA ‚Äì over a time period of 4 years. Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars. These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable.  Fair taxation on the global value-added processes  As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds. On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self- contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan. Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global financial transactions tax, the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of climate justice and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples:  Financial transactions tax  Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the EU. Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the ‚Äúcollective intelligence‚Äù in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù of international capital, financial markets and the New Economy, this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level. A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30‚Äì40 billion could be raised each year. However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions.  Other considerations  In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an International Finance Facility and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed. Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority.  Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds  A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing). To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan. The overcoming of global market fundamentalism and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme. The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society. The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states: Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), such as organisational rights, gender equality, prohibition of child labour etc. Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio- diversity, CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the Kyoto Protocol. Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co- financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved. Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the World Trade Organization (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects. In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative. Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights. Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision- making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society. Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include: * Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels * Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries * Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption * Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit * and adequate funding The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries. A worldwide expansion of ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources.  From development aid to development cooperation  The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests. Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we‚Äôre against one another, only when we‚Äôre with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes.  Application of funds  Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy: * The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened. * The example of the already established financing organisation ‚ÄúThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria‚Äù should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN's own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan. * Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy. * An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition. * Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people ‚Äì for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers. * In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible. The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased.  Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy  With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole. == Next stages == Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non- European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19‚Äì20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative's own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body. As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences: * To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas * To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness * To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together. * To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects. * To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development * To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries. * To the European Union as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations. * To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative. * To the G8 to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots. Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children's initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly. Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative's website. The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco- Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative.  Supporters  Supporters of the initiative include Hans- Dietrich Genscher, Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), Rita S√ºssmuth, Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker, Franz Josef Radermacher, Jakob von Uexk√ºll, Ulrich Martin Drescher, Ren√©e Ernst, Sandra Maischberger (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, Franz Fischler (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), Vandana Shiva (India), Jane Goodall (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria. The supporting organisations include the Club of Rome, the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, AIESEC Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, VENRO (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria. In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan. An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website. == On a local level == Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area. The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the climate crisis, global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal ‚Äì a World in Balance ‚Äì and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy. The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally. == Literature == * Al Gore: Wege zum Gleichgewicht.

Cox left Ireland in 1977 to study marine radio and radar technology, at Riversdale College of Technology, Liverpool, UK in order to become a Radio Officer in the Merchant Navy. He then joined the Transglobe Expedition, led by Sir Ranulph Fiennes. This three-year expedition achieved the first circumnavigation of the globe on land, sea and ice via North and South poles along the Greenwich Meridian. In 1989 Cox moved to London. Transglobe expedition During the Transglobe Expedition, whose Patron was HRH Prince Charles, Cox was at sea, on an ice cap or in a remote location, surrounded by the vast and desolate spaces which had a profound effect and influenced his art. During the expedition Cox's medium was sketchbook and watercolour. ==Work== Paintings and technique Cox began painting in watercolour while on the Transglobe Expedition creating illustrations for his diary. He continued painting when living in Germany developing his technique in both watercolour and oils. In his work, Cox takes everyday people out of their busy surroundings and places them out of context, in minimalist empty landscapes. His techniques and influences are further explored in his interview in The Argus, by Margaret Roddy.

Patten (1832‚Äì1913) was an American eccentric from Seattle, Washington. Few people in Seattle knew much about his past and he was seen as eccentric because of his lifestyle and outrageous claims. He lived on a houseboat, walked around town with an umbrella on his head and spent most of his time outdoors. He claimed to have been a significant historical figure in his own right rating alongside Buffalo Bill and Kit Carson. He did become a historical figure in a different way, as a recognized part of Seattle's cultural landscape, especially after cartoonist Dok Hager created a daily comic featuring his image. He was known as Old Sport or the Umbrella Man. ==The man== Born in New York in 1832, Robert W. Patten served in the Civil War from which he drew a small pension. While prospecting in Mexico, he devised his signature hat with an umbrella mounted atop and mosquito netting tucked within. Coming to Seattle in 1890, Patten told many colorful tales of early life. He claimed that he was born in 1811, ran away from home at age nine, was adopted by Winnebago Chief Big John and romanced the chief's daughter. Later (he said) he scouted with Kit Carson and saved John Fremont from death, for which heroics (he said) Abraham Lincoln made him Chief Scout of the Army, and that he later gave up the position to Buffalo Bill. As to the veracity of his claims, it may be said that the evidence is scanty. Living on a Lake Union houseboat, and supporting himself by fishing and doing odd jobs, The Umbrella Man was a colorful figure of early Seattle. Patten was well enough known that when he had a stroke in 1910, he made the front page of the Seattle Daily Times.Seattle Daily Times, April 17, 1910, page 1. Umbrella Man stricken with apoplexy.

According to the veteran's home record, he contracted rheumatism in Maryland in 1862, along with a general disability. These gave him disabled status and allowed him into the Old Soldier's Home. ==The cartoon== DOK's Weatherman and his sidekick. This was the normal look for the cartoon. Beginning in 1909, cartoonist John Ross \\"Dok\\" Hager drew a daily cartoon of Patten for the front page of Seattle Daily Times, calling him \\"'Sport\\". With his duck sidekick named the \\"Kid\\" (who also sometimes sported an umbrella hat), the cartoon Umbrella Man dispensed wit and wisdom along with weather forecasts on the newspaper's front page. Sometimes he reflected the paper's owner's opinion, as on July 20, 1913, when he was drawn leaving town to avoid trouble with the Wobblies. DOC caricatured himself in this cartoon, with his cartoon figures Sport (the Weatherman) and the Kid (the duck) leaving town, as if scared of the Wobblies. ==Books== The Umbrella Man was the subject of two books of collected comics and witticisms: *The Umbrella Man by Dok.

He played significant role in the growing Indian nationalism of the 19th and 20th century, reinterpreting and harmonising certain aspects of Hinduism. His teachings and philosophy applied this reinterpretation to various aspects of education, faith, character building as well as social issues pertaining to India, and was also instrumental in introducing Yoga to the west. According to Vivekananda a country's future depends on its people, stating that \\"man-making is my mission.\\" Religion plays a central role in this man-making, stating \\"to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.\\" ==Indian nationalism== Vivekananda played a major role in the growing Indian nationalism in the late 19th and the 20th century, encouraging many Indians with his success and appeal in the west. His example helped to build pride in India's cultural and religious heritage, and to stand up against the British colonial system. He participated a lot during major movements against the British. Swami Vivekananda believed that India is the blessed punyabhumi, the \\"land of virtue\\": According to Swami Vivekananda it is coordinated willpower that leads to independence. He gave the British colonial system as an example, with forty millions of Englishmen ruling three hundred millions of people in India. According to Vivekananda, the forty millions put their wills together and that resulted infinite power, and that was the reason of their success. Vivekananda prescribed, to make a great future India the whole serest will lie in organization, accumulation of power, co-ordination of wills. \\"The tidal wave of Western Civilisation is now rushing over the length and breadth of the country. It won't do now simply to sit in meditation on mountain tops without realizing in the least its usefulness. Now is wanted intense Karmayoga, with unbounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart. Then only will the people of the country be roused.\\" \\\\- Swami Vivekananda According to Vivekananda the Indian race never cared about physical wealth, although they acquired immense wealth. Swami vivekananda believed in unity of all religions. ==Religion== Religion played a major role in Vivekananda's ideas. To Vivekananda religion was nothing but a waste theory. He said, According to Swami Vivekananda, religion is the idea which is raising the brute into man, and man into God. Religion was his main focus after self realization. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Vivekananda was deeply influenced by the Brahmo Samaj, and by his guru Ramakrishna, who regarded the Absolute and the relative reality to be nondual aspects of the same integral reality. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of form and formless, regarding the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive. Ramakrishna > The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, > the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is > impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and > Brahman are one. {   colspan=\\"2\\"  -  colspan=\\"2\\" Vivekananda in Chicago, September 1893.

[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world[6][7] and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.[8] He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[9] Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.[7] He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, \\"Sisters and brothers of America ...,\\"[10] in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893. Born into an aristocratic Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day. He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality. In 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to \\"the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.\\"[39] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come \\"face to face with God\\", but none of their answers satisfied him.[49][31] At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said \\"My boy, you have the Yogi's eyes.\\"[39][36] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying \\"Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense.\\"[39] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna.[48] It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna. In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884. Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College) when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion. While explaining the word \\"trance\\" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna. According to Banhatti, \\"[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist\\",[195] composing many songs and poems, including his favourite, \\"Kali the Mother\\". Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge. Universities * 24 January 1857 -University of Calcutta * 20 January 1817 -Presidency College (now Presidency University, Kolkata) * 13 July 1830 -General Assembly's Institution (now Scottish Church College) Born on 12 January 1863 at Calcutta in the West Bengal, Vivekananda was the son of Viswanath Datta and Bhubaneswari Devi. His mother became his first teacher and taught him English and Bengali. Vivekananda listened from his mother the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Being attached with the educational institutions like the Presidency College and General Assembly‚Äôs institution (now Scottish Church College), he passed B.A. and became a member of the Brahmo Samaj. His curiosity increased on the question of the existence of God and he asked one question to all whom, he met ‚Äì ‚ÄúHave you seen God?‚Äù At last he met Rama Krishna Parmahamsa, a priest of the Dakshineswar Kali temple and accepted him as his Guru. He was known then Vivekananda. His address in the parliament of Religions at Chicago as ‚ÄúSisters and Brothers of America‚Äù astonished all. He visited different parts of Europe and many foreigners including sister Nivedita became his disciple. Later on Vivekananda established Ramakrishna Mission on social, religious and cultural foundation. He wrote several books like ‚ÄòJnanayoga‚Äô, ‚ÄòBhaktiyoga‚Äô, ‚ÄòRajayoga‚Äô, ‚ÄòTo the youth of India‚Äô etc. His divinity was greatly felt by the Indians through his speech and works. He breathed his last in 1902. Reforms  Hinduism-Universal Religion  Vivekananda considered Hinduism to be the mother of all religions. He established through historical sequence. He showed that Vedic religion had influenced Buddhism which again was instrumental in influencing Christianity. He told that all the religions of the world have the same value and importance. In the Parliament of Religions he told‚Äî > ‚Äù ‚Ä¶The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a > Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the > others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law > of growth ‚Ä¶.Upon the banner of every religion soon be written ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòHelp and > not fight‚Äô,‚ÄòAssimilation and not Destruction‚Äô,‚ÄòHarmony, and peace and not > Dissension. Thus, through his universal religion, Vivekananda preached the unity of God. He told that though the paths are different for different religions but the goal is same. He attached great importance to the unity of all religions and their fusion into one universal religion.  Advaita Vedantism  Swami Vivekananda was a great lover of Vedantic philosophy. He believed in monism. He had firm faith on one God. His motto, as reflected earlier, was to establish a link among different religions. He had told that as water of different rivers mingle in the sea, similarly every religion finds itself at the feet of God. He did not see any difference between a Veda or Koran or Bible. Temple, Mosque and Church were equal for him. He preferred to meditate at any place without any inhibition in his mind. By his personal example he preached monism or Advaita Vedantism. By that he showed his toleration towards every religion. He spoke the message of Vedanta regarding the world unity and to believe shapeless God.  Caste System  He emphasized that the caste system was not by birth as per ancient hindu traditions. It is more about social structure i.e. by profession where a child born in a khatriya family can become brahmin also. A striking contrast was noticed in the idea of Vivekananda regarding the caste system. Strangely enough, he supported the Varna system as described in the Vedas. Unfolding the advantages of the caste system, he told that division of labour is a great blessing of this system. It would lead to excellence in any profession. This division, of course, will lead to a caste on the path of progress. However, he also exposed the evils of this system. Untouchability was its worst part. So, Vivekananda criticized this type of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touches‚Äù. He wanted to curb out this type of dogmatism from the society.  Estimate  Of course, Vivekananda was criticized for his idea regarding the caste system because he was an ardent believer of the casteism which he regarded as a social institution but actually, till this date, it has undoubtedly remained a religious institution. Furthermore he converted Sister Nivedita from a Christian to a Hindu, an idea or action which he told was an offence in his speeches. Some people even say that he didn't consider this as a sin as he had done it for his own religion. His idea of internationalism was regarded as a platonic utopia. However,Swami Vivekananda‚Äôs constituent endeavor to free religion from superstitions really establishes him as a great reformer. His synthesis of the materialism and spiritualism is another remarkable feature of his philosophical thought. Thus, he was a great spiritual, nationalist, internationalist and so on. Renaissance and reformation were the two peas of Vivekananda‚Äôs personality. He really brought a reawakening of the Indian culture. By his sharp intellect and reformative attitude he made Hinduism a progressive force in the world. A rare gem he was in the treasure of Indian wisdom. Undoubtedly he dazzled as a shining star in the cultural horizon of India and attracted the attention of the people of the world.  Yoga and meditation  Swami Vivekananda compared human mind with a monkey who is always restless and incessantly active by his own nature. He noticed, the human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. So, he stressed on practice of concentration, as he felt there is no limit to the power of the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes. Swami Vivekananda suggested not to do anything which disturbs the mind or makes it restless. Universalism Although embracing and propagating Universalism, he regarded Hinduism the best of all religions, and Advaita Vedanta the best of what Indian religious thought had to offer. According to Vivekananda the greatest misfortune of the world is we do not tolerate and accept other religions. In his lecture in Parliament of religions on September 15, 1893, he told a story of a frog who lived in a well for a long time, he was born there and brought up there and he used to think that nothing in the world can be bigger than that. Swami Vivekananda concluded the story: According to Vivekananda we must not only tolerate other religions, but positively embrace them, since the truth is the basis of all religions.s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles - First Series/XXII Alasinga ==Society== Social service Social service was an essential aspect of Vivekananda's ideas, and an innovation which deviated from both Advaita Vedanta and Ramakrishna. He nevertheless attributed these ideas to both, trying to reconcile them with his own ideas. According to Vivekananda, an important teaching he received from Ramakrishna was that Jiva is Shiva (each individual is divinity itself). So he stressed on Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva, (to serve common people considering them as manifestation of God). According to Vivekananda, man is potentially Divine, so, service to man is indeed service to God. Non-injury Swami Vivekananda called Jain monks the first great ascetics.BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 22-23 He praised their ancient knowledge of presence of low form of life in water:BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 24 ==Personal development== In line with the influence of western ideas, Vivekananda stressed the importance of individual development. Character building Swami Vivekananda realized three things are necessary to make every man great, every nation great: * Conviction of the powers of goodness; * Absence of jealousy and suspicion; * Helping all who are trying to be and do good. Swami Vivekananda suggested to try to give up jealousy and conceit and learn to work unitedly for others. He told that purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. He suggested to take courage and work on. Patience and steady work, according to Swami Vivekananda, this is the only way to get success. According to Swami Vivekananda \\"faith in ourselves and faith in God- this is the secret of greatness. Swami Vivekananda observed the history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves, and it is faith which calls out divinity within. So he told, if people have faith in three hundred and thirty millions of Hindu mythological gods, and in all the gods which foreigners have now and still have no faith in themselves, there will be no salvation. Education Vivekananda believed education is the manifestation of perfection already in men. He thought it a pity that the existing system of education did not enable a person to stand on his own feet, nor did it teach him self-confidence and self-respect. To Vivekananda, education was not only collection of information, but something more meaningful; he felt education should be man-making, life giving and character-building. To him education was an assimilation of noble ideas. Swami Vivekananda felt that the education that young boys and girls receive is very negative. He thinks they do not gain confidence or self-respect from these education, so according to Swami Vivekananda only positive education should be given to children.s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Translation: Prose/The Education that India needs Swami Vivekananda told, if young boys and girls are encouraged and are not unnecessarily criticized all the time, they are bound to improve in time.s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 7/Conversations And Dialogues/X He also told the youth: ==Womanhood== Swami Vivekananda warned it is completely unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in atman (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not to think that there are men and women, but only that there are human beings. Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women and it is impossible to get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women. Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved. Swami Vivekananda noticed almost everywhere women are treated as playthings. In modern countries like America, women have more independence, still, Vivekananda had noticed, men bow low, offer a woman a chair and in another breath they offer compliments like \\"Oh, how beautiful your eyes..\\" etc. Vivekananda felt, a man does not have any right to do this or venture so far, and any woman should not permit this as well. According to Swami Vivekananda such things develop the less noble side of humanity. They do not tend to noble ideals. According to Vivekananda, the ideal of womanhood in India is motherhood - that marvelous, unselfish, all-suffering, ever-forgiving mother. Vivekananda felt, in India, there are two great evils - trampling on the women, and grinding through the poor through caste restrictions. According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita is typical of India - the idealized India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature of the past and world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita. }} Sita was a true Indian by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Lectures and Discourses/The Ramayana ==See also== * Raja Yoga (book) * Bibliography of Swami Vivekananda * Anubhava (Hindu thought) ==References== Category:Advaitin philosophers Category:Philosophical theories Category:Swami Vivekananda ","title":"Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda"},{"id":"35273381","text":"Bill Shepherd (25 September 1920 ‚Äì January 1983) was an English professional footballer, who played as a full-back for Liverpool in the Football League.

It is intended that the debris accumulation is discrete such that it can be mapped, in the field and/or from aerial or satellite imagery. The origin or formative process may well not be known clearly or be changed by subsequent investigators it is advisable to have a non-genetic field reference so that discussion can then be used to ascertain, if possible, the origin. Mountain areas may currently have glaciers (glacierized) or have had glaciers (glaciated) or be subject to forms of periglacial activity.

Although scree (talus) is generally easily identified and mapped, these deposits may be modified by ice, avalanches or downlope movement to create essentially new landforms. Many small slope failures and landslides can give the appearance of moraines or protalus ramparts on slopes.

Smith (born October 30, 1954) is an American screenwriter, actor, and film and television director. A native of Atlanta, Georgia, he is descended from a long line of Georgians, dating back before the Civil War. His father was an executive in the baking industry and his mother was a housewife. He has drawn on this heritage as inspiration for his films. ==Early career== Smith's career began in 1971 at WHAE-TV46/Atlanta, while he was a high school student. The station was owned and operated by Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network. After a stint as station courier and film department assistant, he moved to the studio where he began to learn the skills that he later used to develop his own productions. In the mid-70s, he relocated to Virginia where he worked at CBN's headquarters' station, running camera for the network's flagship program The 700 Club. On April 29, 1977, he participated in the inaugural broadcast of the CBN Satellite Service which is now ABC Family. In the 1980s, Smith directed The Breakfast Club, a live daily talk show in Atlanta (which also aired weekly on the defunct PTL Satellite Network), as well as studio segments for MotoWorld, seen on The Nashville Network. He was awarded an Area Emmy by the Atlanta Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for work on the documentary Zoo Atlanta: The World's Next Great Zoo, in July 1987.The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, July 19, 1987, page D/24. In the 1990s he co-developed and directed the television series Prep Sports + for Georgia Public Television, and he directed the internationally broadcast program Praise the Lord for the Trinity Broadcasting Network. ==Recent career== January 2010 the narrative short film The Mailbox, which he wrote, directed and acted in, premiered at Atlanta's Landmark Art Cinema and won a Redemptive Film Festival Redemptive Storyteller Award. A tag-line for the movie was \\"A young boy learns the meaning of the old saying 'You only get to keep what you give away.'\\" Smith described the film as \\"sort-of a parable\\". The majority of the story takes place in rural Georgia during 1947 and centers on a family's mailbox, which the mother paints a bright yellow. The yellow mailbox is the origin of the name for Smith's own film production company, Yellow Post Pictures. In March 2012, Triple Horse Studios (which had announced plans to \\"build a Hollywood- style film studio in Covington, [GA], ultimately investing $100 million, with the goal of solidifying Covington's position as the 'Hollywood of the South.'\\"http://www.rockdalecitizen.com/news/2013/apr/13/triple-horse-to-build- film-studio-in-covington/) concluded a deal with Smith to co-produce The Engagement Ring, a feature-length movie that he wrote and was slated to direct.http://www.triplehorsestudios.com/news.aspx A romantic comedy, the story takes place on the campus of fictional Mountainview College in north Georgia. Smith had a commitment to movies set and filmed in his home state. He planned to shoot The Engagement Ring entirely in Georgia.http://www.triplehorsestudios.com/news.aspx Smith also had several more movie projects in various stages of development, including Trouble in the Plate (a suspense comedy) scheduled for release in summer, 2014; and First Georgia Blue, a Civil War drama which he hoped to release as part of the sesquicentennial commemoration of the conflict. ==Personal life== In 1976, Smith married Vicki Irene Greer. The idea of the yellow mailbox (seen in the film The Mailbox and the origin of the name Yellow Post Pictures) derived from the Greer family mailbox, which Vicki painted yellow and which was yellow while they were dating. The couple has 3 children. Smith is a graduate of Mercer University in Atlanta (BA in Religion, 1979), Master's International School of Divinity (MMin, 2012), and Regent University (MA in Cinema and television, 2013). He was ordained a Southern Baptist minister in 1993 and is a commissioned officer in the Georgia State Defense Force. ==Selected filmography== {  - ! Year !! Production !! Writer !! Director !!

He is known for his cost effective, flexible designs which focus on spatial qualities. Chang‚Äôs designs can be categorized as modern or contemporary architecture. He is also known for his home, the Domestic Transformer, which can turn into \\"24 rooms\\" within a limited space of 32 sq.m. He is currently the Managing Director of EDGE Design Institute Ltd., the renowned company he founded in 1994. ==Early life and education== Chang was born in 1962 and raised in Hong Kong. He studied at the Queen's College and later graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 1987 with an Architecture degree. == Career == After graduation from the University of Hong Kong, Chang worked at P&T; Group, an Architectural firm in Hong Kong. In 1994, Chang founded his first company, EDGE. The company was renamed EDGE Design Institute Ltd in 2003. The company works on projects for houses, retails, hotels, restaurants, and offices, and also creates products such as furniture, houseware, etc. Chang‚Äôs architecture focuses on concepts of urban space, form and material. Most of his work concentrates on flexible designs with transforming interior spaces and architecture.\\"330 Square Feet of Heaven in Hong Kong\\". \\"Nobody Home\\". He has become an influential figure in designs for compact living spaces.  Domestic Transformer  One of Chang's best known works is of his own home in Hong Kong, the project known as the Domestic Transformer. Space in Hong Kong homes has become increasingly limited because of a growing population. Chang uses his architecture skills to find solutions to crowding for the people of Hong Kong. He has lived in the same 344 square foot apartment since he was a child, and has experimented frequently with space-saving strategies as part of his research. His designs combine comfortable living, efficient use of space and practical day-to-day function.\\"24 Rooms Tucked Into One\\".

ArchDaily.  Suitcase House, Commune by The Great Wall  Another design by Gary Chang is the Suitcase House located in Beijing by the Great Wall of China. This project is one of the hotels designed for the Commune by The Great Wall, where various notable Asian architects (such as Shigeru Ban, Kengo Kuma, Yung Ho Chang, etc.) were invited to design. Similar to the Domestic Transformer, the space in the Suitcase House could adapt to different uses and programmes flexibly. This design is 44 meters by 5 meters wide, shaped like a long rectangular box. It is made from mostly timber, concrete and steel for structural support. The Suitcase House transforms from a public gathering space during the daytime to a multi-spatial hotel structure to shelter guests at night, all through uses of alternating panels and doors.  Other notable works  Chang has also designed the Kung Fu Tea Set for Italian houseware brand ALESSI; A \\"Workstation\\" for Ogilvy & Mather Asia Pacific; The Kitagata Housing Product in Gifu; The Hong Kong Pavilion at the 50th Anniversary of the PRC, Beijing in 1999.

The species is easily recognised by its mainly basal leaves which are long and linear, and its spathes, which lack hairs and are quite large. The petals are mauve-blue with the lower petal being highly reduced and the sepals fused into a cup. These features suggest it may be related to Commelina schweinfurthii and its allies, which share many of the same floral characters.

It lies along the L106 road (Nzamlique-Donguila road), 16 kilometres by road south of Nzamaligu√©. Donguila is best known for St. Paul Catholic mission founded in 1878, opposite the Pointe Denis. The general population speaks the Mekeh variant of the Fanghish language. Though found in several neighboring countries, the main type locality of the rodent, Peters's Hybomys, is Donguila. ==History== Education was part of the social activities of missionaries. At Donguila, there was a school for boys, another for girls, and a vocational school for \\"apprentices.\\" Young boys were given an essentially moral and religious instruction; secondarily they learned to read and write French. The girls were given an introduction to housework, sewing and embroidery. L√©on M'ba originated from the Fang clans who attended the Donguila's Libreville mission schools. The French Roman Catholic archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, served at the mission station from 1940-1943. Today, the Mission of St. Paul and its primary school continue to receive young Gabonese. While exploring Gabon, the English writer and explorer Mary Kingsley, is known to have moored her boat at Donguila. In the early 1970s, F√©lix Houphou√´t- Boigny persuaded his prot√©g√©, Omar Bongo, to give Donguila farm (plantation) to Bob Denard. In the 1980s, Donguila and three other remote villages with populations of 1000-1500, Bougandji, Nyali, and Bolossoville, were selected as solar energy test sites, each receiving PV-powered public service systems. Jean Obame was the village chief in the 2000s. ==Geography and climate== Komo River estuary at Donguila The village of Donguila is located on the right bank of the Komo River. The north bank, from the Ikoi River to Dongila is fronted by large banks of sand, rocks, and mud, while the land is elevated, and covered with trees and vegetation. The village is situated about eastward of the island, √éle Coniquet, and by road southeast of Libreville. It is a within the rural area of the Gabon Estuary. Surprise Rocks lie in the middle of the entrance to Komo River, about from Dongila. Mangrove swamp forms a significant part of the surrounding landscape. Donguila consists of many small villages, the most important are Nyantsobe, Mbol Ezok, Saint Henri Le Four √† Chaud (Aufourachaud), Mekome, and Edzoung Alenga. Approximately in size, the Plantation Donguila is part of the Catholic Mission Donguila; it is also located on the right bank of the estuary at the entrance of the Komo River. The climate is equatorial, hot and humid characterized by the alternation of four seasons: the short rainy season (mid-September, mid-December) the short dry season (mid-December, late January), the long rainy season (late January- mid May), and the long dry season (mid May-mid September). ==Notable people== * L√©on M'ba (1902‚Äì1967), first Prime Minister (1959‚Äì1961) and President (1961‚Äì1967) of Gabon * Paul Biyogh√© Mba (b. 1953), Prime Minister of Gabon (2009‚Äì2012) * Simone Saint-D√©nis (1930-2008), trade union leader taught at the Catholic School in the 1950s. ==References== Category:Populated places in Estuaire Province ","title":"Donguila"},{"id":"35273618","text":"Reverend Chorbishop Louis Khalil (Arabic: ŸÑŸàŸäÿ≥ ÿÆŸÑŸäŸÑ) was an educated Lebanese priest of the Maronite Church. Louis Khalil was of Lebanese descent, born in Zahl√©, Lebanon. His mother, Elmaz Zalzal (Arabic: ÿ•ŸÑŸÖÿßÿ≥ ÿ≤ŸÑÿ≤ŸÑ) was a descendant of a Lebanese aristocratic family. His father was a shell product and petrol distributor in Beqaa. == Early life == On July 25, 1936, Maronite priest Louis Khalil published a book in which he stated numerous accusations against the Syrian National Party and its leader. He did so with the approval of the Maronite Patriarch ‚ÄòArida. The booklet was entitled Al-Hizb al-Suri al-Qawmi Mu‚Äôamarah ‚Äòala al-Din wa al-Watan (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≤ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàŸÖŸä ŸÖÿ§ÿßŸÖÿ±ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜ) which means The Syrian National Party: a Conspiracy Against Religion and Country. In the book, the Rev. Khalil mentioned, ‚ÄúThis is the Syrian National Party, a secret sect endeavoring to dissolve the Holy Church and every religion as well as ethics and Lebanon.‚Äù He also argued that the principles of the Syrian National Party are against the Lebanese homeland and religion, especially Christianity. Louis Khalil's brother, Fouad Abou Takka, was a General Officer in the Lebanese army. He and General Henri Gouraud rearranged the map by drawing borders between Lebanon and Syria, thus announcing Lebanon an independent country. Due to General Abou Takka's connection to General Gouraud and Monsignor Khalil's repeated accusations against the Syrian National Party, Fawzi Abou Takka, their brother, was abducted by the SSNP and was transported and jailed in Syria where he was tortured until his kidneys failed. Fawzi was sent back to Lebanon where he died. ==Campaign against Sa'adeh== Khalil continued his campaign against Sa‚Äôadeh for a number of years through al-Bashir, a paper sponsored by the Jesuits which on many occasions engaged in squabbles with the SSNP‚Äôs paper an- Nahda. ==Reform principles== Khalil tried to substantiate his argument by refuting the reform principles of the SSNP. In his opinion, the SSNP was a conspiracy against religion mainly because it advocated in its first reform principle ‚Äúseparation of religion and state.‚Äù As he said it, ‚ÄúSeparation of religion and state is not only a sin against God, but also a crime against the state, causing its destruction.‚Äù The fourth and fifth reform principles constituted his justification for accusing the SSNP of being a conspiracy against Lebanon. In his fourth reform principle, Sa‚Äôadeh, the priest explained, wanted to abolish feudalism and establish Lebanon‚Äôs economy on the basis of socialism. ‚ÄúIn our country, we do not have feudalism...,‚Äù the priest maintained, adding, ‚ÄúWe would like to draw the attention of Christians to the fact that the Church has pronounced the principle of socialism as corrupt and contradictory to natural and divine laws...‚Äù In his fifth principle, Sa‚Äôadeh, the priest alleged, wanted to establish a strong army so he could disobey the legitimate civil authorities. The priest emphasized that ‚Äúthe authority of the Mandate is genuine. It has been founded by the Allies who have liberated us with their blood and resources. Thus, this authority is a legitimate one and should not be challenged.‚Äù In the eyes of Louis Khalil, Sa‚Äôadeh had committed a ‚Äúhorrible sin‚Äù when he challenged the Mandate authorities and called for reclaiming the sovereignty of the nation. Consequently, his party had to be disallowed and membership in it forbidden by the Maronite Church. ‚ÄúAny Christian, or rather any man endowed with reason, should not join this party the SSNP...,‚Äù Khalil warned. == References == Category:Lebanese Maronites Category:Eastern Catholic priests Category:20th-century Eastern Catholic clergy Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Louis Khalil"},{"id":"35273620","text":"In computing, a distributed cache is an extension of the traditional concept of cache used in a single locale. A distributed cache may span multiple servers so that it can grow in size and in transactional capacity. It is mainly used to store application data residing in database and web session data. The idea of distributed caching has become feasible now because main memory has become very cheap and network cards have become very fast, with 1 Gbit now standard everywhere and 10 Gbit gaining traction. Also, a distributed cache works well on lower cost machines usually employed for web servers as opposed to database servers which require expensive hardware. An emerging internet architecture known as Information-centric networking (ICN) is one of the best examples of a distributed cache network. The ICN is a network level solution hence the existing distributed network cache management schemes are not well suited for ICN. In the supercomputer environment, distributed cache is typically implemented in the form of burst buffer. == Examples == * Aerospike * Apache Ignite * Couchbase * Ehcache * GigaSpaces * GridGain Systems * Hazelcast * Infinispan * Memcached * NCache * Oracle Coherence * Riak * Redis * Memurai * SafePeak * Tarantool * Velocity/AppFabric == See also == * Cache algorithms * Cache coherence * Cache-oblivious algorithm * Cache stampede * Cache language model * Database cache * Cache manifest in HTML5 == References == ","title":"Distributed cache"},{"id":"35273635","text":"Sherry Argov (born November 5, 1977) is a French-born American author.

He studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (bachelor's degree 1930) and was from 1930 to 1933 employed as a highway engineer. In 1936 he received a PhD in mathematics under Eberhard Hopf at MIT. From 1936 to 1939 he was an instructor at Purdue University. In 1939 he became an instructor at Stanford University, where he became in 1941 assistant professor, in 1943 associate professor, and in 1946 professor. From 1947 to 1950 Schaeffer was a professor at Purdue University. From 1950 to 1957 he was a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and in the academic year 1956/57 the chair of the mathematics department.Halsey Royden: History of Mathematics at StanfordWho Was Who in America. Vol. 3: 1951‚Äì1960. Marquis Who‚Äôs Who, Chicago 1963, p. 759 Schaeffer worked with Donald Spencer at Stanford University on variational problems of conformal mapping, e.g. coefficient ranges for schlicht functions (functions analytic and one-to-one). Specifically they worked on special cases of the Bieberbach conjecture, for which they gave a proof that the third coefficient satisfied the conjectured estimate (a result already proved by Charles Loewner). Their goal was to give a proof for the fourth coefficient, but their approach would have required the numerical integration of about one million differential equations. A little later Paul Garabedian and Max Schiffer, then at Stanford, improved the Schaeffer-Spencer method and greatly reduced the number of necessary integrations; thus Garabedian and Schiffer were able in 1955 to prove the conjectured estimate for the fourth coefficient. In 1948 Schaeffer shared the B√¥cher memorial prize with Donald Spencer for their joint work on schlicht functions.Schaeffer, Spencer: Coefficients of schlicht functions, Parts I, II, III, IV, in: Duke Mathematical Journal.

He attended elementary school and was followed by a glazier apprenticeship. In 1905, at 17 years old, he joined the SPD and the trade union federation of glaziers. From 1905 to 1908 he regularly attended the party and trade union training for his knowledge of the principles of social democracy to deepen. == Policy and work == In 1909 he settled in Leipzig. He found work as a storekeeper in the co-op Zwenkau. Later became the head of the stores in Eythra and Lobst√§dt. In Lobst√§dt he founded the first local association SPD. From 1916 to 1918 he was employed during the First World War on the Western Front as a driver in the artillery. In 1918 he returned to Leipzig, where he became a member of the USPD, where he quickly gained influence. Already in the spring of 1919 Richard Lipinski took him to the county party secretary. Flei√üner returned to the SPD in 1920 and became editor of the Leipziger Volkszeitung. From 1921 to 1923 he was a city councilor, and taught himself essentially a finance committee. Flei√üner was 1922 Chairman of the District Board of Leipzig SPD. In March / April 1923 Flei√üner was appointed by the Prime Minister Erich Zeigner of Police in Leipzig. This office was held until 1933. After the takeover by the Nazis lost Flei√üner his office in March 1933. Unmittbar after his release, he was on 4 April to 20 Taken into protective custody in May 1933. After that he was unemployed for several months before he took a job at an insurance company in 1934. In 1937 he became manager of a bakery operation of his son. In 1935 he became attached to the by Stanislaw Trabalski led, illegal District Board of the SPD. Above all, Fleissner it was thanks to them that after a brief, joint custody with Erich Zeigner and Stanislaw Trabalski (November / December 1939) contacts with social-democratic-minded friends like Carlo Mierendorff and Leber to Berlin and to the liberal-conservative opposition circle around him personally known, former mayor of Leipzig Carl Friedrich Goerdeler could be included.

The white color and the arched shape of the concrete membrane reduce the lighting costs. This also helps to decrease the amount of light pollution, which allows for better usage at night time. An added benefit is the rhythmic pattern that the light projects onto the exterior.Ferrater, Carlos., and Xavier Marti Gali. Benidorm: West Beach Promenade. Barcelona: ACTAR, 2011.  Detailing  The handrails are made of stainless steel, and the benches of wood. Both were designed to be minimalist in nature so as not to detract from the composition of the promenade itself. The benches are an important part of what is considered the third, upper layer of the design. They serve as a resting place, a meeting place, or a meditation place; this usage is vital to the identity of the promenade as a distinct intermediary space.Ferrater, Carlos., and Xavier Marti Gali. Benidorm: West Beach Promenade. Barcelona: ACTAR, 2011.  Vegetation  Vegetation is also incorporated into this third layer and adds an important living element to the structure. Species include the Phoenix Dactylifera which is a reclaimed date palm and several types of flowers. Extensive consideration was taken in planning for appropriate greenery.Ferrater, Carlos., and Xavier Marti Gali. Benidorm: West Beach Promenade. Barcelona: ACTAR, 2011. All the materials used for this project are low maintenance which reinforces its sustainability. == Process ==  Design  During the design process, Ferrater reiterated various modes of representation that evolved over time and included drawings, cardboard models and digital models. Some have even been displayed in exhibitions in places all over the world such as Paris, Chicago, and his hometown of Barcelona.Ferrater, Carlos., and Xavier Marti Gali. Benidorm: West Beach Promenade. Barcelona: ACTAR, 2011.  Build  Due to the unique shape the building process was complex and required the collaboration of several manufacturers and companies. To start, a system of wooden molds were built, which eventually led to the formation of reinforced concrete.Ferrater, Carlos., and Xavier Marti Gali. Benidorm: West Beach Promenade.

The Twelve was published on October 16, 2012 by Ballantine Books. The trilogy was concluded with the publishing of The City of Mirrors, which was released in 2016. The film rights to the three novels were acquired in 2007 for adaptation into a film trilogy, but after 12 years of development and planning, it has been changed to a television series, premiering in January 2019. ==Plot== After briefly revisiting some of the surviving characters from the first book, the novel jumps back to the start of the plague. Four plot lines emerge: an autistic young school bus driver named Danny decides to take his bus on his rounds one more time; a military sniper named Kittridge holes up on a high floor of a Denver apartment building and begins shooting virals; Lawrence Grey, a janitor from the complex that Project Noah began in, wakes up in a hotel only to find himself younger and slimmer than he used to be; and Horace Guilder (a dying federal government functionary) copes with the country falling apart around him. Danny happens to come across two children, 18-year-old April Donadio and Tim, her younger brother, and picks them up. Meanwhile, Grey encounters a disoriented pregnant woman, who does not realize the dissolution of society around her, shopping for paint for her baby's bedroom in an abandoned Home Depot. She is Lila Beatrice Kyle, Brad Wolgast's divorced wife. Subsequently, Grey is mistaken as one of the workers and ends up helping Lila paint her house, and a bond is forged between the two. Danny and company drive to a stadium outside of Denver that was designated as a rescue site, only to discover it full of thousands of dead bodies. Soon after, Danny and April meet Kittridge, who successfully escaped the virals and military at Denver. After traveling several miles together, they stumble upon a FEMA semi-trailer full of survivors. Grey (who is being tracked by satellite) and Kyle are captured by Guilder and taken to a research center. Kittridge and company, with the help of Major Frances Porcheki, arrive at a refugee site just outside the research center. It emerges that the government is expecting the virals to attack the refugee camp, and, rather than moving the refugees, is going to wait until that happens in order to bomb it. While Danny and April escape in the bus, Kittridge and Tim do not, and they are killed by the bomb. Grey manages to escape after apparently killing Suresh, a medical examiner, and Nelson, then takes Guilder hostage. As Grey, Guilder, and Lila try to escape in a helicopter, the bombs fall and the helicopter crashes. Guilder knocks Grey out with a chunk of concrete. The story skips forward 75 years to about 15 years before the time of the first book. A group of families, including the Vorhees family, (Curtis Vorhees [later known as General Vorhees, aforementioned in The Passage], his wife Dee Vorhees, and their two daughters) set out to a field for a picnic. They are also joined by Nathan Crukshank and Tifty Lamont, childhood friends of Curtis and Dee. As the families have their picnic, secure in the knowledge that it's a bright day (as virals often avoid daylight), the men sweep the nearby fields for any signs of virals. It is shown that Curtis despises Tifty's presence, claiming that Tifty was responsible for the death of his brother, Boz. The plot then returns to when Curtis, Dee, Cruk, Boz, and Tifty were just children. As the gang meets Tifty, Tifty claims that he has seen the legendary Colonel Niles Coffee, and convinces the children to follow him to Colonel Coffee's camp nearby. By midnight, they travel to the camp by an underground waterway, and Tifty, being the leader, sees water rushing through the vents and yells for them to run away. Boz is killed when he is crushed against the bars by the water current, and it is at this point that Curtis becomes scarred. The story returns to the present, with the men sweeping the fields. There are secure, hardened steel shelters nearby, known as hardboxes, which offer protection and shelter if any virals were to attack. Late in the day, a solar eclipse occurs. Virals pour out of the shelters where they had been hiding and massacre the families, killing Dee. Among the virals is a seemingly human woman who is able to hypnotize some of the children and spirit them away. The story skips forward another 20 years to about 5 years after the time of the first book. Amy is working in an orphanage in the military base. Later at night, Amy has a dream in which Wolgast appears; Wolgast gives Amy a cryptic message to find and go to \\"him\\" when the time is right. Peter Jaxon has joined the Expeditionary, and is a decorated veteran. It is said that Theo Jaxon, Mausami, and seemingly Sara, were killed in the Roswell Massacre of the first book. Satch Dodd, the youngest survivor of the Massacre of The Field, in which his whole family was murdered, joins Peter at the mess hall. Alicia Donadio has tracked down the home base of Julio Martinez, one of the Twelve, and leads an operation only to find him gone and only his familiar, Ignacio, who is also a janitor from Project Noah left behind. Satch is killed by bats in a tunnel. They have been trying to find the remaining 11 members of The Twelve for five years with no success and it's clear that the government is going to stop. Peter is assigned to guard an oil delivery. He encounters Michael and his girlfriend Lore. On the way back with a convoy of fuel, they encounter the hypnotic woman from the field along with a group of virals. Peter is immune to her powers, much to her surprise, and the ambush goes poorly for both parties when one of the convoy members explodes a fuel truck. Peter, Michael, and Lore escape, as does the woman. Meanwhile, Alicia discovers a large city in Iowa and decides to investigate further. The city is run by Guilder, who is surviving along with Lila Kyle (revealed to be the hypnotic woman) by draining blood from Grey, who has been chained in a basement for 100 years. Despite this, Grey is quite sane and lucid. Kyle is in a delusional state, and Guilder is not much better. In the city is Sara, who survived the first book after all. However, she lost the baby she was pregnant with and is now serving in a concentration camp with the lower classes of the city. The city is run by \\"redeyes,\\" who are fed blood from Grey to keep young and healthy, and \\"cols\\" (collaborators), who serve as cruel enforcers. Sara's death is faked by a resistance group led by a fictional leader named \\"Sergio.\\" The real leaders are a soldier named Eustace and a woman named Nina. Sara is renamed \\"Dani\\" and is snuck into the capital building as a new assistant to Lila Kyle. Here, she discovers that her daughter, whom she thought was dead, was in fact presented to Lila Kyle as her own daughter as a prop for her delusions. Meanwhile, back at the military city in Texas, Amy and an imprisoned former Colonel Greer escape and head to Iowa. Peter, Michael, Lore, Hollis (Sara's boyfriend from the first book), and a black marketeer named Tifty, who was at the massacre of the field, head out to Iowa close behind. Alicia, unable to stand idly by, is captured by the Iowans and is brutally tortured and raped before escaping. In Iowa, it turns out that Guilder is preparing a site for all of the 11 master virals to stay permanently. They arrive, including Carter, who is much smaller than the rest. All of the parties from outside find each other (Amy, Alicia, Peter, and their groups). They find Nina from the Iowan resistance and form a plan. Amy will present herself as \\"Sergio\\" and when Guilder holds an elaborate execution and brings the entire town to watch, the resistance will be able to strike. Meanwhile, Lila becomes coherent for the first time in 100 years, gives Sara her daughter and goes to the basement to find Grey. Instead of releasing him, though, she lights the massive ether supplies she finds, destroying the capital building. Meanwhile, at the execution, Amy is confronted with the remaining 11 master virals. A massive fight erupts, where it is revealed that Carter isn't actually Carter, but Wolgast. Wolgast manages to explode a bomb that kills all the master virals and himself. Amy turns into a viral herself and leaves, leaving the others unsure whether she is alive or dead. She appears in a brief scene with Peter after he leaves the Homeland, her transformation complete. Amy visits Carter in his mind and they both prepare to wait for Zero, the first of all the virals, to come for them. Zero calls to Alicia to come join him, but Alicia replies that she will come, but only to kill him. ==Reception== Early reception for The Twelve has been mostly positive, with Kirkus Reviews praising the book. BookPage wrote that the ending to The Twelve was more satisfying than that of The Passage, but that \\"there are plenty of loose threads to keep readers eager for book three\\". Suvudu listed the book as one of its \\"Best Bets for 2012\\". ==ReferencesCharacters * Official book site Category:2012 American novels Category:American vampire novels Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:Novels set in Iowa Category:Novels set in Texas Category:American horror novels Category:Ballantine Books books ","title":"The Twelve (novel)"},{"id":"35273778","text":"James Alexander Shohat (aka Jacques Chokhate (or Chokhatte), 18 November 1886, Brest-Litovsk ‚Äì 8 October 1944, Philadelphia) was a Russian-American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania who worked on the moment problem.

Anatolia fell under Achaemenid Persian rule c. 550 BC. In the aftermath of the Greco-Persian Wars, all of Anatolia remained under Persian control except for the Aegean coast, which was incorporated in the Delian League in the 470s BC. Alexander the Great finally wrested control of the whole region from Persia in the 330s BC. After Alexander's death, his conquests were split amongst several of his trusted generals, but were under constant threat of invasion from both the Gauls and other powerful rulers in Pergamon, Pontus, and Egypt. The Seleucid Empire, the largest of Alexander's territories, and which included Anatolia, became involved in a disastrous war with Rome culminating in the battles of Thermopylae and Magnesia. The resulting Treaty of Apamea in (188 BC) saw the Seleucids retreat from Anatolia. The Kingdom of Pergamum and the Republic of Rhodes, Rome's allies in the war, were granted the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia. Anatolia subsequently became contested between the neighboring rivalling Romans and the Parthian Empire, which frequently culminated in the Roman-Parthian Wars Anatolia came under Roman rule entirely following the Mithridatic Wars of 88‚Äì63 BC. Roman control of Anatolia was strengthened by a 'hands off' approach by Rome, allowing local control to govern effectively and providing military protection. In the early 4th century, Constantine the Great established a new administrative centre at Constantinople, and by the end of the 4th century a new eastern empire was established with Constantinople as its capital, referred to by historians as the Byzantine Empire from the original name, Byzantium. In the subsequent centuries up to including the advent of the Early Middle Ages, the Parthians were succeeded by the Sassanid Persians, who would continue the centuries long rivalry between Rome and Persia, which again culminated in frequent wars on the eastern fringes of Anatolia. Byzantine Anatolia came under pressure of the Muslim invasion in the southeast, but most of Anatolia remained under Byzantine control until the Turkish invasion of the 11th century. == Early antiquity== Oriental empires c. 600 BC Lydia had become the predominant power in western Anatolia by the 7th century BC, although often subject to Assyrian control. The Lydian empire gained independence from Assyria by the end of the 7th century. The flourishing of Lydia during the first half of the 6th century BC is also dubbed the Lydian Empire period. Although the Iranian peoples had existed in the area south of the Caspian Sea (Iranian Plateau) from pre-historic times, their major influence began when the Medes united them in 625 BC allowing them to sweep away the Assyrian Empire shortly after, when Cyaxares (625‚Äì585 BC) led the invasion in 612 BC. Lydian king Sadyattes (ruled c. 624/1‚Äì610/609 BC) joined forces with Cyaxares the Mede to drive the Cimmerians out of Anatolia. This alliance was short lived, since his successor Alyattes (ruled c. 605‚Äì560 BC) found himself being attacked by Cyaxares, although the neighbouring king of Cilicia intervened, negotiating a peace in 585 BC, whereby the Halys River in north central Anatolia was established as the Medes' frontier with Lydia. Herodotus writes: :\\"On the refusal of Alyattes to give up his supplicants when Cyaxares sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the Lydians and the Medes, and continued for five years, with various success. In the course of it the Medes gained many victories over the Lydians, and the Lydians also gained many victories over the Medes.\\" Alyattes issued minted electrum coins, and his successor Croesus, ruling c. 560‚Äì546 BC, became known for being the first to issue gold coins. The southeast of Anatolia was ruled by the Assyrian Empire. Tabal was a Luwian speaking Neo-Hittite kingdom of South Central Anatolia which fell under Assyrian rule in 713 BC. == Persian rule == The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent. Anatolia remained, however, under Persian rule until the latter's overthrow by Alexander in the late 4th century BC. The Medean Empire turned out to be short lived (c. 625 ‚Äì 549 BC). By 550 BC, the Median Empire of eastern Anatolia, which had existed for barely a hundred years, was suddenly torn apart by a Persian rebellion in 553 BC under Cyrus II (Cyrus the Great c. 600 BC or 576‚Äì530 BC), overthrowing his grandfather Astyages (585‚Äì550 BC) in 550 BC. The Medes then became subject to the Persians. The Persians, who had scant resources for governing their vast empire, ruled relatively benignly as conquerors, attempting to obtain the cooperation of the local elite in governance. They ruled their vassal states by appointing local rulers, or satraps with responsibility for their satrapies (Greek: Satrapeia). However, the Greeks referred to these satraps as 'tyrants', meaning they were neither democratically elected or derived authority from dynasty. The Achaemenid Persian Empire, continued its expansion under Darius the Great (521‚Äì486 BC). The satrap system of local governors continued to be used and upgraded and other governmental upgrades were carried out. Anatolia was carved up under Persian hegemony into regional administrations (Satrapies or provinces, depending on sources) which replaced the hegemonic kingdoms prior to the conquest. Kings were replaced by Satraps. Satrap and Satrapy corresponding to Governor and Province respectively. The administration was hierarchical, often referred to as Great, Main and Minor Satrapies. The main administrative units in Anatolia were the Great Satrapy of Sardis (Sparda/Lydia) in the west, Main satrapy of Cappadocia centrally, Main Satrapy of Armenia in the north-east and Main Satrapy of Assyria in the south- east. These correspond to Herodotus's Districts I-IV. However, the number of satrapies and their boundaries varied over time. Within the hierarchical system, Sparda was a Great Satrapy consisting of the Major Satrapies of Sarda (including minor satrapies of Hellespontine Phrygia, Greater Phrygia, Caria, and Thracia) and Cappadocia. Note that Ionia and Aeolis were not considered separate entities by the Persians, while Lycia was included in semi-autonomous Caria, and Sparda included the offshore islands. Greater Phrygia included Lycaonia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia. Cappadocia initially included Cilicia, also known as Cappadocia-beside-the-Taurus, and Paphlagonia. Assyria was a Main Satrapy of the Great Satrapy of Babylon, and included Cilicia, while Armenia was a Main Satrapy within the Great Satrapy of Media.Encyclopaedia Iranica: Achaemanid Satrapies Anatolia remained one of the most principal regions of the empire during its entire existence. During the reign of Darius the Great, the Royal Road, which directly linked the city of Susa with the western Anatolian city of Sardis.  The fall of Lydia (546 BC) and the Lydian revolt  The archaeological site of Sardis, today known as Sart in Turkey By 550 BC Lydia controlled the Greek coastal cities, who paid tribute, and most of Anatolia, except Lycia, Cilicia and Cappadocia. In 547 BC, King Croesus, who had amassed great wealth and military power, but concerned by the growing Persian power and obvious intent, took advantage of the instability of the Persian revolt and besieged and captured the Persian city of Pteria in Cappadocia. Cyrus The Great then marched with his army against the Lydians. Although the Battle of Pteria led to a stalemate, the Lydians were forced to retreat to their capital city of Sardis. Some months later the Persian and Lydian kings met at the Battle of Thymbra. Cyrus won, capturing Sardis after a 14-day siege, Croesus giving himself up to Cyrus. According to the Greek author Herodotus, Cyrus treated Croesus well and with respect after the battle, but this is contradicted by the Nabonidus Chronicle, one of the Babylonian Chronicles (although whether or not the text refers to Lydia's king or prince is unclear). Lydia then became the Persian Satrapy of Sardis, also known as the Satrapy of Lydia and Ionia, although there was an unsuccessful rebellion led by Pactyas (Pactyes), the leader of the civil administration, against Tabalus, the Persian military commander (satrap) (546‚Äì545 BC), shortly thereafter. Once Lydia had been subdued, Cyrus returned to deal with problems in the East leaving a garrison to assist in the governing of his new acquisition. Almost immediately Pactyas, who had been given the responsibility of raising tributes, raised a mercenary army from neighboring Greek cities and besieged Tabulus in the citadel. Herodotus' account that Cyrus intended to enslave the Lydians seems unsubstantiated. Pactyas soon found that he had no allies and furthermore that Cyrus was acting swiftly to put down the rebellion, sending Mazares (545‚Äì544 BC), one of his generals to restore order. Pactyas subsequently fled to the coast and took refuge in the Aeolian city of Cyme. Mazares demanded that Cyme release Pactyas to him. Fearing retribution, the Cymeans sent him to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. On hearing that the Mytilenians were negotiating a price for Pactyas, the destination was changed to Chios, but they too handed him over to the Persians.From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire, Pierre Briant, Eisenbrauns: 2002, Aristodicus of Cyme and the Branchidae. Truesdell S. Brown. The American Journal of Philology Vol. 99, No. 1 (Spring, 1978), pp. 64‚Äì78 Mazares was followed by Harpagus (544‚Äì530 BC) on his death, and then Oroetus (530‚Äì520 BC). Oroetus became the first satrap recorded as demonstrating insubordination with respect to the central power of Persia. When Cambyses (530‚Äì522 BC), who succeeded his father Cyrus, died, the Persian Empire was in chaos prior to Darius the Great (522‚Äì486 BC) finally securing control. Oroetus defied Darius' orders to assist him, whereupon Bagaeus (520‚Äì517 BC) was sent by Darius to arrange his murder.  The subjugation of Ionia and the Ionian Revolt (500‚Äì493 BC)  The Aegean in 500 BC showing main events of the Ionian Revolt Cyrus had initially unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Aeolian and Ionian cities to rebel against Lydia. At the time of the fall of Sardis, only one city, Miletus, had made terms with Cyrus. According to Herodotus, when Lydia fell to Cyrus, the Greek cities begged him to allow them to exist within the former Lydian territories on similar terms to those they had earlier enjoyed, Cyrus pointed out that they were too late, and they started building defensive structures. They appealed to Sparta for help, but Sparta refused, instead warning Cyrus not to threaten the Greeks. Cyrus was unimpressed, but nevertheless headed east without bothering them further. This account seems somewhat conjectural. Following the defeat of the Lydian revolt, Mazares began to reduce the other cities in the Lydian lands one by one, starting with Priene and Magnesia. However, Mazares died, and was replaced by another Mede, Harpagus (544‚Äì530 BC), who completed the subduing of Asia Minor. Some communities, rather than face a siege, chose exile, including Phocaea to Corsica and Teos to Abdera in Thrace. Although our principal source for this period, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, implies this was a swift process, it is more likely that it took four years to subdue the region completely, and the Ionian colonies on the coastal islands remained largely untouched. According to Herodotus (Histories V, VI) around 500 BC Aristagoras, tyrant of Miletus approached Artaphernes, satrap of Lydia (c. 492 ‚Äì 480), for assistance in aiding some citizens of Naxos who had been forced to flee (C. 502 BC) and seek his help. He planned to annex not only Naxos but also the Cyclades and Euboea. With the permission of Darius he gathered a force to invade Naxos, but the expedition was a failure. Motivated by fear of the wrath of Darius he prevailed upon those in the expedition to mount an insurrection and subsequently went to Sparta (unsuccessfully) and Athens (successfully) for help. The Ionians attacked Sardis in approximately 499 BC, but Artarphernes managed to hold the acropolis, although the lower city was burnt. The Ionians retreated but were defeated by pursuing Persians at Ephesus in 498 BC, whereupon the Athenian ships withdrew. However, over the next two years open rebellion broke out from Byzantium to Caria and Cyprus. Eventually Aristagoras realized the futility of the exercise, as Artaphernes won a number of victories, and fled. Miletus fell to the Persian forces in 494 BC, following the Battle of Lade, who wreaked vengeance. The last pockets of resistance were obliterated by 493 BC. Herodotus depicts these events as the catalyst to the Graeco-Persian Wars (499‚Äì449 BC). However, Herodotus, as is so often our only source, had an agenda in his imprecise accounts, which do not fit well with what is known of the period. It is likely that the affair in Naxos represented a democratic revolt against the tyrants.  Other satrapies   Hellespontine Phrygia  A Greek mercenary (left) in the service of an Achaemenid Dynast of Hellespontine Phrygia (center) attacking a Greek psiloi (right) at the time of Pharnabazus II, Altƒ±kula√ß Sarcophagus, early 4th century BC. Hellespontine Phrygia lay to the north of the Lydia/Sardis satrapy, incorporating Troad, semi-autonomous Mysia, and Bithynia with its capital at Dascylium (modern day Ergili) on the south of the Hellespont. Previously it was part of the Kingdom of Lydia. Mitrobates was a satrap, and one of the officials killed by Oroetes (Oroetus), satrap of Sparda (Sardis), in the 520s. Because of its strategic position between Europe and Asia it was the launching pad for expeditions to subdue Thrace and Macedonia. Arsites was the last Achaemenid satrap of Dascylium (350‚Äì334 BC) according to Demosthenes, committing suicide after the Persian defeat at the battle of Granicus in 334 BC at the hands of Alexander the Great.  Greater Phrygia  Greater Phrygia was a minor satrapy of Sparda, with its capital at Celaenae. It concluded Lycaonia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia.  Semi-autonomous jurisdictions   Cilicia  Cilicia remained a semi-independent minor satrapy under both Croesus of Lydia, and under Persian rule, although paying tribute. Similarly Lycia remained under petty local dynasts, with allegiance to Persia.  Mysia  Mysia was ruled by its own dynasty within the minor satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia.  Caria  Caria was a satrap of the Persian Empire which included Lycia as well as the islands of Chios, Rhodes, and Cos at times. The appointed local ruler Hecatomnus took advantage of his position. He gained for his family an autonomous hand in control of the province by providing the Persians with regular tribute, avoiding the look of deception. His son Mausolus continued in this manner, and expanded upon the groundwork laid by his father. He first removed the official capital of the satrap from Mylasa to Halicarnassus, gaining a strategic naval advantage as the new capital was on the ocean. On this land he built a strong fortress and built up a strong navy. He shrewdly used this power to guarantee protection for the citizens of Chios, Kos, and Rhodes as they proclaimed independence from Athenian Greece. Mausolus did not live to see his plans realized fully, and his position went to his widow Artemisia. The local control over Caria remained in Hecatomnus's family for another 20 years before the arrival of Alexander the Great.  Greco-Persian Wars 499‚Äì449 BC  The Persian Empire in 490 BC The preceding events of the Ionian Revolt marked the beginning of half a century of conflict between the superpowers that faced each other across the Aegean. The Persians were already in Europe, with a presence in both Thrace and Macedonia, a position they consolidated following the suppression of the revolt between 492 and 486 BC under Mardonius and later by Darius the Great. Events of the Greco-Persian Wars From the Greek perspective the first war was when Darius assembled a fleet in Cilicia and Samos under Datis and Artaphernes (son of the satrap Artaphernes) and sailed for Eritrea in 490 BC, first taking islands such as Naxos which it had failed to capture in 500, in addition to disembarking at Marathon where they were soundly defeated. Greek (Herodotus) and Persian sources (for instance see Dio Chrysostom XI 148) differ in terms of the significance of Marathon, great victory or minor skirmish. Greece was spared further invasions when an unplanned interbellum (490‚Äì480 BC) occurred due to an insurrection in Egypt in 486 BC and Darius' illness and death that year. By 480 BC, Darius' successor, his son Xerxes I (485‚Äì465 BC) had amassed a huge army, and marched into Europe by crossing the Hellespont by means of pontoon bridges, meeting and defeating the Greeks at the Battle of Thermopylae later that year and razing Athens. However, the loss of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis gave command of the sea to the Greeks, and Xerxes retreated back to Asia. The following year (479 BC) the Greeks won a decisive land victory at Platea in which Mardonius was also killed, followed by another naval victory at Mycale. Greece then went on the offensive, capturing Byzantium and Sestos and thus controlling the Hellespont. Following these Persian reverses, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again rebelled. The focus of the war now moved to the Aegean islands with the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC. Over the next 30 years Greek forces continued to harass Persian garrisons, invading Asia Minor in the 460s with an important victory at the Battle of the Eurymedon c. 469. The wars effectively ended in 449 BC with the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, a peace being declared, which Diodorus refers to as the Peace of Callias, although this is debated. Skirmishes continued, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor continued to be pawns in the struggles. Athens and her empire in 431 BC. The Delian League in 431 BC  Final years: the invasion of the Macedonians 358‚Äì330 BC  Macedon and the Aegean in 336 BC The later years of the Empire were beset by internal turmoil. Artaxerxes III (358‚Äì338 BC) achieved the throne by violent means and was rumored to have been murdered himself. His successor Artaxerxes IV Arses (338‚Äì336 BC) also met a violent end, paving the way for the accession of his nephew Darius III (336‚Äì330), then Satrap of Armenia. Darius proved to be the last king to rule since in the same year Alexander the Great became king of neighboring Macedon. Within a year Alexander was in Thrace, putting down rebellions and securing his northern frontiers. Alexander then turned his attention to the east, landing on the shores of Anatolia near Sestos on the Gallipoli peninsula in 334 BC, and soon crossing the Hellespont into Asia (335 BC). Initially the Persians offered little resistance and Alexander began to liberate Greek city states. Alexander's route into Anatolia and beyond 334‚Äì323 BC Advancing on Dascylium he first encountered Persian troops at the Battle of Granicus in 334 BC. This battle occurred on the Granicus (Biga √áayƒ±) river near modern-day Biga in √áanakkale, on the south coast of the Sea of Marmara. The Persians were routed and the Greeks moved down the Aegean coast, taking Sardis, and besieging many cities. From the Aegean they moved east along the Mediterranean coast as far as Side in Pamphylia (333 BC), securing all of the Anatolian naval bases. From Side they moved north into the interior of Phrygia and Cappadocia before returning through the Cilician Gates to the Cilician coast, and then east towards the Gulf of Issus. It was there they encountered and defeated Darius at the Battle of Issus (333 BC). Alexander before the Battle of Issus, the best representation of his likeness On reaching Mount Amanus, scouts found the Persians advancing through the plains of Issus. Realizing that the terrain at this point favored his smaller army, Alexander attacked the Persians, who were effectively squeezed by the Macedonians. Although Darius escaped, back across the Euphrates river, leaving the rest of his family in Alexander's hands, the battle marked the end of Persian hegemony in Anatolia. Alexander then turned his attention to Syria, the eastern Mediterranean coast and Egypt. Darius himself was murdered in 330 BC, and shortly afterwards Alexander routed the remaining Persian forces at the Battle of the Persian Gate and the Achaemenid Empire was over. == Hellenistic period ==  Alexander the Great  Satrapies in the Macedonian Empire at the Partition of Babylon 323 BC Alexander (336‚Äì323 BC) succeeded his father King Philip of Macedon (359 BC ‚Äì 336 BC) on his assassination in 336 BC. Alexander invaded Asia Minor in 335 BC with a combined land and naval force, and by 333 BC had effectively vanquished the Persians in the Anatolian lands, and ending the Achaemenid Empire by 330 BC. However, he devoted the rest of his life to military conquests further east, dying in 323 BC. Thus he fulfilled his father's ambition of liberating the Greeks of Asia Minor. Administratively he continued the satrapy system, his strategy being to respect and win support from the conquered (or liberated) people's, respecting their traditions. he also positioned himself as a crusader for pan-hellenism, rescuing the Greek people of Anatolia from tyrants and oligarchs. In addition he colonised the lands he captured with Greek settlers, spreading Greek culture. One of the controversies is the extent to which the Macedonian Empire represented either rupture or continuity. The ascendancy of Greek, and by extension European culture in an area predominantly influenced by Asia to date was to leave a lasting legacy.Encyclopaedia Iranica: Alexander the GreatBriant, P. \\"Des Ach√©m√©nides aux rois hell√©nistiques: continuit√©s et ruptures,\\" Annali della Scuola di Pisa 9/4, 1979, pp. 1375‚Äì414)  Wars of the Diadochi and division of Alexander's empire  The Successor kingdoms before the battle of Ipsus, 303 BC. thumbright250px Kingdoms of the Diadochi c. 301 BC. Other In June 323 BC, Alexander died suddenly and unexpectedly in Babylon at the age of 32, leaving a power vacuum in Macedon, putting all he had worked for at risk. His vision of a unified empire proved short lived. He had no heir, and had not made apparent plans for succession. Some classical writers state he wished Perdiccas one of his generals, to take charge, and that Perdiccas envisioned sharing power, as regent, with his then unborn son, Alexander IV (323‚Äì309 BC). This was not universally accepted, and his half-brother Arrhidaeus (323‚Äì317 BC) was advanced as a candidate by Meleager. Eventually Alexander and Philip were made joint monarchs and responsibility for regional administration divided up at the Partition of Babylon (323 BC).Shipley, Graham (2000) The Greek World After Alexander. Routledge History of the Ancient World. (Routledge, New York) Philip was unable to rule effectively due to a serious disability, and both he and Alexander were soon murdered. Perdiccas himself was assassinated in 321 BC.Freeman (1999). Power often lay with the Satraps, usually generals. In Anatolia, this initial division of power at Babylon was as follows; Western Anatolia: Hellespontine Phrygia by Leonnatus, Lydia by Menander, Caria by Asander Central Anatolia: Phrygia, Lycia and Pamphylia by Antigonus, Cappadocia and Paphlagonia by Eumenes of Cardia, Cilicia by Philotas Eastern Anatolia: Armenia by Neoptolemus However, dissent was endemic, and almost continuous war ensued amongst the Macedonian generals, lasting over 40 years; these wars were referred to as the wars of the successors (ŒîŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœáŒøŒπ, Diadokhoi, or Diadochi) (323‚Äì276 BC). Although Cappadocia had been allocated to Eumenes, it had not yet been subdued and had to be put down in 322 BC, in the course of which Antigonus fell out with Perdiccas and fled to Europe from Phrygia, where he initiated a conspiracy (First War of the Diadochi). Perdiccas' murder necessitated a further partitioning and appointment of a new regent, Antipater, at Triparadisus in 321 BC. Eumenes was condemned and control of Cappadocia passed to Nicanor, while Lydia was given to Cleitus and Hellespontine Phrygia to Arrhidaeus. The second partitioning did little to quell the continuing scheming and jockeying for power. Antipater's illness in 320 BC led him to appoint Polyperchon as regent, passing over his own son Cassander, who now conspired with Antigonus. The result was civil war (Second War of the Diadochi) with Cassander declaring himself regent in 317 BC and King in 305 BC, having had Alexander IV murdered in 309 BC. Meanwhile, Antigonus in Phrygia was expanding east forcing Seleucus, Satrap of Babylon, to flee to Ptolemy, Satrap of Egypt and Libya in 315 BC (Third War of the Diadochi). This aggression brought pressure to bear on Antigonus, who soon found himself under attack in Thrace, Caria and Palestine. As a result, Seleucus was reinstated in 312 BC, and a treaty was arranged in 311 BC between Cassander, Lysimachus Satrap of Thrace, Antigonus, Seleucus and Ptolemy which divided the Empire into four spheres of influence. By 304 BC all of these had proclaimed themselves 'kings' (Basileus: ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ), effectively ending the concept of a Macedonian Empire, although it was unclear as to whether all saw themselves as the legitimate heir of the entire empire. It was Antigonus and his son Demetrius who continued to wage war (Fourth War of the Diadochi). The Fourth War culminated in the Battle of Ipsus, Phrygia in 301 BC, in which Antigonus now in his 80s faced the combined forces of Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus. Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius fled, allowing his enemies to carry out a third partition, dividing his possessions between them. In post-Ipsus Anatolia, Lysimachus held the west and north, Seleucus the east, and Ptolemy the south east. For a while Pleistarchus, Antipater's son and Cassander's brother ruled Cilicia, before being driven out the following year (300 BC) by Demetrius. The other exception was Pontus which under Mithridates I managed to gain independence. The third partition of 301 BC was no more effective at bringing stability to the region than its predecessors. Demetrius, who eventually became King of Macedon (294 BC ‚Äì 288 BC), was still at large controlling a significant naval force, raiding Lysimachus' territory in Asia Minor. Nor did the Ipsus alliance between the three kings last.  Lysimachian Empire 301‚Äì281 BC  Of the three empires carved out of Alexander's possessions following the battle of Ipsus, the Lysimachian of Thrace, Western (including Lydia, Ionia, Phrygia) and Northern Asia Minor, was the shortest lived. Lysimachus attempted unsuccessfully to extend his possessions in Europe and Greece. Some of Lysimachus' cruelty, such as the murder of his son Agathocles in 284 BC engendered both revulsion and revolt. Distrusting Seleucus, Lysimachus had now allied himself with Ptolemy. Seleucus invaded the Lysimachian lands and in the ensuing Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis in 281 BC, Lysimachus was killed and Seleucus seized control over western Asia Minor.  Ptolemaic Empire 301‚Äì30 BC  Of all the major satraps appointed on the death of Alexander the Great (323 BC), Ptolemy (323‚Äì283 BC) settled into his new province of Egypt and Libya with the least difficulty, controlling much of the Levant and at times south-eastern Anatolia. This was confirmed following the third partition following the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. However, a series of Syrian Wars (274‚Äì168 BC) between the Ptolomies and the Seleucids varied the degree of control they had in Anatolia. The First Syrian War (274‚Äì271 BC) fought by Ptolemy I's son and successor Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283‚Äì246 BC) resulted in extending these possessions to include Caria, Lycia, Cilicia, and Pamphylia, as well as the Aegean islands, only to lose some of them in the second war (260‚Äì253 BC). The territorial extent of the Ptolemies reached its zenith under Ptolemy III Euergetes (246‚Äì222 BC) and the third (Laodicean) war (246‚Äì241 BC). Thereafter the Ptolemaic powers declined. Philip V of Macedon (221‚Äì179 BC) seized territory in Caria, and Roman influence steadily increased as it progressively absorbed much of the Greek world. Egypt formed a pact with Rome and the dynasty eventually came to an end in 30 BC with the death of Cleopatra VII (51‚Äì30 BC).  Seleucid Empire 301‚Äì64 BC  Seleucus I Nicator, namesake of the Seleucid Empire On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC Seleucus (321‚Äì281 BC) was appointed to head the elite cavalry (·ºëœÑŒ±·øñœÅŒøŒπ, hetairoi) and a Chiliarch. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC he was appointed Satrap of Babylonia, but soon found himself involved in the Wars of the Diadochi. In particular this involved conflict with Antigonus, Satrap of Phrygia, to his west, who progressively enlarged his possessions to include all of Asia Minor. Eventually, at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC Antigonus was overthrown and killed, and his lands partitioned. This gave Seleucus control of south eastern Anatolia. In the ensuing years he was in conflict with Demetrius, Antigonus' son gaining and then losing Ciliciain 294 and 286 BC respectively, but then regained it shortly thereafter. His next problem was to deal with Lysimachus who now controlled Thrace and western Asia Minor. In the ensuing Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis in 281 BC, Lysimachus was killed and Seleucus seized control over the remaining lands of Asia Minor. Now reigning over all of Alexander's empire except the Ptolemaic lands in Egypt, his victory was short lived. Immediately moving to take commands of the new lands in Europe, Thrace and Macedonia he crossed into Thracian Chersonese when he was assassinated near Lysimachia by Ptolemy Keraunos, future king of Macedon. Seleucus was noted for his founding of cities, such as Antioch (one of many cities with that name), named after his father Antiochus, and which became the capital of Syria. After the death of Seleucus, the vast and unwieldy empire he left faced many trials, both from internal and external forces. His son Antiochus I Soter (281‚Äì261 BC) faced the first of many Syrian Wars with the Seleucids southern neighbours, the Ptolomies. He was unable to fulfill his father's ambitions of incorporating Thrace and Macedonia and nor was he able to subdue Cappadocia and Bithynia in Asia Minor. A new threat was incursions by the Gauls from the north west but they were repelled in 278 BC. Within Asia Minor, the power of Pergamon on the Aegean coast, a remnant of the Lysimachean Empire, was growing. Eumenes I, dynast of Pergamon, revolted against Seleucid rule and defeated Antiochus near Sardis in 262 BC, guaranteeing Pergamon's independence. Antiochus died the following year, Antiochus I Soter was succeeded by his son Antiochus II (261‚Äì246 BC) named Theos, or \\"divine\\", who conducted the Second Syrian War (260‚Äì253 BC). Eventually he was poisoned by his first wife, Laodice I who also poisoned his second wife Berenice Phernophorus, daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and her infant son. Antiochus II's son by Laodice from his first wife, Seleucus II Callinicus (246‚Äì225 BC), was proclaimed by his mother. Seleucus II oversaw the Third Syrian War (246‚Äì241 BC) with Berenice's brother, Ptolemy III Euergetes. In Asia Minor a rebellion by his younger brother Antiochus Hierax led to Seleucus II leaving the lands beyond the Taurus Mountains to him following a defeat at Ancyra in 236 BC, although the latter was eventually driven out of Anatolia by Pergamon in 227 BC.Virtual Religion: Antiochus Hierax Seleucus' sister Laodice married Mithridates II in 245 BC and brought with her the lands of Phrygia as a dowry. Despite this Mithridates joined Antiochus Hierax against Seleucus. Middle East 200 BC highlighting Seleucid Empire. Notes: 5. Rhodes, 6. Pergamon, 7. Bithynia, 8. Cappadocia After the brief reign of Seleucus II's son Seleucus III Ceraunus ( 226‚Äì223 BC), his brother Antiochus III the Great (223‚Äì187 BC) ascended the throne. By the time Antiochus III became king, the empire had already reached a low point. In the east provinces were breaking away, while in Asia Minor, subject states were becoming increasingly independent, including Bithynia, Pontus, Pergamum and Cappadocia (traditionally difficult to subjugate). A new presence was Galatia, a 3rd- century settlement of Gauls from Thrace in central Anatolia. Antiochus III set about restoring the former glories of the empire, initially campaigning in the east and subduing the independent provinces, before turning his attention to the west. His ambition to fulfill the thwarted dreams of his great great grandfather Seleucus I proved to be his undoing. His initial attempts to regain control of Asia Minor drew the attention of the growing Mediterranean power of Rome when Smyrna appealed to it for help. He then crossed into Europe in 196 BC and Greece in 192 BC but by 191 BC came up against the Roman legions at the Battle of Thermopylae where his defeat forced his retreat from Greece. The following year the Romans pursued him into Anatolia inflicting another major victory at the Battle of Magnesia in Lydia. Antiochus was forced to sue for peace and by the terms of the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC retreated beyond the Taurus Mountains, dying the following year. Anatolia now lay largely in the hands of the Romans and their allies, at least in the west. Those states that had allied themselves with the Romans were freed while Caria south of the River Maeander and Lycia were granted to Rhodes. The balance of Antiochus' lands, the largest share, were granted to Eumenes II of Pergamum. These settlements were made on the understanding that they would all keep the peace in a manner satisfactory to Rome.Cambridge Ancient History online. vol. viii c. x Asia Minor in 188 BC Treaty of Apamea 188 BC showing redistribution of Seleucid lands to Pergamon (Dark Blue before, Light Blue after) and Rhodes (Dark Green before, Light Green after). Residual Seleucid lands in pink While the Seleucids continued to maintain lands in south eastern Anatolia the empire was progressively weakened on all fronts, and became progressively unstable, torn by civil war in the 2nd century BC. After the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes (138‚Äì129) BC the empire became increasingly diminished and by the reign of Antiochus IX Cyzicenus (116‚Äì96 BC) there was little left outside Antioch and Syria. The invasion of Syria by Tigranes the Great of Armenia (95‚Äì55 BC) in 83 BC virtually extinguished the empire, a process completed when Pompey made Syria a Roman Province in 64 BC.  Independent, semi- independent and client states   Pontus 291‚Äì63 BC  Kingdom of Pontus before the reign of Mithridates VI (120 BC, Dark Purple), after his early conquests (Light Purple), and his conquests in the first Mithridatic wars (88 BC, Pink). Armenia is in Green The Kingdom of Pontus lay on the north west Black Sea coast, stretching from Paphlagonia to Colchis and bordered to the south by Cappadocia. Its mountain ranges were divided by river valleys including the Halys, Iris, and Lycus, parallel to the coast. Its main centres were on the Lycus and Iris rivers including the royal centre of Amaseia. Pontus was founded by Mithridates I (302 ‚Äì 266 BC) in 291 BC, who assumed the title of king in 281 BC. Its capital was Sinope, now the Turkish town of Sinop. Originally he had inherited Cius to the west in Bithynia, but fled from Antigonus Monophthalmos to form a new dynasty in nearby Paphlagonia. Appian states that he was directly descended from the Persian Satrap of Pontus. he consolidated his kingdom seeking alliances from neighbouring peoples, including the Gauls, as protection form the larger powers of the region. His grandson, Mithridates II (c. 250‚Äì210 BC) married into the Seleucid line, acquiring Phrygia as a dowry from Laodice, sister of Seleucus II. Later he was part of an alliance that defeated Seleucus at Ancyra in 239 BC. However, the alliance between the dynasties was further consolidated when he gave his daughter, Laodice III in marriage to Antiochus III, and another daughter to Antiochus'cousin, Achaeus. Mithridates II's grandson, Pharnaces I (c. 190 ‚Äì c. 155 BC) waged war on many of his neighbours including Eumenes II of Pergamon and Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia (220 BC ‚Äì 163 BC) as well as Galatia in 181 BC. Ultimately he gained little, although the Romans attempted to intercede. He also continued alliances with the Seleucids, marrying Nysa who was the daughter of his cousins Laodice IV and crown prince Antiochus. He was succeeded by his brother Mithridates IV (c. 155 ‚Äì c. 150 BC) who allied himself with Rome and her allies, including Pergamon. Mithridates IV was succeeded by his nephew, Mithridates V (c. 150 ‚Äì 120 BC), son of Pharnaces I. He assisted the Romans in suppressing the revolt by the pretender of Pergamon, Eumenes III. In exchange he received Phrygia from the Romans. He allied himself with Cappadocia by marrying his daughter Laodice to Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia. His son, Mithridates VI (120 ‚Äì 63 BC) reversed earlier policies of friendship with the growing power of Rome, engaging in a series of wars that now bear his name, the Mithradatic wars (88‚Äì63 BC), and which ultimately led to the end of his kingdom and dynasty. Mithridates was ambitious and planned to conquer the litoral of the Black Sea. His first campaign was against Colchis on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, and then extended as far north as Crimea. = Mithridatic wars 88‚Äì63 BC = He next turned his attention to Anatolia where he sought to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia (127 ‚Äì 94 BC) in 108 BC also acquiring Galatia and Armenia Minor but soon fell out with him over control of Cappadocia and by extension his ally Rome setting the scene for the subsequent series of Mithridatic Wars (88‚Äì63 BC). Relations between the adjacent states of Pontus, Bithynia, Cappadocia and Armenia were complex. Mithridates' sister, Laodice was queen of Cappadocia, being married to Ariarathes VI (130 ‚Äì 116 BC). Mithridates had his brother in law Ariarathes murdered, whereupon Laodice married Nicomedes III of Bithynia. Pontus and Bithynia then went to war over Cappadocia, and Mithridates had his nephew and new king, Ariarathes VII (116 ‚Äì 101 BC) killed. Ariarethes' brother Ariarathes VIII (101 ‚Äì 96 BC) ruled for a brief period before being replaced by Mithridates with his own son Ariarathes IX (101 ‚Äì 96 BC). The Roman Senate then had Ariarathes replaced by Ariobarzanes I (95 ‚Äì c. 63 BC). Mithrodates then dragged his eastern neighbour Armenia into the fray, since Tigranes the Great (95‚Äì55 BC) was his son in law. Nicomedes IV of Bithynia (94 ‚Äì 74 BC) declared war on Pontus aided by Roman legions in 89 BC launching the First Mithridatic War (89‚Äì84 BC). During this period, Mithridates swept through Asia Minor occupying most of it except Cilicia by 88 BC, before Roman retaliation forced his retreat and abandonment of all the occupied territory. Mithridates still controlled his own Pontine lands and a second war by Rome (83‚Äì81 BC) was rather inconclusive and failed to dislodge him. In the meantime the Roman presence in Anatolia was steadily growing. As with Pergamon Nicomedes who had no heirs, bequeathed Bithynia to Rome. This provided the opportunity for Mithridates to invade Bithynia and precipitated the Third Mithridatic War (74‚Äì63 BC). Mithridates' position was considerably weakened following the fall of Armenia to Rome in 66 BC. Pompey had dislodged Mithridates from Pontus by 65 BC, who now retreated to his northern domains but was defeated by rebellion in his own family and died, possibly by suicide, ending the Pontine Kingdom as it then existed. = Aftermath = The lands were divided with the western part including the capital being absorbed into the Roman province of Bithynia et Pontus, while the east was divided into client kingdoms including Pontus, with Mithridates' son Pharnaces II (63‚Äì47 BC) as king. However, he attempted to take advantage of the Roman civil war between Caesar and Pompey (49‚Äì45 BC) but was driven back by Caesar at Zela in 47 BC. Many of the centres brought into the Roman province reverted under Mark Anthony, but were eventually returned to the provincial fold, forming part of the province of Galatia as the districts of Pontus Galaticus and Pontus Polemoniacus. Pontus continued under client kings, initially descended from Pharnaces. Polemon I ruled from 38 to 8 BC, followed by his widow Pythodorida (8 BC ‚Äì 38 AD), and after her death her son Polemon II (38‚Äì62 AD). Pythidora joined her kingdom to Cappadocia by marrying Archelaus until his he was deposed in 17 BC by the Emperor Nero (54‚Äì68 AD), while Polemon II was also king of Cilicia where he continued as king after losing Pontus which then also became a Roman province.  Bithynia 326‚Äì74 BC  Bithynia was an area in north west Anatolia, south of the Sea of Marmara. It was originally just part of the Chalcedon peninsula but was extended to include Nicaea and Prusa and the cities of the coast, east towards Heraclea and Paphlagonia, and south across the Propontis to Mysian Olympus. Bithynians were of Thracian origin. There is some evidence that even before the invasion of Alexander the Great, Bithynia enjoyed some independence. After Alexander's death, Zipoetes I (326‚Äì278 BC) had himself proclaimed king in 297 BC, waging war against both Lysimachus and the Seleucids. Zipoetes was succeeded by his son Nicomedes I (278 ‚Äì 255 BC) who was instrumental in inviting aid from the Gauls, who having entered Anatolia settled in Galatia were to prove a source of problems in Bithynian affairs. Like the other Anatolian states Bithynia was torn by disputes within the ruling family and civil war. They formed various judicious alliances and marriages against the Seleucids and Heraclea and were often at war with neighbouring states. Prusias II (156‚Äì154 BC) joined Pergamon in a war against Pharnaces I of Pontus (181‚Äì179 BC) but then attacked Pergamon (156‚Äì154 BC) with disastrous consequences. His son Nicomedes II (149 ‚Äì 127 BC) sided with Rome in putting down the revolt by Eumenes III (133‚Äì129 BC), the pretender of Pergamon. His son Nicomedes III (127 ‚Äì 94 BC) became entangled in the complex intermarriages of Pontus and Cappadocia, attempted to annex Paphlagonia and claim Cappadocia. He was succeeded by his son Nicomedes IV (94 ‚Äì 74 BC) who bequeathed the kingdom to Rome, precipitating the Mithridatic Wars between Rome and Pontus who claimed Bithynia.  Galatia 276‚Äì64 BC  The Dying Gaul c.230 BC, commemorating victory of Pergamon over Galatia Copy of original by Epigonus Galatia was an area in central Anatolia, situated in northern and eastern Phrygia and Cappadocia, east and west of Ancyra (Ankara). It was settled by Gauls who were originally invited to Anatolia by Nicomedes I of Bithynia around 278 BC to aid his campaigns but remained and settled in an adjacent area over the next decade, with Ancyra as its capital city. They frequently raided surrounding lands and were hired as mercenaries in the continuing struggles between the Anatolian states. They were defeated by Attalus I of Pergamon c. 230 BC. Subsequently, the theme of the Dying Gaul, a statue displayed in Pergamon, was a favorite in Hellenistic art. Rome launched a campaign against them in 189 BC, defeating them in the Galatian War. At times part of Pontus, they became independent again in the Mithridatic Wars. They controlled territory from the Pamphylian coast to Trapezus. The Gauls retained traditional Celtic models of governance with tribes and cantons, whose rulers were described by the Greeks as Tetrachs. The territory was divided between three tribes, the Tolistobogii in the west, the Tectosages around Ancyra, and the Trocmi in the east around Tavium. Of these we know more about Deiotarus (c. 105 ‚Äì 42 BC) than many others. As chief tetrach of the Tolistobogii he was eventually granted the title of King of Galatia by Pompey, having allied himself with Rome against Pontus in the Mithridatic Wars. The title came with part of the Pontic lands, specifically Lesser Armenia in the east. Deiotarus was adroit at manoeuvering between the various internal struggles of the Roman Republic surviving to an advanced age. He formed a political alliance with Pergamon by marrying Berenice, daughter of Attalus III (138‚Äì133 BC) the last king of Pergamon. In 64 BC Galatia became a client state of Rome and a Roman province in 25 BC following the reign of Amyntas (36‚Äì25 BC).  Pergamon 281‚Äì133 BC  Pergamon an Ionian city state close to the Aegean coast, in Mysia was a remnant of the Lysimachean Empire, which was destroyed in 281 BC. Today it is at the modern town of Bergama. The site formed a natural fortress of strategic importance, guarding the Ca√Øcus plains. Capital of the Attalid dynasty, it was one of the three major cities of Asia Minor. Philetaerus who had served under Lysimachus was the ruler of Pergamon, Lysimachus' treasury, at that time, exercised some autonomy under the Seleucids who seized Lysimachus' lands, ruling from 282‚Äì263 BC. The subsequent dynasty was named Attalid, in honour of Philetaerus'father Attalis. On his death he was succeeded by his nephew Eumenes I (263‚Äì241 BC), who revolted against Seleucid rule and defeated Antiochus near Sardis in 262 BC, guaranteeing Pergamon's independence. Eumenes enlarged Pergamon to include parts of Mysia and Aeolis, and held tightly onto the ports of Elaia and Pitane. Eumenes was succeeded by his nephew Attalus I (241‚Äì197 BC) who was the first dynast of Pergamon to assume the title of 'king'. He succeeded in defeating the plundering Galatian Gauls, who had become an increasing problem in Anatolia, in 230 BC. Athena Nikephorus's (The Victory Bearer) temple was decorated with Epigonus' famous statues of the defeated Galatians. Attalus protected the Greek cities of Anatolia but harassed the Macedonians on the mainland, allying himself with Rome during the Macedonian Wars. A series of wars against Antiochus Hierax gave Pergamon control over much of Seleucid territory north of the Taurus Mountains, only to lose it under Antiochus III. The dealings with Attalus proved to be the last time the Seleucids had any meaningful success in Anatolia as the Roman Empire lay on the horizon. After that victory, Seleucus's heirs would never again expand their empire. Attalus also had to fight off neighbouring Bithynia, under King Prusias (228 ‚Äì 182 BC). Attalus' son, Eumenes II (197‚Äì159 BC) also collaborated with Rome to defeat Antiochus the Great at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. In the subsequent Peace of Apamea two years later he received Phrygia, Lydia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, and parts of Lycia from the former Seleucid possessions. He subsequently enlarged and adorned the city, building amongst other things the Great Altar. His brother Attalus II Philadelphus (c. 160‚Äì138 BC) fought with the Romans against Galatia and Bithynia and founded the cities of Philadelphia and Attalia. The last of the Attalid kings was Attalus III (138‚Äì133 BC), son of Eumenes II, who bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic. However, a pretender, calling himself Eumenes III briefly seized the throne until captured by the Romans in 129 BC. The lands occupied by Pergamon were divided up between Cappadocia and Pontus while the rest came directly under Rome. Pergamon had acted as a client state to Rome after Apamea, but after the death of Attalus III became the Roman province of Asia (Asiana). Roman client states Eastern Anatolia c. 50 AD.  Cappadocia 323‚Äì17 BC  Cappadocia is a mountainous district in central Anatolia, north of the Taurus Mountains, and west of the Euphrates and the Armenian Highlands. It was bordered by Pontus in the North and Lycaonia to the west. At one time it included the area from Lake Tatta to the Euphrates and from the Black Sea to Cilicia. The northern portion, known as Cappadocia Pontus, became Pontus, while the centre and south was known as Greater Cappadocia, predominated by a plateau. At times the northern section constituted Paphlagonia. It was strategically situated on the overland route between Syria and the Seleucid territories in western Asia Minor, and hence important to maintain access. Even as a Persian satrapy it had retained a degree of autonomy.Cambridge Ancient History vol vii(i) 426 The Hellenistic World 1984 At the time of the conquest by Alexander the Great, the Persian satrap was Ariarathes I of Cappadocia (331‚Äì322 BC), and had himself proclaimed king. Ariarathes I refused to submit to Alexander the Great and remained unsubdued by the time of Alexander's death. Cappadocia was then given to Eumenes (323‚Äì321 BC) to govern, who had Ariarthes killed. Eumenes was replaced in 321 BC by Nicanor (321‚Äì316 BC). However, despite these Greek appointments Cappadocia continued to be governed by local rulers. Ariarthes had adopted his nephew Ariarthes II (301 ‚Äì 280 BC), who fled to Armenia but then reconquered Cappadocia killing the local Macedonian satrap Amyntas in 301 BC. Nevertheless, he was permitted to continue to reign as a vassal of the Seleucids. Ariarthes's son Ariamnes (280 ‚Äì 230 BC) continued the policy of increasing independence. His son in turn, Ariarathes III (255 ‚Äì 220 BC) adopted the title of king, and sided with Antiochus Hierax against the Seleucid Empire and expanded his frontiers to include Cataonia. Ariarathes III's son, Ariarathes IV (220 ‚Äì 163 BC) consolidated his power by marrying into the Seleucid dynasty, taking Antiochis, daughter of Antiochus the Great (222‚Äì187 BC) as his wife, and assisting him against the Romans. Although the Romans proved victorious at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC) Ariarathes had another alliance which spared Cappadocia following the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC). His daughter Stratonice married Eumenes II of Pergamon (197‚Äì159 BC), a Roman ally. In this role he joined Eumenes in his struggle against Pontus. His son, Ariarathes V (163 ‚Äì 130 BC) found himself in conflict with the Seleucid Emperor, Demetrius I Soter (161‚Äì150 BC) who attempted to replace him with his brother Orophernes forcing him to flee to Rome. The Romans restored him as a joint king with Orophernes in 157 BC by dividing the kingdom. Orophernes was reluctant to cede territory and with the support of Attalus II of Pergamon (160‚Äì138 BC) Ariarathes was victorious in 156 BC.Cambridge Ancient History vol viii Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 B.C. 1989 He then allied himself with Attalus II against Prusias II of Bithynia (182‚Äì149 BC). He died in 130 BC assisting the Romans in putting down the pretender Eumenes III of Pergamon. His efforts were rewarded by the granting of Lycaonia and Cilicia to his family. The Cappadocian monarchy then fell victim to the ambitions of Pontus. Ariarathes' son, Ariarathes VI (130‚Äì116 BC) was related to the Pontine monarchy through his mother Nysa of Cappadocia. His uncle, Mithridates V of Pontus (150‚Äì120 BC) had the young king married to his daughter Laodice in order to bring Cappadocia under his control. Mithridates V's son, Mithridates VI (120‚Äì63 BC) then had Ariarathes murdered. Cappadocia was then briefly ruled by Nicomedes III of Bithynia (127‚Äì 94 BC), marrying Ariarathenes's widow, Laodice. Mithridates VI then ousted Nicomedes, replacing him with Ar√≠arathes VI's son Ariarathes VII (116‚Äì101 BC), his mother Laodice acting as regent. Mithridates also had him killed and replaced with Mithridates own son, as Ariarathes IX (101‚Äì96 BC). In 97 BC there was a rebellion against this proxy monarchy and Ararathes VII's brother known as Ariarathes VIII was called upon but swiftly dealt with by Mithridates. The death of both of the sons of Ariarthanes VI effectively extinguished the dynasty. This turmoil then prompted Nicomedes to attempt to insert a pretender claiming to be a third brother. At this point Rome intervened, Mithridates withdrew, Ariarathes IX was deposed yet again and the Cappadocians were allowed to choose a new king, Ariobarzanes I (95-c. 63 BC).Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix The Last Age of the Roman Republic, 146‚Äì43 b.c. 1992 By this stage Cappadocia was effectively a Roman protectorate and Ariobarzanes required regular intervention from Rome to protect him from the incursions of Tigranes the Great of Armenia (95‚Äì55 BC). However, siding with Rome in the Third Mithridatic War against Pontus he was able to enlarge his domains before abdicating in favour of his son, Ariobarzanes II (c.63‚Äìc.51 BC). Although Cappadocia continued as an independent state longer than its neighbours, it continued to require help from Rome to maintain its borders. Rome also controlled the succession. Ariobarzanes II married Athenais Philostorgos II, daughter of Mithridates VI and was succeeded by his son Ariobarzanes III (51‚Äìc.42 BC) who added Lesser Armenia to his territory but was executed by the Romans for opposing their control, being succeeded by his brother Ariarathes X (42‚Äì36 BC) who fared little better being executed by Mark Anthony and replaced with Archelaus (38 BC ‚Äì 17 AD) a Cappadocian nobleman. Archelaus survived by switching allegiance from Mark Anthony to Octavian, later Emperor Augustus (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD), at the Battle of Actium (31 BC) gaining Cilicia. He also united Cappadocia with Pontus by marrying with Augustus' blessing, the client queen Pythodorida of Pontus (8 BC ‚Äì 38 AD). In 17 BC he was summoned to Rome by the new Emperor, Tiberius (14‚Äì37 AD) whom he had angered by supporting a rival, and Tiberius declared Cappadocia a Roman Province ending the kingdom. Pythodorida returned to Pontus, Lesser Armenia was given to his step-son Artaxias III (18 ‚Äì 35 AD), and the remaining territories to his son.  Cilicia 323‚Äì67 BC  Cilicia lay at the eastern end of the Mediterranean coast, just north of Cyprus. It was separated from the Anatolian Plateau to the north and west by the Taurus Mountains, connected only by a narrow pass, the Cilician Gates. To the west lay Pamphylia, to the east the Amanus Mountains separated it from Syria. In ancient times Cilicia was naturally divided into two areas, Cilicia Trachaea (ŒöŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± Œ§œÅŒ±œáŒµŒØŒ±; Rugged or Rough Cilicia), a mountainous area in the west and Cilicia Pedias (ŒöŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± Œ†ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ¨œÇ; Flat Cilicia, also Kilikia Leia or Smooth Cilicia), the flat plains to the east divided by the River Lamus, now called Limonlu √áayƒ±. A major east-west trading route passed through it exiting through the Cilician Gates. Cilicia had historically been ruled by the Syennesis dynasty, with their seat at Tarsus.Cambridge Ancient History vol vi 219 The Fourth Century B.C. 1994 Even as a Persian satrapy for some of the time, Cilicia was ruled by tributary kings. Following the division of Alexander the Great's empire Cilicia was governed by Philotas (323‚Äì321 BC), then Philoxenus. Following the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC Cilicia became a battleground between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires in their Syrian Wars. Following the partition of 301 BC after the Battle of Ipsus Pleistarchus the son of Antipater and brother of Cassander ruled it separately, but he was almost immediately expelled by Demetrius the son of Antigonus I the following year. Cilicia had a habit of changing hands frequently, Demetrius losing it in 286 BC and then regaining it. Following the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC, between the Romans and the Seleucid Antiochus III, Cilicia was left to Antiochus, despite losing most lands west of there.Cambridge Ancient History vol viii 335 In the 2nd century BC, Cilicia was notorious for the pirates based along the southern Tracheian coast. After the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes (138‚Äì129) the Seleucid Empire had become reduced to Syria and adjacent Cilicia. At one stage the Seleucid Empire was divided with Philip I (95‚Äì84 BC) ruling in Cilicia while his twin Antiochus IX ruled in Damascus.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix 259 With the rise of more independent states in Asia Minor, Cilicia came under the hegemony of various surrounding kingdoms, sometimes partitioned. during the Mithridatic Wars (88‚Äì63 BC) between Rome and Pontus and their ally Armenia, Tigranes the Great of Armenia (95‚Äì55 BC) that state vastly expanded its borders at the expense of the Seleucids, and incorporated Cilicia c. 80 BC, until forced to retreat from the advancing Romans.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix 263 Roman influence was being felt in Cilicia as early as 116 BC.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix 135 In 67 BC Pompey who had suppressed the pirates created the Roman province of Cilicia as the second province in Asia Minor, eventually stretching between the provinces of Asia to the west and Syria in the east, adding Cicilia Pedias in 63 BC. By the time of the Emperor Augustus (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD) Cicilia had been dismembered, divided between the provinces of Galatia and Syria and client rulers in Cilicia Trachea. In the 1st century BC Cilicia was tied to Pontus. Darius of Pontus being replaced by Rome with Polemon I in 37 BC. When Polemon died in 8 BC, his widow Pythodorida ruled Cilicia and Pontus. She was succeeded by her son Polemon II (38 BC ‚Äì 74 AD) on her death, although he lost the Pontian throne in 62 AD. Cilicia was a very diverse area, both geographically and demographically and parts of it remained difficult for any occupying power to subdue.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix 266 During this period, minor dynasts existed within Cilicia such as Zenophanes in Olba,Cambridge Ancient History vol viii 362Encyclop√©die m√©thodique: ou par ordre de mati√®res: par une soci√©t√© de gens de lettres, de savans et d'artistes.

Its boundaries fluctuated during the 1st millennium BC but at times extended from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Armenia in the 1st century BC formed a mountainous region in eastern Anatolia, bounded to the south by Syria and Mesopotamia and to the east by that part of Media known as Media Atropatene, which represents modern day Azerbaijan and the Euphrates River. To the west lay Cappadocia and Commagene. It included the area around Lake Van, the Araxes valley (emptying into the Caspian Sea), and reached north to Lake Sevan as far as Iberia in the lower Caucasus. The Armenian highlands were geographically separated from the Mesopotamian plains, and was approached through Sophene to the south west and across the Euphrates at Tomisa in Cappadocia. The horses bred on the Armenian lands made it attractive to its neighbours. A satrapy under the Persians, it was largely ruled by the Orontid dynasty. Mithrenes (331‚Äì333 BC), the local Persian commander surrendered to Alexander the Great following the Battle of Granicus (334 BC) and was appointed to be the local satrap as had been his father Orontes II (336‚Äì331 BC). With the death of Alexander and subsequent division of the empire in 323 BC, Armenia was granted to Neoptolemus (323‚Äì321 BC). Neoptolemus, however, conspired and was killed in battle with Eumenes in 321 BC. With the subsequent fall of Eumenes, Mithrenes re-assumed power (321‚Äì317 BC) and declared himself king. He was succeeded by Orontes III (317‚Äì260 BC) and relative stability apart from his unsuccessful struggles with the minor kingdom of Sophene on his south-western frontier. During this time the capital was moved from Armavir to Yervandashat in 302 BC. During this time Armenia fell under the Seleucid Empire in the tripartite division. However, the degree of control of the Seleucids, who were constantly at war, over Armenia varied. Under subsequent monarchs, including Orontes' son Sames (260 BC) and grandson Arsames I (260‚Äì228 BC) that grip was loosened further allowing Armenia to acquire not only Sophene but Commagene, the next minor kingdom to the west, bordering on Cilicia and Cappadocia. However, the enlarged kingdom became divided in the next generation, Xerxes (228‚Äì212 BC) ruling Sophene and Commagene, while his brother Orontes IV (212‚Äì200 BC) ruled Armenia. However, Antiochus the Great, the Seleucid King (223‚Äì187 BC), led the last expansion of his kingdom, overthrowing and killing Orontes IV and bringing Armenia directly under Seleucid control in 212 BC, and appointing two satraps (strategos), Artaxias (Artaxerxes) and Zariadris. The retreat of the Seleucid forces from Europe and their defeat at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC) allowed Armenia to throw off Seleucid rule, the satraps assuming kingship under a new Artaxiad dynasty (189 BC ‚Äì 12 AD). Zariadris took the south (Sophene) following Xerxes' assassination. Artaxias I (190‚Äì160 BC) led a revolt against Antiochus. He reunited Armenian-speaking peoples in the region, often divided by surrounding states. In this context, the Armenian lands to the west of the Euphrates were known as Armenia Minor (Lesser Armenia), as opposed to Greater Armenia to the east. Artaxias also moved the capital again, this time to Artashat (Artaxata). He was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I (160‚Äì115 BC) whose major problem was incursions by Parthians to the east. The period of greatest Armenian expansion occurred with Tigranes II (The Great; 95‚Äì55 BC) who made it the most powerful state east of Rome, as the various kingdoms of western Anatolia were absorbed into the Roman sphere of influence. He consolidated his influence within Armenia, once again taking over Sophene after deposing Artanes he king. This was the period of the Mithridatic Wars (88‚Äì63 BC) between Pontus, his north western neighbour, and Rome. He formed an alliance with Mithridates VI of Pontus (120‚Äì63 BC), marrying his daughter Cleopatra. By acquiring Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia he effectively reduced the Seleucid empire to a rump state. The aggressive behaviour of both Pontus and Armenia inevitably and fatally brought them into conflict with the eastward Roman expansion with the Armenians suffering a decisive defeat at the Battle of Tigranocerta (69 BC). By 67 BC Pompey had arrived in eastern Anatolia with the express purpose of crushing these two states. Tigranes surrendered in 66 BC, and Armenia became a client state. The remaining members of the dynasty, which eventually petered out in 1 BC, had an uneasy relationship with both Rome to the west and Parthia to the east from which. Rome saw Armenia as a buffer state in relation to Parthia, requiring frequent interventions by the Romans.  Minor kingdoms  Sophene and Commagene were among minor Anatolian states that at times were independent kingdoms and at others were annexed to surrounding territories. Both lay to the west of Armenia proper, adjoining Pontus, Cappadocia and Cilicia, from north to south. = Sophene = Sophene had been a province of ancient Armenia but became independent following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. At times it incorporated Commagene. It was nominally part of the Seleucid empire at least after 200 BC but with the weakening of that empire by the Romans after 190 BC it again became independent under Roman influence with Zariadres declaring himself king, before being annexed by Tigranes the Great of Armenia (c. 80 BC). It later became a Roman province. The capital city was Carcathiocerta, near Eƒüil, on the Tigris river. = Commagene = Commagene, a country on the west bank of the Euphrates was at times part of Sophene and of Armenia. As with Sophene it came more firmly under Seleucid control in the Antiochian expansion until 163 BC when Ptolemaeus (163‚Äì130 BC) revolted and established an independent state. Antiochus I Theos (70‚Äì38 BC) submitted to Pompey in 64 BC during his campaign against Armenia and Pontus, and allied Commagene with the Romans for which part of Mesopotamia was added to the kingdom. He managed to keep Commagene relatively independent until he was deposed by Mark Antony in 38 BC. Tiberius annexed Commagene to the province of Syria in 17 AD. Its capital was at Samosata near the Euphrates.  Rhodes  The island of Rhodes, off the southwestern tip of Anatolia is not technically part of Anatolia, but formed an important strategic role in Anatolian history, formed alliances, and also ruled areas of southwestern Anatolia for a time. Under Persian rule Rhodes fell under the same satrap as the adjacent mainland areas. The Treaty of Apamea in (188 BC) established Roman control over western Anatolia and the retreat of the Seleucids from this area. The Republic of Rhodes, as an ally of Rome in the war, was granted former Seleucid lands sharing western Anatolia with Pergamon including Caria and Lycia, referred to as the Per√¶a Rhodiorum. These lands were subsequently lost to Rome in the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC). == Roman period ==  Roman Republic 190 BC ‚Äì 27 AD  Caesar); Brown: 14 AD (Death of Augustus); Pink: 180 AD (Death of Marcus Aurelius). Provincial names underlined in Grey (solid Imperial, dotted Senatorial).... boundaries prior to Diocletian revisions c. 293 AD. By 282 BC Rome had subdued northern Italy, and as a result of the Pyrrhic War (280‚Äì275 BC) established supremacy over the Greek colonies of southern Italy. Shortly afterwards the Roman Republic became embroiled in the Punic Wars (264‚Äì146 BC) BC with Carthage in the western Mediterranean. As a result of these wars Rome found itself with overseas colonies and was now an imperial power. The next encounter with the Greeks arose from Macedonian expansion and consequent Macedonian Wars (214‚Äì148 BC). Direct invasion of Anatolia did not occur until the Seleucid Empire expanded its frontiers into Europe, and was crushed by Rome and its allies in 190 BC, forcing it to retreat to the eastern part of the region. Following this the major powers of western and central Anatolia (Pergamon, Bithynia, Pontus and Cappadocia) were frequently at war, with increasing Roman intervention politically and militarily. The Roman presence increased from sporadic intervention, to creating client states to direct rule by provincilisation. Part of Roman foreign policy was the declaration of foreign states as socius et amicus populi romani (ally and friend of the Roman people) by treaty agreements.  Roman intervention in Anatolia 3rd ‚Äì 1st centuries BC  The rule of Rome in Anatolia was unlike any other part of their empire because of their light hand with regards to government and organization. Controlling unstable elements within the region was made simpler by the bequeathal of both Pergamon and Bithynia to the Romans by their kings.  Punic (264‚Äì146 BC) and Macedonian (214‚Äì148 BC) Wars  Western Anatolia, The Aegean and the Aetolian League in 200 BC. In the Second Punic War, Rome had suffered in Spain, Africa, and Italy because of the impressive strategies of Hannibal, the Carthaginian general. When Hannibal entered into an alliance with Philip V of Macedon (221‚Äì179 BC) in 215 BC, Rome used a small naval force with the Aetolian League to help ward off Hannibal in the east and to prevent Macedonian expansion in western Anatolia. Attalus I of Pergamon (241‚Äì197 BC) the dominant western Anatolian power, traveled to Rome along with Rhodes and helped convince the Romans that war against Macedon was necessary. The Roman general Titus Quinctius Flamininus not only soundly defeated Philip's army in the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, but also brought further hope to the Greeks when he said that an autonomous Greece and Greek cities in Anatolia was what Rome desired.  Seleucid invasion of Europe and retreat from western Anatolia 196‚Äì188 BC  During the period just after Rome's victory, the Aetolian League desired some of the spoils left in the wake of Philip's defeat, and requested a shared expedition with the Seleucid emperor Antiochus III (223‚Äì187 BC) to obtain it. Despite warnings by Rome, Antiochus entered Thrace in 196 BC, and crossed into Greece by 192 BC, deciding to ally himself with the League. This was intolerable for Rome, and they soundly defeated him in Thessaly at Thermopylae in 191 BC, forcing his retreat to Anatolia, near Sardis. Combining forces with the Romans, Eumenes II (197‚Äì159 BC) of Pergamon met Antiochus in the Battle of Magnesia in 189 BC. There Antiochus was overwhelmed by an intensive cavalry charge by the Romans and an outflanking maneuver by Eumenes. Because of the Treaty of Apamea the following year, Pergamon was granted all of the Seleucid lands north of the Taurus mountains (Phrygia, Lydia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, and parts of Lycia) and Rhodes was given all that remained (part of Lycia and Caria). A stronger Pergamon suited Roman interests as a buffer state between the Aegean and the Seleucid Empire. However, Rome needed to intervene on a number of occasions to ensure the integrity of the enlarged territory, including wars against Prusias I of Bithynia (187‚Äì183 BC) and Pharnaces I of Pontus (183‚Äì179 BC). Following Eumenes' support for Rome in the Third Macedonian War (170 ‚Äì 168 BC) Macedon's power had been crushed and Rome no longer felt the need for such a strong Pergamon, and the Senate set about weakening it, negotiating with Eumenes' brother Attalus II Philadelphus (c. 160‚Äì138 BC) and Prusias while declaring the recently defeated Galatians (184 BC) free. By the time his brother Attalus II succeeded him, Pergamonian power was on the decline, and the last dynast Attalus III (138‚Äì133 BC) bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. After a brief revolt by Eumenes III 133‚Äì129 BC, it became the Province of Asia under Roman consul Aquillius Manius the Elder.Hornblower(1996). Anatolia before the Mithridatic War, 90 BC.  Involvement with central Anatolian politics 190‚Äì17 BC  The interior of Anatolia had been relatively stable despite occasional incursions by the Galatians until the rise of the kingdoms of Cappadocia and Pontus in the 2nd century BC. Cappadocia under Ariarathes IV (220 ‚Äì 163 BC) was initially allied with the Seleucids in their war against Rome. However, Ariarathes changed alliances following the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC), becoming Rome's friend, and joined Pergamon against Pontus. His son, Ariarathes V Philopator (163 ‚Äì 130 BC), continued his father's policy of alliance with Rome, joining Rome and Attalus II of Pergamon (160‚Äì138 BC) in 154 BC in a war against Prusias II of Bithynia (182‚Äì149 BC). He died assisting Rome overcoming the pretender Eumenes III of Pergamon (133‚Äì129 BC) in 131 BC. His reign was marked by internal conflict that required Rome to intervene to restore him. From this stage onward Rome increasingly intervened in Cappadocian affairs, assisting it against Pontus and Armenia, creating a client state in 95 BC, and a province in 17 BC. Pontus had been an independent kingdom since the rule of Mithridates (302 ‚Äì 266 BC) when the threat of Macedon had been removed. Pontus maintained an uneasy alliance with the Seleucids and was involved in a number of regional wars, particularly under Pharnaces I (c. 190 ‚Äì c. 155 BC) some of which attracted Roman intervention. There was a brief period of collaboration with Rome under Mithridates V (c. 150 ‚Äì 120 BC) assisting the Romans in suppressing a revolt by the pretender of Pergamon, Eumenes III. This all changed under Mithridates VI (120 ‚Äì 63 BC) whose aggressive expansionist powers swept through Anatolia but soon brought him into direct conflict with Rome and the ultimately fatal Mithridatic Wars (88‚Äì63 BC). Bithynia, the other major kingdom in western Anatolia, had varying relations with Rome, and in particular its ally Pergamon. The last monarch, Nicomedes IV (94 ‚Äì 74 BC) bequeathed his kingdom to Rome, precipitating the Mithridatic Wars between Rome when Pontus claimed Bithynia.  Pontus and the Mithridatic Wars 89‚Äì63 BC  Mithridates VI of Pontus (120‚Äì63 BC) quickly set about creating his own empire. In his first thrust to extend his frontiers along the Black Sea litoral he avoided drawing the attention of Rome. Rome was preoccupied with other issues that precluded it paying attention to events east of the Province of Asia. This included the Jugurthan 111‚Äì104 BC and Cimbric Wars (113‚Äì101 BC) as well as dealing with the Scordisci. Rome, however, noticed once Mithridates turned his eye west in 108 BC, partitioning Paphlagonia with Nicomedes III of Bithynia (127‚Äì94 BC). They not only ignored Roman orders to withdraw but marched into Galatia. Next was Cappadocia, where Mithridates installed a nephew, Ariarathes VII (116‚Äì101 BC), whom he had assassinated shortly afterwards. About this time he sent envoys to Rome to elicit support for his claims, but was not successful and instead rome dispatched Gaius Marius in c. 99 BC to take him to task. Amongst further turmoil in that kingdom, he again sent to Rome for support of his latest candidate as did his rival. The Senate promptly ordered Mithridates out of Cappadocia (and Nicomedes out of Paphlagonia). Mithridates appears to have withdrawn by 89 BC, while Sulla the Governor of Cilicia was dispatched to install a new Cappadocian king (Ariobarzanes I (95‚Äìc.63 BC).Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 140‚Äì2 By 91 BC Rome was again distracted by war, this time against Italian rebels known as the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC), when two critical events occurred. Tigranes the Great (95‚Äì55 BC) ascended the throne of Armenia in 95 BC and allied himself to Mithridates through marriage, while Nicomedes died in 94 BC leaving his kingdom to his young son Nicomedes IV (94‚Äì74 BC), creating a potential opportunity for territorial expansion. Tigranes marched into Cappadocia, Ariobarzanes fled to Rome and Nicomedes was expelled. Rome became alarmed, ordered the restoration of both monarchs and sent Manius Aquillius and Manlius Maltimus to deal with the problem, and Pontus and Armenia drew back.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 142‚Äì3 = First war 89‚Äì84 BC = Asia minor 89 BC at outset of first Mithridatic war By now both Bithynia and Cappadocia were ruled by Roman prot√©g√©s and were indebted to Rome who urged them to invade Pontus, a fatal miscalculation. Nicomedes invaded Pontus, Mithridates complained to Rome, boasted of his power and allies and unwisely hinted that Rome was vulnerable. The Roman Commissioners declared a state of war and the First Mithridatic War (89‚Äì84 BC) was launched.H H Scullard, From Grachi to Nero p76 The war went well initially for the allies during 89‚Äì88 BC, since Rome was still involved in the Social War, taking Phrygia, Mysia, Bithynia, parts of the Aegean Ccoast, Paphlagonia, Caria, Lycea, Lycaonia and Pamphylia. Aquillius was defeated in the first direct engagement with the Romans, in Bithynia although the troops were actually raised locally. The other Roman commander was C. Cassius, governor of Asia, whose seat was at Pergamon, and as Mithridates overran the province, both fled from the mainland. Aquillius was handed back to Mithridates who executed him. Roman rule in Anatolia had been crushed, although a few areas of Asia Minor managed to hold out. Although Sulla was then appointed to deal with Mithridates, events moved very slowly. However, worse was to come later in 88 BC. the 'Asiatic (or 'Ephesian') Vespers', was the slaughter of tens of thousands of Romans and Italians ordered by Mithridates.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 143‚Äì9 Having cleansed Asia Minor of Romans, Mithridates looked further afield, his next victim that year being Rhodes, but it held out, and he moved on to the Aegean islands, taking Delos. A number of mainland Greek states welcomed the advance of the Pontian monarch, Sulla not having set out for Greece from Italy until 87 BC. Meanwhile, Mithridates had overcome the Roman army in Macedonia. When the two armies finally met, Sulla inflicted two defeats on the Pontic forces at the battles of Chaeronea (86 BC) and Orchomenus (85 BC) restoring Roman rule to Greece. Pontus sued for peace, faced with widespread revolts in Anatolia. Mithridates was to give up Asia and Paphlagonia, to hand back Bithynia to Nicomedes and Cappadocia to Ariobarzanes. In return he was allowed to continue ruling in Pontus as an ally of Rome, having abandoned all territories south and west of the Halys.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 156‚Äì8 Mithridates' problems were further complicated by a 'rogue' Roman army dispatched by Sulla's enemies in Rome, commanded by Flaccus and then by Gaius Flavius Fimbria which crossed from Macedonia through Thrace to Byzantium and ravaged western Asian Minor before inflicting a defeat on the Pontic forces on the Rhyndacus river. This finally led Mithridates to accept Sulla's terms (Treaty of Dardanos).Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 161‚Äì2 Although Mithridates ended the war in a weak position, the Roman Republic was facing a whole series of civil wars, in which Sulla was embroiled. In the meantime Sulla set about re-organising the Roman administration in Western anatolia until 84 BC. Those cities that had resisted Mithridates were rewarded, for instance Rhodes regained the Peraea lost in the Macedonian wars. Those that had collaborated were forced to pay reparations. The combined effects of the war and aftermath were ruinous for the region and piracy abounded. Mithradates himself faced internal problems = Second war 83‚Äì81 BC = Given that many Romans thought that Mithridates had got off rather lightly following the first war, provocation was almost inevitable. Sulla left Ephesus in 84 BC to return to Rome and make war on his enemies, where he would eventually become dictator. He left Lucius Licinius Murena to govern the province of Asia. Murena proceeded to intervene in Cappadocia in 83 BC, where Mithrodates was also interfering with the recently restored Ariobarzanes I (95‚Äì63 BC). After two further raids with less justifiable pretexts, Mithridates retaliated, pursuing Murena and inflicting a number of defeats on Murena until Sulla (who had less territorial ambition than Murena) intervened and both antagonists withdrew to their former positions. Murena had refused to recognise the treaty on a technicality and the Senate refused to ratify it despite Mithridates' efforts. Mithridates realised Rome would remain a potential threat but nevertheless continued to respect the treaty, but made military preparations for the possibility of a third war. The next step by Rome was to restore control over the areas to the south east which they had lost in the first war (Pamphylia, Pisidia and Lycaonia). So the area was brought under provincial administration by creating Cilicia (which technically included none of the historical Cilician territory further east) under Publius Servilius, as pro-Consul (78‚Äì74 BC). Servilius set about cleansing the Pamphylian coast of pirates before subduing Pisidia and Isauria. The building of military roads through Cilicia now created a new potential threat to Mithridates and Pontus. Regions of Asia Minor in Classical PeriodCambridge Ancient History vol. ix 229‚Äì233 = Third war 75‚Äì63 BC = When Nicomedes IV of Bithynia (94‚Äì74 BC) died, leaving his kingdom to Rome, he created not only a potential power vacuum, but further encircled Pontus. The Senate had instructed the propraetor of the province of Asia to take over Bithynia. This coincided with the death of Servilius' successor as proconsul of Cilicia, which then came under the command of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, while Bithynia was assigned to Marcus Aurelius Cotta. Both consuls were instructed to prepare to pursue Mithridates, by Cicero. By the time Lucullus arrived in 73 BC, Mithridates was anticipating him. Lucullus was assembling his legions in northern Phrygia, when Mithridates advanced rapidly through Paphlagonia into Bithynia, where he joined his naval forces and defeated the Roman fleet commanded by Cotta at the Battle of Chalcedon. Having besieged Cotta in Chalcedon, Mithridates continued west towards Cyzicus, in Mysia. Lucullus went to relieve Cotta and then moved on to Cyzicus, which Mithridates was besieging. The city held out and Mithridates withdrew suffering heavy losses at the Battles of the Rhyndacus and Granicus in 72 BC. After a series of naval defeats Mithridates fell back to Pontus. He had also sent troops into Lycaonia and the southern regions of Asia to create support amongst Pisidians and Isaurians, but these were now repelled by the Galatians, under Deiotarus. Lucullus then resumed his original plan and advanced through Galatia and Paphlagonia to Pontus in 72 BC. By 71 BC he was through the Iris and Lycus valleys and into Pontus where he engaged Mithridates at Cabira. The result was disastrous for the Pontic forces, and Mithridates fled to Armenia. The Romans then set about subduing Pontus and Lesser Armenia while trying to persuade Mithridates, now the guest of Tigranes the Great to surrender. Tigranes spurned the Roman overtures and indicated he was prepared to fight, so Lucullus prepared to invade Armenia in 70 BC. In 69 he marched through Cappadocia to the Euphrates, crossing it at Tomisa and entering Sophene and the lands which Tigranes had recently acquired from the Seleucids and heading for the new imperial capital of Tigranocerta. There Tigranes found him besieging the city, and in the ensuing battle, was routed, fleeing northwards.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 233‚Äì240 To proceed further required ensuring the neutrality of the next empire, the Parthians whom Tigranes had also wooed. In 68 BC Lucullus made some advances into northern Armenia but was hampered by the weather and wintered in the south. His strategy had been to dismember Armenia into its former kingdoms. By 67 BC the Roman forces in Pontus were coming increasingly under attack by Mithridates who scored a major victory at Zela. Lucullus' troops were also tiring and becoming dissatisfied. Lucullus withdrew from Armenia but not in time to prevent the defeat at Zela.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 240‚Äì243 The failure of Lucius Licinius Lucullus to rid Rome once and for all of Mithridates brought a lot of opposition at home, some fueled by the great Roman consul Pompey. Lucullus was formally replaced in 67 BC by Marcius Rex, ordered to deal with the Cilician pirate problem, that was threatening the Roman food supply in the Aegean, and Acilius Glabrio to take over the eastern command. Lucullus withdrew back to Galatia and Mithridates promptly recovered all his lost territory. Meanwhile, the republic was changing the administrative governance of Anatolia to the praetorian model in 68 BC. The piracy strategy initiated by Servilius in 78‚Äì75 BC was suspended during the years of fighting Mithridates. Roman naval forces were defeated in 70 BC attempting to deal with the Cretan pirates, and the problem spread to Italy itself. A new model was proposed in 67 BC by Aulus Gabinius that overarched the provincial commands, under Pompey as proconsul. These extraordinary powers were further extended in the next year by the Lex Manilia. In took him only three months during 67 BC to clear the seas. Meanwhile, apprised of the disaster at Zela, there were plans to transfer the command in Anatolia to Pompey, initiated by Gaius Manilius (ably assisted by the oratory of Cicero). The Lex Manilia essentially set aside the new commands of Marcius Rex and Acilius Glabrio. Pompey was granted considerable resources and explicit powers that Lucullus had never had, and command over the entire Anatolian region. Pompey's first move was to persuade the Parthians to harass Tigranes' eastern flank. Following Roman tradition he offered Mithridates terms, but he rejected these. consequently Pompey engaged him at the Battle of Lycus in 66 BC inflicting great losses. Subsequently, Mithridates discovering that Tirganes would no longer support him, fled to Colchis. Pompey, rather than pursue him, turned his attention to Tigranes, who pursued by Parthians surrendered promptly and was granted his inherited but not acquired lands, becoming a client kingdom. Mithridates either committed suicide or was assassinated in 63 BC and Rome added Pontus as a protectorate along with Cilicia as a Roman province. Following the subdual of Armenia Pompey moved on to the Caucasus and the extreme end of Anatolia including Iberia and Albania. By 65 BC he had concluded a truce with the Albanians before sweeping through Iberia and Colchis. He was later to be criticised for not eliminating Mithridates, who had taken refuge in the Crimea. He then completed the subdual of Albania before returning to Pontus and Lesser Armenia where he set about organising the Province of Pontus and Bithynia and the subordinate Anatolian kingdoms during 65‚Äì64 BC. During 64 BC he marched south through Cappadocia and Cilicia to Sytria meeting little opposition except briefly at Commagene. He then annexed Syria as a province, effectively ending the Seleucid Empire now based in Antioch.Cambridge Ancient History vol. ix 243‚Äì244, 248‚Äì259 Anatolia as divided by Pompey, 63 BC.

Mauve: Client states The Roman Republic's policy regarding expansion and overseas territory was frequently conflicted. There were those who were satisfied with diplomacy, creating allies on its borders that acted as buffer states against more distant threats. On the other hand, there were those who saw opportunities for glory and riches. central government in rome was often far from civil and military commanders in the field, and local ambitions often dragged Rome into expanding its frontiers. The military exploits of Lucullus and Pompey towards the end of the Mithridatic wars created an eastern expansion far beyond the vision of the Senate. Policy in Anatolia had consisted of trade, influence and diplomacy with occasional military interventions to maintain the status quo when local kingdoms and empires became expansionist. That influence grew as Rome became the new superpower of the Mediterranean, and repeated interventions reduced many of the kingdoms in Anatolia to client state status. Sometimes Roman rule was forced on the republic by local events such as the bequeathing of kingdoms to Rome. Annexation of territory to form provinces was based on whether there was a trustworthy effective ruler who could rule in the interests of Rome or not.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix. 260 Formal Roman rule began when Attalus III of Pergamon (138‚Äì133 BC) left his kingdom to Rome and it became the Province of Asia, briefly lost during the rebellion of Eumenes III (133‚Äì129 BC) and the early Mithridatic wars (89‚Äì85 BC), its frontiers were strengthened by creating the neighbouring province of Cilicia to its east along the southwestern Mediterranean coast in 78 BC. A further bequest by Nicomedes IV of Bithynia (94‚Äì74 BC) added a neighbour to the northeast along the Black Sea coast, although it took another war before this could be settled properly and combined with its eastern neighbour Pontus to form Bithynia et Pontus in 64 BC. Pompey annexed Syria in the east later that year to provide Roman rule over nearly all the southern coast. Once military conquest had been achieved Pompey set about re-organising internal government within Anatolia,Cambridge Ancient History vol ix. 266‚Äì269 including the all- important collection of taxes.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix. 269‚Äì270 He left Anatolia at the end of 62 BC, returning to Rome in triumph the next year. Thus by Pompey's time the Roman provinces covered the west, north and south of Anatolia. In the centre Galatia were ruled by Brogitarus (63‚Äì50 BC) initially as coruler with his father in law, Deiotarus (105‚Äì40 BC), and then his son Amyntas (36‚Äì25 BC) as a client state. Amyntas initially possessed Lycaonia and successively added Isauria, Pisidia and Cappadocia. In 25 BC, Amyntas died while pursuing enemies in the Taurus mountains, and Rome claimed his lands as a new province, leaving western and central Anatolia completely in Roman hands. In the East the former Armenian kingdoms remained under local rule. While much of Pontus ended up in the new province of Bithynia et Pontus, the east was divided into client kingdoms including Pontus, which continued until the last king, Polemon II (38‚Äì64 AD) was deposed by the Emperor Nero and Pontus became absorbed into the provincial system. Cappadocia continued as an independent client, at one point being united with Pontus, until the Emperor Tiberius deposed the last monarch Archelaus (36 BC ‚Äì 17 AD), creating a province of the same name. Armenia continued as a client state after the Mithridatic wars, torn between Rome and Parthia, eventually becoming a province under the Emperor Trajan in 114 AD. Cilicia was for a short time a separate province (64‚Äì47 BC) before becoming absorbed into Syria. Pompey had enlarged it to include the western Taurus range and the coastal plains beyond it as far as the Amanus Mountains that separate it from Syria. There remained, however, troublesome tribes in the northern mountains that no power had succeeded in subduing.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix. 265‚Äì6 Lycia in the extreme southwest remained independent until 43 AD when it became a province, and was then merged with the Pamphylian region of Galatia to form Lycia et Pamphylia.  The Trumvirates and last years of the Republic 61‚Äì27 BC  In the year's following Pompey's departure the Roman administration in Anatolia kept a wary and at times fearful eye on Parthia on its eastern borders, while the central government in Rome was focussed on Julius Caesar and the events in Western Europe. There followed two centuries of conflict. In 53 BC Marcus Licinius Crassus led an expedition from Syria into Mesopotamia which proved disastrous, the Parthians inflicting huge losses at the Battle of Carrhae in which he was killed. Sporadic raids by the Parthians against Syria continued, but were repelled and suffered a major reversal in 51 BC. However, Crassus' death unbalanced the First Triumvirate of which he was a member, leading to the progressive difficulties between Pompey and Caesar. The Republic's preoccupation with civil war between Pompey and Caesar (49‚Äì45 BC) provided opportunity for further instability in Anatolia. Pharnaces II of Pontus (63‚Äì47 BC) saw an opportunity to expand his realms in violation of his agreement with Pompey, moving into Colchis and Lesser Armenia, then part of Galatia. The Galatians appealed to Caesar, but Pharnaces had already overrun a Roman army at the Battle of Nicopolis in 48 BC, occupying all of Pontus. Caesar, returning from his Egyptian campaign, landed at Antioch and met Pharnaces's forces at Zela in 47 BC and inflicted heavy losses on him, before returning to Rome, uttering the legendary Veni, vidi, vici. Pontus continued under client kings until 17 BC, and Galatia until 25 BC. Meanwhile, Caesar was planning to return to the east and deal with the Parthians who were once again harassing Syria, and avenge Crassius. Plans that were cut short by his assassination in 44 BC.Cambridge Ancient History vol ix. 438 Donations of Alexandria 34 BC With his death, Rome lapsed into yet another war, the Liberators' civil war (43‚Äì42 BC). The conspirators (Liberatores), Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus seized all the eastern provinces. However, their combined forces were destroyed at the Battle of Philippi on the Greek mainland in 42 BC, by those of the Second Triumvirate (Octavian, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and Mark Antony) 43‚Äì33 BC. Following this war Antony remained to govern in the east. There he found himself faced with further Parthian incursions, who had occupied Syria. Between 40 and 38 BC, the parthians penetrated as far as Caria.Cambridge Ancient History x. 645 The Parthians were beaten back following both their 40 and 38 BC invasions. However, when Antony himself decided to invade Parthian territory in 33 BC the result was a disaster, although he made two further expeditions into Armenia. In 34 BC Antony and Cleopatra decided to distribute the eastern lands between their children (Donations of Alexandria), precipitating yet another civil war (32‚Äì30 BC) and the end of the triumvirate. Armenia was granted to Alexander Helios and Syria and Cilicia to Ptolemy Philadelphus, while Antony retained Western Anatolia. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and died the following year. Of the surviving client kingdoms, Cappadocia was the most prominent but was plagued by internal unrest requiring frequent Roman intervention, sometimes for lack of cooperation. At various times it acquired lesser Armenia and parts of Cilicia, and was unified with Pontus.  Roman Empire 27 BC ‚Äì 4th century   The Empire: The Principate 27‚Äì193 AD  The Gate of Augustus in Ephesus, Turkey was built to honor the Emperor Augustus and his family. It led to the commercial area where goods were sold. With Antony dead, and Lepidus marginalised, the second triumvirate was effectively dissolved, leaving Octavian as the sole power. Thus the republic came to and end. Octavian's powers progressively increased, he was granted the title Augustus by the Senate and adopted the title princeps senatus in 27 BC although technically a consul, and shortly after Imperator in effect Emperor and the first phase of the Roman Empire, the Principate (27 BC ‚Äì 284 AD) was born. In exchange for this redistribution of powers, a long history of civil wars came to an end, replaced by the Augustan age (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD). The endless wars had been devastating for Asia Minor.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x 645  Julio- Claudian dynasty 27 BC ‚Äì 68 AD  Under Augustus, Galatia became a formal province in 25 BC strengthening direct Roman rule in western Anatolia, while in 27 BC Cilicia had been absorbed into Syria. Meanwhile, Cappadocia and Armenia continued as client states. A truce of sorts was worked out in 1 AD between the Romans and the Parthians. Augustus and his descendants formed the Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BC ‚Äì 68 AD). Tiberius (14‚Äì37) formed the province of Cappadocia in 17, on the death of the last king, Archelaus (38 BC ‚Äì 17 AD). Claudius (41‚Äì54) dissolved the Lycaean league and organised Lycia into a province in 43. Nero (54‚Äì68) organised the remaining eastern portion of the kingdom of Pontus into a province, after deposing the last king, Polemon II (38‚Äì62). Polemon continued as King of Cilicia until his death. Pontus consisted of three districts: Pontus Galaticus in the west, bordering on Galatia which was incorporated into that territory; Pontus Polemoniacus in the centre, so called from its capital Polemonium, from the Iris to Pharnacia, annexed into Bithynia et Pontus; and Pontus Cappadocicus in the east, bordering on Cappadocia (Armenia Minor), was incorporated into that territory.Smith W (ed.), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography Walton and Maberly, London 1854 ii 659 Armenia continued to be a flashpoint between the Romans and Parthians. War erupted again in 36, and again in 58 under Nero (54‚Äì68). After a disastrous battle of Rhandeia in 62. A compromise was worked out with a Parthian on the Armenian throne subject to Roman approval.  The Year of Four Emperors and Flavian dynasty 69‚Äì96 AD  The Roman Empire 69 AD The Julio-Claudian dynasty ended with Nero's suicide, resulting in a period of instability in 69 until Vespasian (69‚Äì79) ascended, founding the Flavian dynasty. In 72 Vespasian united all the disparate elements of Cilicia into the Roman province, many of which had remained petty dynasties. Vespasian also created a new composite province of Lycia et Pamphylia in 72, out of Claudius' province of Lycia and the Pamphylia region of the province of Galatia.S. ≈ûahin ‚Äì M.

Trajan (98‚Äì117) finally achieved provincialisation of the troubled region of Armenia in 114, albeit for only four years. War with Parthia broke out once again in the 2nd century, generally in Rome's favour. Parthia had broken with previous agreements of choosing Armenian kings subject to approval of Rome. Trajan's policy was to depart from previous policy, invading Armenia, during which the Parthian monarch of Armenia, Parthamasiris, was killed, and going on to create provinces in Mesopotamia and Assyria, and capturing the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. Armenia was now no longer a buffer state. However, the victory was short-lived, Trajan being forced to withdraw to Antioch, and dying shortly afterwards in 117 AD. Trajan's successor, Hadrian (117‚Äì138) decided not to persist with the eastern provinces, and Armenia continued to be a source of conflict in this period. Marcus Aurelius (161‚Äì169) was faced with yet another invasion by Parthia on assuming the Imperial office. The war lasted five years and again the Parthian capital was sacked. A new threat was the Antonine Plague (165‚Äì180) which severely affected Asia.  The Year of Five Emperors and Severan Dynasty 193‚Äì235 AD  The Nerva-Antonine dynasty ended with the assassination of Commodus (177‚Äì192). Commodus' reign ended a period of good government, known as the Five Good Emperors, and is credited with being the beginning of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, following the era of the High Empire (70‚Äì192 AD).Cambridge Ancient History vol. 11 The High Empire, A.D. 70‚Äì192 There followed another period of instability, the Year of Five Emperors, until Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211) became Emperor, initiating the Severan dynasty (193‚Äì235). In 193, the province of Syria was divided by Severus into two sections, Syria Coele in the north, and Syria Phoenicia in the south. Armenia and the Parthians continued to be a problem in the east, with neither side gaining ground in the long term. This time Septimius Severus invaded Mesopotamia in 195 AD, sacking Ctsiphon again (197). Caracalla (198‚Äì217) had some successes, but these were lost under his successor Macrinus (217‚Äì218). However, the Parthian Empire itself was about to come to an end, being overthrown in 224 by the resurgent Persian Empire, a new threat to the eastern empire.  The Empire: the years of crisis 235‚Äì284, Schism 258‚Äì274 and Gothic invasion (255)  Roman Empire 271 AD, after the schism The assassination of Alexander Severus (222‚Äì235), the last of the Severans, brought to an end the Augustan Principate, and the empire descended into its third crisis, this time lasting nearly fifty years. Twenty five emperors obtained power in the space of forty-nine years, with at least fifty one claiming it. Most were either murdered or died in military campaigns against Rome's enemies that were now pressing hard on her frontiers.[Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 28] In addition to instability in governance and civil war the crisis years were marked by hyperinflation, plague and the first schism within the empire. The profound changes between the preceding Principate and succeeding Dominate, coincide with a shift from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. It was also an era in which might of the far flung Roman Empire was now beginning to experience increasing pressure on its eastern and northern borders, whereas previously the balance of military power had concentrated on defending the eastern border.  Persia and the eastern front  During the crisis the eastern provinces felt they were on their own, and were not inclined to help prop up Rome against foreign attacks. The Roman-Parthian wars were now the Roman-Sassanid wars. A Persian invasion starting in 236 in the reign of Gordian III (238‚Äì244) prompted Roman retaliation but in the ensuing battle to secure the eastern borders, the young Gordian was killed and amongst the terms made was the ceding of Armenia to Persia. Persia again attacked in 251, annexing Armenia and invading Syria in the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (251‚Äì253) but were eventually beaten off by the local Roman forces towards the end of his reign. The capture of Nicomedia and Chalcedon by the Goths forced Valerian (253‚Äì260) to move his main troop deployments to Cappadocia, weakening his efforts to contain the Sassanid threat. In the course of these latter campaigns, Valerian became the first Roman emperor to be captured by enemy forces, in 260. The Sassanid forces penetrated as far west as Isauria and Cappadocia. The major part of the Roman response fell to the forces in Syrian outpost, Valerian's successor, Gallienus (260‚Äì268) being preoccupied in the west. Asia Minor then experienced the combined attacks of the Danubian Goths in the Balkans pouring into Thrace, while their Black Sea relatives ravaged coastal cities. A later emperor, Carus (282‚Äì284) led an expedition east to restore Roman rule in Armenia and reverse earlier losses by taking on the Sassanids, but died on the campaign.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 42‚Äì46  Gothic invasion  250px A new problem for Anatolia emerged during this period, with the expansion of the Goths during the 3rd century. Since the roads to central Europe through Macedonia, Italy, and Germania were all defended successfully by the Romans, the Goths found Anatolia to be irresistible due to its wealth and deteriorating defenses. Using a captured fleet of ships from the Bosphorus and flat-bottomed boats to cross the Black Sea, they sailed from Black Sea bases (Black Sea Goths) in 255 during the reign of Valerian (253‚Äì260) around the eastern shores, landing in the coastal city of Trebizond in Pontus. What ensued was a huge embarrassment for Pontus- the wealth of the city was absconded, a larger number of ships were confiscated, and they entered the interior without much resistance. A second invasion of Anatolia through Bithynia brought even more terror inland and wanton destruction. They entered the city of Chalcedon, using it as a base by which to expand their operations, sacking Nicomedia, Prusa, Apamea, and Nicaea in turn. Only the turn of the weather as winter approached kept them from penetrating further into Anatolia. However, the Goths continued their seaborn attacks not only around the coastline of Anatolia, but in Greece and Italy as well. Amongst their raids was the destruction of the Temple of Diana in Ephesus and the city itself in 263. Tacitus (275‚Äì276) successfully took on the Gothic invaders of Anatolia, and this was continued by a subsequent emperor, Probus (276‚Äì82).  Schism, reunification and division  By 258 the empire was breaking up with the defection of the western provinces, to form the Gallic Empire. In 260 the provinces in the east including Syria broke away to form the Palmyrene Empire(260‚Äì273). This stretched all the way to Ancyra, and even attempted to annex Bithynia. Aurelian (270‚Äì275), one of the Illyrian emperors, was an exception to the general pattern in this era, succeeding in re-uniting the empire by 274.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 54‚Äì55 By the time of Carus, the idea of two empires, west and east was emerging. Carus appointed one of his sons, Carinus (282‚Äì285) as co-emperor for the western empire, while he and his other son, Numerian (283‚Äì284) concerned themselves with the east. Numerian died before returning west leaving Carinus to face a newly proclaimed emperor, Diocletian, who subsequently triumphed.  The Empire: The Dominate 284 ‚Äì 4th century   The Tetrarchy and first Eastern Empire 284‚Äì324  Roman Empire under the First Tetrarchy showing the three Dioceses of the Eastern Empire Order and stability was restored when Diocletian (284‚Äì305) obtained power following the death of the last Crisis Emperors, Numerian (282‚Äì284), and overcoming his brother Carinus, ushering in the next and final phase of the Roman Empire, The Dominate. Diocletian managed to secure the frontiers and instituted sweeping administrative reforms that affected all the provinces, preparing them for the new millennia and the transition to the Early Middle Ages. He continued Carus' tradition by instituting a system of Tetrarchs, and dividing the responsibility for the empire between them. The term Augustus became the name of senior emperors, while junior emperors were known as Caesar. In the initial arrangement, or Diarchy, Diocletian entrusted the west to his junior Caesar (later Augustus) Maximian while he took charge of the east. = First Tetrarchy 293‚Äì305 = This evolved into a tetrachy in 293, the empire being divided into four, but each Caesar reporting to an Augustus. The new co-emperors were Galerius and Constantius, forming the First Tetrarchy (293‚Äì305). Thus Diocletian and Maximian were the Augusti (senior emperors) with Galerius and Constantius as Caesares (junior emperors). There were now four Tetrarchic Capitals, with the east being governed from Nicomedia in Bithynia (now Izmit), where he had originally been proclaimed emperor.Cambridge Ancient History vol xii 58 This became the base for defence against invasion from the Balkans and Persia's Sassanids and Diocletian's capital. In the Diocletian reforms provinces were divided into smaller units, almost doubling the total number soon after 293, replicating the original regions of Asia Minor. Asia was divided into seven smaller provinces, and Bithynia three (Bithynia, Honorias and Paphlagonia). Galatia lost its northern and southern parts to the new provinces of Paphlagonia and Lycaonia, respectively. Lycia et Pamphylia was once again split into its two constituent units. Cappadocia lost its Pontic and Lesser Armenian territories. Another innovation was the establishment of Dioceses, an intermediate administrative structure that combined together several provinces, although Cicero used the term when he was governor of Cilicia (51 BC). Anatolia was restructured into three dioceses, which were eventually grouped under the Praetorian Prefecture of the East (praefectura praetorio Orientis); Asia (Asiana), Pontus (Pontica) and East (Oriens). (see navbox below)Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 76 Armenia returned to the Roman sphere in 287 as a vassal state under Tiridates III (287‚Äì330) and more formally as protectorate in 299. On the eastern front, Persia renewed hostilities in 296, inflicting losses on Galerius'forces, until Diocletian brought in new troops from further west the following year and clashed with the Persians in lesser Armenia, and pursued them all the way to Ctesiphon in 298, effectively ending the campaign.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 81‚Äì83 = Second Tetrarchy 305‚Äì308 = In 305, both Augusti stepped down, an unprecedented constitutional step, the agreement being that both Caesares would be promoted to Augusti, and new Caesares appointed. This happened but the expected new Caesares were not, as expected, the sons of former emperors, Maxentius (son of the now retired Augustus Maximian) and Constantine (son of the new Augustus Constantius), but rather Flavius Valerius Severus and Maximinus. Galerius was now Augustus of the East and the Second Tetrarchy was formed with Constantius and Galerius as Augusti and Severus and Maximinus as Caesares, and heirs apparent. This oversight was to prove fatal to Diocletian's vision of a tetrarchy.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 87‚Äì88 Constantius died in 306 and Galerius raised Severus to Augustus as expected. However, Constantine, who would have been eligible for the vacant role of Caesar, was elected as Augustus by his troops, in competition with Severus, while Maxentius the other overlooked candidate for Caesar simultaneously challenged Severus and indeed deposed and murdered him, declaring himself Augustus, while his father Maximian also attempted to return to power and take the role of Augustus. This left multiple candidates for the Tetrarchical roles. = Third Tetrarchy and Civil War 308‚Äì313 = In 308 Galerius and Diocletian attempted a diplomatic solution, summoning an Imperial Conference that elected Licinius as Augustus of the West, with Constantine as his Caesar, while the incumbents, Galerius and Maximinus continued in the east, as a Third Tetrarchy. this proved unworkable and both Maxentius and Constantine, originally overlooked as Caesares continued to stake their claims, and by 309 they became full Augusti and the empire dissolved into civil war between 309 and 313. Relative to the western parts of the empire, the eastern empire was stable. The transition from Diocletian to Galerius proceeded smoothly in 305. Upon assuming the role of Augustus, Galerius assigned Maximinus to Egypt and Syria. On Galerius'death in 311, Maximinus divided the east seizing Asia Minor, with Licinius as western Augustus. When Maximinus fell out with Licinius, he crossed the Bosphorus, took Byzantium and engaged the latter in 313 at Tzirallum in Thrace, at which he was routed, but was pursued across Asia Minor to Tarsus by Licinius. = Diarchy 313‚Äì324 = At the end of the wars there remained two empires and two emperors. Constantine had disposed of Maxentius in 312 and agreed to repartition the empire, with Constantine in the west and Licinius in the East. Licinius was immediately engaged in dealing with the Persian situation. By the following year (314) the two emperors were at war, which simmered over a decade. Constantine eventually besieged Licinius in Byzantium in 324, defeated his fleet at the Battle of Hellespont. Licinius fell back on Bithynia, where he surrendered at the Battle of Chrysopolis. Constantine then declared himself sole emperor of a reunited empire (324‚Äì337).  The Late Empire 324‚Äì425   Constantinian dynasty 324‚Äì363  At the end of the 3rd century, the vast empire was beset by administrative and fiscal problems, and much of the power lay in the hands of the military, while there was no clear principle of succession and dynasties were short lived, their fate often determined by force of arms rather than legitimacy. The empire was divided culturally with Latin predominating in the west, and Greek in the east, while eastern ideas, such as Mithraism were spreading (including Constantine and his family). Another increasing cultural force was the Palestinian religion of Christianity, although demonstrating considerable heterogeneity of orthodoxy. Diocletian had carried out major reforms after the years of crisis, but the empire slipped into chaos once again on his abdication and it fell to Constantine to restore stability and continue the process of reform. From the time of Constantine I's accession in 324 to the death of Julian in 363, the empire was ruled by the Constantinian dynasty (Neo-flavians). = Constantine I 324‚Äì337 = Constantine I, later referred to as Constantine the Great, ruled from 324 to 337 and his career was dominated by two considerations, the role of religion in the empire and the need for an Eastern capital. Because his reign coincided with the spread of Christianity his life has been obscured by legend as the first Christian emperor.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 90‚Äì92 In Diocletian's reign, Constantine was a regular visitor to the court at Nicomedia, and again under Galerius. At the end of the civil wars in 324 he once again found himself in Bithynia. Successive Roman emperors were becoming dissatisfied with Rome as an administrative centre, with its traditions which were at odds with their new more Eastern ways, and far from the theatres of war that consumed them. Many of them had spent little time in Rome and had created centres for themselves elsewhere.Runciman, Steven (1933). Byzantine Civilization. Methuen, London Helena of Constantinople by Cima da Conegliano Constantine considered a number of candidate cities as a new eastern capital, before deciding on Byzantium in 330, initially designated Nova Roma (New Rome), but then Constantinopolis in Constantine's honour (although its official title remained Nova Roma Constantinopolitana). Byzantium had long been considered of strategic importance, guarding the access from the Black Sea to the Aegean. Various emperors had either fortified or dismantled its fortifications depending on which power was using it and for what. Byzantium featured in Constantine's last war against Licinius in which Constantine had besieged the city, and after the war was over he further investigated its potential. He set about renewing the city almost immediately, inaugurating it in 330. This is a year sometimes picked as the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. The new capital was to be distinguished from the old by being simultaneously Christian and Greek (although was initially mainly Latin speaking like its Balkan hinterland) and a centre of culture. Constantine's major contribution to religion in the empire was to summon the elders of the Christian world to the great Council of Nicaea in 325 to resolve differences and establish orthodoxy, such as the date of Easter.Cambridge Ancient History vol. xii 98 The other great influence was his mother, Helena who set about re-establishing the sacred sites of Palestine. Constantine's administrative reforms included restructuring of the Praetorian prefectures. Under Diocletian, there were two prefectures, one per Augustus, as their Grand Vizier, or Chief of Staff. In the civil wars that followed with multiple competing emperors, they proliferated. Constantine divided the civil duties of the prefect from the military, by creating separate offices of magister peditum and magister equitum as well as magister officiorum. The prefect was now purely a civil administrator. By 332 there were five prefectures, anticipating he division of the empire after his death. Some provincial boundaries were changed. In c. 330 Cappadocia lost its eastern portions which became two components of Lesser Armenia, namely Armenia prima and Armenia secunda. During his reign, conflict with the Persians over Armenia persisted and he was planning a major campaign at the time of his death. Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by Constantine I: from west to east, the territories of Constantine II, Constans I, Dalmatius and Constantius II. = Constantine's successors = Constantine I's succession was complicated being succeeded by three of his sons simultaneously; Constantine II (337‚Äì340), Constantius II (337‚Äì361) and Constans (337‚Äì350). They immediately set about carving up Constantine's empire, together with their cousin Dalmatius, Anatolia falling to Constantius II. Constantius rarely visited Constantinople being preoccupied with the eastern front, amongst other wars. During Constantius' reign the Praetorian prefecture of the East was established, incorporating the eastern dioceses, with its headquarters in Constantinople, By 350 both of Constantius II's brothers had died and the empire was reunited under him. Constantius continued the tradition of appointing Caesares, from his cousins. Of those Gallus was appointed to rule the eastern provinces (351‚Äì354) until Constantius had him killed. The other was Julian who was acclaimed emperor in 360 in competition with Constantius. However, the latter died before overt conflict broke out, and Julian ascended the throne (361‚Äì363). Although Julian's reign was relatively brief, his desire to return the empire to traditional gods earned him the nickname of Apostate. He was also noted for his purging of the civil service. He died campaigning in the east. With Julian's death, the short Constantinian dynasty came to an end. Very few Roman dynasties lasted more than three generations. These were turbulent times, but from the rule of Augustus (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD) until that of Constantine I (306‚Äì337 AD), Anatolia enjoyed relative peace that allowed itself to grow as a region. Augustus removed all debts owed to the Roman Empire by the provinces and protectorates, making advanced progress possible. Roads were built to connect the larger cities in order to improve trade and transportation, and the abundance of high outputs in agricultural pursuits made more money for everyone involved. Settlement was encouraged, and local governors did not place a heavy burden upon the people with regards to taxation. The wealth gained from peace and prosperity prevented great tragedy as powerful earthquakes tore through the region, and help was given from the Roman government and other parties. It was also an age that produced some of the most respected scientific men of the classical period including the philosopher Dio of Bithynia, the physician Galen of Pergamon, and the historians Memnon of Heraclea and Cassius Dio of Nicaea.  Jovian and the Valentinians 363‚Äì378  Upon Julian's death, a military commander in his army, Jovian (363‚Äì364) was chosen as the new emperor. He was not connected to Constantine's family and his brief reign was notable for re-establishing Christianity and for making a settlement with the Persians that was very much in their favour. He in turn was succeeded by Valentinian I (364‚Äì375), another soldier and founder of the Valentinianic dynasty, who almost immediately divided the empire again, moving to the west leaving the east in the hands of his brother Valens (364‚Äì378). Valens preoccupied himself with the east only to discover a Constatinian usurper Procopius had declared himself emperor resulting in a civil war. In the ensuing Battle of Thyatira in Phrygia in 366, Procopius was captured and killed. Valens was faced with war on two fronts, with the Goths in the Balkans with whom he made a hasty peace in 369, so he could deal with the Persian attacks on Armenia. His problems were compounded by a revolt in Isauria, attacks by the Saracens on Syria, and having to send troops to help with the wars against the Barbarians in the west. He had made his capital, Antioch, but found conditions in the East deteriorating again with the Goths pouring into Thrace. In 378 Valens decided to confront them without waiting for reinforcements from the west mmeeting the invading army at the Battle of Adrianople. At the end of the battle Valens and much of his army lay dead. Valens split Cappadocia, already much diminished into two provinces, Cappadocia prima in the north and Cappadocia secunda in the southwest around Tyana. For a brief time the empire was reunited (378‚Äì9) under the western emperor Gratian (375‚Äì383), son of Valentinian I and nephew of Valens, before he realised he needed someone to rule in the east separately, dispatching his brother in law, Theodosius I (379‚Äì395), to Constantinople. In the west the Valentinians continued in power until the death of Valentinian III (425‚Äì455).  Theodosian dynasty 378‚Äì455  Roman Empire at final division 395 AD, showing Prefectures Diocese of Asia 400 AD Diocese of Pontus 400 AD Diocese of the East 400 AD Since Theodosius I (379‚Äì395) was only related to the Valentinians through marriage, he is regarded as the founder of a separate Theodosian dynasty. Like Constantine he is remembered in history as both Great and Saint. He was also the last emperor to rule over both east and west. He continued the tradition of co-rulers, appointing his son Arcadius as co-ruler (383‚Äì395). The situation in the west was extremely complex. On the death of Valentinian I in 375, Gratian (375‚Äì383) his son acceded to the throne but Valentinian I's generals proclaimed his four-year-old brother Valentinian II (375‚Äì392) necessitating a further division of the western empire. Gratian was killed in 383, by the usurper Magnus Maximus (383‚Äì388). Once Theodosius had disposed of him in 388, he was again sole ruler (388‚Äì393), Valentinian II only being 17, but technically a co-ruler with a guardian. However, he died in 392, whereupon another usurper, Eugenius appeared (392‚Äì394). Theodosius then appointed another son Honorius (394‚Äì423) in the place of Valentinian, although he was only eight years old. Theodosius then disposed of Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus in 394. Theodosius's major problems were with the Goths and his western frontier, which kept him away from Constantinople. He became notorious for his perpetration of the Massacre of Thessalonica in 390, and had to deal with all the problems going on in the west (see above). On the eastern front he came to an arrangement with the Sassenids in 384 over Armenia establishing a firm frontier, but essentially agreeing to give up most of Greater Armenia. This arrangement proved relatively stale over a long time. The Eastern frontier with Persia in 384 AD Despite all these events he was able to contribute considerably to Anatolian life. The great obelisk that he had transported from Alexandria to Constantinople in 390 still stands today. He rebuilt Constantine's great Forum in 393 and today it also bears his name. He also played a part in religious life, issuing an edict in 380 that established the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria as the official version of Christianity, that was still very heterogeneous. He was baptised and appointed the Patriarch of Constantinople. Then in 381 he continued Constantine's work in Nicaea by calling a new ecumenical council in Constantinople to entrench orthodoxy and repair relations with Rome. During the 4th century, most of the provinces making up the Diocese of the East were split in two, e.g. Cilicia I, Cilicia II. The Armenian situation was complex. In the west (west of the Euphrates) lay the older territory of Lesser Armenia, within the Diocese of Pontus, being lands most recently acquired from Cappadocia, and forming two provinces, Armenia prima and Armenia secunda. In the east there were also two territories. In the North lay Armenia maior had provincial status, while the southern part consisted of a federation of six satrapies or principalities (Ingilene, Sophene, Anzitene, Asthianene, Sophanene and Balabitene) allied to the empire. Theodosius died in Milan in 395, and was buried in Constantinople. His sons Honorius and Arcadius divided the empire between them and it was never again to be united. Thus the Eastern Empire was finally established by the beginning of the 5th century, as it entered the Middle Ages, while the west was to decay and Rome to be sacked under Honorius. The west limped on under a series of short lived emperors and progressively shrinking empire, in which the east frequently intervened, effectively ending with Julius Nepos (474‚Äì475).  Judaism and Christianity in Anatolia during Roman times  As the Roman Empire grew geographically it became increasingly diverse and the influence of many religions beyond the traditional Roman values was increasingly felt. Slowly a movement for religious tolerance developed.  Judaism  Jewish legend describes Jewish dispersion from as early as the Book of Genesis and the time of Abraham. Although there may have been some settlement in the 4th century BC this was substantial before the time of the Seleucids. In about 210 BC, Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire relocated 2,000 families of Jews from Babylonia to Lydia and Phrygia, and this migration continued throughout the remainder of the Empire's existence.Josephus, \\"Ant.\\" xii. 3, ¬ß 4 The principal centres were Apamea, Laodicea on the Lycus, and Hierapolis Euphratensis. Additional clues to the size of the Jewish influence in the area were provided by Cicero, who noted that a fellow Roman governor had halted the tribute sent to Jerusalem by Jews in 66 BC, and the record of Ephesus, where the people urged Agrippa to expel Jews because they were not active in their religious activities. The Romans provided some protection to Jewish communities after they occupied Anatolia in 188 BC. The existing Hellenistic communities were not favourably disposed to the distinct culture in their midst and initiated discriminatory measures. In contrast the emperors promised freedom of religious practice. Jewish communities in the area collected monies to send to Jerusalem. There was more assimilation and even hybrid religious practices. In the Common Era (AD) the Jewish communities were more accepted in the Hellenistic world, but (other than in Cappadocia) the ties with Judaea were weakening. Christianity made little impact on Judaism in Anatolia before the making of it a state religion.Wilson, Michael. Cilicia:The First Christian Churches in Anatolia. Tyndale Bulletin 54.1 (2003) 15‚Äì30.Ephesus, Jewish EncyclopediaAsia Minor, Jewish Encyclopedia  Christianity  We have very little information regarding the spread of Christianity from the events recorded in Palestine in the gospels to the Flavians (69‚Äì96 AD), other than the life and works of St Paul recorded in the New Testament.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x p. 851 = The 1st century = Paul came originally from Tarsus in Cilicia, but spent much of his early life in Jerusalem. Early accounts suggest a community practising in Antioch, and likely elsewhere in Syria and neighbouring Palestine, where Paul spent some time.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x p. 853 The following was predominantly an urban phenomenon. The Acts of the Apostles, our primary source suggests that converts were predominantly amongst the Jewish population, the Gentile following in Syria being the exception.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x p. 855 Following the account of the Acts of the Apostles, we must rely on the various letters of Paul included in the New Testament, of which a number were to Anatolian churches (e.g. Galatians, Ephesians). From sources such as the Letter to the Galatians we learn that Paul spent a considerable time in the vicinity of his home town of Tarsus in Cilicia and that the church there was linked to the Syrian churches. Put together these various Pauline sources suggest considerable missionary activity by Paul and Barnabas throughout Anatolia, and adherence to the new faith in both Jewish and hellenised Gentile society. He appears to have made Ephesus, the metropolis of the province of Asia, his headquarters (54-56AD).Cambridge Ancient History vol. x p. 857 Another New Testament source, the Revelation refers to the Seven Churches of Asia (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamon, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea), a list which includes not only large urban centres but also smaller towns. Certainly Asia Minor appears to have been the centre of Christianity at least until the late 40s, before spreading across the Aegean and eventually Rome itself.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x p. 858 Paul noted that \\"all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word\\" and verified the existence of a church in Colossae as well as Troas. Later he received letters from MagnesiaEarly Christian Writings: Ignatius ‚Äì The Epistle to the Magnesians and Tralleis, both of which already had churches, bishops, and official representatives who supported Ignatius of Antioch in the 2nd century.Cambridge Ancient History vol. x pp. 853, 858 Even other non-Christians started to take notice of the new religion. In 112 the Roman governor in Bithynia writes to the Roman emperor Trajan that so many different people are flocking to Christianity, leaving the temples vacated. == See also == *History of Anatolia *Prehistory of Anatolia *Ancient Regions of Anatolia *Ancient kingdoms of Anatolia *Medieval states in Anatolia == References  Sources ==  Reference works  *Cambridge Ancient History Online 14 vols. 1970‚Äì2000 Note: The original 11 vol Cambridge Ancient History 1928‚Äì36 is now available as free ebooks *Cambridge Companions to the Ancient World. 10 vols. *Hastings, James.

It was interpreted by good actors, the play was performed for eleven days but considered inferior to Douglas, another Home's play. The Drury Lane cast featured David Garrick as Lysander, Henry Mossop as Agis, William Havard as Amphares, Thomas Davies as Euxus, Charles Holland as Reusus, Hannah Pritchard as Ageistrata, Mary Ann Yates as Sandane and Susannah Cibber as Euathane.Hogan p.647 ==References * Agis A Tragedy on Google plays ==Bibliography== * Nicoll, Allardyce.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Preston, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with those of St Martin, Fulwood, and St Peter, Fulwood. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. ==History== The tower of the church is dated 1533. The rest of the church, which dated possibly as far back as the 14th century, was demolished in about 1823. The nave was rebuilt between 1823 and 1826. The architect for this work was Robert Roper. In 1905‚Äì06 the chancel, vestries, and an organ chamber were added by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. At the same time the whole building was restored, and the box pews were replaced by benches. ==Architecture== Exterior St John's is constructed in sandstone, and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, a north porch, a chancel with an organ chamber to the south, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with diagonal buttresses, an embattled parapet and a southwest stair turret. On the west side of the tower is a doorway, above which is a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery. In the top stage are three-light louvred bell openings, and small gargoyles near the corners. A string course below the parapet carries the date 1533 on the south side. The nave is in Early English style, and has a large lancet window in each bay, the bays being separated by shallow buttresses. The chancel and organ chamber are in Perpendicular style, with square-headed windows, and an embattled parapet. The east window has three lights. In the gable of the organ chamber are re-set stones dating from the 16th century carved with the shields and initials of local families. Interior The font consists of a large rough bowl, whose date is unknown. Also in the church is a brass chandelier dated 1817. The stained glass in the chancel consists of a scheme of the 1930s by Powells. Also in the church are windows of 1952 by A. F. Erridge, of 1985 by Jane Gray, and of 1999 by Halton Stained Glass. The monuments include a fragment dated 1714, and a brass dated 1908. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1906 by Henry Ainscough of Preston at a cost of ¬£800 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). It was repaired in 1928 and overhauled in 1941. Additions to the organ were made in 1967 and in 1980 by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1884 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. ==External features== In or near the churchyard are three structures listed at Grade II. To the south of the church is a sundial dating probably from the 18th century. It consists of an octagonal pedestal on a square base, with a brass plate and a scrolled gnomon. Beside the south gate is a two-step mounting block dating from the 18th century or earlier. Nearby are village stocks dating probably from the 18th century. These were restored in 1902 to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII. The churchyard itself contains the war graves of three British Army personnel of World War I, and two of World War II. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Lancashire *Listed buildings in Broughton, Lancashire *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) ==References *Broughton church choir Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Diocese of Blackburn Category:Grade II* listed churches in Lancashire Category:English Gothic architecture in Lancashire Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Churches in Preston ","title":"St John the Baptist's Church, Broughton"},{"id":"35273871","text":"Allan L. Goldstein is Emeritus Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine. He chaired the department from 1978 until March 2009 and was awarded Emeritus status in 2013. He is an authority on the thymus gland and the workings of the immune system, and co-discoverer (with Abraham White) of the Thymosins, a family of hormone-like peptides isolated from the thymus gland. ==Early life and education== Goldstein grew up on Staten Island and received his B.S. degree from Wagner College in 1959 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rutgers University, the latter in 1964. He served on the faculty of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 1964 to 1972, and as Director of the Division of Biochemistry at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston from 1972 through 1978 before accepting the Chairmanship of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences, a position he held for 31 years. ==Research== Thymosin Œ±1 (TA1), a molecule with immune enhancing properties, was the first of the Thymosins to enter clinical trials. It has been approved in China and more than 30 other countries, and has shown great promise in the treatment of severe sepsis, cancer, and a number of other diseases including the potential treatment of cystic fibrosis. Most recently, TA1 has been found to synergize with a check-point inhibitor and further extend the survival of Stage III/IV melanoma patients previously treated with TA1. Thymosin Œ≤4 (TŒ≤4), the second of the Thymosins to reach the clinic, has been shown to accelerate wound healing and the remodeling of injured tissues. An injectable form of TŒ≤4 has been developed for internal indications such as myocardial infarction, stroke and brain trauma. Early Phase 2 trials have been completed in patients with pressure and venostasis ulcers. Two Phase 2/3 trials in patients with dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy have been completed in the United States with promising results. A third Phase 3 trial in dry eye will begin in 2019. RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals is developing an injectable form of TŒ≤4 for internal indications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, and peripheral neuropathy. Dr. Goldstein's research has helped define the role of biological response modifiers in health and disease, and has led to the discovery of important new links between the immune system, the neuroendocrine system and the brain. ==Academic achievements== Dr. Goldstein is the author of more than 450 scientific articles in professional journals, the inventor on over 25 U.S. and worldwide patents, and the editor of several books and monographs in the fields of biochemistry,Goldstein, A.L.

The National Foundation, Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, l978. Over the years, Dr. Goldstein's laboratory has been a center for the training of graduate, medical, and postdoctoral students, many of whom are now continuing and expanding his studies on the role of the thymus in health and disease. Dr. Goldstein has also been a pioneer in medical education, having developed a unique series of distance-education programs presented on the Internet entitled Frontiers in Medicine. This series of lectures and National Town Forums by leading scientists focused on cutting- edge research. The broadcasts, which were presented live from The George Washington University, began in 1997 and were a first for continuing medical education on the Internet. Frontiers in Medicine received the FREDDIE award for best health site at the 1997 American Medical Association Health and Medicine film competition in San Francisco. ==Professional activities== Dr. Goldstein was the co-founder and first President and Scientific Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Aging and Geriatric Medicine, a nonprofit research institute that supports research and educational activities. He also served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Albert Sabin Vaccine Institute and of the Board of Directors of the Richard B. and Lynn V. Cheney Cardiovascular Institute. Currently, he serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientific Advisor for RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, a public company developing novel wound-healing and remodeling therapeutics. ==Honors== Dr. Goldstein is the recipient of several awards, including the Career Scientist Award of the Health Research Council, City of New York; the Van Dyke Memorial Award in Pharmacology from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons; the Copernicus Medal from the University of Krak√≥w; a citation from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare \\"in recognition and appreciation of outstanding work in helping to establish a national program on Biological Response Modifiers\\"; a Doctor of Science Degree (Honoris Causa) from Wagner College; the Decoration of the Order of Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, in the rank of Commander, Panama's highest honor, for \\"contributions directed to the preservation of human life in the world\\"; the Distinguished Researcher Award of the George Washington University School of Medicine, and the Chevalier des Palmes Acad√©miques, the highest civilian award of France.

Its sole purpose was to support the fortification with cannons thus creating additional defense for the Azov Flotilla. ==History== The islet was built by the personal order of Peter the Great in 1701-1706 of rock fill held by oak piles. It was oval- shaped and measured 59 by 38 meters. There was a citadel, which had an area of 1200 square meters with 127 cannons. In the middle stood a wooden izba for garrison, which was later replaced by a stone building. The part of the islet above water level was covered with white limestones. The name Cherepakha (the Turtle) is due to the many seashells laid in its foundation when the sand bank was being raised. After a defeat suffered by Russian troops from Ottoman Empire during Pruth River Campaign, the Russian tsar had to sign Treaty of the Pruth, returning Azov to Turkey and destroying both Taganrog Fortress and Cherepakha Islet. On September 19, 1711 by the order of Peter the Great, Taganrog was demolished and in February 1712 Russian troops left the town. After the next Russo-Turkish war, the Treaty of Ni≈° was signed stipulating the return of the territory to Russia but without the right to reconstruct the Taganrog Fortress. In 1746 a Russian customs post was established on the cape Tagan-Rog and a patrol was placed on Cherepakha Islet. In the late 18th century the city of Taganrog lost its military and strategic importance and the citadel was not reconstructed. In 1776 a temporary quarantine control was established on the islet. In 1845 a wooden lighthouse was mounted on Cherepakha, which was in its turn replaced by a metal lighthouse in 1894. In the present days, when the tide is low and blows East wind, the islet emerges from the water.

It later served as a museum and archive. The building was severely damaged by bombs during the last weeks of World War II and largely demolished afterwards. Currently a Verein is working to maintain and reconstruct the remaining eastern wing. ==History==  Previous structures The first castle in Zerbst was a Slavic water castle constructed in the 12th century. This structure was first mentioned in a document dated 1196 and consisted of a front castle and a main castle, both surrounded by a wall and a moat. The free-standing bell tower, which today is considered part of the adjacent St. Bartholomew church, was originally part of this castle. Over the centuries, the castle was expanded and renovated. By the 16th century, the complex consisted of a number of individual residences for the various family branches, surrounded by a common castle wall. In 1603, an expensive repair project was initiated, because the castle was in an almost derelict state. The high castle tower was demolished in 1618. The castle survived the Thirty Years' War almost undamaged. However, during the next century maintenance of the building was neglected and by the end of the 17th century the building was largely uninhabitable.  Residence of the House of Anhalt-Zerbst  Prince Charles William decided to build a modern building as his residence and commissioned the Dutch architect Cornelis Ryckwaert to design this palace. To make room, the northern parts of the old castle were demolished, and the resulting debris was used as backfill in the foundation of the new palace. The southern parts of the old castle were partially integrated into the new palace. The plan was to create a typical Baroque three-wing complex with a cour d'honneur in the center, which was based stylistically on Dutch models. The foundation were laid on 31 May 1681. The shell of the corps de logis was completed in 1689; work on decorations and extensions continued until 1696. The main building of the castle was inaugurated on 23 June 1696. The cost for the project were estimated at this time at . Between 1703 and 1706, Ryckwaert's successor Giovanni Simonetti built the west wing, which included the castle chapel. Construction work on the chapel continued until 1719. In 1721, the central avant-corps was expanded into a castle tower with a Baroque dome. In 1743, the last parts of the old castle were demolished and in 1744, construction of the east wing was begun in the space thus freed. With the completion of the shell of the east wing in 1746, the palace arrived at its intended three-wing from. The new wing was decorated in Frederician Rococo style. It was a childhood home of Catherine the Great (born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst) prior to being selected to marry the heir of the Russian Imperial throne in 1744. Construction was halted when in 1758, the ruling Prince Frederick Augustus, Catherine the Great's younger brother, had to flee to Basel due to a dispute with Frederick the Great. At this time, the outside of the east wing had been completed, but the second floor had not been decorated. It would remain in that state until the Castle Museum moved in 1921. Later history Schloss Zerbst before its destruction After the Anhalt-Zerbst line of the princely family died out in 1793, the castle mostly stood empty. In 1872, the State Archives and the Ducal House Archive were housed in the corps de logis. In 1881, the tower was destroyed by fire. It was subsequently restored in its old form. In 1921, the Castle Museum was opened in the castle, and some municipal offices, including the town's tax offices, were housed in the empty rooms. The \\"riding school\\", now an indoor arena On 16 April 1945, the castle was hit by Allied bombs and burned out completely. The valuable interior was destroyed, as well as the exhibits on display in the museum and the documents held in the State Archives. Reconstructing the walls of the castle on the existing foundations would have been possible, but this option was rejected for political reasons by the Communist rulers of post-War Eastern Germany. The corps de logis and the west wing were demolished and only the ruins of the east wing were left standing. ==Description== Several reminders of the size and appearance of the castle are still present in the castle grounds. Immediately adjacent to the castle is the former riding school, a Baroque building constructed in 1724, that once served as an indoor arena and is now an indoor event space. Parts of the castle park and some outbuildings remain. The park was created around 1798 as a French formal garden and was later transformed into a landscaped park. The reason for this transformation was that the old Baroque structural elements and lawns were long left to fend for themselves and the original structure was no longer visible. Of the Schloss itself, only the eastern wing and part of the corps de logis remain today. == Reconstruction == Schloss Zerbst eastern wing in 2017, with partially secured windows and roof In 2006, the friends of Zerbst Castle began securing and reconstructing the ruins.

Citadel President Lt. Gen. George M. Seignious stressed that his departure had nothing to do with basketball, the coach, or the team.

He is known for his books on Riesz spaces (together with Wim Luxemburg). ==Biography== Zaanen was born in Rotterdam, where he attended the Hogere Burgerschool. He graduated in 1930 with excellent marks, and started his studies in mathematics at Leiden University. Having obtained his master's degree in 1935, he did research under the guidance of his doctoral advisor Johannes Droste, and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1938. His doctoral thesis dealt with the convergence of series of eigenvalues of boundary value problems of the Sturm‚ÄìLiouville type. The same year he was appointed a mathematics teacher at the Hogere Burgerschool in Rotterdam, a profession that he continued until 1947. In the next years and also in the difficult period of the German occupation of the Netherlands, Zaanen continued to do mathematical research in his spare time. He studied Stefan Banach's Th√©orie des Op√©rations Lin√©aires, the book that laid the foundations of functional analysis, and Marshall H. Stone's Linear Transformations in Hilbert Space. During this period he wrote nine scientific papers on integral equations with symmetrisable kernels that were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946-47. In parallel to his job as a secondary-school teacher, Zaanen was appointed in 1946 as a mathematics teacher for three hours per week at the Technische Hogeschool Delft, and as an unpaid privaatdocent at Leiden University where he taught a course on Lebesgue integration. In 1947 Zaanen accepted the position of Professor of Mathematics at the Technische Hogeschool Bandoeng. In 1950 he returned to the Netherlands where he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Technische Hogeschool Delft. In these years he continued his work on the book Linear Analysis, which was published in 1953 and for years was a prominent work on functional analysis and the theory of integral equations. In 1956 Zaanen was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Leiden University. There he started a large research programme into the theory of Riesz spaces, together with his first doctoral student Wim Luxemburg, Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. Most of their results were published in a series of papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Unusually for mathematics research in the Netherlands at the time, Zaanen pursued a long-term research programme involving a number of collaborators and doctoral students. Eight doctoral theses on various topics in the theory of Riesz spaces were produced in this school. Zaanen took retirement in 1982. ==Publications== Zaanen published almost 70 papers in scientific journals and reviewed conference proceedings. He is however best known for four large books that each took a prominent place in scientific literature: * A.C. Zaanen, Linear Analysis, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam and P. Noordhoff, Groningen (1953, 1957, 1960), 600 pages * Adriaan Cornelis Zaanen, Integration, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam (1967) 604 pages.

Zaanen, Riesz Spaces II, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam New York Oxford (1983), 720 pages ==Other functions and honours== Zaanen was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. He served as President of the Dutch Mathematical Society from 1970 until 1972. He was an editor of the Society's journal Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde from 1953 until 1982. In 1988 he was appointed an honorary member of the Society. He served as a member of the Curatorium of the Mathematisch Centrum from 1965 until 1979. On his retirement in 1982 Zaanen was appointed Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Dutch mathematicians Category:Leiden University alumni Category:Delft University of Technology faculty Category:Leiden University faculty Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:People from Rotterdam Category:Knights of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Category:Functional analysts ","title":"Adriaan Cornelis Zaanen"},{"id":"35274197","text":"Zaanen is a surname.

Unite represents around 2,000 tanker drivers, who deliver fuel to 90% of Britain's forecourts. Although no strike took place, Government action precipitated panic-buying and a woman was very seriously injured after following a minister's advice to store extra petrol. ==Background== Towards the end of 2007, fuel prices exceeded ¬£1 per litre with a two-pence rise in fuel tax in October, resulting in the highest diesel prices and the fourth highest for petrol in Europe. New protests were planned by two unconnected groups, one called Transaction 2007 and the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA is currently headed by Chief Executive Mr Geoff Dunning. Protesters claimed that forecourts and oil firms were profiteering. Tanker drivers also claimed felt that they were being neglected and over worked. They were also concerned about the outsourcing in the haulage industry has triggered relentless pressure on cutting costs, with firms likes of Asda, Shell and Esso all contracting out their deliveries to low quality rivals. Union representatives and tanker drivers revealed that some vehicles can weigh 44 tonnes and can carry around 36,000 to 40,000 litres of fuel. Some drivers can start at two in the morning and work until two in the afternoon, with one weekend off every 14 weeks. News of the planned industrial action days after George Osborne had outlined the imposition of 20 per cent VAT on hot pies, more public sector cuts, council workers' pension cuts and the planned NHS reforms in mid-March. The Panic buying at forecourts across the UK in March 2012 began after Unite members threatened to vote to strike. According to their critics (including the AA), both statements from UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Cabinet Minister Francis Maude, and poor media coverage, encouraged tens of thousands of motorists to panic buy, leading to a number of forecourts running out of fuel. Unite members must legally give seven days' prior notification of a strike; no such notification had been given as of 30 March. Panic buying and long queues at garages were reported in Banbury, Christchurch and Crawley. The Unite trades union threatened a strike over health and safety standards earlier in March 2012. Unite represents around 2,000 tanker drivers, who deliver fuel to 90% of Britain's forecourts. ==The event== 25 March The Cabinet Office Minister, Francis Maude, called upon both the Unite union, who was balloting for a drivers' strike at seven fuel distribution firms, to seek an agreement with distribution companies via ACAS. The Unite Union's rep's argued that the outsourcing in the haulage industry has triggered relentless pressure on cutting costs, with firms likes of Asda, Shell and Esso all contracting out their deliveries to low quality rivals. The Government said preparations were underway, the army tanker fleet was put on standby as petrol tanker drivers at 5 of the 7 firms voted on strike action. The Petrol Retailers Association, whose membership represents more than 5,500 petrol stations, said that it knew nothing about any form of planned government contingency plans and was advising members to keep fuel levels high. The group's chairman, Brian Madderson told the BBC: \\"We have had no word from the Department of Energy and Climate Change whatsoever.\\" 26 March Talks continued at ACAS. 27 March Ministers consider plans to train up military personnel to ensure that fuel supplies are maintained at a cabinet meeting. Confused statements from UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Cabinet Minister Francis Maude, and later poor quality/alarmist media coverage lead to tens of thousands of motorists panic buying in Banbury, Christchurch and Crawley. By midday, Francis Maude had told drivers that they should make sure they have enough fuel in their vehicles and \\"maybe a little bit in their garage as well in a jerry can\\". However, both the AA and fire-fighters have now called on him to withdraw the advice, because of the risk of explosions in garages. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, warned of a danger of panic fuel buying, as did the AA after the government urged motorists to be ready for a strike-induced shortage. The AA also warned of the danger of panic-buying. Andrew Howard, its spokesman, said: \\"If people begin panic- buying we could well have shortages in fuel even before the strike.\\". As the day progressed there were scenes of long queues at petrol pumps in Liverpool, Preston and Kent, while pumps ran dry in Wilmslow in Cheshire and Llandudno Junction in North Wales. Some garages capped individual sales to stretch reserves, by using methods such as a 25-litre or ¬£20 maximum spend on any one purchase. Other forecourts had introduced 'minimum spend' rules of ¬£35, to try and prevent motorists who have a half-full tank from filling up again, as well as to turn an extra profit in a time of crisis. 28 March That morning David Cameron told a press conference that the fuel tanker drivers' strike has no justification and was part of a supposed Labour party plot to undermine his government. Later on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Maude denied that he had earlier told people to fill jerry cans. Petrol ran low in some Dorset, Hertfordshire and Herefordshire forecourts. 29 March Petrol Retailers Association said petrol sales increased by more than 170% and sales of diesel were up by almost 80%. Babu Jha, manager of MPK Filling Station in Leicester's Dysart Way, said on the 29th: \\"We have been really busy, probably three times as much as usual. People seem to be panicking.\\" as demand rose heavily in Leicester. The Aintree forecourt attendant Farhaan Mohammed, 21, said expected petrol to have run out by the end of trading and that there was no guarantee from Esso of more fuel. Worried motorists in Crawley and Horley queued for petrol. The Texaco garage in Telscombe Cliffs ran out of fuel and customers began rowing outside the petrol station at Asda in Hollingbury after accusations of queue jumping, as the stretched from the forecourt in to Carden Avenue. Taxi drivers reported long petrol queues in Clarence Place, Coroporation Road and parts of Maindee in Newport. ABC Taxis told drivers to top up amid fears stations would sell out. A van driver in Leeds said he had to wait for 30 minutes to get fuel, while a forecourt on the outskirts Harrogate had run out of fuel by 11.30am. Retail store Halfords reported \\"high\\" sales of fuel cans. Sales of all cans have soared by 225% compared with this time last year, with motorists buying in \\"the thousands\\", while sales of jerry cans are up by more than 500%. The Energy Secretary, Ed Davey urged motorists to \\"Keep tanks two-thirds full, but don't panic.\\". The London Fire Brigade urged businesses to place legal warnings on websites and petrol cans. Chief Inspector Nick Maton of Dorset Police warned motorists not to panic. The British army was put on standby to deliver petrol if a strike was called. 30 March That morning, Crawley's MP, Henry Smith said to the local newspaper's reporters that he supported the Government was right to warn people to prepare for a potential fuel strike, backed up France's Maude's advice (despite criticism that it caused panicked queues of spooked drivers and shortages at several petrol pumps). He also condemned the Labour Party's funding by the Trades Unions and accused the tanker drivers of being lazy fat cats. Later, the Government and national media went on to claim that the panic buying had led to an incident in which a woman from Moorgate, in Acomb, near York was badly burned at home, when petrol ignited as she transferred it between containers in her kitchen on 30 March. North Yorkshire Fier Brigade issue a warning on line and on Radio 5 over the storage of petrole. Diesel ran out in Banbury and Adderbury. Petrol and diesel both ran out in Hammersmith Bridge in South Shields and Newcastle upon Tyne. Long queues occurred in several places such as Banbury, Crawley and Gateshead in N.E. England. Police in southwest England asked many petrol stations to close temporarily amid violent and desperate panic buying by hysterical and fear-crazed motorists (A phenomenon called 'fuel rage' by police and forecourt staff). Later that evening the Tesco filling station at Inshes, Inverness, finally ran out of fuel. Motorists in Crawley and Horley queued for petrol. By mid-day the Unite's leadership ruled out Easter fuel strikes and negotiations were started at ACAS. and talks were planned for the next week. Morrisons in Freemen's Common, Leicester, and Asda at Fosse Park, used supermarket staff to act as marhals in an attempt manage motorists panicked motorists pumps. The Shell garage on the A6, near Leicester Racecourse, by midday and Tesco filling station in Hamilton, near Leicester, was out of both petrol and diesel by the evening, with later reports of several other stations exhausting their supplies. Queuing also occurred at the Shell Trocadero in Uppingham Road, Leicester. During the middle of the day London's Mayor, Boris Johnson called for the creation of a National Emergency Plan. Labour peer Lord Harris called for Francis Maude to resign in the wake of Diane Hill burning herself. The UK Petroleum Industry Association described fuel crisis as \\"self-inflicted insanity and condemned the Department of Energy's poor handling of the crisis. Several business leaders also said in a press release late that evening, warning that a strike would destroy the economy, cause a recession, and close small businesses. 31 March The government told people via the Department for Energy and Climate Change web page to stop panic buying after the Unite union ruled out a strike over Easter. There was still little sign of the situation easing as drivers formed queues of up to half a mile at those filling stations still holding supplies. Many forecourts were rationing drivers to as little as ¬£10 each, while others imposed a minimum spend of ¬£25. A Cornish garage even refused to serve anyone who was \\"not local\\" after the owner decided to turn away holidaymakers in favour of regular customers and account holders as supplies in Cornwall began to dry up. Trade at Banbury's Texaco and Adderbury's Esso had slackened, but were still out of diesel. Some afternoon queues and shortages at the petrol stations in Leeds, Tonbridge in Kent, Egham, Bromley in south-east London, Finchampstead in Berkshire and St Albans. PCSOs manned the pumps at Esso Tesco Express petrol station on Soundwell Road, Bristol. Evening demand for fuel appeared to be dropping, with unleaded petrol sales down from 172% above normal on Thursday to 57% above normal on 30th, according to independent retailers' group RMI Petrol. Diesel sales were down from 77% above normal on 29th to 29% above normal on the 30th. The AA estimated that one in five stations ran out of fuel that day. A BP spokesperson stated that there had been a reduction in demand on the forecourts but some were still low or had completely run out of stock and were awaiting deliveries. Motoring organisations also warned of a 2-3-day backlog as tanker crews attempt to refuel petrol stations. Several Labour MPs have also called for the resignation of the Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude over comments he made advising storing petrol in jerrycans. 1 April The planned strike was abandoned in the face of continuing talks at ACAS. The government introduces new taxes to make up for 'lost' tax revenue. 2 April Conciliation talks were planned between UNITE and Bosses at ACAS on 4 April according to an ACAS spokesperson. The RMI chairman, Brian Madderson, warning of a repeat of the previous week's fuel panic if talks failed. 4 April Talks continue at ACAS. 18 April Talks began to break down between the Unite Union and bosses at the Acas summit. A conference of 60 oil tanker drivers Unite's London headquarters rejected the proposals made by fuel distributors. The tanker drivers asked for the Health and Safety Executive and to create a tanker driver accreditation licence or \\"passport\\". 8 May A Unite spokesman said that 57.5% of members on a turnout of 79.5% voted for action short of strike in the union's re-ballot on the issue. 11 May Unite members voted by 51% in favour of the boss's proposals, which included the introduction of an industrywide accreditation covering health safety and training, a Unite said in a statement issued at its website. 12 May Unite chairwoman Diana Holland said the narrow vote would lead to no strike action taking place. ==Public Safety issues== An AA statement said: \\"A lady about 75 was seen filling up 20 empty one-gallon paint tins with plastic lids and also a tray of jam jars in her boot with petrol\\". The incident was in Macclesfield, Cheshire. One motorist tried to fill a pair of 1 gallon glass flagons with petrol in South Wales. The nozzle of the pump was, in fact, bigger than the neck of the flagon, and the fuel was spilt over the surrounding ground. A motorist in Ilkley, Yorkshire, was ejected from a garage forecourt after he had snatched the pump out of the hand of a female driver. Firefighters were called to deal with a fuel spillage after a car was overfilled with petrol in Deerswood Road, Crawley, West Sussex. Firefighters were called to deal with a fuel spillage after a motorist was ejected from a garage because he had snatched the pump out of the hand of an elderly driver.http://www.Leicestershiretraders.org.uk/blog.html (dead link 13 May) ==Aftermath== It was estimated that the panic buying would bring in ¬£32 million in fuel excise duty. The government announced new taxes on 1 April to compensate for 'lost' strike related tax revenue. The APD tax for short-haul flights went up from ¬£12 to ¬£13, while the tax on a long-haul rose to between ¬£62 (to the United States) to ¬£92 (to Australia). An increase in NHS prescription charges in England of 25p to ¬£7.65. A new Northern Irish Assembly business levy on large stores comes into force in Northern Ireland on 2 April. It revalued rates on commercial premises that have a rateable value of more than ¬£500,000. The proceeds will be used to reduce rates for smaller businesses, affecting 76 and is thought it will cost big shops an average of ¬£66,000 a year. Ikea claimed that Finance Minister Sammy Wilson could be putting jobs at risk. ==Responses== *The Petrol Retailers Association's chairman, Brian Madderson told the BBC: \\"We have had no word from the Department of Energy and Climate Change whatsoever.\\" on 25 March. *Unite's assistant general secretary, Diana Holland, said in a letter to Davey: \\"We have been tireless in seeking talks to avoid industrial action, but we have been frustrated at every turn.\\" on 28 March. *The AA also warned of the danger of panic-buying.

These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity. Another tradition is a vagina that acquires the power of speech to play the role of informant and reveal a history of previous lovers. Talking vaginas are an early theme in French literature, most notably in the 13th-century fabliau Le Chevalier qui faisoit parler les cons et les culs and in Les bijoux indiscrets, the first novel by Denis Diderot. Published anonymously in 1748, Les bijoux indiscrets (The Indiscreet Jewels) is an allegory that portrays Louis XV as the sultan Mangogul of the Congo who owns a magic ring that makes women's genitals (\\"jewels\\") talk. A comparable trope that Diderot must have known is found in the ribald fabliau. In American literature, a talking vagina is featured in the Ozark folktale The Magic Walking Stick, in which vaginas are made to act as informants. The talking vagina theme is the central trope of The Vagina Monologues. In modern art the talking vagina theme is featured prominently in the works of Stephanie Sarley in a subset of her \\"Crotch Monster\\" series. The talking vagina characters are depicted as anthropomorphized vulvae reacting emotionally and engaging in various activities. In film, the pornographic movies Le Sexe qui parle (1975) and its sequel (1978), and its non- pornographic remake, Chatterbox, feature talking vaginas. On television, Joan Rivers portrayed Princess Clara's talking vagina on Drawn Together. ==References== Category:Folklore Category:Pornography Category:Latin words and phrases Category:American literature Category:French literature Category:Vagina and vulva in art Category:Fictional body parts ","title":"Vagina loquens"},{"id":"35274568","text":"The river can be seen in the southwest, Click to view The Congue is a river of southwestern mainland Equatorial Guinea.

UPC may be performed at the input to a network \\"to protect network resources from malicious as well as unintentional misbehaviour\\". NPC is the same and done for the same reasons as UPC, but at the interface between two networks. UPC and NPC may involve traffic shaping, where traffic is delayed until it conforms to the expected levels and timing, or traffic policing, where non-conforming traffic is either discarded immediately, or reduced in priority so that it may be discarded downstream in the network if it would cause or add to congestion. ==Uses== In ATM The actions for UPC and NPC in the ATM protocol are defined in ITU-T Recommendation I.371 Traffic control and congestion control in B ISDN and the ATM Forum's User-Network Interface (UNI) Specification. These provide a conformance definition, using a form of the leaky bucket algorithm called the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA), which specifies how cells are checked for conformance with a cell rate, or its reciprocal emission interval, and jitter tolerance: either a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) for testing conformance to the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) or a Burst Tolerance or Maximum Burst Size (MBS) for testing conformance to the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR). UPC and NPC define a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) on the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) at which the bursts are transmitted. This MBS can be derived from or used to derive the maximum variation between the arrival time of traffic in the bursts from the time it would arrive at the SCR, i.e. a jitter about that SCR.ITU-T, Traffic control and congestion control in B ISDN, Recommendation I.371, International Telecommunication Union, 2004, page 17 UPC and NPC are normally performed on a per Virtual Channel (VC) or per Virtual Path (VP) basis, i.e. the intervals are measured between cells bearing the same Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI) and or Virtual Path Identifier (VPI). If the function is implemented at, e.g., a switch input, then because cells on the different VCs and VPs arrive sequentially, only a single implementation of the function is required. However, this single implementation must be able to access the parameters relating to a specific connection using the VCI and or VPI to address them. This is often done using Content-addressable memory (CAM), where the VCI and or VPI form the addressable content. Cells that fail to conform, i.e. because they come too soon after the preceding cell on the channel or path because the average rate is too high or because the jitter exceeds the tolerance, may be dropped, i.e. discarded, or reduced in priority so that they may be discarded downstream if there is congestion. The GCRA, while, possibly, complicated to describe and understand, can be implemented very simply. While it is more likely to be implemented in hardware, as an example, an assembly language implementation can be written in as few as 15 to 20 instructions with a longest execution path of as few as 8 to 12 instructions, depending on the language (availability of indirection and the orthogonality of the instruction set). In AFDX Transmissions onto an AFDX network are required to be limited to a Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG). Conformance to this BAG (and maximum transmission jitter) is then checked in the network switches in a similar way to UPC in ATM networks. However, the token bucket algorithm is recommended for AFDX, and a version that allows for variable length frames (one that counts bytes) is preferred over one that only counts frames and assumes that all frames are of the maximum permitted length. ==See also== *Traffic contract *Connection admission control *Traffic shaping *Traffic policing (communications) *Leaky Bucket *Token bucket *Generic Cell Rate Algorithm *Audio Video Bridging ==References == Category:Computer networking ","title":"UPC and NPC"},{"id":"35274599","text":"The Mven is a river of southwestern mainland Equatorial Guinea.

The great number of clubs that were founded during the beginning of the 20th century in Argentina resulted in the creation of many leagues and associations, which run in line with Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Football. One of those leagues was the \\"Federaci√≥n Argentina de Football\\", which run until 1914 when it merged with AFA. Sportivo Palermo squad in 1927. Sportivo Palermo wanted to affiliate to the new association, so the team merged with Club Atlas, an institution from La Paternal, Buenos Aires, in 1915. The name \\"Sportivo Palermo\\" prevailed over Atlas for the new club. Its home field was placed in Caseros, Buenos Aires, moving to Palermo neighborhood in 1922.\\"Atlas no hubiera sido Atlas\\" by Miguel Angel Giordano on Atlas Marron website (Archive, 4 Mar 2016) In 1917 the club won the Segunda Divisi√≥n championship, and three years later Sportivo Palermo took over Asociaci√≥n Atl√©tica Eureka, another football club which had been promoted to Categor√≠a de Honor division. Palermo's first participation in Primera Divisi√≥n was in 1920, playing consecutively in the top division of Argentine football until 1932, when the club was relegated to second division. At the beginning of 1922 the club managers got a field that was property of then British-owned company Ferrocarril Central Argentino. That land was located in the crossing of Canning Avenue and the railway tracks, near the Rio de la Plata. Sportivo Palermo started to build a stadium there, finishing the works in 1924.\\"Una cancha junto al r√≠o\\", by Carlos Aira, 2012-01-30 Sportivo's best campaign in Primera was in 1922 when finishing in second place after champion Hurac√°n.

That squad had six players of Sportivo Palermo in its roster: Patern√≥ster, Weismuller, Zumelz√∫, Bidoglio, Herman, and Juan Evaristo.

After the 1934 season the AAF and the Liga Argentina de Football (the professional league) merged to form the \\"Asociaci√≥n del Football Argentino\\" which has remained professional to date.

It is a free service that investigates complaints about lawyers in England and Wales. The Legal Ombudsman was set up as a result of the Legal Services Act 2007 and took over from the Legal Complaints Service and other legal complaint-handling bodies. The current Chief Executive is Rebecca Marsh, who replaced Rob Powell in April 2019. She also holds the position of current Chief Ombudsman. The Legal Ombudsman is a member of the Ombudsman Association.http://www.ombudsmanassociation.org ==Governance and jurisdiction== Sections 114 and 115 of the Legal Services Act 2007 established the Office for Legal Complaints and stipulated that it must operate an ombudsman scheme. The OLC appointed the first chief ombudsman and acts as the Legal Ombudsman‚Äôs board. The OLC is responsible to both the Legal Services Board and the Ministry of Justice. The current chair of the OLC is Elisabeth Davies.http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/about-us/#our-board The Legal Ombudsman can investigate complaints made by members of the public (and small businesses, clubs and charities) about the service they receive from lawyers working in England and Wales. The following types of lawyers fall within the Legal Ombudsman's jurisdiction: * costs lawyers * legal executives * licensed conveyancers * notaries * patent attorneys * probate practitioners * registered European lawyers * solicitors * trademark attorneys From the 28 January 2015 the Legal Ombudsman began to take complaints about authorised claims management companies. The Legal Ombudsman‚Äôs role is restricted to investigating issues around quality of service. Because the Legal Ombudsman is a lay organisation (section 122 (2) of the Legal Services Act does not allow a lawyer to be the Chief Ombudsman), generally, it cannot say whether legal advice is correct or not. The exception is if it appears that the advice is so unreasonable that no other lawyer in the same circumstances would have given it: this is the reasonable or common sense approach. Similarly, the Legal Ombudsman cannot make decisions on matters of negligence because negligence is a legal concept that must be proved in a court of law. However, it is possible that poor service, which the Legal Ombudsman can investigate, might overlap with evidence that a complainant might wish to use to argue that their lawyer has been negligent. Where there is an overlap, only the courts have the authority to decide what amounts to negligence. The Legal Ombudsman‚Äôs rules allow it to decline to investigate cases that relate to legal advice or negligence if it thinks that they would be better dealt with by the courts or some other scheme. Any issues relating to the general conduct of a lawyer will be referred to the appropriate regulating body. For instance, where there is evidence to suggest a solicitor may have been guilty of misconduct, the Legal Ombudsman will refer the matter to the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Complainants normally have to complain to the lawyer first. Failing this there are two relevant time limits regarding taking a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman: It will accept complaints up to six years from the date of act/omission, or three years from when the complainant should have known about the complaint if later. However, this new limit will be introduced gradually so at the moment the problem must have happened on or after 6 October 2010. ==Impartiality== Sections 122 (3) and (8) of the Legal Services Act 2007 provide that the Chief Ombudsman must not be a lawyer. In addition, as an arms-length body the Legal Ombudsman is not affiliated to lawyers‚Äô representative bodies or their regulators. In this respect it differs from the Legal Complaints Service, one of its predecessors. ==References * Official website Category:Legal organisations based in England and Wales Category:Consumer protection in the United Kingdom Category:Solicitors Category:Organizations established in 2010 Category:2010 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Legal regulators of the United Kingdom ","title":"Legal Ombudsman"},{"id":"35274765","text":"Jinx, stylized as J!NX, is a San Diego, California-based clothing line started by Sean Gailey and Tim Norris in 1999 that creates video game -themed apparel. ==Early history== Jinx was started as a home business in 1999 by two web developers: Sean Gailey and Tim Norris.

The company was started by Jim Rossignol in 2010. AVSEQ was released in 2011, Fallen City is in the final bug-testing phase prior to release, while the two currently under development are Lodestone (currently on hold) and Sir, You Are Being Hunted. ==Games== AVSEQ The name comes from combining audio and visual (audio-visual) with \\"sequencer\\". Game play is abstract in nature, and revolves around linking \\"atom\\" structures together to gain points. This also unlocks musical notes and activates that level's audio sequencer. The developers claim that \\"Each AVSEQ level has 2.2300745198530623√ó10^43 possible audio permutations\\". Fallen City This game is about rebuilding a city which has fallen into decay, which came from an idea by Rossignol that was put to Channel 4 in 2010, and was commissioned by Channel 4 Education. The game aims to educate children, by showing them how persuading people to clean up and repair can raise morale and improve the behaviour of citizens. The game is played in the first person, the player being able to walk through the city and persuade the citizens, who are known as \\"Angries\\", to repair it, clean it up, and rebuild. The Angries change colour according to their mood, purple being the ultimate state of anger and despair. Completing certain tasks gives the Angries extra powers, such as the ability to create street art, and certain infrastructure repairs improve the areas communications and give the community new systems for their benefit. Keith Stuart of The Guardian described some of these‚Äî\\"Reactivating a communications tower will get the word out about clean-up efforts, [...] the trade plaza represents commerce and a system that pumps curry into every home is a great allegory for everyday utilities.\\" Rossignol says that Fallen City is based around the \\"broken windows theory\\" of James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, which says that keeping an area in good-repair changes a populations outlook and so prevents further vandalism and prevents a descent into more serious crimes. In an interview in The Guardian, Rossignol states that \\"The reason the Angries have trashed their city is because they have been promised too much by the people in charge; the promises haven't been fulfilled and they've ended up feeling frustrated and alienated. So they've deliberately trashed the city ‚Äì to get what they were promised.\\" Lodestone Lodestone is an exploration game, the purpose of which is to survive a journey through magnetic islands and the game environment, populated with artificial lifeforms. The game has been put on hold while the company develops its fourth game ‚Äì Sir, You Are Being Hunted. Sir, You Are Being Hunted Created using the Unity game engine. A Kickstarter pledge drive to fund completion of the game was launched on 2 November 2012. The Signal From T√∂lva A science fiction first-person shooter made with the Unity game engine released in 2017. ==References * Big Robot website Category:Video game companies established in 2010 Category:Video game companies of the United Kingdom Category:Video game development companies ","title":"Big Robot"},{"id":"35274968","text":"Lisa Rogak is an American author, primarily of biographies and other nonfiction books.

The issue became a political controversy, described by at least one newspaper as a political scandal, dubbed Pastygate in March 2012. ==Background== Under long-standing VAT legislation, sale of most foods bought to eat or cook at home is zero-rated for VAT, meaning that no tax is charged. By contrast, meals bought and consumed in a restaurant, and hot take-away food or drink, are charged at a standard 20% tax rate. At the boundary between these two classes, there has been a history of legal challenges around food which is baked for sale, and is sold while still hot. If food could be claimed to be hot only incidentally, it could be zero-rated - this would apply to freshly baked bread, but also pies, pasties and similar items. This legislation stated: > 4.4 What about freshly cooked products? If you sell freshly cooked products > for consumption while they are still hot they are standard-rated, see > paragraph 4.5. Some of these products are, however, not sold with such an > intention. They may only be hot/warm as they are in the process of cooling > down. Examples include pies, pasties, sausage rolls and similar savoury > products, cooked chickens or joints of meat, bread products and croissants. > The liability will depend, therefore, on how you prepare and sell them. If > they are sold specifically for consumption whilst still hot (as a result of > being freshly prepared, baked, cooked, reheated or kept warm), they will be > standard-rated. See also paragraph 4.5 If they are sold warm simply because > they happen to be freshly baked, are in the process of cooling down and are > not intended to be eaten while hot; or cold or chilled at the time of > purchase, they can be zero-rated. > 4.5 What do we mean by ‚Äòspecifically sold for consumption whilst still hot‚Äô? > You sell food specifically for consumption whilst still hot if you either: > *have an established hot take-away trade and are selling the food as a part > of that trade *advertise it as either hot take-away food or in any other way > which indicates that it is meant to be eaten while still hot *sell it > accompanied by napkins, forks, etc to enable it to be eaten before it cools In the March budget papers, the Government published a paper which claimed: > The borderline between hot takeaway food (standard-rated) and cold takeaway > food (zero-rated) has for a number of years been the subject of litigation > with some retailers arguing that the purpose of heating their food products > is to improve their appearance or to comply with health and safety > regulations, rather than to enable them to be consumed hot. This litigation > has been decided on the facts of each individual case. The document proposed to > apply VAT at the standard rate to all food which is at a temperature above > the ambient air temperature at the time that it is provided to the customer, > with the exception of freshly baked bread. This will clarify the rules in > this area and ensure that all hot takeaway food is taxed consistently. ==Opposition== In response to the ensuing row, a number of campaigns were launched in order to try to prevent the tax rise on the Cornish pasty. These ranged from The Suns \\"Who VAT all the pies\\" campaign to an online petition set up by the Cornish Pasty Association entitled \\"Don't Tax My Pasty\\". A Labour Member of Parliament (John Mann MP) asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Conservative MP George Osborne, about when he had last eaten a Cornish pasty. Osborne answered that he had no idea, and this answer was used to allege that the Conservatives had become \\"out of touch\\" with ordinary people. The Prime Minister David Cameron later said that he had recently eaten a Cornish pasty at Leeds railway station and enjoyed it. However, the pasty outlet at that railway station had closed two years previously.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/29/pasty-row-david- cameron The issue, which at first appeared to be unimportant, was then taken up by several other newspapers and political commentators. The VAT rise on the pasty would affect both these customers and the pasty industry itself: Greggs, the largest British bakery chain, warned that the tax would harm its business and lead to store closures, and petitions to oppose the tax were signed by over half a million people. These newspapers and commentators made fun of David Cameron's attempt to show himself as a regular pasty eater (i.e. as one of the people) and George Osborne's inability to remember when he had last eaten one. Cameron defended the proposition and said that the move would defend takeaway restaurants against competition from major chains. The \\"pasty tax\\" was one of the issues cited by Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband when he labelled the 2012 budget an \\"omnishambles\\", a word coined by political comedy series The Thick of It. The word saw continued usage in the media, and was included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013. ==Outcome== After the public opposition, Osborne significantly altered the plans in late May, which was characterised as a \\"U-turn\\". A 2014 study observed that the \\"pasty tax\\" affair, although only a small change to the VAT rules, demonstrates that making changes to the VAT system is very difficult, and may itself have caused damage to VAT reform efforts. A separate 2014 editorial argued that the backlash to the \\"pasty tax\\" and the Danish \\"fat tax\\" have made it unlikely for politicians to attempt to impose further sumptuary taxes on food, which would otherwise be potential anti-obesity policies. ==References== Category:Political scandals in the United Kingdom Category:2012 in the United Kingdom ","title":"Pasty tax"},{"id":"35275015","text":"High Pasture Cave (Gaelic: Uamh An Ard-Achaidh) is an archaeological site on the island of Skye, Scotland. Human presence is documented since the Mesolithic, and remains, including Iron Age structures, point to ritual veneration of either the landscape or deities associated with the place. The cave system extends to about of accessible passages ==Site== The cave is about southeast of the village of Torrin, near Kilbride. The entrance of the cave lies in a narrow valley on the northern slopes of the mountain of Beinn D√πbhaich, east of the Red Cuillin hills, and is formed by erosion of Durness limestone. The interior is accessed via a natural shaft about deep that leads into the main cave, which appears to have been in use between 1,200 BC and 200 BC (mid-Bronze Age to late Iron Age). After about there is a fork, with a rocky, dry passage on the right. In 2002 the cave explorer Steven Birch discovered broken crockery and bones. Previous visitors to the cave had thrown this material aside in the attempts to find new ways. Birch recognized the value of the find as well as the importance of the cave. ==Excavations== The cave system was originally excavated in 1972 by students of the University of London Speleological Society. A full year of excavation then took place in 2003, mainly supported by Historic Scotland, and continuing project work was under the supervision of Steven Birch and Martin Wildgoose.\\"Uamh An Ard Achadh\\". High Pasture Cave Project. Retrieved 30 April 2012. ==Finds== Arrowheads left behind by nomadic hunters suggest occupation during the Mesolithic period (about 6,000 to 7,000 years ago). It was only occasionally occupied during the Neolithic and the Bronze Age until about 800 BC, when the site became more frequented and a large fire place was set up in front of its entrance. The entrance area also seems to have been used for ceremonies or storage of personal items. A wide variety of artifacts has been recovered from the cave and its surroundings, including stone items, bone, antler and residue of metalworkings along with well-preserved faunal remains.\\"High Pasture Cave\\" Highland Council. Retrieved 30 April 2012. During the following 1000 years, activities and ash deposits of the fire site threatened to block the entrance of the cave. A staircase about in length was built to permit entry to the cave. Hundreds of finds (bronze, bone and antler needles, glass and ivory beads) around the fire pit and the cave floor point to a place of intense activity. This lasted until about 40 BC, when the stairs were completely filled with boulders and earth. The skeleton of a woman along with a four to five month-old fetus and a nine to ten month-old child were placed on top of the filling. In 2012 a piece of carved wood thought to be the bridge of a lyre was discovered. The small burnt and broken piece has been dated to approximately 300 BC and is the earliest find of a stringed instrument in western Europe. The notches where the strings would have been placed can be easily distinguished and according to Graeme Lawson of Cambridge Music Archaeological Research the find \\"pushes the history of complex music [in Britain] back more than a thousand years\\".\\"Delight at find of ancient lyre\\".

T. McLaughlin. Flirt sailed from Baltimore on 15 December 1839 as the flagship of a small squadron of schooners. Based at Key West they operated along the coast of Florida during the suppression of Indian uprisings. The force prevented the Indians from receiving ammunition and supplies from Cuba and Bermuda, and organized expeditions into the Everglades to protect settlers' lives and property. When the squadron was dissolved in 1842, Flirt was ordered north, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 July. From August to November 1842, Flirt lay \\"in ordinary\\" at Norfolk, Virginia, then served as receiving ship at Charleston, South Carolina, until April 1843, when she was fitted out for service as a dispatch ship. Based at Norfolk, Flirt carried passengers and mail destined for the Pacific Squadron to Panama, and touched at many ports in the Gulf of Mexico to transfer men and supplies. Under the command of Lieutenant James Shedden Palmer, during the Mexican War of 1846-47, she continued carrying despatches for the Pacific Squadron to Panama, as well as transporting mail and supplies between New Orleans and Galveston for the forces in Texas, and occasionally blockading Mexican ports.

Personnel were formally called Railway Investigation Officers but their title changed in 1987 when the role of patrolling Government Trams and Buses came within their responsibility, renaming the division to Victoria Transit Patrol. The Victoria Transit Patrol Department was officially disbanded in 1992 giving total Transit Law Enforcement responsibilities to the Victoria Police. ==History== The Victoria Transit Patrol was formed in 1878 after the Victoria Railway Commissioner determined that there was a need for a detective to investigate crimes, missing luggage and freight, and accidents that took place on the railway system. They were expanded in 1890 with the introduction of officers who made random checks at railway stations to arrest those who evaded fares. These officers were initially referred to as ‚ÄúFlying Gangs‚Äù but were later called Ticket Examiners. In 1899, the name used for detectives of the organization changed to Special Inquiry Officers and they became their own branch within what was then, the Victorian Railways. Another name change came in 1947 when the Special Inquiry Branch was renamed the Railway Investigation Division and the officers were referred to as Railway Investigation Officers. The Transit Patrol has had numerous other divisions including the Armored Vehicle Division that was used to transport payrolls and station revenue. In 1986, Transit Patrol took over the policing of trams and buses in addition to their railway duties. It was approximately one year later when the department became managed by the Victoria Police while still coming under the Metropolitan / State Transport Authority's umbrella at which time it was renamed the Transit Patrol. In 1992, the Transit Patrol became defunct and ceased to exist. ==Sidearms and Equipment== Standard firearm issue was the Ruger Police Service-Six stainless steel, 6 shot .357 magnum with standard issue ammunition being 125 grain JHP 38+P. When working undercover, officers had the choice of the Ruger Police Service-Six or the Smith & Wesson \\"Chief's Special\\" stainless steel 5 shot in .38 calibre. Officers were free to use their own equipment belt and accessories or the departmental equipment belts with gun holster manufactured by \\"Helweg\\" of Melbourne. Officers were issued a 26 Inch polycarbonate nightstick with belt ring, standard issue departmental handcuffs were the \\"Saf Lok\\" mark 4 issue with double cylinder lock making them virtually pick proof along with Motorola 2 way portable radio with or without extension mouthpiece . Other departmental issue equipment was a 1P key to enable officers to raise and lock boom gates at faulty level crossings to enable traffic to pass but only at the direction of the officer.

South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic, which is among the most severe in the world, is concentrated in its townships, where many black South Africans live due to the lingering effects of the Group Areas Act. False traditional beliefs about HIV/AIDS, which contribute to the spread of the disease, persist in townships due to the lack of education and awareness programmes in these regions. Sexual violence and local attitudes toward HIV/AIDS have also amplified the epidemic. Although some education efforts and treatment and prevention programmes have succeeded in spreading awareness about HIV/AIDS in townships, the impact of the disease remains severe. ==Prevalence== Provinces of South Africa. In 2008, HIV/AIDS was most prevalent in the South African provinces of KwaZulu-Natal (15.8% HIV-positive), Mpumalanga (15.4% HIV-positive), Free State (12.6% HIV- positive), and North West (11.3% HIV-positive), while only 3.8% of the population was HIV-positive in Western Cape. A survey conducted in 2010 indicated that HIV/AIDS infection among pregnant women is highest in KwaZulu- Natal (39.5%), Mpumalanga (35.1%), Free State (30.6%), and Gauteng (30.4%). ==Traditional beliefs about HIV/AIDS== South Africans in townships are more likely to hold false beliefs about HIV transmission and prevention because they are less likely to have received a formal education or be employed. Many South Africans in townships are unaware of the primary modes of HIV/AIDS transmission: through unprotected sex with an HIV-positive individual, through contact with the blood of an HIV-positive individual, and through mother-to- child transmission from an HIV-positive mother to her baby during pregnancy.\\"HIV/AIDS Information.\\" Modes of HIV Transmission. Web. 8 Apr. 2012. . Instead, the traditional beliefs of South Africans in townships have contributed to sexual violence in South Africa and stigmatized HIV-positive individuals, particularly women, thereby increasing the severity of the disease in the region. Stigma HIV/AIDS stigma is widespread in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents were unwilling to share a meal with a person living with AIDS, 18% were unwilling to sleep in the same room as with someone with AIDS, and 6% were unwilling to talk to a person with AIDS.S.C., Kalichman, and Simbayi L. \\"Traditional Beliefs about the Cause of AIDS and AIDS-related Stigma in South Africa.\\" AIDS Care 16.5 (2004): 572-80. Print. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized. In addition, many traditional groups believe that ancestral spirits and supernatural forces punish those who have failed to lead moral lives by infecting them with HIV. According to a study published in 2004, South Africans who attributed HIV/AIDS to spirits and the supernatural were more likely to claim that people with HIV/AIDS were \\"dirty,\\" \\"repulsive,\\" \\"cursed,\\" and \\"foolish\\" and should \\"have restrictions on their freedom,\\" \\"be isolated,\\" and \\"feel guilty and ashamed.\\" Women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection and stigma because they are often economically dependent on men and frequently lack access to education. Men who have the disease may avoid testing and remain anonymous, but women who undergo pre-natal testing are less likely to escape a diagnosis. Because women are often identified as HIV-positive before men, they are branded as the spreaders of the disease and may subsequently face physical abuse and abandonment. A study conducted in 2010 indicated that the majority of girls in a Cape Town township correlated thinness with disease ‚Äì in particular, HIV/AIDS. Because of this, women who are slender or experience weight loss also face discrimination. This form of stigma affects women living in townships most severely because rates of malnourishment are higher in townships than in other parts of South Africa.Puoane, Thandi, Lungiswa Tsolekile, and Nelia Steyn. \\"Perceptions about Body Image and Sizes among Black African Girls Living in Cape Town.\\" Ethnicity & Disease 20 (2010): 29-34. Print. ==Spread of the disease== Multiple factors have contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS in South African townships. Sexual violence in townships, which results partially from cultural norms regarding gender-based power dynamics and partially from psychological desperation, makes women particularly susceptible to HIV/AIDS. Female rates of HIV infection in South Africa are on average five times higher than male infection rates due to biological and social vulnerability.\\"HIV and AIDS.\\" UNICEF South Africa. UNICEF. Web. 30 Mar. 2012. . Sexual violence Although many township inhabitants are knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS prevention methods, rates of condom use are still strikingly low. Studies suggest that fear of sexual abuse, which results from unequal power dynamics between men and women in South African townships, is the primary explanation for low condom use rates. Women in Khutsong reported that their relationship would deteriorate if they insisted that their partner use a condom because such a request demonstrates a lack of trust and respect.MacPhail, Catherine, and Catherine Campbell. \\"‚ÄòI Think Condoms Are Good But, Aai, I Hate Those Things‚Äô: Condom Use among Adolescents and Young People in a Southern African Township.\\" Social Science & Medicine 52.11 (2001): 1613-627. Print. Ubuntu, an African philosophy that promotes a spirit of brotherhood between and among community members, explains why township adolescents knowingly spread the disease ‚Äì they believe that the entire community should share their burden. As a result of this philosophy, HIV-positive fathers will sometimes rape their daughters to guarantee their loyalty and care when their parent's health begins to deteriorate. It is likely that the sense of peer group affiliation that developed among township adolescents during apartheid has contributed to the desire to share the frustration and hopelessness that accompany the disease.Leclerc‚ÄêMadlala, Suzanne. \\"Infect One, Infect All: Zulu Youth Response to the Aids Epidemic in South Africa.\\" Medical Anthropology 17.4 (1997): 363-80.

Print. Orphanhood is a severe consequence of the AIDS epidemic in South African townships: a 2006 study stated that there were 2.2 million AIDS-orphaned children in South Africa alone. AIDS orphans in an urban Cape Town township have been shown to have significant rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, peer relationship difficulties, suicidal urges, delinquency, and homelessness. These rates are higher than those of both non-AIDS orphans and non-orphans in South African townships.Cluver, Lucie, Frances Gardner, and Don Operario. \\"Psychological Distress amongst AIDS-orphaned Children in Urban South Africa.\\" Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 48.8 (2007): 755-63. Print. AIDS orphans are particularly vulnerable to poverty, malnutrition, stigma, exploitation, sickness, and sexual abuse, which lead to intense psychological trauma. AIDS orphans are also less likely than non-AIDS orphans and non- orphans to attend and remain enrolled in school due to stigma and an increase in adult responsibilities such as care work and formal or informal employment.Cluver, Lucie, Frances Gardner, and Don Operario. \\"Poverty and Psychological Health among AIDS-orphaned Children in Cape Town, South Africa.\\" AIDS Care 21.6 (2009): 732-41. Print. ==Education== There is currently no law requiring AIDS education in South African schools and government attempts to raise AIDS awareness have largely failed to reach South Africa's underserved townships, where the quality of education is poor.Kuhn, L., M. Steinberg, and C. Mathews. \\"Participation of the School Community in AIDS Education: An Evaluation of a High School Programme in South Africa.\\" AIDS Care 6.2 (1994): 161-71. Print. However, there is a clear need for education programmes in South African townships ‚Äì a survey in Khutsong demonstrated that 70% of the community's young men believed they were not vulnerable to infection. A 1994 pilot study in an urban Cape Town township demonstrated the potential, but also the limitations, of AIDS education. The study compared AIDS knowledge in two schools, one of which underwent an intensive AIDS awareness programme and one of which did not. Before the programme, students in both schools were misinformed about HIV transmission ‚Äì many wrongly believed that drinking from an unwashed cup and touching somebody with the disease could transmit the virus. Few students knew that using condoms, having only one sexual partner, and attending clinics for information and tests can all help prevent HIV/AIDS. Before the implementation of the educational programme, students in both schools also expressed hostility toward HIV-positive individuals ‚Äì very few indicated that they would welcome an HIV-positive student into their class. They were also likely to underestimate the prevalence and severity of the disease. Following the completion of the AIDS awareness programme, the students who had participated were more knowledgeable about HIV transmission, prevention, and the course of the disease. However, hostility toward HIV- positive individuals decreased only slightly among the students after the programme and the students did not demonstrate any intention to increase their use of condoms. ==Treatment and prevention== Most of South Africa's current anti-HIV/AIDS efforts involve treatment rather than prevention. Although prevention programmes are considered more cost effective, the pervasiveness of the disease has made treatment facilities increasingly important. A 2005 study determined that the introduction of antiretroviral medication, mother-to-child transmission prevention programmes, and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, or Doctors Without Borders, clinics to Khayelitsha played a role in reducing the impact of the disease.Levy, N. C. \\"From Treatment to Prevention: The Interplay Between HIV/AIDS Treatment Availability and HIV/AIDS Prevention Programming in Khayelitsha, South Africa.\\" Journal of Urban Health 82.3 (2005): 498-509. Print. These programmes have started to confront the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Khayelitsha by making treatment more widely available and providing incentives for HIV testing. Despite these specific successes, treatment has played a limited role in South African townships due to their lack of infrastructure and trained professionals and the high cost of antiretroviral drugs. HIV/AIDS prevention efforts such as school education, education in the workplace, and mass media campaigns have largely failed to significantly impact South African townships. For example, HIV voluntary counseling and testing programmes have improved HIV/AIDS awareness in Khayelitsha, but have for the most part failed to influence behavior.Venkatesh, Kartik K., Precious Madiba, Guy De Bruyn, Mark N. Lurie, Thomas J. Coates, and Glenda E. Gray. \\"Who Gets Tested for HIV in a South African Urban Township? Implications for Test and Treat and Gender- based Prevention Interventions.\\" JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 56.2 (2011): 151-65. Print. On the other hand, specific HIV/AIDS prevention methods such as the Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method have demonstrated a potential for success.Weir, Sharon, Charmaine Pailman, Xoli Mahlalela, Nicol Coetzee, Farshid Meidany, and Ties Boerma. \\"From People to Places: Focusing AIDS Prevention Efforts Where It Matters Most.\\" Epidemiology & Social 17.6 (2003): 895-903. Print. A 2003 study used the PLACE method to determine where in townships people meet new sexual partners in order to strategically focus prevention efforts in these locations. These locations included bars, taverns, bottle stores, nightclubs, streets, hotels, and local shebeens. The vast majority of these locations did not provide condoms or information about the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Most patrons visit these sites daily or weekly; therefore, the PLACE method suggests that prevention efforts such as education and social support could be successfully focused on these popular venues. Churches in South African townships have largely failed to use their social and cultural influence to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Many churches reject HIV-positive members because they are ignorant about the causes of AIDS, have traditional views on sexual morality, or believe that HIV/AIDS is well-deserved punishment for immoral behavior. In addition, many organizations such as the South African Church Leaders Association have only formally acknowledged the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the last decade. Despite these large-scale failures, some township churches have become actively engaged in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS in their communities. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of the Anglican Church in the Western Cape founded the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation and speaks openly and progressively about the role of education in battling HIV/AIDS. St. Michael's Church in Khayelitsha has supported the efforts of the Millennium Development Goals by founding an HIV/AIDS clinic and orphanage known as Fikelela; this movement has spread to dozens of other Anglican churches in the region. ==Attempts to address the epidemic== HIV/AIDS was largely considered a peripheral problem by the South African government and NGOs before the disintegration of apartheid in 1994. However, since then, efforts have been made to address the epidemic with varying levels of success. South Africa's government leaders largely failed to acknowledge the severity of the AIDS epidemic until 2009, which prevented the implementation of successful policy. However, many NGOs have succeeded in targeting South Africa's vulnerable township populations. National government The effectiveness of government-based anti-HIV/AIDS programmes in South African townships was severely reduced by the AIDS denialism of President Thabo Mbeki, who was in office from 14 June 1999 until 24 September 2008, and Manto Tshabalala- Msimang, who served as Health Minister from 25 September 2008 through 10 May 2009. These South African leaders brought the issue of AIDS denialism to the forefront of South African politics by rejecting scientific evidence demonstrating the connection between HIV and AIDS and declaring antiretroviral therapy ineffective.Daniel, John, Adam Habib, and Roger Southall. State of the Nation: South Africa, 2003-2004. Cape Town, South Africa: HSRC, 2003. Print. In 2000, President Mbeki invited nonconformist scientists such as Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick to a Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS while excluding leading researchers from the convention. President Mbeki's denialism hindered progress in government HIV/AIDS policy by generating skepticism about HIV/AIDS among members of South Africa's Department of Health. This skepticism slowed the implementation of antiretroviral therapy programmes in many of South Africa's townships, particularly in Mpumalanga. Despite President Mbeki's denialism, the South African government did make efforts to combat the nation's HIV/AIDS crisis while Mbeki was in office. The National AIDS Convention of South Africa (NACOSA) first met in 1992 to design a national AIDS plan to fight the emerging epidemic, which was endorsed by Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, South Africa's incoming Minister of Health. However, the plan was largely ineffective because it failed to acknowledge the government's lack of economic resources. The development of the controversial AIDS drug Virodene in South Africa in 1996 reintroduced enthusiasm about HIV/AIDS into the political sphere and led to the successful implementation of several small- scale projects by the national government.Butler, A. \\"South Africa's HIV/AIDS Policy, 1994-2004: How Can It Be Explained?\\" African Affairs 104.417 (2005): 591-614. Print. The Khayelitsha District Management Team was established to focus on AIDS from an epidemiological angle and an AIDS programme coordinator was appointed to Khayelitsha to monitor the disease in the township. The government also financed a mother-to-child-transmission programme in Khayelitsha in 1999. However, stigmatization and the government's dismissal of new treatment options continued as Mbeki's denialism campaign intensified in the early 2000s. The government issued the HIV/AIDS/STD Strategic Plan for South Africa 2000-2005 at the urging of the United Nations, but the plan lacked concrete proposals and a timeline and largely neglected the potential of antiretroviral therapy. Jacob Zuma, South Africa's president as of 9 May 2009, has expanded the national government's HIV/AIDS outreach programmes in an attempt to serve marginalized township populations and the country as a whole. On World AIDS Day on 1 December 2009, President Zuma announced his intention to reverse South Africa's health trends by increasing HIV treatment nationwide. He insisted that HIV-positive children under age one and pregnant women would receive increased attention and treatment in accordance with World Health Organization treatment guidelines.Dugger, Celia. \\"Breaking With Past, South Africa Issues Broad AIDS Policy.\\" New York Times. 1 Dec. 2009.

The lake has several land patches away from the coastline, which are used as holidays resorts or for clubbing.Ghioroc Town Hall: Tourism section The lake is divided into two sides, \\"Ghioroc 1\\" and \\"Ghioroc 2\\". The second side, Ghioroc 2, is the only side opened for tourists. The first side is still being preserved as a mining point. The lake is from Arad, Romania, and from Timi»ôoara, Romania. ==History== The lake has been created as a result of mining. In the 1960s in the Socialist Romania, Ghioroc Lake used to be a point of extraction for gravel and other aggregates. The lake has been extensively used for this purpose up until the '80s, when such materials were no longer needed. Large amounts of sand and gravel are still extracted from the adjacent Ghioroc 2 gravelpit, and from a new pit currently being exploited nearby. In the early 1990s, the lake has been opened for tourists, although it has not been officially recognized as a touristic destination. Due to the high level of pollution and remaining of the exploitation, the lake was temporarily shut down and all the remaining waste has been cleared out. In the 2000s, the lake has been officially added as a touristic attraction in the Arad County. The lake has been completely cleaned up and an artificial beach has been created. Fish have also been added for the purpose of reproduction, but also to populate the lake. ==Tourism== Lake Ghioroc is essential for the economy of Ghioroc. It brings a considerable amount of income to the town. It is mostly popular for tourists, as plenty come during the summer. It is estimated that hundreds of tourists visit it, on an average summer day.Ghioroc Lake, home seaboard of Arad's inhabitants There are a few shops and restaurants on its southern shore. There is also a parking facility. Although the beach is artificial, the sand comes from the lake itself. Unfortunately, access to the lake is gradually being reduced by sale of large portions of the shoreline, and erecting fences to prevent access. At the same time, easy access to the beaches is reduced by digging them up, or covering the sand with soil. Access to the North side of the lake has been seriously impeded by ploughing the adjoining land right up to the edge of the lake. ==Fishing== Lake Ghioroc has two main species of fish: crappies and roach. Fishing is allowed, under the laws of Romania. The lake is a popular destination among fishermen, because of the accessible location of the lake. There have been several fishing contests being held at this lake. ==Nautical sports== Lake Ghioroc can also be used for practicing nautical sports. Windsurfing and diving are performed there, due to the high winds and size/depth of the lake. ==Depth controversy== The maximum depth of Lake Ghioroc is controversial. It is a local legend that says that no one has ever reached the bottom of the lake.Ghioroc gathers, day and night, thousands of people willing to have fun ==References== Category:Lakes of Romania Category:Artificial lakes Category:Geography of Arad County Category:Tourist attractions in Arad County ","title":"Lake Ghioroc"},{"id":"35275653","text":"Emamzadeh Mohammad () may refer to: *Emamzadeh Seyyed Mohammad, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari *Emamzadeh Seyyed Mohammad, Eqlid, Fars Province *Emamzadeh Seyyed Mohammad, Neyriz, Fars Province *Emamzadeh Mohammad, Eqlid, Fars Province *Emamzadeh Mohammad, Khuzestan *Emamzadeh Mohammad, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad *Emamzadeh Mohammad, Qazvin ","title":"Emamzadeh Mohammad"},{"id":"35275658","text":"MirrorLink is a device interoperability standard that offers integration between a smartphone and a car's infotainment system. MirrorLink transforms smartphones into automotive application platforms where apps are hosted and run on the smartphone while drivers and passengers interact with them through the steering wheel controls, dashboard buttons and touch screens of their car's In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system. MirrorLink utilizes a set of well- established, non-proprietary technologies such as IP, USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Real-Time Protocol (RTP, for audio) and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). In addition, MirrorLink uses Virtual Network Computing (VNC) as the baseline protocol to display the user interface of the smartphone applications on the infotainment system screens and to communicate user input back to the mobile device. ==Beginnings== MirrorLink started out as a research project. Researcher J√∂rg Brakensiek and Raja Bose, from Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto, US, took results from the noBounds! project invented by researcher Bernd Steinke from the Nokia Research Center in Bochum, Germany and applied them to the automotive domain. The initial approach applied by Bernd Steinke contained three specialised sub-protocols for optimal power efficiency: 2D, 3D and Media. Support for 2D graphics composition via X11 mirroring was only needed by the requirements of the chosen source device, a Nokia N800 mobile Linux device, and the desire to speed up demo availability to show mirroring use cases. OpenGL ES was used for fast 3D graphics and alpha based Porter-Duff compositing for shine-through 2D effects. To make this future relevant approach available on the limited N800 Mesa 3D was used for local playback. High Definition Media streaming was implemented via OpenMAX, RTP and a timed sideband control to allow synchronous displayed streaming of the original video file without transcoding. The Initial implementations have remoted the GUI, Games and media content of an Nokia N800 and later an N810 mobile Linux device. This demonstration of, at that time, not expected capabilities of mobile devices, was widely reported. In parallel, a member of a CE4A company, who had seen the same initial results, contacted Nokia and the collaboration between Nokia and CE4A started. First ideas have been published and demonstrated using a Nokia N810 Internet tablet at IEEE CCNC 2009 conference. Together with two other researchers, Raja Bose and Keun-Young Park, from Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto, and in close collaboration with the Consumer Electronics for Automotive (CE4A) group of German car manufacturer, the original Terminal Mode concept has been created. The name Terminal Mode originated from the name of the Expert Group within the CE4A, which created a Positioning Paper. Nokia, together with Magneti Marelli, publicly demonstrated a first Terminal Mode concept, during a Navteq Connection event, in conjunction with the Frankfurt International Auto Show (IAA) in September 2009. A first car integration was shown at Geneva Auto Show in March 2010, using a Nokia N97 prototype implementation of Terminal Mode, integrated into a Valmet concept car. A draft 0.9 specification version was released in March 2010. In July 2010 the Terminal Mode was presented, integrated to a VW Passat at MobileBeat 2010. A first real live demonstration can be seen in from September 2010, shortly before the Terminal Mode specification became public on 6 October 2010. Early adopters included Continental, Alpine, and Clarion. The collaboration between Nokia and CE4A on Terminal Mode led to the formation of the Car Connectivity Consortium. The Car Connectivity Consortium brought together major players in the automotive and mobile device industries including a large number of Tier-I suppliers and even a few network providers. On 12 September 2011, Terminal Mode was renamed as MirrorLink and became a commercial trademark owned by the Car Connectivity Consortium. As of May 2012, the Car Connectivity Consortium had 56 members, and included almost all major automobile and mobile device manufacturers in the world. ==Global standard== The Car Connectivity Consortium, made up of various auto and electronic manufacturers, has joined together to establish an industry standard for certifying apps and devices that are both safe and useful for drivers, called MirrorLink. The joint effort by car manufacturers and phone makers is aimed at developing open standards to define operations of smartphones linked to cars. A unique element of MirrorLink is its ability to show the smartphone interface from a variety of mobile OS platforms on the audio head-unit display. ==MirrorLink implementation== MirrorLink currently works with Symbian phones (only Nokia Belle phones, not S60v5 phones from many manufacturers), Samsung Galaxy series (on Android Lollipop (5.0)), Samsung support for MirrorLink ended 1st of June 2020, and Sony Xperia Z series Android phones.

Madison began guiding professionally in 1999 on Mount Rainier, and his company, Madison Mountaineering, specializes in climbs on Mount Everest and other high altitude peaks, operates on the highest peaks on all seven continents, and also provides training programs and summit climbs in Washington State. On May 19‚Äì20, 2011, he reached the summit of Mount Everest on his fourth successful attempt as expedition leader and guide for Alpine Ascents International, and reached the summit of Lhotse (the fourth highest mountain in the world) 21 hours later as guide to climber Tom Halliday. Also on the expedition was guide Michael Horst who made both summits as well in under a 24-hour period, a few days earlier. This was the first time that both Everest and Lhotse were summited together in less than 24 hours, and Madison repeated the \\"double header\\" feat again in 2013, the only person to do so twice. In 2014, Madison led the first successfully guided ascent of K2, reaching the summit with two climbers and three Sherpas on July 27, 2014. On 22 July 2018, Madison successfully led a team of 24 to the summit of K2 and became the first American to summit K2 more than once. Madison also regularly guides many \\"7 Summits\\" expeditions such as Carstensz Pyramid, Aconcagua, Vinson Massif, Kilimanjaro and Elbrus during the year. In addition, Madison is regularly involved with film productions on Everest, participating in four different features over three years. Most recently, Madison's company, Madison Mountaineering, brought a virtual reality camera to the summit of Mount Everest. As an executive producer, Garrett Madison was awarded the 2017 Sports Emmy in Outstanding Digital Innovation for the resulting SI.com/Life VR production, Capturing Everest. Madison was leading a team of climbers up Mount Everest when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake triggered an avalanche, resulting in the deadliest day in Everest's history. The team's doctor, Eve Girawong, was one of the American fatalities. Madison holds multiple high altitude mountaineering world records such as being the only person to climb Mount Everest and nearby Lhotse in a day, 3 times. He is the only American to climb K2 twice, and personally has led more climbers to the summits of Mount Everest and K2 than anyone. == Media == Outside Magazines story of the deadly September 2012 avalanche on Manaslu is supported with photos and notes of Madison's mountain rescue and recovery efforts. An interview and story of Madison's 2012 Mount Everest summit was published in the October 2012 issue of Outside Magazine. The MTN Meister Podcast featured an interview with Madison in 2014 detailing, among other things, his ascent of K2 that was the mountain's first guided climb. Outside Magazine featured Madison on the cover of their 2015 Adventure Issue. People Magazine and The Today Show both highlighted Madison's experience during the April 2015 Nepal earthquake while covering the tragedy. In July 2015, ESPN featured Madison in a video about Mount Everest.

In bacteria this pathway leads to the synthesis of isopentenyl tRNA, isoprenoid quinones, and sugar carrier lipids. Among the enzymes that participate in that pathway, are a number of polyprenyl synthetase enzymes which catalyze a 1'4-condensation between 5-carbon isoprene units.

It is native to a small area around the border between Alabama and Florida in the United States. ==Description== This plant is a perennial herb or subshrub with stiff, erect stems coming from a woody base and taproot. It may exceed one meter in height. The leathery leaves are alternately arranged. The largest near the stem bases are up to 6.8 centimeters long. They are mostly oval with smooth edges and rounded tips. The inflorescence is made up of a number of racemes of flowers. There is a white- or pinkish-flowered form and a red-flowered form. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1856 by John Kunkel Small as Polygonella macrophylla. In 2015, following a series of molecular phylogenetic studies, the genus Polygonella was subsumed into Polygonum. However, the name \\"Polygonum macrophylla\\" was unavailable, so the replacement name Polygonum smallianum was published in 2011. ==Distribution, habitat and conservation== This species occurs in the Florida scrub of the Florida Panhandle and a part of southern Alabama. It grows in open scrub and coastal dunes. Rare in general, it can be common in its range. The main threat to the species is the loss of its scrub habitat to development and silviculture. ==References smallianum Category:Flora of Alabama Category:Flora of Florida Category:Endemic flora of the United States Category:Plants described in 1856 ","title":"Polygonum smallianum"},{"id":"35275853","text":"Kushk Dar (, also Romanized as K≈´sh·∏µ Dar and Kashk Dar) is a village in Rudbar-e Shahrestan Rural District, Alamut-e Gharbi District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Cardamone lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Life== Born in Mt Airy, Pennsylvania, a historic suburb outside of Philadelphia. Her early childhood was spent exploring the woods of the Wissahickon Valley in Fairmount Park, the largest urban park system in the United States. Throughout her teenage years she pursued her love of horseback riding and art. Cardamone studied liberal arts at Rosemont College from 1977 to 1979. It was during this time she met American Realist painter Tom Palmore. She began working for him as a studio assistant in his Philadelphia studio. They became romantically involved shortly thereafter and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where they lived and worked together for many years. Recounting this period in her life Cardamone says, \\"Tom was a major influence on my life both artistically and personally. He was an amazing, insightful teacher who helped my development as an artist\\". During this time she worked on a series of painting and sculptures that were influenced by the plants and folklore of New Mexico. They eventually parted ways but remain close friends. In 1984 she moved back to Philadelphia and founded Cardamone Designs, a successful limited editions clothing design company. She ran this company from 1984 to 1999. The company became known for the revival of hippy patchwork designed items. In 1987 she married David Schlessinger. In 2002, after taking a few years off to raise her two children, she began painting again and enrolled in the Barnes Foundation Arboretum School to pursue her love of Horticulture. Her current body of work was greatly influenced by this period in her life. ==Work== Cardamone is best known for her unconventional botanically influenced works on paper that reinvents the genre of botanical illustration. Melding elements of 18th and 19th century botanical illustrations with the imaginative randomness of Berlin Dada and Surrealist collage methods, MF Cardamone creates playful interpretations of the intersection of nature, taxonomy, and popular culture. Cardamone collects plant specimens and combines them with images and words that result in complex visual narratives that reveal the science, history, and beauty of her subjects. This work is part of a series that began with research and native plant collecting that Cardamone conducted shortly after she designed a native Pennsylvania wildlife habitat garden as a result of her studies at the Barnes Foundation Arboretum School. She also finds inspiration in medieval herbals and manuscripts, folklore, traditional Chinese medicine, and Pop Art. To Cardamone, the anatomy of a plant is part of a larger story that involves its historical, medicinal, ecological, spiritual, and mythological aspects. ==See also== * MF Cardamone Website * Exhibitions ==References== Category:American contemporary artists Category:Artists from Philadelphia Category:American women artists ","title":"MF Cardamone"},{"id":"35275869","text":"Dungmali, or Dungmali-Bantawa, is a Kiranti language spoken in Nepal.

The Butterfly Clues tells the story of Penelope \\"Lo\\" Marin, an outcast teenage girl who struggles with Obsessive‚Äîcompulsive disorder (OCD) and has to deal with the constant urge to steal various items, the frequent relocation due to her father's job, and the memory of her brother Oren's death. Throughout the novel, Lo's problems arise as both weaknesses and strengths, which she is forced to deal with as she attempts to solve the murder of a young stripper. ==Plot== The Butterfly Clues written by Kate Ellison, follows the story of Penelope ‚ÄúLo‚Äù Marin and is set in Cleveland, Ohio. Before the novel starts, Lo's brother Oren ran away and was found dead in an abandoned apartment building in Neverland ‚Äúthe city of lost children‚Äù.Ellison, p. 17 Before Lo does anything she uses the sequences of multiples of threes and bananas for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. Lo is an outcast who takes items she sees as beautiful and arranges them in places ‚Äúwhere everything makes sense‚Äù.Ellison, p. 2 Lo goes to Neverland and takes a marble angel for her collections. As she turns to leave for home Lo hears sirens behind her. Lo fears that someone saw her take the angel, so she hides in an alleyway beside ‚Äúan ugly yellow house‚Äù.Ellison, p. 4 A shot is fired that kills Sapphire a ‚Äúnineteen year old . . . stripper‚Äù who has ‚Äúangry eyes, and her lips are a bruised blue-purple color ‚Äî a lipstick‚Äù Ellison, p. 18 and lived in the yellow house. Lo decides to look into Sapphire's murder. Lo goes to a flea market in Neverland to look for more items for her collections and is bumped into a nearby stand by someone running past her. At the stand Lo finds many of the Sapphire's belongings stolen when she was murdered. Lo steals a horse pendant and the owner of the stand (Mario) gives her Sapphires butterfly figurine in an effort to keep her from telling the police about the stolen items. Lo returns to Neverland to uncover more clues into Sapphire's life. She goes back to Sapphire's house to look for more clues and outside she meets the boy who pushed her into Mario's stand: Flynt. Together they break into Sapphire's \\"daisy-yellow house‚Äù Ellison, p. 128 and Lo takes three frog figurines, Sapphire's black rhinestone bustier, and her journals. While Lo looks around the house she sees pictures of Sapphire wearing her signature blue-purple lipstick, but Lo can't find the lipstick anywhere. Lo's interest in the murder leads to Lo receiving her first threat: a dead cat on her front porch with a note attached that says ‚Äúnow you know what curiosity did. Be careful, or you‚Äôll end up like the cat‚Äù.Ellison, p. 79 The first threat brings Lo to realize that before she goes to Tens (the strip club where Sapphire worked) she will need a disguise, and thus Lo becomes Juliet from her mom's unused makeup, skirt, and heels. At Tens, Lo asks Sapphire's coworkers about her and they say that she was protective of her blue lipstick, but was nice to everyone. As she's leaving, Lo trips on a curtain and lands on a man's lap: Gordon Jones. The next day, Lo receives a second threat: eight pictures of her taped to her locker with acid on them to make them look like they were being consumed by flames with the warning: ‚Äúback off bitch‚Äù Ellison, p. 154 written across the pictures. Lo goes looking for Mario and information of Sapphire's stolen items, and finds him dying in his apartment. Lo returns to Tens to see if Mario and Sapphire's murders are related and learns from another one of Sapphire's coworkers that Sapphire was receiving gifts from a man. As Lo tries to leave, she is grabbed and shoved into a corner where a man tells her ‚Äúthis [is] your final warning. There won‚Äôt be another one‚Äù.Ellison, p. 200 Lo goes to the police and tells them ‚Äúabout being pulled into a room in the back of the club by the bouncer, threatened ‚Äî the cat, the acid.

She calls her father to come pick her up and when they get home he goes to her room and ‚Äúgo[es] through [her] things...throwing them away‚Äù.Ellison, p. 259 When he finishes, Lo looks at Sapphire's broken butterfly and sees Sapphire's SIM card hidden inside. When Lo plugs the SIM card into her phone she finds threatening messages from Anchor and messages from Bird (Sapphire's boyfriend) and discovers that Bird is Oren. Lo returns to Tens, and by using Sapphire's SIM card calls Anchor and learns that he is Gordon Jones. Jones kidnaps Lo. As Jones is about to kill her Officer Gardner and Flynt save her. Officer Gardner tells Lo that Sapphire was killed because she threatened Jones with publicizing his threats to her. Lo's father comes to pick Lo up from the police station and admits that Lo is an ‚Äúamazing young woman‚Äù.Ellison, p. 306 His acceptance of Lo leads to Lo showing her father a letter from Oren before he died, which brings Lo and her father closer. Flynt and Lo decide to go to prom together where Lo finds her confidence and defends herself against the popular girl who said she didn't belong.

Lo's compulsive behaviors are ‚Äúever-present‚Äù throughout the novel. Lo is ‚Äúdrawn to multiples of three‚Äù and saying the word banana as a sense of ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. Publisher's Weekly notes that Lo's compulsions grow increasingly worse after the death of her brother Oren. Lo also has the urge to steal and hoard items that she ‚Äúcarefully organizes‚Äù in her room . Lo's hoarding grows worse into a ‚Äúfull-blown, potentially dangerous obsession\\". The people around Lo either react with ‚Äúhostility‚Äù such as Lo's father or with ‚Äútenderness and understanding‚Äù such as Flynt does. Lo's family is ‚Äúnot accepting of her condition‚Äù, and Lo is an ‚Äúoutcast‚Äù in her school. While Lo's Obsessive‚Äîcompulsive disorder ‚Äúhinders her ability to gather clues‚Äù it's also the ‚Äúforce that compels her‚Äù to continue investigating Sapphire's murder. ==Style== The Butterfly Clues is noted for its use of a narrator (Lo) in the present tense and its ‚Äúlyrical style‚Äù. The Butterfly Clues has a lyrical style and is written from Lo's perspective in the first-person narrative, which gives the book ‚Äúa kind of tension and immediacy that keeps the mystery taunt‚Äù. Sadie Magazine and School Library Journal also remarked that The Butterfly Clues had a ‚Äústrong‚Äù, ‚Äúfast moving narrative‚Äù. ==Publication History== The Butterfly Clues was published by ‚ÄúEgmont USA in collaboration with Paper Lantern Lit‚Äù. ==Reception== The Butterfly Clues received mostly positive reviews in regards to its characters and plot. The Butterfly Clues is a ‚Äúthrilling‚Äù and ‚Äúunfolding‚Äù young adult, mystery novel written by Kate Ellison. Figment Reviews found the novel to have a unique and ‚Äúanything but straightforward‚Äù plot with the romance that forms between Lo and Flynt to not be ‚Äúforced‚Äù. Kirkus Reviews described the novel as ‚Äúa pleasing mix of realism, tension, intrigue, and romance‚Äù. Sadie Magazine praised Kate Ellison for making her characters ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù with ‚Äúdistinct voices‚Äù and that the narration was written with ‚Äúmagic and lyricism‚Äù. 365 Days of Reading commented that Sapphire ‚Äúdespite being dead was a well developed character.‚Äù Portrait of a Book noted that The Butterfly Clues was truly the ‚Äústory of the characters‚Äù with ‚Äúwonderful descriptions and insights‚Äù. 365 Days of Reading wrote that The Butterfly Clues would not be as good ‚Äúif [Lo] was an ordinary girl. School Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews agreed that The Butterfly Clues is plotted well. Though 365 Days of Reading stated that The Butterfly Clues was ‚Äúa bit confusing at first,‚Äù School Library Journal and 365 Days of Reading agreed that The Butterfly Clues has a ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù and ‚Äúriveting‚Äù conclusion. 365 Days of Reading also noted that the answers to the mystery were revealed to the reader at ‚Äújust the right rate‚Äù. Publisher's Weekly added that Ellison created ‚Äúcredible (if slightly romanticized)‚Äù perspectives of both Neverland and Lo's struggle with Obsessive‚Äîcompulsive disorder that makes her a ‚Äúmemorable heroine‚Äù. Not all of The Butterfly Clues reviews were positive. 365 Days of Reading complained that ‚Äúcharacters are where the [novel] suffers a bit,‚Äù because Lo seems ‚Äúcontrolled by her condition‚Äù that she is not an easily relatable protagonist and that it was difficult to decide which characters should be trusted. 365 Days of Reading also criticized that while they found Flynt ‚Äúperplexing‚Äù they were not able to ‚Äúbuy into [him] as a genuine person‚Äù. Kirkus Reviews reprimanded Ellison because they feel that Lo confronts clues ‚Äúa bit too often to be believed‚Äù. ==BibliographyReferences== Category:American young adult novels Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels set in Cleveland ","title":"The Butterfly Clues"},{"id":"35275877","text":"Virgin boy eggs are a traditional dish of Dongyang, Zhejiang, China in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten. Named \\"tong zi dan\\" (Chinese: Á´•Â≠êËõã; pinyin: T√≥ngz«êd√†n), the dish translates literally to \\"boy egg\\" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's \\"local intangible cultural heritage\\". ==History== The dish is a long- standing tradition of Dongyang and its practices date back centuries. In general, China has had a long history of food preservation methods. Tea eggs were originally developed to preserve the food for long periods of time. While the boy eggs may not have necessarily had the same origin, their development comes from a similar cultural background. There is no good explanation for why it must be boys' urine, specifically. It has simply been so for centuries. However, it is historically believed in the region that urine has various health benefits and was commonly ingested in ancient times. In such times, eggs were one of the only nutritional food items available to peasants and farmers. Due to Zhejiang's hilly and riverside landscapes, agriculture has been a staple in the region's culture for centuries. Although rice was the most widely grown crop, most peasants raised their own pigs and poultry on their land as well. This led to the eggs' availability to the common person and, with the supposedly added benefit of urine at the time, the virgin boy eggs grew in popularity. The dish's traditional nature stems from the historical tendency of Chinese food culture to place more care on the detailed history of a specific food. Virgin boy eggs are one example of how Chinese food culture attaches more importance to the anecdotes relating to food, such as its time of invention or the significant historical figures related to the food's invention. This differs historically from the western food culture which places more importance on a dish's ingredients and the skills necessary for its preparation. Although the exact history is somewhat obscure to most official sources, the long-standing trend of Chinese food explains the people of Dongyang's loyalty to a traditional dish to which many others find an aversion. ==Preparation== The dish is prepared by first soaking the eggs in the urine of young boys. The urine is sourced locally by each vendor. Then the mixture is heated over a stove. After boiling, the egg shells are cracked around the entire surface of the egg. Afterwards, the eggs are placed back into the urine. The used urine is then replaced with fresh urine and the process is repeated. The soaking process allows the eggs to become cured in the urine as they are left to simmer. The entire process is generally a day- long endeavor. According to some recipes, different herbs may also be added to the marinade. When finished, the eggs' whites have a pale golden hue and the yolks turn green. Virgin boy eggs are similar to century eggs in their curing process and historical roots, although century eggs have become much more popularly widespread and do not use urine. ==Modern culture== Virgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures. Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine. The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill. In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys. Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs. However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, \\"The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it. It stinks.‚Äù In general, virgin boy eggs remain highly acclaimed by the people of Dongyang for both their taste and even their \\"fragrant\\" smell. ==Health effects and folk medicine== Urine therapy has been a significant part of traditional Chinese medicine for much of its history. In ancient times, urine was used as a means of enhancing the effects of medicine, although today, the practice is widely viewed as unsanitary by many. It is widely speculated, however, that when urine dries it crystallizes resulting in a substance similar to the Chinese medicine, ren zhong bai. The crystallized urine sediment is said to aid in the mitigation of inflammation and inflammatory diseases as well as fungal infections of the skin and mouth. Some claim that the ingestion of the urine-soaked eggs can treat yin deficiency, decrease one's internal body heat, and promote blood circulation. Locals claim that the eggs also prevent heat stroke. It was widely believed in ancient China that eggs cured in one's own urine for seven days and consumed for a course of three months was a cure for chronic asthma. Among other uses for urine in Chinese medicine, a young boy's first urine of the day is considered to be very powerful and may be combined with herbs to make a tonic. Modern medical practitioners remain dubious of any health benefits of urine therapy in general. Evidence-based modern medicine has determined that urine \\"is waste expelled from the human body and basically contains no substance conducive to human health.\\" ==See also== *List of egg dishes *Tea egg *Century egg *Urophagia ==References== Category:Chinese cuisine Category:Traditions Category:Cultural heritage of China Category:Traditional knowledge Category:Cultural anthropology Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage ","title":"Virgin boy egg"},{"id":"35275880","text":"The Holy Days and Fasting Days Act 1551 (5 & 6 Edw 6 c 3) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in 14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, employees who were covered under union contracts, often referred to as bargaining unit members, had been able to raise any claims of civil rights violations by their employer in court. This had been the case regardless of the language which was stated in their union contract, a document often referred to as a collective bargaining agreement, or CBA. ==Facts== Steven Pyett, Thomas O' Connell and Michael Phillips worked for Temco Service Industries, Inc., a maintenance service and cleaning contractor in New York City. Pyett and O'Connell were night watchmen and Phillips held a similar position as a night-starter at an office building owned by Pennsylvania Building Company and 14 Penn Plaza, LLC. The men were members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 32BJ. Their positions at Temco were covered under a collective bargaining agreement that their union Local 32BJ had signed with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations (RAB). The RAB represented both Temco and 14 Penn Plaza in labor matters.14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett,(07-581), FACTS -https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-581 In August 2003, after receiving consent from the SEIU Local 32BJ, 14 Penn Plaza hired the unionized firm Spartan Security to provide licensed security guard services. Newly contracted security guards were assigned to the building where Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips worked, and Temco reassigned the men to other positions in the same building as night porters and light duty cleaners. \\"As the only building employees over the age of 50,\\"Pyett, 498 F.3d at 90. Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips believed that their job reassignments to less desirable and less lucrative positions were the result of age discrimination and requested that their union file a grievance over the matter. The workers' age discrimination claims progressed through four stages spanning five years on its way to the Supreme Court. Here is a summary of that path.  Grievance and arbitration  The union filed grievances alleging that Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips' job reassignments had violated the collective bargaining agreement by: #discriminating against Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips on account of their age, #neglecting seniority rights by not promoting either Pyett or O'Connell to an assistant mechanic position, and #negatively affecting each of the three worker's wages by rotating overtime inequitably.14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 253. Arbitrator Earl Pfeffer held his initial hearing on the Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips grievances on February 2, 2004. A few weeks later, in a letter dated February 23, 2004, the union withdrew the charge of age discrimination from the grievances.Pyett v. Pennsylvania Building Co., 04 Civ. 7536 (NRB) US District Court For the Southern District of New York Having previously agreed to the hiring of the licensed security guards, the union believed it could not \\"legitimately object to [the workers'] reassignments as discriminatory.\\" After several hearings, the arbitrator rendered his opinion on August 10, 2005, denying the other grievance claims.14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, No. 07-581,(4/1/09), page 3, available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-581.pdf  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  On May 26, 2004, Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips each filed age discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After reviewing the evidence, the EEOC dismissed each of the men's complaints. Per the agency's practice when its investigation does not substantiate a charge that has been made,\\"The Charge Handling Process,\\" U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, available at: http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/process.cfm the EEOC issued each man a letter of Dismissal and Notice of Rights. The letters notified the men of their right to file a lawsuit in court.  District court  On August 21, 2004, Pyett, O' Connell and Phillips sued SEIU Local 32BJ. Their lawsuit claimed that the union had breached its duty of fair representation when it withdrew their age discrimination grievance charges. The workers later dropped their lawsuit against the union after the arbitrator rendered his decision on their remaining grievances in August 2005. Then, on September 23, 2004, the men filed a lawsuit against Pennsylvania Building Company,14 Penn Plaza, LLC and Temco in District Court. The lawsuit charged that their job reassignments were in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The companies filed a motion to dismiss the charges as well as a motion to compel arbitration under sections 3 and 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) [9 U. S. C. ¬ß¬ß3]. On May 31, 2006, District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald denied both motions. In denying the motion to compel arbitration, Judge Buchwald cited a phrase that would later be used by the Supreme Court in their decision to reverse the Court of Appeals ruling. She cited that it was \\"binding‚Ä¶ precedent that even a clear and unmistakable union-negotiated waiver of a right to litigate certain‚Ä¶ claims in a judicial forum is unenforceable.\\" Pyett v. Pennsylvania Building Co., 04 Civ. 7536 (NRB) US District Court For the Southern District of New York, emphasis added  U.S. Court of Appeals  On June 1, 2006, Pennsylvania Building Company,14 Penn Plaza, LLC and Temco appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit under section 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act. Their appeal again sought to compel the plaintiffs to resolve their claims of age discrimination through arbitration. On August 1, 2007, Appeals Court Judge Jos√© Cabranes upheld the District Court's decision to deny the companies' motion to compel arbitration. In his decision he wrote that \\"mandatory arbitration clauses in collective bargaining agreements are unenforceable to the extent that they waive the rights of covered workers to a judicial forum for federal statutory causes of action.\\" The judge continued that \\"the District Court recognized‚Ä¶ the distinction our Court has drawn between arbitration clauses in individual contracts‚Ä¶ and arbitration clauses in [collective bargaining agreement]s.\\" The former, he wrote, was \\"governed by a line of Supreme Court cases represented by Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp..\\"Pyett, 498 F.3d at 92.. The later was governed \\"by a line of Supreme Court cases represented by Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.\\". ==Judgment== A sharply divided Supreme Court delivered a 5‚Äì4 decision in favor of 14 Penn Plaza and overturning the Second Circuit judge's decision. In doing so, the Court ruled that some collective bargaining agreements do require employees to pursue legal action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 through arbitration rather than in court. The Court also ruled that the CBA in this case did require ADEA claims to be arbitrated. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the Court's opinion. He was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Samuel Alito. In its decision, the Court flipped the Second Circuit's reasoning by rejecting the Gardner-Denver line of precedent and embracing that of its 1991 decision in Gilmer. In doing so, the Court eliminated the widely held legal distinction between mandatory arbitration agreements, like the one that had been upheld in Gilmer, and collective bargaining agreements, like the ones at issue in both Gardner-Denver and 14 Penn Plaza. This distinction, Justice Souter pointed out in his dissent, had consistently been observed by each of the U.S. Appeals Courts except the Fourth Circuit.14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, No. 07-581 slip opinion (U.S. April 1, 2009), Souter, J., dissenting, Page 5, available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-581.pdf One major difference between the two types of agreements is that the former is signed directly by the individual effected by it, while the latter is signed by a union representative. Another difference is that the implementation of mandatory arbitration agreements is governed by a 1925 law called the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Union contracts, on the other hand, are governed by a different law passed in 1935 called the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) NLRA 29 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 151-169, available at: http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor- relations-act and enforced by an \\"independent federal agency\\"\\"Who Are We,\\" National Labor Relations Board, http://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are called the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

The 14 Penn Plaza majority opinion discerned that Gardner-Denver was decided correctly \\"on the narrow ground‚Ä¶ that the collective bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\\" However, the majority strongly disputed Gardner- Denver and its descendant cases',Cases decided upon Gardner-Denver include: ; and . \\"broad dicta\\" (\\"Judicial dictum is an opinion by a court on a question that is not essential to its decision even though it may be directly involved.\\") as based on a \\"misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 265.

The first misconception it identified was that to \\"submit statutory discrimination claims to arbitration was tantamount to a waiver of those rights.\\" Rather, they concluded, \\"it waives only the right to seek relief from a court.\\" The second misconception was that arbitrators \\"competence‚Ä¶ to decide legal issue[s],\\" as well the \\"informality\\" and \\"fact finding process\\" of arbitration make it an unsuitable venue to decide people's legal rights.14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 269. Justice Thomas added that \\"the informality of arbitration is one of the chief reasons that parties select\\" it, and that arbitration's \\"more streamlined\\" procedures did not render them \\"inadequate.\\" The third misconception that the Court's opinion sought to refute was regarding the real or potential conflict of interest between a union as a whole and the individual members that make up its bargaining unit. Nothing in the text of the ADEA, the majority wrote, would justify \\"singling out an arbitration provision for disfavored treatment\\" \\"simply because of an alleged conflict of interest between a union and its members.\\" It added \\"In any event, Congress has accounted for this conflict of interest\\" by allowing bargaining unit members to take legal action against their union with the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 271. Lastly, the 14 Penn Plaza majority turned its attention to \\"respondents‚Ä¶ series of arguments contending that the particular CBA at issue does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims.\\" These arguments centered around the collective bargaining agreement's provision that they gave the union, rather than individual bargaining unit members, complete control over whether, and for how long, to pursue a grievance. Therefore, \\"[a]bsent any [individual employee's] arbitration right, there is no‚Ä¶ support [for] a motion to compel arbitration.\\" 14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, No. 07-581, Brief for the Respondents, Page 2, available at: http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_07_08_07_581_Respondent.authcheckdam.PDF While the Court notes that it could still consider these arguments even though council for Pyett, O'Connell and Phillips had not raised them in the lower courts, it chose not to, citing a precedent set in Heckler v. Campbell..'14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, No. 07-581, slip opinion (U.S. April 1, 2009), Opinion of the Court, Page 24, available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-581.pdf In that decision, the Court stated that it would address arguments that had not been raised in the lower courts \\"only in exceptional cases.\\" The 14 Penn Plaza majority followed with \\"This is not an \\"exceptional case,\\" and added that this issue \\"was not fully briefed to this or any court.\\" Consequently, the Court \\"hesitat[ed] to invalidate arbitration agreements on the basis of speculation.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 274. The Court concluded that the CBA at issue in this case \\"clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age- discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.\\" 14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, No. 07-581, slip opinion (U.S. April 1, 2009), Syllabus, Page 2, available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-581.pdf  Souter's dissent  Justice David Souter authored one of two dissenting opinions. He was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. In Justice Souter's dissent, he disputes what he refers to as the majority's \\"bald assertion that \\"[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.\\" The \\"applicability of the Gardner-Denver rule\\" to this case, he writes, is \\"unquestionable\\" and that \\"[o]nce we have construed a statute, stability is the rule and‚Ä¶ [t]here is no argument for abandoning precedent here.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 281 (Souter, J. dissenting). The dissenting justices claim that the majority \\"misreads the case\\" of Gardner-Denver by concluding that its outcome hinged solely upon the scope, or specific language, of the collective bargaining agreement. \\"One need only read Gardner-Denver itself to know that it was not at all so narrowly reasoned.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 282 (Souter, J. dissenting). Quoting from the text of the ADEA, Justice Souter notes that \\"'Any person aggrieved' under the Act 'may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for legal or equitable relief' 29 U.S.C. ¬ß6269(c).\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 278 (Souter, J. dissenting). The minority contends that \\"Congress itself has unsurprisingly understood Gardner-Denver the way we have repeatedly explained it and has operated on the assumption that a CBA cannot waive employees' rights to a judicial forum to enforce antidiscrimination statutes.\\" They continue, \\"Congress has had [over] 30 years in which it could have corrected our decision ‚Ä¶ if it disagreed with it, and has not chosen to do so.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 285 (Souter, J. dissenting). Finally, Justice Souter speculates that the majority opinion may have a limited effect because it \\"explicitly\\" leaves unanswered the question of whether or not \\"a CBA's waiver of judicial forum is enforceable when the union controls access to and presentation of employees' claims in arbitration.\\"  Stevens' dissent  In addition to signing onto Justice Souter's dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens authored an additional dissent. Justice Stevens criticized the majority for what he considered its \\"subversion of precedent.\\" He expressed his opposition not only to the Court's \\"policy favoring arbitration\\" in the 14 Penn Plaza and Gilmer decisions, but also in a series of decisions from 1981 to 2001.See ; ; Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 36; and . In these cases, he wrote, \\"my colleagues were making policy choices not made by Congress.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 275 (Stevens, J. dissenting). Writing about Gardner-Denver, he concluded with \\"[i]n the absence of an intervening amendment\\" from Congress, we are \\"bound by that decision.\\"14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.S. at 277 (Stevens, J. dissenting). ==Significance== The Supreme Court has since reversed several additional lower court rulings involving mandatory arbitration. 14 Penn Plaza has been heavily criticized in academic literature,See E McGaughey, 'Fascism-Lite in America (or the social idea of Donald Trump)' (2018) British Journal of American Legal Studies (arguing that like the Lochner era made social rights void, a new Concepcion era put rights up \\"for sale\\") and M Finkin, 'Workplace Justice: Does Private Judging Matter?' (2014) Zeitschrift f√ºr Vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft 2/2014 and calls for its reversal through an Arbitration Fairness Act have been made.  Stolt-Nielsen v. Animalfeeds International Corp.  On April 27, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision regarding class action arbitration in Stolt-Nielsen v. Animalfeeds International Corp. Stolt-Nielsen v. Animalfeeds International Corp., No. 08-1198, slip op. (U.S. April 27, 2010) Both parties had agreed that their arbitration agreement was silent on the issue of class actions. A panel of arbitrators decided that the customer could pursue class arbitration. Their decision was ultimately reversed by the Supreme Court.  AT&T; Mobility v. Concepcion  On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed a United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision in AT & T Mobility v. Concepcion.. Customers brought a class action suit against their cell phone company for false advertising and fraud. The Ninth Circuit court determined that the contract's arbitration clause, which precluded class arbitration, was unconscionable under California's Discover Bank rule. The rule allowed for a class action suit \\"where a party with superior bargaining power was alleged to have cheated large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.\\"Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 340. The Supreme Court overruled this decision, holding that section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act preempted the California rule.  Marmet Health Care Center v. Brown  On February 21, 2012, the Supreme Court overruled a Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia decision involving a state lawsuit brought by three families of nursing home patients in Marmet Health Care Center v. Brown. The state supreme court of appeals had allowed the family members of three nursing home patients who had died to sue the nursing homes for negligence. In doing so, it upheld a West Virginia state law prohibiting pre-dispute agreements that mandate arbitration of personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against nursing homes. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that the state rule violated the Federal Arbitration Act and vacated the state court's judgment..  Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011  The Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011 [S.987] was introduced in May 2011 by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Al Franken (D-MN) and 11 Senate co-sponsors. A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives [H.R. 1873] by Representative Henry \\"Hank\\" Johnson [D-GA] The bill, first introduced to Congress in 2007,\\"Sens. Franken, Blumenthal, Rep.

The House Judiciary Committee referred the bill to the Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law on June 1, 2011. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the Arbitration Fairness Act on October 13, 2011.  Community support for the bill  A wide coalition of organizations including social justice, public interest, labor, consumer protection, civil rights, housing and homeowner, health care advocacy, legal advocacy and other community groups are supporting the passage of the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011 S.987 and H.R.1873.Bill Summary & Status 112th Congress (2011-2012), S.987 and H.R.1873.

An engraving from the printed edition of 1823, published by the Bannatyne Club. The Buke of the Howlat, often referred to simply as The Howlat, is a humorous 15th century Scots poem by Richard Holland. ==Description== The poem is a comic allegory in which all the characters are birds with human attributes, with a howlat, or owl, the protagonist. The symbolism is debatable but two of its purposes are clear; it serves as a moral fable warning against vanity and excessive pride, and it is also a piece of propaganda praising the Douglas dynasty of Scots nobles.The Printed Edition of 1823 (Bannatyne Club) Other themes dealt with in the work include satire of the bureaucracy of the medieval church, and the mocking of Highland Scots and their language. The Howlat is a long, narrative piece full of exuberant comic detail. It is written in rhyming verse heavy with alliteration. The text is preserved in the Asloan and Bannatyne manuscripts. A printed transcript, based mainly on the Asloan text was published by the Bannatyne Club in 1823. ==Synopsis== An owl, unhappy with his appearance, decides to appeal to the Pope (a peacock), to be made more handsome. The Pope, assisted by his secretary (a turtledove) and his herald (a swallow) calls a council to discuss the matter. Church dignitaries assemble first, followed by lay representatives led by the Emperor, an eagle. A long interlude of praise for the Douglas family follows. It includes a retelling of the career of Sir James Douglas. The narrative resumes with the Pope holding a banquet for his guests. A series of entertainers are presented in vivid comic detail; The mavis leads a band of musicians; the jay performs juggling; the rook, as a highland bard, gives a recitation in mock Gaelic before being driven out by two fools (a peewit and a gowk). The fools then quarrel with each other. After the feast, the council agrees to meet the owl's request and, after praying to Dame Nature she descends from heaven and arranges a beautiful new plumage for the owl. Each of the assembled birds is required to give up one of his feathers. Due to his grand new appearance, the owl becomes extremely arrogant and the birds pray again to Dame Nature; this time they request that the owl's gift be revoked. Nature agrees and, deprived of his fine plumage, the owl reflects bitterly on the lesson he has learnt about pride and vanity. ==Representative passage== The following stanzas describe some of the entertainment at the birds' feast. They open with the entrance of the bard, who demands food and drink in exchange for his recitation on Irish royal genealogy.

In 1803, the newly appointed commander of Russian forces in the Caucasus, Paul Tsitsianov, attacked Ganja. After Mohammad Khan Qajar invasion of Tbilisi, which Javad Khan fought alongside Agha Mu·∏•ammad KhƒÅn, Tsitsianov wrote a letter to Javad Khan, demanding a voluntary surrender: {  - The first and main reason I came here is that since the time of Queen Tamara of Georgia, Ganja was owned by the Georgian kings, but because of weakness of them, taken away from Georgia. Russian Empire, taking Georgia into its high-performance protection and citizenship, can not look with indifference to the dissolution of Georgia, and God ascended the Russian empire to keep Ganja. Ganja is through property and part of Georgia, in the hands of strangers.I offer you the surrender the city, come and give the city with the troops, and I, because of the European manner and faith I professed, should not start to shed human blood. But if tomorrow at noon, do not get an answer, the battle will begin, carried by fire and sword, and you will know if I could keep my word. } Javad Khan answered: {  - ... you wrote:\\" In the era of Tamar, the land of Dedeh-faal of Ganja was subordinate to Georgia.No one has ever heard of such words. But know that our ancestors like Abbas Qoli Khan and others were rulers of Georgia and if you do not believe this, then ask the old folks of Georgia with regards to the Abbas Qoli Khan and ask them if he was the ruler or not.[As a sign of this proof,] currently, his mosque and market place are in Georgia. And the kingly clothes bestowed upon his servants as well as his letters/documents are with the people of Georgia. From the days of the Erekli Khan's father and our father, the borders between Ganja and Georgia were clearly defined. And we do not need to mention these facts, because if we say that our ancestors were the sovereigns of Georgia, no one on your side will believe it and they will not bestow Georgia upon us... ...You also wrote, six years ago, I gave away the fort of Ganja to the ruler of Russia. This is true, at that time, your ruler wrote letters to all the provinces of Iran and also to us and we accepted the letter and gave the fort. Whenever the king[of Russia] wrote us a decree with regards to Ganja, then make that decree clear so that we may observe that decree and apply it. And you wrote to us \\"We were a client of Georgia\\", then know it that right now the letter of your king [the king of Russia] is in our hands and in that letter, you can see that our title was Beglarbegi of Ganja and not a client of Georgia and thus your words are in contradiction with your [own] decree. And the other thing that when we get under the rule of the Russian king, the Iranian king were to Khorasan and we could not reach him, and due to that [fact] the king of Russia is also great, we accepted his obedience, but now, thanks to god, the Iranian king is near and his servant general has come to us and also his army, and more of them will come [to help us]... ...And whenever you seek for a battle, know that we are ready for battle and if you boast about your cannon and guns, thanks to the mercy God, our cannon and guns is no less than yours. And if your cannons are one gaz know that our cannons are three/four gazs and victory is [only] due to God. And how do you know if you are braver than the Qizilbash, you have seen yourself fighting but have not seen the fighting of the Qizilbash. And you have written that to us to be ready for battle. From the time that you came to Shamss al-Dinlu and brought our people under your command, we have been preparing and we are ready for the day of battle if you want to fight. And when you wrote:\\" If you do not accept our words in this letter then misfortune will strike\\", we know such thoughts have brought you here. Fate has brought you from Saint Petersburg to that misfortune here. With the will of God, the highest, may your misfortune become apparent. } Paul Tsitsianov After this response, the Russian troops moved forward and opened gunfire. Javad Khan defended heroically and the siege lasted a month, Tsitsianov renewed demands to surrender for five times, but to no avail.\\"I'll take the fortress and I will deliver thee to death,\\" - he wrote and the stubborn Khan answered: \\"You'll find me dead on the fortress wall !\\", and both vowed to fulfil his promises. Finally, the 14th in January 1804, the Russian council of war decided to do: \\"Be the assault the next day\\". ==Battle== Adolf Charlemagne \\"Battle of Ganja\\". Tsitsianov divided the Russian troops into two columns, one was entrusted to Major-General Portnyagin (Karabagh gate) and the other to Colonel Pavel Karyagin (Tbilisi Gate). Early morning (5.00 am ), January 15, the column of Portnyagin, approached the Karabagh gate and pierced a hole in the ground before the wall, but because the defenders have focused their main forces on the site of the gap then Portnyagin left it aside and stormed the ramparts with ladders. The resistance he met was so great that the Russian troops resumed the attack twice, and twice were repulsed with considerable loss. Then Portniagin rushed himself at the head of the column and first went to the wall, followed by a Lieutenant of the regiment of the Narva that fell, struck by several bullets. Then Major Bartenev of Caucasus Grenadier Regiment fell and finally, it was Lieutenant Colonel Simanovich Grenadiers that managed to climb the stairs to the wall and help out Portnyagina. Meanwhile, the second column, led by Colonel Karyagin, ascended the wall from the gate of Tbilisi, and took possession of the main tower. The other two towers were taken one by one by major Lisanevich. Javad Khan, who did not want to seek safety in flight, took the gun and sword in hand and defended himself until he has been killed by captain Kalovski, who himself was immediately killed by the defenders. Khan's death brought confusion into the ranks of the defenders, but they still showed resistance and piled heavy stones. The city at this time was in terrible confusion. Crowds of the people, on horse and foot, rushed in disorder on the streets, vainly searching for already deceased Khan. Bewildered residents hid in their homes and barns, women filled the air with frantic cries. Meanwhile, Russian soldiers with bayonets cleared the street, entirely covered with dead bodies, and seized the booty, finding on a horseback some precious gold jewellery. By noon the battle began to subside, and broke again only for a moment when, according to Tstsianov, the soldiers came upon five hundred men, who have entrenched themselves in the Juma mosque. At first they offered to surrender, but when one Armenian said that among them are some Lezgins, it was the signal for the death of all defenders, because the hatred of Lezghins was so strong among the Russian troops.–í–ª–∞–¥—ã–∫–∏–Ω –ú. –ù. –ü—É—Ç–µ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –∏ —Å–æ–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –≤ –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ –ø–æ –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—É. ‚Äî 2-–µ –∏–∑–¥.. ‚Äî –ú., 1885. ‚Äî –°. 261.–ë–∞–±–∞–µ–≤ –≠. –ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ì—è–Ω–¥–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ö–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞. ‚Äî –ë.: –ù—É—Ä–ª–∞–Ω, 2003. ‚Äî –°. 104. ‚Äî 232 —Å.–•–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –ò. –ó–∞ –¶–∞—Ä—è, –∑–∞ –†–æ–¥–∏–Ω—É, –∑–∞ –≤–µ—Ä—É! –ì–µ—Ä–æ–∏ –∏ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∞—Ä–º–∏–∏ (1695-1918). ‚Äî –ú.: –§–µ–Ω–∏–∫—Å, 2000. ‚Äî –°. 102. ‚Äî 303 —Å.–ë–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ü. –û. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Äi—è 13-–≥–æ –õ–µ–π–±—ä-–ì—Ä–µ–Ω–∞–¥–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞–≥–æ –≠—Ä–∏–≤–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞–≥–æ –ï–≥–æ –í–µ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∫–∞ –∑–∞ 250 –ª—£—Ç—ä. –ß–∞—Å—Ç—å —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å—è. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1893. ‚Äî –°. 214. ‚Äî 393 —Å. Tsitsianov deeply appreciated the effort of the soldiers in the capture of the fortress and wrote:\\"...this is proof of moral superiority of Russian Empire over Persians and that spirit of confidence in the victory, will feed and warm up the soldiers that I consider as my first purpose\\". The elder son of Javad Khan, Hossein Quli khan, was also killed during the battle, the rest of the khan's family was taken prisoner and years later (1812) were given permission to go to Iran via Baku. His younger son, Ughurlu, survived, went to Iran and later fought the Russian Empire when the Iranians attacked Ganja in the second Russo-Persian war. page 117 Massacre Various Persian and western historians have written on the dimensions of the massacre that took place after the fall of the city. Etemad ol saltane (an Iranian historian) states that the massacre that ensued after the battle continued for three days, Hedayat has a more accurate time of three hours, Abbasgulu Bakikhanov mentions the massacrepage 209 but does not give more information. It is estimated that about 1,500-3,000 men died. Shah's response At the beginning of the battle, Javad khan sent a messenger to Fath Ali Shah and asked reinforcement. Shah gathered a 30,000 strong force and sent them to Ganja, but the force did not reach the Ganja in time because of the coldness of January and also because Hossein Khan Sardar, the governor khan of the Erevan Khanate had rebelled against the Shah and only one letter carrier, Saied Bayk, reached the town in time. ==Aftermath== Taking Ganja was an event of extraordinary importance because it was considered a fortress key to the northern provinces of Persia. Therefore, wishing to show that the Russian would never leave the conquered territory, the very name of Ganji should be cut off from people's memory, so Tsitsianov change the name of the city to Elisabethpol, after the wife of Alexander I of Russia, Elisabeth. Referring to the place by its old name became a crime punishable by a fine, the main mosque was turned into a church, and Russian law replaced Islamic law. However, as Swietochowski notes, the name \\"Elisabethpol\\" never found acceptance amongst the Azerbaijanis, who continued to call the town Ganja.Swietochowski, Tadeusz. Russian Azerbaijan, 1905-1920: The Shaping of a National Identity in a Muslim Community Cambridge University Press, 7 Jun. 2004 page 4 Javad Khan's wives and other relatives who survived the battle but had not escaped to Iran (as had most of his sons) were arrested. They were held as prisoners in the citadel until 1812, when they were freed by Tsitsianov's successor Philip Paulucci, who held the view, novel among Russian officials, that Javad Khan was a valiant man who died fighting to defend his interests. With Tsitianov's attack on Ganja, the Iranians saw a direct invasion of their country's territory. The issue was now no longer to impose tribute on the Lezgins or about re-asserting Persian domination over Christian Georgia, which had happened several years before; now, the integrity of Shi'ite Iran itself had been violated by the invasion of the town of Ganja. Immigration Two years after the Russian occupation of Ganja, Oghorulou khan, the son of Javad khan with the assistance of crown prince Abbas Mirza, displaced many inhabitants of Ganja to inside the Iranian border, so protection of 6,000 families of inhabitants of Ganja was entrusted to Pir-Gholi khan Qajar, who displaced them to Tabriz. Then again in 1809, the Bozchalou and Ayromlou tribes of Ganja get to Nakhchivan, and they were renamed to Qarapapaq (Black hat in Azeri language), and finally after Nakhjavan was ceded to Russia, they went to Solduz (Naqadeh), that is a place in Iranian West Azerbaijan Province. Other main places of Qarapapaq residence are the provinces of Ardahan (around Lake √áƒ±ldƒ±r), Kars and Iƒüdƒ±r in Turkey. ==Notes== a.

The compressor with a drive power of up to 50 MW circulates the nitrogen gas around the circuit. To achieve the desired low temperature of the gas flow and to compensate for the heat input caused by viscous friction in the flow, liquid nitrogen with a temperature of minus 196¬∞C is continuously injected into the tunnel flow through four rakes with some 270 spray nozzles in the short leg of the circuit upstream of the compressor. This liquid nitrogen vaporizes immediately and thus forms the cold gas flow. The corresponding gaseous nitrogen exhaust is located in the other short leg of the circuit upstream of the stilling chamber and is controlled by valves to maintain constant pressure inside the tunnel.etw.de Test Section Test section details: *Dimensions (HxWxL): 2.00m x 2.40 m x 9.00 m (incl. re- entry). *Wall Configuration: :Top and bottom walls : 6 slots each, with 6.25% porosity, wall angle remotely adjustable :Side walls : 4 slots each, with 7.4% porosity *Re-entry area : provided by movable finger flaps (one per slot)etw.de An exchangeable model cart system is present to increase the productivity. ==Tunnel instrumentation== The instrumentation facilities include flange type strain gauge balances, servoaccelerometer inclinometer, Kulite measurement system, Deformation Measurement System, Temperature Sensitive Paint System and mini tufts.eswirp.eu == References  External links == * http://www.etw.de/ Category:Wind tunnels ","title":"European Transonic Wind Tunnel"},{"id":"35276036","text":"Shahrestan-e Sofla (, also Romanized as ShahrestƒÅn-e Sofl√°; also known as ShahrestƒÅn-e PƒÅ‚Äôƒ´n) is a village in Rudbar-e Shahrestan Rural District, Alamut-e Gharbi District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

His father was a farm labourer and John was one of 11 or 12 children, not all of whom survived childhood.Rylatt and Adams, p. 4 He was educated at a Dame School near Kirkby Woodhouse, from 2 years of age, then at the local Board School. His formal education ended at aged 10 when, because of the poverty of his family, he went to work on Labour in Vain Farm near Bilsthorpe.Rylatt and Adams, p. 8 He earned one shilling a week, plus his board, and, other than Christmas Day and Good Friday, had only one day off each year. Aged 12, he went to Nottingham Goose Fair to find work and was employed by the squire of Annesley Woodhouse. He worked here for 12 years, during which he gained a reputation as the best shepherd in the area.Rylatt and Adams, p. 9 In 1897, aged 22 years, Shelton moved to Coventry, where he found lodgings in Thomas Street and began work as a drayman for the London and North Western Railway. He attended and was Sunday School teacher at the Wesleyan Chapel in Warwick Lane, now Methodist Central Hall, where he met Catherine Ashton at the Young People's Bible Class. In 1899, the Marriage Register of Warwick Lane recorded that John Bailey Shelton, aged 24, Drayman, living at 39 Greyfriars Lane, married Mary Catherine Ashton, aged 20, Spinster, Ribbon Weaver, of 30 Albion Street. Their son, Bailey, was born in their home in Cow Lane, and they later moved to Sackville Street where Kathleen, their daughter was born.Rylatt and Adams, p. 10 By 1907, having saved the sum of ¬£100, Shelton started his own haulage business in Little Park Street, initially working for the cardboard box makers, Bushill's, whose factory was in Cow Lane. He moved to Little Park Street where he could keep his horses on the premises. By the outbreak of World War 1, Shelton was the owner of a thriving business, with six cart horses. In 1923, Shelton was elected to the Board of Guardians, and worked with the chairman of the board, Joseph Allen, with particular concern for the residents of the workhouse in Gulson Road and the poor of Coventry. For many years he visited the residents each Sunday, taking bags of sweets to distribute. ==Archaeology== Shelton's active involvement in archaeology began in 1927. In an unpublished paper, \\"22 years of excavation\\", Shelton wrote that he researched ancient Coventry when he was in hospital for nine weeks with a fractured right leg. Later during convalescence, mobile on crutches, he watched the builders Messrs. Harris and Sons excavating on the site of the Hare and Squirrel, in Cheylesmore, only a short distance from his home in Little Park Street.Quoted in His record of the excavation, later lost in the fire in his library during the Blitz, refers to finding sandstone walls, a medieval stone-lined well, fourteenth century pottery and encaustic tiles, which he interpreted as evidence of a chapel of Greyfriars, built about 1234. As the medieval city of Coventry was demolished in the 1930s, Shelton took an amateur interest in the excavations and was often seen, in white coat and straw hat, climbing in the excavations and rubble. As a result, he collected a considerable number of historical items and opened his own museum in his shed in Little Park Street, later to be renamed as the Benedictine Museum. These would later form the core of the archaeological collections of the new Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. Shelton wrote regular articles during the 1930s detailing his finds, and these were published in Austin's Monthly Magazine. The bombing of Coventry in 1940 destroyed many of Shelton's papers and books when his house and stables were set on fire. He was later awarded the Queen Victoria Medal of the RSPCA for the courage he displayed in rescuing his horses. As his home had been destroyed, Shelton and his wife, who had been injured in the blast, and died in 1946, moved into a caravan in Little Park Street with his museum in what remained of the house.Rylatt and Adams, p. 14 He later moved to Priory Street, built over the old St Michael's cemetery.Rylatt and Adams, p. 15 Following the Blitz, Shelton explored the damaged Ford's Hospital, Coventry and discovered encaustic tiles that suggested that the hospital was built on top of the site of an old chapel. Shelton was appointed as City Chamberlain of Coventry on 20 March 1945, an office of the city council since 1269, and held by two men each year. His main duty was to be Visitors Guide of St Mary's Hall, and he received an honorarium of 100 guineas a year. In 1956 he was awarded the MBE for his services to the history, archaeology and people of Coventry. Shelton died 29 November 1958, one week after being hit by a motorcycle while out walking in the Green Lane area. Since 1959, the John Shelton Memorial Lecture has been held in his name, and Shelton Square is named after him. ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links == *John Bailey Shelton MBE ‚Äì 1930s Austin's Monthly Magazine articles Category:1875 births Category:1958 deaths Category:English archaeologists Category:People from Kirkby-in-Ashfield Category:People from Coventry Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Herbert Art Gallery and Museum ","title":"John Bailey Shelton"},{"id":"35276116","text":"Clifford Spear Gardner (January 14, 1924 ‚Äì September 25, 2013) was an American mathematician specializing in applied mathematics. ==Career== Gardner studied at Phillips Academy and Harvard, where he earned his baccalaureate in 1944.

Mann, the director of the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park She traveled around the world with her husband, raised baby animals at home, authored several books, and worked to promote the Smithsonian and the National Zoo. Mann served as an editor for the National Zoo for fifteen years. == Early life == Mann was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She graduated from the University of Michigan in 1919 with a BA in English. There, she worked on the student literary magazine The Inlander. == Early career == Mann began her career during World War I, translating Italian newspapers and communiques for the US War Department. When the war ended in November 1919, Mann accepted a job as the assistant editor of the USDA's Bureau of Entomology. Mann left Washington, D.C. in 1922 and moved to New York City, where she became a junior editor at The Woman's Home Companion. In 1926, Lucy Quarry married William M.

Retrieved August 10, 2020. == Smithsonian years == As wife of the director of the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park, Mann assisted her husband by taking care of animals in their home, entertaining guests, and helping with administrative work. After writing an article about tropical fish that appeared in The Woman's Home Companion, Mann was asked to write a book. The resulting project was Tropical Fish: A Practical Guide for Beginners. Mann's zoo experience also inspired a second book, this one titled Friendly Animals: A Book of Unusual Pets. Mann accompanied her husband on fact-finding trips to other zoos and field work expeditions around the world, including to Argentina, British Guiana, Liberia, and the East Indies. On one trip to Indonesia, they brought 900 animals (many of which found homes at the Maryland Zoo) back to Washington, D.C. Together, Lucile and William Mann traveled to countries on nearly every continent. Mann kept detailed field notes on every trip she took.

After recovering an early fumble, Moline‚Äôs center Soderstrom was called for illegal flying tackles which aided the Independents in getting the ball down to the Moline 5 yard line. Roy Salzmann was called from tackle to the backfield on a 3rd and goal from the 5 yard line. Salzmann took his first carry and was met at the 3 yard line by several Illini players. On 4th down from the 3 Salzmann shot towards the line and dove over coming down head first for what would eventually be the game winning score. MacManus at quarter had several nice runs and many long kick returns. On defense, center Caulfield repeatedly broke into the Illini backfield to break up plays.http://www.rockislandindependents.com/NFL_scores/1912/1912week1box.htm  Game 2: vs. Columbus Junction  Yesterday the city of Rock Island hosted its first football game since 1908. The visitors were the undefeated Columbus Junction team from Iowa. For the game the Independents were able to secure big guard Roy Smith who weighs in at 230 pounds. Kickoff was at 3 O‚Äôclock, for the first part of the first quarter neither team could move the ball. The Independents made some adjustments and instead of line smashes and end runs they utilized the forward pass. Late in the first quarter MacManus found the end Murphy along the sideline and he raced 30 yards and in for the score. Some good defense and a Rock Island fumble at the 1 yard line prevented the Independents from scoring again in the half. In the third quarter MacManus took the snap from center and burst through a hole in the line, several Columbus Junction players got their hands on MacManus as he ran through the broken field for 40 yards and the second Independents touchdown. Columbus Junction played a good game on defense but only got a couple first downs, never threatened to score and only got out of their territory once or twice. The Independents showed ability to adapt their attack and had scoring opportunities.http://www.rockislandindependents.com/NFL_scores/1912/1912week2box.htm  Game 3: vs. Davenport Independents  Davenport weighed in 10 pounds heavier per man but Rock Island was able to hold to remain undefeated. Harry Coleman, Arthur Salzmann and Tommy Thompson were added to the roster Thursday to beef up the Independents for the contest. Davenport added several ex-high school stars to help strengthen the backfield. The game started at 3 O‚Äôclock. Davenport took the opening kick and immediately moved the ball into Rock Island territory. Herb Sies lined up for a place kick but the kick tailed a bit to the left and the referees ruled the kick no good. Both teams moved up and down the field but Davenport never seriously threatened to score again. Late in the game Rock Island took the ball from their own 35 yard line and marched down to the Davenport 3 yard line. On first and goal Art Salzmann was held to no gain. Again Salzmann smashed into the line only to meet fierce resistance. On third down MacManus kept the ball himself after a mixup in the backfield and almost took the ball over goal. On 4th and one yard to g, the Independents lined up to go for the win. Salzmann took the ball and once again he was stuffed at the line. Fortunately for Rock Island, before the play started the Davenport official blew the play dead, offsides Rock Island. After the 5 yard penalty it was 4th and 6. The Independents lined up with a balanced line. Right end Behnamann was called to shift over to the left side of the line. It appeared Rock Island was going to run to the left. MacManus took the snap, ran back and gave a pump fake to the left. Quickly he turned and fired to Swanson who was no eligible and had released off the line to the right. Swanson reached out and hauled in the pass for the game winning score. Roy Salzmann missed the goal kick. Rock Island held Davenport again and took possession and held it until the final whistle. Herb Sies who played for St. Ambrose University was seen playing the game for Davenport at left half. Sies later went on to play for and coach the Rock Island Independents in 1923. Also starting in the game for Davenport was Waddy Kuehl, another St. Ambrose player. Kuehl played several years with the Rock Island Independents.http://www.rockislandindependents.com/NFL_scores/1912/1912week3box.htm  Game 4: vs. Kewanee Regulars  Kickoff was at 3 O‚Äôclock and the Regulars took the opening kickoff. After failing to make a first down they punted to the Independents. Rock Island had several runs up the middle and quickly scored a touchdown on a run by Robb. The game was never in doubt as Rock Island ran and threw the ball all over the field. The Independents were able to complete several passes on the day 2 of which went for touchdowns. Eight players scored touchdowns and Coleman was able to kick 4 extra points. The details are unclear as to how and when each player scored but it was clear that the Independents had no problems and were able to play all of their subs. Rock Island moved to 4‚Äì0 and will host the Moline West Ends next week since the Peoria Socials backed out of the game. The thought in Rock Island is that they fear they would not have a chance against the Independents.http://www.rockislandindependents.com/NFL_scores/1912/1912week4box.htm ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Rock Island Independents seasons Rock Island Rock Island ","title":"1912 Rock Island Independents season"},{"id":"35276260","text":"Katharina Rosenberger is a Swiss composer and sound artist currently living in the United States.

Photo League photographers Eagle, Sol Libsohn and David Robbins exhibited a series of photographs of slum districts in New York at the Federal Art Gallery in New York in 1938.

The group actively seeks to educate the general public about government and political history through displays at libraries and museums, as well as educating the public about reproduction items. ==History== The APIC was started by a group of like minded collectors in 1945. This group recognized that there should be a place for Numismatics, art collectors, and other hobbyists that sought politically themed items. APIC membership interests cut across every medium conceivable from buttons and posters to clothing and online media. ==Membership== Any individual may join the APIC by paying annual membership dues. Individuals that join the APIC can join with fellow collectors into various subgroups within the organization. These subgroups are called chapters, and are either \\"specialty chapters\\", that focus on a particular political figure like an American president, political candidate, political party or interest group. The other type of chapters are geographic chapters. Members of these chapters live in the same state or region and can either collect political items related to their region or not. Membership is also not limited to United States citizens. While the focus of the organization is primarily American, international membership is encouraged along with the study and preservation of non American political memorabilia. Museums and Libraries are eligible for the Museum Partnership Program. Members have the opportunity to attend regional APIC shows hosted by local chapters. There are many of these shows held throughout the country each year. ==GovernancePublications== The APIC publishes a magazine entitled The Keynoter four times a year. Current issues are available to dues paying members of the APIC. Any back issue may be purchased by non members for a fee. There is currently no online version of The Keynoter. An APIC monthly newsletter is sent to all members via The Political Bandwagon. ==Political activism== The Hobby Protection Act of 1973 ==National conventions== Every two years the APIC holds a national convention for collectors and the general public to gather. The conventions are a chance for the APIC Board of Directors to meet and discuss organizational business, hold seminars for collectors and the general public, exhibit member collections, tour historical sites, attend social gatherings, attend an auction, buy, sell, and trade items with other collectors.

After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1903 with a PhB, she went to Washington, D.C., to take up an appointment as assistant horticulturist and botanist in the Bureau of Plant Industry at the U.S. Department of Agriculture under Erwin Frink Smith, the USDA's pathologist-in- charge. Hasse was one of the twenty assistants that Smith hired during his tenure at the USDA. She later worked at the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station. Hasse died at her home in Muskegon, Michigan, aged 46.The Michigan Alumnus (1926), Volume 33, p. 284 == Research == Her paper \\"Pseudomonas citri, the cause of Citrus canker\\", published in the Journal of Agricultural Research in 1915, was the first to identify the cause of citrus canker. While originally it was believed that citrus canker was of fungoid origin, Hasse found that bacteria are at its source.PSEUDOMONAS CITRI, THE CAUSE OF CITRUS CANKER (archive.org book reader)PSEUDOMONAS CITRI, THE CAUSE OF CITRUS CANKER (archive.org text version), Clara Hasse, Journal of Agricultural Research, 2015-10, Volume 4, p. 97.

The antecedents of The Union date to an 1867 meeting to discuss the tuberculosis plague, and include the former Central Bureau for the Prevention of Tuberculosis and the International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT). The Union no longer uses the acronym \\"IUATLD\\" as its short-form name. ==History== Early pioneers were Robert Koch, Sir John Crofton and Karel Styblo. According to The Lancet, in the 70s, Styblo \\"harnessed the meager resources of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and showed that, contrary to expert opinion, tuberculosis could be controlled in extremely poor countries: beginning in Tanzania, one of the poorest of them all\\". In 1982, it instituted World Tuberculosis Day, commemorating 100 years from the date when Robert Koch discovered cause of tuberculosis. The expanded name and mission were adopted in 1986. The Union organises the annual Union World Conference on Lung Health, the largest annual meeting on lung health in the world.

They would lock the doors of the compartment from inside. When the train was completely on the bridge, the train would stop. The assailants would pick out the Hindus one by one, force them out of the compartment, slit their throats and throw their corpses into the river.

Granniss, Eleanor Cross Marquand, Henrietta C. Bartlett and Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt. It was named in honor of Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, a 10th-century German secular canoness, dramatist and poet. At the time of the Club's founding, women bibliophiles were not allowed membership in many premier bibliographic societies such as the Grolier Club, the oldest existing bibliophilic club in North America, or the Caxton Club. (This policy remained in place at both the Grolier and Caxton Clubs until 1976.) The first meeting of the Hroswitha Club was held on November 16, 1944, at the Cosmopolitan Club. It held regular meetings four to five times a year at multiple locations, and held its 200th meeting in 1994. Members of the Hroswitha Club included authors, bibliographers, librarians, curators, and private collectors. Individual members had a wide range of collecting interests - they collected books not just about Hroswitha, but also boxing, \\"military costumes,\\" and Walt Whitman; at least one member was a collector of incunabula. By the 1950s, membership had been reportedly capped at 40 members. Some notable members were Sarah Gildersleeve Fife, Anne Lyon Haight, Belle da Costa Greene, Frances Hooper, Ruth S. Granniss (librarian to the Grolier Club), Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt, and Shakespeare scholar Henrietta C. Bartlett. ==Activities== Members of the Hroswitha Club included authors, bibliographers, librarians, curators, and private collectors. They exchanged ideas, carried out research, and organized talks and visits to book collecting institutions both private and public. In 1948 Belle da Costa Greene, one of the few professional women then in the club, organized a visit to the Pierpont Morgan Library, giving group members access to the vault of rare materials. Additionally, the Club published several works throughout the 20th century, most notably a 1965 bibliography of Hroswitha almost a decade in the making; entitled Hroswitha of Gandersheim: Her Life, Times and Works, it was edited by Anne Lyon Haight with contributions from other Club members. Members carried out original research, establishing the dates that Hroswitha's dramas were performed. The Club also commissioned a life of Hroswitha, by Robert Herndon Fife (1947). The Club maintained its own private library, established in 1948 and later named the Sarah Gildersleeve Fife Memorial Library in honor of the club's founder; it specialized in books about Hroswitha, books published by members of the club, and other books of interest to collectors. The club's official bookplate was inspired by a copy of Albrecht D√ºrer's woodcut of Hroswitha that Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt acquired and donated to the club; she later had her friend Sarah B. Hill design the club's bookplate based on the woodcut. Records of the Club's correspondence and activities are found principally at the Grolier Club. Additionally, the Princeton University Library holds an address to the Club on the occasion of their visit by scholar and collector Miriam Y. Holden. ==Publications== * Barlow, Marjorie Dana.

The winner of the annual game is presented with the Saddle Trophy, which bears plaques marking the score of each meeting between the rival schools. The teams have met on the gridiron in 59 games since 1926. The game was first dubbed the \\"West Texas Championship\\", and the \\"Saddle Trophy\\" was first awarded, from 1961 through 1970. During this ten-year stretch, the schools split the series 5‚Äì5. The trophy was lost and the rivalry name disappeared until the moniker and trophy were reintroduced in 2017. ==History== From 1926 through 1955, TCU and Texas Tech frequently played as non-conference opponents. In 1956, Texas Tech joined the Southwest Conference (SWC), and the teams played annually as conference opponents, except in 1957 (as Texas Tech was not a full member of the SWC until 1960), until the conference's dissolution in 1995. After the dissolution of the SWC, the teams played a home-and-home series in 2004 and 2006 with the home team winning each time (Texas Tech in 2004, TCU in 2006). In 2012, TCU joined the Big 12 Conference and the teams renewed their annual rivalry. Texas Tech leads the overall series 32‚Äì26‚Äì3. TCU led the series 10-6 in the early years, 1926-1959. During Southwest Conference play in 1960-1995, Texas Tech led the series 21-12-3 (the series' 3 ties came in 3 straight games in Lubbock in 1979, 1981 and 1983). As members of different conferences during 1996-2011, the two teams met twice and split, 1-1. In Big 12 competition 2012-2018, Texas Tech holds a 4-3 lead. The series has featured many close games and some games with large margins of victory. Texas Tech holds the overall largest victory margin in the series with 56 points in a 63‚Äì7 win on November 9, 1985, in Lubbock. Tech's next largest victory margin was a 35-point margin in a 70-35 victory on September 18, 2004, also in Lubbock. TCU's largest victory margin was by 55 points in an 82‚Äì27 victory in Fort Worth on October 25, 2014. The 82 points scored was the most points ever scored against Texas Tech and the most points ever scored against any team in Big 12 history. The Frogs and Raiders have only met twice with both teams ranked in the top 25, in 2006 and 2012.

The seminary takes its name from Bishop Simon Brut√©, first bishop of the Diocese of Vinncennes, who came to Vincennes, Indiana from Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in 1834. Bishop Simon Brut√© Seminary has provided college-level seminary formation since 2004. Seminarians from 8 dioceses across the Midwestern United States reside at the seminary and take classes at Marian University. The founder and rector of the seminary from 2004-2016 was the Very Reverend Robert J. Robeson, PhD, a priest of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Reverend Joseph B. Moriarty was named Vice Rector in 2013 and Rector in 2016. In addition to his duties at the Seminary, Fr. Moriarty also assists with Spiritual Direction at St. Meinrad Semiary & School of Theology, as well as weekend ministry at Sts. Francis & Clare on the south side of Indianapolis. He also serves as chaplain to Marian University. The Reverend Thomas C. Widner, S.J., was appointed as first resident spiritual director in 2010. Reverend Jonathon Fassero, O.S.B. is also a spiritual director who ‚Äúresides‚Äù at St. Meinrad Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana. The seminary's motto, In hoc signo vinces was chosen because it was the episcopal motto of Bishop Simon Brut√©. The Latin translates to : \\"In this sign, you will conquer.\\" ==History== The seminary was established by Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlein, O.S.B. in August 2004 to prepare college seminarians for major seminary. Originally the seminary occupied part of the first floor of St. Francis Hall on the campus of Marian University, then Marian College. The seminary moved to its current location in 2008. The first Vice Rector was Paul Etienne who was appointed bishop of the Diocese of Cheyenne, Wyoming on October 19, 2009. The second Vice Rector was Reverend Patrick J. Beidelman, STL. He served in this position from 2009‚Äì2013 in addition to his duties as Director of Liturgy for the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In 2013 he was appointed by the Most Reverend Joseph Tobin C.S.s.R. (Archbishop of Indianapolis) as the Director for the Secretariat for Spiritual Life & Worship. The third Vice Rector (Rector as of June, 2016) was Reverend Joseph B. Moriarty. The fourth and current Vice Rector (as of June, 2016) is Father Justin Duvall, former Archabbot of St. Meinrad Archabbey. The first alumnus of Bishop Brut√© was ordained to the priesthood in the summer of 2012. The seminary logo features the initials of Bishop Simon Brut√©, \\"BSB\\". The diagonal cross located over the \\"S\\" is a reminder for priests and seminarians to embrace their daily \\"crosses\\" or sufferings, as disciples of Christ; it is also the sign (signo) of salvation referred to in the seminary motto. The \\"M\\" located within the crown above \\"BSB\\" stands for Mary, Queen of Heaven and Earth. The seminary was opened on the feast of The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, when it was placed under her patronage and protection. ==Campus== Located northwest of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, the seminary occupies . Upon moving to the new location, the seminary had a capacity of 38 seminarians with plans to expand in order to house as many as 60 by the fall of 2014. As of the start of the fall of 2013 the seminary has added on 10 new dorm rooms, and 2 priest apartments, this addition has expanded the occupancy to 60 men. As part of the Expansion project of 2012‚Äì13, the seminary added on a dining hall/ assembly room. The hall has been named the Archbishop Daniel Buechlein Dining Hall, after the Archbishop-Emeritus of Indianapolis. In the Fall of 2012, a renovation of the chapel was finished. The chapel had gone through many renovations in its history, this renovation bringing quite a difference! The chapel has hard wood ceilings and floors, which provide a suitable acoustic setting for the voices of the men praying or singing in common. The chapel renovations included the installation of an electric organ, expanded seating from around 30 to 72, an expanded sanctuary area, as well as a reredos. The reredos was custom designed for the seminary, to match the altar, which belonged to the late Bishop Chatard of Indianapolis. The building is distinctive for its combination of Medieval and Romanesque architecture. The building was built in 1932 for the Carmelite Sisters of Indianapolis, the building itself was acquired by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis in 2008. The community of Carmelite Sisters was dwindling and they moved out and sold the building to the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. They joined another community in Oldenburg, Indiana. The building has a unique history, starting with its founding by Mother Theresa Seelbach. Commonly called the \\"Castle on the Hill,\\" the building is known for being exactly that, a castle. Complete with turrets, arched windows and doors, as well as a \\"stony/rocky\\" exterior, the building is unusual to the area. Started as a house of prayer and residence for the community of the Carmelites of the Resurrection, now as a seminary the building has continued its long tradition of prayer. According to Archbishop Buechlein, Brut√© is first a House of Prayer, and all of the prayer and life of the seminary flows from the Mass and other liturgies. ==Mission statement== The Bishop Simon Brut√© College Seminary will work, in collaboration with Marian University, \\"to protect and develop the seeds of a priestly vocation, so that the students may more easily recognize it and be in a better position to respond to it\\" (Pastores dabo vobis, 63). The formation Program will provide the human, cultural, and spiritual formation, along with the academic formation grounded in the study of philosophy and theology, which will serve as a solid foundation for the major seminary (Pastores dabo vobis, 64). As such, the program will inspire seminarians to: *Cultivate a life of prayer centered upon the Eucharist. *Live and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ through their words and actions. *Honor Mary, the mother and model of the Church, and to live a life of virtue, love, and obedience based upon her example and guidance. *Develop an understanding of the teachings of the Catholic Church and a commitment to live according to these teachings. *Foster a deep respect for the human dignity of all people along with the human skills and sensitivity necessary for effective pastoral ministry. ==Represented dioceses== *Archdiocese of Indianapolis *Archdiocese of Cincinnati *Archdiocese of Louisville *Diocese of Gary *Diocese of Evansville *Diocese of Owensboro *Diocese of Springfield *Diocese of Knoxville *Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend ==References* Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis Category:Seminaries and theological colleges in Indiana Category:Universities and colleges in Indianapolis Category:Catholic Church in Indiana Category:2004 establishments in Indiana ","title":"Bishop Simon Brut√© College Seminary"},{"id":"35276666","text":"Neath Corporation Tramways operated a tramway service in Neath between 1897 and 1920.The Golden Age of Tramways.

Duncan was considered one of the strongest women in the Cincinnati geology department; her contributions to the Lipalian Research Foundation and the Pick and Hammer shows were additional work of her time. Duncan paved the path for many geology scholars to follow with her discoveries on fossil records and her studies in paleontology and stratigraphy. == Early life == In 1910, Duncan was born in Medford, Oregon, Duncan grew up near Virginia City, Montana. == Career == Duncan interest in geology piqued through Professor Charles F. Deiss. In 1934, she received her Bachelor's degree in Geology from the University of Montana and completed her master's degree in geology from the same institution in 1937. Her master's thesis, Trepostomata Bryozoa from the Traverse Group of Michigan, was published by the University of Michigan and is considered \\"a classic in its field\\". While she studied at the university, she held a librarian position as well as an instructor position. Helen attended the University of Cincinnati from 1939 to 1941 as a graduate student and was an assistant in the geology department. She switched to the applied science research division in 1942 as an assistant before joining the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to work on military projects. Duncan began with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as an editor in 1942 before becoming a geologist in 1945. While working with the USGS during World War II, she worked on a wartime fluorspar project under James Steele Williams. The United States was a major producer of fluorspar during World War II. Fluorspar/fluorite was classified as critical during World War II because a large percentage of United States consumption of this industrially important mineral was satisfied by imports.When the war was over, she began as a paleontologist. Her research spanned over a wide field and included identification of the late Paleozoic Bryozoa and other corals. This responsibility led her to analyze other algae, archaeocyathids, and hydrozoa. Duncan produced over 400 fossil records both during her work at the USGS and afterwards. In her career, Duncan gained a distinguished reputation for her work on fossil corals and Bryozoa. She was the first to identify Bighornia. This work was especially important because Bighornia is substantially different from those fossil horn corals found in the eastern United States. Much of her work identified and correlated fossil corals throughout the western United States and Canada that had never been previously identified. Through these efforts, her impact was large enough that her fossil descriptions can be used to identify index fossils for the Ordovician and Silurian geologic periods. Duncan‚Äôs work on Ordovician and Silurian Coral Faunas analyzed the distribution of the corals in western states of America including Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. This work also distinguished and illustrated many corals that had been overlooked or misidentified by previous American publications. Duncan‚Äôs publication pointed out and identified the distinctions between Ordovician and Silurian corals. Duncan‚Äôs extensive work distinguished the features and distribution of Early, Middle and Late Ordovician as well as Silurian corals. Her work also contains a section of detailed images of the corals found in Western Faunas. Duncan's work was extremely detailed and meticulous, and her descriptions continue to be used as example of thoroughness in modern paleontology classes. For example, paleontologist J. Thomas Dutro, Jr. credited Duncan for setting \\"a high standard\\", which influenced his own work. Together they determined through the works of Baltz and Read (Baltz and Read, 1960, p. 1766) about a possibility of an Early Mississippian age. In the Geologic Reconnaissance of the Mineral Deposits of Thailand, Helen Duncan supposes the age of the fossils found in limestone and siltstone known as Tentaculites, which is a genus of conical fossils. This fossil shared many of the same characteristics as the sandy shales where Silurian graptolites are also found. This fact alone gave Helen the idea that these Tentaculites shales came from the Silurian age, which dates 443 million years ago. In the early 1950s, she assisted collecting samples for George C. Hardin's Babb Fault System, Crittenden and Livingston Counties. From 1960 to the time of her death, Helen Duncan represented various committees around the world. In 1960, she attended the International Geological Congress in Copenhagen. In 1967, she attended the Sixth Carboniferous Congress in Sheffield, England on behalf of USGS. Helen served as a member on the Subcommission on Carboniferous Stratigraphy, the Geologic Names Committee, Paleontological Society, the Palaeontological Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society of Systematic Zoology, the Washington Academy of Sciences, and Sigma Xi. In Washington, she was also a part of the Paleontological Society and the Geological Society. Helen's field work in the Rockies and Great Basin eventually lead to her discovery of new index fossils. Besides her passion for science, Helen was interested in gourmet cooking. Her gourmet taste became famous within the scientific society. Visiting geologists of the time would not turn down an invitation to dine on her cooking. Guests usually went home satisfied with a meal they \\"wouldn't forget.\\" After years of suffering illness, Duncan died at home in Virginia City, Montana, on August 14, 1971. This was due to rheumatic heart disease, an illness that was first noticed in 1968, when she collapsed in a London airport. She continued to dedicate herself to her work on diagnostic fossils even during her illness. She passed away leaving important research on Ordovician corals and the possible origin of Alcyonaria investigation incomplete; however, will be remembered for her important work on palaeontology and most specifically late Paleozoic Bryozoa corals == Main contributions == Duncan's paleontological research and investigations contributed in a larger scale to the field of stratigraphy. Duncan's studies focused on the identification of Paleozoic bryozoa and the description and indepth exploration of Ordovician corals. Over 400 of her reports on fossils have been quoted by others in the scientific field, as her studies in paleontology and stratigraphy became resourceful to survey field geologists. This resulted in three coral specialists added to the staff due to the large amount of collections being sent in to be identified. Her many contributions granted her the Meritorious Service Award in 1971. == Awards and recognitions == * Member of Subcommission on Carboniferous Stratigraphy of the International Union of Geological Sciences (1960) * Ambassador for the U.S. Geological Survey at International Geological Congress (1960) * Member of the Paleontological Society (1964) * Member of the Paleontological Association (1965) * Member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1965) * Member of the Society of Systematic Zoology (1967) * Member of Sigma Xi (1967) * U.S Geological Survey representative at the Sixth Carboniferous Congress in Sheffield, England (1967) FLOWER, ROUSSEAU H., and JEAN M.

in Brewood parish church. Sir John Giffard (c. 1465-13 November 1556), of Chillington in Brewood, was a soldier, courtier, member of the English Parliament and Staffordshire landowner, who made his mark mainly during the reign of Henry VIII. ==Background and early life== Giffard was the eldest son of Robert Giffard of Chillington by his second wife, Cassandra Humphreston, daughter of Thomas Humphreston. The Giffard family had been settled at Chillington since the late 12th century.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.3. Little is known of his early life. He married Jane Horde, daughter of Bridgnorth's wealthiest landowner, in 1483, when he was about 17 years old. About the age of 20, in 1486, his father Robert died and he inherited the substantial Giffard estates, centred on Brewood. It is thought that Thomas Horde, his father-in-law might have advanced his career, perhaps introducing him at the royal court during the reign of Henry VII. Certainly he was well enough known there to be present in 1509 at Henry VII's funeral and at the coronation of his son, Henry VIII.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì Staffordshire (Author: N. M. Fuidge) From that date he held important posts in the royal household, gentleman usher and sewer of the chamber, and it seems likely that he held them even earlier. He had been made a Justice of the Peace in Staffordshire in 1501, a post he held until his death. ==Courtier== The embarkation of Henry VIII in 1520. Giffard accompanied him on this expedition, during which he met both the French king and the Emperor. From 1509 Giffard's career in royal service becomes known and notable. As well as the posts of gentleman usher and sewer, in which Henry VIII perhaps confirmed him, he was appointed Ranger of the Seven Hayes of Cannock Forest on 2 June 1509. A few months later, the title was altered to the less grandiloquent Ranger of Cannock Forest, and Giffard was to hold it until his death.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì GIFFARD, Sir John (Authors: L. M. Kirk / A. D.K. Hawkyard) On 25 September 1513 he was knighted at the battle of the Spurs in France. However, in 1515, Giffard, now a widower, offended the king by remarrying without his permission. He was able to repair relations, but only after paying a fine. Giffard was at court regularly for thirty years or more, and accompanied the royal family on many important state occasions. In 1520 he crossed the Channel again to attend the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Henry's meeting with Francis I of France, and was also at Gravelines two weeks later for the king's meeting with the queen's nephew, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He was a confidant of both the king and the queen, Catherine of Aragon, but his position seems not to have been damaged when they separated. He was present at the coronation of Anne Boleyn on 1 June 1533. Late in 1539, he and his son, Thomas were sent to Kent to prepare for the arrival of Anne of Cleves at Dover Castle and at Sittingbourne.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì GIFFARD, Thomas (Author: A. D.K. Hawkyard) Early in 1540 he also acted as whiffler, or horn- blower, when Anne was publicly received at Blackheath. ==Soldier== For all his attendance at court, Giffard was a serious soldier. In 1513, he distinguished himselfThe History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì LITTLETON, Edward (Authors: L. M. Kirk / A. D.K. Hawkyard) in Henry's invasion of northern France, in which English troops defeated the French at the Battle of the Spurs, going on to take the important stronghold of Tournai. He was allowed to carry the Royal Standard of England before the king during this campaign, on which he was accompanied by his friend and near neighbour Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall. It was after the taking of Tournai that he was knighted. Giffard was granted a standard in 1523 and may have served in southern France. At some time by 1533, he was made a knight of the body, a member of the royal body guard, a courtly and military honour. In 1536 he was sent to help fight the Pilgrimage of Grace, the rising in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire against the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act. ==Parliamentary career== Giffard's only definite period as a Member of the English Parliament was during the English Reformation Parliament, which lasted from 1529 until 1536. However, his name appears on subsidy commissions, the bodies charged with imposing taxation and made up mainly of MPs, between 1512 and 1524, so he may have held a seat outside Staffordshire before the known election. Giffard's election in 1529 was as a knight of the shire for his native county of Staffordshire. He was placed first in the order of precedence, above his friend and neighbour Littleton. In the first half of the 16th century, most member for the county sat for only one term, and Littleton's record in serving in five parliaments was unique. Members came from a small circle of landed gentry families: Giffard was reckoned a leading man in the county at the time of his election ‚Äì second only to the Earl of Shrewsbury. Giffard joined Queen's Head group ‚Äì a discussion meeting of MPs in the Queen's Head tavern. Another member of the group was Sir George Throckmorton, whose sister married Thomas Giffard. Throckmorton, Littleton and Sir John Giffard were all placed by Thomas Cromwell on a list believed to be of members opposed to the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals. This abolished the right of appeal to the Pope in both civil and ecclesiastical cases, and opposition to it was considered a touchstone of religious conservatism. However, Giffard attended the coronation of Ann Boleyn at the end of the 1533 session, and there is no hint that he opposed any of the more radical reforms that came later. Thomas Giffard and Littleton were soon involved in friendly competition for the monastic properties made available after the dissolution of 1536, while Sir John himself enquired after monastic lands at the Blackheath reception 1540. It is possible that Giffard was feeling some disquiet at the pace of change, however, and on 5 June 1533 he obtained a licence for himself and his wife to leave the country on a pilgrimage to Amiens, a shrine of John the Baptist, celebrated for his resistance to royal power. It is not known how long they stayed in France, but it seems likely that Giffard returned for further sessions of the Reformation Parliament. He certainly went off northward to defend its decisions by force of arms in 1536. There is no record of who Staffordshire returned to Parliament in 1536, but Henry VIII had forcefully requested that all existing members serve again, so it is likely that both he and Littleton were re-elected. He was now over seventy years of age and his son Thomas took over from him in the 1539 election. ==Landowner== Giffard's Cross and the Georgian entrance lodge at the Upper Avenue, Chillington. The cross is said to commemorate the shooting dead of an escaped and dangerous panther by Sir John Giffard. Giffard's main estate was Chillington, which had a small village, since disappeared, and a water mill, as well as the medieval moated and fortified manor house. Sir John carried out a complete reconstruction of the house on the same site. The new hall was a quadrangular building house with a gatehouse on its eastern side ‚Äì a plan similar to the roughly contemporary Pillaton Hall built by Edward Littleton. It was considered \\"remarkable for the various forms of its windows and chimneys.\\" As the same site was also used for the extant Georgian house, only fragments of Sir John's building remain, probably including carved panels incorporated into the present fireplace of the saloon, thought to occupy the site of the 16th century great hall. Allegedly Giffard kept a menagerie at Chillington, from which a panther escaped. The point at which he shot it with a crossbow is marked by Giffard's Cross, which is now in the garden of a small Georgian gate lodge. The original wooden cross, with its trefoil terminals to the arms, decayed and the present cross is a replica. In addition to Chillington, Giffard inherited the small estate of Walton, near Eccleshall. He began to extend his family's holdings locally. In 1495 he leased the estate of Hatton from the Bishop of Lichfield By the time of his death he also held a substantial part of Broom Hall as tenant of the bishop, although it seems that Sir John made a wedding present of his land at Broom Hall to Thomas Giffard in 1531. The estate was divided between the Giffards and the Lanes of Bentley. One of Sir John's tenants at Broom Hall was Thomas Careless. This partnership of the Lane, Giffard and Careless families was to prove crucial in the Escape of Charles II in 1651. In addition to these important local acquisitions, he also obtained from the king a number of lordships in Staffordshire, including Plardiwick, near Gnosall, Pattingham and Marston. As befitting an important landowner in the county, Giffard was pricked High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1509 ‚Äì part of a shower of honours that descended on him that year. However, he was also Sheriff a further five times: 1517‚Äì18, 1522‚Äì3, 1526‚Äì7, 1530‚Äì1, 1541‚Äì2. ==Marriages and family== Queen Mary, when Catholicism was temporarily restored. He is flanked by his wives, Jane and Elizabeth. Children on Sir John Giffard's tomb, most predeceasing him, as shown by the grave clothes. Sir John Giffard married twice. *Jane Horde or Hoord was his first wife. She was the daughter of Thomas Horde of Horde Park, just north of Bridgnorth, Shropshire. They married in 1483 and she died in childbirth on 8 December 1491, having borne 7 daughters and 2 sons, including Thomas Giffard, Sir John's heir, and Cassandra Giffard, who married Humphrey Swynnerton. Most of the children seem to have died at birth or while still young. *Elizabeth Montgomery, daughter of Sir Thomas Gresley of Colton, Staffordshire, was his second wife. The date of the marriage is uncertain but was by April 1515, when Giffard got into trouble with Henry VIII for marrying without permission. Elizabeth was the widow of Sir John Montgomery of Cubley, Derbyshire. She and Giffard had 4 sons and a daughter, Frances. Frances was the mother of John Talbot of Grafton, MP (d.1611). Giffard and his wives were interred in the parish church of St. Mary and St. Chad in Brewood. An impressive alabaster tomb was later installed, with part-gilded effigies of all three. ==References== Category:English MPs 1529‚Äì1536 Category:High Sheriffs of Staffordshire Category:16th-century English landowners Category:People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries Category:1460s births Category:1556 deaths Category:16th-century English soldiers ","title":"John Giffard (died 1556)"},{"id":"35276850","text":"Warren T.

Published by Taylor and Francis. ==History== The Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Tramway Company was incorporated by the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Tramways Order 1882, which authorised the construction of a link between the town of Pontypridd and the village of Treherbert in Glamorgan. The two termini are about apart, but the line as built only ran from Pontypridd for to the village of Porth. By October 1887, the company was experiencing financial difficulties, and they asked Solomon Andrews to complete the construction of the line, and then to run it for three years. Andrews was an entrepreneur from Cardiff, who had built a large commercial empire, which included coachbuilding and transportation. He began building buses in the 1870s, and in 1882 he obtained a patent for a horse bus that could run on tramway rails. He ran bus services in several British towns, and ran street tramways in Cardiff and Newport, as well as the Pontypridd tramway. The company had hoped to open the line on 2 November 1887, but Andrews did not agree to run the line early enough to meet this deadline, and it probably opened later in November, although the exact date has not been recorded. The line was single track, with the western terminus at The Square in Porth. It followed a course which is now the A4058 road towards Pontypridd, ending near the viaduct which carried the Taff Vale Railway's Rhondda line. This structure prevented the tramway, with its double deck cars, from continuing onwards to the town centre. After three years of operation, the company was still in financial difficulties, and was bought out by another company owned by Andrews, the South Wales Machinery & Carriage Company, in 1890. They ran it for another eight years, and then sold it to the British Electric Traction Company, who were building up a portfolio of tramways. Their policy was to seek local authority agreement to electrify and extend the lines they took over, but in this case they were unsuccessful. The services ran for another two years, but ended abruptly, probably in February 1902, when an outbreak of the infectious disease glanders resulted in most of the horses dying. The councils of Pontypridd and Rhondda were both hoping to build their own tramways, and Pontypridd obtained statutory powers to buy the line in August 1903. British Electric Traction received ¬£5,750 on 31 October 1904, and the two authorities each took over a section of the line, which they upgraded to run electric trams. Despite the fact that the two systems were linked at Trehafod, passengers had to change cars at that point, and it was not until 14 July 1919 that through running was again possible. This also required an adjustment to timekeeping, as both systems used local time, which differed by four minutes, but was resolved by both adopting Greenwich Mean Time. ==Closure== The local authorities in Pontypridd and Rhondda purchased the tramway in 1904 and divided it between them to operate Pontypridd Urban District Council Tramways and Rhondda Tramways Company. ==Bibliography== * * References Category:Tram transport in Wales Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Wales ","title":"Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Tramway"},{"id":"35276858","text":"Intershop Communications AG (founded in Germany 1992; Prime Standard: ISH2) is an independent provider of omnichannel commerce solutions.

At one point, a profit warning by Intershop caused widespread losses for other tech companies; for example, even SAP's stock fell by 8%. The company hardly survived the crash but was able to keep operating and to continue development of its products. In the process, about 30 spin-offs were founded, including Pixaco (later acquired by Hewlett-Packard), ePages and Demandware (later acquired by Salesforce.com).

The wind farm has a capacity of 400 MW (originally 700 MW was planned). The wind farm was commissioned in April 2018. ==Location== Located between from the shore, the wind farm is situated off the coast of the towns of Worthing and Shoreham-by-Sea to the west, the city of Brighton and Hove in the centre and the towns of Newhaven and Seaford in the east. The wind farm lies in a zone that is an irregular elongated area, approximately in an east to west direction and approximately in the north to south direction, an area of . ==Name== Flowers of the round-headed rampion, or Pride of Sussex, the county flower of Sussex Initially known as Zone 6 off the Sussex coast, it was later named the \\"Southern Array\\" (Hastings). When the site of the wind farm was changed from near Hastings to off Brighton, E.ON held a competition with local schools to suggest a new name as a public relations exercise. The name ‚ÄòRampion‚Äô was voted the winning suggestion, submitted by Davison C of E High School Pupil Megan McCullough, after the round-headed rampion (Phyteuma orbiculare), also known as the Pride of Sussex, the county flower of Sussex. ==Planning== E.ON's final plans use 116 turbines of approximately 3.45 MW capacity, each high to the tip of the blade, blade length is 55m, and radius is 12m which represents a 43% reduction in the size of the development after planning consent was granted. E.ON originally proposed using either 175 smaller turbines of 3-3.6 MW capacity, each above low tide sea level, or 100 larger turbines of 7 MW capacity, each above sea level. Development and construction costs were estimated at ¬£2 billion. As the turbines are designed to last approximately 20‚Äì25 years, and since E.ON's lease of the site from the Crown Estate is for 50 years, the company would eventually need to replace the turbines. After an 18 month evaluation process between Newhaven and Shoreham ports, E.ON chose Newhaven as their base for Operations and Maintenance facility. The company took a lease on a site at the Port of Newhaven, where they constructed two new buildings to house the administration and engineering functions of the wind farm. The site and associated buildings will act as the combined servicing point for the wind farm. The project was approved by the government in July 2014. In November 2014, E.ON announced that it had reduced the proposed capacity of the project by approximately 40%. Onshore construction work began in June 2015 with construction of a new electricity substation adjacent to the existing National Grid Bolney 400/132kV substation near Twineham. Off shore the 116 monopile foundations were piled into the sea bed and on completion of this the first wind turbine was lifted into place in March 2017. Coincident with this was the ongoing work to backfill the cable duct trenches off Lancing beach initially due to be completed in Spring 2017. Installation of the remainder of the 150kV cable through to Bolney and the burying in the sea bed of the 33kV inter array cables was also completed during this time following the installation of a 2,000 tonne offshore 33/150kV substation that was completed in April 2017.http://www.worthingherald.co.uk/news/2-000-tonne-substation-is-installed- at-rampion-wind-farm-1-7926039 An excavator was stranded and disabled after completing cable trench backfilling work in April 2017;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- sussex-39563255https://www.eonenergy.com/About-eon/our- company/generation/planning-for-the- future/wind/offshore/~/media/Content%20Editors/ECR/Rampion/Newsletters/1707%20Rampion%20Newsletter%20Summer%202017%20Final.pdf it was removed in June 2017.http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15382212.Moby_Dig____850_000_digger_stuck_in_the_sea_finally_removed/ Electricity production commenced during November 2017.

An Army Book in the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop wargame, is a rules supplement containing information concerning a particular army, environment, or worldwide campaign. Army Books for particular armies were introduced for the fourth edition of the game (prior to that all armies were included in the main rulebook). The sixth edition rendered these obsolete. Until superseded by newer versions, the 6th edition and later books remain valid for the newer editions of Warhammer. Games Workshop has also released various expansions over the years, including a siege rules supplement and campaign expansions. Expansions and Supplements may or may not be valid over multiple editions, though generally they cycle similarly to the Army Books. An Army Book normally contains: * Background - Information about the race and its place in the Warhammer world. This includes artwork, short stories, maps, timelines and copies of fictional documents. * Bestiary - A list of the units, characters and war machines that can be chosen for use in a battle. This includes their characteristic values, information on their weapon options, and any limitations on their use, as well as background information on each unit. An Army's special magic lore (if applicable) and special magic items are listed here. * Hobby section - Information on collecting, building and painting an army from the army book. This features outstanding example models painted by the Games Workshop 'Eavy Metal Team as well as Games Workshop's Army Painters and veteran hobbyists. * Army List - Each entry from the bestiary is arranged by type (Lord, Hero, Core, Special, Rare) and given a points value, with more powerful units costing more points, so that battles are fought between balanced armies.

The building, which was demolished in September 2013, had been designated a Grade II listed building in 1990. ==History== The first town hall in Wigan, located at the western side of the Market Place, was commissioned by the James Barry, 4th Earl of Barrymore and Sir Robert Bradshaigh, the town's representatives in parliament. It was designed in the Classical style with arcading on the ground floor to allow markets to be held and completed in 1720. The older building remained in use until its demolition in 1882. The building now referred to as the \\"old town hall\\" was the second of three seats of local government in Wigan; it was built on a plot at the corner of King Street and Rodney Street in Wigan, between 1866 and 1867. Designed by local architects Nuttall & Cook, the two-storey Italianate style structure was built largely of brick in Flemish bond, except for its sandstone ashlar ground floor and some sandstone dressings; the roof was of slate. It cost ¬£12,000 to build, the equivalent of about ¬£ in . The design included large round-headed windows with pilasters between them on the ground floor and square-headed sashed windows with architraves on the first floor; there was a cast-iron parapet above that decorated with urns on pedestals. The new building was originally used as the borough courts until civic leaders move their offices into the building in 1882. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the town hall on 20 May 1938 just before the start of the Second World War. In order to meet the expanding accommodation needs of County Borough of Wigan, some departments moved into a new civic centre which was opened by the Leader of the council, Alderman Ernest Ball, on 22 April 1970. The old town hall continued to be the headquarters of the council until the county borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. It then served as the headquarters of the Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council until 1990, when the council moved its staff to the new Town Hall, formerly the home of the Wigan Mining and Technical College. The old Town Hall subsequently remained vacant, and fell into a state of disrepair. Part of the rear of the building was demolished, leaving the remainder insecure. A planning application to redevelop the site as office accommodation and 133 residential units was submitted in 2007. After this proposal did not proceed, the building was completely demolished in September 2013. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Wigan ==References==  Notes  Citations Bibliography * * Category:Grade II listed buildings in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan Category:City and town halls in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1867 Category:1867 establishments in England Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2013 ","title":"Old Town Hall, Wigan"},{"id":"35277060","text":" The SAIMAN LB.2 was an unconventional Italian two seat cabin side by side sport aircraft designed around 1937, with a single pusher configuration engine, twin tail booms and an early tricycle undercarriage. ==Design and development== As well as its own designs like the SAIMAN 202 cabin monoplane, SAIMAN also constructed other peoples' aircraft. The LB.2 was one of the latter, designed by Francis Lombardi who was well known for his Avia FL.3 trainer aircraft. The unusually laid out LB.2 was largely of conventional wooden construction. It was a cantilever mid-wing monoplane, with a three section wing consisting of a centre section and two outer panels. The wing's wooden structure was plywood covered at the leading edge and fabric covered aft. Slotted flaps were fitted. Two parallel, rectangular section tail booms, mounted at the wing centre section-outer panel junctions, carried the empennage. Like the wings, the tail surfaces had wooden structures and were plywood and fabric covered. The tailplane and elevator was of constant chord and did not extend beyond the fins, which had swept, straight leading edges and carried curved rudders, cut away below. The central nacelle of the LB.2 placed the seating well ahead of the wing leading edge and the engine at the trailing edge. It was a flat sided structure of mixed construction, with plywood covering around the nose and cabin and metal around the engine. Seating was enclosed, with access via fuselage side doors. The flat cabin top continued behind the cabin to the engine housing, where an 82 kW (110 hp) Alfa-Romeo 110-I 4-cylinder inverted air-cooled in-line engine was mounted in pusher configuration. The LB.2 was one of the first Italian aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage. This was non-retractable, with the mainwheels on short vertical oleo legs wing mounted at the root of the tailbooms. The nosewheel was steerable. ==Operational history== The SAIMAN LB.2 appeared at the Milan show of 1937, though Flight dismissed it as a \\"freak\\". Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1938 described it as \\"now built under licence by SAIMAN\\" but it is not certain that more than the prototype was constructed. ==Specifications References== Category:1930s Italian sport aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Mid-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1937 ","title":"SAIMAN LB.2"},{"id":"35277092","text":"Mutant Mudds is a platform video game developed by Renegade Kid. The game was first released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012, and arrived on Microsoft Windows and iOS in 2012. An enhanced version of the game, titled Mutant Mudds Deluxe, was released in 2013 for Wii U and Microsoft Windows, and in 2016 for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. A Nintendo Switch version, titled Mutant Mudds Collection, which included Mutant Mudds Deluxe, Mutant Mudds Super Challenge (a game with the same engine as Mutant Mudds, but with harder levels containing more enemies etc.), and Mudd Blocks (a puzzle game with elements from Mutant Mudds), was released in December 2017. In 2016, Mutant Mudds Super Challenge was also released for Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. == Gameplay == The player uses the A or B button to jump once, and pressing that button again, while in mid-air, causes the character to hover for several seconds. The player can also shoot with either the X or Y buttons. Most enemies in the game must be shot several times to be killed. While standing on an orange launch pad, jumping will send you into the background, or foreground. The gameplay generally remains the same, as this is mainly to make use of the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. The PC version, due to the fact that 3D visuals aren't standard, uses a depth of field effect when it jumps between the background and foreground. The main levels in the game are put into one of four \\"worlds\\". The later worlds' levels are only unlockable by defeating a certain number of previous stages. Within each level, there are three objectives. The main and most straightforward‚Äîone is simply to get to the end of the stage and collect the Water Sprite. The second objective is to collect all of the golden diamonds for that level. In each one, there are exactly 100 golden diamonds scattered throughout the area. The third and usually most challenging objective is finding and completing the secret \\"land\\" hidden within each stage. There is a door labeled \\"CGA-land\\", \\"G-land\\" or \\"V-land\\" hidden somewhere in each area, and entering it transports Max to a short, but challenging, secret stage needed to fully complete the game. At the start of every level, Max is given unlimited ammunition and three hearts. The character will lose one heart every time he runs into an enemy or any obstacle meant to cause him harm. Some obstacles however, like spikes and lava, will instantly kill him. There is also a four-minute time limit (3DS version only) that will instantly end the player's game if the level is not completed within that time. By collecting enough golden diamonds, Max can unlock upgrades that he can equip one at a time: an extended jetpack for crossing larger gaps, a rocket jump for reaching high up areas and a bazooka for breaking through barriers. These must be used to access some of the G-Land and V-Land areas. The 20 bonus levels, included in the PC version of the game and as free downloadable content for the 3DS version, sees players taking control of Max's grandmother, Granny. She is able to use all of the upgrades simultaneously. == Plot == The game begins with a short cutscene. It shows two people, one of them, Max, the main protagonist, sitting in a small living room and playing a video game, until a large meteor suddenly hits. The scene fades to black, then shows a news station on TV reporting on a \\"Muddy\\" invasion, and equipped with only a water gun and a jetpack, Max goes to stop the Mutant Mudds not long after. Legend has it that the Water Sprites are able to erase any kind of dirt or mud, and that collecting them all will get rid of the Mutant Mudds for good. After that, the player is immediately thrust into the tutorial level, where one learns the controls. == Development and release == Mutant Mudds was developed and published by Renegade Kid, best known for its first-person shooters Moon and the Dementium series on the Nintendo DS. Mutant Mudds was first showcased at E3 2009 by the developer's co-founder Jools Watsham. The game was originally titled \\"Maximillian and the Rise of the Mutant Mudds\\" and was planned as a third-person shooter for release on the DS. According to Watsham, a team of four designers at Renegade Kid spent two weeks modifying the 3D graphical engine from Moon to create an early, polygonal incarnation of the game. However, the developer scrapped the idea when the game failed to attract publisher attention. In late 2010, Renegade posted a request to obtain the support of 1,000 fans to justify distributing the game on DSiWare via the Nintendo DSi. Again, Renegade Kid's plans fell through. Watsham suggested that the game was intended for Xbox Live Arcade at one point. Mutant Mudds was reintroduced just prior to E3 2011 in a reworked, 2D side-scrolling format for the 3DS. The game's design was meant to resemble games of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, promoted by Renegade Kid as a \\"12-bit\\" platformer. It was specifically inspired by a number of earlier platfomers including Super Mario World, Gargoyle's Quest, and Virtual Boy Wario Land. The last of these three games utilizes a 3D mechanic in which the player jumps between three different planes in the foreground and background, an effect Watsham attempted to build- upon for Mutant Mudds on the 3DS. Watsham explained that \\"only the essence\\" of the original, fully 3D version of the game was carried over for the side- scrolling version; he felt that 2D platforming offers more precise gameplay than those in 3D. Mutant Mudds was created by only three people: Watsham, Matthew Gambrell and Troupe Gammage. Watsham was the game's main artist and designer. Gambrell handled the game's programming, as he had experience with 2D platfomers. Gammage composed the game's 21-track musical score, which was made available on the developer's website with an open pricetag. Mutant Mudds was originally supposed to be released in December 2011, but was delayed due to Nintendo's approval process and the holidays. The game was officially launched on the North American version of the Nintendo eShop on January 26, 2012. Renegade Kid was greatly satisfied with the finished product and its reception, which Watsham attributed to the designers' full creative control over the game's development. \\"We were not only able to create what we wanted but also present it to the world how we wanted,\\" he elaborated. \\"How the game is presented to the world can be just as important as the quality of the game in terms of people‚Äôs opinions and expectations of a game.\\" Watsham stated that the developer opted out of including downloadable content (DLC) because it would have delayed the release. \\"It was important for us to have Mutant Mudds released as soon as possible on the eShop, while maintaining the same quality and scope we originally envisioned for the game,\\" Watsham explained. \\"I see the value in DLC, so I hope we can support it in the future somehow.\\" The game was made available for purchase in North America from the Nintendo eShop on January 26, 2012, and June 21, 2012 in Europe. A version for Microsoft Windows containing additional content was released on August 30, 2012. A demo of the game was released on the North American eShop on March 29, 2012, two months after the full game. The game later got a European release on June 21, 2012. 20 additional levels from the PC version were released for free on the Nintendo eShop on October 25, 2012. Renegade Kid also plans to release a sequel in the future. == Reception == Mutant Mudds has been well received by most critics, holding an average score of 82% on GameRankings and 80% on Metacritic with praise for its level design and gameplay. ==Mutant Mudds: Super Challenge== Mutant Mudds: Super Challenge is a spin-off and sequel to the original game. The story is similar, where Max goes investigate another meteorite crash and is set to retrieve 45 Water Sprites to stop the Mudds' invasion on Earth. Once done, Granny goes ibto a spaceship and set to the Mudds' planet to endit all for good. The game received mostly positive reviews with particular praise for its challenging gameplay and level design. The Wii U version has a score of 83/100 and the PS4 version has a score of 78/100 on Metacritic, both indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". == Sequel and legacy == A sequel to Mutant Mudds was announced in 2013. Max is also going to appear as a playable cameo character in the upcoming Wii U and PC game Hex Heroes. == References  External links == * *Mutant Mudds at Nintendo Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:2012 video games Category:Alien invasions in video games Category:Cancelled Nintendo DS games Category:Cancelled Xbox 360 games Category:IOS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Windows games ","title":"Mutant Mudds"},{"id":"35277096","text":"Gibraltar 1 is the specimen name of a Neanderthal skull, also known as the Gibraltar Skull found at Forbes' Quarry in Gibraltar and presented to the Gibraltar Scientific Society by its Secretary, Lieutenant Edmund Henry R√©n√© Flint on 3 March 1848. Its discovery predates that of the Neanderthal type specimen. ==In 19th century science== Found more than ten years before the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and eight years prior to the famous discovery in the Neander Valley, the significance of the find was not understood at the time, and the skull was simply labelled as \\"an ancient human, died before the universal flood\\" and lay forgotten inside a cupboard at the Garrison Library for many years. After the publication of Origin of Species, a renewed interest in the fossil human remains led to the skull being brought out of obscurity and presented at a meeting in the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1864. Darwin was not present, but the skull was later examined by both Darwin and Thomas Huxley, who concluded the skull was that of an extinct human species. Darwin did however only make fleeting reference to Gibraltar 1 in the 1871 Descent of Man.Darwin, R.C. 1871: The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex. London: John Murray. Volume 1., p. 28, 1st edition. A cast of the skull can be viewed at the Gibraltar Museum ‚Äì the original is on display in the Human Evolution gallery of the Natural History Museum in London. ==Age== Front view of the skull in the Natural History Museum, London The original find was done in a time where the palaeontological dating was still in its infancy, and no stratigraphic information was supplied with the skull, making dating at best guesswork. Another specimen from a different locale on Gibraltar (Gibraltar 2) has however been dated to between 30 thousand to 50 thousand years old. The skull is that of an adult woman, also with typical Neanderthal features. While the skull was one of the first to be found, it was also possibly from one of the last surviving Neanderthal populations. ==Gibraltar as a refuge== Side view of the Skull Until the late twentieth century, it was believed that the last Neanderthals disappeared about 35,000 years ago. However, studies have suggested that Neanderthals survived in southern Iberia and Gibraltar to less than 30,000 years before the present. Radiocarbon dating performed on charcoal in Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar in 2006 suggests that Neanderthals lived there 24,000 to 28,000 years ago, well after the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe 40,000 years ago. Vanguard Cave and Gorham's Cave are still the sites of active archaeological excavation in 2012. These caves may have represented the refugium of Gibraltar's Neanderthals. ==3D modelSee also== * Engis 2 * Gibraltar 2 * Neanderthal * Neanderthal 1 * List of fossil sites (with link directory) * List of human evolution fossils (with images) * History of Gibraltar ==References== Category:Prehistoric Gibraltar Category:1848 in Gibraltar Category:Neanderthal fossils Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Gibraltar 1"},{"id":"35277099","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County, Arkansas, United States.

Lastly, the company requested to be taxed on parts rather than built-up units.

H√©l√®ne Betty Louise Caroline de Rothschild was the daughter of Baron Salomon James de Rothschild and (n√©e Adele Hannah Charlotte de Rothschild) (the daughter of Salomon's German cousin Mayer Carl von Rothschild). She was raised at the H√¥tel Salomon de Rothschild at 11. rue Berryer in the 8th arrondissement in the heart of Paris, near the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. Her mother bequeathed the property to the French government fine arts administration rather than to her only child, because H√©l√®ne was disinherited for marrying a Roman Catholic. Relationships On 16 August 1887 H√©l√®ne married the Roman Catholic Baron Etienne van Zuylen (1860‚Äì1934) of the House of Van Zuylen van Nievelt. They had two sons. Her son Baron Egmont van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1890‚Äì1960) was a diplomat and businessman and the father of Parisian socialite Marie-H√©l√®ne de Rothschild (born Baroness Marie-H√©l√®ne Naila Stephanie Josina van Zuylen van Nyevelt). In 1901 Zuylen, a lesbian, met Ren√©e Vivien to whom she provided much-needed emotional support and stability. Zuylen's social position did not allow for a public relationship, but she and Vivien often traveled together and continued a discreet affair for a number of years. Vivien's letters to her confidant, the French journalist and Classical scholar Jean Charles-Brun, reveal that she considered herself married to the Baroness. She may have published poetry and prose in collaboration with Zuylen under the nom de plume Paule Riversdale. The true attribution of these works is uncertain, however; some scholars believe they were written solely by Vivien. Even certain books published under Zuylen's name may be, in fact, Vivien's work.

In 1937, the family moved to Greenwich Village and lived in a building that is now a historic landmark. David Roland is a graduate of Little Red School House and its high school Elizabeth Irwin, where he wrote the school song and captained the basketball team, and attended New York University, where he directed the senior film project. ==Career== His earliest film experience was a summer job as guide and messenger at RKO, where His godfather Dore Schary was the head of the studio. On leaving NYU, his first film job was with Shamus Culhane, an ex Disney animator, whose wife was Maxine Marx, the daughter of Chico Marx. In a freelance documentary career spanning four decades, Roland worked for all the major networks and garnered two Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award and a citation from the National Academy of Science. One Emmy was won for Comedian Backstage, an insight into the work of Shelley Berman. The second Emmy was for In The News, an innovative news program designed for young people. Roland won the Peabody Award for Call it Macaroni an experiential learning series that Roland conceived. The program involved filming young people in various situations which included, Dancing with Alvin Ailey, Spring Training with the Philadelphia Phillies, Living with the Circus, Swimming with Dolphins and Jazz in New Orleans. He did a film for NBC on changes which occurred in the Soviet Union as a result of Nikita Khrushchev coming to power. Another film that was constructed by Roland was on a play called The Dragon, which helps people to understand every aspect of what is like to be a part for the theater. Fire Rescue was another one of his projects and showed what it is like to be working in this section of the fire department. Roland is proud to use the technique of Cinema Verite in all of his films. Roland was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1995 to 2002 and served as Chair from 2000 to 2002.http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody- awards-board-members Roland produced and directed films for the American Mathematics Society on two outstanding mathematicians: Marsden Morse and Richard Courant. For Time/ Life he made Dam Builders, comparing the ecological impact of humans and beavers. For PBS, he constructed a film examining various aspects of psychiatric treatment. Roland also produced and directed a film on the Gate Theory of Pain. Roland fulfilled a long time ambition when he was elected Business Agent of the Editor‚Äôs Union, Local 771 Editor‚Äôs Union, Local 771, IATSE. In 1968, David headed the Queens Ninth Congressional District campaign for Peace Candidate Eugene McCarthy and won 3 convention delegate seats out of six in a conservative district. Political activities Roland also worked as Legislative Assistant to New Jersey State Senator, Byron Baer, dealing with constituent problems. He also volunteered with the Bergen County Probation Department and Food Action. Roland continues to lead film seminars at colleges and high schools, libraries, and for community organizations to enhance appreciation of the various aspects of film as art. Other projects To raise funds for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), Roland proposed a benefit program featuring Pete Seeger, Patti Smith and Guy Davis. He produced the entertainment section of the standing-room-only benefit at the Museum of the City of New York. Currently, he is working to establish an Archive of Songs of Social Significance at SUNY Purchase and is producing a concert to inaugurate the project. Another film in progress is a documentary called 'Why Art?' Is it a Biological Necessity?, which has the support of Ian Tattersal of the American Museum of Natural History and Paleontologist Richard Leakey. The film will examine homo sapiens' apparent intrinsic need to create art. Another project is a film about the Development and Meaning of Comedy and how it was used beginning with the Greeks, covering Shakespeare, and including modern times. David was the Creative Consultant on a film about anti-semitism in Poland and was awarded the accolade 'il miglor fabbro' (the better craftsman) by the film‚Äôs producer. He is married to writer Leah Margulies Roland. They have 3 children; Samuel Roland, a writer and musician, Abigail Roland, a musician, and Jessica Roland, a bookbinder.

It started publishing its first journal in 2008. By 2015, it claimed over 700 journals, although about half of them were defunct. Its subsidiaries include iMedPub LTD and Conference Series LLC LTD. Other organisations linked to OMICS are EuroSciCon Ltd, Allied Academies, Trade Science Inc, and Meetings International. OMICS has come under attack by numerous academics and the United States government over the validity of the peer review by OMICS journals, the appropriateness of its fees and marketing, and the apparent advertising of the names of scientists as journal editors or conference speakers without their knowledge or permission. The U.S. National Institutes of Health sent a cease-and-desist letter to OMICS in 2013, demanding it to discontinue with false claims of affiliation with U.S. government entities or employees. In August 2016 OMICS became the first academic publisher to be sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for deceptive practices; nearly three years later, the FTC was awarded a summary judgement of over US$50 million. OMICS has responded to criticisms by avowing a commitment to open access publishing, claiming that detractors are traditional subscription-based publishers who feel threatened by their open access publishing model. It responded to the FTC suit by maintaining that their practices were legal and claiming that corporate interests were driving the suit. It has also threatened a prominent critic, Jeffrey Beall, with a $1 billion lawsuit for defamation. ==History== OMICS Publishing Group was founded in 2007 by Srinubabu Gedela, who remains the company's director. He founded OMICS because of his difficulty in accessing high-cost journal contents as a PhD student. It started its first open-access journal, the Journal of Proteomics & Bioinformatics, in 2008. In 2012, OMICS Group had more than 200 journal titles, about 60% of which had no content. By 2015, it claimed over 700 titles, but about half of them were defunct. Several OMICS journals have names similar to existing publications. For instance, BioMed Central established the Journal of Biomedical Science in 1994, while OMICS established the Journal of Biomedical Science _s_ in 2012. OMICS employed around 2,000 people, about two thirds of whom are female. In 2016, the company had revenue of $11.6 million and generated a profit of about $1.2 million. The Government of India has waived taxes whilst granting subsidized land for the construction of new headquarters. ==Publishing activities== OMICS operates on a gold open access model, wherein the author pays for publication and the publisher makes the articles available for free. As well as publication fees, OMICS charges a withdrawal fee for manuscripts that are withdrawn five or more days after submission. Such withdrawal fees are not levied by non-predatory publishers, and have been criticized as unethical and as discouraging researchers from making post-submission corrections to their work. In addition to publishing journals, OMICS also organizes conferences. In 2017, about 3,000 such conferences were organized. The conference arm makes up about 60% of OMICS' revenue. ==Criticism of publishing practices== OMICS is widely regarded as a predatory publisher. It has been subject to widespread criticism, notably by Jeffrey Beall, who included OMICS in his list of \\"potential, possible, or probable predatory\\" publishers. Among the criticism leveled at OMICS are that its journals are not actually peer-reviewed as advertised, often contain mistakes, and that its fees are excessive. OMICS says that its activities are legitimate and ethical, and that the quality of its editorial control does need improvement. Other criticisms of OMICS include the publication of pseudoscientific articles, deceptive marketing practices, targeting of young investigators or those in lower income regions, and holding papers hostage by disallowing their withdrawal (preventing them from being published by other journals). It has also been suggested that OMICS provides fake lists of scientists as journal editors to create an impression of scientific legitimacy, even though they are not involved in any review or editing process. One such editor-in-chief was contacted by Science, and he stated that he had never handled any papers; in an interview with The Hindu, another said he had not been informed of his purported editorship. Other academics have said that OMICS published articles unaltered in spite of their request for revisions. The company has also been slow to remove the names of editorial board members who requested to terminate their relationship with OMICS activities, in some cases taking almost two years. One author received an invoice for $2,700 after her paper was accepted; this fee was not mentioned in the email message OMICS sent her to solicit a submission. In 2012, while one OMICS journal rejected a paper after the reviewer noticed it was plagiarized from one of his own co-authored papers, another OMICS journal published the same paper later that year. When the reviewer again pointed this out, the paper was removed from OMICS' website in 2014, but no official retraction was posted. In 2013, an OMICS journal accepted a bogus and obviously flawed publication submitted as part of a sting operation by Science. Critics assert that the main purpose of the publisher is commercial rather than academic. In September 2014, PubMed Central blacklisted OMICS journals, claiming serious concerns over OMICS' publishing practices. In 2017, Scopus delisted several OMICS journals for \\"publication concerns\\". A Bloomberg News investigation in 2017 noted a tendency of pharmaceutical companies to publish in these journals, which might have stemmed from a self-interest in skipping rigorous review procedures. They were also the major sponsors of OMICS conferences. OMICS Conferences In 2013, Jeffrey Beall reported that OMICS has added conducting \\"predatory meetings\\" to its publications activity including under the ConferenceSeries banner. Beall criticised the financial arrangements for OMICS conferences and urged all scholars to refrain from any dealing with these conferences. An example of such a meeting is the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics, organised by ConferenceSeries, and to which Christoph Bartneck, an Associate Professor in Information Technology at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, was invited. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, Bartneck used iOS's autocomplete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence, and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to Siri and Apple). A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: \\"The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids,\\" and the 516-word abstract contained the words \\"good\\" and \\"great\\" a combined total of 28 times. Despite being obvious nonsense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of $1099 requested. Bartneck commented that he was \\"reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science,\\" a comment he based on the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance. Gedela said that Bartneck's paper \\"slipped through\\" for being submitted \\"so close to the deadline\\". In another example, Tom Spears of the Ottawa Citizen repeatedly submitted to OMICS conferences several sting abstracts that included \\"Evolution of flight characteristics in avian-porcine physiology\\" and \\"Strategies for remediation of benthic and pelagic species dependent on coral reefs: Cases of T. migratorius and G. californianus\\" which respectively claimed to explain how pigs fly and claimed roadrunner birds lived underwater. In yet another case, OMICS accepted a paper plagiarized from Aristotle and \\"garbled to remove any clear meaning\\" to an ethics journal, and later accepted the same paper to a conference on geriatrics and nursing. It has been also found that many academic or government scientists are advertised as speakers or organizers for OMICS conferences, without their agreement. Action by US government agencies In April 2013, OMICS received a cease- and-desist letter from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) after a complaint filed by Ken Witwer, who said he had been fooled by OMICS's deceptive marketing. The letter alleged that OMICS used images and names of employees that either no longer worked at NIH or did not provide permission, and asked OMICS not to use the name of its agencies institutes or employees for anything other than \\"true factual statements\\". OMICS responded by modifying its website and providing emails and letters from the NIH employees ostensibly agreeing to serve as editors of OMICS journals. Those employees later said that while they did agree to serve as editors, they did not provide permission for their names to be used in marketing materials; furthermore, they had not actually handled any manuscripts.  FTC suit  In August 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a suit against OMICS, two of its affiliated companies and Gedela, charging them with deceptive publishing practices and seeking an unspecified monetary reimbursement for academics, duped by them. In its first-ever suit against an academic publisher, they alleged OMICS' peer-review processes to be a \\"sham\\" and their claiming of renowned academics in their editorial board and/or as speakers at its conferences without their consent to be intentionally deceptive. The FTC also noted a failure to disclose publishing fees prior to accepting pieces, citing of dubious impact factors and false assertions about their journals being indexed in PubMed, when they are not. In response to the lawsuit, OMICS rejected the various allegations, maintaining that their processes were legal and claiming that corporate interests were driving the suit. The United States District Court for the District of Nevada handed down a preliminary injunction in November 2017, preventing OMICS from \\"making misrepresentations\\" about their journals and conferences, as well as requiring that OMICS clearly disclose all article processing charges. The FTC won a summary judgment (ECF No. 86) on 29 March 2019, with the court finding that OMICS made false claims about manuscripts being peer-reviewed, used the name of prominent researchers as editors of journals without their consent or knowledge, used misleading impact factors for journals which had not been calculated by Clarivate Analytics, made false claims about being indexed by PubMed, and wasn't transparent about the publication fees charged per manuscript until after it had accepted an article for publication, and often didn't allow researchers to withdraw their articles after submission. OMICS was ordered to pay a fine of $50,130,810 as well as change some of its publishing methods. OMICS plans to challenge the ruling. Legal threat to Jeffrey Beall In 2013, OMICS Publishing Group sent a letter to then University of Colorado librarian Jeffrey Beall stating that they intended to sue him and were seeking $1 billion in damages. In their six-page letter, OMICS stated that Beall's blog is \\"ridiculous, baseless, impertinent,\\" and \\"smacks of literal unprofessionalism and arrogance\\". Beall said that he found the letter \\"to be poorly written and personally threatening,\\" and that he thought: \\"the letter is an attempt to detract from the enormity of OMICS's editorial practices\\". OMICS' law firm said it was pursuing damages under India's Information Technology Act, 2000, referring to section 66A, which makes it illegal to use a computer to publish \\"any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character\\" or to publish false information. It stated that three years in prison was a possible penalty, although a U.S. lawyer said that the threats seemed to be a \\"publicity stunt\\" that were meant to \\"intimidate\\". An editorial in the New Delhi-based India Today cited the incident as evidence that Section 66A should be discarded to eliminate its use in \\"stifling political dissent, crushing speech and ... enabling bullying\\".

Acquisition of Canadian publishers  In late September 2016, OMICS acquired two Canadian publishers‚ÄîAndrew John Publishing and Pulsus Group‚Äîand sixteen journals published by them.

The story was adapted for the screen by A.I. Bezzerides and Robert Rossen, based on the racy novel Desert Town by Ramona Stewart. The picture was produced by Hal Wallis, with music by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa and cinematography in Technicolor by Charles Lang. ==Plot== Fritzi Haller (Mary Astor) is the powerful owner of Purple Sage, a saloon and casino in the small fictional mining town of Chuckawalla, Nevada. Her daughter, Paula Haller (Lizabeth Scott), has just quit school and returned home at the same time that gangster Eddie Bendix (John Hodiak) has returned. He was once involved with Fritzi, but left town under suspicion of murdering his wife. Paula does not have a good relationship with her mother Fritzi and when she sees how unpleasant Eddie is for her, she begins a relationship with the crook. Paula's old boyfriend, and local lawman, Tom Hanson (Burt Lancaster), along with Bendix's sidekick, Johnny Ryan (Wendell Corey), try to break up the relationship. When Fritzi finds out, she angrily tries to protect Paula and put a stop to her seeing Bendix. But the resolute Paula does not give up easily until she knows the past of her beloved Eddie. Bendix's past catches up with him in an unexpected way when the car he is in, running from Hanson (who wants to rid the town of the likes of Bendix and Ryan), crashes through the railing as it is going onto the bridge and plunges down the embankment, killing him. ==Cast== * Lizabeth Scott as Paula Haller * John Hodiak as Eddie Bendix * Burt Lancaster as Tom Hanson * Mary Astor as Fritzi Haller * Wendell Corey as Johnny Ryan * Kristine Miller as Claire Lindquist * William Harrigan as Judge Berle Lindquist * James Flavin as Sheriff Pat Johnson * Jane Novak as Mrs. Lindquist * Anna Camargo as Rosa ==Production== Scenes were shot on location in the small Ventura County, California, town of Piru, with the northwest side of Center Street, at Main, used as the exterior of Fritzi's saloon and casino; the Piru Mansion was used as the Haller home and the historic Piru bridge was used as the locale of the car crash. Some scenes were also shot in Clarkdale, Arizona.

They wrote, \\"Desert Fury is a beaut - a beaut of a Technicolored mistake from beginning to end. If this costly Western in modern dress had been made by a lesser producer than Hal Wallis it could be dismissed in a sentence. But Mr. Wallis is a man with a considerable reputation, being a two-time winner of the Irving Thalberg Award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Desert Fury is such an incredibly bad picture in all respects save one, and that is photographically.\\"The New York Times. \\"Movie Review Desert Fury (1947)\\" film review, September 25, 1947. Last accessed: April 16, 2014. In later years the film has been praised as a seminal and unique Hollywood melodrama due to its bold overtones of homosexuality: Film scholar Foster Hirsch wrote, \\"In a truly subversive move the film jettisons the characters' criminal activities to concentrate on two homosexual couples: the mannish mother who treats her daughter like a lover, and the gangster and his devoted possessive sidekick. (...) Desert Fury is shot in the lurid, over-saturated colors that would come to define the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk.\\"Foster Hirsch: The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir, Da Capo Press, New York 2008, ; p.224. Film noir expert Eddie Muller wrote, \\"Desert Fury is the gayest movie ever produced in Hollywood's golden era. The film is saturated - with incredibly lush color, fast and furious dialogue dripping with innuendo, double entendres, dark secrets, outraged face-slappings, overwrought Miklos Rosza violins. How has this film escaped revival or cult status? It's Hollywood at its most gloriously berserk.\\"Eddie Muller: Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir, St. Martin's, New York 1998, , p. 183. In one notable piece of dialogue for the period, Paula asks Eddie how he and Johnny met. He replies: \\"It was in the automat off Times Square, about two o'clock in the morning on a Saturday. I was broke, he had a couple of dollars, we got to talking. He ended up paying for my ham and eggs.\\"\\"And then?\\", Paula asks. To which the reply is: \\"I went home with him that night. We were together from then on.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 7 critics, with an average rating of 5.5/10.

Its routing travels through portions of McDuffie, Columbia, and Richmond counties. The highway connects Thomson with Grovetown, Augusta, and Fort Gordon. Except for the portions in Thomson, Grovetown, and Augusta, the highway is relatively rural. ==Route description== SR 223 begins at an intersection with SR 17 (Main Street) in Thomson, in central McDuffie County. Here, SR 223 is known as White Oak Street. At the intersection with Holt Street, it curves to the east-southeast and becomes known as White Oak Road. After that, it curves to the east-northeast. On the eastern edge of the city, the highway travels between Thomson High School and Thomson‚ÄìMcDuffie Middle School. Just after leaving the city limits, it has an intersection with US 78/SR 10/SR 17 Byp. (Thomson Bypass). The highway curves to the northeast and enters Columbia County. SR 388 in Grovetown, where both highways meet the eastern terminus of Harlem-Grovetown Road. SR 223, just northwest of its eastern terminus in Augusta, looking northwest toward Grovetown (note the discrepancy in signage, \\"north\\" vs. \\"west\\") Almost immediately, SR 223 curves back to the east-southeast at a point just southeast of White Oak Campground. At the intersection with Hinton Wilson Road, SR 223 becomes known as Wrightsboro Road. Farther to the east, Wrightsboro Road is an important urban corridor in the Augusta metropolitan area. The highway crosses over Kiokee Creek and has a slight northward jog before continuing to the southeast. Approximately later, it intersects US 221/SR 47 (Appling‚ÄìHarlem Road) at a roundabout. The road then curves to a more east-southeasterly routing and crosses over Little Kiokee Creek. Then, it travels just south of Euchee Creek Elementary School and Euchee Creek Library. A short distance later, the roadway crosses over the northern terminus of the Grovetown Trails at Euchee Creek, briefly skirting along the northwestern city limits of Grovetown in the process. A few hundred feet later, the highway enters Grovetown proper and has an intersection with the eastern terminus of Harlem‚ÄìGrovetown Road. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of SR 388, which takes on the \\"Wrightsboro Road\\" name, while SR 223 continues as West Robinson Avenue. The highway travels to the southeast. Just before intersecting the northern terminus of Newmantown Road, it curves to the east- southeast. Upon crossing some railroad tracks of CSX, it becomes East Robinson Avenue. Between the southern terminus of 2nd Avenue and the northern terminus of Hollingsworth Drive, it passes the city's fire and police department. It then curves to the south-southeast. At an intersection with the western terminus of Selkirk Way, SR 223 curves back to the southeast. Just past an intersection with the southern terminus of Pepper Hill Drive, the highway leaves the city limits of Grovetown and enters Richmond County and the city limits of Augusta. Immediately, SR 223 meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 78/US 278/SR 10 (Gordon Highway). The roadway continues to Fort Gordon's Gate 2. Just like nearby SR 383, this highway serves as an important access route from the Army base to the local area. The only segment of SR 223 that is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense, is from just west of the SR 388 intersection in Grovetown to its eastern terminus in Augusta. ==History== SR 223 was established in 1943, but on a path from SR 12 (which currently also carries US 278) in Norwood northeast to SR 80 in Cadley. Between November 1946 and February 1948, a separate segment of SR 223 was built from SR 80 in Cedar Rock to SR 12 in Thomson; however, there was no indication if it was concurrent with SR 80 between Cadley and Cedar Rock. This segment of SR 223 began just west of the Warren‚ÄìMcDuffie county line. It was known as Norwood Road at the western terminus of this segment. It traveled to the north-northeast and very quickly changed to Cedar Rock Road. The highway curved to the east-southeast and crossed over Childers Creek. At its intersection with Sallywhite Road, it began to curve to the east-northeast. The highway then curved to the southeast. It crossed over, but did not have an interchange with, Interstate 20 (I-20; Carl Sanders Highway). Approximately later, SR 223 curved back to the east-northeast, but quickly curved to the east-southeast. Just after crossing over Mattox Creek, it curved to the south-southeast, and entered Thomson. At the city limits, the highway was known as Hickory Hill Drive and passed by Hickory Hill, a historic house museum, which is a National Historic Landmark, it was a home of Georgia Populist Party co-founder Thomas E. Watson. and At the intersection with Lee and Lumpkin Streets, SR 223 was known as Tom Watson Way (named for Watson). It intersected SR 17 (Main Street) and the western terminus of SR 150 (Gordon Street). SR 17/SR 223 traveled concurrently to the south-southeast for about four blocks, where SR 223 split off to the northeast on White Oak Street, as it currently travels. Between June 1954 and June 1955, a road that would eventually become a further eastern segment was built from US 78/US 278/SR 10/SR 12 in Thomson to another intersection with those highways west-southwest of Augusta. At this time, all three highways were paved. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the segment from Thomson and what is now western Augusta was designated as part of SR 223; however, there was no indication if it was concurrent with US 78/US 278/SR 10/SR 12 in Thomson. Between 1972 and 1974, the eastern terminus of the central segment in Thomson was shifted northward to directly connect with the western terminus of SR 150. At least between 1973 and 1980, SR 223 was indicated to be concurrent with SR 80 between Cadley and Cedar Rock. In 1981, the Norwood‚ÄìCedar Rock portion of the highway was decommissioned. Between 2011 and 2013, the segment of the highway from Cedar Rock to Thomson was decommissioned. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==ReferencesGeorgia Roads (Routes 221 - 240) 223 Category:Transportation in McDuffie County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Columbia County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Richmond County, Georgia State Route 223 Category:Transportation in Augusta, Georgia ","title":"Georgia State Route 223"},{"id":"35277278","text":"United States v. Brechner, 99 F.3d 96 (2d Cir. 1996), is a Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision holding that a defendant's failure to provide entirely truthful information pursuant to a plea agreement is a legitimate basis for prosecutors to revoke a promise to move for a downward departure at sentencing. ==Background== Milton Brechner was president of a company that manufactured stuffed toy animals for sale to carnivals. The government determined that he used this company to engage in extensive tax fraud schemes, by both failing to report income from customers and, it was later determined, by receiving kickbacks from suppliers in return for paying inflated invoices. In January 1992, Brechner agreed to plead guilty to four counts of income tax evasion in exchange for prosecutors agreeing not to charge Brechner's company or his family for their involvement in the schemes. In May 1992, Brechner contacted the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the investigation and offered to provide information about a corrupt bank officer Brechner had bribed. In exchange, Brechner asked for a downward departure on his sentence. A written agreement was executed, in which Brechner agreed to give \\"truthful, complete, and accurate information\\" and the U.S. Attorney agreed to move for a downward sentencing departure under ¬ß 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.Brechner, 99 F.3d at 98 However, the agreement cautioned that \\"Should it be judged by the [U.S Attorney's] Office that the defendant has failed to cooperate fully, has intentionally given false, misleading, or incomplete information or testimony‚Ä¶ or has otherwise violated any provision of this agreement, the defendant will not be released from his plea of guilty but this Office will be released from its obligation under this agreement ‚Ä¶ [to file the ¬ß 5K1.1 motion].\\" Brechner participated in the government's bribery investigation of the bank officer for over a year. The bank officer was arrested in September 1993. At a debriefing session following the arrest, Brechner was questioned by the Assistant U.S. Attorney about receiving kickbacks from suppliers. Brechner initially denied receiving any such payments, but after the session was stopped by his lawyer and the two of them conferred, Brechner admitted to the kickbacks. After the debriefing, the Assistant indicated that he was not inclined to move for a downward departure due to Brechner's deception. At sentencing, the government declined to move for a downward departure. Brechner moved to compel the ¬ß 5K1.1 motion. At a hearing on that motion, the district court judge found that Brechner had \\"cooperated fully and completely\\" and that his \\"substantial assistance\\" warranted a ¬ß5K1.1 motion. The government appealed. ==Decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals== The appellate court focused on the explicit terms of the written agreement, which required that Brechner \\"provide truthful, complete, and accurate information\\" and that the government would be released from its obligation to file a ¬ß5K1.1 motion if Brechner had \\"intentionally given false, misleading, or incomplete information.\\" The court stated \\"By falsely denying his receipt of kickbacks from [the suppliers], Brechner breached his obligations under the agreement. According to the terms of the agreement, the government was expressly entitled to withhold the letter in those circumstances.\\" The court disagreed with the district court's finding that the breach was not material and Brechner's lies were merely \\"trivial defects.\\" To the contrary, the Court of Appeals found that \\"these lies, although swiftly corrected, seriously undermined Brechner's credibility as a potential government witness‚Ä¶ By lying to the prosecutor during the period of his cooperation about his own criminal involvement, Brechner made it impossible for the government to argue at any future trial that, despite his past sins, Brechner had acknowledged his guilt, turned over a new leaf and cooperated in a truthful and trustworthy manner.\\" Since the Supreme Court's decision in Giglio v. United States. required that defendants have access to information relating to a government witness's credibility and the potential for harsh cross-examination created a serious problem for the government, the court found that Brechner's lies \\"provided good faith grounds for refusing to move for a downward departure.\\" ==References * Category:1996 in United States case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cases Category:Pleas ","title":"United States v.

Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180 (1921), was a United States Supreme Court case that helped define the range and scope of federal question jurisdiction in state corporate law matters.. The case dealt with whether or not a district court had the power to uphold the constitutional validity of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. ==Background== Charles E. Smith, a shareholder of Kansas City Title & Trust Company, challenged the company's investment in farm loan bonds. The plaintiff (Smith) sued by filing an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The suit was filed to prevent the state bank from buying the federal bonds, claiming that the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, the law in which the transaction was based on, was unconstitutional. Kansas City Title & Trust Co. was authorized to invest funds in legal securities only. The plaintiff was against investing money into federal land bonds ($10,000 into bonds of the federal land banks and $10,000 into bonds of the joint-stock land banks) because he alleged that the Congress's undertaking to organize new banks, based on the Federal Farm Loan Act, was unconstitutional. The Western District Court of Missouri ruled that the Federal Farm Loan act was constitutional, making it so the Kansas City Title & Trust Co. could invest in farm loan bonds. The plaintiff wanted further relief on the matter, so the case went to the Supreme Court. Before stating the holding, it is important to explain what the Federal Farm Loan Act was, what federal-question jurisdiction is, and how they pertain to this case. The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 into law. The Federal Farm Loan Act was instated to increase credit to rural farmers to help small farmers compete with large corporate farms. After the Act was passed, farmers could borrow up to 50% of the value of their land. Mortgage-backed bonds were issued. \\"The rate of interest on the mortgages could be no more than 1 percent higher than the rate of interest on the bonds. This spread covered the issuers' administrative costs, but did not lead to a significant profit. In addition, the maximum rate of interest on the bonds was 6 percent, ensuring that borrowing costs for farmers was often much lower than before the Act was passed.\\" The Act led to the creation of new banks. The new law gave extra financial sympathy to farmers, as stated in a letter to the chair of the United States House Committee on Agriculture: \\"It was essential, however, that banking machinery be devised which would reach intimately into the rural districts, that it should operate on terms suited to the farmer's needs, and should be under sympathetic management.\\" The Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on July 17, 1916. Why Was The FFLA Thought to be Unconstitutional? Charles Smith believed that Congress had overstepped its bounds in creating the Federal Farm Loan Act. \\"It was the contention of Smith, among other things, that although farm loan bonds purported to be tax exempt, Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority in providing for the creation of federal and joint-stock land banks with the power to issue tax- exempt bonds; and that therefore these bonds were improper securities for the investment of trust company funds.\\" Smith thought that Congress did not have the right to create new banks and issue tax exempt bonds. Similarly, Law Writer Charles Enslow challenged the Act prior to Smith stating \\"Congress only has the affirmative power to tax, not the authorization to exempt from taxation any State property. The Federal Farm Loan Bank is nothing more nor less than a corporation chartered by the National Government, and whose sole object is to secure from a certain class of people of the United States money to be loaned to another class of people at a reduced interest rate.\\" Enslow thought that the Act favored farmers over other specialized workers and thought that the government does not have the right to help one group of citizens while leaving others behind. Federal-question Jurisdiction Federal courts have limited jurisdiction compared to state courts. Federal courts can only rule over cases with subject matter dealing with Congress or the Constitution. Federal-question jurisdiction gives the federal court subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a civil case because the appellant has claimed a violation of the Constitution. Federal-question jurisdiction was used by the Supreme Court to hear this case. By claiming the Federal Farm Loan Act unconstitutional, the appellant created a federal suit. ==Issue== Was the District Court allowed to and correct in upholding the Constitutional validity of the Federal Farm Loan Act? ==Holding== The court gave opinions on two separate matters: The District Court's jurisdiction and the Constitutionality of the Federal Farm Loan Act. Jurisdiction of the District Court Justice William R. Day authored the majority opinion for Smith v. KC Title & Trust Co. The Court ruled that \\"even where a cause of action arises under state law, a federal court may have jurisdiction if it appears that the right to relief rests on the construction or application of a federal law.\\" Justice Day ruled that the District Court had jurisdiction, stating, \\"the general rule is that where it appears from the bill or statement of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable, and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has jurisdiction under this provision.\\" So, since this case dealt with federal matters, the Supreme Court ruled that the District Court still has jurisdiction under certain circumstances. Constitutionality of the Federal Farm Loan Act The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court's decision that the Federal Farm Loan Act is, in fact, constitutional. \\"The provision of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916, amended January 18, 1918, making the Federal Land Banks and Joint Stock Land Banks established thereunder depositaries of public money when designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, authorizing their employment as financial agents of the government, requiring them to perform, as such depositaries and agents, such reasonable duties as may be laid upon them, and authorizing them to purchase government bonds justify their creation as an exercise of the constitutional power of Congress. The necessity for such federal agencies is for Congress to determine, and the motives actuating Congress in exercising its power to create them are not a subject for judicial scrutiny.\\"  Dissenting Opinion  Justice Holmes dissented because he thought that the issue did not \\"arise under\\" federal law. He did not think that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction because the cause of action was created by state law and not federal law. ==Effects of the Decision== The upholding of the Federal Farm Loan Act was a decision that improved the livelihood of many American farmers, increased the power of Congress, and helped better define federal-question jurisdiction. After the supreme court ruling, one newspaper headline proclaimed, \\"Decision which Establishes Constitutionality of Agricultural Credit Act Declared Greatest Victory for Farmers. Tax Exempt Feature of Bonds is also Sustained, Many Millions of Dollars of Credit Forthcoming to Farmers.\\" Another newspaper wrote, \\"The decision is expected to aid greatly in relieving the financial distress now confronting agricultural interests. The positive effect that the act had on farmers still holds true today, as one news article posted July 24, 2006 reads, \\"Leaders Celebrate 90 Years of Federal Farm Loan Act.\\" Congress's ability to pass an act that created new banks for farmers that allowed tax exemptions was unprecedented. Also, the Supreme Court's ruling gave a new precedent for federal-question jurisdiction. The ruling for Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co. took power from state law and gave power to federal law. By ruling on the constitutionality of the issue, the Supreme Court took a district case and made it federal. By doing so, the court redefined the boundaries for federal-question jurisdiction. ==See also== * Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. * Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R.

Uniquely among the British group it constructs a nest of barrel-shaped cells in which spiders are stored and the larvae develop. ==Description== Approximately (male ) in length, the male is distinguished by the ivory-coloured maculae alongside the eyes. ==Biology== The flight period in Great Britain is June to August, during which the females construct a nest of barrel-shaped cells in which spiders are stored and the larvae develop. There can be as many as ten cells in a nest and the prey often has its legs amputated to make it easier to carry either by flight or more often by crawling along the ground.http://www.natureconservationimaging.com/Pages/nature_conservation_imaging_heathland1_sh_wasps_Pomp_Aup_car.htm The nesting behaviour is quite complex compared to most other spider wasps and shows the behavioural versatility of the female wasp. The nests are constructed in pre-existing holes in various situations, with reports citing nests beneath stones, in masonry, in tree stumps (often in old beetle burrows), under bark and in crevices of tree trunks, in empty galls of cynipid wasps, in empty burrows of other invertebrates, including other hymenopteran nests. Females create small, barrel-like cells which are laid sideways. These are constructed from small pellets of mud obtained from damp areas of soil and carried to the nest site. Water is also collected separately to aid nest building. Completed nests may consist of ten or more cells arranged in a block. These cells are then stocked with a wide variety of spider species captured from amongst vegetation. One spider is put in each cell. A. carbonarius may occasionally visit flowers such as spurge. The most frequent prey consists of spiders in the family Clubionidae, but they have also been recorded taking Gnaphosidae, Salticidae, Agelenidae, Thomisidae, Lycosidae, Segestriidae and Anyphaenidae. ==Habitat== Woodland, especially that with water courses and marshy areas which provide wet mud and clay for building nests. ==Distribution== Eastern United States, eastern Canada, south eastern England, central Europe and Scandinavia, ==References== Category:Pepsinae Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1763 Category:Taxa named by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli ","title":"Auplopus carbonarius"},{"id":"35277549","text":"Csaba Sz√≥r√°d (born 9 May 1980, in Kom√°rno) is a Slovak football player, currently plays for KFC Kom√°rno. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarians in Slovakia Category:Association football defenders Category:Slovak footballers Category:FC Nitra players Category:M≈†K ≈Ωilina players Category:AS Trenƒç√≠n players Category:Slovak Super Liga players Category:People from Kom√°rno ","title":"Csaba Sz√≥r√°d"},{"id":"35277638","text":"Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir (born 26 January 1948) is a Bangladeshi politician. He is the incumbent secretary general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) since 2016. He was a member of the parliament for Thakurgaon-1 constituency from 2001 to 2006. In that term, he was also appointed as the Minister of State in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and later Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism. ==Early life== Alamgir was born on 26 January 1948 in Thakurgaon District to Mirza Ruhul Amin (d. 2008), a former member of parliament and Mirza Fatima Amin (d. 2018), a homemaker. Alamgir completed his master's in economics from the University of Dhaka ==Political career== Student politics Alamgir was active in student politics at Dhaka University. He was a member of the then East Pakistan Students Union (EPSU), now known as Bangladesh Students Union, and was elected as the secretary general of the organization's SM Hall unit in the university. Alamgir rose through the ranks of EPSU and, at the height of the 1969 uprising against the Ayub Khan administration, he was elected as the organization's Dhaka University president. Teaching and other government positions In 1972, Alamgir became a teacher of economics at Dhaka College. Among other government responsibilities, Alamgir worked for the Bangladesh government's Directorate of Inspection and Audit as an auditor. Alamgir served in the administration of President Ziaur Rahman. He worked as a secretary of Deputy Prime Minister S.A. Bari, until the latter resigned in 1982. Following this, Alamgir taught economics at Thakurgaon Govt. College until 1986. Entry into politics In 1986, with the municipal polls ahead, Alamgir resigned from his government post. He ran for chairman in Thakurgaon municipality in the 1988 municipal elections as a neutral candidate, and won. Alamgir joined BNP amid the countrywide uprising to topple the military regime of Gen Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the early 1990s. In 1992, Alamgir was nominated as president of the BNP's Thakurgaon district unit. Member of parliament and state minister Alamgir ran in the 5th parliamentary election in 1991 from Thakurgaon-1 constituency on the BNP ticket but lost to Awami League candidate Khademul Islam.Ahmed, Burhan Uddin.

The government newly formed by Alamgir's BNP party appointed him Minister of State in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture. A cabinet reshuffle later named him Minister of State in charge of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, where he served until the BNP government left office in October 2006. Alamgir ran again in the 9th parliamentary election in 2008, losing marginally to the Awami League candidate he previously beat, Ramesh Chandra Sen.Ahmed, Burhan Uddin. Parliament Elections Report 1937-2008. Country First Foundation, 2010, p. 150. 5th BNP Council The 5th National Council of BNP in December 2008 named Alamgir senior joint secretary general, a post previously held by Tarique Rahman (now the vice-chairman of the BNP). Alamgir became well known in Bangladesh for his frequent appearance in the media as the BNP's spokesperson, particularly as leader of the opposition to the Awami League-led government that took office in January 2009. BNP‚Äôs acting secretary general Alamgir was named acting secretary general of the BNP by its chairperson, Begum Khaleda Zia, following the death of secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain in March 2011. Some senior BNP figures disputed the nomination, stating that the BNP constitution does not allow for this. The dispute was ruled out on 21 March 2011, hours before Zia left for Saudi Arabia at invitation of the Saudi royal family. Alamgir continued criticizing the government vibrantly on different issues. Upon organizing mass anti-government showdowns, he warned the government to not obstruct the opposition events. The party organized a number of countrywide populous showdowns and agitations against the government, most notably on the issue of the caretaker government, which the Awami League government demolished, enforcing its decisive two- thirds majority in the parliament in 2011. Alamgir's motorcade came under a violent attack by an armed mob in Lakshmipur on 2 August 2011 as it was approaching the main town where Alamgir was about to attend a party meeting. The attackers were not identified, but Alamgir and his companions alleged that they were members of the ruling party, the Awami League. Though Alamgir was unhurt, three vehicles (including the one in which he was riding) were vandalized, and ten people were injured. In February 2012, Alamgir criticized the government for its role in the Pilkhana massacre. He claimed the violence was intended to permanently damage the national security of Bangladesh and accused the Awami League government of not properly investigating the incident. As of March 2012, Alamgir is one of the top contenders to fill the post of BNP's secretary general. ==Personal life== Alamgir is married to Rahat Ara Begum, who attended University of Calcutta and presently works in an insurance company in Dhaka. The couple has two daughters, Mirza Shamaruh and Mirza Safaruh. Shamaruh attended University of Dhaka and was a teacher in the institution. She is now a post doctoral fellow in Australia. Safaruh, also a University of Dhaka graduate, teaches in a school in Dhaka. Alamgir's uncle, Mirza Ghulam Hafiz, was a BNP politician who served as the Minister of Land (1978‚Äì79), Minister of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs (1991‚Äì96), and was elected MP from a Dhaka constituency in 1979. Hafiz was the speaker of the 2nd national parliament of Bangladesh (1979‚Äì82). Another uncle, Wing Commander S. R. Mirza, served in the first government of Bangladesh that was formed in exile (the Mujibnagar Government) in April 1971. He was named to head the newly formed Directorate of Youth Camps that oversaw training facilities for freedom fighter recruits in 1971. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:People from Thakurgaon District Category:University of Dhaka alumni Category:Bangladeshi academics Category:Bangladesh Nationalist Party politicians Category:General Secretaries of Bangladesh Nationalist Party Category:8th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:State Ministers of Agriculture (Bangladesh) Category:State Ministers of Tourism and Civil Aviation (Bangladesh) Category:11th Jatiya Sangsad members ","title":"Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir"},{"id":"35277643","text":"William Ellsworth Kepner (6 January 1893 in Miami, Indiana - 3 July 1982 in Orlando, Florida) was an officer in the United States Army, United States Army Air Corps and United States Air Force, and a pioneer balloonist and airship pilot. ==Early life== He was born on 3 January 1893 in Miami, Indiana. ==World War I== From 1909 to 1913, Kepner served in the US Marine Corps. By 1916 he was a second lieutenant in the Indiana National Guard. After a short spell in the US cavalry, in 1917 he transferred to the infantry as a captain and commanded a company at the Battle of Chateau-Thierry. He subsequently lead the 3rd Battalion of the 4th US Infantry in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. ==Interwar period== Gondola of Explorer I In 1920, at the age of 27, he transferred to the US Army Air Corps and trained as a balloon pilot, then subsequently as an airship pilot. From 1927 to 1929 he participated very prominently in several US national and international balloon races, most notably winning the prestigious Gordon Bennett Cup with co-pilot William Olmstead Eareckson in June 1928. In August 1929 he was commissioned as test pilot of the radical metal-hulled airship ZMC-2, newly completed at Grosse Ile, Michigan. After a successful series of evaluation flights, he flew the airship in September of that year to what was to become its sole home base at Lakehurst, New Jersey, arriving without mishap except for a small perforation in the envelope which press reports of the time claimed to be the result of a pot-shot en route from someone on the ground. Promoted to the rank of major in October 1930, he took command of the Materiel Division's Lighter-than-Air Branch at Wright Field, Ohio. In the period 1930-32, he learned to fly fixed- wing aircraft. Explorer In the summer of 1934, Kepner took command of the joint National Geographic Society - US Army Air Corps Stratosphere Flight near Rapid City, South Dakota to make an attempt with the specially constructed balloon Explorer on the manned balloon altitude record. On 29 July, the balloon ascended with himself and two fellow US Army Air Corp officers, Capt. Albert W. Stevens and Capt. Orvil A. Anderson as crew. However, the attempt nearly ended in tragedy when the balloon envelope ruptured near maximum height, sending the spherical pressurized gondola plunging earthwards. Fortunately, as the gondola reached lower altitudes, all three occupants were able to exit and safely parachute to earth shortly before it crashed. ==World War II== Brigadier General Auton, General Eisenhower, General Spaatz, General Doolittle, Major General William Kepner and Colonel Blakeslee in Debden, England. Ascending through the ranks, in February 1942 he was eventually promoted to Major General in April 1943, and in September of that year took command of VIII Fighter Command in the European Theatre. There he supervised the vital role that the fighters played both as guardians of the 8th Air Force's bombers and as ground-attack support for ground forces, not least in the crucial period around D-Day. In August 1944, Kepner took command of the 8th Air Force's 2nd Bomb Division. During the war he flew 24 combat missions in fighters and bombers and received various decorations from his own country and also from several allied nations. ==Post war== News conference on board USS Appalachian during Operation Crossroads; foreground: Admiral William S.

While Northern (Northwestern) and Southern (Southeastern) «ÉKung are not mutually intelligible, it is not yet clear to what extent Central «ÉKung is intermediate between them or intelligible with either. ==Dialects== Two dialects are identified as being Central «ÉKung based on grammatical features: :(C1) Gaub (Tsumeb district, N Namibia) :(C2) Neitsas (Grootfontein district, N Namibia) In addition, the «ÉKung dialects of Tsintsabis, Leeunes and Mangetti (different from Mangetti Dune) have retroflex clicks and so may belong here, though no grammatical information is available to classify them. In Grootfontein «ÉKung words which Doke (1926) and others have described as having retroflex clicks, Vedder (1910/1911) described a second series of lateral clicks in Gaub «ÉKung. ==Phonology== Grootfontein «ÉKung is unusual in having true retroflex clicks, which are subapical for some speakers and have lateral release, as in the word for 'water', (provisionally written g‚Äº√∫). There are thus five places of articulation in Grootfontein clicks, . These come in eight series, here represented with the retroflex articulation: :Lingual , glottalized , linguo-pulmonic , linguo-glottalic Otherwise, the Grootfontein inventory is similar to that of Ekoka «ÉKung, except that it lacks the (pre)voiced affricates dœá, d í, d í º, d Éœá º.

Wolf, University of Toronto Press, 1991Understanding Organized Crime, by Stephen L. Mallory, Jones & Bartlett, 2007, p. 161 In 1976, the Rebels gained a certain level of notoriety (respect in some circles) due to their much publicized altercations with the Canadian Airborne Regiment. In one of these infamous clashes, about 40 members of the Airborne showed up with nunchaku, steel bars, baseball bats, and blackjacks, and ambushed 23 Rebels at the club bar in Edmonton. After a skirmish, the bruised and battered paratroopers retreated and the Rebels went back to their business.Edmonton Journal, 13 March 1976 In the early eighties, as the Reapers grew more powerful and the Rebels less so, the Rebels were warned by the Reapers not to fly the \\"Alberta\\" lower rocker on threat of club warfare, so members of the Rebel's Calgary chapter used \\"Southern Alberta\\" for the lower rocker and Edmonton members flew \\"Northern Alberta\\". King's Crew, meanwhile, were tolerated in their use of \\"Calgary\\" as the lower rocker, while the Saskatchewan Rebels, at that point being the dominant club in that province, flew \\"Saskatchewan\\" as their lower rocker. In September 1998, the Saskatoon Rebels were patched over to the Hells Angels and the Apollos of Saskatoon became the primary Hells Angels support club there. The Edmonton chapter of the Rebels folded in 1997, soon after the arrest of then secretary-treasurer Scott Jamieson. In 2004, Joey \\"Crazy Horse\\" Morin, a.k.a. Joey Campbell, a former associate of the Edmonton chapter of the Rebels, and Robert Charles Simpson were gunned down outside an Edmonton strip club. At the time of the murders, the Bandidos website identified Morin as a probationary member and Simpson as a hangaround. Sources close to the investigation speculated at the time that Morin and Simpson were in Edmonton to set up shop and the murders were committed by a group opposed to that happening. To date no arrests have been made and the file is still officially open and active.

In 1558 he served on a commission to inquire into the lands held by Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare. The following year he was appointed second justice of the Court of King's Bench.

He is best remembered for his stereo cards of sites around the world, and for his panoramic photographs of sites along the Pennsylvania Railroad. He was official photographer of the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, and of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland in 1905.Turner Browne and Elaine Partnow, MacMillan Biographical Encyclopedia of Photographic Artists and Innovators (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1983), pp. 499-500. His work is now included in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the Getty Museum. ==Life== Rau was born in Philadelphia in 1855, the son of German and Swiss immigrants Peter and Mary Witschi Rau. His older brother, George, operated a photography studio out of the Rau house,John C. Van Horne, Introduction to Traveling the Pennsylvania Railroad: The Photographs of William H. Rau (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002), pp. 1-13. and William picked up the trade while still young. At the age of 13, he started doing photographic work for his future father-in-law, William Bell, who was a medical and survey photographer for the federal government. The Eiffel Tower at night In 1874, with Bell's recommendation, Rau joined an expedition to Chatham Island in the South Pacific to photograph the Transit of Venus. Sailing along the sloop Swatara, Rau photographed some of the world's most remote places while on this expedition.Kenneth Finkel, \\"William H. Rau, Philadelphia, Photography, and the Railroad,\\" Traveling the Pennsylvania Railroad: The Photographs of William H. Rau (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002), pp. 17‚Äì25. He was less successful in capturing the transit itself, however, after his tent caught fire, and cloudy skies obscured most of the transit. None of Rau's photographs of the transit were sharp enough to be of use to scientists. After returning, Rau joined the Centennial Photographic Company, which had been set up by photographer and publisher Edward L. Wilson to conduct photographic work for Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition of 1876. After the exposition, he joined his father-in- law's stereo card studio, which he purchased in 1878. He operated this studio in partnership with his brother, George, until 1880. In 1881, Rau joined Wilson on an expedition to the Middle East. He photographed numerous sites in Egypt, Palestine, and Damascus, and captured some of the earliest photographs of the ruins of Petra.\\"William H. Rau - The Photographer and the Man,\\" Bulletin of Photography, Vol. 21, No. 525 (29 August 1917), pp. 213‚Äì215. The expedition spent 45 days in the desert at one point, and Rau recalled being constantly threatened, harassed, and robbed by locals. The expedition ascended Mount Sinai, but was unable to capture any photographs due to poor lighting. The Dewey Arch in New York Upon returning, Rau went to work full-time for Wilson's magazine, Photographic Journal of America.\\"Death of William H. Rau,\\" The Photographic Journal of America, Vol. 58, No. 1 (January 1921), p. 16. In 1885, he left Wilson's company and set up his own studio in Philadelphia, initially located on Chestnut Street, but later moved to South Camac Street. He operated this studio for the remainder of his life, producing stereo cards, lantern slides, and silver prints. In 1886, Rau made the first of several trips to Europe, photographing sites in Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, France and Italy. In 1889, he accompanied travel writer John Lawson Stoddard on a tour of Mexico. Rau was hired by the Lehigh Valley Railroad to photograph scenic views along the railroad's route in 1891, and became the railroad's official photographer in 1895. He spent a significant portion of the 1890s doing photographic work for both the Lehigh and the Pennsylvania Railroad, and published collections of his railroad photos in 1892 and 1900. Rau complemented his landscape and travel photographs with event photographs. Notable events he covered included the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s, the funeral of President William McKinley in 1901, the eruption of Mount Pel√©e in 1902, the funeral of Admiral William T. Sampson in 1902, the America's Cup race of 1903, the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, and the arrival of the RMS Olympic in New York Harbor in 1911. He was also the official photographer for the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland the following year. With the rise of the Photo-Secession in New York in the 1900s, Rau, like many commercial photographers, gradually fell into obscurity. He died at his home in Philadelphia on November 19, 1920. ==Works== Rau's portrait of President Theodore Roosevelt Rau's photographs span a wide range of topics in places around the world. Cities photographed by Rau include New York City, Paris, Moscow, Cairo, Tokyo, Naples, Nablus, St. Pierre, Martinique, Butte, Montana, and his native Philadelphia. Individuals who posed for portraits for Rau include Theodore Roosevelt, Admiral George Dewey, poet Edwin Markham, Apache chief Geronimo, and Sioux chiefs Luke Little Hawk and Lone Elk. Rau's panoramic subjects include Niagara Falls and Hemlock Lake, and the cities of Rochester and Buffalo in New York and Easton in Pennsylvania.U.S. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, search results for \\"William H. Rau.\\" Accessed: 30 March 2012. In an 1884 article, Rau stated that he preferred cameras with Euryscope lenses and cherry or mahogany cases, oxalate- developed plates, and a Loring finder (for capturing moving subjects).William H. Rau, Edward L. Wilson (ed.), \\"Points for the Beginner,\\" Photographic Mosaics (Philadelphia: Edward L. Wilson, 1884), pp. 129-133. His photographs were typically sold as stereo cards or lantern slides, the latter of which Rau described as the most \\"pleasurable\\" branch of photography.William H. Rau, \\"Lantern-Slides,\\" The American Annual of Photography and Photographic Times Almanac (New York: Scoville Manufacturing Company, 1889), p. 188. For his railroad company panoramics, he used a modified Moessard camera with a Ross portable symmetrical lens,William H.

He printed many of his railroad company photographs on albumen paper to evoke an earlier era, as most photographers had abandoned albumen by the 1890s. Over the past few decades, Rau's work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran Gallery, the Whitney Museum, the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art.

The book was published worldwide in 2012. == Plot == Harry Clifton has joined the American Navy and has assumed the identity of Tom Bradshaw after his ship sinks in order to solve some of his problems, never knowing that he will end up in prison to serve Bradshaw's sentence for desertion. In prison he meets Pat Quinn, from whom he quickly starts learning prison trades. After hard work, he ends up as the prison librarian and begins writing The Diary of a Convict. Back in England, Wallace informs everyone about the death and later the burial of Harry at sea. Emma, who is Giles's sister, is Harry's girlfriend and goes to meet Maisie, Harry's Mother. While the letter by Tom Bradshaw (Harry) is lying on Maisie's mantelpiece, Emma recognizes the handwriting and believes that Harry is still alive. Not allowed to open the letter, she sets out to find Harry. She works on Kansas Star, the ship in which Harry was saved, and from there, she gets to know about the people Tom Bradshaw was with in his last moments. On visiting their home, she realize that Harry himself is Tom and is now in prison. Harry meanwhile writes a diary about his time in prison. When one of his fellow inmates, Max Lloyd, is released, he requests Harry to keep sending him diaries as he enjoys reading them a lot. Max publishes them in his own name. Emma reads the 'Diary of a Convict' and recognizes Harry's handiwork. She begins to try and meet him in prison but the warden says that Harry/Tom has been mysteriously transferred. Harry and Pat are recruited by the US army to cause mayhem behind enemy lines. Giles joins the army and is captured by Germans. He manages to escape but a fellow soldier who was his close friend is killed. He is awarded the Military Cross. Maisie marries Mr Holcombe who was Harry's teacher at Merrywood. Hugo, Harry's real father, fathers an illegitimate child and tries to attack Olga, who is the mother. Olga confronts him with the child, but he refuses to accept the child as his, and proceeds to attack her when she starts to blackmail him. Olga kills him in self-defense and later commits suicide, leaving behind the child. Emma seeks the help of her Great- aunt Phyllis in New York and her son Alistair who is a lawyer. She learns of Harry's recruitment in the army. Harry and Pat are successful in fighting behind enemy lines against the Germans, but Harry is severely injured and Pat is killed when they drive over a land mine. Harry is sent back home to England where he reunites with Emma, Giles and the whole family. The case of Harry v. Giles as to who inherits the title and inheritance as Hugo is dead is taken up by the press. Harry doesn't want the inheritance or the title, he just wants to be with Emma. The last scene in the book is of the House Of Lords adjourning as the resultant vote had been drawn; the book ends with a cliffhanger as the Lord Chancellor announces that he would present his judgment as to who will receive the Barrington fortune the next morning. == Background == The book serves as a sequel to Only Time Will Tell, the first part of the Clifton Chronicles.

The Argus program was strategically designed to train and deploy elite amphibious combat teams able to land in potentially hostile territory and rapidly deploy radar and radio communications equipment, thus paving the way for the beginnings of effective land based fighter aircraft direction. This coordinated fighter direction allowed for interception and prevention of enemy air and surface attacks on allied Pacific bases. The name Argus, referring to a mythological Greek being with 100 eyes, was chosen to symbolize the 'all-seeing' radar of the Argus Units. ==History== In October 1942, five officers arrived at the Advance Base Depot, Port Hueneme, California with orders to assist in setting up the Argus Training program and to serve overseas in the first Argus Unit. By January 1943, the Argus training program was shaping up and included classes covering radar plots on polar coordinate charts, operation of radios, the study of 588, 270 and ASE radars as well as other functions all of which were either at Warehouse \\"I\\" or at outposts. The first commanding officer, Lt.Comdr. Ralph A. Jack A-V(RS) and other administrative officers were stationed at Port Hueneme. On April 23, 1943, Argus Unit 1, consisting of 20 officers and 94 enlisted, shipped out of Port Hueneme for combat duty in the South Pacific. Lt.Comdr. Jack accompanied the unit as commanding officer. Lt.Comdr. Andrew Cowan took his place as commanding officer of the Argus Assembly and Training Detachment. ==Training== On December 12, 1943, Commander Arthur H. Cummings succeeded Lt.Comdr. Cowan as Commanding Officer as the Argus Training detachment moved to spacious new quarters near Point Mugu. The former schedule of producing four Argus Units per month (which inevitably resulted in inadequate training) was reduced to one unit per month, and a new training syllabus was worked out assuring units were far more competent the earlier ones. Improved radar, radio and other gear were obtained for the units by CNO (Op-30-E) under the sponsorship of Commander M.J. West and the future for Argus operations assumed a broader role than ever before. Under the new syllabus, training of enlarged units (21 officers and 220 men) went through three stages: * Primary - six weeks at Port Hueneme during which all personnel received exhaustive basic instruction in Argus functions such as plotting, scope reading, radio telephone procedure, Combat Information Center procedure, and so forth. Each unit was charged with setting up its own gear at an outpost exactly as if at an air strip on a Pacific atoll and conducted interception drills with planes flown from Naval Air Station San Pedro. * Secondary - units relocated to San Clemente island via LST (Landing Ship, Tank). Each unit set up its gear and went through a syllabus containing all types of interception problems, including detecting 'snoopers', controlling searchlight and anti-aircraft batteries, alerting the island of 'enemy' raids, 'homing' lost planes, directing crash boats to pilots downed at sea, maintaining up-to-the-minute intelligence in the CIC of all air and surface activity in the area. * Final Stage - units worked directly with fighter squadrons with emphasis on directing combat air patrols, estimating altitude of 'bogey' aircraft, and running 'night' interceptions, the most difficult of all, in which the intercept officer directs friendly aircraft using the PPI scope of the 527 radar, attempting to bring his fighter aircraft to within combat distance of the 'bogey' aircraft entirely by remote, radar control. ==Deployment== At the completion of the training syllabus the units were ready for combat duty overseas, being a close-knit combat unit, skilled in all Argus functions, self-sufficient and with high morale. These three stages of training simulate the stages in the conquest of a Pacific island - assault, development and occupation. Assault As assaults opened against occupied islands, a task force consisting of carriers, battleships or cruisers and destroyers would strike first, firing on enemy defenses and attacking with available carrier- borne aircraft. Ships bearing a United States Marines amphibious strike force would send strike force troops ashore by landing craft. Fighter Director Officers aboard destroyers close at sea were tasked with directing allied aircraft to intercept and repel any enemy air forces that may have been alerted to the invading strike force. Once a foothold had been established on the island, a selected section of the Argus Unit, known as the first echelon, would deploy ashore carrying radios, portable radars and the basics of necessary equipment. These first elements of the Argus Units would take over parts of the fighter direction role from the destroyers at sea and become the chief component in detecting and warning of approaching enemy air and surface attacks. As the invading force's position gained strength and became secure against counter-offensive attacks from any enemy forces still present, the assault stage transitioned to the development stage. Development In the island development stage, a Navy ACORN unit, composed of a Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) and other components, construct an airfield. Simultaneously, the remainder of the Argus Unit moved in in waves, setting up the long range 270 radars, the fighter direction 527 radar and surface search radars (such as SO-7M). These remaining Argus personnel are also responsible for erecting the Combat Information Center, the radio tent and telephone lines and for establishing a liaison with Air Command, anti-aircraft batteries, searchlight batteries, PT Boat squadrons, crash boats and other relevant commands. Fighter direction and air warning roles were supplied for the base by the Argus Unit while continuous contact was maintained with other Argus Units and surface forces in the immediate area. Occupation As the island transitioned to an occupation stage, the Army Air Corps assumed control of the airfield and set up permanent airfield and air warning facilities. The Argus Unit returned to a staging point for rest and replacements. ==References== * Record of Argus Assembly and Training Detachment, Port Hueneme, California - April 1944 - United States Navy * Science and the Pacific War: Science and Survival in the Pacific, 1939-1945 - Kluwer Academic Publishers - Edited by Roy.

The gang was founded by Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis, and later joined by Fred's brother Arthur \\"Doc\\" Barker. Along with the three core members, the gang's network spanned up to 25 members at one point. Although not as well known as their contemporaries the Dillinger Gang, or the Barrow Gang, the Barker-Karpis Gang was perhaps more ruthless, not only committing bank robberies, but also extending the activities into kidnapping.Burrough, Bryan (2009) Public Enemies, Penguin It is best known for the myth that it was run by the Barker brothers' mother, Kate, usually referred to as \\"Ma Barker\\". ==Foundations== The Barker‚ÄìKarpis gang was put together by Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis in March 1931. Barker and Karpis had met in the Kansas State Penitentiary, and upon Karpis's release in March 1931, started to form the gang. The gang began robbing banks starting in mid-1931, but on December 19 of that year, they killed Howell County, Missouri Sheriff Calvin Roy Kelly in West Plains, Missouri. They fled to Joplin, and then to Saint Paul, Minnesota where crime boss Harry Sawyer (born Harry Sandlovich) found them a house at 1031 Roberts Road, owned by Helen Hannegraff. They used the name \\"Anderson\\", but a few weeks later, Helen's son Nick recognized Alvin's and Fred's photos in a copy of True Detective Magazine, and contacted the police. The corrupt chief of police, Thomas A \\"Big Tom\\" Brown, tipped the Barkers off and they left town. Doc Barker later joined the gang in 1932 after he was paroled from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, where he had been serving a life sentence for the murder of night watchman Thomas J. Sherrill in 1921. The gang was led by the three of them, although many others rotated in and out of the gang including Fred Goetz and Volney Davis. The gang continued their bank robbing activities until mid-1933, when they decided that robbing banks was becoming risky, and therefore decided to diverge into the field of kidnapping.Winter, Robert (2000) Mean Men : The Sons of Ma Barker, Rutledge Books Their graduation to more serious crime was mentored by Brown.Mahoney, Tom, Secret Partners: Big Tom Brown and the Barker Gang, Minnesota Historical Society, 2013, p.4. ==Hamm and Bremer kidnappings== On June 15, 1933, the Barker‚ÄìKarpis gang kidnapped William Hamm of Hamm's Brewery and released him on June 19, 1933. The ransom from this kidnapping netted $100,000. They then kidnapped Edward Bremer in daylight in St. Paul in January 1934, releasing him in February. The ransom from this kidnapping turned out to be $200,000. However, these kidnappings brought too much negative publicity, due to the recent Urschel and Lindbergh Kidnappings, and the fact that the father of the Bremer Jr. was a personal friend of President Roosevelt, who mentioned the kidnappings in a fireside chat. On November 27, 1934, Lester \\"Baby Face Nelson\\" Gillis, at that time the Public Enemy No. 1, was mortally wounded in a gun battle with the FBI and died later that night. The next day, Alvin Karpis was declared Public Enemy No. 1, which brought the full force of the FBI down on the Barker-Karpis Gang.Maccabee, Paul (1995) John Dillinger Slept Here, Minnesota Historical Society PressMahoney, Tim (2013) Secret Partners, Minnesota Historical Society Press ==Downfall== The cottage in which Ma and Fred Barker were killed. They both died in the upper left bedroom. The gang had faced problems. George \\"Shotgun\\" Ziegler had been gunned down in Cicero, Illinois in March 1934, possibly due to the mob's dislike of the gang's activities. Gang member William J. Harrison was killed on January 6 by fellow members of the gang. Following the declaration of Alvin Karpis as Public Enemy No. 1, Doc Barker was arrested on January 8, 1935, along with Byron Bolton. Russell \\"Slim Gray\\" Gibson was killed resisting the arrest. Along with his arrest came a map and letters to a cottage near Lake Weir, Florida, near Ocklawaha, in which Fred Barker and his mother, Kate \\"Ma\\" Barker were hiding under an assumed name. After a four-hour shootout on January 16, 1935, Fred and Ma Barker were killed. Controversy remains as to whether Ma Barker participated in the shootout, or was even a criminal at all. Alvin Karpis was nearly gunned down in Atlantic City, New Jersey, around the same time. Karpis stayed on the move for another 16 months, pulling an armored car robbery and a train robbery in April and October 1935, before finally being arrested in New Orleans on May 1, 1936 alongside new accomplice Fred Hunter. Although Director J. Edgar Hoover personally claimed credit for Karpis's arrest, Hoover and the official FBI account of the arrest remains in question. Karpis offers his own version of the arrest in his book, The Alvin Karpis Story. The arrest of Karpis brought the FBI to fame and skyrocketed their public standing, along with J. Edgar Hoover's reputation. ==Aftermath== Doc Barker was sent to Alcatraz in the summer of 1935. Alvin Karpis soon followed upon his own arrest. Many other members of the gang ended up at Alcatraz prison. Doc Barker ended up being shot dead while attempting to escape in 1939. While at McNeil Island Penitentiary Karpis began to teach guitar to the young Charles Manson, then known as ‚ÄúLittle Charlie‚Äù. Karpis was sympathetic to Manson‚Äòs tumultuous, institutionalized upbringing which saw him in countless orphanages, reformatories, and prisons all throughout his young life. Karpis later wrote ‚Äúit (was) time someone did something for him.‚Äù He later said, \\"There was something unmistakably unusual about Manson. He was a runt of sorts, but found his place as an experienced manipulator of others. I did feel manipulated, and under circumstances where it hadn't been necessary.\\" Karpis was paroled in 1969, and deported to Canada. He moved to Spain in 1973. Karpis co-wrote two books with professional authors, one released in 1971 titled The Alvin Karpis Story, the other, released in 1979, titled On the Rock. He died on August 30, 1979, of natural causes, though it was initially believed to be a suicide or the result of foul play.Karpis, Alvin and Livesey, Robert (1980) On the Rock: Twenty-Five Years in Alcatraz, Beaufort Books ==Summary of Barker‚ÄìKarpis Gang activities== Background 1900‚Äì1920 * 1910‚ÄîHerman Barker arrested for highway robbery in Webb City, Missouri. * March 5, 1915‚ÄîHerman Barker arrested for highway robbery in Joplin, Missouri.

The FAR was responsible for the defense of the Kingdom since its independence in October 1953 from France. ==History== The foundations of the Royal Lao Armed Forces were laid on 11 May 1947, when King Sisavang Vong granted a constitution declaring Laos an independent nation (and a Kingdom from 1949) within the colonial framework of French Indochina. This act signalled the creation of a Laotian government capable of building its own administration over the next few years, including the establishment of a national defense force. The new Laotian military was officially created on 1 July 1949 from a collection of pre-existing Lao police and militarized constabulary units, regular colonial indigenous troops, and locally raised irregular auxiliaries. However, the formation process was soon hampered by the developments of the ongoing First Indochina War in neighbouring Vietnam, and it was only in 1952 that the National Laotian Army (French: Arm√©e Nationale Laoti√®nne or ANL) ‚Äì the predecessor of the Royal Lao Armyhttp://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+la0030) ‚Äì really began to take shape. By July 1959, it was known as the Laotian Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es Laoti√®nnes ‚Äì FAL), and in September 1961, was renamed Royal Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es du Royaume ‚Äì FAR).Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), pp. 5‚Äì7; 13. ==Command structure== Throughout its existence, the Laotian Armed Forces were plagued by an ineffective leadership, particularly at senior levels, which often led to chain-of-command problems. The earlier colonial ANL units in the French Protectorate of Laos consisted mostly of uneducated Laotian peasant recruits led by French officers and senior NCOs; those few Laotians promoted from the ranks rose no further than the command of a company. After the Kingdom of Laos gained its independence in late 1953, the few Laotian officers with military experience were quickly promoted to much higher command positions than they were accustomed to. To further aggrieve matters, the Laotian military upper echelons of command were not immune to political interference, in the form of patronage, cronyism and nepotism, since many officers were also commissioned into senior command posts directly from civilian life; they tended to gain their posts through family connections rather than any military training or ability. The few urban elite families who dominated Laotian society felt it advantageous to have family members or friends in key posts of the military establishment.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), pp. 11‚Äì13. These politically-appointed officers indulged in political manoeuvres (the 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1966, and 1973 Laotian coups) or involved themselves in profitable illicit activities (bribery, kickbacks, racketeering, gambling, prostitution, gold-smuggling, and the Opium trade), rather than learning their trade. As a result, the FAR officer corps was riven by corruption and inefficiency, exacerbated by political divisions and even personal rivalries at all echelons of command. Both professional and personal jealousy was not unknown amongst Laotian higher Commanders, which resulted in endless internal squabbles, and little effort was made to coordinate their activities. This situation was further complicated by a decentralised command structure, in which the FAR General Staff (French: √âtat-Major G√©n√©rale ‚Äì EMG) in Vientiane served primarily an administrative function, exerting little control over the regional commands and local commanders were free to adjust their tactics to the local situation. Laos had a long-standing \\"warlord\\" tradition of local power-brokers, and consequently, real power was in the hands of the regional commanders (usually Colonels or Generals) who manned the military districts (or \\"Military Regions\\" ‚Äì MR) in the provinces, which operated like autonomous fiefdoms. With the formation of the Mobile Groups (French: Groupements mobiles ‚Äì GMs) at each Laotian Military Region in the early 1960s, the MR Commanders' influence was challenged by the growing power of the GM Commanders (Majors or Lieutenant colonels), who acted as junior \\"warlords\\".Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960‚Äì75 (1989), p. 12.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 14.Fall, Anatomy of a Crisis: The Laotian Crisis of 1960‚Äì1961 (1969), p. 17.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 5. In practice, the Military Region's commanders used the GMs as their private armies to further their own interests, rarely dispatching them outside the Mekong River valley.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), p. 14. A high-echelon command position within a Military Region was dependent upon the influence of an urban elite aristocratic family who economically and politically dominated the MR. If a general was not a scion of one of these families, then he had to get their support in some other manner.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 70, note 47. Regional commands Laos was divided since 1955 into five Military Regions (R√©gions Militaires in French) roughly corresponding to the areas of the country's 13 provinces.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960‚Äì75 (1989), p. 4. The Military Regions were the basis of the warlordism culture that affected the ANL and the FAR high command, with most of the MR Commanders running their zones like private fiefdoms.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), p. 14. ==Branches== By September 1961 the Royal Lao Armed Forces consisted of three conventional ground, air and naval branches of service. Their primarily roles were: guarantee the sovereignty of the King, ensure internal stability and security by maintaining the social and political order, and defend the Kingdom of Laos against external aggression. Subordinated to the Ministry of Defense of the Royal Lao Government at the capital Vientiane, the FAR branches were organized as follows: * Royal Lao Army (French: Arm√©e Royale du Laos ‚Äì ARL) * Royal Lao Air Force (French: Aviation Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì AVRL) * Royal Lao Navy (French: Marine Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì MRL) Elite formations Auto Defense de Choc (ADC) Hmong guerrilla company assembles at Phou Vieng, Spring 1961. * Royal Lao Army Airborne * Military Region 5 Commandos * Commando Raider Teams * SPECOM * Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) * Directorate of National Coordination ==Training institutions== Prior to its independence in October 1953, Laos lacked almost completely a professional military school system ‚Äì Officer, Non-commissioned officer (NCO) and Staff schools, plus Technical and Branch training schools ‚Äì for its Armed Forces, and relied heavily on foreign assistance to train its personnel. Beginning in the early 1950s, Laotian Officers and selected enlisted men were sent overseas to attend specialized courses and advanced schools, and this practice would continue throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. However, a small indigenous training infrastructure (initially run exclusively by the French) gradually began to take shape during the last years of the First Indochina War, and as the Laotian Civil War progressed, it was expanded with the help of the American aid programs, with most of the training being carried out by U.S. advisors. Lao Military Academy and Staff College The first Laotian military schools were established by the French Union Army Command in 1952, with the creation at Pakse and Vientiane of two NCO training schools (French: √âcole des Cadres), later merged into a single institution, the Reserve Cadres Training Centre (French: Centre de Formation des Cadres de R√©serve ‚Äì CFCR), soon followed by a Reserve Officers Training School (French: √âcole des Officiers de Reserve ‚Äì EOR).Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 17. First set up at Pakse, the latter institution was later transferred to Dong Hene in Savannakhet Province, which eventually became the Lao Military Academy.Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 19. A Staff and Command school, the Military Institution of Higher Learning (French: Institut des hautes √©tudes militaires ‚Äì IHEM),Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 18. and an Accountancy School (French: √âcole de Comptabilit√©) were also established at the time in Vientiane. Laotian Armed Forces training Centres Six Laotian Armed Forces training Centres (French: Centres de Formation des Forces Arm√©es Laoti√©nnes ‚Äì CFFAR) were established jointly by the French and U.S. Operation Hotfoot mobile training team advisors at Khang Khay in Military Region 2 (MR 2), at Kilometre 17 (KM 17) and Kilometre 22 (KM 22) both located northeast of Vientiane on Route 13, and at Luang Prabang, Savannakhet and Pakse between July 1959 and March 1960, in order to provide basic infantry and Ranger training to both regular RLA and irregular SGU Laotian troops.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), pp. 7-8.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 23‚Äì24. Airborne training centres To train Laotian paratrooper battalions, airborne training centres were established by the French at Wattay Air Base just outside Vientiane in September 1948, followed later in February 1960 by Vang Vieng, located 17 kilometres (15.60 miles) from Vientiane, set up with the help of U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (Laos) advisors, and at Seno, near Savannakhet by French Military Mission in Laos advisors.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960‚Äì75 (1989), pp. 24; 33. A fourth Parachute School was briefly established by the Neutralists in 1961 at Muang Phanh in Xiangkhouang Province, but the Pathet Lao offensive held in early May 1964 forced the training staff to relocate to Vang Vieng.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 15‚Äì19. Commando and infantry training centres In the midst of the 1971 reorganization, two dual commando/infantry training centres were set up by the Americans at Phou Khao Khouai, north of Vientiane and Seno near Savannakhet for the Royal Lao Army (RLA) new strike divisions.

To meet the threat represented by the Pathet Lao insurgency, the Laotian Armed Forces depended on a small French military training mission (French: Mission Militaire Fran√ßaise pr√®s du Gouvernment Royale du Laos ‚Äì MMFI-GRL),Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), pp. 24; 33. headed by a general officer, an exceptional arrangement permitted under the 1955 Geneva Accords, as well as covert assistance from the United States in the form of the Programs Evaluation Office (PEO), established on 15 December 1955, replaced in 1961 by the Military Assistance Advisory Group (Laos), which was later changed in September 1962 into the Requirements Office.Ahern, Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos (2006), pp. 52; 55. Between 1962 and 1971, the U.S. provided Laos with direct military assistance, but not including the cost of equipping and training irregular and paramilitary forces by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Castle, At War in the Shadow of Vietnam (1993), pp. 9-12; 15-19. Laotian student candidate officers (French: Aspirants) and senior officers were first sent to France, and later Thailand and the United States, to receive basic officer and advanced staff training in their respective Military Academies and Staff Colleges. At least ten Laotian Aspirants were sent to the prestigious Saint Cyr Military Academy (French: √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr) in France, whilst senior officers attended staff courses at the School of Advanced Military Studies (French: Centre des hautes √©tudes militaires) in Paris;Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), pp. 17‚Äì18. other Laotian officers received their staff training at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

At the end of his life he was known as John Wastie. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Oxford from 1807 until 1818, and again from 1820 until 1830. He was Recorder of Romsey until 1834, and was Recorder of Oxford from March 1834 until his death the following year. ==Life== John Ingram Lockhart, of Sherfield House, near Romsey, Hampshire, and Great Haseley House, Oxfordshire, was the youngest son of three children of James Lockhart of Melchett Park, Wiltshire, and London, a partner in Lockhart, Wallace, and Co., bankers, Pall Mall; his mother was Mary Harriot Gray, of the Society of Friends. James Lockhart was his brother. Lockhart was baptised on 3 October 1765 at St Dunstan-in-the-East, London. He went to Eton College in 1779, and then University College, Oxford under the tutelage of Edward Hawtrey (1741‚Äì1803), where he matriculated on 5 May 1783, aged 17. He entered Lincoln's Inn 7 May 1783, studied 1786 to 1787 another year of law at G√∂ttingen UniversityJohanna Oehler, Abroad in G√∂ttingen, Wallstein, G√∂ttingen 2016, p. 462 and was called to the bar on 14 June 1790. He went the Oxford circuit, and was created Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) on 14 June 1820. At one point Lockhart was political agent for Henry Peters in the Oxford seat. Later, in 1802, he stood for the seat himself; and Peters, after some delay, declined the contest. In the 1812 he beat George Eden, the Duke of Marlborough's candidate, into third place. In 1827, Lockhart purchased 210 acres in North- Marston, Buckingham belonging to yeoman William Flower, previously the property of Charles and Richard Watkins, of Daventry, Northampton (who held that estate in 1775). Lockhart unsuccessfully contested Oxford 1802, 1806, 1818, and 1830, but represented it 1807‚Äì18, and 1820‚Äì30. He was Recorder of Romsey until October 1834, appointed Deputy Recorder of Oxford to Sir William Elias Taunton (1773‚Äì1835) in 1830, and succeeded that distinguished Judge as Recorder of Oxford March 1835, but died at Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, England on 13 August following, aged 70. ==Family== Lockhart was married on 14 January 1804 to Mary Gilkes-Wastie, the only child and heir of Francis Wastie of Cowley (d.1775), and Great-Haseley House, and took the name of Wastie in lieu of Ingram-Lockhart by Act of Parliament 12 October 1831. The change of name was to enable him to hold his wife's estates after her death. ==References== *Austen-Leigh, Richard Arthur. The Eton College register, 1753‚Äì1790....

Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 68. Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster UK, 2003. ISSN 1368-485X ==Design and development== The aircraft was designed in the 1980s to comply with German rules which are very stringent regarding safety and noise. It features a paraglider-style high-wing, single-place accommodation and a single Solo 210 engine in pusher configuration, with a hand throttle control. As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. As the company's first product it was initially known as just the Fresh Breeze, but as other models were added it was renamed the Solo for its fitted engine, the Solo 210. To comply with German safety requirements the Solo was initially designed with a harness that allowed jettisoning the engine package in flight. This was required to reduce the risk of the pilot drowning in the event of a water landing and also to deal with a possible engine fire in flight. This feature survives in the present day Solo Jettison model. To meet noise requirements the small two-stroke engine has a complex \\"wrap-around\\" style exhaust and extra-long muffler system that results in a low sound output. The engine cylinder head is modified to improve cooling and drives a two-bladed carbon fibre propeller. ==Variants== ;Fresh Breeze :Initial name given to the model, as the company's first product. ;Solo CB :Model with \\"comfort bar\\" flexible push rods that counteract engine torque. ;Solo Jettison :In production in 2012, this model retains the jettisonable engine feature of the earliest models. ==Specifications (Fresh Breeze) References * Category:1980s German ultralight aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Paramotors Solo ","title":"Fresh Breeze Solo"},{"id":"35278460","text":"The Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association was founded in 1900 at a time when women were banned from joining the existing Post and Telegraph Association.

In 2006, there were four organisations where individual members were qualified as electorates although they were not allowed to vote in the general meetings, such as the Professional Information Security Association and the Hong Kong and Mainland Software Industry Corporation Association. Since 2003, members of the pro-Beijing Internet Professional Association (iProA) are also eligible to vote in the constituency, which helped its pro-Beijing member Samson Tam to take the seat from pro-democrats' hand in the 2008 Legislative Council election. In 2006, there were 4,743 individuals (94.9% of the electorate) and 261 registered corporations (4.1% of the electorate). In 2016, it saw an 80% surge in the number of registered voters, from 6,716 in 2012 to 12,046 in 2016, according to provisional voter statistics released by the Registration and Electoral Office. Incumbent legislator Charles Mok questioned whether pro-Beijing forces were getting people to sign up. In April 2017, the Independent Commission Against Corruption arrested 72 people over alleged vote-rigging, 68 of them were newly registered electors and four were middlemen, three of whom were registered voters. A source identified them as the members of the Internet Professional Association (iProA) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), Hong Kong section, computer chapter. ==Returned members== {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Election!!Member!!Party - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1998  Sin Chung-kai  Democratic Party - style=\\"background-color: \\"   2008  Samson Tam Wai-ho  Independent - style=\\"background-color: \\"   2012  Charles Peter Mok  Professional Commons } ==Electoral results== 2010s 2000s 1990s ==References== Category:Constituencies of Hong Kong Category:Constituencies of Hong Kong Legislative Council Category:Functional constituencies (Hong Kong) Category:1998 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Constituencies established in 1998 ","title":"Information Technology (constituency)"},{"id":"35278694","text":"The 2012 Georgia State Panthers baseball team represented Georgia State University in the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball season.

He was recruited by in the 2010 national draft, with pick 76, and traded to Adelaide at the end of the 2015 season. Seedsman grew up supporting Collingwood; his great-grandfather, Jim Sharp, played for and Collingwood, and was president of Collingwood for 12 years. ==Pre-AFL career== Seedsman attended Heany Park Primary School and Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne and played junior football for the Rowville Football Club. ==AFL career== Collingwood (2011-2015) After playing out 2011 in Collingwood's VFL side, averaging 17 disposals, Seedsman made his debut in round 1 of the 2012 season, against . He established himself in the team in 2013, playing 17 matches and averaging 18.9 disposals as a rebounding defender capable of pushing onto the wing and forward. During the same season, he was also at the heart of a fallout between teammate Harry O'Brien and coach Nathan Buckley, with O'Brien reportedly taking issue with his teammates and Buckley calling Seedsman 'Lez' (a reference to his hairstyle at the time). Seedsman injured his hip during the 2014 pre-season, requiring surgery. He returned to the side mid-season, before succumbing to an adductor injury ahead of Collingwood's round 19 match against . In October 2015, after playing 12 games for the season but only two after round 12, Seedsman requested a trade to . He was officially traded to Adelaide on 19 October, having played 49 games for Collingwood. Adelaide (2016-) At the Crows Seedsman was able to complete his first full pre-season of training for the first time in three years. He played in all three games for Adelaide in the 2016 NAB Challenge, impressing in the third and final match against where he collected 23 disposals and kicked a goal. Seedsman played his first game for Adelaide, and 50th overall, against in round 1. After a good start, Seedsman injured himself in a tackle in the final quarter of the round 3 match against , but was still able to play the next week. Later in the season, in a clash against , Seedsman had a relatively easy set shot to put the Crows in front. Though he is known as a reliable kick, he was unable to kick the goal and the Crows lost the match by 26 points when Geelong scored the next four goals. Teammate Daniel Talia stressed after the match that the miss wasn‚Äôt responsible for their loss. In the lead-up to the round 14 clash with , Seedsman injured his hamstring in training, sidelining him from the team for several weeks. When he recovered, rather than going straight back into the AFL side he played his first SANFL match with the reserves team against , where he starred with 29 possessions and a game-high 10 clearances. He was brought back into the AFL side the next week to face off against his former side for the first time. Late in the season Seedsman had a corked buttock and was forced to miss several AFL games. Due to this injury Seedsman was given a special permit to play in the Crows‚Äô first ever SANFL final in spite of not playing enough SANFL matches throughout the season to qualify. He ended up being a late withdrawal for the elimination final, but was brought into the side to play in the semi-final against . In 2017, Seedsman‚Äôs pre-season was interrupted by a groin injury. His recovery took longer than expected and meant he wasn‚Äôt able to play any AFL at the beginning of the season. It wasn‚Äôt until May that he was able to return to full training, then he started playing in the SANFL again in June. He played his first SANFL game for the season in a two-point win over . After consistent from in the SANFL, Seedsman played his first AFL game for the season in round 19 against . Though he wasn‚Äôt able to keep his spot in the AFL side, he continued to impress in the SANFL, with an outstanding match against , getting a game-high 29 disposals and also kicking three goals.

Hussein's proposal was rejected by most parties involved soon after it was announced. == Overview == On 15 March 1972, King Hussein of Jordan revealed his plan for a \\"United Arab Kingdom\\", which would be a federation consisting of two federal districts: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and a Palestinian federal district in the West Bank region that was under Jordanian control between 1948 and 1967, with East Jerusalem being its capital. According to the proposal, the two districts of the federation would be autonomous except for military, foreign affairs and security, which would be run by a central government in Amman. Nevertheless, King Hussein conditioned the establishment of the United Arab Kingdom in achieving a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. Ultimately, King Hussein's proposal was ruled out after it had been rejected by Israel and the PLO, and other Arab states had strongly opposed the plan.Kamal Salibi, The Modern History of Jordan (I. B. Tauris, 2006), pp. 251‚Äì52The Milwaukee Journal ‚Äì Google News Archive Search == Reactions ==  Palestinians  In the eyes of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the plan meant an end to the Palestinian struggle and a denial of their own objectives. Its strong opposition was expressed in a statement issued by the PLO's executive committee, which met immediately after the plan was announced: The Palestinian National Council went further in calling for the overthrow of King Hussein: \\"[we must] engage in a struggle to liberate Jordan from the subservient royalist regime which is a mask for the effective Zionist domination of the East Bank and acts as a hired guardian of the Zionist occupation of Palestine\\".  Israel  Israel's response was immediate and negative. On the same day that Hussein's announcement was broadcast, the spokesman of the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, denied that Israel had any involvement with the plan and described it as \\"negating the cause of peace\\" and that it \\"creates obstacles on the road to its achievement.\\" The Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, dismissed the announcement as \\"mere words, which do not open a pathway to any agreement or solution\\". The following day, Golda Meir made a statement to the Knesset where the plan was debated and a resolution passed. The Knesset resolution rejected the plan:  Arab states  The reaction from the Arab world to King Hussein's proposal was hostile. Most Arab states rejected the idea outright and stated that it had been planned in concert with the United States and Israel to undermine the interests of the Palestinians. They also saw the plan as an attempt by Hussein to sign a unilateral Jordanian peace agreement with Israel, separate from the other Arab states. Egypt, Syria and Libya were among the harshest critics, Egypt went to the extent of breaking off diplomatic relations with Jordan on April 6, 1972. The President of Iraq, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, condemned the plan and announced that \\"the masses of the Arab world are looking to all of us for unified action against the reactionary plan for surrender to the Zionist enemy\\". Al-Bakr proposed a Union of Arab Republics instead. Some Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, did not immediately come out against the proposal, but its rejection by the Arab world was eventually almost universal. ==See also== *Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank *Black September ==References Sources == * The Palestine Question, Henry Cattan, p. 305 * A History of Modern Palestine, Ilan Papp√©, p. 211 ==External links == * King Hussein's federation plan (1972) - the full original text of the proposal * King Hussein's federation plan (March 15 1972) - English translation of the transcript. * Israeli Prime minister Meir's statement and Knesset Resolution passed in response to the plan (16 March 1972) * The Sydney Morning Herald (March 17, 1972) - contemporary news article reporting the initial reaction to the plan.

Her father had previously served in the Austro-Hungarian Army as an officer during World War I, and the family moved to Vienna to escape B√©la Kun's Hungarian Soviet Republic. Once the regime was overthrown, the family moved back to Budapest. Her family was wealthy, and often held parties where D√°n would meet many different people from various stations in life. At 14, D√°n became a national champion in figure skating. She attended in Budapest and graduated in 1929. D√°n married Ferenc Engel in 1931 and Andor Rapoch in 1936. She met Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann during a trip he made to Budapest prior to the outbreak of World War II. In 1938, von Neumann's first marriage ended in a divorce, and D√°n divorced Rapoch to marry him. == Work == After their wedding, D√°n emigrated to the United States with von Neumann, where he held a professorship at Princeton University. In 1943, von Neumann moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to work on calculations as part of the Manhattan Project. D√°n remained at Princeton until 1946, working at the university's Office of Population Research. After the war, D√°n joined von Neumann in New Mexico to program the MANIAC I machine, which could store data, designed by her husband and Julian Bigelow. She then worked on the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) on a project with von Neumann to produce the first successful meteorological forecast on a computer. D√°n designed new controls for ENIAC and was one of its primary programmers. She trained a group of people drawn from the Manhattan Project to store programs as binary code. After her husband's death from cancer in 1957, D√°n wrote the preface to his Silliman Lectures. The lectures were published in 1958 and later edited and published by Yale University Press as The Computer and the Brain. D√°n married oceanographer and physicist Carl Eckart in 1958 and moved to La Jolla, California. She died in 1963 when she drove from her home in La Jolla to the beach and walked into the surf and drowned.

Its core members are Scott Hartley, Chris Garibaldi, Chris Cardwell, and Michael Judd. Suneaters‚Äô debut LP ‚ÄúOne‚Äù was released in October 2011 on Lotuspool Records, an independent record label started by Chris Garibaldi in the early 1990s. Suneaters advocate what they call a DIT (Do-it-together) culture ‚Äì a variation on the DIY (Do-it-yourself) punk rock ethos. DIT emphasizes collaboration, collective action, art sharing, and experimentation in fracturing the dominant music industry paradigms. ==History== Suneaters blossomed from the quiet demise of Los Angeles, California glam rock band, Dr.Doctor. Dr.Doctor, which began as a mere diversion, was directed by G, artist Mark Silverberg, and writer/actor Michael McMillian. Due to external artistic commitments, Dr.Doctor was unable to sustain its early mass and velocity. Chris Garibaldi, returning to Kansas City from L.A., recruited Scott Hartley, a local Dadaist, to play bass, and David Saab, poet/attorney/raconteur, on drums, aspiring to reignite The Doctor‚Äôs flame. This trio formed the nascent Suneaters. After releasing \\"Suneaters I\\" in 2011, an experiment in pop and psychedelic noise \\"controlled\\" by their instruments, Suneaters recorded \\"Suneaters XIII\\" in 2012, a soundtrack for McMillian's short film, \\"Charlie 13\\". The band then focused on playing live, attempting to rely less on pedals/electronics for sound, honing their playing, and writing the stripped down, aspirationally yacht rock, love tribute, \\"Suneaters II: Loving Relationship\\". For this album released in 2015, Hartley and Gee recruited now permanent members Chris Cardwell and Michael Judd. To promote \\"Suneaters II: Loving Relationship\\", the band enlisted the filmmaking skills of W. Dave Keith to make a video version of the entire album. The film incorporated the directorial skills of Keith, Annie Walsh, Rachael Jane, Haley Chaffin, and Allison Flom. Keeping with the trend of following ascending albums (\\"I\\", \\"II\\") with descending albums (\\"XIII\\"), Suneaters released \\"Suneaters XII: L‚Äôappel Du Vide\\" in 2017. This album was a compilation of twisted dance tracks Hartley created mostly with electronics. ==Musical style and Philosophy== Suneaters cite as their primary musical influences SST Records, Led Zeppelin, Hanatarash, Flipper, INXS, Kool Keith, and Graham Nash. Suneaters purposefully eschew traditional live performance venues, opting instead to perform at events or unconventional locations such as leftist political rallies, knitting circles, flea markets, film festivals, tournaments, independent retail establishments, and meadows. Suneaters claim that nothing valuable can result from playing in the jaded and indoctrinated environment of the rock and roll club. The band claims this philosophy is largely a product of more than 25 years of Suneaters‚Äô members participating in traditional club-playing bands. Suneaters live performances are derivative of Allan Kaprow‚Äôs classic ‚Äúhappenings.‚Äù incorporating children, animals, direct audience confrontation, food, film, and prose. They claim live actions to be the most pure way to create an egalitarian DIT culture in which everyone and everything has discernible value and can contribute their art, whatever it may be. ==Band members== Current members * Scott Hartley ‚Äì vocals, bass (2008‚Äìpresent) * Chris Garibaldi ‚Äì vocals, guitar (2008‚Äìpresent) * Michael Judd ‚Äì vocals, guitar (2015‚Äìpresent) * Nick Carroll ‚Äì drums, percussion (2020‚Äìpresent) Former members * David Saab ‚Äì vocals, drums (2008‚Äì2014) * Chris Cardwell ‚Äì vocals, drums, percussion (2015‚Äì2019) ==Discography== * Suneaters I (2011) * Suneaters XIII (2012) * Suneaters II: Loving Relationship (2015) * Suneaters XII: L‚Äôappel Du Vide (2017) * Suneaters III: Unfathomable Darkness (2019) Timeline ==References== * Tough, Paul.

It forms part of the collection of worship sites that comprise the Nagarparkar Temples. An account of its building is contained in \\"Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\\" by Pritivimala, composed in Samvat 1650 and \\"Shri Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\\" written by Nemavijaya in Samvat 1807.Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275 According to Muni Darshanvijaya,Jain Paramparano Itihas, Munishi Darshanvijaya, Jnanavijaya, Nyayavijaya, Charitra Smarak Granthamala, Ahmedabad, 1960, p. 739-743 it was installed by Seth Godidas of Jhinjhuvad and was consecrated by Acharya Hemachandra at Patan in Samvat 1228. It was brought to Patan and was buried underground for safekeeping during a period of disturbance. It was rediscovered in 1375‚Äì76 and was stored in the stable of the local ruler. According to the old texts, a merchant Megha Sa from Nagarparkar acquired the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka) and brought to Nagarparkar, where it was formally reconsecreted by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha. Later, according to instructions he received in a dream, he settled a new town at Godipur and constructed a temple in samvat 1444, thus establishing the Godi Parshvanth Tirth. The construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi. The shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The tirth became famous and was visited by the Jains from afar. It was visited by Stanley Napier Raikes in 1854.Stanley Napier Raikes, Memoir on the Thurr and Parkur districts of Sind, Education Society's Press, Byculla, 1859. p. 83, Appendix B, Raikes met local Jains to compile recent history and consulted a Jain Yati Goorjee Kuntvujajee at Bodhesar, who had manuscripts describing the history of the temple. In 1716, the local chief Soda Sutojee moved the image from the temple to a fort. The image used to be buried underground at a secret location for safekeeping, and used to be taken out time to time with great elebration. Raikes write that thousands of monks and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people assembled for the fairs held in 1764, 1788, 1796, 1810, 1822 and 1824 for the idol's exhibition.Footloose: The lost idol of Gorecha ‚ÄîSalman Rashid, Daily Times, Pakistan, June 27, 2008, http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C06%5C27%5Cstory_27-6-2008_pg3_5 In AD 1832, the chief Soda Poonjajee, who was the only person who knew the location of the image, was captured by the ex-Ameers and died in captivity. The image was never seen again. The temple was later damaged in the battle between Colonel Tyrwhitt and a local Sodha chief, who had taken shelter at the temple. The temple was inspected the Archaeological Survey of India in 1879.Reports regarding the archaeological remains in Kurrachee, Hyderabad, and Shik√°rpur collectorates, in Sindh, with plans of tombs, Volume 8 of Arch√¶ological Survey of Western India, Archaeological Survey of India, Govt.

A local Bhil served as a guard. At that time there were still many Jain families in towns near Nagarparkar. During India's partition in 1947, the Jains left and the temple became inaccessible to the Jain community. Gori Temple Architecture: The Gori temple was constructed in the classical medieval style. The main structure (mula prasad) with a shikhara is surrounded by 52 subsidiary shrines (devakulikas), just like the Vimala Vasahi at Mt. Abu. It is termed Dvi-Saptati or Bavan Jinalaya by Nandalal Chunilal Somapura in the Sanskrit text Jina Prasad-Martanda.Shilpacharya Nandalal Chunilal Somapura, JinaPrasad-Martanda, Dakshkumar Nandalal Somapura, Palitana, 1993, p. 343-345 Like Vimala Vasahi, each of the 52 shrines are topped with a low dome. There is an underground chamber like some of the old temples in North India. The shrines are now empty. However the paintings in the 12-column ranga-mandap at the front gate are well preserved. An upper band shows people worshiping the Tirthankaras. Two of the bands below show processions with horses, elephants, planquins, chariots, indoor and outdoor scenes etc. and one of the bands has paintings of the Tirthankaras. Such paintings are now quite rare, since paintings of this period in India have generarally been painted over. ==Descendants of the builders== According to traditional accounts, compiled in early 20th century by Yati Ramlal Gani,Mahajan-Vamsh-Muktavali, Upadhayay Shri Ramalaji Gani, Pub. Shisyakshem Amar Balchandra, Bikaner, 1921, p. 21-24 the members of the Gothi clan of Oswals are the descendants of Megha Sa. They now live in various part of India.Mangilal Bhutoria, Itihas Ki Amarbel Oswal, Priyadarshi Prakashn 1992, p. 226 There are many remains of Jain temples in Nagarparkar region.

It is a large timber frame structure built in the early 20th century as the home of John C. Osgood, founder of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, in a simplified version of the Stick style. refers to a presumed \\"Tudor style\\". In 1971 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the first property in Pitkin County to be listed. It was later additionally listed as a contributing property to the Redstone Historic District. The castle was at the south end of the planned company town of Redstone, meant by Osgood to be an improvement over the usual housing and conditions in Western mining towns of the late 19th century. Just across the Crystal River were the coke ovens that processed coal mined higher up in the mountains and loaded onto a rail line. Miners and cokers in the town lived in cottages with electricity and running water, considered luxury items at the time. At his mansion, Osgood, at the time one of the country's richest men, entertained guests like Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller and King Leopold of Belgium, who joined him on hunts. The lush interior features European antique furniture and work by Gustav Stickley and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Its design was supposedly based on the ancestral home of Osgood's wife Alma. Redstone's prosperity ended within a decade, after Osgood lost control of the company, and he spent less time there. He returned to the property in the late 1920s to die. His wife tried to convert the house into a resort, but the Great Depression made that economically unviable; however, later owners were able to run it as a hotel into the 1990s. A recent owner who tried to refurbish was indicted in a financial fraud scheme, and the Internal Revenue Service sold it to compensate victims in its first-ever online auction of seized real property. It was sold again in 2016, and after a renovation, owners Steve and April Carver opened a ten-room boutique hotel in the castle in November 2018. It is also open for daily public tours. The 2006 film The Prestige used the castle as a location. ==Buildings and grounds== The mansion and its surviving outbuildings are located on approximately one mile (1.6 km) south of Redstone at the south end of Redstone Boulevard, which makes a loop to form the house's main driveway. It is located on high ground overlooking the Crystal River and State Highway 133 to the west, at an elevation of almost above sea level. On either side of the narrow valley are steep, undeveloped mountain slopes towards summits above . They rise into White River National Forest, with the eastern slopes part of the Maroon Bells‚ÄìSnowmass Wilderness between Redstone and Aspen. Exterior The main house sits at the east end of a cleared area that slopes up from the river, its west elevation visible from Highway 133. A walled terrace is attached to the southeast corner, and a cobbled courtyard on the east. The carriage path crossing it leads to the main entrance arch. It is an irregularly shaped three-story structure on a foundation of locally quarried rough-cut sandstone, irregularly exposed due to the slope, that also serves as the facade material for most of the first story. Lighter-toned stone serves as trim on some of the arched windows, keystones and quoins. Above the stone the house is faced in either wood shingles or stucco. Most windows are one-over-one double-hung sash windows. Those set in shingled faces are simply treated, while those in stone are trimmed in contrasting stone with radiating voussoirs. On the south and west facades are oriel windows supported by brackets. There are some decorative half-timbered friezes. The sections have variously peaked or hipped shingled roofs, pierced by occasional hip-roofed dormers and four tall stone chimneys. At the southwest corner is a three-story octagonal tower with a conical roof and stone buttresses, complemented by two peaked-roof towers on the eastern (rear) elevation. Interior Inside, the house's are divided among 42 rooms. The first floor is dominated by the English-style Great Hall, with ceilings and a large sandstone fireplace carved with Osgood's lion-based coat of arms and topped by a trophy elk mount. Three large brass globes designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, themselves decorated with lions, pineapples and angels, light the room. A special \\"peeping window\\" in the ceiling allowed Alma Osgood to see how female visitors were dressed so that she could adjust her own attire before receiving them. Persian carpets cover the floors in the hall and other first-floor rooms. Much of the furniture is antiques brought over from Europe by the Osgoods. The wooden paneling on the walls, made of English oak and Honduran mahogany, was designed by Gustav Stickley. The dining room reflects Russian tsarist tastes, with its hand-rubbed mahogany stained cherry red and covered with ruby velvet. The ceilings are finished in gold leaf. The library, overlooking the front lawn, has a Persian theme, evoking the private railcars tycoons like Osgood traveled in. Its walls and shelves are of mahogany, topped with green leather stamped in gold leaf. On the ceiling is a gold leaf border, hand-stenciled in a peacock motif. A French-styled music parlor, meant as the ladies' drawing room, has green silk damask walls, frescoed plaster ceiling and a Carrara marble fireplace topped with a diamond dust mirror. The corresponding gentleman's game room down in the basement has its original billiards and card tables. Upstairs are the bedrooms for the Osgoods and their guests. All feature bathrooms with oversized claw-foot porcelain bathtubs and sinks. Each has a fireplace of Italian marble or colored tile paneling. In the south tower is a two-room suite whose domed ceiling has been painted with birds and flowers. Outbuildings Several of the original outbuildings remain. The northern of the two gatehouses is located on Redstone Boulevard. It is architecturally similar to the main house, with a rusticated stone foundation and shingled siding. At the roofline's overhanging eaves are decorative vergeboards. The gabled roof is pierced by similarly gabled dormers. Closer to the house is a stable and carriage house. It, too, is similar to the main house, with a randomly laid stone foundation, shingled walls, towers and gabled dormers. Inside it has oak walls and a special glass case for the harnesses. It has been converted into a house. To the west, near the river, is a small open pagoda used for concerts in the summertime. alt=A black-and-white photograph of a balding man with his head bowed smoking a cigar, from the side ==History== The history of the castle has three periods: Osgood's early trips to the Crystal Valley and plans for the estate, the realization of that dream, and the years since his death in which it has been used as a hotel. 1882‚Äì1899: Osgood comes to the Crystal Valley A native of Brooklyn, New York, John C. Osgood first came to Colorado in 1882 to survey the state's coal resources for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The next year, he formed the Colorado Fuel Company to supply the railroads with coal mined elsewhere. He intended to go into the mining business himself, and had his eye on the lands of the remote Crystal Valley, recently opened up to European settlement through a treaty with the Ute people, the Native American tribe that had long lived in the area.Simmons and Whitacre, 5‚Äì9. During his surveys, Osgood had found that the valley's coal was of particularly high quality, low in ash and with few impurities. Coal that pure could not only be used as it was, it could be made into coke, useful in the production of steel. He began buying land in the valley, eventually owning thousands of acres. Most of it he eventually sold to his company, but he held onto a desirable portion for the hunting lodge he planned to build, with its surrounding game preserves.Simmons and Whitacre, 16‚Äì19. For both the estate and the mining to happen, the valley had to be made accessible. Various schemes to build toll roads and railroads were launched over the next ten years, and some construction was undertaken, but not enough financing was available to complete them. In 1892 Osgood's company merged with its rival, the Colorado Coal and Iron Company, to form Colorado Fuel and Iron (CFI), the largest such concern in the West. The combined firm had the assets to borrow against, but in the wake of the Panic of 1893 and its effect in Colorado, where many mining towns including nearby Aspen went into precipitous decline when the federal government stopped buying their silver, it was difficult to find banks willing to lend enough to pay for the railroad extension down the valley. 1899‚Äì1925: Estate years By 1899 the economy had improved. Osgood and CFI were able to build first the coke ovens, and then the company town of Redstone. Architect Theodore Boal designed small wooden cottages for the coke oven workers with running water and electricity, then luxury items rare in most Colorado mining towns. He adapted various contemporary architectural styles, particularly the Swiss chalet style, to the mountain setting.Simmons and Whitacre, 12. For himself, Osgood had reserved and fenced off , to which access was controlled by two gates. He had Boal design the mansion, which like the Redstone Inn to the north, then a dormitory for unmarried mine workers, used elements of the Tudor Revival style in addition to the Swiss Chalet forms. Originally it was intended to be a hunting lodge, as both Osgood and his Swedish-born wife, Alma, were avid outdoor sportspeople. It was completed in 1903 at a cost of $2.5 million ($ in modern dollars). Additional outbuildings no longer extant include the southern gatehouse, similar to its northern counterpart with a rusticated foundation of local sandstone, Tudor arches, overhanging eaves, gabled dormer windows and half-timber detailing. Next to it the large wrought iron gates were in a large stone arch with Osgood's crest carved into the center and a bell. Glaziers from New Jersey, then the center of the industry, were brought in to build a greenhouse, also no longer in existence. It consisted of an octagonal central pavilion and four radiating wings. Its southern entry used the same Tudor styling as the other buildings on the estate, with a half-timbered gabled entrance, decorative vergeboards and slanted lintels. It grew fresh flowers year-round, offsetting the valley's naturally short growing season. A stone reservoir held water both for the extensive lawns and fire suppression. It was complemented with a hose house storing the linen and rubber hoses needed for both purposes. Neither are extant. The stable was originally designed with both automobiles and horses in mind, reflecting the time of its construction. It also included a kennel for Osgood's hunting dogs. Horses were kept in a style almost as high as their owners, with paneled walls in their stalls and glass cases for their harnesses. John and Alma Osgood lived in the house at nearby Crystal River ranch while they waited for the house to be complete. They entertained many prominent guests there. J.P. Morgan, Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller and King Leopold II of Belgium came to enjoy the hunting on the private preserves, where elk and other game were abundant and rare bighorn sheep roamed (one of the stories told about the history of the house holds that Roosevelt took pleasure in shooting for game while standing on the mansion's front porch.) An extensive network of foot and bridle paths linked them with the house. After returning to the main house, guests shared dinner with their hosts, served on fine china with silver service, in the dining room. Following the meal, the women would retire to the music room with Alma while male guests would go downstairs to the game room and smoke cigars. A faint scent of cigar smoke can still be detected in the room. These parties became less common after 1903. Interests controlled by Rockefeller's family gained control of CFI. Osgood started the Victor American Fuel Company, which became CFI's chief competitor, but spent less time in the Crystal Valley and more in New York. In 1909 changes in the economy made the shipment of Crystal Valley coke unprofitable despite its quality, and the town and coke ovens were shut down. Almost overnight, Redstone was nearly abandoned. Osgood closed down the estate in 1913, leaving it to the care of the dozen or so who had remained in Redstone. After serving as a spokesperson for the mining companies during the labor disputes the following year which culminated in the Ludlow massacre, he did not return to the Crystal Valley until 1925. Suffering from terminal cancer, he worked to the extent he could with his third wife, Lucille, to redevelop the property, including what remained of the town, as a resort. 1926‚Äìpresent: Resort years In January 1926 Osgood died. His ashes were scattered over the valley. Lucille continued with the resort plans, but the onset of the Great Depression made that unworkable as too few people had the money to spare on trips to such a remote location. To make ends meet, she sold some of the major public buildings in the town, long out of use, and some of the estate's buildings like the southern gatehouse, for scrap. Some of these structures were moved‚Äîa part of the greenhouse still stands in Glenwood Springs. Finally, in the 1940s, she sold the house itself. The coal mines were reopened by another company in the early 1950s. This revival gave the mansion's new owner, Frank Kistler, who also owned the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, the impetus to tap into the house's potential as an all- season resort. He added a new wing to the building, and on the grounds built additional recreational facilities such as an enclosed swimming pool and tennis courts. The front lawn was converted into a golf course. The northern gatehouse was converted into a ski lodge after a ski lift was built. While some of the remaining cottages and estate outbuildings did become second homes, the resort plans were not successful as the four ski areas at nearby Aspen were attracting all the skiers and contributing to that city's renaissance in the second half of the 20th century. Kistler's death in 1960 also stalled the plans. In 1974 the mansion was purchased by Kenneth E Johnson a newspaper publisher from Grand Junction Colorado. He oversaw a major restoration of the buildings and for a time kept it as a family home. During this time tours of the building were open to the public. The mansion was later opened as a Bed and Breakfast and for special events such as weddings and conferences. In 1997 Johnson sold the property to a Canadian company. They soon defaulted on the mortgage for the property, and it was foreclosed and sold at auction. Leon Harte, one of the new owners, said he hoped to make it a \\"party palace\\" with rock concerts on the front lawn. In 2003 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seized it. Harte died two months later and the IRS announced that it would hold an online auction of the castle in March 2005, the first time it had ever disposed of a seized piece of real property that way. Bidders were required to put down a $100,000 deposit. By the early 21st century Redstone's population had grown to about 120, counting the remaining village and its environs. They were worried that a developer would buy it and demolish the castle, which they considered an important part of the community's history, to build expensive homes for the Aspen-area market. They were not opposed to doing that on some of the property, but a few years earlier, one developer had proposed a 1,500-unit condominium on the site and the castle's demolition. The IRS allayed their concerns by putting in easements to protect about around the castle and carriage house. Interest in the auction was high. The page advertising the property received over 50,000 hits in the weeks leading up to it. Interest in bidding came from overseas as well as domestically. The winning bidder, Ralli Dimitrius, a developer who divided his time between Aspen and Southern California, paid $4 million. He did not disclose his identity as the buyer for almost a week. A dejected fellow bidder who felt the IRS had not given prospective buyers enough time to do due diligence offered him an additional million to sell it to her, but he refused. Dimitrius planned to do extensive restoration on the property. In 2007, he reopened it for tours, bringing much-desired tourist traffic to Redstone. Four years later, the tours had proven so successful that they were expanded to every day rather than just weekends. In the meantime, Dimitrius restored the plumbing and heating, relined the chimneys, put in a new sprinkler system and had the roofs and gutters replaced and the exterior stucco repaired. As of 2011, he was awaiting approval from Pitkin County for a new sewage treatment system, needed if any sort of expanded resort operations were to resume or begin. In September 2016, it was once again listed for auction, by Sotheby's. Two months later, it was sold to the owners of The Hotel Denver in Glenwood Springs who are continuing the historic tours and have opened up a ten-room, boutique hotel in the castle. ==See also== *List of castles in the United States *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pitkin County, Colorado ==References *Redstone Castle website Category:Castles in Colorado Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Colorado Category:Houses completed in 1903 Category:Redstone, Colorado Category:Historic district contributing properties in Colorado Category:Houses in Pitkin County, Colorado Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pitkin County, Colorado Category:1903 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Redstone Castle"},{"id":"35278996","text":"Gaetano Adinolfi is a former Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe (1978-1993).The Parliamentary Assembly: practice and procedure, Council of Europe, 2008, He was elected in 1978 and re-elected in 1983 and 1988.

After graduating from Trisakti in 1979, she became a lecturer of medicine at Prof. Moestopo University in Jakarta. Mira's most successful book, Di Sini Cinta Pertama Kali Bersemi (Here Love First Blossomed), was published in 1980. She continues to produce works, drawing from writers such as Nh. Dini, Agatha Christie, Y. B. Mangunwijaya and Harold Robbins for inspiration. Mira has been cited as an early inspiration for another ethnic Chinese Indonesian female writer, Clara Ng. ==Pseudonym== The pen name Mira W., which obscures the Chinese-Indonesian names Widjaja and Wong, has been described by literary critic Pamela Allen as hiding Mira's Chinese heritage to better match Indonesian culture. Another writer said to use a pseudonym in such a manner is Marga T. This is due in part to illwill towards Chinese Indonesians during Suharto's New Order regime. ==Works and adaptations== , Mira has published over 40 novels, many of which have been cinematized, including Di Sini Cinta Pertama Kali Bersemi, Ketika Cinta Harus Memilih (When Love Must Choose) and Permainan Bulan Desember (Games in December). In total she has contributed the story to twenty-three films, making her debut as screenwriter in 1973's Jauh di Mata, directed by her brother Willy. ==Themes== Mira's main characters are always women, and the novels often show women suffering at the hands of men, as well as from their own internal conflicts. Her works also deal with gender roles and stereotypes. ==References * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Indonesian women writers Category:Indonesian Cantonese people Category:Indonesian women novelists Category:Indonesian screenwriters Category:People from Jakarta Category:Trisakti University alumni ","title":"Mira W."},{"id":"35279107","text":"The Play-offs of the 1996 Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone Group II were the final stages of the Group II Zonal Competition involving teams from Asia and Oceania.

The club has British roots, so the first clubs in London had been founded as social institutions so therefore they were usually the place where gentlemen of the high classes met. Palermo played in Primera Divisi√≥n, the first division of Argentina, during the 1920s, and then disaffiliated when football became professional in the country. Some relevant players from the institution are Gonzalo Higua√≠n\\"Higua√≠n, el que hac√≠a 100 goles por torneo\\", Diario Perfil, 2010-06-19 and Leandro Graci√°n, who played for Palermo in children divisions. Other sports practised at the club are volleyball, archery, roller skate and martial arts.Clubes del Barrio at Palermo Activo website (archive link) ==History== Social context At the beginning of the 20th century there was a big British community in Argentina, much of them with commercial interests in the area such as railway lines. The Welsh community mostly established in the city of Rawson, Chubut, at the South of Argentine. The name of that city pays tribute to Guillermo Rawson, the Governor who encouraged Welsh people to establish there.\\"Valle del Chubut, historia y cultura\\" on Andes Celtig website The Irish settled in Exaltaci√≥n de la Cruz Partido, in the north of Buenos Aires Province, between 1830 and 1840. The main activity of the Irish Immigrants was the agriculture (that is still a huge rural zone) and its legacy persist in cities such as Gaynor or Dugan, named honoring some relevant Irish citizens.Origen del Partido de Exaltaci√≥n de la Cruz By 1838, the Scottish community in Buenos Aires was an important part of the population,\\"Observatorio de Colectividades\\", Government of Buenos Aires website so they decided to create the St. Andrew's Scots School to educate their children in their language.St. Andrew's Scot School of Buenos Aires ‚Äì History British people started to found their own social institutions, which did not allow non-British members at the beginning of their existence. Some of the clubs with this rule were Buenos Aires Cricket & Rugby Club and Quilmes Athletic Club, although those institutions would finally accept Argentine people as its members as years went by. During the Industrial Revolution England found numerous commercial opportunities in Argentina, where the British-owned companies built most of the railway lines and stations, operating them until their nationalization in 1940 when Juan Per√≥n was president. Therefore, a big group of British engineers and managers moved to Argentina during the construction of those railway lines. It is presumed that those railway workers brought football to Argentina. Foundation and competition Clubhouse as seen in 1922 The club was founded as \\"Club Atl√©tico Palermo\\" on 21 July 1914, as a result of a merge with Club General Soler, from which Palermo adopted its colors (red with blue borders) for the first jersey uniform.De coraz√≥n amateur on Buenos Aires, Ciudad de Noticias, 19 May 2017 Arturo Sosa, the chemist of the neighborhood, was elected as president of the club. Palermo established its headquarters in Paraguay street, although it later moved to Juan B. Justo avenue until 1927, when the club returned to its original location. Team of Palermo in 1925 In 1914 Palermo affiliated to the Argentine Football Association\\"Nuevos clubes afiliados\\", Memoria y Balance 1919‚Äì21, page 16 ‚Äì Argentine Football Association Library\\"Clubes afiliados\\", Memoria y Balance 1922, page 6 playing at Divisi√≥n Intermedia, the second level by then. Its first field was on the corner of Soler and Humboldt streets of Buenos Aires, then moving to Mendoza and Freire in Belgrano neighborhood. The club has also another field in Villa Lynch, Tres de Febrero Partido of Greater Buenos Aires. In 1919 Palermo was near to promote to Primera Divisi√≥n although the team was defeated by Banfield 1‚Äì0. Nevertheless, the club took part in the 1920 tournament although Palermo did not play all the games, being disaffiliated that same season along with Lan√∫s and Sportivo Almagro.Argentina 1920 championship ‚Äì RSSSF Palermo returned to Primera in 1923 but playing at the rival league, Asociaci√≥n Amateurs de Football (AAm).

For most of the last century the Arboretum was a nursery that supplied mainly coniferous plants for the reforestation of the entire Sierra de Hu√©tor, which had had its original vegetation completely destroyed by over-exploitation for forestry and livestock raising. The Arboretum was opened to the public in 2003 after the grounds, walking trails and information panels of the plants found here were established.

Inspired by the work of abolitionists and African-American Sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, his dissertation examined the interconnection between race and democracy. From his dissertation, he published his book The Abolition of White Democracy (2004, University of Minnesota Press).

The date of both 2012 Final matches, as in all the recent years, is set so that it avoids clashes with Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina fixtures. Both matches took on Wednesday, between two rounds of the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The current holders, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, defended their title and brought home the fifth cup title it their history. Winning this cup, they also completed the double, as they already won the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, their second double in history and the first double any team won since the unification of the Premier league in 2002. ==Route to the Final== ≈Ωeljezniƒçar Since all clubs started the competition from round of 32, so did ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, the defending champions, also. Their first opponent was Leotar. In single fixture game on Grbavica stadium, they secured their position in the next round. Zdravko ≈†araba made a foul on Vernes Selimoviƒá in the penalty area, which Zajko Zeba pointed for 1‚Äì0 in the 43-minute. Seconds before the halftime, ≈Ωeljezniƒçars goalkeeper, Elvis Kariƒá, boxed the ball to avoid danger, but outside the 16 meter box, earning a direct red card. His place was taken over by the veteran Adnan Gu≈°o, with the captain, Mirsad Be≈°lija, leaving the field as a substitute. The final score was set by Muamer Svraka, who came in the game just two minutes before that, in the 73-minute for 2‚Äì0. In round of 16, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar played against their city rival, Olimpic. From this round on, two- legged fixtures were played. In the first-leg, played on Grbavica stadium, the first goal fell in the 39-minute, after a free kick from Mirsad Be≈°lija was scored with a header from Eldin Adiloviƒá. The second goal was assisted by Zajko Zeba, once more from a free kick, which Jadranko Bogiƒçeviƒá scored, and once again with a header, in 54-minute. The last goal, for a comfortable 3‚Äì0 win before the rematch, was scored by Patrick Nyema Gerhardt in the 78-minute also with a header. The rematch was played three weeks later, on Otoka stadium. The spectators waited until the 67-minute for the first goal when Sulejman Smajiƒá found Zajko Zeba who scored for 0‚Äì1. Until the end of the game, Olimpic made the equalizer in 78-minute over Admir Ra≈°ƒçiƒá ending the black statistic of Olimpic in matches against ≈Ωeljezniƒçar since this was the first match they didn't lost against them.

Eldin Adiloviƒá, striker who came the last summer exactly from ƒåelik, scored very early for 1‚Äì0 against his former club, in the 16-minute. In the second half, ƒåelik went in offensive, but in the midst of his attacks, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar scored for the second goal. This time it was Vernes Selimoviƒá who scored for the final 2‚Äì0 in 64-minute. In the rematch played in Zenica, on Bilino Polje stadium, a goalless match was seen, mostly thanks to the bad pitch left after a qualifying match of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Luxembourg in bad weather and another game in the playoff against Portugal made it just worse. ƒåelik had more of the game, with ≈Ωeljezniƒçar endangering their goal from time to time but none of teams had the concentration for a goal. New record snowfalls in many regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina delayed the original date for first-leg of the semi-finals by a week. ≈Ωeljezniƒçar met Borac, a team they faced also in the last two season of this competition (once in final). The first match, played on Grbavica, was an unattractive one, with the pitch still in bad shape because of the massive snow. Jadranko Bogiƒçeviƒá was sent off after 75 minutes because of a second yellow card, but ≈Ωeljezniƒçar still managed to win with a late goal by Zajko Zeba in the 87th minute when Marijan Antoloviƒá reacted badly. The second-leg was played three weeks later on City Stadium of Banja Luka. The game started very offensive from both side, but the first goal came in the last minute of the first half after a disputable foul over Muamer Svraka. Zajko Zeba managed to score from the free- kick 17 meters away from the goal for 0‚Äì1 for ≈Ωeljezniƒçar. The game didn't reached the end of the second half, as the assistant referee was hit in 65-minute by a solid object from the east stand were the ultras fan of Borac are located. While the referee received medical care, the delegate first decided to empty the east stand but then aborted the match. The day after the match, the disciplinary and contest commission decided to award ≈Ωeljezniƒçar with a 0‚Äì3 win and punished Borac with a ‚Ç¨5,000 fine and the next six home matches without spectators. ≈†iroki Brijeg In the single fixture round of 32, ≈†iroki Brijeg faced on Pecara stadium, their home venue, Kozara. Kozara proved to be not a challenge for ≈†iroki Brijeg, as they won the match with 3‚Äì0. The first goal was scored by Jure Ivankoviƒá in 18-minute, with Hrvoje Mi≈°iƒá raising to 2‚Äì0 in 35-minute.

In the second halftime, ≈†iroki Brijeg succeeded to turn over the result with two goals of Varea. The first goal was scored in 70-minute while the second goal came just seven minutes later. In the rematch played in ≈†iroki Brijeg, Slavija once more succumbed to ≈†iroki Brijeg. Just as the match started, ≈†iroki Brijeg got in lead. In the second minute of the game Ivica D≈æidiƒá scored for the 1‚Äì0. Already in eight-minute it was 2‚Äì0, the scorer was Dalibor ≈†iliƒá. Till the end of the first-half, ≈†iroki Brijeg scored two more goals, first in 35-minute over Wagner Santos Lago and four-minute later over Juan Manuel Varea. Slavija lowered to 4‚Äì1 in 57-minute with a goal from Marko Peri≈°iƒá and then seven minutes later on 4‚Äì2 over Nemanja ≈†e≈°lija. In the quarter-finals, ≈†iroki got as opponent a team from the second league tier, Kraji≈°nik. The first match played before full stadium in Velika Kladu≈°a ended without a winner. Kraji≈°nik got in lead in 38-minute over ≈†aban Pehilj, ≈Ωeljezniƒçars footballer on loan, but Hrvoje Mi≈°iƒá scored the equalizer for ≈†iroki Brijeg in 86-minute of the game for the final 1‚Äì1. The rematch played three weeks later on Pecara stadium ended in a goalless tie and ≈†iroki Brijeg advanced further because of the away goal. In the last hurdle before the final, ≈†iroki Brijeg faced Vele≈æ. The first leg on Pecara stadium ended with a 1‚Äì0 win. Mateo Roskam was successful in 83-minute with a header against former ≈†iroki Brijeg goalkeeper Dejan Bandoviƒá. Despite many chances Vele≈æ created, they were not able to score a goal against Luka Bilobrk and the defense of ≈†iroki Brijeg. The second-leg on Vrapƒçiƒái stadium showed that ≈†iroki Brijeg is the better of the two, once more. This time ≈†iroki Brijeg was the dominant one throughout the match but still won the rematch with only a one-goal margin. Mario Kvesiƒá scored for 0‚Äì1 in the 69-minute, sealing the fate of Vele≈æ and securing his team the final of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup for the fourth time. ==Pre-match== This final marked the eight appearance in final of Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup for ≈Ωeljezniƒçar and ninth final in domestic cups, since they were once in final of Yugoslav Cup. They had won the cup four times (in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2011) and have been beaten in 4 occasions (in 1981, 1997, 2002 and 2010). On the other side, this will be the fourth final for ≈†iroki Brijeg and they won it once (in 2007), with two finals lost (in 2005 and 2006). This is the first time these two clubs meat each other in final of this competition, while it is the fifth overall encounter in this competition (they met each other before three times in semi-finals and once in quarter-finals). On 10 April 2012, a draw to decide who will be the first host was held with ≈Ωeljezniƒçar hosting the first-leg on 25 April and ≈†iroki Brijeg the rematch three weeks later on 17 May, with both matches aired on BHT1. There were some speculations that the first leg will be postponed for 26 April to avoid clashes with the semifinal of the Champions League, but in the end, the first leg remained on the same date with the kick off at 18:30. Unlike the two last finals, in which ≈Ωeljezniƒçar also played, this time the ticket price wasn't raised but rather remained the same as the prices for the regular tickets for the league matches, which is ‚Ç¨2,5 for the south stand (the stand were The Maniacs are), ‚Ç¨4 for the north stand and ‚Ç¨5 for the west stand. Also, organized attendance of away fans are not allowed as the ban on organized arriving of away fans is on power since October 2011 and was still not lifted by the Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The kick off for the second leg was set at 20:00, on Wednesday 16 May. Just like in the first leg, no organized attendance of away fans was allowed. Two days before the match, on 14 May, ≈Ωeljezniƒçars players went to Hercegovina, Meƒëugorje, where they had their last trainings. They also wanted to accommodate to the surrounding and weather, but also to be close to the city of ≈†iroki Brijeg. They decided to leave Sarajevo earlier that day then planned because of sudden unseasonal snowfall. Before the match, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar was in a more than a 3-year unbeaten streak in national cup, with the last lost match dating to 24 September 2008 against Zvijezda in the first round of 2008‚Äì09 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup. Since then, they played 26 matched in the national cup, winning in 16 of those matches and drawing 10, with a goal difference of 45 to 8. They won two of the last three national cups, since they lost the final in 2009‚Äì10 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup to Borac on an aggregate score of 3:3 after two draw matches. Borac won the cup because of more scored away goals. ==Matches== Both team managers said that in the final the two best clubs of the season are clashing and that these are probably the most important matches of the season for both clubs since the teams almost already secured a place in European competition at that moment. They also said that the biggest motive will be to gain a trophy and that only small differences and luck will decide the winner. None of the sides had bigger problems with bookings or injuries for the first leg. Nevertheless, manager of ≈†iroki Brijeg, Marijan Bloudek, admitted that ≈Ωeljezniƒçar is the better side at the moment, with the many records and the league position proving that, but with his team very close behind and with realistic chances to win. Before the second leg, the atmosphere in ≈†iroki Brijeg was intense, since if their team wins, this would be the first trophy in five years. ≈†kripari, the ultras fan of the team, made some announcements before the match to bring more people to the stadium. Many managers and sport workers came to the final, not only from Bosnia and Herzegovina but also from the region. Both teams had much respect for the opponent and said for them that they are, along with them, the best team in the league this year and that only small differences and luck will decide the winner, but again that their team will have more reasons to be happy at the end of the match, which could have been seen in the comment the managers given to the press. While ≈†iroki Brijeg didn't have any problems with suspended or injured players, Patrick Nyema Gerhardt, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar's standard player, would miss the game because of booking.

It was designed by British sculptor Sydney March, of the March family of artists. == Location == The Bromley War Memorial is located on Martin's Hill near the intersection of Glassmill Lane and Church Road in Bromley, Greater London, England. The memorial is set within a garden and surrounded by iron railings. It is positioned inside the entrance to Martin's Hill, Bromley's first ornamental park. Martin's Hill was ostensibly named after a baker who once resided there. For years, the residents of Bromley promenaded on the hill. In the latter half of the 1800s, Martin's Hill had a commanding view of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London. Bromley itself took its name from the broom, a yellow-flowered shrub, that once grew abundantly in the area. In the 1800s, Martin's Hill was one of the last places that still had flowering broom. In 1878, the site was acquired by the Bromley Council; trees and flower beds were planted, and it became an ornamental park. The National Grid Reference for the Bromley War Memorial is TQ 39979 69238. == Design == The monument includes a square obelisk constructed of Portland stone, a limestone quarried on the Isle of Portland in the English Channel. It is positioned on a base with three steps. The memorial features three bronze figures adjacent to the lower portion of the obelisk. On the fourth side of the obelisk, the back of the monument, there is a bronze cartouche. In addition, there are bronze plaques with the names of the fallen on all four sides of the base. The statues include a winged Victory in the centre, with a laurel wreath. That statue is flanked by two additional bronze figures, one of Liberty with a torch and the other of Peace with flowers of remembrance. The monument records the names of 769 soldiers from the area who died in World War I. It also lists the names of 476 soldiers and civilians who were killed during World War II. The memorial was completed by the sculptor in 1922. == Dedications == The Bromley War Memorial was unveiled on 29 October 1922, by Lord Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne, G.C.B., K.C.M.G. (1861‚Äì1929). Sir Henry Horne was a general during World War I. The monument was dedicated by the Bishop of Rochester, John Reginald Harmer D.D. (1857‚Äì1944), an Anglican bishop. Before his service in Rochester, Kent, Harmer served as Bishop of Adelaide. The rededication purportedly took place on 6 November 1949, Remembrance Sunday. However, Remembrance Sunday falls on the second Sunday in November, the Sunday closest to Armistice Day (11 November). The dedication of the plaques for the fallen of World War II was performed by the Vicar of Bromley, the Rev. W. H. Murray-Walton. In his brief address, he stated \\"This memorial, in front of which we now stand, was dedicated in memory of those who laid down their lives in the First World War. Since 1939, however, it has also been a silent symbol of remembrance of those who were killed in the last war.\\" Those present included the mayor, Alderman B. J. Finnie, and other council members, as well as the Parliament member for Bromley, Harold Macmillan. == National Heritage List for England == The Bromley War Memorial was listed on the National Heritage List for England on 14 December 1995. The National Heritage List is the official database for all national heritage assets in England. It is managed by English Heritage, the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England. The war memorial's English Heritage list entry number is 1116976. Its English Heritage building ID number and Images of England number is 442525. Images of England is a photographic library of the country's listed structures, as of the turn of the 21st century. The Bromley War Memorial is listed as a Grade II* structure. Grade II* structures are particularly important structures \\"of more than special interest.\\" Only 5.5% of listed structures are Grade II*. The majority are Grade II. == Sculptor == Bromley War Memorial on Martin's Hill The Bromley War Memorial was designed and sculpted by British artist Sydney March. The son of George and Elizabeth March, he was born in 1876 in Stoneferry, a suburb of Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. He was the second of nine children, eight of whom became artists. As a child, Sydney March worked as a monumental sculptor's apprentice. Later, he attended the Royal Academy Schools, where he won first prize in 1900. March exhibited thirteen times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts between 1906 and 1932. His family established studios at their home of Goddendene in Farnborough, Kent in 1902. Sydney March was a prolific artist whose primary focus was war memorials, as well as sculptures of British royalty and other contemporary figures. He and his siblings completed the National War Memorial of Canada after the 1930 death of their brother, sculptor Vernon March. Other monuments for which he is renowned include the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial in Northern Ireland, the United Empire Loyalist Monument in Canada, and the Lancaster Monument in England. Smaller-scale pieces include the portrait busts of King Edward VII and Cecil John Rhodes, both in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Sydney March died in 1968 at age 92. His ashes were interred in the family plot at Saint Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough. In 1922, Sydney had sculpted the bronze angel monument that marks the March plot.

It runs from west to east, parallel to the east bank of the Mississippi River, from Prairieville to LaPlace. It spans a total of . Throughout its run, LA 44 is known as North/South Burnside Avenue, River Road, West/East Jefferson Highway, West 5th Street, and Main Street. ==Route description== From the west, LA 44 begins at an intersection with LA 42 (Oak Grove-Port Vincent Highway) in Prairieville. The highway travels south along North Burnside Avenue into Gonzales where it intersects with US 61 (North Airline Highway). Passing through downtown Gonzales, LA 44 has a brief concurrency with LA 429. After several blocks, the local name changes to South Burnside Avenue at an intersection with LA 3038 (East Cornerview Street), and LA 429 splits off to the west along West Cornerview Street. Leaving Gonzales, LA 44 continues south and intersects with I-10. After three miles, LA 44 intersects with LA 22 as that highway runs between Sorrento and Darrow. A mile later, LA 44 reaches the east bank of the Mississippi River at an intersection with LA 942 at Burnside. Here, the route turns onto the River Road and soon crosses from Ascension Parish into St. James Parish. It then passes under and connects with the Sunshine Bridge, part of LA 70 to Donaldsonville. Continuing downriver, LA 44 begins to follow a generally eastward direction passing through the communities of Convent, Paulina, Lutcher, and Gramercy. Jefferson Highway, the local name in use beginning in Lutcher, is a vestige of the road being part of that historic auto trail in the 1910s and 1920s. On the east side of Gramercy, LA 44 passes under and connects with a second Mississippi River crossing known as the Gramercy Bridge, part of LA 3213, just before entering St. John the Baptist Parish. Continuing along the Mississippi River, LA 44 runs parallel to US 61 (Airline Highway) and passes through the communities of Mt. Airy, Garyville, Lions, and Reserve. LA 44 then enters LaPlace, turning away from the river at an intersection with LA 636 onto West 5th Street. Almost two miles later, LA 44 turns northeast onto Main Street at LA 628. The route ends at US 61 (West/East Airline Highway) near the southern terminus of US 51. LA 44 is an undivided, two-lane highway from LA 42 to LA 621 in Gonzales, where it widens into an undivided, four-lane highway. At LA 30, LA 44 becomes a divided four- lane highway to just south of I-10, where it reverts to an undivided, two-lane highway for the remainder of its route to LaPlace. ==History== The portion of LA 44 running along the Mississippi River was once part of the Jefferson Highway auto trail designated in 1916 and the main traffic route between New Orleans and Baton Rouge prior to the construction of the Airline Highway in the 1930s. In 1921, it became part of State Route 1 in the pre-1955 Louisiana highway system and the original alignment of US 61 in 1926. US 61 also followed the Gonzales-Burnside section of LA 44 (pre-1955 State Route 88) briefly before being completely removed from the route following the opening of the Airline Highway in 1933. ==Major intersectionsReferences *LADOTD Map of Numbered Highways *Louisiana State Highway Log 0044 044 Category:Transportation in Ascension Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in St. James Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Louisiana Highway 44"},{"id":"35279798","text":"Giovanni Campusano (born 11 January 1993) is a Chilean footballer who currently plays for Primera B de Chile club √ëublense as an attacking midfielder. ==Career== Club career Campusano started his football career at the local professional of his city Deportes La Serena, joining to the youth ranks in 2007, aged 14.

Most consist of rails that are about wide, and long. The rails are inserted into fixed standards, usually made in an \\"X\\" shape, that commonly are designed to be placed at one of three preset heights ranging from a few inches off the ground to a maximum of about . However, in informal terminology, even ground rails without standards are sometimes called \\"cavaletti.\\" Modern designs can be made from various types of molded plastic and PVC pipe as well as wood. They can be used both for ground training with the handler working a horse on a longe line or at liberty, or while a rider is mounted on the horse. Cavaletti are used by practitioners of both English riding and western riding. Similar obstacles of lighter weight materials are used with dogs in dog agility and canine physical therapy. Cavaletti were invented by Federico Caprilli and designed to help a horse improve its balance, adjust its length of stride, and to loosen and strengthen its muscles. They are often used in sets of at least four to six placed in a row, but have nearly unlimited ways they can be configured. Used at their lowest placement as ground rails or at a level no more than about high, they can be set to encourage a proper length of stride. By being set closer or farther apart than a horse's natural stride, they encourage lengthening or shortening of the stride. Used as a \\"gymnastic\\" in conjunction with other horse jumping obstacles in a training ring, they help teach the horse how to approach a fence at the proper rate of speed and length of stride. Set at higher settings, they become small jumps to introduce young horses or beginning riders to jumping. Some designs can safely be stacked, allowing fences up to about .

The boots are made of twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on the inside and with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort.

The Doctrine of foreign equivalents guideline serves this purpose. Under the doctrine of \\"foreign equivalents,\\" a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark. In applying the doctrine, the courts consistently refer to two policy rationales.Sujata Chaudhri Trademark Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents Cowan, Liebowitz & Latman pg 1 The first rationale, \\"the doctrine serves the interests of domestic competition\\": > \\"Because of the diversity of the population of the United States, coupled > with temporary visitors, all of whom are part of the United States > marketplace, commerce in the United States utilizes innumerable foreign > languages.

Guadalajara, Inc., 210 F.3d 439 (5th Cir. 2000) However, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (\\"TMEP\\") states that the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is \\"whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent\\".Guidance on when to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents. Examination Guide 1-08 United States Patent and Trademark Office April 23, 2008 The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an \\"ordinary American purchaser\\" refers to the \\"significant portion of consumers\\" who speak both English and the relevant foreign language.

Similarly, a California court has held that the \\"genericness\\" of an English-language term in an English-speaking foreign country \\"was not determinative of the alleged genericness of that term in the United States.\\" -- Rest Elizabeth J.

The genericity argument was invoked for Ugg boots and was rejected by a U.S. district court which cited the following cases in support. In Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co., the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase \\"L.A. beer\\" in Australia for low-alcohol beer.Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co., 750 F.2d 631, 641-42 (8th Cir. 1984). The court ruled that \\"a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another\\" and that genericity in Australia was irrelevant.Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co. B92 In Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc., the court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term \\"Greengrocer\\" in most English speaking countries for a retailer of fruit. The court rejected the argument on the grounds that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States:Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co. C42 \\"The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative.\\" Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc., 205 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1075 (E.D. Cal. 1979). In another case, the court stated that while a term may be generic in another country, if \\"it is not so recognized in this country [the U.S.]... the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States.\\" and thus remains eligible for registration as a trademark in the United States.Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten, 545 F. Supp. 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) As the doctrine is a guideline rather than a rule, it has been criticized with commentators noting that United States courts are often contradictory and inconsistent in their application of the doctrine, and that it provides little guidance to owners when choosing their marks or to courts when assessing protectability or likelihood of mark confusion. It has been suggested by the International Trademark Association that the doctrine be abolished and replaced with one that applies equally to all foreign words, regardless of whether they are from a foreign language or an English language, and that they take into account that country's trademark laws.

Deckers has registered \\"ugg\\" as a trademark in over 130 countries. The UGG trademark has been the subject of dispute in several countries. The trademark for \\"Ugh-Boots\\" has been removed from the trademark registry in Australia for non-use. Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG (written in capital letters) is a registered trademark of Deckers Outdoor Corporation. In 1971, an Australian surfer, Shane Steadman, registered the name \\"UGH-BOOTS\\" as a trademark in Australia and began selling sheepskin boots under that name. In 1982 he registered the name \\"UGH\\" and a logo containing a stylised Sun with the words \\"UGG AUSTRALIA\\". In 1979, Brian Smith, another Australian surfer, applied to be the United States distributor for Country Leather, a Western Australian manufacturer of ugg boots, and began selling their Australian-made boots in New York and to surfers in California. In 1987 he set up Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1995 purchased the trademarks from Steadman. In 1996 he sold his interest to Deckers and in 1999 Deckers registered the trademarks for \\"UGG\\" in the US and 25 foreign countries.Fink, Karl V.; Johnson, Carolyn M.; Miranda, David P. (February 5, 2004), \\"UGG Holdings, Inc. and Deckers Outdoor Corporation v. Paul Barclay d/b/a Australian Made Goods\\", National Arbitration Forum, retrieved August 25, 2010UGG is a brand. Fact and Fiction. Deckers Outdoor Corporation Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out cease and desist letters to Australian manufacturers who were using the name ugg for their boots but otherwise took little action. In the early 2000s, demand for ugg boots was soaring, partly as a result of US$8 million spent on marketing by Deckers, but also due to several celebrity endorsements. For the nine months to September 2004, UGG boots sales totaled $39.2 million, an increase of 180% over the previous year. Plans were also in place to expand the UGG brand to cover hats, scarves and gloves.Press Release Deckers October 24, 2004 With the continuing rise in popularity, Deckers now began a serious effort to halt the use of the name \\"ugg\\" by other manufacturers. Deckers' law firm, Middletons of Melbourne, sent cease and desist letters to a number of Australian and American manufacturers who were selling uggs over the Internet, preventing them from selling uggs on eBay or from using the word in their domain names or registered business names. Uggs-N-Rugs factory in Kenwick, Western Australia The manufacture of ugg boots in Australia was primarily a cottage industry. Individually lacking the resources to fight Deckers, 20 Australian manufacturers formed the Australian Sheepskin Association to fight the corporation's claim, arguing that \\"ugg\\" is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots.Arnold, James Aussie boot battle takes an Uggly turn BBC News February 19, 2004Taking On The Big Guys Is Never an Easy Task Australian Institute of Management April 2005 They further argued that Australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades, including exporting them to the US. One of these manufacturers, Perth's Uggs-N-Rugs, who had been manufacturing uggs since 1978 and selling them online since 1996, appealed to Australian trademark regulators, IP Australia. The officer who heard the case stated that the \\"evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods.\\" In 2006 Uggs-N-Rugs won the right to use the term UGG BOOT/S and variations such as UGH BOOT/S. The case was the subject of a 2006 television documentary, The Good, The Bad and The Ugg Boot. Counsel for Uggs-N-Rugs was David Stewart instructed by Wrays: Counsel for Deckers was Christian Dimitriadis instructed by Ashurst. Deckers retained the rights to their UGG logo as trade mark protection only applies for the way the mark appears in its entirety and not for the words it contains. The name Ugg/UGG was determined to be generic after the Registrar of Trade Marks found that registration did not confer \\"rights in the generic term, or terms, from which it is derived\\" and that the identity of the various trade marks \\"derive from the hyphenated nature of the expression.\\" Therefore, UGH boots, UG boots and UGG boots (\\"or other variations\\") without hyphens are all generic terms in Australia.Decision of the delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks with reasons. January 16, 2006 pg 10 - 11 IP Australia also ruled that the trademark \\"UGH-boots\\" (with hyphen) should be removed from the trademark register for non-use as Deckers had only been using the UGG logo, not the UGH marks. Deckers initially declined to pay Uggs-N-Rugs court costs as required by the 2006 ruling. Following the publication of a Wall Street Journal article which referred to the oversight, Deckers paid the costs in September 2010. The ruling only applies in Australia and Deckers still owns the trademarks in other jurisdictions such as the US, China, Japan and the European Union. In 1998, Deckers demanded that the American company Koolaburra cease infringing the UGG trademark. Koolaburra replied that they did not use the name \\"UGG\\" or \\"UGH\\" and that the only mark they used was \\"Ug\\". Deckers sent a further \\"cease and desist\\" letter in 2001 and another in 2003 but Koolaburra declined to stop using the name \\"Ug\\" and in 2004, Deckers filed a case against Koolaburra in the California federal court alleging (1) trademark infringement, (2) false designation of origin (Koolaburra labelled their boots \\"Australian Ug Boots\\"), (3) trademark dilution, (4) cybersquatting, (5) unfair competition, (6) trade disparagement, (7) unjust enrichment and (8) breach of contract (Deckers claimed that in 1998 Koolaburra had agreed to stop using the name Ug). Koolaburra in turn challenged that the name UGG was generic and not entitled to trademark protection. As the UGG mark was registered, Deckers was entitled to the assumption that it was not generic, thus the burden of proof rested with Koolaburra. In support, Koolaburra provided the testimony of America's National Surfing Team coach Peter Townend and Nordstrom's footwear buyer Heather Kolkey. These declarations were accepted by the court as anecdotal. Additionally, Koolaburra provided three instances of the generic usage of Ugg in American magazines, however the court pointed out that the most recent was dated 1980. Koolaburra also quoted the New York City published Oxford English Dictionary definition of \\"Ugg\\"; however, this was rejected after Deckers petitioned the Dictionary to change the definition of \\"Ugg\\" from \\"a kind of soft sheepskin boot\\" to a definition that included UGG's trademark, which the OED agreed to do.Behind the Brand: The Golden Fleece Wall Street Journal September 9, 2010. Koolaburra then argued that the UGG trademark was invalid as Brian Smith had fraudulently registered the name by giving false representations that the term was not generic, arguing that \\"as an Australian citizen, Smith knew of the fact that the term Ugg was a generic term\\". This was rejected by the court as fraud requires an applicant to \\"knowingly\\" make the false representations, ruling that such belief was subjective, and finding that even if Smith knew the term was generic in Australia, he may have \\"honestly held [a] good faith belief\\" that it was not generic in the United States. Deckers countered through submitting declarations from four professionals in the footwear industry who stated that \\"UGG\\" is widely recognized in the industry as a brand name, not a generic term and provided the court with survey evidence supporting that consumers in the US consider UGG to be a brand name; among women aged 18 to 45 who had purchased footwear valued over $100 in the last 12 months, 58% believed UGG was a brand name while only 11% thought it generic. Koolaburra then argued that the term was generic under the doctrine of \\"foreign equivalents\\" (Under U.S. law, a term used in another country that is considered generic in that country cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark). This was rejected as the doctrine only applied to terms in a foreign language. In February 2005, the court ruled for Deckers on their claims of \\"trademark infringement\\" and \\"unfair competition\\", finding that a consumer would likely be confused with the similarity in \\"appearance, sight and sound\\" between \\"Ug\\" and UGG\\" as the parties were marketing in direct competition with identical products. However, the court declined to rule on the validity of trademarks in Australia as it was considered inappropriate to interfere with another country's rulings. The Australian Sheepskin Association is attempting to change the name UGG into a regional mark similar to that achieved for Champagne which would negate its trademark status in many jurisdictions. Deckers in response has focused on the fact that its UGG boots are made in China and not Australia.UGG Trademark Disputes Azrights Solicitors. London April 8, 2013 In 2012, sales of Deckers UGG boots totaled over US$630 million while the UGG brand, which now includes hats, scarves, gloves, slippers, casuals, jackets, coats, and handbags totaled over US$1 billion with 30% of sales outside of the United States. Trademark infringement cases *During a trademark infringement and trade dress case in 2008, a generic term defense was rejected by a Dutch court as not being applicable to counterfeit goods. The court also rejected La Cheapa's claim that as Australian companies believe \\"ugg\\" was a generic name, the \\"UGG AUSTRALIA\\" mark was not protected in the Benelux, noting that La Cheapa also admitted knowing that UGG in the Benelux is a famous brand which undermined their argument that UGG was generic. La Cheapa distributed sheepskin boots it had purchased from a supplier in China on an Internet site from the Netherlands, describing them on its website as \\"100% authentic Ugg Australian boots!!!\\", with \\"UGG logo on the heel\\" and in boxes virtually identical to Deckers packaging. These were found by the court to be counterfeits. The Deckers case had also included La Cheapa's sale of imported boots manufactured by Jumbo Ugg Boots Binder Production Pty Ltd in Melbourne, Australia branded Jumbo Uggs. The court stated that \\"given the exact similarity of the goods (namely: boots)\\" and the fact that the word \\"ugg\\" was part of the brand, and the undisputed fact that the \\"UGG brand\\" was popular in the Benelux, it found that the importation and distribution of sheepskin boots which contained the word \\"ugg\\" in its label took an \\"unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character of the brand UGG\\" and was thus an infringement of the Deckers trademark. *On December 25, 2010, Deckers filed a trademark infringement suit in a bid to stop Emu Australia from using the UGG name on its sales website. On December 30 Emu Australia counter-sued for the cancellation of Deckers' UGG trademark in the US. Emu's suit alleged that Deckers' trademark was obtained after a false statement to the US Patent and Trademark Office and was therefore invalid. On 25 August 2011, the case was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of the parties but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. *In 2010, the validity of the UGG trademark was challenged in a Turkish court by a local manufacturer after his application to register a trademark containing the words UGGBOOTS and AUSTRALIA was rejected. Judge Verda √ái√ßekli ruled for Deckers, finding that UGG was not a generic term and did not have any descriptive nature in the Turkish language, except to refer to Deckers products. The court further ruled that UGG was a well-known trademark that has gained recognition and distinctiveness worldwide, and while acknowledging the challenger's allegations that UGG was a generic term in Australia, ruled that such alleged facts have no bearing on the validity of the trademark within Turkey. Deckers was also awarded costs in the action. *In 2010, IP Australia ruled on the trademark opposition dispute between Deckers and Luda Production Pty Ltd, granting Luda the right to register the trademarks UGG AUSTRALIA (& Design) and MADE BY UGG AUSTRALIA with costs awarded against Deckers. Luda declared that the \\"element ugg\\" was used generically in the sheepskin boot market but that its use had not caused any confusion with Luda's UGG AUSTRALIA products. Luda began manufacturing ugg boots in 1981 and in 1982 began selling its boots with woven heel counters featuring the UGG AUSTRALIA mark. In 1984, the company was incorporated at which time Luda had attempted to trademark its UGG AUSTRALIA logo but was asked by the Trade Mark Office not to proceed as the name was \\"descriptive\\" and was therefore not registerable.UGG AUSTRALIA: fight over trade mark registration continues Freehills Patent & Trade Mark Attorneys February 8, 2011 In 2004, Luda filed another trademark application after becoming aware of \\"other products being sold bearing variations of the element UGG\\" in conjunction with the word \\"Australia.\\" Deckers opposed the application on three grounds, prior use (Deckers argued that the prior use shown by Luda was invalid as the mark they sought to register was not \\"an exact copy\\" of the mark they used), that Deckers had a more significant reputation in Australia and that Luda had filed the application in bad faith. The court found that Deckers did not have a significant reputation in an Australian market which was dominated by Luda Productions, and thus failed the requirements of the Trade Practices Act, regarding public misapprehension of the origin of the manufacturer. The court noted that Luda's use of the term \\"UGG AUSTRALIA\\" predated Deckers' infringement defense by 22 years, which negated Deckers' claim that Luda was trading upon their reputation and that Luda had not filed in bad faith, but in order to gain statutory protection for trade marks already recognized in Australia.Don't feel sheepish about your uggies The Advertiser February 28, 2011 Regarding a non-use action between Deckers and Luda Production Pty, IP Australia confirmed that Deckers owned the trademark of their UGG AUSTRALIA label (with sun-like device), however the scope of Deckers' trademark was narrowed, restricted to just footwear. *In 2011, Deckers filed suit against the Chinese company Dangdang for allegedly selling counterfeit Uggs at the Jingdong Mall and on Taobao, a Chinese language website similar to eBay and Amazon. Known as \\"snow boots\\" in China, Dangdang had been selling Australian made boots labeled Merino World UGG. In defense, a spokesperson from Jingdong Mall argued that the boots were a different brand to Deckers with the letters in the word \\"UGG\\" designed differently. In support, he cited Baidu Baike, the Chinese online encyclopedia, which describes Ugg as a generic term for sheepskin boots. Asked to comment, the media and public relations Manager of the Australian Trade Commission attached to the Australian Embassy in Shanghai, Anthony-Yan stated that the snow boots style originated in Australia where all such boots are referred to as UGG boots. The Australian manufacturers' logos contained the word \\"UGG\\" in large block letters on the heel of the boot, and the court found that this practice deceived the ordinary consumer.\\"Ugg\\" snow boots trademark dispute. Daanba.com (Chinese language website of Zhao Blue trademarks law firm.) \\"The difference between the two [logos] is subtle ... enough to mislead the public.\\" The court ruled that use of the word \\"ugg\\" in Chinese commerce was an infringement of the Deckers Chinese \\"UGG\\" trademark, and held the manufacturers and distribution firms liable. The Shanghai suburb of Gaoqiao is the nation's largest production base for snow boots with more than 200 businesses manufacturing footwear valued at more than 1 billion yuan (US$163 million) annually; it is also \\"the nation's largest production base for imitation UGG brands,\\" with an estimated 150 companies producing counterfeit UGGs. Deckers UGG boots cost from 1,500 to 8,000 yuan (US$240 to US$1,300) in China when demand exceeded supply in 2011, which led to a large market for both counterfeit UGGs and the lower priced uggs imported from Australia.UGG trademark dispute creates industry market chaos.

It was written by Caillat and Ryan Tedder, and produced by Tedder and it features American rapper Common. The song was released as the third single from her third studio album All of You (2011). it was released on May 8, 2012. Musically, the song is a guitar-driven pop, hip-hop jam, and the lyrics speak about being in love with someone and desiring that the person feels the same. The song is a metaphor for wanting to be the object of someone‚Äôs affection. The song received mixed reviews, some critics commended the track for having a \\"summer and island vibe\\", but some others dismissed Common's appearance and the chorus. They performed the track for the first time on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The music video for the song was released on May 3, 2012. The video was filmed outdoors by the beach and palm trees of Venice, California. In the video, the two singers, along with other party people, take over the streets and skate parks of the ocean walk. Teenagers rocked bikinis and rollerblades as Common rapped away before the sunset. == Background and release== \\"I've loved Common's music for years,\\" Caillat says of the unlikely pairing, which was put into motion when the two artists met each other at an event for the Grammys in 2009. \\"He ended up singing his song 'The Light,' and he needed a girl singer [for the chorus] and I was like, 'I know it!' Afterward he was like, \\"I love your song and I love your voice.' It took about a year for us to get something together, but it worked out better than we could have imagined.\\" American hip-hop artist Common is featured on the track. At the Universal Republic website, it was initiated a poll to decide the third single of the album. Later, she announced that Favorite Song was chosen as the third single. On April 6, Caillat and Common performed the song for the first time ever on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. ==Composition and lyrics== \\"Favorite Song\\" is a guitar-driven pop song, written by Caillat and co-written and produced by Ryan Tedder.

Colbie sings, \\"I‚Äôll be the thing that you want to sing back / Stuck in your head like I knew you would.\\" In the sing-a-long chorus, she sings: ‚ÄúI want to be your favorite song/ You can turn it up/ Turn me on all night long/ I want to be your favorite song/ La-la-la-la, la-la-la / I want to be your melody/ Going through your head when you think of me/ I want to be your favorite song/ La-la-la-la.‚Äù Meanwhile, Common‚Äôs lyrics are softhearted as he tries his hand at crooning. ‚ÄúGirl the songs you sing / They my favorite things / You stay in my dreams / Something so supreme,‚Äù he warbles. Later, he raps: ‚ÄúWe stay in tune with each other / And in our room we will discover / New ways to do covers / No matter how they dub us / We should stay true to the trust / And the winner of the best duo/ Is us.‚Äù ==Critical reception== Bill Lamb wrote for About.com that the song \\"is bright, summery, and it is utterly charming\\". Mike Diver from BBC Music wrote that the song has \\"a Bruno Mars-style summertime vibe to it, and the rapper is a reliable presence on any recording.\\" Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly called it \\"an island groove\\". Melinda Newman from HitFix wrote that \\"she shakes things up a little with the track and Common‚Äôs gruff rap proves the perfect foil to Caillat‚Äôs smooth, Sheryl Crow-redolent vocals.\\" Trent Fitzgerald wrote a positive review for \\"Pop Crush\\", stating that \\" is the two-time Grammy-winner‚Äôs metaphoric love ditty that features playful electric guitars and feel-good lyrics.\\" He also wrote that \\" is the perfect sunshine-y ballad for the summer and it will most likely do well on Hot Adult Contemporary radio.\\" Michelle Thompson wrote a positive review for The Tune, writing that on the album, the song \\"stands out the most with an absolutely infectious melody and hook, this is the track that will have you dancing nonstop, and it might get stuck in your head for a long while.\\" Idolator staff wrote that \\"With a sweetly strummed guitar groove, charming reliance on la la‚Äôs and woo-hoo‚Äôs, and riding-in-a-car-with-the-top-down rhythm, 'Favorite Song' is instantly recognizable as a Colbie Caillat hit-in-the-making and Common lends a little hip-hop credibility to the track, offering three rhymed verses plus a little sing-song help later on.\\" Jaymie Baxley wrote an extense review for Slant Magazine, declaring that \\"the appearance of Common on 'Favorite Song' does threaten to disrupt business as usual. In fact, the harsh strums of electric guitar that preface the rapper's unexpected guest turn seem obstinately placed there to alert the listener of the ostensibly provocative rap verse to follow. But then Common starts dispensing bars of clumsy, musical-themed innuendo; it becomes clear that the song is just as bland and inoffensive as the rest of the album and those guitars were merely a tease. And the chorus is laughably unsexy: 'I want to be your favorite song/You can turn it up, play me all night long'.\\" Another negative review came from Sputnikmusic, who wrote that \\"Caillat concocts what is quite possibly her cheesiest chorus yet, and it probably goes without saying that Common sounds sorely out of place. It is actually kind of reminiscent of those old-school Radio Disney songs that would mimic the melody of some major hit, make it a thousand times cheesier, and then have a rapper enter midway through to appeal to the ‚Äúnew, hip generation.‚Äù Needless to say, Colbie‚Äôs hip-hop experiment ends in futility.\\" Andrea Hinton from Stanford Daily wrote that the song \\"has Caillat almost yelling during the grating chorus and, along with an unbelievably underwhelming contribution from rapper Common, seems out of place in the album.\\" ==Chart performance== The song debuted at number forty on the Adult Pop Songs chart. It later, climbed to number thirty-five. In the third week, it reached a peak of number twenty-nine. In the fourth week, the song reached number twenty-seven. The song ultimately peaked at number 21. == Music video == Venice beach in California. A music video for the song was shot on March 29, 2012 on the beach in Venice, California. The singer posted a photo from herself and Common on the set of the music video. Colbie spoke about the video in an interview: > \\"It‚Äôs a really cool concept. Common and I are singing on the rooftop of this > house, overlooking the beach in Venice [California]. Basically the music > travels down throughout the town and though the beach. It hits everyone and > they all start singing it, and these people in their bathing suits walking > on the boardwalk or guys on skateboards, they all find the music and come up > to me and Common on the rooftop and watch us perform for them.\\" The music video premiered on May 2, 2012. It is \\"a bright, beach-set\\" video that features Caillat and Common bopping around young beautiful people shooting hoops, skateboarding, catching rays and walking on the Venice boardwalk. ==Charts== {  - !

He sometimes signed his illustration and cartoon work Fix. == Early life == Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Kelly was the second son of Felix Vincent Kelly, a prosperous engineer, and his much younger wife, Hortense Agnes Kelly n√©e Runcie. Kelly attended King's College but was mostly home-schooled in his younger years. He trained as a graphic artist and designer and also sold the occasional cartoon. His father went bankrupt in 1933 and his mother left him to live in England. Kelly left New Zealand in 1935 and joined his mother in London. He never returned to New Zealand. In London Kelly was soon employed as a graphic designer at Lintas, the advertising wing of Unilever. At the outbreak of the Second World War he enlisted in the Royal Air Force where he became a navigating officer. In 1943 he suffered a severe illness that ended his active service and resulted in Kelly focussing on his painting. == Artistic career == Kelly's paintings were influenced by the Surrealists. His specialisation in domestic architecture and regular commissions saw him develop a romantic style that found more favour with his clientele and often included a number of recurring motifs such as red and white striped deckchairs, and items of mechanical engineering such as hot air balloons, paddle steamers, railways, trains, trams, and lighting fixtures. His paintings were meticulously executed. Houses were painted to an architecturally accurate standard but often contrasted with an untamed, almost sinister landscape. Kelly's first one-man show was in 1943 at the Lefevre Gallery. This was a success. Herbert Read, the writer and art critic, bought a painting and invited Kelly to illustrate the second edition of his short novel, The Green Child. Kelly accepted the commission. Read returned the favour by writing the introduction to the book Paintings by Felix Kelly published in 1946 by Falcon Press. In 1944 a larger exhibition of Kelly's works opened at the same gallery with works by Lucian Freud and Julian Trevelyan in adjoining rooms. Kelly accepted numerous commissions for paintings, murals and for illustration work. His commissions led him to visit and stay at many of the grandest country houses in the United Kingdom. His personality, wit, and charm ensured he was often invited back by his wealthy clients and, in some cases, developed into lifelong friendships. In 1947 he was invited to the United States by the New York gallery Portraits, Inc. Cond√© Nast Publications commissioned him to paint a number of important American houses and the publication of these works led to more commissions in the United States. The same year he also illustrated for the Lilliput magazine. He fulfilled commissions in the UK, United States, Russia, North Africa, the Far East, and the Caribbean. In addition to painting he was often in demand as a muralist and interior designer. His own apartment was photographed and featured in magazines a number of times. He completed a mural for the banqueting hall of the Royal Palace, Kathmundu, Nepal, murals in a number of Union Castle and Cunard liners, but probably his most well known commission was the four murals painted in the Garden Hall at Castle Howard in 1982. These murals were commissioned by George Howard and paid for with the location fee from the Brideshead Revisited television production. Kelly also designed the Kelly car at Castle Howard, a little fairground-style train for conveying visitors round the grounds. Kelly also worked on developing architectural ideas for his clientele. He produced an artist's impression of a Palladian temple for Sebastian de Ferranti, who then worked with various architects to realise the design. de Ferranti chose Julian Bicknell to build the house which was completed in 1986 Later Kelly worked on the Cave, a modern grotto, at Henbury Hall. Kelly remodelled the house of Sir Michael Blake at Cornhill-on-Tweed and designed it as a Gothic dowerhouse. On the request of Charles, Prince of Wales Kelly produced an artist's impression of an improved design of the Prince of Wales' residence Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. This became the inspiration of the remodelling of Highgrove. Kelly also produced set designs for a number of theatre productions including: * Production: A Day by the Sea, 1953, the Haymarket. This production starred Sybil Thorndike and John Gielgud * Production: World premier of the Opera Nelson, 1954, Sadler's Wells Theatre * Production: The Merchant of Venice, 1960‚Äì61, the Old Vic * Production: The Last Joke, 1960, the Phoenix Kelly illustrated a number of books including a very successful collaboration his friend Elizabeth Burton whose four-volume series on the domestic interiors and furnishings of Elizabethans, Jacobeans, Georgians and early Victorians ideally fit Kelly's aesthetic. His tendency towards the surreal and sinister was reflected in the dust jacket work he did for Faber and Faber's Best of series including Best Horror Stories (1957), Best Detective Stories (1959), and Best Tales of Terror (1962), as well as a beautiful wrap-around dust jacket for Haunted Houses (1956) by Joseph Braddock. He also illustrated * Twilight Stories (1947) by Rhoda Broughton * A Strange Adventure in the Life of Miss Laura Mildmay (1947) by J Sheridan Le Fanu * The Desperate Art: a novel (1955) by John Rosenberg * Pilgrim's pleasure: the West Country (1959) by Alan Ivimey * London (1960) by Ivor Brown * Castle Howard (1972) by George Howard * Lincolnshire churches: Their past and their future edited by Henry Thorold == Death == Kelly was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1992 and died in Devon in 1994. His partner, the garden designer Vernon Russell-Smith inherited his estate. == Work in Public collections == * Kelly's archive of sketches, photographs and papers is held by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, who also own 2 paintings *The RW Norton Art Foundation owns 23 paintings *Hawke's Bay Museum and Art Gallery owns 8 paintings *Various British public institutions own 7 paintings ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:New Zealand painters Category:New Zealand interior designers Category:New Zealand illustrators Category:New Zealand surrealist artists ","title":"Felix Kelly"},{"id":"35280186","text":"Busch is an unincorporated community in Carroll County, Arkansas, United States.

It retains the U.S. Highway 89 (US-89) designation for all but the northernmost seven blocks (which are part of State Route 186 (SR-186) instead) despite I-15's proximity. Due to its history as a route for long-distance travel, travel within the Wasatch Front region, and travel between the cities along the east side of the Jordan River, it has attracted a wide variety of retail and service businesses along its entire length, creating a nearly continuous commercial axis for the Salt Lake Valley. ==Route description== Other than along a portion of its length in Midvale and southern Murray that is currently (as of 2012) being rebuilt and widened to match the rest, the entire length of State Street south of South Temple has sidewalks on both sides and is a uniform six lanes in width plus either a center turn lane or (occasionally) a low median barrier. There is also local Utah Transit Authority bus service along the entire length of the street. Draper Modern State Street starts in Draper near I-15's exit 291 with a connection to Utah State Route 71 (12300 South). It intersects Utah State Route 175 (11400 South) on the border with Sandy. Sandy Just west of State Street, the Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy State Street continues north through the Crescent neighborhood, past the site of the historic Crescent Elementary School, and enters Downtown Sandy. It intersects 10600 South, which becomes State Route 151 a short distance to the west, and passes a large retail area that includes big box stores and the South Towne Mall. The street climbs a small hill to pass over the Jordan and Salt Lake Canal, then passes a cemetery and a small amount of undeveloped greenfield land near the crossing of Dry Creek before reaching a larger hill into which the East Jordan Canal is carved. At the top of this hill, the street passes west of Jordan High School and the South Towne Expo Center before intersecting 9400 South (former State Route 209). A short distance north of that intersection, the East Jordan Canal passes back under the street on its way toward Holladay, and Rio Tinto Stadium fronts onto the street on the west side. Just before the intersection with 9000 South (modern State Route 209), State Street passes the site of a former smelter (which now has a medical center built on part of it). The street forms the western boundary of the Sandy Historic District from 9000 South to Pioneer Avenue (8530 South), and several historic buildings face onto it in this area. There is a traffic signal it the intersection with Sandy's Main Street at 8720 South. North of the historic district, State Street passes through some relatively lightly developed land near the city's border with Midvale, though there are some townhouse developments in progress in the area. Midvale Soon after entering Midvale, State Street passes over the Jordan and Salt Lake Canal a second time and then quickly drops into a trench to pass under the UTA TRAX Blue Line. Upon rising up out of the trench again, it intersects 7800 South and a walkway leading west a short distance (along the south edge of the Midvale post office's facilities) to the Blue Line's Midvale Center station. A short distance north of this intersection is the intersection with Center Street (7720 South and previously State Route 48). The Greenwood Health Center of the University of Utah Healthcare system is on the east side of the street north of 7500 South (Greenwood Avenue). At Fort Union Boulevard (7200 South), State Street enters a denser commercial corridor with strip malls along a large portion of the route until the border with Murray and starts to curve very slightly to the east. Murray Iris Theater is along State Street in Murray State Street proceeds through most of Murray at an angle slightly off from its perfect north-south orientation elsewhere, moving 100 address units (660 feet, 200m) east over the span of about 2000 north-to-south address units (2.5 miles, 4 km). Similar to the northern end of Midvale's segment, State Street south of Interstate 215 in Murray is mostly surrounded by strip malls and a mixture of other small specialized retail businesses. After crossing Interstate 215 (where there is an eastbound-only on- and off-ramp pair), State Street intersects Winchester Street (which connects to the westbound ramps) and passes west of the Fashion Place Mall. Various big box stores line the street near the mall, and the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (TOSH, previously Cottonwood Hospital) is just to the east of State Street on 5900 South. Between 5900 South and 5300 South, there is a concentration of car dealerships. Murray High School and Hillcrest Junior High School (not to be confused with Hillcrest High School) are on opposite sides of the street south of 5300 South (State Route 173) and are connected by a pedestrian bridge. North of 5300 South, State Street passes the Intermountain Medical Center (built on the site of the Murray Smelter) and Murray Park before crossing Little Cottonwood Creek and entering the Murray Downtown Historic District. Within Murray's downtown area, State Street passes Murray's city hall and the Murray Theater before intersecting Vine Street (former State Route 173). It passes the Desert Star Theater, the Warenski- Duvall Commercial Building and Apartments, and other traditional zero-setback buildings with ground floor retail while running just west of the Murray Downtown Residential Historic District, then intersects 4800 South (former State Route 174, also known as Murray-Holladay Road east of State Street and Murray-Taylorsville Road west of State Street) less than two blocks north of the Vine Street intersection. Beyond that, the surroundings revert to lower density development (including many car dealerships) before State Street intersects 4500 South (State Route 266) and approaches the crossing of Big Cottonwood Creek. Near the creek and the boundary of Millcreek Township, the street passes east of transit-oriented development around the Murray North light rail station and then the Murray Laundry Tower, a multi-story high concrete cylinder of Art Deco design with a vertically oriented sign reading \\"Rain Soft Artesian Water Murray Laundry\\" on top. Millcreek Township Millcreek Township's short portion of State Street includes a mixture of small-scale retail and car dealerships similar to the adjacent parts of Murray and South Salt Lake. It enters South Salt Lake at the intersection with 3900 South. South Salt Lake Just inside the boundaries of South Salt Lake, State Street passes the world's first Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise, which is on the west side of the street. The location is still a KFC restaurant, but the original building has been replaced with a new one. A few blocks north of that is the Avalon Theater. South of 3300 South (State Route 171), there is a Chinatown-themed development. State Street crosses Mill Creek at approximately 3000 South and then passes a combined Granite School District elementary school and administration building located in a former hospital at around 2500 South. State Street provides access to I-80 at I-80's exit 124. South Salt Lake's city hall is just to the east of State Street in this area, on the south side of I-80. Beyond I-80, State Street crosses the S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) right-of-way and passes through an area with many disused industrial buildings that is planned for redevelopment in connection with the streetcar project. Salt Lake City State Street passes to the west of the Salt Lake City and County Building State Street enters Salt Lake City at 2100 South (State Route 201) and immediately passes west of the Salt Lake County Government Center. North of 1700 South, it passes west of a Salt Lake Community College campus built around the former South High School and then passes west of the Liberty Wells neighborhood. North of 900 South (former State Route 176) State Street has traffic signals every block, which is a change from the long signal spacings (often a half-mile or more) that benefit long-distance traffic further south. Outside of the somewhat similar Murray Downtown Historic District, the frontage from 700 South to 600 South is unique within State Street's length due to its uninterrupted mix of zero-setback pre-war-style buildings. 500 South and 600 South (both State Route 269) are one-way streets that provide access to and from I-15, respectively. Between 500 South and 400 South, State Street passes between the Scott Matheson State Courthouse and Washington Square, site of the City and County Building. The UTA TRAX Red Line crosses State Street in the median of 400 South. 400 South is also where US Highway 89 turns west to bypass the core of downtown; State Street north of 400 South as well as 400 South west of State Street have the State Route 186 designation instead. The area northwest of the 400 South intersection is the Exchange Place Historic District, and the middle of the block northwest of the 300 South (Broadway) intersection is the Gallivan Center. Between 200 South and South Temple, State Street passes the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco building, the Wallace Bennett Federal Building, the City Creek Center, and the former Hansen Planetarium building. State Street is spanned by the Eagle Gate just north of South Temple, next to the Beehive House and Brigham Young Complex. The LDS Church Office Building is at the southwest corner of State Street's intersection with North Temple (100 North and previously the route used by US-89 to leave the core of downtown). City Creek disappears underground near this intersection. Beyond North Temple, State Street suddenly narrows and begins climbing Capitol Hill. State Street ends two blocks later at the steps leading to the Utah Capitol Building. State Route 186 continues by turning west on 300 North, then quickly north again to eventually reach US Highway 89 northwest of Capitol Hill. ==Addressing== South of Murray, State Street is closely aligned with the north-south axis of the Salt Lake County addressing system (essentially the Salt Lake Meridian). In Murray, however, it gradually diverts eastward before coming into alignment with 100 East (that is, it moves eastward by about 660 feet, which is Salt Lake City's block width). North of Murray, Main Street runs along the north-south axis of the addressing system instead. This does not cause much confusion for people looking for businesses along State Street since most businesses have addresses of the form \\"#### South State Street\\" (rather than something involving the name of a side street) due to State Street's recognizability; however, there are exceptions to this, mostly in downtown Murray, and residential addressing adheres strictly to the north-south axis, so it is not always easy to determine what side of State Street an address in Murray of the form \\"x East y Street\\" is on when x is between 0 and 100. As with all north-south streets in Salt Lake County, odd-numbered addresses that are south of South Temple are on the east side of State Street, while north of South Temple, odd-numbered addresses are on the west side. ==History== State Street north of Vine Street in Murray was used as part of the route for wagons carrying quartz monzonite quarried at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon for use in building the Salt Lake Temple, until railroads provided an easier route. Streetcars also extended south along the street as far as Murray in the early 20th century. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, state street carried US-91 through the Salt Lake Valley. In the 1930s, US-89 was extended, using State Street. US 91 was truncated in 1974, however, State Street remains signed as US 89 today. State Street originally continued south of its current terminus along the route now used by I-15: it continued straight south along the Salt Lake Meridian until turning to run along the Utah Southern Railroad right-of-way, which is now owned by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and proposed for use in phase two of the UTA's TRAX Blue Line, around Point of the Mountain. Beyond Point of the Mountain, it connected directly to Utah County's State Street. From the time that I-15 was built until around the year 2000, State Street's vehicle lanes connected directly to I-15 at the point at which I-15 came into alignment with the Salt Lake Meridian, but this north-south-only connection was eliminated as I-15 was rebuilt in favor of an omnidirectional exit at SR-71 just to the south because of increasing development on all sides. In 1983, City Creek flooded and a large part of its flow was redirected down State Street as far as the storm drains of Red Butte Creek's watershed near 1300 South. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * Main Street (Greater Salt Lake City), Salt Lake City's most important commercial street, which runs parallel to State Street just one block west * Redwood Road (part of State Route 68), the closest equivalent to State Street on the west side of the Jordan River * Utah State Route 106, which in most places follows the oldest road leading north from Salt Lake City * Suzaku Boulevard, the concept of a great street leading to the seat of government from the south, as applied in historic Japanese city planning ==ReferencesExternal references== Category:Transportation in Salt Lake County, Utah Category:Streets in Utah Category:Transportation in Salt Lake City Category:U.S. Route 89 Category:U.S. Route 91 ","title":"State Street (Salt Lake County)"},{"id":"35280214","text":"\\"Nothing As It Seems\\" is the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the Fox science-fiction drama television series Fringe, and the series' 81st episode overall. The case of the episode is a parallel observation to the events of the first season's \\"The Transformation\\". It was co-written by Jeff Pinkner and Akiva Goldsman, while Frederick E. O. Toye directed. ==Plot== The Fringe team is alerted to a case involving a passenger, Marshall Bowman (Neal Huff), on a plane that had transformed into a strange beast, due to a \\"designer virus\\" with which he had been injected. Peter immediately recognizes this as a case from his original timeline (\\"The Transformation\\") but in this timeline, Bowman never fully transformed on the plane, allowing it to land safely. However, while under investigation by the TSA, Bowman transformed and attacked the agents before dying. Meanwhile, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), having accepted the replacement of her memories with those from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) original timeline, is determined to be unfit for field work because she can't remember her \\"real\\" past, forgetting even family details. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) is put in charge of the Fringe team, though he is upset that Peter has won Olivia's heart over himself. Peter is able to use his recollection of the Bowman case to lead them to Daniel Hicks, who was to receive the designer virus before he too transformed. Olivia joins them at Hicks' house, where Hicks, now transformed, escapes, injuring Lincoln. However, Astrid discovers that Conrad Moreau, the bio-terrorist Peter says was responsible for Bowman and Hicks' transformations in the original timeline, died five years previously. This and the fact that Bowman didn't make the plane crash, as Peter remembers, suggest that events are playing out differently. Walter Bishop (John Noble) worries that Lincoln may be infected by the virus, and keeps him in the lab to study him. Peter and Olivia identify a tattoo on Bowman's corpse with the help of Edward Markham (Clark Middleton), who in this timeline does not know Peter or Olivia. He is able to identify it as a cuneiform symbol of a cult that wants to create a new evolution of mankind, or \\"mutation by design\\". (And indeed the transformed Hicks is welcomed by a woman (Gina Holden) who gives him an injection and dreams of joining him in his \\"special\\" state.) Walter is able to link the group to Massive Dynamic, but Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), on searching the company's records for work in human transformation, finds the project files deleted by David Robert Jones, as he had overseen the project during his tenure with the company. Watching Lincoln's behavior, Walter identifies that those infected with the drug use fat stored in their body as energy to fuel the transformation, while drugs carried by Bowman would be used to slow the transformation, allowing the user to survive it. Walter further identifies that the creatures are likely acquiring fat from the residue of plastic surgery clinics. Further recognizing that the Hicks creature is nocturnal and can fly, Lincoln leads the team to stop the creature along with the woman who was caring for it. The creature is killed, while the woman is unable to supply answers about where the designer virus originated from. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) admits to Olivia that while she may be losing part of her memories, she is still considered an asset and is allowed back to active duty. Walter speculates that Jones may be using these transformed humans as part of a scheme to take control of the fate of humanity. Marshall Bowman's sister, who had earlier claimed ignorance, is shown trying to motivate another man to inject the transformation formula. The episode ends by revealing a container ship that contains a number of other transformed humans and other creatures at sea that are kept locked in cages in pairs. ==Production== \\"Nothing As It Seems\\" was co-written by consulting producer Akiva Goldsman and co-showrunner Jeff Pinkner. Former Fringe producer, Frederick E. O. Toye, returned to direct the installment. ==Cultural references== The opening sequence and main case of the episode were allusions to the first-season episode \\"The Transformation\\". Peter breaks the ice with bookdealer Edward Markham by asking if he has Gene Wolfe's Lake of the Long Sun. The song playing in Olivia's apartment while she talks to Peter is \\"Time Spent in Los Angeles\\" by Dawes. Walter mentions that William Bell's father taught him Yiddish and later speaks a sentence in Yiddish. In real life as well, Bell's actor Leonard Nimoy grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Nothing As It Seems\\" received a rating of 3.1 million viewers with a 1.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic, an improvement upon the previous episode \\"A Short Story About Love\\" by 33.3%.

The two met 24 times in official Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) matches, and Federer led 21‚Äì3, making Roddick the player with the third-most tournament defeats to Federer in the ATP circuit (Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka have lost to Federer on 23 occasions, but Djokovic currently holds a positive record against him). In terms of number of matches played, it ranks as the 14th largest rivalry in the Open Era. Both men are Grand Slam champions (Federer with 20 titles to Roddick's one) and former world number one players. Roddick has lost four Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon in 2004, 2005, and 2009, and the US Open in 2006), each time to Federer. Their match in the 2009 Wimbledon final, where Roddick brought Federer to a thirty-game fifth set, has been called one of the greatest matches in tennis history. On February 2, 2004, Federer supplanted Roddick as World No. 1 to begin his record reign of 237 consecutive weeks at #1. They were the two highest-ranked players in the world from November 2003 to January 2005. Roddick retired in 2012, ending the rivalry. ==Notable matches== 2002 Basel Quarterfinal The third match played between Federer and Roddick was in Federer's hometown of Basel, Switzerland, at the 2002 Davidoff Swiss Indoors. Federer had won the first set in a tiebreak and was up by a break in the second set when Federer made what Patrick McEnroe said was the \\"best shot of his career\\". In the point, Roddick served to Federer and moved up to the net, implying that he would use a serve and volley tactic. However, he forced a weak return from Federer and hit an overhead smash that appeared to be a winner. Federer managed to run across the court and hit a slicing overhead, however, and Roddick watched as the shot landed just within the line, giving Federer the point. Federer went on to win the match in straight sets. Federer won the fifth Grand Slam of his career at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships. 2003 Wimbledon semifinal Both players had advanced to their first Wimbledon semifinals with relative ease, each one of them having lost only one set en route to the semifinal, and the winner of the match would be a heavy favorite against Mark Philippoussis in the final. The first set was close, and went to a tie break. In the tiebreak Roddick held set point at 6‚Äì5, however he would commit a forehand error into the net and Federer would go on to win the set, and the match 7‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3 before defeating Phillipoussis in the final to win his first of eight Wimbledon titles. 2003 Montreal semifinal Going into the match a win would have given Federer the number one ranking for the first time in his career. Roddick, the sixth seed at the 2003 Canada Masters tournament, had suffered four straight losses to Federer when he entered the match. He won the first set against Federer, who was the third seed, but Federer answered by winning the second set. In the third set, they went to their fifth tiebreaker in five matches, and Roddick prevailed to score his first victory over Federer. Roddick would go on to win back-to-back Masters tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati, and the 2003 US Open, allowing him to secure the World No. 1 ranking. 2004 Wimbledon final The 2004 Wimbledon Final marked the first time they had met in the final of any tournament and the first time they played as the top two players in the world. Roddick was able to break Federer's serve and win the first set by using his powerful forehand, but Federer bounced back and took the second and third sets, winning the third set in a tiebreak. Roddick continued to keep the match close in the fourth set, but Federer held him off to win his second Wimbledon title and third Grand Slam title. 2005 Wimbledon final In 2005, Federer and Roddick played each other at Wimbledon for the third consecutive year and for the second straight year in the final. However, unlike their meeting last year, Federer won the first set with ease, breaking Roddick twice during the set. Roddick forced a tiebreak in the second set, but Federer prevailed in the tiebreak. Federer then proceeded to finish off the match after breaking Roddick once more, winning it in straight sets. It was Federer's third consecutive Wimbledon title and his fifth Grand Slam title. Federer won the ninth Grand Slam of his career at the 2006 US Open. 2006 US Open final The 2006 US Open final marked the sixth consecutive meeting in a final between Roddick and Federer, and their third consecutive in the final of a Grand Slam. Federer broke Roddick twice in the first set to win it, but Roddick broke Federer early in the second set, and held the early lead to win the set. Federer grabbed a late break against Roddick to prevent a tiebreak and win the third set, and he cruised past Roddick in the fourth set to win his third consecutive US Open. 2007 Australian Open semifinal Before the 2007 Australian Open, Roddick had challenged Federer in both the US Open final and the year-end championships in Shanghai and had pulled off an impressive victory over him at an exhibition tournament in Kooyong. Roddick had received much attention for claiming that he felt the gap between him and Federer was closing. Many pundits, and commentators, had expressed their belief that Roddick would finally win his second major at this event. The match began as a close affair until Federer broke Roddick late in the set and served out the set. Federer then proceeded to fly past Roddick, breaking him three times in the second set and two times in the third set to wrap up the match, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2. Following the match, Roddick gave his most famous press conference. When asked how he felt at the end of the match, Roddick stated, \\"It was frustrating, you know, it was miserable, it sucked, it was terrible. But besides that it was fine\\". The nature of Roddick's defeat to Federer, especially considering how well he had played up until the final, made many seriously question whether Roddick would ever be able to win another major so long as Federer was playing. Federer's 2009 Wimbledon victory shattered the record of most Grand Slam titles, the most coveted record in all of tennis. 2008 Miami quarterfinal Before the matchup, both Federer and Roddick were having poor starts to their seasons; Roddick had suffered early losses in the Australian Open and in the Indian Wells Masters, while Federer was suffering from mononucleosis. At the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open (Miami Masters), Roddick won the first set tiebreak, but a break of serve in the second set allowed Federer to level the match. Roddick continued to play well, however, and won the third set, pulling out his second win over Federer and his first in almost five years. 2009 Australian Open semifinal Roger Federer and Andy Roddick met for a seventh time in a Grand Slam in the Semi Finals of the 2009 Australian Open. It marked their first Grand Slam contest in over a year. Roddick had beaten the defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals, and was having relative success under his new head coach Larry Stefanki. Despite Roddick's good form going into the match Federer was a straight sets winner taking the match 6‚Äì2 7‚Äì5 7‚Äì5. 2009 Wimbledon final Without question, the 2009 Wimbledon final was Federer and Roddick's most historic match, and their first meeting in a final since the 2006 US Open. Prior to the match, Federer had only dropped one set during the entire tournament, but Roddick had struggled to win his first three matches. Federer and Roddick were both serving well to start the match, but Roddick secured a break late in the set and took the first set. The second set went to a tiebreaker, and Roddick quickly secured four set points. But, on the first set point, Roddick mishit a backhand volley, and Federer took advantage of Roddick's miss to win five consecutive points and the second set. The third set also resulted in a tight tiebreak, which Federer won. However, in the fourth set, Roddick took momentum away from Federer with a well-placed backhand passing shot down the line to break Federer. Roddick managed to continue to hold for the rest of the set to take it 6‚Äì3. Through four sets, Federer was unable to break Roddick's powerful serve. In the deciding fifth set, both players held serve until the score was 15‚Äì14 and a mishit forehand by Roddick gave Federer a break point and match point. Federer converted the point to win the match, which gave Federer his sixth Wimbledon title. Federer also won his fifteenth Grand Slam, which broke Pete Sampras's record for most Grand Slams won. The match continues to hold the record for being the longest Wimbledon final in terms of games played. 2012 Miami 3rd round Federer and Roddick met for the 24th and final time in the 3rd round at Miami, with Federer leading the head to head 21‚Äì2. This was the first and only time they had met before the quarter-finals of any tournament. In the first set, both players held serve 6 times which led to a tiebreak in the first set, which Roddick won 7‚Äì6 (7‚Äì5). Federer cruised through the second set, winning it 6‚Äì1. Early in the third set, Roddick saved three break points for a crucial hold. The next game he broke Federer with four crushing forehand winners. Roddick went on to hold for the rest of the set, securing the win with a service winner in only the 3rd time he's beaten Federer. It proved to be their final meeting, as Roddick ended his career at the 2012 US Open, thus securing the head to head record at 21‚Äì3. ==List of all matches== {  style=\\"font-size:85%; width:43%;; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\\" - !Legend (2001‚Äì2008) !Legend (2009‚Äìpresent) !Federer !Roddick - f3e6d7;\\"  Grand Slam  Grand Slam  8  0 - ffc;\\"  Tennis Masters Cup  ATP World Tour Finals  3  0 - e9e9e9;\\"  ATP Masters Series  ATP World Tour Masters 1000  4  3 - d4f1c5;\\"  ATP International Series Gold  ATP World Tour 500 Series  2  0 -  ATP International Series  ATP World Tour 250 Series  4  0 -  colspan=2Total  21  3 } Singles Federer‚ÄìRoddick: 24 (21‚Äì3) { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" - !

Federer's birthday is August 8, 1981, while Roddick's is August 30, 1982. A different viewpoint of their career evolution is offered by taking the season they entered with an age of 17 as starting point. For instance in 2004, Federer started the season at 22 years old; at the end of that season, he accumulated a career record of four Grand Slam titles, a total of 22 singles titles. and his final ranking was No. 1 at 23 years old. * () = active record (updated Monday 30 January 2017) {class= !colspan=2Age (end of season)!!18!!19!!20!!21!!22!!23!!24!!25!!26!!27!!28!!29!!30!!31!!32!!33!!34!!35!!36 -

Written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by Bradley Buecker, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on April 17, 2012, and features a tribute to the 1970s movie Saturday Night Fever and its Bee Gees‚Äìinfused soundtrack. Upon its initial airing, this episode attracted 6.23 million American viewers and received a 2.4/7 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, an all-time low rating for the show in that demographic and a decrease in viewership of nearly 8% from the 2.7/8 rating/share and 6.76 million viewers of the previous episode, \\"Big Brother\\", which was broadcast on April 10, 2012. ==Plot== After seeing that seniors Mercedes (Amber Riley), Santana (Naya Rivera) and Finn (Cory Monteith) are uncertain about what to do with their future, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) attempt to motivate them through the 1970s movie Saturday Night Fever. Though most New Directions members don't like the idea of performing disco, they are enthusiastic about the prize Sue offers for the best performance. Wade Adams (Alex Newell), a transgender student from rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and a fan of Mercedes and Kurt (Chris Colfer), asks their advice about performing while presenting as female. They initially caution her against doing so, but Sue later convinces them to tell her to go ahead so that Vocal Adrenaline will lose their Regionals competition and not be competing against them at Nationals. Mercedes and Kurt later regret this reversal, and go to the competition to renew their original advice, but are stopped by Vocal Adrenaline's director, Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). Once Jesse realizes that Wade is on stage in female clothes, he attempts to order her off it, but Wade proves to be a success. Mercedes sings \\"Disco Inferno\\", and reveals that although she wants to be a star, she does not know to get a record deal and is leery of moving to California on her own. Her former boyfriend Sam (Chord Overstreet) later shows her a YouTube video that he posted of her choir room performance, which has received very enthusiastic feedback. He tells her he believes in her and her talent, and kisses her. After performing \\"If I Can't Have You\\", Santana reveals that she is not interested in attending college but wants to be famous by any means necessary. This prompts her girlfriend Brittany (Heather Morris) to post a sex tape of her and Santana so that Santana can become famous. Sue calls the pair into her office and tells Santana how disappointed she is in Santana's focus on fame at all costs as she feels that unlike many of the famous for being famous celebrities she has genuine talent. Sue then gives Santana a letter from one of the top college cheerleading programs in the country, which offers Santana a full scholarship, and reveals that it was Brittany's idea. Santana tells Brittany how much she loves her since no one had cared about her future as much as she did. Puck (Mark Salling) has been encouraging Finn to go to Los Angeles with him to partner in his pool-cleaning business, but Finn decides he will be going with Rachel to New York as originally planned. Although Puck is disappointed, he makes Finn promise that Finn will become successful in what he does with his life. Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn reconcile after their recent argument and Rachel attempts to help Finn find a dream of his own. Although Rachel, Will and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggest a number of colleges, Finn throws the brochures in the garbage. When confronted by Will about this, he explains that he feels he isn't qualified for anything. Will forces Finn to watch Saturday Night Fever, which proves to be inspirational: Finn sings \\"More Than a Woman\\" to Rachel, and tells her he wants to become an actor and has decided to enroll in the Actors Studio in New York City. ==Production== \\"Saturday Night Glee-ver\\" is the fourth episode in the third season to be directed by co-executive producer Bradley Buecker, and the second to be written by Matthew Hodgson. Shooting for the episode began on February 16, 2012, while the previous episode, \\"Big Brother\\", was still being filmed, and ended on March 7, 2012. At one point the episode uses brief scenes from season one episodes \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Mattress\\" and the season two episode \\"Duets\\". On January 15, 2012, two days before the first Glee winter episode was aired, it was announced that there would be an episode airing in April that featured the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Show co-creator Ryan Murphy said, \\"We've never done disco on the show, but I'm interested in the genius of the Bee Gees\\". This would be the second tribute episode in the third season, despite Murphy and co-creator Brad Falchuk previously stating that the season would only have a single tribute episode in the third season, and that episode had already been announced as \\"Michael\\", the second winter episode, which was being aired later in January. The night the episode aired, co-executive producer Ali Adler revealed in a tweet that the original illuminated dance floor featured in Saturday Night Fever was being reused for scenes in that night's episode. Jonathan Groff returns for his third season as a recurring special guest star in the role of Jesse St. James. Ryan Murphy had previously announced that Jesse would be returning near the end of the third season as the new coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, the group he had been the star of in the first season when they defeated New Directions in competition. The Glee Project runner-up Alex Newell, who won a two-episode recurring role on Glee, makes his first appearance in the role of Wade Adams, Vocal Adrenaline's lead singer. In addition to Groff and Newell, recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet) and Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen) and cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). Eight songs from the episode, all originally from Saturday Night Fever, have been released as singles available for digital download. These songs include five by the Bee Gees: \\"Night Fever\\", \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", \\"More Than a Woman\\" and \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\". The other three are \\"Disco Inferno\\" by The Trammps, Yvonne Elliman's \\"If I Can't Have You\\" and KC and the Sunshine Band's \\"Boogie Shoes\\". None of the songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100 or the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Saturday Night Glee-ver\\" was first broadcast on April 17, 2012 in the United States on Fox.

The film's cast consists of Parambrata Chatterjee, Koel Mallick, and Soumitra Chatterjee. The name is inspired by the erstwhile Hemlock Society, a society which was based in Santa Monica, US. The primary missions of this society included providing information to dying persons and supporting legislation permitting physician-assisted suicide. The movie was remade in Marathi in 2015 as Welcome Zindagi.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/Marathi- remake-of-Koel-Parambrata-starrer-Hemlock- Society/articleshow/36555925.cmshttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/remakes- of-bengali-films-whats-new-in-this-trend/articleshow/72241437.cms ==Plot== The movie is a very strong insight into psychological dilemma about the primal existence of life. It reiterates the fact that you can 'shock someone by letting her know that death is impending and inescapable.‚Äô It is a dark comedy which successfully evokes an awareness of life. The comic element is used dexterously to bring out the fear of death. The protagonist Meghna (Koel Mallick), misses her mother, hums the songs of her favorite Sidhartha Roy numbers, blames the new lady in her father‚Äôs life, shaken by the dejection by her fianc√©. Yet, as an escape route from the world of pain and suffering she goes to her father doctor to get prescribed sleeping pills. Ananda Kar (Parambrata) as the name suggests ‚Äòmake merry‚Äô refrains her from ending her life. He comes with an unusual proposal of imparting her technical know how about committing suicide. He adds 'the training will save you from embarrassment if suicide becomes a vain attempt'. Ananda Kar is the founder of the Hemlock Society, that teaches aspirants how to successfully commit suicide. The names of the professors are also significant of the tricks they will teach to execute the end. The society is a film studio. Meghna assembles with all other suicide aspirants being addressed by the over-enthusiastic professors, trainlet, jhulan, dhamani, raktim, shikha, all specialists in different suicide methods. Meghna goes with him, leaving a goodbye message for her parents at her apartment door. Dr. Basu comes in search of his daughter, finds the note and shatters in grievance. Dr. Basu and Niharika start their search for Meghna and almost leave no stone unturned. Meanwhile, at Hemlock Society, Meghna encounters with miscellaneous experiences related to humans lives and death. The three-day workshop at the society makes her understand the importance of life and what difference her loss would mean to her near and dear ones. The metamorphosis of Meghna occurs when she realizes the miseries of other inmates and considers herself lucky. On the final day, Meghna confesses to Ananda that she wants to live and a vital reason which worked behind her changing of mind is that she had fallen in love with Ananda. Ananda informs her that he is suffering from 'Lymphocytopenia' a medical condition for which he would survive only for two more years. Meghna leaves Hemlock Society, sobbing and returns to her father. The very thought that someone near the cradle of death can ‚Äòdrink life to the lees‚Äô in spite of complain and regret, surprises her. She learns from Ananda, that Hemlock society is an institute that refrains people from ending their life by making them aware of the importance of life. Six months later, Meghna reconciles with Ananda while he is on a nursing home bed, after having a blood-transfusion. The film ends with a witty note where Meghna‚Äôs fianc√© (Saheb Chatterjee), now a dejected soul and undoubtedly suicide aspirant, being taken to 'Hemlock Society'. ==Cast== * Koel Mallick as Meghna Sarkar * Parambrata Chatterjee as Ananda Kar * Roopa Ganguly as Niharika Basu (Meghna's Step Mother) * Deepankar De as Dr. Chittaranjan Basu (Meghna's Father) * Reeta Basu Meghna's Mother * Silajit Majumder as Siddhartha Roy, the Singer * Saheb Chatterjee as Shantanu * Anindita Bose as Shreya * Biswajit Chakraborty as Police Officer * Soumitra Chatterjee as Colonel Samaresh Bagchi (guest appearance) * Sabitri Chatterjee as Jhulon Gupto (guest appearance) * Sabyasachi Chakrabarty as Dhomoni Ghosh (guest appearance) * Srijit Mukherji as Doyal Khashnobish (guest appearance) * Bratya Basu as Raktim Ganguly (guest appearance) * Barun Chanda as Trenlet Biswas (guest appearance) * Raj Chakraborty as Setu Venkataraman (guest appearance) * Indranath Mukherjee as the effeminate history professor * Akshay Kapoor as Invigilator/ Sign Language Interpreter * Reetabrata Ghosh as Gun case * Sudeshna Roy as Shikha Dhor (guest appearance) * Sohag Sen as Miss Cella Neous (guest appearance) * Priyanka Sarkar as Hiya (guest appearance) * Jeet in a (special appearance) ==Music== The soundtrack is composed Anupam Roy and Indraadip Dasgupta. ==Reception and recognition== The film received generally positive reviews by critics.

She lives and works in Los Angeles and maintains a studio in Culver City, California. Her work has been exhibited in galleries in London, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto and Barcelona and is characterized by an expressive application of color, as well as rich textures and movement. To date, Ferreira has participated in 40 exhibitions, has had her work sold at Christie's Auction House in Beverly Hills, exhibited during the 55th Biennale in Venice, Italy and has been featured in publications such as BlackBook, Fabrik Magazine, The Malibu Times, h Magazine, Luxe Interiors + Design, InStyle, Haute Living, In Touch Weekly and Esquire. She was also art chair of BritWeek from 2009‚Äì2010 and maintains active involvement in the event. Emma was named among the top 100 Inspirational women from Buckinghamshire alongside Amal Clooney, Kate Winslet and Queen Elizabeth by Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Life today Magazine in 2015. Enter Eden ; Apple G4 cube redesigned, part of TROMI collection The sculpture titled Enter Eden; it is homage to Apple Inc. and its founder, Steve Jobs. Ferreira is the founder of the brand TROMI (The Reality of my Illusion), Concept House Inc, The Concept Box and The Concept Collection. ==Personal life== Born in Buckinghamshire, England, Ferreira grew up as an only child. Her mother is English and her father is of half-Indian, half-Caribbean descent. At a very early age Ferreira decided that she wanted to experience life outside her rural surroundings, this decision led her to later drop out of art school and succumb to her desire to travel. In an interview with Ann Tsang, owner of publishing company, The Antithesis Collective, Ferreira states that whilst she believes education to be invaluable, she considers travelling as \\"the best form of education a person can have.\\" Moreover, Ferreira credits her journey as a traveller as the \\"force behind [the] creativity and the visions that inspire her work.\\" Ferreira has been living in Los Angeles since 1998. She received formal training at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Otis College of Art and Design and studied photography at Santa Monica College. It was this course in photography that sparked Ferreira's interest in the medium once more. ==Career and work== Through her use of mixed media such as acrylics, metallic paints, resins and mementos from her personal archives, Ferreira has successfully seized critics and collectors' attention in a relatively short amount of time. In an interview with Fabrik, Ferreira notes her desire to capture energy as the impetus for her artwork and attributes her awareness of this human energy to her success. Her work has been purchased by numerous corporations and has procured a substantial private and celebrity list of collectors that includes musicians, film stars and producers. Ferreira's first photographic art show in Los Angeles took place at the Terrell Moore Gallery and was edited by noted photographer Bob Richardson, father of Terry Richardson. TROMI (The Reality of my Illusion) TROMI is Ferreira's most recent installation, the term, which stands for \\"The Reality of my Illusion\\", has also become the artist's brand. The ethos surrounding her latest work, as stated by Ferreira, is the notion that our dreams can effectively be transformed into a reality granted we take advantage of the circumstances at our disposal; these circumstances, as she delineates them, are freedom, choice and desire. In much the same vein as existentialism, TROMI, as a philosophy, addresses our personal freedom above all and highlights our responsibility to give life meaning and carry out our desires with the utmost passion. Ferreira has translated this concept artistically through her marriage of mixed media and photography. By way of a unique method of printing photographs onto materials such as acrylic-plexi or glass and through another process of layering translucent panels, in a way that allows the subject to be suspended and viewed from both sides, Ferreira produces an aesthetic that has been described as light and possessing a dream-like quality. The technical process employed in the TROMI art series is called \\"Layerism\\" and \\"Translayerism\\", both words which the artist has coined. Layerism & Translayerism Layerism encompasses most of Ferreira's artistic work. It refers to a technique of layering various mediums such as flat or textured sheets of paper containing words, phrases, and/or images. The materials are layered on top of one another to create an effect that marks the composite space between what Ferreira deems as precision and spontaneity. However, Layerism is not limited to any specific medium; any item that can be layered on top of each other to create a composition can create a layerism style. Translayerism marks the synthesis of translucency and Layerism. Whilst encompassing the style and technique of Layerism, Translayerism differs subtly with the additional element of transparency. This juxtaposition allows for space and the free movement of both light and energy within it. Layering has become a metaphor to life for Ferreira. The artist believes that just as her work is composed of numerous layers so too is our existence. Moreover, the addition of transparent and translucent elements symbolises the space between those very same layers of our life. Incidentally, Ferreira refers to herself as both a layerist and a translayerist. Kiss of the Gypsy Photograph from Kiss of the Gypsy Kiss of the Gypsy, the title Ferreira has given to her current project, is a coffee table book, and a worldwide art show, featuring photographic images shot in hotel rooms from around the world. The name of the book is taken from the eponymous myth that tells the story of how a single kiss from a gypsy has the power to change the recipient's perception. The extent of this transformation, however, depends upon the individual's willingness to believe in the power of the kiss. The book's artistic elements follow the same premise as Ferreira's TROMI installation. Kiss of the Gypsy examines the artist's notion that exploration is the key to living and that freedom, desire and intention all play a vital role. The photographs in this collection are shot by Ferreira and feature the artist as subject; the images are executed through a style that she has developed herself wherein motion is added by simultaneously having the camera and the subject move physically.

In 1654, his father conveyed to him the bulk of the estate, worth ¬£1,200 p.a. including the manor of Milborne Port while Milborne was on bad terms with his stepmother and her family. Milborne entered Middle Temple in 1658 in the chambers of his uncle Henry Milborne. He was commissioner for assessment for Monmouthshire in January 1660 and commissioner for militia in March 1660. In April 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Milborne Port for the Convention Parliament. History of Parliament Online - William Milborne Milborne never married and died at the age of about 27 at his uncle's chambers at Middle Temple. Milborne was the half-brother of Clayton Milborne. ==References== Category:1633 births Category:1660 deaths Category:English MPs 1660 Category:English landowners Category:Members of the Middle Temple ","title":"William Milborne"},{"id":"35280428","text":"David T. Hon (born 1941) is a Hong Kong-born American physicist, inventor and entrepreneur. He is best known as the inventor and founder of Dahon folding bicycles. Dahon has since grown to become the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer and marketer of folding bikes with Hon still CEO to this day. Dr. David T. Hon, founder and CEO of Dahon, receives and award from Jack Oortwijn, Editor in Chief of Bike Europe ==Early life== Born 1941, Hon hails from a poor family from Hong Kong. From the age of 13 through to 18 he worked part-time as an illustrator for his parents‚Äô clothing workshop. He received a scholarship to attend, and graduated from, the prestigious Anglican-run Diocesan Boys' School in 1959 and the family moved to the U.S. soon afterwards. Hon graduated from UC, Berkeley in 1964, with a BA in Physics and at UCLA‚Äôs Physics Department, obtained the highest score in the Ph.D. candidacy exam in 1967. Whilst still a doctoral candidate he taught as Assistant Professor of Physics at Cal Poly State U in San Luis Obispo, and, later, as Sr. Lecturer at USC. He went on to complete his thesis as an NSF and NASA scholar at USC where he received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1971. ==Career == Hon‚Äôs career in physics truly started when he took up employment at Hughes Aircraft Company, Los Angeles, one of the world‚Äôs leading aerospace corporations. His work focused in particular on the research and development of tactical lasers. In his early years he became known for his work on high power laser frequency doubling, quickly reaching the level of Section Head and Senior Physicist. He became a coauthor in the internationally used Laser Handbook (North Holland Press, 1979). In 1977 Hon was drafted into the highly regarded Hughes Research Labs in Malibu. With greater freedom in research choices, this facility is where he began to focus on the pursuit of lasers for nuclear fusion. By 1980 he had discovered and published a novel technique to efficiently compress high-power laser pulses (to attain over ten times the peak powers) by using SBS from a tapered optical fiber. This work has since inspired hundreds of related research projects right up to the present day. The technique is now widespread in laser nuclear fusion, and ground or space-born defense lasers, as well as in other areas of science and engineering where high, peak-power or high quality laser beams are desired. Hon‚Äôs work at Hughes brought about some of the first of his many patents: e.g. US Patents 4,344,042, 4,178,561, 4,019,159 and 4,010,397. == Inventor and entrepreneur == The oil crisis of the 1970s coincided with a gradual realization for Hon that for many technical reasons, laser nuclear fusion as the ultimate clean energy solution may never be achieved in his lifetime. For some years already he had been researching the idea of a truly effective folding bicycle. So in 1981 he parted ways with Hughes Research Labs and became a self-employed entrepreneur for practicable green solutions. Original 1982 Hon Convertible Hon‚Äôs folding bicycle was the result of some 7 years of garage research and invention. When he was satisfied with the end product, he at first steered towards licensing his folding bike to existing big brands. They however, failed to share in his enthusiasm. With faith undimmed, Hon and his brother Henry raised US$2 million from 35 investors through extensive media exposure and founded Dahon North America in 1982 (originally ‚ÄúHon California, Inc‚Äù). Soon after founding the company, Hon decided that to make it more cost effective he would open a factory in Taiwan. He practically moved to the emerging bicycle industry hot-spot to look after operations, while Henry Hon stayed looking after marketing in the U.S. The business took off, in 1985 alone selling over 10,000 bicycles and by 1994 more than 100,000 annually with 60% of the market share. Dahon continued to grow in popularity worldwide among commuters, vacationers and cyclists. ==Present day== Hon has won many international awards and has registered 220+ patents related to foldable bikes, many in Asia where most bikes are produced. A few of these innovations/inventions have become standard features in nearly all folding bikes today. Hon's inventions have been widely copied, both legally and illegally and he has become quite involved in IP protection advocacy. He is currently chairman of the Industrial Intellectual Property Committee of the Shenzhen Federation of Industrial Economics, has assisted in pushing through legislation that protects foreign companies operating in China and has been published on the subject in China's largest economic journal. In 1995 Dahon opened its ISO 9001 certified factory in Shenzhen, China. The company has since grown to officially become the world‚Äôs largest producer of folding bikes,Guinness World Records 2000 Millennium Edition, 2000, p. 301 turning out about half a million units a year with over 5 million bikes sold to date, mostly under its own brands. Dahon today operates seven factories or subsidiaries in three continents. Hon remains CEO while still contributing inventions and designs. In 2013, Dr. David Hon was furthermore nominated for UC Berkeley Excellence in Achievement Award for his \\"contributions in high- powered lasers as well as his role in revolutionizing the modern-day folding bicycle.\\" ==Memberships and organizations== * Governor of American Chamber of Commerce of South China * Board Member of Light Electric Vehicle Association (LEVA) * Associate Member of A-Team, Taiwan * Board Member of China Bicycle Association * Vice Chairman of Guangdong Bicycle Association * Chairman of the Industrial Intellectual Property Committee of the Shenzhen Federation of Industrial Economics * Committee Member of the H.M.

She is an American television producer known for her work on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful and for her involvement in various social issues. She was appointed United States Ambassador to Hungary by United States President Barack Obama and took office on January 21, 2015. ==Early life and education== Bell (n√©e Bradley) was born in 1967 in Evanston, Illinois, to Sheila, an interior designer, and Edward Bradley, a lawyer. Bell studied economics and political science at Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Virginia, and graduated in 1989 with a bachelor's degree. ==Producing career== Bell's television career began in 1991 at Bell-Phillip Television Productions, the production company for the CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. Bell served in various roles for the show, including script supervisor and director of special projects. After leaving the show in 2000, she returned several years later as special projects director, and in 2011 led a project to overhaul and update all the fashion on the show, a critical aspect of production because the plot focuses on two rival fashion houses. She became a full producer in 2012. As producer, Bell has received three Daytime Emmy Award nominations when The Bold and the Beautiful was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series in 2013, 2014 and 2015. ==Issues advocacy, philanthropy and political involvement== Bell is active in issues advocacy and philanthropy. In 2007, she met with Senator Barbara Boxer about global warming as part of a delegation from the Leadership Council, a Los Angeles County environmental issues group. In 2010 Bell was named to President Barack Obama's Advisory Committee on the Arts, and in 2011 she was elected chairperson. Obama appointed Bell to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Board of Trustees in 2012. Additionally, she has served as a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Los Angeles Music Center and vice chairperson of the Children's Institute Inc.. Bell is also active in the Democratic Party, and served as an at-large delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a \\"bundler\\", Bell helped raise more than $2.1 million for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign. In February 2012, Bell and her husband, The Bold and the Beautiful executive producer and head writer Bradley Phillip Bell, hosted a fundraiser for Obama at their home with actor Will Ferrell and his wife, Viveca Paulin. Bell also sits on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council. ==Ambassadorship== Appointment and confirmation On November 6, 2013, President Obama nominated Bell to succeed Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis as ambassador to Hungary. Bell was one of three ambassadorial nominees who, according to the Washington Post, came to \\"symbolize the problems with giving plum overseas diplomatic assignments to big political donors\\". Senator John McCain questioned Bell's lack of diplomatic experience and knowledge of Hungary. In an article for Politico, James Bruno, a former U.S. career foreign service officer, noted that Bell \\"could not answer questions about the United States' strategic interests in Hungary\\". When asked during questioning about American interests in the nation, Bell \\"stumbled and stammered\\", replying \\"the security relationship and also the law enforcement and to promote business opportunities, um, increase trade, um\\". Senator Barbara Boxer supported Bell, noting her intelligence and ability to \\"make friends\\". The Senate confirmed Bell in a 52-42 vote on December 2, 2014, and she was sworn in on December 16. Work as ambassador On January 19, 2015, Bell arrived in Budapest, ending the 18-month absence of an American ambassador which had existed since Kounalakis departed in July 2013. Bell presented her credentials to President J√°nos √Åder of Hungary on January 21, 2015. In February 2015, Bell signed an agreement that, pending ratification by both countries' legislatures, would end dual taxation of U.S. and Hungarian citizens. Speaking at an event held by the American Chamber of Commerce that month, Bell told a forum that transparency and predictability regarding Hungarian business laws and regulations are needed to attract U.S. investors to the country. Also in February, Bell spoke in support of Ukrainian sovereignty during the ongoing conflict between Ukraine, which is Hungary's northeastern neighbor, and Russia. Bell's comments in support of Ukraine were notable because her remarks to diplomats from NATO member states came as Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting Budapest. As the European migrant crisis unfolded in 2015, with people from Syria fleeing that country's Syrian Civil War, Hungary saw the largest spike of migrants per capita from January to June. By October 2015, Hungary had responded by blocking its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia to prevent the influx of migrants. Bell spoke to the press on September 30, stating that her embassy staff had been in regular contact with the Hungarian government, non-governmental organizations and the public on the migrant issue. According to Bell, in addition to information sharing and logistical help, her office gave direct aid to organizations such as the Hungarian Red Cross. While acknowledging that Hungary's sovereignty allows it to choose how to secure its borders, she stated that the U.S. \\"promote[s] the humane treatment of refugees\\". She was also critical of Hungarian \\"anti-immigration rhetoric\\" in the media, stating that it \\"doesn't represent the Hungarian people\\". In October 2015 Bell spoke at Corvinus University of Budapest, and praised Hungary's efforts to support the Ukraine during its conflict with Russia. In addition, she expressed appreciation for Hungary's partnership with the United States and its allies in the areas of counter-terrorism and law enforcement, and called for greater economic cooperation between the U.S. and Hungary. She also expressed concern over recent, potentially unfavorable developments in Hungary, including government corruption, a decline in press freedoms, and negative stereotypes with regard to refugees from Syria. Bell's speech attracted significant media attention, raising her profile in the international community. Ambassador Bell reached out to Hungarian society through her Instagram page, documenting her travels across Hungary. Ambassador Bell visited several national parks in Hungary. Bell was awarded the Commanders Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit for her work in strengthening the bilateral relationship between Hungary and the United States. Ambassador Bell served until January 20, 2017 as the United States Ambassador to Hungary. ==Personal life== On October 4, 1991, Bell married Bradley Phillip Bell, the son of Lee Phillip Bell and William J. Bell, at St. Athanasius Roman Catholic Church in Evanston, Illinois. The Bells have four children, daughters Charlotte and Caroline and sons Chasen and Oliver , and live in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. ==References *U.S. Department of State biography * Category:1967 births Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Hungary Category:American women diplomats Category:Television producers from Illinois Category:Businesspeople from Evanston, Illinois Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Living people Category:Sweet Briar College alumni Category:Women in Illinois politics Category:American women television producers Category:People from Holmby Hills, Los Angeles ","title":"Colleen Bell"},{"id":"35280496","text":"Slovak (originally known as Slovactown or Slovaktown) is an unincorporated community in Prairie County, Arkansas, United States.

It is bringing composting technology to a country where the common practice is by open dumping of waste, as there are no landfills. This project is the first public-private partnership project in Pakistan on a large scale in the area of Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSW). It will contribute towards the sustainable development of the municipality of Lahore, as well as significantly reduce health hazards for the local communities. It was set up at Mehmood Booti under an agreement with the City District Government of Lahore (CDGL). The project is expected to generate over 310,000 tons of CO2e by 2018. ==Reasoning behind the facility== The rapid increase of population, high rates of migration towards cities, as well as the introduction of disposable items, such as plastic bags and bottles have created serious environmental problems including: inadequate solid and liquid waste management, lack of safe water and minimal pollution control. Similar to other big cities of Pakistan, Lahore is witnessing a rapid growth in its population due to rural-urban migration from the surrounding areas and other parts of the country. Lahore has a population of around 10 million and is considered to be one of the 30 largest cities in the world. Open dumping carries serious environmental effects The increase in population has exerted immense pressure on the social and physical infrastructure of the city, leading to various socio-economic and environmental problems. Inadequate solid waste management is one of the most visible and pressing problems in the city, contributing to an unattractive environment, poor sanitation, disease, pollution of water bodies and general environmental degradation. Due to its high population growth and the lack of resources, waste management has become a challenge for the city. This project addresses the need to dispose of solid waste in economically beneficial ways without putting an extra burden on the infrastructure of Lahore city . Addressing the lack of facilities The country has no scientifically designed landfill and the common practice is for the open dumping of waste. LCL has leased the Mehmood Booti dumping site from CDGL as well as receiving a concession from it to process 1,000 tons per day (tpd) of MSW collected from residential areas, as well as from the city's fruit and vegetable markets. LCL has imported Belgian machinery and composting technology. LCL has created local compost management know-how through the practice of learning by doing, which did not exist previously. Composting in a scientifically designed plant will improve the local environment, reducing the health hazards created by the present practices of dumping waste in open sites. It will also sequester the emission of methane gas generated in the process of anaerobic decomposition of the bio-degradable matter. the project will also lengthen the usable life of the dump site in a city where land is running short and its costs are at a premium. The compost that is produced will be used as a soil conditioner/fertilizer for improving the quality of the soil in and around Lahore. All manner of vegetable waste can be used from markets ==Addressing various issues== Declining land yields and soil erosion are big large problems in Pakistan, especially for an agriculturally based country. This is exacerbated by the fact that Pakistan has been estimated to be one of the 12 hardest hit countries by climate change, the highest impact being on agriculture and floodings. The Lahore Compost project is not only a pilot for better a MSW in the country, but also represents a potential solution for badly degraded agricultural lands. Compost application pilots are already showing positive effects in reducing land salinity, which is a big problem in Pakistan. In addition, land yields and the size of agricultural products produced have been shown to increase dramatically with the first application of compost to degraded soils. In addition to selling Certified Emission Reduction (CER), the project must also create a market for compost in the country. Added benefits In addition to mitigating climate change, LCL has created jobs through this project. It has implemented free vaccinations for its workers, showers where they can wash after work, introduced safety measures like the mandatory use of safety boots and gloves and it is working on creating an education program through its project. Forecast CDM revenues are expected to encourage the development of a market for compost in Pakistan, where it has not yet been operating on a larger scale. Lahore Compost will demonstrate the viability of such an initiative and encourage the private sectors participation in similar MSW projects, which will help contribute towards the sustainable development of other municipalities in Pakistan.

As of April 1, 2013, MiWay and Brampton Transit have equal cash fares, both being $3.50, hence a one-way trip also costs $3.50, regardless of distance travelled. For TransHelp users, in order to have a TransHelp account, new registrants will have to prepay at least $32.50, which is equivalent to 10 one-way trips.

The company was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 2011, it moved to Oregon, and in 2015 moved to San Ramon, California. Mark Schwartz was the company's president and chief executive officer. As of December 29, 2017, the company was acquired by Sellas Life Sciences Group Ltd. through a reverse merger transaction. Galena Biopharma was renamed to Sellas Life Sciences Group, Inc (). ==History== In November 2006, Argonaut Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed the name to RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation. RXi was a subsidiary of CytRx Corp., which provided $15 million in financing in April 2007. RXi was founded in part by Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello. In September 2007, RXi signed a licensing deal with TriLink Biotechnologies, a competitor in the RNA interference (RNAi) field, in which RXi would pay TriLink to use three of TriLink's technologies. In March 2011, the company announced the planned acquisition of Arizona-based Apthera, Inc. for $7 million. The acquisition included the breast cancer drug NeuVax. In June 2011, NeuVax was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to start a stage three clinical trial. In September 2011, the company separated its cancer therapies division. It was renamed Galena Biopharma Inc and moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon. RXi became a subsidiary of Galena and retained RNAi technologies. RXi Pharmaceuticals remained in Massachusetts as a publicly traded company. In January 2014, Galena bought Mills Pharmaceuticals. In April 2014, the company headquarters moved to Portland. In November 2011, the company partnered with Genentech to combine drugs from each company for a cancer treatment. Galena is currently studying the combination of NeuVax and Herceptin in phase II trials.  Leadership  In March 2011, president and CEO Noah Beerman was replaced by Mark Ahn, and in August 2014, Ahn resigned and was replaced by Mark Schwartz. On January 31, 2017, Galena announced the resignation of Mark Schwartz effective that day, and reported in the same press release that it would be exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward.  Stock  RXi went public in March 2008. CytRx retained 49% ownership of RXi's stock and gave shares of RXi to existing shareholders. Trading began on the NASDAQ market on March 12, 2008, under the ticker symbol of RXII. Fidelity Investments invested $8.5 million in the company in May 2008, followed by a $25 million private-equity investment by Yorkville in February 2009. In 2010, RXi received a National Institutes of Health grant of $600,000. By August 2010, the company had 30 employees. In April 2011, RXi raised about $12 million from a stock offering and received $580,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health. The company reported a loss of $11.5 million loss for 2011. In November 2012, an anonymous internet report caused Galena stock to decline. The company filed a lawsuit claiming the report was false and attempted to manipulate the stock. In 2014, Galena's involvement in a fraudulent stock promotion scheme was exposed. On February 1, 2014, analyst Matt Gravitt published an article that revealed Galena had paid MissionIR, DreamTeam brand, to promote Galena's stock. Galena's stock fell 20% following this revelation that received a heated response, and was one of the three most read articles in Seeking Alpha's history. Over the next few weeks, more revelations came out and the company admitted their stock promotion relationship and insider selling. Galena then disclosed that the SEC was investigation their relationship with The DreamTeam Group. By March 2014, five lawsuits were filed against Galena and several of its officers alleging that the company used misleading articles to boost stock prices. Motley Fool, discussing the 23% stock price drop during March 2015, noted there was stock dilution from the offering and also that Abstral's sales were below Galena's estimates from late 2013. Discussing the Motley Fool article, Portland Business Journal also noted the ongoing insider-trading lawsuits as a factor in the stock price. A few days later, Zacks Investment Research said Galena could be a \\"great candidate\\" to beat its earnings. In response, Galena's CEO said there were many positive aspects to the company, and that the lawsuits weren't a worry as they should get covered under Directors and officers liability insurance. The company moved to San Ramon, California, in the Bay Area in 2015.  Stock promotion scandal  The revelation that Galena was engaging in fraudulent stock promotion without adequate disclosure led to the investigation of other biotech companies who engaged in similar activities. Richard Pearson, an investor who went undercover to investigate the stock promotion firms, wrote an expos√© on DreamTeam and its ties to articles about Galena, CytRx and other companies on media websites. In April 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced enforcement actions against 27 individuals and entities behind various alleged stock promotion schemes. Fraud charges were filed against three public companies, seven stock promotion or communications firms, and two company CEOs; also on this hit list are six individuals and nine writers.  Merger with Sellas Life Sciences  In 2017, Galena Biopharma Inc. announced a merger \\"with privately held oncology company Sellas Life Sciences Group Ltd. in an all-stock transaction.\\" The combined company was Sellas Life Science Group. The newly merged companies focused on the development of novel treatments for cancer. == Products == Galena acquired the experimental breast cancer drug NeuVax in 2011 and are currently in phase II trials to combine the drug with Genentech's Herceptin. In 2013, Galena began selling its first developed drug, an analgesic for cancer pain named Abstral Sublingual. Anagrelide controlled-released (GALE-401) was approved by the FDA for phase III clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis in December 2016. GALE-301 and GALE-302 are immunotherapies in phase I and II trials for ovarian and breast cancers. ==References== Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Companies based in San Ramon, California Category:Pharmaceutical companies of the United States Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 2006 Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Biotechnology companies established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Health care companies based in California Category:2008 initial public offerings Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Galena Biopharma"},{"id":"35280827","text":"Cucumber green spider may refer to one of several species of spider in the genus Araniella including: *Araniella cucurbitina *Araniella opisthographa Category:Set indices on spiders ","title":"Cucumber green spider"},{"id":"35280848","text":"The following list includes notable people who were born or have lived in Bath, Maine. == Authors and academics == *Robert Jaffe, physicist * McDonald Clarke, poet * Alice May Douglas, poet and author * George F.

It was one of the great centres of Early Netherlandish (or 'Flemish') painting. Robert Campin settled there and attracted students including Rogier Van Der Weyden and Jacques Daret. It also produced the important Franco-Flemish composers Pierre de la Rue and Marbrianus de Orto. The Tournaisis was situated between two larger neighbours: the County of Flanders, and the County of Hainaut. Its origins lie in a Roman pagus within the civitas of the Menapii, of which it became the chief city in late Roman times. It had some independence and power in the Middle Ages because it became the seat of the Bishopric of Tournai. The territory, like that of Flanders, but unlike neighbouring Hainaut, was part of early medieval West Francia, which evolved into France. However, this rule was not always effective. It came under French rule during the reign of Philip IV of France, and remained under French control until it was conquered by Emperor Charles V in 1521. It remained part of the Habsburg Netherlands until 1789, eventually becoming part of modern Belgium. The Tournaisis was considered part of the Seventeen Provinces.

This Imambara is the largest one in India and Bengal. == Construction == leftthumb A painting of the Nizamat Fort Campus with the old Nizamat Imambara at extreme right just behind the boat and the other surrounding buildings which include the grand Hazarduari Palace (c. 1830s - 1840s), painting by William Prinsep.  Old Nizamat Imambara  The old Nizamat Imambara was built by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in the Nizamat Fort Area. He bought bricks and mortar, and laid the foundation of the building with his own hands. However, the old Imambara was primarily made up of wood. The plot where this Imambara had been built was dug to a depth of 6 feet. It was refilled with soil which was brought from Mecca so that the poor members of the Muslim community could have an experience of Hajj.  Destruction  The old Imambara which caught fire for the first time in 1842 and was partly destroyed. But it was completely destroyed by a fire on 23 December 1846. That day the Nawabs along with the Europeans threw a party to celebrate the weaning ceremony of five-year-old Hassan Ali Mirza. The Imambara caught fire at midnight due to the fireworks left off and was completely burnt down. Nothing survived except the old Madina Mosque.  New Nizamat Imambara  leftthumb The Nizamat Imambara. The new Imambara was built in 1847 by Nawab Nazim Mansur Ali Khan under the supervision and direction of Sadeq Ali Khan just opposite the Hazarduari Palace at a cost of more than 6 lacs. The main entrance just parallel to the north face of the Hazarduari Palace faces south. The masons took only 11 months to finish the construction as in addition to their wages they also received food which allowed them to work day and night. The present Imambara is 680 feet long, however the breadths vary. The central block that has the Madina is 300 feet long. It had been built slightly some feet away from the site of the old building in north. The Imambara stands just opposite to the Hazarduari Palace and is situated just on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. The gap between the shores of the river and the west wall of the Imambara may be a few feet. The old Madina Mosque was left as it was and a new one was constructed in the newly constructed Imambara. The old Madina Mosque can still be seen standing between the new Imambara and the Hazarduari Palace near the Bacchawali Tope and the Clock Tower of Murshidabad. thumb An old photo on the main entrance of the Nizamat Imambara, just opposite the Hazarduari Palace. Panoramic view of Nizamat Imambara, Murshidabad The present Imambara has been divided into three large quadrangles as follows: * The central quadrangle has the Madina Mosque and the Memberdalan. * The eastern quadrangle has the Naubat Khana. * The western quadrangle has a two-storied Mosque. The mosque stands on the Mint Ghat and rises almost from the Bhagirathi River as the distance may be a few feet. The Memberdalan, which means hall for members, is a hall rather a corridor just beside the Madina Mosque. It has a pulpit and to recite an elegy. The hall also has a verandah.

In Season 1, the rounds were divided into challenges to create Frozen, Baked and Chocolate desserts and also an electronic voice told them their inspiration and ingredients for the round. In the following seasons, the format was changed to Chocolate, Candy and Cake and the electronic voice was taken out. At the beginning of each round, Chef Ben-Israel reveals the first mandatory ingredient followed by an inspiration. The second mandatory ingredient is revealed at the halfway point of each round. On rare occasions, a third ingredient is introduced. The time limit goes from 40 minutes in the first round, 50 minutes in the second round, and then an hour in the final round.

It offers members examinations, courses, and awards. The guild is a fellowship of those who sincerely desire to offer the best in music to the service of the church: amateur and professional musicians unified in a common ideal. The Guild was founded in 1888 as the Church Choir Guild. It was incorporated in 1905 to become known as the Incorporated Guild of Church Musicians. The founding patrons were Archbishop Frederick Temple and Sir George Elvey, organist of St George‚Äôs Chapel, Windsor. Although the organization was mainly Anglican since its founding, in 1988 in the Centenary Year of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster was invited to become a joint patron, and the Guild's openness to all branches of the Christian Church was affirmed. ==Examinations== Since 1961, the Guild has been charged with the responsibility of administering and examining for the Archbishop of Canterbury's Certificate in Church Music. After 1988, the Certificate was renamed The Archbishops' Certificate in Church Music, incorporating the Archbishop of Westminster's patronage. The Guild now offers five levels of professional awards plus a preliminary award for young people new to church music. * Archbishop's Preliminary Certificate in Church Music: a basic qualification for younger people * Archbishop's Award in Church Music: a lower professional qualification consisting only of the practical part of the ACertCM exam. * Archbishop's Certificate in Church Music (ACertCM): open to all who have a serious interest or involvement in the music of the Christian Church, whether as choir directors, organists or keyboard players, choir singers, instrumental leaders, instrumentalists, worship leaders (cantors/animateurs), or in any similar capacity. * Archbishop's Certificate in Public Worship (ACertPW): designed particularly to encourage and assist those with responsibility for public worship in all Christian denominations. It is open to any current member of the Guild who has, or who seeks, responsibility for animating and presiding at public worship within the Church. * Licentiate of The Guild of Church Musicians (LGCM): awarded to those who have completed Part I of the FGCM irrespective of whether they proceed to the Fellowship. * Fellowship of The Guild of Church Musicians (FGCM): taken via modular, distance learning, it is the highest qualification awarded by the Guild. It is intended for all musicians who work within the Christian Church, regardless of denomination. The Fellowship course aims to train and develop church musicians to be able to work with understanding and at a high standard. ==Leadership== Patrons * The Archbishop of Canterbury * The Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster President * Dame Mary Archer Vice Presidents * Richard Fenwick * Richard Hurford OAM * Alan Luff * Philip Matthias * Anthony Russell * Frank Sellens The Guild leadership also includes: * a thirteen member Council which comprises several administrative officers, * a board of Honorary Advisors, and * an Academic Board.

(). Co- founder of the company, Wanhua Group Corporation ( or ), initially owned 93.25% shares. The company started its initial public offering in December 2000. The shares started to trade in the Shanghai Stock Exchange in January 2001. Initially, the listed company only owned the methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) production line of the former Yantai synthetic leather factory. It was a common practice at that time to list part of the assets instead of the whole conglomerate. The size of the listed company expanded beyond that assets, however. That MDI production line was replaced by a new one in 2014, also located in Yantai. The company also imported technology from Honeywell for its Yantai plant in 2018. In 2017, the shares of the listed company became a constituent of the blue-chip index SSE 50. In February 2019, the listed company acquired Hungarian company BorsodChem and other assets, via a reverse merger with the largest shareholder of the listed company in an all- share deal that worth RMB52 billion. In July 2019, the listed company acquired Swedish company Chematur Technologies for a reported US$134 million from Jilin-based Kangnaier Investment Group (; also transliterated as Connell Chemical Industry LLChttp://www.jilinconnell.com) and another investor. In the same month, the listed company formed a shipping joint venture with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). ==Businesses== Wanhua Chemical Group is one of the largest chemical producers of the world. According to Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN;), the listed company is ranked the 37th in 2018 edition of the ranking, up from the 41st in 2017 edition. As of 2019, it is the world's largest producer of the polyurethane raw material methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). According to another source, the listed company is the second largest producer of the world for aliphatic diisocyanate (ADI) as well as the largest producer of China for toluene diisocyanate (TDI). The company is ranked the 820th in 2019 edition of Forbes Global 2000. On top of the production facility in Yantai, the company also has factories in Ningbo, Zhuhai and Meishan. Since 2019, the company expanded into Hungary. The company also announced a plan to build a factory in Convent, Louisiana, the US in November 2018. However, C&EN; and SCMP reported that the plan may be revised in 2019. The proposal plant also faced opposition from the local residents of Convent as well as change in costs due to multiple factors, such as tariff of raw material due to the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war. BorsodChem In February 2011, the parent company of the listed company, Wanhua Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (), acquired Hungarian chemical maker BorsodChem for a reported US$1.66 billion (‚Ç¨1.2 billion). The parent company also hired the listed subsidiary to manage BorsodChem from 2011 to 2019. In February 2019, Wanhua Chemical Group made a reverse merger with its direct parent company at that time, . That company also owned the shares of BorsodChem. ==Shareholders== The parent company and largest shareholder of the listed company was Yantai-city government owned Wanhua Group Corporation in 1998. From 2003, Wanhua Group Corporation's non wholly owned subsidiary Wanhua Industrial Group became the direct parent company, which was the largest shareholder until January 2018. In January 2018, the parent company was split into two companies: Wanhua Industrial Group and (). The latter became the new largest shareholder of the listed company instead. At that time, that company owned 47.92% shares of Wanhua Chemical Group. However, in February 2019, the listed company merged with its largest shareholder, with the listed company is the surviving entity. Another company, Yantai Guofeng (), became the new largest shareholder of the listed company for 21.56% stake since February 2019 and increased to 21.59% as of 31 December 2019. Yantai Guofeng is owned by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the Yantai Municipal People's Government. Yantai's SASAC also indirectly owned the former parent company of the listed company, Wanhua Industrial Group, at the same time. Yantai Guofeng owned 39.497% stake of Wanhua Industrial Group since 2017. Yantai Guofeng also formed a shareholders' agreement with the third and fourth largest shareholder of the listed company, which they were owned by the managers and employees of the listed company directly and indirectly. As of 31 December 2019, the third () and fourth largest shareholder () owned 10.52% and 9.61% shares respectively. Prime Partner International Limited, a consortium founded in 2007 by Pemex, Deutsche Bank and one other investor, was the second largest shareholder of the listed company, as of 2019, for 10.70% shares. However, the direct parent company of that consortium, had changed to Dao Sheng (Hong Kong) Limited in 2017.

The caste is traditionally associated with the distillation of liquor, but around the start of the 20th century assorted Kalwar caste organisations sought to leave that trade and redefine their community. ==History== Because their hereditary occupation of distilling and selling liquor was considered degrading, the Kalals held a very low status in the traditional caste hierarchy of South Asia. This situation changed when the Kalal chief Jassa Singh rose to political power in the 18th century. Jassa Singh styled himself as Ahluwalia after the name of his native village, and established the ruling dynasty of the Kapurthala State. Following Jassa Singh's rise, other Sikh Kalals also adopted Ahluwalia as the name of their caste, and started giving up their traditional occupation. The regulations imposed by the colonial British administration on manufacture and sale of liquor accelerated this process, and by the early 20th century, most Kalals had abandoned their traditional occupation. By this time, Ahluwalias had started claiming Khatri or Rajput origins to enhance their social status. Before the advent of the British rule, the Muslim Kalals also attempted to raise their social status by adopting the Kakezai Pashtun identity. Some of these Kalal-turned-Kakezais, such as the Hoshiarpur family that ruled the Jalandhar Doab in the 1840s, further raised their status by claiming to be high-caste Shaikhs. Like the Sikh Kalals, some Muslim Kalals also claimed Khatri or Rajput origin. Kalwars in Allahabad were claiming themselves to be of the Kshatriya status in the 1890s. During the British rule, the Kalals took up a variety of occupations, including trade, agriculture, army service (especially the Ahluwalias), government service, and law. == See also == *Sanskritisation ==References== Category:Indian castes Category:Social groups of Rajasthan Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh Category:Social groups of Punjab, India Category:Social groups of Punjab, Pakistan Category:Brewing and distilling castes ","title":"Kalwar (caste)"},{"id":"35281325","text":"Miroslav Grigorov (; born 16 January 1982) is a Bulgarian footballer, who currently plays as a goalkeeper for Slivnishki Geroy. == External links == * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Bulgarian footballers Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:PFC Kaliakra Kavarna players Category:PFC Ludogorets Razgrad players Category:PFC Svetkavitsa players Category:PFC Vidima-Rakovski Sevlievo players Category:FC Vereya players Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Miroslav Grigorov"},{"id":"35281328","text":"George Barnes, D.D.

Acoustic jars are ceramic vessels found set into the walls, and sometimes into the sides of cavities beneath the floors, of medieval churches. They are believed to have been intended to improve the sound of singing, and to have been inspired by the theories of Vitruvius . ==History== Tuned bronze vases set in niches were used to modify the acoustics in Greek and Roman theatres. Their use is described by Vitruvius. No original examples survive. In the Middle Ages the idea of the acoustic vessel re-emerged. Examples have been found in around 200 churches, half of them in France. They vary greatly in shape and positioning, but, unlike those described by Vitruvius they are ceramic, and are found enclosed within the fabric of building. The function of the jars was established with the discovery of a reference in the Chronicle of the Celestins of Metz. The chronicler recorded that, in 1432: > on the vigil of the Assumption, after brother Odo le Roy, the prior, had > returned from the before-mentioned general chapter, it was ordered that pots > should be put into the choir of the church of this place, he stating that he > had seen such in a church elsewhere thinking that they made the singing > better, and resound more, they were put up there in one day, by taking as > many workmen as were necessary. Modern experiments have indicated that their effect would have been to absorb the resonance of certain frequencies, rather than to amplify sound. They use of the jars was said to be common in Brittany, and around Clisson, in the Loire Inferieure. In the Clisson area, they were usually found in horizontal rows at a height of about three metres above floor level. In 1859 a correspondent to Archaeologia Cambrensis reported that at Pallet there was \\"a modern chapel, with earthenware vessels inserted in the walls of the choir, expressly for acoustic purposes\\". In England, a set of eleven jars survives high on the chancel walls of St Andrews church at Lyddington, Rutland. At St Peter Mancroft in Norwich two L-shaped trenches accommodating a number of acoustic jars were discovered beneath the wooden floor on which the choir stalls had previously stood. They had rubble walls and concrete bottoms, and the surfaces were rendered over. Earthenware jars were built into the walls at intervals of about three feet, with the mouths facing into the trench. The jars were about 9 ¬Ω inches long, and 8 inches across at their widest, narrowing to 6 inches at the mouth. A similar discovery was made at St Peter Parmentergate, Norwich in the same city. At Fountains Abbey, in Yorkshire several earthenware vessels were discovered mortared into the base of the choir screen, their necks protruding through the stonework. The effectiveness of the medieval jars has sometimes been doubted. The Chronicler of Metz, in the only medieval source for the purpose of the jars, mocks the prior for believing that they might have improved the sound of the choir, and the archaeologist Ralph Merrifield suggested that their use might have owed more to a tradition of votive deposits than to the theories of Vitruvius. In 2011, at The Acoustics of Ancient Theatres conference, held in Patra, Greece, P. Karampatzakis and V. Zafranas presented evidence that Vitruvius' theory was in fact correct, and that the reconstruction of an ancient acoustic vase is possible. Acoustics of Ancient Theatres conference Karampatzakis P.

For the fourth successive year a Queensland victory set a new record for consecutive State of Origin titles, reaching seven. Game I was played at Melbourne's sold out Etihad Stadium and won by Queensland; its television broadcast watched by more than 2.5 million viewers, rating it as the most-watched State of Origin broadcast since the introduction of OzTAM ratings in 1999. New South Wales' series-equalling win in Game II, played at Sydney's sold out ANZ Stadium, set a new TV ratings record for most-watched second game of any series in State of Origin history. The decider, Game III was played at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium and was won by Queensland. This game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001. In 2012, the first year of the independent Australian Rugby League Commission, a new rule was put into place that would set out earlier in a player's career which was his state of origin. For the second successive year, Queensland hosted Game III and New South Wales hosted Game II; typically the states would alternate the hosting of these games. Ricky Stuart stepped down as New South Wales head coach after the series in August, shortly after signing a contract to coach the Parramatta Eels from 2013 onwards. Later in the year New South Wales' player of the series was named: hooker Robbie Farah. 2012 also saw the inaugural Under 20s State of Origin match which was played at Centerbet Stadium, with New South Wales taking out the Darren Lockyer Shield against Queensland. == Game I == The opening game for the New South Wales Blues saw Todd Carney, James Tamou, Tony Williams and Jamie Buhrer make their debuts, with all either having previous international representative or grand final experience. Michael Jennings was the first Origin player in 29 years to be selected to the squad after playing in the reserve grades, where he was dropped from the Penrith Panthers for one game due to poor off-field discipline. Jamie Buhrer from the Manly Sea Eagles was generally the shock selection in the squad, only playing for City Origin earlier in the year as his sole representative honour and was yet to play 50 games for his club, but was selected due to his big game experience, having played in Manly's winning 2011 NRL Grand Final team, and his high utility value to replace their recognised utility in Kurt Gidley who was unable to play in the 2012 series to due a season-long injury. Only 9 of the selected 17 players were incumbent from Game Three in 2011. Queensland's selected side for the first game was largely unchanged from the 2011 series, with only four changes made. Their only debutant was Matt Gillett from the Brisbane Broncos to play a utility role from the bench. It was hooker Cameron Smith's first match and series as the permanent captain for his state, having previously filled in for the role only in Darren Lockyer's absence. 1st half New South Wales held most of the momentum early in the match, and scored first through winger Akuila Uate in the sixth minute of the match, who recovered a bomb kick and scored in the corner; Todd Carney missed the conversion and New South Wales led 4‚Äì0. In the twenty-first minute, a brawl erupted; Blues centre Michael Jennings, who ran some distance to leap into the brawl and punch Brent Tate in the head, was sent to the sin bin for ten minutes. The Maroons scored shortly afterwards, with winger Darius Boyd touching down in the corner and Johnathan Thurston converting to give Queensland a 6‚Äì4 lead. Boyd scored again in the thirty- eighth minute, and another successful conversion from Thurston gave Queensland a 12-4 lead at halftime. 2nd half New South Wales added points early in the second half, with Jennings scoring a try from a bomb kick; Carney's successful conversion brought the score to 12‚Äì10. New South Wales had most of the attack during the second half, but Queensland was able to defend its goal-line and prevent the Blues from scoring; and in the fifty-second minute, Carney narrowly missed a long-range penalty goal attempt which would have levelled the scores at twelve apiece, but after seventy minutes, Queensland still led 12‚Äì10. After a repeat set of six in the seventy-third minute, Maroons' centre Greg Inglis crossed the line in controversial circumstances: after recovering the ball from a cross-field kick, Inglis lost control of the ball when it contacted the boot of Blues' hooker Robbie Farah, before regathering and grounding in goal. After a lengthy review, the video referee awarded a try: he ruled that Farah had intentionally played at and kicked the ball out of Inglis' hands, and that Inglis' loss of control was therefore not a knock-on. The try was converted, and there was no further score, giving Queensland 18‚Äì10 victory. The decision to award the try to Inglis was highly controversial. Blues captain Paul Gallen argued vehemently with the referee onfield following the decision, although was more circumspect after the match. Inglis' controversial try saw him pass Dale Shearer to become the all-time leading try scorer in State of Origin football. Michael Jennings received a one-match suspension for the punch for which he was sin-binned during the match. It was Queensland's fourth Game One victory in a row, the first time either team had achieved the feat. After the controversial Inglis try call, and others during the game, New South Wales coach Ricky Stuart asked his players not to give interviews to media in the lead-up to Game II, although the ban was lifted after two days. The decision was officially endorsed by referees' coach Bill Harrigan the following day. == Game II == The two players to enter the New South Wales squad for the second game of the series were Anthony Watmough and Tim Grant, with Grant making his debut. Grant was included to partner James Tamou as starting props, with captain Paul Gallen moved back to his preferred position at lock and Greg Bird subsequently shifted to second row with Luke Lewis to the bench to replace Jamie Buhrer. Watmough replaces Tony Williams who was not selected due to a sustained injury. The announced Queensland side remained unchanged, however afterwards Sam Thaiday was forced to withdraw due to injury and was replaced by David Taylor, allowing Corey Parker to enter the squad. 1st half Game 2 saw a very physical contest between the two sides. New South Wales dominated possession, and Brett Stewart scored the first try of the game in the corner after around 25 minutes, giving New South Wales a 4‚Äì0 lead. A late converted try by Ben Hannant after a bomb kick was misread by the New South Wales backline saw Queensland lead 6‚Äì4 at half-time. 2nd half Two minutes into the second half, Cooper Cronk was sin-binned for a professional foul which denied Todd Carney the opportunity to score under the posts from a grubber kick; Carney converted a penalty goal to level the scores at 6-6\\\\. Billy Slater and Corey Parker then suffered game-changing injuries as the Maroons struggled to keep up with the Blues' pace. New South Wales scored two quick tries during Cronk's period in the sin bin, with both Brett Stewart scoring a 50-metre try following a break by Carney, and Josh Morris scoring after a break by Jarryd Hayne. Johnathan Thurston had stripped Hayne of the ball which travelled forward, Morris picked the ball up and out paced Greg Inglis in a 40-metre sprint to score; this gave New South Wales a 16‚Äì6 lead. From there, Queensland began to have the better of possession, and won several repeat sets from goal-line dropouts. Greg Inglis scored a try in the 62nd minute, the conversion bringing the score back to 16‚Äì12. Brent Tate almost scored a try in the 70th minute, but Michael Jennings knocked the ball out of his grasp in the in-goal area to save the try. There were no further points in the game, and New South Wales won the game 16-12, to level the series. == Game III == Injury concerns to both squads forced their respective coaches to name extended squads for the decider. Glenn Stewart was the main injury concern for New South Wales, as was Billy Slater likewise for Queensland. Both players were not available for the game. For NSW, Beau Scott replaced the injured Stewart whilst Brett Morris was chosen over Akuila Uate and Tony Williams returned replacing Trent Merrin. Greg Inglis was selected to replace Slater, although Matthew Bowen and Darius Boyd were also considered as replacements. Inglis's centre spot was filled by Dane Nielson whilst Corey Parker took Ashley Harrison's lock position, as Harrison was ruled out from injury. Sam Thaiday returned to the run-on squad and Ben Te'o was considered over David Taylor on the bench. ;1st half New South Wales scored first with a penalty goal by Todd Carney, and then ran in the first try of the match in the 13th minute, scored by Brett Morris and converted by Carney, for an early lead of 8 points to nil. Queensland's Darius Boyd scored out wide after 19 minutes from a cut-out pass from Johnathan Thurston. Thirteen minutes later, from deep in Queensland's half, Thurston broke through an attempted Mitchell Pearce tackle and raced 35m up field before finding Brent Tate and Cooper Cronk in support; two tackles later Thurston accepted an offload from Corey Parker to score close to the posts. New South Wales then kicked the restart into touch on the full and three tackles later Justin Hodges scored a controversial try beside the posts, after calls from New South Wales players for obstruction were denied by the video referee. Thurston converted his own and Hodges' tries, and the score at the half-time break was 16‚Äì8 in favour of the Maroons. ;2nd half Seven minutes into the second half, Brett Stewart pounced on a Robbie Farah grubber kick into the Queensland in-goal and scored his third try of the series for the Blues just before the ball went dead; Carney converted the try to reduce the margin to 16‚Äì14. The next two scores were both Queensland penalty goals kicked by Thurston, one in the 49th minute and one in the 64th minute, to make the score 20‚Äì14. In the 70th minute, Josh Morris scored a try in the corner following a perfectly placed cross-field kick by Robbie Farah, Morris showing great skill to out-jump Darius Boyd and score before sliding into touch; Todd Carney then converted the kick from the sideline to even up the match at 20 points each. Maroons halfback Cooper Cronk kicked a field goal from 40m out to put Queensland ahead by one point with six minutes remaining. Mitchell Pearce then missed a long-range field goal in the final minute to give the Maroons a one-point victory, and their seventh successive State of Origin series victory. Nate Myles was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal for best player in the series while Johnathan Thurston, playing his 24th consecutive Origin match since debut, won his fifth Man of the Match award. Johnathan Thurston's try in the 32nd minute of Game III saw him pass former New South Wales player Michael O'Connor (1985‚Äì91) as the second highest point scorer in Origin history. This game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001, and the 2nd highest OzTam-rated television audience in Australian television history (Games 1 and 2 were the 5th and 6th most watched respectively). This includes a record 421,000 viewership in Melbourne for Game 3, more than all the previous month's Friday Night AFL matches, and up 100,000 from the previous record set for Game 2. == Teams == The 18th & 19th man are reserves to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, do not actually play.

Loose Gounder, who cannot digest that his plan failed, kills one of Gopalakrishnan's calves and the first night is therefore cancelled. One night, Radha sees her husband Gopalakrishnan having a conversation with the flower seller Poovatha. When Radha asks her to explain what happened, Poovatha lies to her that she had sexual intercourse with her husband Gopalakrishnan prior to their marriage.

After finishing Kristiania Commerce School in 1890, Wettre worked office jobs in Norway until 1907, except for the period 1893 to 1899 when he stayed abroad. In 1908 he became a co-owner of the company Peter Thr. Duborgh. From 1929, when William Duborgh died, Wettre was the company's sole owner, and when he died, the company was passed on to Ragnar Wettre. In 1916 he entered the first board of the Scandinavian American Assurance Corporation, together with L. S. Karlsen, Harald Hougen and B. Dreyer.

Stuart was the second son of Archibald Stuart of Torrance in Lanarkshire (died 1767), seventh son and heir of Alexander Stuart of Torrance. His mother, Elizabeth, was daughter of Sir Andrew Myreton of Gogar, bart. He studied law at Edinburgh, and became a member of the Scottish bar. He was employed by James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton, as tutor to his children, and through his influence was in 1770 appointed Keeper of the Signet of Scotland. Stuart was involved in the Douglas Cause in which the Duke of Hamilton disputed the identity of Archibald James Edward Douglas, first baron Douglas, and endeavoured to hinder his succession to the family estates. Stuart was engaged to conduct the case against the claimant. In the course of the suit, which was finally decided in the House of Lords in February 1769 in favour of Douglas, he distinguished himself highly, but so much feeling arose between him and Edward Thurlow (afterwards Lord Thurlow), the opposing counsel, that a duel took place. After the decision of the case Stuart in 1773 published a series of Letters to Lord Mansfield (London, 4to), who had been a judge in the case, and who had very strongly supported the claims of Douglas. In these epistles he assailed Mansfield for his want of impartiality with a force and eloquence that caused him at the time to be regarded as a worthy rival to Junius. From 1777 to 1781 he was occupied with the affairs of his younger brother, Colonel James Stuart (died 1793), who had been suspended from his position by the East India Company for the arrest of Lord Pigot, the governor of the Madras presidency. He published several letters to the directors of the East India Company and to the secretary at war, in which his brother's case was set forth with great clearness and vigour. These letters called forth a reply from Alexander Dalrymple. On 28 October 1774 Stuart was returned to parliament for Lanarkshire, and continued to represent the county until 1784. On 6 July 1779, under Lord North's administration, he was appointed to the Board of Trade in place of Bamber Gascoyne, and continued a member until the temporary abolition of the board in 1782. On 19 July 1790 he re-entered parliament, after an absence of six years, as member for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, for which boroughs he sat until his death. Stuart succeeded to the estate of Torrance on the death of his elder brother, Alexander, without issue, on 23 March 1796 and on the death of Sir John Stuart of Castlemilk, Lanarkshire on 18 January 1797, he succeeded to that property also. In 1798 he published a Genealogical History of the Stewarts (London, 4to), in which he contended that, failing the royal line (the descendants of Stewart of Darnley), the head of all the Stuarts was Stuart of Castlemilk, and that he himself was Stuart of that ilk, heir male of the ancient family. This assertion provoked an anonymous rejoinder, to which Stuart replied in 1799. Stuart died in Lower Grosvenor Street, London, on 18 May 1801, without an heir male. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Stirling of Ardoch, bart. After his death in 1804 she married Sir William Johnson Pulteney, fifth baronet of Wester Hall. By her Stuart had three daughters. The youngest, Charlotte, in 1830 married Robert Harington, younger son of Sir John Edward Harington, eighth baronet of Ridlington in Rutland; through her, on the death of her elder sisters, the estate of Torrance descended to its present [1898] occupier, Colonel Robert Edward Harington-Stuart, while Castlemilk reverted to the family of Stirling- Stuart, descendants of William Stirling of Keir and Cawder, who married, in 1781, Jean, daughter of Sir John Stuart of Castlemilk. Stuart's portrait was painted by Joshua Reynolds and engraved by Thomas Watson. Some notes made by him in July 1789 on charters in the Scottish College at Paris are preserved in the Stowe MSS. at the British Museum, No. 551, f. 56. ==References== *Stuart's Works *Edinburgh Magazine 1801, i. 414 *Gent.

The movie covers Gregory's freshman year. Harry Belafonte stars as coach Eddie Robinson and LeVar Burton (already famous from Roots and later to be known for Reading Rainbow and Star Trek: The Next Generation) appears as Charles 'Tank' Smith, the first friend Jim Gregory makes on the team. The film is directed by Georg Stanford Brown. ==Plot== The movie starts with the recruitment of Gregory as a talented recruit, keen to have the opportunity to go to a school with real NFL credentials, who also opens avenues for funding and recognition for the college. The story deals with issues of race, culture and integration at a critical time in America's history. It ends with grudging acceptance and a positive message ‚Äî although Gregory only actually plays for less than a minute in the final game of the team's division winning season. ==Outside the USA== The movie has enjoyed popularity outside the USA under different titles, usually some version of simply White Tiger. This is because Grambling would be unknown to other audiences and would not be understood in the title. It has been released in Finland under the names Team Tiger and White Tiger. It is particularly well known in Germany under the title Der Kampf der wei√üen Tiger (which translates as, The Struggle of The White Tiger). Movies featuring American Football have a very specific following in Germany.

His paternal grandparents were Guenther XXI. (XXXVIII.) von Schwarzburg-Blankenburg (1450-1484) and Katharina von Querfurt (1452-1521). Over time, G√ºnther united all but one of the Schwarzburg possessions in one hand. He introduced Protestantism in his country and fought on the Protestant side against the emperor in the Schmalkaldic War. G√ºnther benefitted considerably from the political downfall of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin. In feudal matters, he came into conflict with Elector Johann Frederick I, Elector of Saxony. The Elector invaded Schwarzburg and torched the city of Sondershausen. G√ºnther had to flee, and was only able to return after the battle of M√ºhlberg in 1547. To demonstrate his accumulated wealth and power, he largely demolished the existing castle in Sondershausen in 1533 and built a new Renaissance ch√¢teau on the site. This ch√¢teau forms the old North, East and South wings of the current Sondershausen Palace. After his death, the County of Schwarzburg was divided among his four sons. Thus, he became the ancestor of the two lines of the House of Schwarzburg that survived until the 20th century: Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. == Marriage and issue == On 29 November 1528, G√ºnther XL married Elisabeth (d. 14 May 1572), the daughter of Count Philip of Isenburg-B√ºdingen-Ronneburg.

The species was first described by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch in 1875 as Sarotes cervinus. Heteropoda cervina shelters under bark or other dark places during the day, emerging in the evening to find prey, often on tree trunks. These spiders are also known to enter houses, though they are extremely timid, and their bite ‚Äì while painful ‚Äì is only mildly toxic. Their unequally sized legs, after which the genus is named, are splayed to the side allowing very fast sideways movement and abrupt change of direction. They have strong, curved fangs, a flattened body and two rows of four eyes. Males and females look alike, females larger. Females lay their eggs in large \\"cocoons\\". Heteropoda cervina is very similar in appearance to the related species Heteropoda jugulans. There has been a great deal of confusion regarding this species, because of a misidentification of Heteropoda jugulans as Heteropoda cervina by Ramon Mascord (1970, 1980) perpetuated by other authors.Arachne.org.au http://www.arachne.org.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=949 ==References * Category:Sparassidae Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Spiders described in 1875 ","title":"Heteropoda cervina"},{"id":"35282019","text":"Thomas Richardson FRS FRSE MRIA AICE (1816‚Äì1867) was an English industrial chemist, and industrial historian. ==Life== Born on 8 October 1816 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he was educated there. Around 1830 he went to Glasgow University, to study Chemistry under Prof Thomas Thomson. Richardson then went to the University of Giessen, where, under Prof Justus von Liebig, he carried out researches on the composition of coal and the use of lead chromate in organic analysis, gaining a doctorate (Ph.D). He later went to Paris with Thomson, and completed his studies under Jules Pelouze. On his return to Newcastle, Richardson became a specialist in manufacturing chemistry, taking out a number of patents for processes. In 1840 he began, at Blaydon, near Newcastle, to remove the impurities, consisting chiefly of antimony, from \\"hard\\" lead, and thus to convert it into \\"soft\\" lead, by means of a current of air driven over the molten metal; the impurities were oxidised, floated to the surface, and were then skimmed off. Practical improvements introduced into the process by George Burnett soon after led to the annual importation of several thousand tons of Spanish hard lead into the Tyne district, where it was purified. John Percy brought forward evidence that Richardson was not the inventor of this process, quoting a letter from James Leathart, and stating that a patent for it was granted to Walter Hall in 1814. In 1844 Richardson began at Blaydon the manufacture of superphosphates, as suggested by Liebig, and already begun in 1842 in the south of England, by John Lawes. In 1848 he patented a method for condensing \\"lead-fume\\" by means of steam, originally suggested by Richard Watson. In the winter session of 1848 he became lecturer on chemistry in the Newcastle school of medicine and surgery. After the temporary disruption of the school in 1851, he joined the school continued by the majority of the lecturers, which became connected in the same year with the University of Durham. In June 1856 Richardson was made lecturer on chemistry in the university of Durham, and the degree of M.A. was conferred on him by that university. Richardson became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 May 1864, was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1866, and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in the same year. He was also a member of the Royal Irish Academy. Richardson died of apoplexy in Wigan on 10 July 1867. ==Works== With Pelouze he published, in 1838, a research on the action of water on cyanogen and the consequent formation of azulmic acid (i.e. oligomers of hydrogen cyanide that are insoluble in waterUmemoto, Kimiko; Takahasi, Makoto; Yokota, Katsuyuki,Studies on the structure of HCN oligomers (abstract), Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere, Volume 17, Issue 3-4, pp. 283-293.). In 1847, together with Edmund Ronalds, he began to translate Friedrich Ludwig Knapp's Technological Chemistry, which was published between 1848 and 1851. A second edition, in five parts, published in 1855, was rewritten so as to form a new work. Henry Watts replaced Ronalds as Richardson's collaborator for the last three of the five parts; and the book, which was recognised as a standard work, was incorporated by Charles Edward Groves and William Thorp in their Chemical Technology. In 1855, together with Thomas John Taylor, he began to collect information on the history of the chemical industries of the Tyne district. He was helped later by James Cochran Stevenson, R. C. Clapham, and by Thomas Sopwith, and published in collaboration two reports on the subject in the Report of the British Association for 1863. These were incorporated in a book on The Industrial Resources of ‚Ä¶ the Tyne, Wear, and Tees, edited by himself, William Armstrong, Isaac Lowthian Bell, and John Taylor; two editions appeared in 1864. He published, with Armstrong and James Longridge, three major reports (dated 25 August 1857 and 16 January 1858) on the use of the Steam Coals of the Hartley District of Northumberland in Steam-Boilers, addressed to the Steam Collieries Association of Newcastle-on-Tyne.

He was President of the Institute of Chemistry from 1900 to 1903. ==Biography== Thomson was born in the precincts of the old college of Glasgow, the only child of Allen Thomson, professor of anatomyAllen Thomson. cdlr.strath.ac.uk and his wife, Ninian Jane Hill. His family had been connected with the University of Glasgow since 1761, when his great- grandfather, John Millar, was professor of law. Other members of the family held chairs in mathematics, philosophy, medicine and anatomy, pathology, and military surgery at the University of Glasgow or other Scottish universities. Because of the family connections, from early boyhood Thomson was in contact with notable people in academic circles. He regularly accompanied his father on various administrative duties and foreign trips, providing technical assistance and taking notes. This started an interest in architectural matters, which he retained all his life, eventually becoming an accomplished civil architect. He was educated at the Glasgow High School and then studied at the University of Glasgow. He took the usual curriculum in arts, and then entered the faculty of medicine, but later changed to chemistry. He worked in a chemistry laboratory from 1866 to 1871, being appointed assistant to professor Anderson in 1869. In 1868 he came to London to attend demonstrations by William Allen Miller and Charles Loudon Bloxam at King's College London. He returned to Glasgow in 1870 to assume a position of assistant demonstrator with Bloxam in early 1871. However, as the senior demonstrator was seriously ill in those years, Thomson took over his duties and was promoted to senior demonstrator in 1879. From 1880 until 1887, in addition to his work at King's College, he was also lecturing in chemistry at Queen's College and became professor in that college. During that time, he led the Chemical Department at King's College, and carried out many studies on crystallisation and supersaturated solutions. His other contributions were on the composition and properties of ancient glasses, the chemistry of pigments, putrefaction and antisepsis, the chemistry of building materials, and the composition and optical properties of double salts of nickel and cobalt. He co-edited several editions of Bloxam‚Äôs Chemistry, Inorganic and Organic. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880. His proposers were John Young Buchanan, Alexander Crum Brown, Alexander Dickson and Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1897 and received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Glasgow in 1898. Although he was much occupied with his own teaching and experimental work, Thomson was also a dedicated amateur photographer and actor with the Dramatic Society of King's College. He taught the principles and practice of photography to the engineering students of the college and carried out experimental studies of photographic processes. Being the head of the Chemistry Department at King's College, in 1905, Thomson was offered the vacated post of vice-principal, which he held until retirement in 1914. He was an Honorary Fellow of King's and Queen's Colleges, and, in recognition of his services to chemical education, a medal was instituted in his honour to be awarded to the most distinguished chemistry students of King's College. Thomson also acted as Secretary of the Chemical Section of the Royal Society of Arts from 1879 to 1886, a Member of Council of the Society for four periods, honorary treasurer for five years, and vice-president in 1913. He served on the Council of the Chemical Society for four periods, as honorary secretary of the society from 1883 to 1893, and as senior secretary from 1893 to 1898; he also occupied the position of vice-president from 1898 to 1901, and 1923 to 1926. Thomson did not confine his activities in the Chemical Society to the purely administrative side; he served on the Library Committee of the Society and was chairman of that committee from 1905 to 1924. Thomson was elected a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry in 1878, served as a member of council for four periods, as a vice-president for three periods, as an examiner for five years, as honorary secretary for one year, as honorary registrar for six years, as a censor for twelve years, and as president for three years (1900‚Äì1903). ==References== * Category:1849 births Category:1933 deaths Category:People from Glasgow Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:British chemists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"John Millar Thomson"},{"id":"35282032","text":"A Punu-Lumbo mask A Punu-Lumbo mask is a tribal mask native to the Ogoou√© River basin in Gabon, especially in the south in Ngouni√© Province. The masks are extremely valuable to collectors of African art, and have been sold at Sotheby's for well over $400,000. The earliest known example, collected in 1867, is part of the Pitt Rivers Museum collection at the University of Oxford. Several other museums, such as the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C. are in possession of one. They have been featured in the African Negro Art show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (1935), and at the , in Rotterdam (1953). The masks were popular among European collectors during the 1920s and 1930s. ==Design== Compared stylistically to Japanese art, the masks are typically oval in shape, with narrowed eyes, arched eyebrows and small ears. The male masks (ikwar) tend to be brown and black pigment over kaolin and viewed as ugly and are shown at night whilst the masks for females (mukudj) tend to be lighter and considered prettier by the locals and are shown in the day. The Okuyi (or mokuyi) white-faced masks commonly contain nine scale-like patterns on the forehead. This is said to be a \\"central eye\\" and also a flowering tree. The white color, usually derived from kaolin, represents clarity, light, and beauty. ==Use== Male dancers are known to wear the Okuyi while dancing. The white-faced masks are also used by other Gabon and Zaire rainforest people, such as the Kotas and Mpongwe, The Ashira also share in the white-faced mask tradition, which includes soft facial characteristics. The masks have been linked to the Mukui society and to female ancestor celebration dances, a funerary spirit association.

Building work took place between 1865 and 1867 and finished with the building's dedication in 1867. The church was designed by George Gilbert Scott and has a wrought-iron chancel screen by Edwin Lutyens, who also designed the First World War memorial. There are stained glass windows by Morris & Co., including Edward Burne-Jones, and later ones by Archibald Keightley Nicholson. The church is designated as a Grade II* listed building.

The right-hand pane shows Saint Nicholas above Scapa Flow and battleships of the Grand Fleet ==Memorials== The churchyard contains several significant memorials by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who also designed the house at nearby Munstead Wood for his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll. Lutyens designed Busbridge War Memorial, a Grade II* listed building, unveiled in 1922, which sits at the end of the churchyard at the junction of Brighton Road and Hambledon Road. It is one of dozens of Lutyens' war memorials around England and elsewhere after the First World War and one of fifteen of his War Crosses, which all share a similar design. The names of the village's war dead are listed on a plaque inside the church. Lutyens also designed memorials to Julia Jekyll (Gertrude's mother), Francis McLaren, and a joint memorial to Sir Herbert Jekyll (Gertrude's brother) and his wife Dame Agnes Jekyll, and to Gertrude herself. ==Sunday Services== Busbridge Church 8:30am Quiet Service On a Sunday morning there is the Quiet Service at 8:30am.

It was founded by the merchant William Ford (or perhaps 'Fourd') in 1509 to provide accommodation for six elderly people: five men and one woman. Despite the earlier name of \\"Grey Friars\\", it bears no relationship to the Franciscan Order but was so named because of its location on Greyfriars Lane. Inside the building is a narrow courtyard (). It has been considered by historians and writers to be a particularly fine example of English domestic architecture of the period. Following Ford's death, the endowment was extended in 1517 to allow six places for couples to live together. In 1529, it was extended further to allow five more couples to stay. According to W. Hickling, a Coventry historian writing in 1846, it was by then serving forty women, each of whom received an allowance of three shillings and six pence per week. During the Coventry Blitz, the building was hit by German bombing, like many other parts of the city. A bomb dropped on 14 October 1940 killed the warden, a nurse and six residents. It was restored with original timbers between 1951 and 1953. The building is located on the site of a chapel within Greyfriars Friary. In 1940, John Bailey Shelton, a Coventry archaeologist discovered encaustic tiles typical of those found in a chapel. The building was built with a considerable amount of teak. In 2006 the building was used as a location for the episode of Doctor Who called The Shakespeare Code.\\"Dr Who's been sent to Coventry\\", Coventry Evening Telegraph 29 August 2006 In attempting to reconstruct the Globe Theatre, Shakespeare scholars have used Ford's Hospital to understand Elizabethan doorways. ==See also== *Grade I listed buildings in Coventry ==References== Category:Almshouses in England Category:Timber framed buildings in England Category:Buildings and structures in Coventry Category:Grade I listed almshouses Category:Grade I listed buildings in the West Midlands (county) ","title":"Ford's Hospital"},{"id":"35282142","text":"YPO is a publicly owned central purchasing body As defined in Public Contracts Regulations 2015, regulation 37 based in Wakefield, Yorkshire.

P. O'Shea; he was also a grandson of admiral Lucius Curtis and a descendant from admiral Lord Rodney. He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School, and completed his chemical training at Owens College. Afterwards he acted as private assistant to C. Schorlemmer, and took part in the research on the constitution of aurine. Later he worked as chemist in an explosives factory. When Firth College, Sheffield, was opened, Thomas Carnelley was appointed Professor of Chemistry and Physics. He selected O'Shea as his assistant lecturer and demonstrator in chemistry in 1881. Later O'Shea held the post of lecturer in mining chemistry, and in 1907 he was appointed Professor of Applied Chemistry in the University of Sheffield. He remained affiliated with the university to the day of his death. For several years O'Shea taught at coal mines of Derbyshire and the neighbourhood of Sheffield. He summarised the results of this experience in the book Elementary Chemistry for Coal Mining Students published in 1911, which was specially intended for students who had little or no preliminary knowledge of chemistry. O'Shea's most important contributions to pure chemistry are scientific articles on the \\"Constitution of Bleaching Powder \\"and \\" Preparation of Pure Iron\\". He also made a number of contributions on the applications of chemistry to mining problems, especially in connexion with explosions in coal mines, mining explosives, the by-products of coking, coal-washing, etc. His work in connexion with mining brought him into intimate contact with a large number of prominent mining engineers. In 1905 he was elected Secretary of the Midland Institute of Mining, Civil, and Mechanical Engineers. In 1908 the Institution of Mining Engineers, which had for many years had its headquarters at Newcastle upon Tyne, decided to move to London; simultaneously, the institution was in many respects reorganised. As its general secretary died in 1907, this position was offered to O'Shea, which he assumed on 2 September 1908 and held until his death. During the Second Boer War he went out to South Africa as a commanding officer. This experience of active service led to his being placed in command of the University contingent, which was formed in 1911, a position he retained for eight years. O'Shea was survived by a widow and one daughter. ==References== * Category:1858 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Academics of the University of Sheffield Category:British chemists ","title":"Lucius Trant O'Shea"},{"id":"35282197","text":"Gerrity's Supermarkets is a chain of grocery stores located in Pennsylvania, United States.

It is the third most widespread organized Abrahamic religion in Africa after Christianity and Islam. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) lists many large and smaller populations in Africa with Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa and Zambia among the top ten numerical populations of Bah√° º√≠s in the world in 2005, and Mauritius in terms of percentage of the national population. All three individual heads of the religion, Bah√° ºu'll√°h,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, and Shoghi Effendi, were in Africa at various times. ==Period of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's lifetime== Among its earliest contacts with the religion came in Egypt. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Egypt begins perhaps with the first Bah√° º√≠s arriving in 1863. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, founder of the religion, was himself briefly in Egypt in 1868 when on his way to imprisonment in  ªAkk√°. Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam made several journeys on behalf of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and was imprisoned in Egypt in 1868. Robert Felkin was in Egypt circa 1880s and published a number of books -later he converted to the religion.Arohanui, Introduction by Collis Featherstone. In 1892 two converts in Egypt embarked to the West intending to spread the religion and were the first Bah√° º√≠s to enter the United States where the first converts followed in 1894. The first Egyptian converts had taken place by 1896. ==Period of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s lifetime== M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl-i-Gulp√°yg√°n√≠ M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl-i-Gulp√°yg√°n√≠, often called M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, was the first prominent Bah√° º√≠ to live in Africa and made some of the first big changes to the community in Egypt. Abdu'l-Fadl first came to Cairo in 1894 where he settled for several years. He was the foremost Bah√° º√≠ scholar and helped spread the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Egypt, Turkmenistan, and the United States. In Egypt, he was successful in converting some thirty of the students of Al-Azhar University, the foremost institution of learning in the Sunni Muslim world. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl also became friends with writers and magazine publishers, and many articles that he authored appeared in the Egyptian press. In 1896, when Nasiru'd-Din Shah was assassinated in Iran, an enemy of the Bah√° º√≠s, Za ªimu'd-Dawlih, used the rumour that the assassination had been performed by Bah√° º√≠s, to cause a massacre of the Bah√° º√≠s in Egypt. When Abu'l-Fa·∏çl stood up in defense for the Bah√° º√≠s and stated that he himself was a Bah√° º√≠, his allegiance became public; then when his two books Fara'id and Al-Duraru'l-Bahiyyih were published in 1897-1900 the al-Azhar University decreed that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was an infidel. left  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, head of the religion after Bah√° ºu'll√°h, lived in Egypt for several years and several people came to meet him there: Stanwood Cobb, Wellesley Tudor Pole, Isabella Grinevskaya, and Louis George Gregory, later the first Hand of the Cause of African descent, visited  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° at Ramleh in 1911.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° then embarked on several trips to the West taking an ocean liner for the first one on August 11, 1911. He left on the next trip left March 25, 1912. One of the earliest Bah√° º√≠s of the west and a Disciple of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Lua M. Getsinger, died in 1916 and she was buried in Egypt near M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on 19 April 1916 and 15 February 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"‚Ä¶especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" ‚Ä¶the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration‚Ä¶.\\" During his tour of North America,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° gave a talk on September 2, 1912 in the Montreal home of William Sutherland Maxwell (later named a Hand of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi in 1951) and May Maxwell, the parents of Mary Maxwell, the future Amatu'l-Bah√° R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num, wife of Shoghi Effendi. He proclaimed, \\"If man himself is left in his natural state, he will become lower than the animal and continue to grow more ignorant and imperfect. The savage tribes of central Africa are evidences of this. Left in their natural condition, they have sunk to the lowest depths and degrees of barbarism, dimly groping in a world of mental and moral obscurity...If a child is left in its natural state and deprived of education, there is no doubt that it will grow up in ignorance and illiteracy, its mental faculties dulled and dimmed; in fact, it will become like an animal. This is evident among the savages of central Africa, who are scarcely higher than the beast in mental development.\\" See ideas of Feral child, Barbarian vs Noble savage, and various Uncontacted peoples. ==Period of Shoghi Effendi's lifetime== Shoghi Effendi, who was appointed the leader of the religion after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death, travelled through Africa in 1929 and again in 1940. Shoghi Effendi at the time of becoming Guardian in 1921. Taken in Haifa. The history of the religion in Kenya has an interesting precursor. Before joining the religion, Richard St. Barbe Baker served in the country in 1920 under the Colonial Office as Assistant Conservator of Forests. There he saw the wide scale deforestation going on. While there he intervened in a case of a colonial officer against a Kikuyu worker - taking a blow aimed at the worker. The struggle would eventually alienate him from the service. He developed a plan for re-forestation where food crops were planted between rows of young native trees. Because of lack of funds St. Barbe consulted with the Kenyans themselves, approaching the Kikuyu Chiefs and Elders, and together they arranged for three thousand tribal warriors to come to his camp and with the assistance of the Chiefs fifty were selected to be the first Men of the Trees. They promised before Ngai, the High God, that they would protect the native forest, plant ten native trees each year, and take care of trees everywhere. Immediately then leaving Kenya, St. Barbe offered a paper at a Congress of Living Religions in the Commonwealth about the Bantu religion following which he was introduced to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith because of \\"his genuine interest in another's religion struck a sympathetic chord with the Bah√° º√≠ principles.\\" At the other extreme of the continent the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in South Africa struggled with issues under the segregated social pattern and laws of Apartheid in South Africa. The Bah√° º√≠ community decided that instead of dividing the South African Bah√° º√≠ community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the Bah√° º√≠ administration to black adherents, and placed the entire Bah√° º√≠ community under the leadership of its black population. In 1997 the National Spiritual Assembly presented a Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa which said in part: > Abhorring all forms of prejudice and rejecting any system of segregation, > the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was introduced on a one to one basis and the community > quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity. Despite the > nature of the politics of that time, we presented our teachings on unity and > the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and > academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents.... [b]oth > individual Bah√° º√≠s and our administrative institutions were continually > watched by the security police.... Our activities did not include opposition > to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and > opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of > our Faith.... During the time when the previous Government prohibited > integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate > administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit > membership of the Bah√° º√≠ Administration to the black adherents who were and > remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire > Bah√° º√≠ community under the stewardship of its black membership.... The > pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs. > The \\"white\\" Bah√° º√≠s were often ostracized by their white neighbours for > their association with \\"non-whites\\". The Black Bah√° º√≠s were subjected to > scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and > their complete integration with their white Bah√° º√≠ brethren. To the west the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Morocco began about 1946. Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. In 1953 the Bah√° º√≠s initiated a Ten Year Crusade during which a number of Bah√° º√≠s pioneered to various parts of Africa following the requests of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. It was emphasized that western pioneers be self- effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans \\\\- and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion were to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. Among the figures of the religion in Africa the most senior African historically would be Enoch Olinga. In 1953 he became the first Bah√° º√≠ pioneer to British Cameroon, (moving from Uganda) and was given the title Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h for that country. Ali Nakhjavani, and his wife along with Olinga and two other Bah√° º√≠s travelled from Uganda to Cameroon - the other Bah√° º√≠s were dropped along the way in other countries. As the number of Bah√° º√≠s grew in Cameroon new Bah√° º√≠s left the immediate region to pioneer in other surrounding areas, each becoming a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h including Ghana, and Togo. Because of the successive waves of people becoming Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Enoch Olinga was entitled \\"Abd'l-Futuh\\", a Persian name meaning \\"the father of victories\\" by Shoghi Effendi. He was appointed as the youngest Hand of the Cause, the highest appointed position in the religion. A biography published in 1984 examined his impact in Cameroon and beyond. ==Period since the Universal House of Justice== Kampala, Uganda. Troubles characterize the experience of the Bah√° º√≠s across the Saharan countries. In 1960 with a regime change in Egypt, the Bah√° º√≠s lost all rights as an organized religious community by Law 263 at the decree of then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser which specified a minimum sentence of six months' imprisonment or a fine for any organized activities of the Bah√° º√≠s. All Bah√° º√≠ community properties, including Bah√° º√≠ centers, libraries, and cemeteries, were confiscated by the government except the cemetery Al-Rawda Al-Abadeyya. In obedience to the government is a core principal of the religion. In 1963 the arrests of Bah√° º√≠s in Morocco had gotten attention from Hassan II of Morocco, US Senator Kenneth B. Keating and Roger Nash Baldwin, then Chairman of the International League for the Rights of Man and would echo in analyses of politics of Morocco for years to come. South of the Sahara it was a different story. Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. The foundation stone of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Uganda was laid in January 1958, and it was dedicated on January 13, 1961. The building is more than 130 feet (39 m) high, and over 100 meters in diameter at the base. The green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, and the lower roof tiles are from Belgium. The walls of the temple are of precast stone quarried in Uganda. The colored glass in the wall panels was brought from Germany. The timber used for making the doors and benches was from Uganda. The property includes the House of Worship, extensive gardens, a guest house, and an administrative center.UGPulse Uganda Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum and then chairman of the central regional National Assembly Ali Nakhjavani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bah√° º√≠s through Uganda and Kenya including seeing three regional conferences on the progress of the religion, staying in homes of fellow believers, and other events. She talked to audiences about the future of African Bah√° º√≠s and their role in the religion. She visited Africa again on several trips from 1969 to 1973. In Ethiopia she was received by Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. In the half hour interview she communicated how she had long admired him because of the way he had conducted himself in the face of the many trials and hardships of his life, and by the way he had overcome them. Selassie gave her a gold medal from his Coronation. These two regions - north and central Africa - interacted closely in the 1970s. As part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was banned in the 1970s in several countries: Burundi 1974; Mali 1976; Uganda 1977; Congo 1978; Niger 1978. Uganda had had the largest Bah√° º√≠ community in Africa at the time. > \\"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab > countries. Since these countries were also by this time providers of > development aid, this overt attack on the Baha'is was supported by covert > moves such as linking the aid money to a particular country to the action > that it took against the Baha'is. This was partially successful and a number > of countries did ban the Baha'is for a time. However, the Baha'is were able > to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of Zionism nor > anti-Islamic and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these > countries except Niger.\\" (Niger lifted their restrictions in the 1990s.) The Bah√° º√≠ Faith is currently the third largest international religion in Chad and Kenya. More recently the roughly 2000 Bah√° º√≠s of Egypt have been embroiled in the Egyptian identification card controversy from 2006 through 2009. Since then there have been homes burned down and families driven out of towns. On the other hand, Sub-Saharan Bah√° º√≠s were able to mobilize for regional conferences called for by the Universal House of Justice 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Resulting conferences were held in: * Lusaka, Zambia was first (among the 750 participants, 550 were from Zambia, 80 from Zimbabwe and 120 from Malawi.) * Nakuru, Kenya, (700 Kenyans, 200 Bah√° º√≠s from Uganda, 100 from Tanzania, and 42 from Ethiopia, four came from Mozambique and three from Southern Sudan.) * Johannesburg, South Africa, (expecting a maximum of 850 people, but more than 1,000 came the first day and about 1,150 the second day.) * Bangui, Central African Republic, (planned for 200 or 300 people but realized early on that they might get double or triple that number. The revised estimates turned out to be correct ‚Äì when the Baha ºis arrived, the conference hall was overflowing with 831 people.) * Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo, (with a war close at hand 776 people from attending with 13 people were able to make it from Burundi and four from Rwanda.) * Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, (more than 1,000 attending.) * Yaound√©, Cameroon, (some 1,200 participants included 90 from Chad, 45 from Congo, 18 from Equatorial Guinea, 20 from Gabon, and 10 from S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, with a high percentage of those attending were youth, ages 12 to 22. ) * Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire, (1,200 participants including people from Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone attended.) * Accra, Ghana, (about 950 participants were from Ghana itself, joined by 156 Baha ºis from Benin, 140 from Burkina Faso, four from Cape Verde, three from Guinea Bissau, 106 from Niger, 137 from Nigeria and about 200 from Togo.) == Countries == Algeria The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Algeria dates from 1952. Though the religion achieved some growth and organization through 1967 including converts, the period of the independence of Algeria when the country adopted Islamic practices in rejection of colonial influences, subsequently, the religion was effectively banned in 1968. However, more recently the Association of Religion Data Archives and Wolfram Alpha estimated the population of Bah√° º√≠s at 3.3‚Äì3.8 thousand Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 and 2010. Angola The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Angola begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote letters encouraging taking the religion to Africa in 1916. The first Bah√° º√≠ pioneered to Angola about 1952. By 1963 there was a Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in Luanda and smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in other cities. In 1992 the Bah√° º√≠s of Angola elected their first National Spiritual Assembly. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1800 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Botswana The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Botswana begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote letters encouraging taking the religion to Africa in 1916. The first Bah√° º√≠s pioneered to Botswana about October 1954 where they befriended many Africans. By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member. The first election of Botswana's Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly was in 1970. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 16000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Burundi The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Burundi begins after 1916 with a mention by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, that Bah√° º√≠s should take the religion to the regions of Africa. The first specific mention of Burundi (Urundi) was in May 1953 suggesting the expanding community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uganda look at sending pioneers to neighboring areas like Burundi(Urundi) as part of a specific plan of action. The first settlers of the religion arrived in the region by June. By 1963 there were three Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in Burundi-Ruanda. Through succeeding organizations of the countries in the region, the National Spiritual Assembly of Burundi was first formed in 1969 but was successively dissolved and reformed a number of times - most recently reforming in 2011. Even though the religion was banned for a time, and the country torn by wars, the religion grew so that in 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated just about 6,800 Bah√° º√≠s in Burundi. Cameroon The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Cameroon was established when the country was separated into two colonies ‚Äì British and French Cameroon. The first Bah√° º√≠ in Cameroon was Enoch Olinga, who had left his homeland of Uganda to bring the religion to British Cameroon in 1953. Meherangiz Munsiff, a young Indian woman who had moved from Britain, arrived in French Cameroon April 1954 ‚Äì both Olinga and Munsiff were honoured with the title Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Currently there are 40,000 adherents of the religion in the country. Chad Though the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Chad began after its independence in 1960 members of the religion were present in associated territories since 1953. The Bah√° º√≠s of Chad elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1971. Through succeeding decades Bah√° º√≠s have been active in a number of ways and by some counts have become the third largest international religion in Chad with over 80300 members by 2000 and 96800 in 2005. Democratic Republic of the Congo The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Democratic Republic of the Congo begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote letters encouraging taking the religion to Africa in 1916. The first Bah√° º√≠ to settle in the country came in 1953 from Uganda. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was elected in 1957. By 1963 there were 143 local assemblies in Congo. Even though the religion was banned, and the country torn by wars, the religion grew so that in 2003 there were some 541 assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 252,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Egypt The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Egypt has a history over a century old. Perhaps the first Bah√° º√≠s arrive in 1863. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, founder of the religion, was himself briefly in Egypt in 1868 when on his way to imprisonment in  ªAkk√°. The first Egyptians were converts by 1896. Despite forming an early Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly and forming a National Assembly, in 1960, following a regime change, the Bah√° º√≠s lost all rights as an organised religious community by Law 263 at the decree of then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser. However, in 1963, there were still seven organized communities in Egypt. More recently, the roughly 2,000 Bah√° º√≠s of Egypt have been embroiled in the Egyptian identification card controversy from 2006 through 2009. There have been homes burned down and families driven out of towns. Ethiopia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Ethiopia begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote letters encouraging taking the religion to Africa in 1916. It is not known who the first Bah√° º√≠ was to settle in the country, but the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was elected November 1934 in Addis Ababa. In 1962 Ethiopia Bah√° º√≠s had elected a National Spiritual Assembly. By 1963 there were seven localities with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated some 27,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. The community celebrated its diamond jubilee in January 2009. Equatorial Guinea The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Equatorial Guinea begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote letters encouraging taking the religion to Africa in 1916. The first pioneer to Spanish Guinea was Elise Lynelle (then Elise Schreiber,) who arrived in Bata, Spanish Guinea (as it was called then), on 17 May 1954, and was recognized as a Knight of Baha'u'llah. In 1968 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea was elected in Santa Isabel, (later renamed Malabo). The community has elected a National Spiritual Assembly since 1984. The community celebrated its golden jubilee in 2004. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated nearly 2500 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Kenya The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Kenya began with three individuals. First, Richard St. Barbe Baker took a constructive engagement with the indigenous religion of Kenyans to a United Kingdom conference on religions, where, in sympathy with his efforts, he was presented with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and became a convert. The second individual was Enoch Olinga who traveled to Kenya when he served in the British Royal Army Educational Corps. The third came twenty-one years after the first and marked the arrival of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Kenya. In 1945 Mrs. Marguerite Preston (n√©e Wellby) arrived in Kenya. She had been a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom from 1939 through 1945 when she married a Kenyan tea grower and moved to Kenya where the couple had three children within two years and she was the only Bah√° º√≠ in the nation. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated about 429,000 Bah√° º√≠s in Kenya in 2005. Liberia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Liberia begins with the entrance of the first member of the religion in 1952 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in 1958 in Monrovia. By the end of 1963 there were five assemblies and Liberian Bah√° º√≠s elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1975. Hosting various conferences through the '70's the community was somewhat disrupted by the First Liberian Civil War with some refugees going to C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1990 and the re-establishment of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1998. Third parties invited the modern Bah√° º√≠ community into their dialogues in the country while Bah√° º√≠s have continued their work supporting a private Bah√° º√≠ school, the Bah√° º√≠ Academy and a private radio station.Review of Radio Baha'i Ecuador Author: Kurt John Hein Published by: George Ronald, 1988; Review by Des O'Shea, published in CADE: Journal of Distance Education 4,1 (1989) Almost 9,500 Bah√° º√≠s are believed to have been in Liberia in 2006. Madagascar The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Madagascar begins with the mention by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, who asked the followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to travel to Madagascar. The first Bah√° º√≠ to pioneer to Madagascar arrived in 1953 and following native converts the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1955. By 1963 in addition to the one assembly there were groups of Bah√° º√≠s living in four other locations. In late July 1967 R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum became the first Hand of the Cause to visit the country. In 1972 the Malagasy Bah√° º√≠s gathered to elect the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Madagascar. By 2003 there were 33 local assemblies and the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2005 estimated there were about 17,900 Bah√° º√≠s in the country. Malawi The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Malawi begins before the country achieved independence. Before World War I the area of modern Malawi was part of Nyasaland and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to travel to the regions of Africa. As part of a wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa the religion was introduced into this region the same year it became known as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953. A decade later there were five Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies. By 1970, now in the country of Malawi, there were 12 Local Spiritual Assemblies and a National Spiritual Assembly. Between 2000 and 2003 there were estimates of 15 to 24,500 Bah√° º√≠s in Malawi. Morocco The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Morocco began about 1946. In 1953, the Bah√° º√≠s initiated a Ten Year Crusade during which a number of Bah√° º√≠s pioneered to various parts of Morocco ‚Äì many of whom came from Egypt and a few from the United States including Helen Elsie Austin. By April 1955, the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Ceuta was elected. By January 1958, the first Bah√° º√≠ summer school was held in Rabat. By spring 1958, the Bah√° º√≠ population may have been 100 and there were six assemblies and a regional committee coordinated activities promulgating the religion. In 1960, the first all-Moroccan local assembly was elected in Zaouiat Cheikh and most of its members were Berbers. On 7 December 1961, an article in Al Alam laments the decline of Islam and attacks the Bah√° º√≠s. During the year, Bah√° º√≠ homes are entered by police and literature of the religion is confiscated. On 12 April, four Bah√° º√≠s are arrested in Nador. A regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa was organized which included Morocco in 1962. In 1963, a survey of the community counted 10 Assemblies, 12 organized groups (between 1 and 9 adults) of Bah√° º√≠s. In 1963, the arrests in Morocco had got attention from Hassan II of Morocco, US Senator Kenneth B. Keating and Roger Nash Baldwin, then Chairman of the International League for the Rights of Man and would echo in analyses of politics of Morocco for years to come. All Bah√° º√≠ meetings were prohibited in 1983 followed by arrests. This time, the response emphasized the non-partisan and obedience to government principles of the religion. 1992 estimates by the US Department of State counted some 150‚Äì200 Bah√° º√≠s. while 2001 through 2009 estimates mention the Bah√° º√≠ community at 350 to 400 persons. However Association of Religion Data Archives and Wolfram Alpha estimated 30,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 and 2010, the third largest religion in the country. Mozambique The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Mozambique begins after the mention of Africa in Bah√° º√≠ literature when  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° suggested it as a place to take the religion to in 1916. The first known Bah√° º√≠ to enter the region was in 1951‚Äì2 at Beira when a British pioneer came through on the way to what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The Mozambique Bah√° º√≠ community participated in successive stages of regional organization across southern Africa from 1956 through the election of its first Mozambique's Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly by 1963 and on to its own National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1987. Since 1984 the Bah√° º√≠s have begun to hold development projects. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated just over 2,500 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Niger The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Niger began during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of its colonial period. The first Bah√° º√≠s arrive in Niger in 1966 and the growth of the religion reached a point of electing its National Spiritual Assembly in 1975. Following a period of oppression, making the institutions of the religion illegal in the late 1970s and 80's, the National Assembly was re- elected starting in 1992. The Bah√° º√≠ community in Niger has grown mostly in the south-west of the country where they number in the low thousands. Nigeria After an isolated presence in the late 1920s, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Nigeria begins with pioneering Bah√° º√≠s coming to Sub-Saharan West Africa in the 1950s especially following the efforts of Enoch Olinga who directly and indirectly affected the growth of the religion in Nigeria. Following growth across West Africa a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1956. As the community multiplied across cities and became diverse in its engagements it elected its own National Spiritual Assembly by 1979 and had 1,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2001. Rwanda The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Rwanda begins after 1916 with a mention by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, that Bah√° º√≠s should take the religion to the regions of Africa. The first specific mention of Rwanda was in May 1953 suggesting the expanding community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uganda look at sending pioneers to neighboring areas like Ruanda. The first settlers of the religion arrived in the region by July 1953 when Bah√° º√≠s from the United States and Malawi arrived. By 1963 there were three Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in Burundi-Ruanda. Through succeeding organizations of the countries in the region, the National Spiritual Assembly of Rwanda was formed in 1972. Bah√° º√≠s, perhaps in the thousands, were among those who perished in the Rwandan genocide Following the disruption of the Rwandan Civil War the national assembly was reformed in 1997. The Bah√° º√≠s of Rwanda have continued to strive for inter-racial harmony, a teaching which Denyse Umutoni, an assistant director of Shake Hands with the Devil, mentions as among the reasons for her conversion to the religion. Recent estimates place the Bah√° º√≠ population around 15,000. Senegal The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Senegal begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, mentioned Africa as a place the religion should be more broadly visited by Bah√° º√≠s. The first to set foot in the territory of French West Africa that would become Senegal arrived in 1953. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Senegal was elected in 1966 in Dakar. In 1975 the Bah√° º√≠ community elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of Senegal. The most recent estimate, by the Association of Religion Data Archives in a 2005 report details the population of Senegalese Bah√° º√≠s at 22,000. Bah√° º√≠s claimed there are 34 local assemblies in 2003. South Africa The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in South Africa began with the holding of Bah√° º√≠ meetings in the country in 1911. A small population of Bah√° º√≠s remained until 1950 when large numbers of international Bah√° º√≠ pioneers settled in South Africa. In 1956, after members of various tribes in South Africa became Bah√° º√≠s, a regional Bah√° º√≠ Assembly which included South Africa was elected. Later each of the constituent countries successively formed their own independent Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly. Then in 1995, after a prolonged period of growth and oppression during Apartheid and the homelands reuniting with South Africa, the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of South Africa was formed. Following the end of Apartheid the South African Bah√° º√≠ community continued to grow; currently there are around of 250,000Adherents.com: Largest Baha'i Communities Bah√° º√≠s in South Africa. Tanzania The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Tanzania begins when the first pioneer, Claire Gung, arrived in 1950 in what was then called Tanganyika. With the first Tanganyikan to join the religion in 1952 the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1952 of Tanganyika in Dar es Salaam. In 1956 a regional Bah√° º√≠ Assembly which included Tanganyika was elected. Later each of the constituent countries successively formed their own independent Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly and Tanganyika, with Zanzibar, formed its own in 1964 and it and the country was renamed Tanzania. Since 1986 the Bah√° º√≠s have operated the Ruaha Secondary School as a Bah√° º√≠ school. In 2005 Bah√° º√≠s were estimated at about 163,800 adherents. Tunisia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Tunisia begins circa 1910 when the first Bah√° º√≠ arrives, possibly from Egypt. In 1956 at Ridv√°n, a marked holy day of the religion and a day on which major elections are held, three new Regional Spiritual Assemblies were established including that of North-West Africa with the chairmanship of Enoch Olinga In 1963 a survey of the community counted 1 assembly and 18 organized groups (between 1 and 9 adults) of Bah√° º√≠s in Tunisia. US State Department 2001 estimates mention the Bah√° º√≠ community at about 150 persons. However Association of Religion Data Archives and several other sources point to over 1000 Bah√° º√≠s in the country. Uganda The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uganda started to grow in 1951 and in four years time there were 500 Bah√° º√≠s in 80 localities, including 13 Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies, representing 30 tribes, and had dispatched 9 pioneers to other African locations. Following the reign of Idi Amin when the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was banned and the murder of Bah√° º√≠ Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga and his family, the community continues to grow though estimates of the population range widely from 19,000 to 105,000 and the community's involvements have included diverse efforts to promote the welfare of the Ugandan people. Zambia The Bah√° º√≠ population of Zambia has been estimated at over 162,443, or 1.70% of the population. Based on that data, Adherents.com ranks this as the sixteenth-highest national proportion of Bah√° º√≠s in the world. It also ranks Zambia's as the tenth-largest national Bah√° º√≠ community in the world in absolute terms, and the fourth-largest in Africa. The William Mmutle Masetlha Foundation, an organization founded in 1995 and run by the Zambian Bah√° º√≠ community, is particularly active in areas such as literacy and primary health care. The Maseltha Institute, its parent organization, was founded earlier in 1983. Zimbabwe In 1916‚Äì1917 a series of letters by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. In 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, was the first Bah√° º√≠ to visit the area. In 1953 several Bah√° º√≠s settled in what was then South Rhodesia as pioneers. Along with indigenous conversions in 1955 the Bah√° º√≠s formed the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare. By the end of 1963 there were 9 assemblies. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bah√° º√≠s nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970 while Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. By 2003, the 50th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠s in Zimbabwe, a year of events across the country culminated with a conference of Bah√° º√≠s from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries. There were 43 local spiritual assemblies in 2003. ==Further reading== * * ==References * Category:Heroes and Heroines of the Ten Year Crusade in Southern Africa ","title":"Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Africa"},{"id":"35282303","text":"Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation is a non-profit charity organization in Saudi Arabia set up and funded by late Crown Prince Sultan in 1995.

Its establishment followed a period of discussions and consultation following World War II and the formation of the United Nations, of which it formed part. ==History== An international sanitary conference was held in Venice in 1892, prompted in part by the spread of Asiatic cholera earlier in that century. The first international organization to cover this area was the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau in 1902, followed by the Office International d'Hygi√®ne Publique in Paris in 1909. The League of Nations Health Organization was established following the First World War inside the League of Nations framework, although it did not subsume other health organizations. These efforts were hampered by the Second World War, during which UNRRA also played a role in international health initiatives. During the United Nations Conference on International Organization, references to health had been incorporated into the United Nations Charter at the request of Brazil. It similarly passed a declaration that an international health body would be set up, co-authored by Brazil and China. The Indian politician Jawaharlal Nehru also gave his opinion in favour of starting WHO. In February 1946, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations helped draft the constitution of the new body. The draft constitution began to be signed by representative of 61 countries in June 1946, to come into force when ratified by 26 countries. Until that happened, an Interim Commission of 18 countries would prepare. The use of the word \\"world\\", rather than \\"international\\", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve. The constitution of WHO was developed from four documents, submitted by the French, British, United States and Yugoslav governments. There was a common consensus that membership should not be limited to members of the United Nations and to this effect other countries were allowed to send observers to the drafting process. The International Health Conference met between 19 June and 22 July 1946, attended by representatives of all 51 members of the UN, 13 non-member countries, 3 Allied Commission and 10 international organizations. Dr. Thomas Parran served as president of the conference. The two most discussed issues were the role of the Soviet Union (which accepted a place) and the integration of other international organizations, which was agreed and would be managed. The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries by 22 July 1946, which an article in Science described as \\"an historic day\\". It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. The transfer was authorized by a Resolution of the General Assembly. The Office International d'Hygi√®ne Publique was incorporated into the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization on 1 January 1947. The first meeting World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of US$5 million (then GBP¬£1,250,000) for the 1949 year. Dr. Andrija Stampar was the Assembly's first president, and Dr. G. Brock Chisholm was appointed Director-General of WHO, having severed as Executive Secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. It pushed quickly to establish five regional offices to complement is central staff in Geneva, Switzerland.

A proposal was introduced to the Helsinki City Council in 2011. After rejection of the initial plan in 2012, a new plan, introduced in 2013, was considered and finally rejected in 2016. Following the 2011 proposal of a plan by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation for a museum next to South Harbour, Helsinki, a debate was waged among local political and culture activists. The project's construction costs were estimated at 130‚Äì140 million euros to be paid by the city of Helsinki and the Finnish State. Guggenheim's license fee for the first 20 years was estimated as 23.4 million euros.http://proguggenheim.fi/tiesitko-taman/ Running costs of 14.4 million euros per year would outstrip annual admission fees of only 4.5 million euros. A survey found that 75% of citizens in Helsinki, and 82% of citizens in Vantaa, opposed the project. The Helsinki City Council rejected the plan in 2012. In 2013, Finland's Parliamentary Ombudsman issued a report concluding that Finnish investor and art collector Carl Gustaf Ehrnrooth, a member of the Board of Directors of the Guggenheim Foundation, and Janne Gallen-Kallela- Sir√©n, director of the Helsinki City Art Museum and a chief exponent of the Guggenhiem plan, had conflicts of interest involving the plan and each other. In September 2013, the Guggenheim Foundation advanced a revised proposal that sought to address the concerns. Operating cost estimates were revised downwards, while revenues were forecast by the Foundation to increase. In 2014, the city board agreed to reserve a new site for a potential museum at Etel√§satama and authorized the Foundation to hold an international architecture competition to design the potential museum. The competition drew a record 1,715 submissions, and six finalists were announced. In June 2015 the French-Japanese architecture firm Moreau Kusunoki Architectes was selected as the winner. In December 2016, the Helsinki city council rejected the plan. == Initial proposal == In 2009, then-Director of Helsinki City Art Museum, Janne Gallen-Kallela-Sir√©n, introduced to the city of Helsinki the idea to approach the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York regarding establishing a museum in Helsinki that might stimulate tourism. In January 2011 the Guggenheim proposed a plan to the Helsinki City Council. The proposal was for a 12,000 square meter building, with the museum comprising 4,000 square meters. Helsinki would pay the construction costs, estimated as 130‚Äì140 million euros, plus the land costs.\\"Helsinki city council reserves plot for Guggenheim\\", Yle Uutiset, 14 January 2014 The museum was planned to be supervised by a board with 4 members from Helsinki and 3 from the Guggenheim. Five to eight exhibitions annually were assumed. The museum would also provide pedagogical and educational programs highlighting Finnish art, architecture and design.HS 11.1.2012, p. A4 The Guggenheim Foundation persuaded the City Council to commission the Guggenheim Foundation itself, for a fee of 1.15 million euros, to study the feasibility of building the museum for the Foundation, a move that American professor of architecture Peggy Deamer summarized as: \\"Despite quibbles regarding which entity has more to gain in the marriage‚Äîthe Guggenheim or Helsinki‚Äîthere is no speculation about who operates under whose umbrella. This is a purely fiduciary undertaking in which the Guggenheim 'oversees' Finland‚Äôs financial performance.\\"Peggy Deamer, \\"The Guggenheim Helsinki Competition: What is the Value Proposition?\\", The Avery Review, no.9, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.

HS 3.2.2012 The report estimated the museum's running costs at 14.4 million euros annually. An estimated 530,000 annual visitor entry fees would cover 4.5 million euros of these costs. Costs for the city of Helsinki would be 6.8 million euros and for the State of Finland, 700,000 euros annually.

Paavo Arhinm√§ki, who opposed the project, commented that \\"most decision-makers thought [Sir√©n] tried to push [the Guggenheim project] very hard\\". Nevertheless, he called the findings in the report \\"problematic but minor\\", saying: \\"Finland is [such a] small country that it's very difficult to even find people who are not connected with each other.\\" Sir√©n pointed out that he had been cleared of wrongdoing by an independent investigation by the Helsinki City Council before the report was released.

In any event, Sir√©n left the Helsinki City Art Museum in late 2012 to become director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in the US. ==2013 proposal== Etel√§satama, the new site of the proposed museum, seen from the bay In September 2013, the Guggenheim Foundation advanced a revised proposal under which the museum would focus on Nordic and international architecture and design in the context of other forms of modern and contemporary art. Educational programs at the museum would provide opportunities for children and adults to expand their experience of the visual arts. The project's architect was to be chosen through an international competition.\\"Guggenheim Foundation proposes architectural competition for Helsinki museum\\", YLE, September 24, 2013\\"Guggenheim Foundation presents a new proposal for a Guggenheim Helsinki\\", Art Daily, September 2013, accessed February 12, 2014 The proposal eliminates the controversial proposed merger with Helsinki Art Museum, although this results in the loss of the 700,000 euro government subsidy, and the new museum is envisioned to gradually build up a permanent collection from parts of its exhibitions. The Guggenheim's licensing fee would be funded by private sources. Operating and administrative costs are estimated at about 10% lower than the original plan, and annual revenues are projected to be slightly higher, as annual visitors are estimated at 550,000. Journalist Lee Rosenbaum called the new estimates, again prepared with the assistance of Boston Consulting Group, \\"speculative at best\\".Rosenbaum, Lee. \\"Guggenheim‚Äôs Modified Helsinki Proposal Reduces Costs, Keeps $30-Million Licensing Fee\\", CultureGrrl, October 10, 2013 In January 2014, the city council agreed to reserve a site for the potential museum at Etel√§satama (on the other side of the bay from the earlier planned location, and nearer to the city center), and the Guggenheim Foundation was permitted to hold an international architecture competition to design the potential museum, though no decision was then made about whether to proceed with the project. One of the factors cited for considering the new plan was the Guggenheim Foundation's pledge to arrange private funds to pay the licensing fee. Another was that the Helsinki City Art Museum would remain a separate institution. Members of the council stressed that they would make an independent assessment of the costs of the project. Leif Sev√≥n questioned whether the financial support of the Swedish Cultural Foundation for the architectural competition complied with that foundation's rules, because the competition was open to architects outside the Swedish minority in Finland.

It is named sweet azalea after its sweet aroma. The flowers range in color from white to pink with red stamens. The glossy green leaves can also become deep red to purple in the fall. This plant, indigenous to the United States, is generally found growing near moist areas or streams. The plant prefers growth in acidic soil with a pH of 6.8 or less. It grows best in sandy soils above 3000 feet. Grows to a Height of 8‚Äì10 feet. The flowers are also known to contain poisonous substances and must not be consumed by wild animals or humans. The effects of consuming this plant include depression, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, and most dangerously coma. ==History== The official credit for the discovery of R. arborescens goes to Frederick Traugott Pursh and John Bartram. It was first observed in John Bartram's garden in Philadelphia as well as Blue Mountain, Pennsylvania. It has also been mentioned that the plant was initially noticed by Andr√© Michaux in 1795 in the state of North Carolina. However, after further investigation, no more species were found in his conservatory. Therefore, the recognition for the discovery of the plant was given to Frederick Traugott Pursh and John Bartram. Rhododendron arborescens was first named Azalea arborescens by Pursh in 1814. However, John Torrey renamed it Rhododendron arborescens in 1824 because he believed that it should not be taxonomically separated from the rhododendrons. Immature flowers of Rhododendron arborescens == Plant morphology == Rhododendron arborescens is a shrub up to 18 feet tall, with terminal inflorescences growing from the end of the stems. These plants also generally have yellowish-brown twigs. The leaves are oval and entire with round tips. The midribs of the leaves are known to be hairy. The leaf itself is green and waxy and approximately 1.75 to 3 inches long. It is also observed that plants that are found at higher altitudes generally have smaller leaves and smaller heights. The plant produces from 3 to 7 flowers after a white or blue shade has appeared on the leaves. These flowers contain red stigma which are quite visible all the way up to the petals. This plant is also known to be deciduous. ==Distribution== They are distributed in the eastern part of the United States. They are known to grow in parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. They are found among streams near mountains or moist forests. Rhododendron arborescens are generally known as late bloomers. They have a range of blooming from early April till September. ==Cultivation== R. arborescens grows best in soil that is slightly acidic at a pH of 5.5-6. It does not grow well in excessive water and drainage is necessary for healthy growth. It is tolerant of full sunlight but must not be overexposed. It is beneficial to plant it with the roots slightly above the ground and accumulating soil up to the plant roots. Organic matter such as sawdust and pinebark may aid the growth of the plant. Depositing a few inches of pine bark or wood chips may help in keeping moisture and preventing weeds from growing around the plant. However, mature R. arborescens do not need to be fed with fertilizer. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==Toxicity== Structure of Grayanotoxin R. arborescens contains andromedotoxins, specifically known as grayanotoxins which are water-soluble diterpenoid compounds. Both the leaf and flowers of this plant are sources of toxins. Consuming as little as 3 milliliter of nectar per kilogram body weight may be highly pernicious. Mechanism Andromedotoxins bind to the Na channels of cell membranes which increases the influx of sodium in the cell and causes extended depolarization. This causes sodium channels to accommodate calcium influx into the cell which also results in depolarization. Cardiac Action Potential Diagnosis Leaf or flower consumption of R. arborescens results in drooling and a blazing sensation in the mouth. This is supplemented with emesis, diarrhea, muscular weakness and weak vision. Other lethal cardiovascular effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and atrioventricular block. Dyspnea, and prostration may develop and someone may die in the span of one to two days. Possible Treatments One way to possibly treat it is to detoxify the body.

He returned in 1994 and 1996. ==Casting== Hill told Nigel May from Look-in that he won the role of Haydn by chance because agent made a mistake during the application process. Hill arrived at the Seven Network studios under the impression that he was auditioning for a washing powder commercial. When handed the scripts for Haydn, he was confused but carried on with the audition. Hill said that he impressed the casting department because he \\"remembered everything\\". In 1991, Hill decided to leave the series because the long filming hours had interfered with his studies. He planned to go to college and catch up on the work he had missed. ==Character development== A columnist for TV Week said that when Haydn arrives in Summer Bay, he thinks it is a \\"hick town\\". Haydn is the son of Cynthia (Belinda Giblin) and Michael Ross (Dennis Coard). He benefited from his father's boating marina business by attending a private school. In their book Home and Away Annual Kesta Desmond and David Nicholls describe Haydn as being \\"athletic and determined like his father\\"; but like his mother too because he has a \\"love of culture and a comfortable lifestyle\\". Haydn used to like family life until his parents divorced. He could not accept the ramifications of Michael's failed business ventures and finds it hard to adjust to life outside of private school. His mother is no longer around when Haydn needs her and Michael is not in the position to take him on holidays. They added that a \\"lifetime of coddling\\" makes living in Summer Bay difficult for him. However, Haydn tries to accept his new \\"enforced lifestyle\\".Kesta and Nicholls 1992, p.13. Andrea Black writing in Home and Away ‚Äì Official Collector‚Äôs Edition explained that the arrival of Haydn and Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou) \\"meant serious strife\\" in Summer Bay.Black 2009, p.13. In 1991, Haydn pretended to go missing in the bush in an attempt to reconcile his warring parents. Things didn't go to plan when he fell down a mineshaft. Black said that Michael \\"raced to the rescue of his son\\". But Haydn \\"didn't stay long in the bay\\" and he then exited the show.Black 2009, p.20. In 1994, Haydn was reintroduced into the series for a period of eight weeks. Hill told a reporter from Inside Soap that Haydn returns because he feels it is the right time to rebuild his relationship with Michael. Ally Oliver from Inside Soap reported that Michael is \\"thrilled to see him back and more than ready to forgive his son for their troubled past together.\\" He added that Haydn appears to have \\"grown up\\". But in addition to this, Haydn has also got himself \\"so deeply in debt from his gambling habits\\". Hill explained that Haydn is \\"not a bad guy\\". While he is \\"completely addicted\\" and \\"so wrapped up\\" with gambling, those around him \\"feel sorry for him more than anything else\\". Haydn needs all the help he can get but is not prepared to tell Michael the truth. Producers also created a new romance for Haydn with Finlay Roberts (Tina Thomsen). Hill and Thomsen had begun an off-screen relationship together three years prior. Producers were inspired by their romance and decided that their character should enter into a relationship. Oliver said that producers \\"were taking a gamble\\" in case the actors fell out on set. But Thomsen told the writer that she and Hill were on set, they had made an effort to keep their personal lives separate from their work. She added that when they left the studios they would \\"give each other a big hug\\" and normality would resume. On-screen Finlay cannot resist Haydn's charms and they get together. Thomsen told Oliver that Haydn is \\"tall, handsome, he's sincere and he's nice to her - what more could a girl want?\\" He later has a \\"fling\\" with Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) and producers later cast Melissa Bell to play Haydn's ex-girlfriend, Suzie Hudson, who is pregnant with his child. ==Storylines== Haydn arrives in Summer Bay shortly after his father; Michael separates from his mother, Cynthia. Haydn is enrolled at Summer Bay much to his displeasure as he has previously attended private school and on manages to upset Sophie by pointing out her literacy struggles and finds himself in argument with Blake Dean (Les Hill). Haydn confides in teacher Grant Mitchell (Craig McLachlan) about his unhappiness about being forced to move by his father. Karen (Belinda Jarrett), Blake's sister takes a liking to Haydn and makes her feeling clear but he rejects her. After a talk with Michael, Haydn begins to calm down. When roles are cast for a year ten production of Romeo and Juliet, Haydn is cast opposite Sophie, who is dating Blake. Haydn relishes the chance to goad Blake about it at every opportunity. Sophie eventually realises she has feelings for Haydn and they kiss. Karen witnesses this and is hurt. Blake sees Sophie and Haydn kissing several weeks later and punches Haydn. They later resolve matters and become friends. Cynthia arrives in Summer Bay and Haydn tries to reunite his parents but when he realises that they will not get back together and Michael is in a relationship with Pippa Fletcher (Debra Lawrence), Haydn runs away and falls into a mineshaft and is missing for several days. He is eventually found and leaves to stay with Cynthia for several weeks. Haydn later stands as Michael's best man when he marries Pippa. Haydn and Sophie later break up and Haydn leaves after a disagreement with new principal Lois Crawford (Tina Bursill). Haydn later returns to ask Michael and Pippa for a loan in order for him to set up a surf shop in the bay. This causes a rift between Michael and Pippa when Michael suggests remortgaging the caravan park in order to help Haydn. It soon becomes apparent that Haydn has a gambling problem which plays havoc with his relationship he has recently begun with Finlay. Finlay's mother Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) is opposed to the union but the couple continue. Haydn quickly slips back into his habit and begins betting again. Finlay discovers this and tries to help him through it but Haydn's resolve is weak and he flees after his horse loses and leaves notes for Michael and Finlay. Following Michael's death, Haydn returns to the Bay for the funeral and Pippa is hostile to him and when he tries to save his conscience by returning half of the money he borrowed, Pippa initially refuses but eventually swallows her pride and accepts. After learning of Marilyn's failed engagement to Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), Haydn takes an interest in Marilyn and they begin dating. This is only temporary as Haydn soon leaves to take a job on an oil rig but returns several months later to win Marilyn back when she resumes her relationship with Donald but she turns him down after she learns he has got another woman, Suzie Hudson, pregnant and he leaves again. ==Reception== A columnist for Inside Soap said that Haydn was the \\"prodigal\\" and \\"errant\\" son of Michael. They observed him as once being a \\"snooty\\" private schooled child who later grew up to be street wise. They added that viewers would not catch anyone hassling Haydn for being snooty in his latter appearances. While another said that Haydn was a \\"good boy gone bad\\". ==References== ;Bibliography * * ==External links== * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Haydn Ross"},{"id":"35282588","text":"An American Romance is a 1944 American epic drama film directed and produced by King Vidor, who also wrote the screen story. Shot in Technicolor, the film stars Brian Donlevy and Ann Richards and is narrated by Horace McNally. The film is also known as The American Miracle. ==Premise== European immigrant Stefan Dubechek (Brian Donlevy) arrives in America in the 1890s and becomes involved in the steel industry. He eventually becomes an automobile manufacturer, and later, in World War II, a plane manufacturer. ==Cast== * Brian Donlevy as Stefan Dubechek/Steve Dangos * Ann Richards as Anna O'Rourke Dangos * Walter Abel as Howard Clinton * John Qualen as Anton Dubechek * Horace McNally as Teddy Roosevelt Dangos/Narrator * Mary McLeod as Tina Dangos * Bob Lowell as George Dangos * Fred Brady as Abraham Lincoln Dangos * Billy Lechner as Joe Chandler, Jr. * Jerry Shane as Bob Chandler * Harold Landon as Joe * J. M. Kerrigan as Charlie O'Rourke ==Production== The film was part of a trilogy directed and produced by King Vidor consisting of war, wheat and steel. His films on war and wheat were The Big Parade (1925) and Our Daily Bread (1934). This was to be his steel industry epic film. Vidor came up with the story which he proposed to Eddie Mannix. Vidor then sent a telegram to author Louis Adamic, who wrote on the topic of immigration and labor. The screenplay was ultimately credited to Herbert Dalmas and William Ludwig, representing a long list of contributing writers, including John Fante, and alternate titles. The film's working titles were America, This Is America, An American Story, American Miracle and The Magic Land. Vidor initially wanted to cast Spencer Tracy as Steve Dangos, Ingrid Bergman as Anna and Joseph Cotten as the lead character's friend Howard Clinton. All three were unavailable, so cast in their place were Brian Donlevy as Dangos and Walter Abel as Howard Clinton. Vidor later said that he felt that Donlevy was miscast as Steve Dangos because he was known for playing \\"blunt and blustering\\" characters.Durgnat 1988 p.223 Frances Gifford and Ann Sothern were reportedly considered for the role of Anna but Australian actress Ann Richards was chosen after principal photography began in April 1943. Vidor used several different locations for exterior and industrial shots. He shot footage of factories and mines in Hibbing, Minnesota, the dock in Duluth, Minnesota and the Ford River A&O; Rouge Plant in Dearborn, Michigan. Atmosphere and background shots were filmed in Lake Superior. Additional industrial shots of the Carnegie Illinois Steel Works factory in Chicago and the Indiana Steel Plant in Gary, Indiana were also filmed. For a racing scene, Vidor used footage filmed at the Indianapolis 500 in Speedway, Indiana. Other scenes were filmed at the Chrysler automobile factory in Detroit, the Consolidated Plant in San Diego and the Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California. Vidor also recalled filming in Wilmington, California. Background footage of a blast furnace used in the film was shot in Irontown, Utah. An American Romance took fifteen months to complete and its final budget totaled at $3,000,000. ==Reception== The film was shown at a preview screening in Inglewood, California. The original cut was 151 minutes which Louis B. Mayer praised but still chose to remove thirty minutes after complaints from theater managers that the film was too long. It is unknown if the edited footage still survives. Vidor was not happy with the cuts as he felt they hurt the story. An American Romance made its world premiere in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 11, 1944, opened in New York City on November 12, 1944, and in Los Angeles on December 13, 1944. The film received mixed reviews and was a financial failure. King Vidor refused to work for MGM again. He later wrote about the film in his 1953 autobiography A Tree Is a Tree: > I was determined to tell the story of steel from the viewpoint of an eager > immigrant in 'An American Romance' ... When the picture was previewed in > Inglewood, Louis B. Mayer came to me on the sidewalk in front of the > theater, put his arm around my shoulders and said, 'I've just seen the > greatest picture our company ever made'. However, an order came from the New > York office to cut half an hour. They cut the human elements of the story > instead of the documentary sections, explaining that this was the only way a > half hour could be taken out without complications in the musical > soundtrack. In other words, the film was edited according to the soundtrack > and not according to the inherent story values. At the lowest emotional > level I have reached since I have been on Hollywood, I went to my office, > packed up and moved out of the studio. The picture was not a box office > success. Many of the inhabitants of Hollywood and Beverly Hills have never > seen the film and many do not even know it was made. I spent 3 years of my > life on the project and MGM spent close to $3,000,000. MGM recorded a loss of $1.7 million on the film. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. ==See also== *List of American films of 1944 ==References* * Category:1940s historical drama films Category:1944 films Category:American historical drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American epic films Category:Films directed by King Vidor Category:Films set in the 1890s Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Indiana Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:Films shot in San Diego Category:Films shot in Utah Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by William Ludwig Category:Films scored by Nathaniel Shilkret Category:American black-and-white films Category:1944 drama films ","title":"An American Romance"},{"id":"35282633","text":"or angama odori (angama dance) is a style of dancing that is performed in many communities of Japan's Yaeyama Islands during the Bon Festival, which is known as s≈çrin (< sh≈çry≈ç (Á≤æÈúä)) in Yaeyama. A related performance is known as mushƒÅma in Hateruma. In Kohama Island, the northern community performs a dance named jiruku while the southern community performs Minma buduri. ==Etymology== There is no consensus on the etymology of angama. One theory decomposes angama into *an (possibly meaning mother) and *gama (possibly a diminutive suffix). Another theory relates angama to \\"elder sister\\" (angwƒÅ in Okinawan). Some argue that it might mean \\"disguise of a mask\\". ==Nenbutsu practice== Angama shares its mainland Japanese origin with Okinawa's EisƒÅ. The songs to which people dance are called nenbutsu songs. According to the genealogy of the San'y≈ç lineage, nenbutsu practice was brought from Ry≈´ky≈´ in 1657 when Yaeyama's samurai leader Miyara Ch≈çj≈´ traveled to Okinawa to pay tribute. It is known from other sources that by that time nenbutsu practice had spread to the capital Shuri‚ÄìNaha region of Okinawa Island. There were at least two traditions of nenbutsu practice. One was started in the 1600s by Taich≈´ (1552‚Äì1639), a J≈çdo sect monk from Mutsu Province, and was carried on by his followers in Kakinohana, Naha. The other was performed by the ChondarƒÅ, a Shuri-based group of puppeteers, who also had mainland Japanese roots. Folklorist Shinj≈ç Toshio argued that what Miyara Ch≈çj≈´ learned must have been Taich≈´'s one. Sakai Masako, a researcher on folk music, questioned Shinj≈ç's theory. Pointing out that Yaeyama has a larger repository of nenbutsu songs than Okinawa, she presumed multiple origins of nenbutsu songs. It was considered taboo to sing nenbutsu songs out of season. ==Performances== According to the local historian Kishaba Eijun, angama traditions can be divided into two groups: one is performed by the four samurai communities of Ishigaki Island and the other is of commoners in rural communities and remote islands. He argued that the latter had better preserved its traditional way. In the samurai communities of Ishigaki, a group of people with drums (taiko) and sanshin parades around houses of each village. They enter a house that is surrounded by a larger number of spectators. Once everyone sits, Uya nu Ugun (Ë¶™„ÅÆÂæ°ÊÅ©, or Nz≈ç Nenbutsu ÁÑ°ËîµÂøµ‰ªè) was sung to mark the beginning, and dancers clap with the beat. Dances and songs alternate with question and answer, in which two masked character Ushumai (old man) and Nmi (old woman) represent ancestral spirits and answer in a humorous way to questions about the afterlife asked by villagers. Kishaba noted that what distinguished samurai's angama from the rural one was that the former was an indoor performance. In rural communities, angama dances are performed in the garden. A group of people forms a circle. In the center people sing and play drums, flutes, gongs and sanshin, depending on regional variants, and they are surrounded by male and female dancers. \\"Shichigwachi Nenbutsu\\" (‰∏ÉÊúàÂøµ‰ªè), \\"K≈çK≈ç Nenbutsu\\" (Â≠ùË°åÂøµ‰ªè) and \\"Chonjon Nenbutsu\\" (‰ª≤È†ÜÂøµ‰ªè) were mainly sung. ==References== Category:Buddhism in Japan Category:Dances of Japan Category:Ritual dances Category:Yaeyama culture ","title":"Angama (dance)"},{"id":"35282650","text":"Geert Van Calster (born 1970) is a Belgian lawyer and legal scholar, focusing on conflict of laws (private international law), international trade law, EU and international environmental law, and EU economic law.

It was followed by the loose sequels Return of the Bad Men (1948) and Best of the Badmen (1951). In the opening sequence of the film, a voiceover briefly sketches the making and the history of Bad Man's territory. The narrative would seem to be from a straight forward authoritative source. Unfortunately, the voice belongs to Ray Collins, fourth billed in the film, and possibly the shadiest character in Quinto. Collins later played Lieutenant Tregg on the Perry Mason TV show of the fifties and sixties. But he's too shady as a character in the film to be delivering this 'authoritative' opening overview. ==Plot== Just north of Texas and west of the Oklahoma border is \\"Badman's Territory\\", a region not yet governed by statehood. This is where Jesse James and brother Frank head after a train robbery, along with their partner, Coyote. Mark Rowley, a lawman, and his deputy brother Johnny are after the James gang. So is a ruthless U.S. marshal named Hampton who shoots anybody who gets in his way. He even wings Johnny Rowley just to take the newly captured Coyote away from him. In the town of Quinto, newspaper editor Henryetta Alcott is a crusader for law and order. Mark takes an immediate liking to her. He also helps Belle Starr's horse win a big race. Johnny's injuries mend, but the Dalton gang persuades Johnny to go bad and join them. Mark tries to dissuade him. He shoots a man named McGee who stole his horse. Hampton puts up wanted posters on both Rowleys. Henryetta spreads the word that Oklahoma has annexed this territory into the union. Mark is appointed a \\"regulator\\" and proposes marriage to Henryetta before he rides to Coffeyville, Kansas, where the Daltons are about to pull a job with Johnny as part of the gang. Johnny is shot and killed, and Hampton also kills Coyote. A determined Mark Rowley must deal with Hampton once and for all if Henryetta and he are to have a future together. ==Cast== *Randolph Scott as Mark Rowley *George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes as Coyote *Ann Richards as Henryetta Alcott *Ray Collins as Colonel Farewell *James Warren as John Rowley *Morgan Conway as Marshall Bill Hampton *Virginia Sale as Meg *John Halloran as Hank McGee *Andrew Tombes as Doc Grant *Richard Hale as Ben Wade *Harry Holman as Hodge *Chief Thundercloud as Chief Tahlequah *Lawrence Tierney as Jesse James *Tom Tyler as Frank James *Steve Brodie as Bob Dalton *Phil Warren as Great Dalton *William Moss as Bill Dalton *Nestor Paiva as Sam Bass *Isabel Jewell as Belle Starr *Chet Brandenburg as Townsman (uncredited) *Budd Buster as Doc's Friend (uncredited) *George Chesebro as Johnny (uncredited) *Neal Hart as Townsman (uncredited) *Harry Harvey, Sr. as Stationmaster (uncredited) *Robert Homans as Judge (uncredited) *Ben Johnson as Deputy Marshall (uncredited) *Ethan Laidlaw as Lt.

Nordmark had witnessed the event while visiting the canyon. Olle Emanuel Nordmark (May 25, 1890 - December 18, 1973) was a Swedish painter and muralist born in Nordanholen at Mockfj√§rd parish. He started to draw and paint at an early age. In the beginning he was taught by his father, but in 1901 he came in contact with Gustaf Ankarcrona in Leksand who taught him the basics. At the age of 15, he had decided that he is going to become an artist. He continued his studies at Althin's School of Painting in Stockholm where he trained in fresco painting. After his studies Nordmark worked with mural- and decorative paintings for private homes and churches in Sweden. While working his interest towards theatrical scenery started to grow. In 1917 he traveled to Moscow to study theatrical scenery. The next year he returned to Stockholm, where he started to work with theatrical sceneries and drawings for costumes. He worked for among others theatres like the S√∂dra Teatern, the Stora Teatern, the Folkan, the Oscars Teatern and the Royal Swedish Opera. Nordmark stayed in Stockholm until 1924. Meanwhile, he became a very well known and appreciated designer of theatrical sceneries. His works were very imaginative, beautiful and colorful. Nordmark worked also with Karl Gerhard on sets for 22 productions. During his time in Stockholm he worked also as the head of Grabowska a decorative painting workshop at Karlav√§gen and arranged a number of displays in the news-office window of Svenska Dagbladet for among others Barn√§ngen and Finbruken. He decorate also several churches like Engelbrektskyrkan, Saltsj√∂badskyrkan, churches in Bor√•s and Karlskrona and the wedding hall in Stockholm Court House. In 1924 Nordmark participated for free in the restoration of the church in Mockfj√§rd, because of his love for his homestead. The same year he started to paint a portrait of G√§dd. Lars Holmberg, which he finished in America and then donated to the church in Mockfj√§rd. To acquire more knowledge within his field, he made several study trips on the European continent to for example France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. In 1924 he emigrated to America in search for a broader working field than what Sweden could offer him. He lived there until 1964 when he moved to France. In America leading Broadway theater directors noticed him immediately and he worked in some sets for productions. Mostly he worked though with mural paintings for private commission in New York. Known decorations made by him are among others the American Swedish Historical Museum and the John Ericsson Room in the John Morton Memorial Building in Philadelphia,\\"Day 265 - American Swedish Historical Museum\\" Nordic Way (retrieved 2012-03-31) narthex ceiling of the First Swedish Baptist Church of New York\\"Day 231 - The Swedish Church\\" Nordic Way (retrieved 2012-03-31) and the Swedish Room at the University of Pittsburgh. Nordmark also participated in several exhibitions, including one at the Brooklyn Museum in the year 1932Press release Brooklyn Museum, 1932-04-03 and another at the Delphic Studios in New York. He wrote also the books Modern Methods and Techniques for Painting in Fresco and Secco (1947) and Course in Beginning Oil Painting (1960). Nordmark died at the end of 1973 in France. == Teaching == Although it is not known when Nordmark started to teach, it is possible that he had a summer art school at his studio in Lomala, Hopewell Junction, New York, already in the early 1930s. Among his first known students were Reginald Marsh and Elsa Jemne. In 1934 Marsh traveled to Lomala to learn the art of fresco painting from Nordmark, in anticipation of his commission to execute murals. He stayed for about six months with Nordmark studying fresco techniques. Marsh returned to Lomala in July 1935 with George Biddle to get extra training right before their mural projects in the Post Office Department Building in Washington, D.C. Jemne studied also fresco techniques with Nordmark at Lomala in preparation for future work in 1935. Biddle and Marsh employed Nordmark to superintend their mural projects in the Post Office Department Building. Nordmark was involved with the project from around August 1935 to early 1936. In order that Nordmark would truly be able to superintend the project, Biddle hoped to induce Edward Bruce to give Nordmark some sort of work in Washington, D.C. It is possible that Nordmark was employed by the Resettlement Administration around October 1935. He served later as a technical consultant for the Section of Fine Art and supervised mural paintings made by Native American artists. Biddle spent a summer studying fresco techniques with Nordmark, before he began his work in the Department of Justice Building in 1936. Like a year before, Nordmark was hired to supervise the mural projects of Biddle and Henry Varnum Poor. In 1937 Nordmark joined Marsh in New York City for the Custom House murals. Marsh had insisted on using fresco for the murals, despite of objections from higher- ups. Nordmark worked also as a federal artist-in-residence in Pine Ridge Reservation in 1937, where Andrew Standing Soldier was studying under him. The Department of the Interiors's Bureau of Indian Affairs employed Nordmark to teach fresco painting to Native Americans from 1938 to 1943. He was working at the Indian Art Center, a program for outstanding students and teachers, in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, from 1938 to 1940. In 1940 instructors and students from Phoenix Indian School, Phoenix, Arizona, traveled to Fort Sill to study under Nordmark. There is little known about the Indian Art Center. Some records of the program probably exist, but many may have been destroyed. According to Leonard Riddles the students were taught tempera painting, oil painting, fresco and secco. Oscar Jacobson, director of University of Oklahoma art department and founder of the university's art museum, criticized Nordmark's teaching. Commissioner John Collier was forced to defend it. He replied that Nordmark taught only techniques and never dictated style, design or colors to his students. This was proved by the uniquely individualistic work of Standing Soldier, who was studying again with Nordmark at the Indian Art Center in circa 1938, and of the Native Americans, who painted murals in the Department of the Interior Building. Among Nordmark's other known students at the Indian Art Center were * Spencer Asah, James Auchiah, Stephen Mopope and Leonard Riddles in 1938, * Archie Blackowl, Franklin Gritts, Cecil Murdock and Andrew Tsihnahjinnie in 1939, * Allan Houser, Oscar Howe and Victor Pepion in 1940. Blackbear Bosin, Woody Crumbo, Charles Loloma, Fred Kabotie and David E. Williams. studied also with Nordmark at the Indian Art Center, but more detailed information about their years of attendance have not been found. Gerald Nailor, Sr. studied with Nordmark in 1940, but the location is uncertain. According to literature he studied either privately in Oklahoma or Fort Sill Indian School, Lawton, Oklahoma. Some sources tells that Nailor enrolled with his close friend Houser for one year at the Fort Sill Indian School. Nordmark was probably teaching at the Phoenix Indian School from 1941 to 1943. Among his students were Richard West from 1941 to 1942 and Patrick DesJarlait likely in 1942. George Smith \\"Woogee\\" Watchetaker and Herman Toppah studied also with Nordmark, but the references do not give any further information about neither the location nor the year. Later Jacobson and Nordmark mentored together some Philbrook artists including Crumbo, Albin Jake and Jesse Edwin Davis II. Nordmark worked as advisor or supervisor for many mural painting projects. Some of the projects he supervised were made by * Auchiah, Blackowl, Crumbo, Gritts, Mopope, Riddles at Fort Sill Indian School from 1939 to 1940, * Auchiah, Crumbo, Herrera, Houser, Mopope, Nailor at Department of the Interior Building, Washington, D.C., from 1939 to 1940, * Pepion at Museum of the Plains Indian, Browning, Montana in the summer of 1941. == Later life == Nordmark never forgot his native locality. He donated 58 drawings and sketches to the local history society, Mockfj√§rd Hembygdsf√∂rening, in 1958. These works are frequently exhibited. In 1964 Nordmark moved to Huningue, France, where he lived for the rest of his life. He is buried at a cemetery in Huningue. == Personal life == In 1916 Nordmark got engaged to Ruth Granath, the daughter of a wealthy furnisher from V√§ster√•s. Granath broke off the engagement, after she fell in love with a Dane on a vacation to Hornb√¶k in Denmark. Nordmark had not been able to join her on the vacation, as he could not take off from work. He got later married with a Finnish artist, Hilja Elonen (November 16, 1888‚ÄîApril 22, 1963). After her death Nordmark got married with a Swede called Marie-Louise. == Artistic style == Nordmark is known for his exquisitely beautiful colors, his original ideas and artistic taste. The lines and the colors in his theater decorations and costumes helped to create the most striking effects. == Notes  References == \\"Swedish-American artists' index\\" . ==External links== * * Photograph of Olle Nordmark * Photograph of Olle Nordmark Category:1890 births Category:1973 deaths Category:20th-century Swedish painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Swedish male painters Category:Muralists ","title":"Olle Nordmark"},{"id":"35282807","text":"Scott Arthur Tucker (September 17, 1957 ‚Äì present) is an American conductor.

He started playing the trumpet at the age of nine, His maternal grandfather was an amateur musician and his sister became a professional musician. He received a B.S. degree in psychology from Tufts University and a Bachelor of Music degree in trumpet performance from the New England Conservatory of Music through a five-year, double degree program. He then spent some years as a freelance musician in the Boston area.Professor Scott Tucker Leads Choral Music at Cornell University, Celebrity Dialogue, March 29th, 2010 (visited March 31, 2012) He subsequently earned a Master of Music degree in choral conducting from the New England Conservatory. Following his graduate degree, Tucker served as assistant choral director at Harvard University for six years under Jameson Marvin, and as choral director at Milton Academy where his duties also included coaching basketball. He also served as a tenor soloist at King's Chapel in Boston under the direction of Daniel Pinkham.Cornell University Chorus, Our Director (visited March 31, 2012). Cornell University, 1995-2012 In 1995, he was appointed as assistant professor at Cornell's music department, and as the director of choral music including responsibility for directing the Cornell University Glee Club and the Cornell University Chorus. A review of a Glee Club performance in 2000 by The Washington Post, while not uncritical, found that Tucker had \\"forged an ensemble of a cappella singers fully in touch with one another.\\"Cecilia Porter, Cornell Meets Camerata, The Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2000, p. C07 Things improved steadily, and by 2011 a review in the San Francisco Classical Voice described Tucker as \\"a conductor who knows his medium well,\\" praising \\"the ease and smoothness of the delivery, the unity in the expressive shaping of phrases, [and] the musical flow,\\" all of which reflected \\"Tucker's sound musicianship and obvious rapport with his singers.\\"Robert P. Commanday, Alive, Awake, and SInging, San Francisco Classical Voice, January 8, 2011 (visited March 31, 2012) The Cornell choral program also experienced organizational growth during Tucker's tenure. In 2006, Tucker's position was endowed as the Priscilla Edwards Browning Director of Choral Music. While at Cornell, he oversaw new commissioning projects for both the Chorus and Glee Club, including a project for the Chorus informally titled \\"No Whining, No Flowers\\" that focused on commissioning women composers to set texts by women poets. Choral Arts Society of Washington, 2012-Present On March 28, 2012, Tucker was appointed as director of the Choral Arts Society of Washington, succeeding Norman Scribner for the 2012-13 season. Tucker was viewed as a surprise candidate and a relatively unknown figure in Washington. His musicality, rapport with the chorus during the audition process, and his fundraising and commissioning experience were all viewed as factors positively contributing to his selection.Anne Midgette, Choral Arts Society names director, Washington Post, March 29, 2012, p.

It forms the central peak within Gale crater and is located around , rising high from the valley floor. Its ID in the United States Geological Survey's Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature is 15000.Aeolis Mons On August 6, 2012, Curiosity (the Mars Science Laboratory rover) landed in \\"Yellowknife\\" Quad 51 of Aeolis Palus, next to the mountain. NASA named the landing site Bradbury Landing on August 22, 2012. Aeolis Mons is a primary goal for scientific study. On June 5, 2013, NASA announced that Curiosity would begin an journey from the Glenelg area to the base of Aeolis Mons. On November 13, 2013, NASA announced that an entryway the rover would traverse on its way to Aeolis Mons was to be named \\"Murray Buttes\\", in honor of planetary scientist Bruce C. Murray (1931‚Äì2013). The trip was expected to take about a year and would include stops along the way to study the local terrain. On September 11, 2014, NASA announced that Curiosity had reached Aeolis Mons, the rover mission's long-term prime destination. On October 5, 2015, possible recurrent slope lineae, wet brine flows, were reported on Mount Sharp near Curiosity. On June 1, 2017, NASA reported that an ancient striated lake had existed in Gale crater that could have been favorable for microbial life. As of , , Curiosity has been on the planet Mars for sols ( days) since landing on August 6, 2012. (See Current status.) ==Formation== The mountain appears to be an enormous mound of eroded sedimentary layers sitting on the central peak of Gale. It rises above the northern crater floor and above the southern crater floor, higher than the southern crater rim. The sediments may have been laid down over an interval of 2 billion years, and may have once completely filled the crater. Some of the lower sediment layers may have originally been deposited on a lake bed, while observations of possibly cross-bedded strata in the upper mound suggest aeolian processes. However, this issue is debated, and the origin of the lower layers remains unclear. If katabatic wind deposition played the predominant role in the emplacement of the sediments, as suggested by reported 3 degree radial slopes of the mound's layers, erosion would have come into play largely to place an upper limit on the mound's growth. On December 8, 2014, a panel of NASA scientists discussed (archive 62:03) the latest observations of Curiosity about how water may have helped shape the landscape of Mars, including Aeolis Mons, and had a climate long ago that could have produced long-lasting lakes at many Martian locations. On October 8, 2015, NASA confirmed that lakes and streams existed in Gale crater 3.3 - 3.8 billion years ago delivering sediments to build up the lower layers of Mount Sharp. On February 1, 2019, NASA scientists reported that Curiosity had determined, for the first time, the density of Mount Sharp in Gale crater, thereby establishing a clearer understanding of how the mountain was formed. ==Understanding size== Mons Hadley, on the Moon, is high. { class=\\"sortable \\" align=\\"right\\" style=font-size:11px !

When Gale crater became a candidate landing site, the mountain was given various labels e.g. in 2010 a NASA photo caption called it \\"Gale crater mound\\".NASA ‚Äì Layers in Lower Formation of Gale Crater Mound In March 2012, NASA unofficially named it \\"Mount Sharp\\", after American geologist Robert P. Sharp. Comparison of Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mons) to the sizes of three large mountains on Earth. Since 1919 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has been the official body responsible for planetary nomenclature. Under its long-established rules for naming features on Mars, mountains are named after the Classical albedo feature in which they are located, not after people. In May 2012 the IAU officially named the mountain Aeolis Mons after the Aeolis albedo feature. It also gave the name Aeolis Palus to the plain located on the crater floor between the northern wall of Gale and the northern foothills of the mountain. The IAU's choice of name is supported by the United States Geological Survey. Martian craters are named after deceased scientists, so in recognition of NASA and Sharp, at the same time the IAU named \\"Robert Sharp\\", a large ( diameter), crater located about west of Gale. NASA and the European Space AgencyESA ‚Äì Mars Express marks the spot for Curiosity landing continue to refer to the mountain as \\"Mount Sharp\\" in press conferences and press releases. This is similar to their use of other informal names, such as the Columbia Hills near one of the Mars Exploration Rover landing sites. In August 2012, the magazine Sky & Telescope ran an article explaining the rationale of the two names and held an informal poll to determine which one was preferred by their readers. Over 2700 people voted, with Aeolis Mons winning by 57% to Mount Sharp's 43%. ==Spacecraft exploration== On December 16, 2014, NASA reported detecting, based on measurements by the Curiosity rover, an unusual increase, then decrease, in the amounts of methane in the atmosphere of the planet Mars; as well as, detecting Martian organic chemicals in powder drilled from a rock by the rover. Also, based on deuterium to hydrogen ratio studies, much of the water at Gale Crater on Mars was found to have been lost during ancient times, before the lakebed in the crater was formed; afterwards, large amounts of water continued to be lost. On June 1, 2017, NASA reported that the Curiosity rover provided evidence of an ancient lake in Gale crater on Mars that could have been favorable for microbial life; the ancient lake was stratified, with shallows rich in oxidants and depths poor in oxidants; and, the ancient lake provided many different types of microbe-friendly environments at the same time. NASA further reported that the Curiosity rover will continue to explore higher and younger layers of Mount Sharp in order to determine how the lake environment in ancient times on Mars became the drier environment in more modern times. On August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity landing, and related exploratory accomplishments, on the planet Mars. (Videos: Curiosity First Five Years (02:07); Curiosity POV: Five Years Driving (05:49); Curiosity Discoveries About Gale Crater (02:54)) On April 11, 2019, NASA announced that Curiosity had drilled into, and closely studied, a \\"clay-bearing unit\\" which, according to the rover Project Manager, is a \\"major milestone\\" in Curiosity journey up Mount Sharp.

The cause of the haze is uncertain, which has led to speculation that suspended ash particulates from volcanic eruptions, suspended smoke particulates from large-scale forest fires, open agricultural burning in neighbouring countries, as well as local agricultural burning had caused the haze. The disruption happened again in August 1990, from June to October 1991, and has recurred every year since 1992, plaguing the months of August, September, and October. The effects of the haze reached their zenith in 1997 when the cause of the haze was confirmed to be forest and plantation fires in Southern Sumatra, Kalimantan, and some other islands of Indonesia as the sky remained dull with pollution from August until November of that year. ==Impact== Haze over Kuala Lumpur. Haze obscuring the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. By September 1997, forest fires in Indonesia had been raging uncontrollably. The area where the fire took place was estimated to be the size of 4 million football pitches and was visible even from space. The Indonesian forest fires produced noxious yellow smoke clouds that smothered a vast region of South East Asia, reaching as far as northern Australia. The clouds caused the air quality disaster known as the 1997 South East Asian haze. Millions of people were forced to wear masks and hundreds of death were reported in Indonesia, as a direct or indirect result of a severe decline in air quality. The impact of the haze caused the Air Pollution Index, which is used by Malaysia, to rises to alarmingly hazardous levels. In the Malaysian state of Sarawak, these API numbers hit record levels. In just six days, 10,000 people had sought treatment for haze related issues. In Malaysia, the Prime Minister was forced to declare a State of Emergency, closing schools, government offices and many shops all over the state, including constructions and industries, which ground to a halt. The total cost of the damage caused by the haze to Malaysia was estimated to be RM802 million or US$321 million, for the period between August to October 1997. The damage caused by the haze affected the GDP by an estimated 0.30 per cent. The haze even affected the output of gas turbines at the Kuala Langat Power Plant (KLPP), Malaysia. It was hypothesized that gas turbine combustions during haze-free periods when oxygen levels were sufficient, could to achieve perfect or near perfect combustion. However, during the period when the haze occurred, the air contained less amount of oxygen, which affected the combustion, causing it to not perform optimally. ==Actions== The then Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, searched desperately for a solution. The head of the Malaysian fire and rescue department came up with a plan to send a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia. Operation Haze became the biggest cross-border firefighting mission in history. Malaysian firefighters fought a desperate battle with the fires raging across Sumatra and Kalimantan over 25 days, and faced insurmountable obstacles. At the peak of massive forest and land fires, the numbers of hotspots reached 37,938, which occurred in August 1997. Healthy-looking trees could fall upon them as it base burned out. Peat fires posed the worst risk as the firefighters could be dropped in fire pits as the fires burn deep underground. There they encountered huge problems ranging from the lack of right equipment, no water source to fight the fires with, up to the problem of identifying the source of the fires deep in the peat land. Finally, after 25 days, they managed to battle the haze so that visibility to the sky was restored. Also, with the help of monsoon rains, the haze threat was finally over. ==Post operations== At the end of it all, a total of between 8 and 10 million hectares of forest was destroyed, an estimated 40,000 people sought hospital treatment and many deaths were reported, tourism was severely impacted, and an estimate of US$10 billion in losses were recorded across the region. ==Future mitigating plans== As part of steps taken to avoid the recurring of the Haze, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) approved the need for an early warning system in the Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) in 1998 to prevent forest fires and the resulting haze through improved management policies and enforcements, example via Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS)http://www.wamis.org/agm/meetings/wofire08/S2-Zaki_Malaysia.pdf In addition, Malaysia and Indonesian come up with a Disaster Cooperation and Assistance which was signed by H.E. Datuk Seri Mohamed bin Rahmat, who is the National Disaster Management and Relief Committee Chairman as well as the Minister of Information, on behalf of the Malaysian Government and H.E. Dato‚Äô Seri Utama ft.

He was co-author of a seminal series of books on chemical technology that helped begin university teaching of chemical applications for industry, and was a pioneer in the incorporation of advanced research into a manufacturing firm. ==Upbringing and family== The grave of Edmund Ronalds, Rosebank Cemetery He was born on 18 June 1819 at 48 Canonbury Square in Islington. His father Edmund Sr was a London cheesemonger and the brother of inventor Sir Francis Ronalds and his mother Eliza Jemima was the daughter of Dr James Anderson, who ran a respected school in Hammersmith. For most of his childhood the family lived at Brixton Hill but they returned to Islington in 1839 and resided at the east end of Canonbury Place. He was the eldest of at least 12 children. Five of his siblings moved to New Zealand in the 1850s where his sisters married brothers of Harry Atkinson. Another sister spent her last years in Algiers. Two siblings married into Samuel Greg's cotton-spinning family. == Education and career == Ronalds' university education was conducted principally in Germany. His key supervisors for his subsequent career were philosophy professor Jakob Friedrich Fries of the University of Jena, Gustav Magnus, the professor of physics and technology at the University of Berlin, and chemistry professor Justus von Liebig at the University of Giessen, where he was awarded his doctorate in 1842. On returning home in 1842, he became assistant to Professor Thomas Graham at University College London. He then held lectureships in chemistry simultaneously at the Aldersgate Medical School and the Middlesex Hospital School of Medicine. In 1849 he was appointed as the inaugural professor of chemistry at Queen's College Galway (now NUI Galway). Ronalds resigned his chair at Galway in 1856 to run the Bonnington Chemical Works, where the residues from the manufacture of coal gas at the Edinburgh gasworks were processed into valuable products. His partners in the company were John Tennant, eldest son of industrialist Charles Tennant, and John Tennent, whose father Hugh Tennent had helped run the Tennent family's Wellpark Brewery. Hugh Ronalds, a brother of Edmund Ronalds, later also became a partner at Bonnington. Edmund finally closed the works in 1878, when he was suffering extended ill health and Tennent and Tennant had died. == Research and publication == Ronalds‚Äô doctoral research was in the field of agricultural and physiological chemistry. Analysing wax by oxidation he created succinic acid, and published the results in Liebig's journal. He discovered taurine in human bile, which was announced in the Chemical Gazette (1846). That same year his important paper on urine was read to the Royal Society: he found that urine contained sulphur and phosphorus in both unoxidised and oxidised states and quantified the amounts. The results were of value for clinical urine tests. In 1848 he and Thomas Richardson translated and edited Friedrich Ludwig Knapp's book Chemical Technology. The first volumes of a much enlarged second edition were published in 1855. Later volumes in the period to 1867 were written by Richardson and Henry Watts, Ronalds having moved to Bonnington, and a third edition was published in 1889‚Äì1903. The book was recognised as a standard text and helped introduce the study of chemical technology at universities in Britain and beyond. As secretary of the Chemical Society, he edited the first two volumes of the Journal of the Chemical Society for 1849 and 1850. In 1852 he published an analysis of the oil of the basking shark, emphasising its unusual and valuable properties. While running the Bonnington works, he read a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1864 on the volatile components of Pennsylvanian light petroleum. He isolated several simple hydrocarbons dissolved in the crude - ethane, propane and butane - and described the properties of the last, also for the first time. Other research conducted at the firm was published in Georg Lunge‚Äôs treatise on the distillation of coal tar. When he retired from business, he established a private research laboratory which any chemist was welcome to use. == Family and death == Ronalds married John Tennent's sister Barbara Christian Tennent on 23 December 1850 and they had three sons and three daughters. They advanced funding to enable their eldest son, chemist Edmund Hugh Ronalds, to purchase the Live Oak Plantation in Florida where he wintered each year. On his death, it passed to his brother Dr Tennent Ronalds, an obstetrician, who enjoyed hunting and fishing there and at the Orchard Pond Plantation he also purchased. Ronalds died at his home Bonnington House on 9 September 1889 and was buried in Rosebank Cemetery nearby; the grave is just south of the main eastwest path. ==References== * ;Attribution Category:1819 births Category:1889 deaths Category:English chemists Category:Fellows of the Chemical Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ","title":"Edmund Ronalds"},{"id":"35282843","text":"The Kimberley tramway network formed part of the public transport system in Kimberley, Northern Cape, South Africa, for roughly 60 years until the late 1940s. Operation started with horse-drawn trams, on 21 June 1887. Mules replaced the horses in the early 1890s. For a few years starting in 1900 tram sets hauled by steam tram engines were also operated on some lines. The first day of public service for electric trams was 25 April 1905. The first electric trams were four single-deck cars purchased from the John Stephenson Car Company, of New York. More trams were purchased later from the J. G. Brill Company and the United Electric Car Company. Lines were gradually electrified, but not until 1914 were the last mule trams taken out of use, upon conversion of the Kennilworth route to electric trams. The last day of service was 30 November 1947, with the closure of the Kennilworth route. ==Heritage tramway== The tram at Market Square in 2007 A heritage tram line opened in 1985, on a line connecting City Hall with the Open Mine Museum, located on the De Beers Consolidated Mining Company premises, passing the \\"Big Hole\\" (Kimberley Mine) along the way.Russell, Mike (April 2009). \\"Lament for the Tram to Kimberley Mine\\". Tramways & Urban Transit, pp. 156‚Äì157. UK: LRTA Publishing. It was designed as an attraction for museum visitors. Service began in October 1985, using a single tram: Open-sided, four-wheel car number 1, built in 1905 for the Kimberley & Alexandersfontein Electric Railway by the John Stephenson Company. It had been converted into \\"tower car\\" (overhead wire maintenance car) No. 4 in the mid-1920s, and was reconverted into a passenger car in 1983‚Äì1985, for use on the heritage tramway. The line is entirely single-track and includes street running along Church Street and roadside running along the old Pniel Road and North Circular Road. Service on the line was suspended from 2005 until November 2006, during renovation of the museum. Service was suspended again in 2008, when erosion of the sides of the Big Hole led city officials to close Pniel Road to all traffic, for safety reasons. There was also a need to upgrade the braking systems on the tram, along with other issues. There was a possibility that the line might never reopen, but service resumed in June 2010. ==See also== *History of Kimberley, Northern Cape *List of town tramway systems in Africa *Rail transport in South Africa *Transport in Kimberley, Northern Cape ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== Category:Kimberley, Northern Cape Category:Passenger rail transport in South Africa Kimberley Category:Transport in the Northern Cape Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in South Africa Kimberley ","title":"Trams in Kimberley, Northern Cape"},{"id":"35282848","text":"Alexander Schnitger (November 11, 1958 ‚Äì June 27, 2020) was a general in the Royal Netherlands Air Force who served as Commander of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. ==Biography== Schnitger was born in Rotterdam,and received his military education at the Military Academy in Breda.

Sparsely populated because of its harsh environment, its grassland biodiversity includes thousands of species. ==Geography== A satellite view of the valley. It is located between the smaller lake Rukwa and the southeast of the larger Lake Tanganyika The valley lies at an elevation of above sea level. It is located between Lake Nyasa and Lake Tanganyika. Its low southeastern edge includes the shallow, alkaline Lake Rukwa, which is fringed by the North and Central Rukwa plains. The valley is to the northwest of Mbeya, and stretches as far as Karema and the Luakuga Gap. It is bounded to the east and west by high escarpments, apart. The Rukwa Rift is wide and in length. The valley also includes the Kafufu, the Myakaliza, the Magamba, the Ambala and the Luhumuka Rivers. ==Climate== Seasonal differences are extreme. The Rukwa's location within the tropics accounts for its one rainy season. Rainfall occurs during the months of November through April, and can vary between . Because of the only slight variations in grade, flooding is common. Conversely, the dry months of May through October are arid, and in comparison to the cooler Ufipa Plateau, the valley is hot. ==Wildlife== There are three main flora zones in the Rukwa Valley: the treeless grass plains, a belt of open woodland, and the escarpment area. Valley grassland and wooded grassland are differentiated by the illuvial soil of the former and the colluvial soil of the latter. The woodland is partly covered by acacia. The northern end of Lake Rukwa encompasses a wetland of papyrus and reed. The grasslands are inhabited by a rich biodiversity of thousands of species and a rich variety of birds. It has a significant population of topi in particular and some groups of some 1500 have been reported in clusters in the valley. Estimates in the 1950s were that some 3000-4000 topi roamed the land around Lake Rukwa. The abundant grassland in the valley has been described a \\"mecca for grazers\\". Several mutations have been reported in the valley including an albino giraffe and a dark coloured zebra \\"marked with spots instead of stripes\\". Other game animals include eland, reedbuck, and buffalo. The valley is home to some rare animals, including poku and Shoebill. In 1939, A. Lea and Dirk van Velden Webb noted a relationship between locusts and the valley's grassland. Lake Rukwa, which has no outlet, contains a large crocodile population. The Uwanda Game Reserve, Rukwa Game Reserve and Lukwati Game Reserve are amongst the protected areas in the valley. ==Population== The Rukwa is sparsely populated, with an economy revolving around agriculture, cattle keeping and fishing. An important rice- producing area, the main crops are maize and paddy. Garden crops include beans, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes; bananas, mangoes, lemons, pineapples, sesame, and sugar cane are grown as well. There is an influx of Sukuma cattle. Human cases of anthrax was noted in 1985 to be a \\"persistent problem\\" stemming from cattle consumption. ==References== Category:Valleys of Tanzania Category:Geography of Rukwa Region ","title":"Rukwa Valley"},{"id":"35282865","text":"Koreans in Thailand consist mainly of North Korean refugees and South Korean expatriates, along with a tiny number of South Korean immigrants who have naturalised as citizens of Thailand and their descendants. According to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in 2013 there were about 20,000 Koreans living in the country. ==Overview== North Korean refugees North Korean defectors often pass through Thailand on their way to South Korea. Thailand's Chiang Rai province is a popular entry point for North Korean defectors into the country. Most of these defectors have escaped economic hardship in North Korea and traveled to Thailand for temporary refuge in the hope of being able to resettle in third countries, usually South Korea. Thailand is the easiest route to access and the most accommodating, compared to Mongolia and Vietnam, where border security is tighter and in some cases, those fleeing have been sent back to North Korea to face harsh punishment. South Korean expatriates A variety of factors have drawn South Korean expatriates to Thailand including the country's golf courses, as well as the cuisine, the weather, and business opportunities. There were an estimated 20,000 South Korean nationals or former nationals in Thailand as of 2011. Among them, 53 had obtained Thai nationality, 114 were permanent residents, 2,735 were international students, and the remaining 16,000-odd South Korean residents had other kinds of visas. Their population fell by about 13 percent from 20,200 since 2009. 14,900 live in Bangkok, 2,000 in Chiang Mai, 1,800 in Phuket Province, and 1,300 in Chonburi Province. Their community exhibits a significantly lopsided sex ratio, with 11,843 men as compared to just 8,657 women, a ratio of about 1.4:1. Bangkok has a Koreatown in the Sukhumvit Plaza area near Sukhumvit Soi 12. Phuket also has a Koreatown and numerous Korean restaurants. There has been controversy over South Koreans working as tour guides without holding proper employment visas. The Tourism Authority of Thailand, the Korean Association in Phuket, and the South Korean consulate in Phuket signed an agreement in 2007 to promote the hiring of Thai tour guides instead. Korean culture is popular throughout the country thanks to the Korean Wave. ==Education and language== There is also a South Korean school in Bangkok, the Korean International School of Bangkok. South Korean children born in Thailand to South Korean expatriates show little language shift towards Thai. ==Religion== There were two Korean Buddhist temples and thirteen Korean Christian churches in Bangkok as of 2008. The Korean Union Church at Ratchadaphisek Road is the most popular. The average Korean church in Bangkok has an attendance of about one to two hundred worshippers. ==In popular culture== Thai martial arts film The Kick follows a family of South Korean Taekwondo experts who move to Thailand. ==Notable people== * Aree Song, South Korean professional golfer * Naree Song, South Korean professional golfer * Park Jongbae, South Korean singer.

Directed by Willis Goldbeck, it introduced two new doctors, Dr. Randall Adams (Van Johnson) and Dr. Lee Wong How (Keye Luke). ==Plot summary== Physically challenged Dr. Leonard Gillespie at the Blair General Hospital is exhausted from extensive work hours, to the point that his friends see the need for an intervention. They force him to get an assistant. Gillespie is quite picky, and only three young doctors at the hospital can answer the hard quiz question he asks to make his selection: Dr. Lee Wong How from Brooklyn, Dr. Randall Adams from Kansas City and Dr. Dennis Lindsay from Woolloomooloo, Australia. Gillespie takes them all three as temporary assistants until he can decide which one he will make his regular. At the same time, the son of Gillespie's dear old friend, Howard Allwin Young, is at an inn with his new wife, clothes designer Claire Merton. All of a sudden Claire loses her memory, and can't tell who she is anymore. Howard brings Claire to the hospital and Gillespie and his new assistants start working to solve the case of her sudden memory loss. They find no signs of physical or emotional trauma that could have caused it, and when the night comes, Claire wants to annul the marriage instead of going home with Howard to their home. Claire gets to go home with one of the assistants, Dr. \\"Red\\" Adams, but the next day she is no closer to regaining her memory than the day before. The only explanation that seems plausible to Gillespie is that Claire is just pretending. He decides to dig deeper into the reasons to why she would do that, and they locate her personal physician to find out more about her medical history. When visiting the physician's office they discover he has enlisted in the Army. Because of the confidentiality they only get the basic personal data regarding Claire, but it states that she is a married woman with a young child. Claire faints when confronted with this information back at the hospital. She reveals that she married in Texas at the young age of sixteen. Her husband turned out to be a criminal and later died. She left her baby with her mother and left for New York, where she had success in the fashion industry. When she met Howard she was ashamed to tell him about her history. This was the reason for faking the amnesia. Claire decides to move back to Texas and her child, and asks Gillespie and Red not to tell Howard what they have found out. They agree, but don't buy the explanation Claire has given them in full. The next night Red manages to get more information from a file at Claire's former physician, after getting the receptionist drunk. The file says that she can't have any more children. Gillespie decides to intervene in the couple's affairs, and calls Howard to his office and tells him about Claire's predicament. Howard assures the doctor that he loves Claire despite her history and would welcome her child in his home. Then Gillespie opens the door to an adjoining room and Claire steps in. The couple reunite and since the other two assistants have solved another hard case while Red cracked this one, Gillespie decides to keep them all three as his permanent assistants.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/121/Dr-Gillespie-s-New-Assistant/ ==CastReception== According to MGM records the film earned $435,000 in the US and Canada and $238,000 elsewhere, making a profit of $125,000. ==References* * Category:1942 films Category:1942 drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Willis Goldbeck Category:Films scored by Daniele Amfitheatrof Category:Films set in New York City Category:Hospital films Category:Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer films ","title":"Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant"},{"id":"35282938","text":"The 70th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 5 to December 15, 1847, during the first year of John Young's governorship, in Albany. ==Background== Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1821, 32 Senators were elected on general tickets in eight senatorial districts for four-year terms. They were divided into four classes, and every year eight Senate seats came up for election. Assemblymen were elected countywide on general tickets to a one- year term, the whole Assembly being renewed annually. On May 13, 1845, an \\"Act recommending a Convention of the people of this State\\" was passed, submitting at the next State election to the people the question whether they wanted to call a convention to amend the State Constitution. At the State election in November 1845, the question was answered in the affirmative. The Constitutional convention met from June 1 to October 9, 1846. The amended Constitution abolished rotative renewal of the Senate, required all legislators to be elected in single districts, made the State cabinet offices elective by popular ballot, and made major changes in the judicial system. The new Constitution was submitted to the electorate at the next State election for ratification. On March 30, 1846, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly districts: Chautauqua, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Madison, Ontario and Wyoming counties lost one seat each; Albany, Erie, Kings and St. Lawrence counties gained one seat each; and New York City gained three seats. The total number of assemblymen remained 128.Laws of New York (1846; \\"An Act for the apportionment of the members of the Assembly of this State\\"; pg. 48ff) On May 13, 1846, the Legislature re-apportioned the Senate districts: Kings County was transferred from the 1st to the 2nd District; Ulster County from the 2nd to the 3rd District; and Schenectady County from the 3rd to the 4th District.Laws of New York (1846; \\"An Act for the arrangement of Senate Districts\\"; pg. 468f) At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. The Democratic Party was split into two factions: the \\"Barnburners\\" and the \\"Hunkers.\\" The radical abolitionists appeared as the Liberty Party. The Anti-Rent Party nominated some candidates, but mostly cross-endorsed Whigs or Democrats, according to their opinion on the rent issue. The Whig state convention met on September 23 at Utica, and nominated Assemblyman John Young for Governor; and Hamilton Fish for Lieutenant Governor. The Democratic state convention met on October 1 at Syracuse, and nominated Gov. Silas Wright and Lt. Gov. Addison Gardner for re- election. The Anti-Rent state convention met in October at Beardsley's Hotel in Albany, and endorsed John Young (W) for Governor; and Lt. Gov. Addison Gardiner (D) for re-election. The Native American state convention nominated Ogden Edwards for Governor; and State Senator George Folsom for Lieutenant Governor.

Gov. Gardiner was elected to the Court of Appeals. State Senators Ira Harris and Augustus C. Hand; and Assemblyman William B. Wright were elected to the Supreme Court. On July 5, Lt. Gov. Gardiner took office on the Court of Appeals, and President pro tempore Albert Lester became Acting Lieutenant Governor. The Legislature met for a special session on September 8, 1847; and adjourned on December 15. On September 27, the Legislative passed \\"An Act to provide for the election of a Lieutenant Governor\\", to fill the vacancy at the next State election.

It can be realized in the complex projective plane as the set of inflection points of an elliptic curve, but it has no realization in the Euclidean plane. ==Description== The Hesse configuration has the same incidence relations as the lines and points of the affine plane over the field of 3 elements. That is, the points of the Hesse configuration may be identified with ordered pairs of numbers modulo 3, and the lines of the configuration may correspondingly be identified with the triples of points satisfying a linear equation . Alternatively, the points of the configuration may be identified by the squares of a tic-tac-toe board, and the lines may be identified with the lines and broken diagonals of the board. Each point belongs to four lines: in the tic tac toe interpretation of the configuration, one line is horizontal, one vertical, and two are diagonals or broken diagonals. Each line contains three points, so in the language of configurations the Hesse configuration has the notation 94123. The automorphism group of the Hesse configuration has order 216 and is known as the Hessian group. ==Related configurations== Removing any one point and its four incident lines from the Hesse configuration produces another configuration of type 8383, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration... In the Hesse configuration, the 12 lines may be grouped into four triples of parallel (non-intersecting) lines. Removing from the Hesse configuration the three lines belonging to a single triple produces a configuration of type 9393, the Pappus configuration.. The Hesse configuration may in turn be augmented by adding four points, one for each triple of non-intersecting lines, and one line containing the four new points, to form a configuration of type 134134, the set of points and lines of the projective plane over the three-element field. ==Realizability== The Hesse configuration can be realized in the complex projective plane as the 9 inflection points of an elliptic curve and the 12 lines through triples of inflection points. If a given set of nine points in the complex plane is the set of inflections of an elliptic curve C, it is also the set of inflections of every curve in a pencil of curves generated by C and by the Hessian curve of C, the Hesse pencil.. The Hessian polyhedron is a representation of the Hesse configuration in the complex plane. The Hesse configuration shares with the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration the property of having a complex realization but not being realizable by points and straight lines in the Euclidean plane. In the Hesse configuration, every two points are connected by a line of the configuration (the defining property of the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai configurations) and therefore every line through two of its points contains a third point. But in the Euclidean plane, every finite set of points is either collinear, or includes a pair of points whose line does not contain any other points of the set; this is the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem. Because the Hesse configuration disobeys the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem, it has no Euclidean realization. This example also shows that the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem cannot be generalized to the complex projective plane. However, in complex spaces, the Hesse configuration and all Sylvester‚ÄìGallai configurations must lie within a two-dimensional flat subspace.. ==References== Category:Configurations (geometry) Category:Elliptic curves ","title":"Hesse configuration"},{"id":"35282961","text":"This violin, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, may have been part of a set made for the marriage of Philip II of Spain to Elisabeth of Valois in 1559, which would make it one of the earliest known violins in existence. Andrea Amati was a luthier, from Cremona, Italy. Amati is credited with making the first instruments of the violin family that are in the form we use today. Several of his instruments survive to the present day, and some of them can still be played. Many of the surviving instruments were among a consignment of 38 instruments delivered to Charles IX of France in 1564. ==Charles IX of France== It is estimated that Amati made some 38 instruments between 1560 and 1574 for the Queen Regent of France Catherine de Medici on behalf of her young son, Charles IX of France; one of these was a gilded bass violin, elaborately painted with royal symbols, called The King. There is some uncertainty about the exact date the instrument was crafted; The King's \\"label\\" gives the date as 1572, but some scholars have proposed an earlier date. Much of the collection was destroyed during the French Revolution but some pieces were recovered by Giovanni Battista Viotti's student M. J. B. Cartier. It then changed hands several times, first being acquired by the Duport brothers, Jean-Pierre and Jean-Louis. According to the instrument's documentation it was then purchased from Rembert Wurlitzer Co. in 1967 by Lawrence Witten. The King is currently part of the collection at the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota. ==Role in the development of the modern violin== Based on iconographic and literary evidence, the violin can be dated back to 1520. There is no agreement among scholars regarding the development of the early violin. The rebec, fiddle and violoncello are attested to in Gaudenzio Ferrari's frescoes at the church of Saronno and Madonna of the Orange Tree at the church of Vercelli. However, According to Sotheby's: > \\"There is no surviving identifiable precedent for the exquisitely refined > instruments that Amati made to the commission of Charles IX of France and > Pope Pius V from about 1566 onward. Technically he may have added a fourth > string to a louder, outdoor cousin of the viol that was intended to > accompany dance music. Artistically he changed everything.\\" Sotheby's says \\"Amati's brilliance raised the status of the violin from a farmhand's entertainment to an embellishment fit for a royal court. According to a biography by Roger Hargrave, Amati is one of the top candidates scholars have advanced for the inventor of the violin. The two other candidates he named were Fussen born in a region now part of present-day Germany. The other candidate he named was Gasparo' da Salo from Brescia. The violin-like instruments that existed when Amati began his career only had three strings. Amati is credited with creating the first four stringed violin-like instrument. Laurence Witten also lists Amati and Gasparo' da Salo, as well as Pellegrino de' Micheli, also from Brescia; as well and Ventura di Francesco de' Machetti Linarol, of Venice. Amati's first violins were smaller than modern violins, with high arches, wide purfling, and elegantly curved scrolls and bodies. Andrea Amati's two sons, Antonio Amati and Girolamo Amati, were also highly skilled violin makers, as was his grandson Nicol√≤ Amati, who had over a dozen highly regarded apprentices, including Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri.

Gee mostly painted battle scenes, landscapes as well as pictures inspired by local legends such as Lady Godiva. He was active as a painter between the years of 1815 and 1868. He died in 1871 or 1872. In 1831, Gee began restoration work on the Holy Trinity Doom, an early 15th-century painting of the Last Judgment. He received five guineas for his work. There is little contemporary information about Gee's work on the Doom, but conservation work begun in 1995 suggests he added outlines to the figures and repainted or recoloured some areas. There is no evidence that Gee significantly changed the painting's composition or symbolism. Gee also applied a coating of megilp to the painting. This bituminous varnish soon degraded and by 1873 the Doom was 'almost invisible'. ==References * Category:1793 births Category:19th-century British painters Category:British male painters Category:1872 deaths Category:19th- century male artists ","title":"David Gee (artist)"},{"id":"35283006","text":"√Ölenius 2012.

Each curve in the family is determined by a pair of parameter values (\\\\lambda,\\\\mu) (not both zero) and consists of the points in the plane whose homogeneous coordinates (x,y,z) satisfy the equation for those parameters. Multiplying both \\\\lambda and \\\\mu by the same scalar does not change the curve, so there is only one degree of freedom in selecting a curve from the pencil, but the two-parameter form given above allows either \\\\lambda or \\\\mu (but not both) to be set to zero. Each curve in the pencil passes through the nine points of the complex projective plane whose homogeneous coordinates are some permutation of 0, ‚Äì1, and a cube root of unity. There are three roots of unity, and six permutations per root, giving 18 choices for the homogeneous coordinates of each point, but they are equivalent in pairs giving only nine points. The family of cubics through these nine points forms the Hesse pencil. More generally, one can replace the complex numbers by any field containing a cube root of unity and define the Hesse pencil over this field to be the family of cubics through these nine points. The nine common points of the Hesse pencil are the inflection points of each of the cubics in the pencil. Any line that passes through at least two of these nine points passes through exactly three of them; the nine points and twelve lines through triples of points form the Hesse configuration. Every elliptic curve is birationally equivalent to a curve of the Hesse pencil; this is the Hessian form of an elliptic curve.

Bunney's work as an artist matured under the influence of William Milnes, who became the headmaster at Coventry School of Art in 1906.Clarke 1999 Milnes encouraged students to follow the example of Turner by taking quick sketches under differing conditions. This, according to Milnes, would give the artist a greater understanding of nature in its various moods. Many of Coventry's medieval buildings had survived up to the early 20th century, and Milnes pointed out that many of the buildings were suitable for studies on the effect of light.Clarke 1999 Several students took up this idea, including H. E. Cox, and Bunney became a prolific painter of Coventry scenes. His body of work records the city as a market town, the streets lined with red-brick and half-timbered shops and houses.Bell, Lucy, Coventry Evening Telegraph, 17 December 1999 Most of these pieces are small and intimate works of art. He had great difficulty in having his work exhibited at any of the big shows, such as those at the Royal Academy, and interest in his work largely waned before he was rediscovered in the late 20th century.Clarke 1999 Bunney became a cashier at the Auto Machinery Company Limited in Coventry and in his later years lived at 154 Albany Road, Earlsdon.Clarke 1999 ==References==  Further reading  * Category:1877 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:English artists Category:People from Coventry Category:Alumni of Coventry School of Art and Design ","title":"Sydney John Bunney"},{"id":"35283206","text":"The Luhumuka is a river of southwestern Tanzania.

At the age of 18 he arrived at the imperial court in Vienna, where he was given command of a cavalry regiment with 1000 horses. A short time later he went to Burgundy, where he worked for the Elector Palatine Frederick II as ambassador to various courts. In 1557, he was sent to the Diet of Regensburg, where he acted as imperial councillor to King Ferdinand I, despite being a Protestant himself. He later represented Emperor Maximilian II at several diets. In 1559, he was appointed as presented of the Aulic Council. Archduke Charles II of Styria appointed him governor of Carinthia, Carniola and Styria. Louis possessed the County of L√∂wenstein, which was under the sovereignty of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. On 3 September 1566, he married Countess Anna of Stolberg (1548‚Äì1599), the daughter of Count Louis of Stolberg. He had originally sought to marry Anna's older sister Catherine, who was married to Michael III, the last count of Wertheim. After Michael III died in 1566, Louis of Stolberg inherited Wertheim. When he died in 1574 without a male heir, the Lordship of Rochefort fell to his daughter Anna. A dispute broke out between his sons-in-law over the County of Wertheim. Louis III styled himself Count of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim from 1580 onwards, however, it took 1598 until he could actually secure possession of Wertheim. Louis of Stolberg's sons-in-law took turns governing the County of Stolberg. These sons-in-law were Louis III, who was married to Anna, the youngest sister, and Count Philip of Eberstein, who had married Catherine, the eldest sister, and Count Dietrich of Manderscheid, who had married, Elisabeth the second sister. After Philip died in 1589 in Remlingen and Dietrich died in 1593 in Schleiden, Louis hoped to rule Stolberg alone. However, Elisabeth then married William of Krichingen, who was a Catholic and who disputed Louis III claims on Stolberg until he died in 1610. == Issue == Louis III and Anna had four sons and seven daughters. Their sons were: * Christopher Louis (3 May 1568 ‚Äì 17 February 1618), married in 1592 to Countess Elisabeth Amalie of Manderscheid-Schleiden (27 July 1569 ‚Äì 26 October 1621), the heiress of the County of Virneburg. Christopher Louis and Elisabeth Amalie founded the Protestant L√∂wenstein- Wertheim-Virneburg line, which was raised to Princes of Loewenstein-Wertheim- Freudenberg in 1812 * Louis IV (30 May 1569 ‚Äì 24 August 1635), married: *# in 1605 Gertrude of Schutzbar genannt Milchling *# in 1634 Countess Juliana of Wied-Runkel (b. , the daughter of Count William IV of Wied-Runkel (1560‚Äì1612) and Johanna Sibylla of Hanau-Lichtenberg (1564‚Äì1636) * Wolfgang Ernest (5 August 1578 ‚Äì 26 May 1636), married in 1625 to Countess Barbara of Hohenlohe- Waldenburg (22 June 1592 ‚Äì March 1665) * Johann Dietrich, Count of L√∂wenstein- Wertheim-Rochefort (31 January 1585 ‚Äì 6 March 1644), married in 1610 to Josina de la Marck (3 January 1583 ‚Äì 26 February 1626). He was the founder of the Catholic line of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. == Legacy == Louis III tried to regulate the succession after his death in the of 1597.

It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 May 2012 as the album's second and final single. \\"Let It Go\\" is an uptempo 90s throwback dance song drawing influences from the dance-pop and R&B; genres. \\"Let It Go\\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who deemed the song the best song on the album, along with its catchy tune and production; however, minority of critics found the song generic. The song was unable to match the success like \\"Elephant\\", only peaking inside the UK Top 40. ==Background and release== In an interview with Peter Robinson for Popjustice, Burke explained the song's conception and development. Burke revealed that she did not co-write the song, but was involved with the writing camp, a series of sessions where writers and producers met Burke in order to create material for Heartbreak on Hold, and that \\"Let It Go\\" was written during the sessions. She explained the meaning behind the song's lyrics, saying: On 13 April 2012, \\"Let It Go\\" premiered on the Kiss radio station, and serves as Heartbreak on Holds official second single. \\"Let It Go\\" was made available to download via iTunes on 25 May 2012 in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as multiple other European countries. It was released as an extended play (EP) and consists of \\"Let It Go\\"; \\"Let It Go\\" (Bimbo Jones Remix); \\"Let It Go\\" (Rui da Silva Remix) and \\"Let It Go\\" (Digital Dog Remix); each version can be purchased individually or all together. ==Composition== Burke sings the lyric \\"We get caught up in the little things/ Lose ourselves along the way\\" \\"over feather-light club beats\\" according to Robert Copsey for DigitalSpy. The chorus is reminiscent of 90s music. ==Critical reception== Robert Copsey for Digital Spy was complimentary of the 90s inspired song, writing that although it is \\"a smidge predictable,\\" it is difficult to not admire Burke's enthusiasm on \\"Let It Go\\". Copsey continued to write that despite the song being about not being stressed and chanting \\"Let it go\\", Burke does not \\"[put] her feet up with a cuppa.\\" Jenny Mensah from 4Music called the song the \\"most stand-out tune for its catchiness alone\\", however in-compare to the studio album \\"[...]Unfortunately, this is because the other tracks fail to grab us in the same way.\\" Matt Collar from Allmusic said tracks like \\"Let it Go\\" and \\"Fire\\"; \\"have an infectious house music sound that brings to mind the contemporary dance-pop of Lady Gaga as much as classic '90s diva house artists like Robin S.\\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0002355993 Caroline Sullivan for The Guardian was critical of the song, writing that it is \\"anonymous international dancefloor fodder\\". Rohin Guha for Flavorpill wrote about the message behind the song: \\"It‚Äôs not surprising the [Dalai Lama]'s words resonate with a subcategory of zen pop, which embraces the spirit of \\"letting go\\" in order to properly celebrate life.\\" ==Music video== The music video for \\"Let It Go\\" was shot on London Underground on 7 April 2012. The video was released on 25 April 2012 via Burke's official VEVO account. The video starts with a blue Audi R8 pulling over, playing her previous single, \\"Elephant\\". Burke steps out of the car and walks towards a London Underground station. It is at this point where the song begins to play. During the first chorus, Burke makes her way down to the platform. At the end of the first chorus, Burke steps onto a train and sits down right at the rear of the carriage. During the second verse, she stands up and calls all the passengers to dance, including a businessman and a professional dancer. She walks through to the very front of the train and it is at the front carriage where Burke and her team start to dance in the carriage. Burke then continues to dance in an empty car park, where she and her team perform a further dance routine. The video finishes with Burke and her dancers posing in the car park. ==Live performances== Burke performed an acoustic version of the song on Loose Women in 2012, and also performed the song on series finale of The Voice of Ireland on 29 April 2012. Burke also performed \\"Let It Go\\" on breakfast television show Lorraine on 22 May 2012, where she also gave an interview about the song and Heartbreak on Hold. ==Track listing== *Digital download # Let It Go ‚Äì 3:28 *Digital EP # Let It Go ‚Äì 3:28 # Let It Go (Bimbo Jones Remix) ‚Äì 3:15 # Let It Go (Rui da Silva Remix) ‚Äì 7:53 # Let It Go (Digital Dog Remix) ‚Äì 7:38 ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording locations *Recorded at Cutfather Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark. *Mixed at White Room, Copenhagen, Denmark. ;Personnel *Songwriting ‚Äì Jason Gill, Mich Hansen, Belle Humble *Production ‚Äì Cutfather, Jason Gill *Vocal engineering and recording ‚Äì Jason Gill *Mixing ‚Äì Mads Nilsson *Instruments and programming ‚Äì Jason Gill *Percussion ‚Äì Mich Hansen Credits adapted from the liner notes of Heartbreak on Hold; Syco Music, Sony Music, RCA Records. ==Chart performance== \\"Let It Go\\" made its first appearance on the Irish Singles Chart, where it debuted at number 41 on 31 May 2012, becoming her lowest charting single.

The dedication is to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. ==History== The present cathedral, built in 1687 by architect Domenico Spotorno, was constructed on the ruins of an earlier church built at the expense of Donna Violante Carroz, Marchioness of Quirra (1456-1510), at the time of the transfer of the seat of the diocese of Usellus to Ales. The first cathedral had a Romanesque nave with a truss roof and a small bell tower, three chapels (dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Our Lady of the Rosary, and the Crucifix), and a sacristy, which was replaced by a new one in 1627. The building was enlarged in 1634, probably with walling of large blocks of white stone, and four additional chapels. In the time of Bishop Brunengo the nave and the apse were covered with barrel vaulting. In 1648 Brunengo started building one of two planned towers, but it collapsed on April 29, 1683, for reasons never discovered, and in its fall almost completely destroyed the rest of the church. Construction of the present cathedral was begun in 1687 to plans drawn up by the architect Domenico Spotorno, who had died on June 17, 1684, in Ales and was later buried in the new building. He had previously worked on the conversion of the Baroque cathedral of Cagliari, which served as a model for the cathedral of Ales. The new cathedral was completed after the death of Spotorno by the architect Ignatius Merigano, with the help of the master builders Antonio Cuccuru and Lucifero Marceddu of Cagliari. It was consecrated by Bishop Didoco (Domenico) Cugia on May 9, 1688. Along the boundary wall with the Chapel of San Michele and the clock tower, traces can still be seen of the tower that collapsed. The building was equipped during the 18th century with marble furnishings of good workmanship, by the sculptor Pietro Pozzo and his school. In the first half of the 20th century the decorations and frescoes of the interior were completed. Major renovations, in progress during some twenty years, have recently been completed. ==Description== Exterior The cathedral is located on a terrace overlooking a wide piazza, dominating the centre of the village. The west front, with a curved top, is framed by two bell towers, connected by a terrace equipped with a tufa balustrade, beneath which is a portico with a round arch. On the top of the fa√ßade is a statue of Saint Peter. Each tower has a cupola and behind is the great central dome over the crossing. Interior The cathedral has a Latin cross floorplan. The nave is 21 metres long and 10 metres wide, divided from the side-aisles by pilasters with Ionic capitals, with two side chapels and a large transept, the arms of which extend 7.80 metres. The choir is 10 metres long and 7.40 metres wide. The chapels and apse are barrel-vaulted, as are the nave and the transept, except of course at the crossing, which is roofed by the large octagonal dome (36 metres high), covered with decorations (1950-1962) and frescoes (1954), the more recent work by Peppinetto Boi Ales. The frescoes include, from left to right: the Martyrdom of Saint Peter; medallion of Saint Gregory the Great; the Glory of Saint Peter; medallion of Saint Ambrose; the Martyrdom of Saint Paul; medallion of Saint Augustine; the Glory of Saint Paul; and a medallion of Saint Jerome. The central vault is 16 metres high, and the two towers are 26 metres high. The vaults are decorated with frescoes (1907) by Giovanni da Ferraboschi of Bergamo, depicting the main incidents of the lives of Saints Peter and Paul, with relief decoration on coffering using classical motifs such as rosettes, leaves, heraldic emblems (a papal tiara and a bishop's mitre), as well as Celtic knotwork with grotesque faces. The decorations on the walls of the cathedral, including simulated inlaid polychrome marble, were made at the end of the 1950s by the decorator Enrico Lorrai of Cagliari (1908-1995). The floors have almost all been remade, firstly between 1950 and 1962 during the episcopate of Bishop Antonio Tedde and secondly between 1983 and 2003 during the episcopates of Bishops Gibertini and Orr√π. ==Sources== * Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Italy Category:Churches in the province of Oristano ","title":"Ales Cathedral (Sardinia)"},{"id":"35283417","text":"The Soni Falls is a waterfall in the Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania, near the village of Soni, to the northeast of Kitunda.

It operates over 65 facilities in 17 countries. ==History== Early history In 1909, German immigrant Otto Kolschowsky opened a family meat market in Oak Park, Illinois two years after his arrival in the United States. In 1917, he expanded into the wholesale meat trade and relocated the business to nearby Maywood, another Chicago suburb. The company became known as Otto & Sons in 1928. Over several decades, Otto & Sons established a local reputation for offering quality meats. Harold and Gerry Kolschowsky, along with Sheldon Lavin, were influential in expanding the company to what it is today. In 1955, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois with Otto & Sons as the supplier of fresh ground beef patties. When Cryogenic food processing, a method of preserving fresh food through liquid nitrogen freezing, emerged in the late 1960s, Otto & Sons accepted Kroc's offer to become one of McDonald's four meat suppliers. Later, a fifth supplier was added. In 1973, Otto & Sons opened its first high- volume meat plant in West Chicago with specially developed patty-forming machines and liquid nitrogen freezing tunnels. At the same time, it formed a separate unit called Glenmark, for all non-McDonald's business. In 1975, the company changed its name to OSI Industries. Glenmark was later acquired by Best Chicago Meat Co. in 2011. Expansion In 1990, OSI partnered with General Milling Corporation and Alaska Milk Corporation to establish GenOSI, a Philippines food processing company. In 2002, OSI China was established in Beijing. In 1995, OSI entered the India market with the creation of its subsidiary, Vista Processed Foods. OSI acquired chicken company Moy Park in 1996. Moy Park was later sold to Marfrig Group in 2008. OSI acquired G W Padley Poultry and Dove Valley in 2004. In 2006, OSI acquired poultry processor Amick Farms.

Starting her career as an assistant to Marie Curie, she became a pioneer in radiochemistry, establishing the half-life of radium and helping demonstrate the existence of isotopes.'Ellen Gleditsch', Encyclopedia of World Biography. Reprinted online at bookrags.com. ==Life== Gleditsch was born in 1879 in Mandal, Norway. Although she graduated from high school at the top of her class, the college entrance exams were not available to women at the time. Therefore, she worked as a pharmacy assistant where she was able to work toward a non-academic degree in chemistry and pharmacology in 1902. In 1905 with the support of her mentor Eyvind B√∏dtker, she passed the university entrance exam, but chose to study in Paris. After starting her career in pharmacy, she went on to study radioactivity at the Sorbonne and work in Marie Curie's laboratory from 1907 to 1912. At Curie's lab, Gleditsch performed a technique called fractional crystallisations, which purified radium. The work, which was highly specialized and few could complete, allowed her laboratory fees to be waived. She spent five years of analysis with Curie and returned even after leaving the lab to supervise experiments. In 1911, she received a \\"Licenci√©e en sciences degree\\" from the Sorbonne and was awarded a teaching post at University of Oslo. After working one year, she won the first scholarship ever given to a woman from the American-Scandinavian Association to study in the United States, but was turned down by both of the schools at which she applied. She went anyway and despite having been rejected was able to work at the laboratory of Bertram Boltwood at Yale University, where she measured the half-life of radium, creating a standard measurement that was used for many years. One of the scientists who had originally turned her away from Yale, co-authored two articles with her and in June 1914, Smith College awarded her an honorary doctorate for her work. In 1913‚Äì14, she returned to the University of Oslo and became the second woman to be elected to Oslo‚Äòs Academy of Science in 1917. During the 1920s, Gleditsch made several trips to France to assist Curie, as well as a trip to Cornwall to investigate a mine located there. In 1919, Gleditsch co-founded the Norwegian Women Academics' Association, to focus on development of science and the conditions under which women scientists worked. She also believed that cooperation of scientists would foster peace. She served as president of the organization from 1924 to 1928.\\"Rayner-Canham (1997)\\", p 66 Joining the International Federation of University Women in 1920, she served as its President from 1926 to 1929,Gleditsch, Ellen, Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics, UCLA working to provide scholarships to enable women to study abroad. In 1929, she made a trip to the United States traveling from New York to California with the intention of promoting scholarships for women. Though her appointment as professor at Oslo in 1929 caused controversy, she successfully started a radioactivity research group there. Throughout the 1930s, she continued to produce articles in English, French, German and Norwegian. She also hosted a series of radio shows to promote and popularize scientific study.\\"Rayner- Canham (1997)\\", p 69 In the 1930s she directed, a laboratory doing radiochemistry in Norway, which was used as an underground laboratory by scientists fleeing from the Nazi regime. In 1939, she was appointed to the International committee on intellectual cooperation, where Marie Curie had also been sitting a few years earlier. pp. 292. When Norway was occupied during the war, she hid scientists and continued using her home for experiments. During a raid on her laboratory in 1943, the women scientists were able to rescue the radioactive minerals, but all of the men were arrested. She retired from the university in 1946 and began working with UNESCO in their efforts to end illiteracy. In 1949, she was actively involved on the working committee and in 1952 was named to the Norwegian commission working to control use of the atomic bomb. That same year she resigned from UNESCO in protest over the admittance of Spain under Franco's fascist regime as a member.\\"Rayner-Canham (1997)\\", p 72 In 1962 at the age of 83, she received an honorary doctorate from the Sorbonne, the first woman to receive such an honor.\\"Rayner-Canham (1997), p 73\\" ==Works== * (with Marie Curie) * Sur le radium et l'uranium contenus dans les mineraux radioactifs, Comptes Rendus 148:1451 (1909) * 'Ratio Between Uranium and Radium in the Radio-active Minerals', Comptes Rendus 149:267 (1909). * Sur le rapport entre l'uranium et le radium dans les mineraux actifs, Radium 8:256 (1911). * ==References * Ellen Gleditsch at the Journal of Chemical Education ==Further reading== * * * Category:1879 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Norwegian chemists Category:Norwegian women scientists Category:Nuclear chemists Category:Norwegian women chemists Category:20th- century women scientists Category:People associated with the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation Category:Norwegian Association for Women's Rights people ","title":"Ellen Gleditsch"},{"id":"35283557","text":"The Jersey Half Marathon (currently known as the \\"Run Jersey Half Marathon\\") is an annual half marathon staged in the north west of Jersey, Channel Islands. ==History== The event was organised by the Jersey Hash House Harriers from 1989, until 2011.http://www.jerseyhalf.com/ Run Jersey took over organising the event from 2012. ==The course== The course is set over the parishes of St. John, St. Lawrence, St. Mary, and St. Ouen. ==Results== Men * 2012 -- Mavny Thomas ‚Üí 1:15:24Runners pass tough test Women * 2012 -- Jo Gorrod ‚Üí 1:22:59 ==See also== *Jersey Marathon *JSAC Half Marathon ==External linksReferences== Category:Sport in Jersey Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1989 Category:Half marathons Category:1989 establishments in Jersey Category:Spring (season) events in Jersey ","title":"Jersey Half Marathon"},{"id":"35283563","text":"John James O'Donovan, better known as Se√°n O'Donovan, (15 August 1893 ‚Äì 22 February 1975) was an Irish Fianna F√°il politician and Veterinarian.

The Regional Theatre Movement, in the late 1940s and 1950s, was the work of a small number of directors, actors and producers to develop a new expression of professional theatre as an alternative to Broadway.Zeigler, Joseph Wesley, Regional Theatre: The Revolutionary Stage, New York: Da Capo Press, 1977 \\"The early regional theatres ... started as reactions to the theatrical Establishment of their time ‚Äì Broadway ... They were the new, anti- Establishment revolution.\\"Zeigler, p.170 Zeigler identifies the Charles Playhouse as one of six theatres which were the foundations of the Regional Theatre Movement.Zeigler, \\"Acorns: Theatres before 1960\\", pp. 24-61, Note: founding theatres cited by Zeigler are Alley Theatre, Houston (1947), Mummers Theatre, Oklahoma City (1949), Arena Stage, Washington DC (1950), Actor's Workshop, San Francisco (1952), Milwaukee Repertory Company (1954), Front Theatre, Memphis (1954), and Charles Playhouse (1957) He described the humble beginnings of the movement's leaders and their theatres: \\"Zelda Fichandler (Arena Stage, Washington, DC) in a beer factory, Michael Murray (Charles Playhouse, Boston) above a fish market, or Jules Irving and Herbert Blau (the Actor's Workshop, San Francisco) behind a judo academy.\\"Zeigler, p. 71 In 1958, the Charles Playhouse moved from the fish market to an abandoned nightclub on Warrenton Street.
