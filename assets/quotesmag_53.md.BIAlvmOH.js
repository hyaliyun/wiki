It is a predominantly blue and white bird. It is found in Indonesia, New Guinea and coastal eastern and Northern Australia. Like many other kingfishers, it hunts invertebrates, small frogs, and lizards. Taxonomy The forest kingfisher was first described by the naturalists Sir William Jardine and Prideaux John Selby in 1830. It was known for many years by its old scientific name of Halcyon macleayi before being transferred to the genus Todiramphus. The generic name is derived from the genus Todus (Brisson, 1760), 'tody' (a West Indian insectivorous bird) and Ancient Greek rhamphos, 'bill'. The specific epithet honours the Scottish entomologist and Colonial Secretary to New South Wales Alexander Macleay (1767-1848). Three subspecies are recognised: *T. m. macleayi, the nominate subspecies, is found across the Top End eastwards to the Gulf of Carpentaria. *T. m. incinctus, described by John Gould, has a greener tinge to its back and is slightly larger. It is found down the east coast of Australia. *T. m. elisabeth (Heine, 1883) is found in eastern New Guinea.Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1).

Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. It has blue wings, head and tail with white breast, abdomen and nape. It has a white patch in front of the eyes and a black band stretching from the bill, through the eyes to the ear coverts. A white patch is visible on the wings in flight. The female is distinguished by a blue rather than white nape. The iris is dark brown and the legs and feet dark grey. Immature birds are duller with a blackish crown. The call is a shrill t-reek, repeated regularly, most often in the early morning. Distribution and habitat The forest kingfisher is native to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Australia, where it is found on or near the Australian coastline from Port Stephens in New South Wales northwards to Cape York and westwards across the Top End. It is a summer visitor in the southern parts of its range in New South Wales and southern Queensland; elsewhere it is resident all year round. As its name suggests, it inhabits subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and subtropical or tropical mangrove forest and Melaleuca swampland. Behaviour Feeding The forest kingfisher hunts invertebrates, such as bugs, beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, dragonflies, cicadas, ants, adult and larval butterflies, and worms, as well as small fish, frogs and tadpoles, lizards, and snakes. The forest kingfisher watches from a high perch, dives to the ground or water to seize its prey (sally-pouncing), then returns directly to the perch. It often kills prey by hitting it against a branch after seizing it. Breeding Breeding season is August to February in Australia with often two broods raised.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. The nest is a short burrow into a round chamber within an arboreal termite nest, around above the ground. Three to six (usually 4 or 5) white shiny eggs are laid, measuring . Both parents (and possibly any helpers present) incubate the eggs for 18 to 21 days. The fledging period is 27 to 31 days and fledglings are fed for around a month before they leave the nest. Conservation status Although the population trend of the forest kingfisher is decreasing, it is classed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The red-backed kingfisher is noisy when mating with a harsh alarm calls and parrot-like chatter given by birds near the nest. Distribution and habitat The red- backed kingfisher is native to most of Australia, except Tasmania and the extreme southwest and southeast of the mainland. It is a summer visitor to the southeast of the country; elsewhere it is resident all year round. It inhabits dry forests, mulga and mallee country, to spinifex and almost treeless country, often far from water. During breeding season, the red-backed kingfisher will move to river courses to make use of the earthy banks to dig nesting burrows. It appears to be partly migratory to the south of the continent for the breeding season, returning north in winter. It is moderately common to uncommon, due to its irregular nomadic movements, probably depending on the occurrence of erratic rainfall. Behaviour Breeding The breeding season is August to February, often with a double brood, although birds may not breed in times of drought. The nest is a burrow 0.5-1.25 m (18-50 in) into the top third section of a steep sloping bank overlooking a dry creek-bed or dam, or occasionally in an abandoned mine-shaft or hollow branch. They may vacate the site if the riverbed becomes inundated. Occasionally, nests may be situated in termite mounds in the north of the country. Two to six white, rounded, shiny eggs are laid, measuring . The eggs are incubated by both adults for 20-23 days, and after a further 26-30 days, fledglings are able to leave the nest. Threats to the nest are flooding by sudden downpours, and being dug up and eaten by goannas, dingoes and foxes. Feeding The red-backed kingfisher observes from a conspicuous perch in a tree or on overhead wires, then swoops to the ground to take its prey and return directly to its perch . Its diet consists of various insects (including locusts and grasshoppers, beetles, leaf-insects, ants and caterpillars), spiders, small crustaceans, centipedes, and scorpions. It also takes vertebrates, such as fish, frogs and tadpoles, lizards, snakes, and occasionally mouse-sized mammals. Conservation status The population trend of the red-backed kingfisher is increasing, and given its very extensive distribution, the species is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his coverage of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 by Lyndon B. Johnson. Background Albert Merriman Smith was born on February 10, 1913, in Savannah, Georgia. Career Known by his middle name (and his nickname, \\"Smitty\\"), Smith covered US presidents from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Richard Nixon and originated the practice of closing presidential news conferences with \\"Thank You, Mr. President,\\" which was the title of his 1946 book, written during his coverage of the Harry Truman administration. That honor, accorded the senior wire service reporter present at presidential news conferences, became more popularly known when it was continued by Smith's UPI colleague Helen Thomas. Smith began covering the White House in 1940. After the United States entered the Second World War, he was designated as one of the wire service reporters to follow the president on all his travels. They agreed for security purposes not to file their stories until after each trip had ended. Consequently, Smith was in Warm Springs, Georgia, on April 12, 1945, and filed one of the first reports on the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Donald A. Ritchie (2005), Reporting from Washington: The History of the Washington Press Corps, p. 121. On November 22, 1963, Smith was the main UPI reporter in Dallas for John F. Kennedy's visit. He traveled in the motorcade in the White House Pool car, which had a radiotelephone. When the shots were fired, Smith grabbed the phone and called the UPI office. He stayed on the phone while Jack Bell, the AP reporter in the car, started punching Smith and yelling at him to hand the phone over. At 12:34 PM CST, four minutes after the presidential shooting, the report went out over UPI wire. In 1964, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy. He was the first to publicly use the term \\"grassy knoll\\" regarding the assassination.Pages documenting this are held by Gary Mack, the curator of The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. In the 1960s, Smith was a frequent guest on television interview programs hosted by Jack Paar and Merv Griffin. Smith was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967. Death Despondent over the death of his son in the Vietnam War and perhaps suffering from PTSD as a result of witnessing the Kennedy assassination, Smith died at his home in Washington, D.C., on April 13, 1970 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Although he never served in the military himself, his grave is in Section 32 of Arlington National Cemetery next to his son's, by special permission of the Commanding General of the Military District of Washington. Legacy Part of his legacy is The Merriman Smith Memorial Award, a journalism award bestowed by the White House Correspondents' Association. Near the end of the novel Seven Days in May, by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W.

It is endemic to the Philippines, its natural habitat being lowland forests. It is threatened by deforestation, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as a vulnerable species. Taxonomy This species was described as Halcyon Winchelli by British ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877, using a specimen collected by American ornithologist Joseph Beal Steere. It was named after American geologist Newton Horace Winchell, as requested by Steere. Although two subspecies were later described, they were usually considered synonymous with the nominate before 1966. That year Kenneth C. Parkes studied a series of 45 specimens and recognised five subspecies, two of which were new. All five are still recognised: Todiramphus winchelli nigrorum found in the central and east- central Philippines, T. w. nesydrionetes in the north-central Philippines, T. w. mindanensis on Mindanao, T. w. winchelli on Basilan, and T. w. alfredi on the Sulu Archipelago in the southwest. Description Winchell's kingfisher is about long. The crown is blackish-blue, with cobalt-blue edges, and the lores and neck-collar are rufous. The upperparts are mostly blackish and dark blue, with a bright azure-blue rump. The underparts are white in the male, and buff in the female. The eyes are dark brown, the beak is black, and the legs are greyish. The juvenile bird is similar to the female, but with duller plumage. The subspecies are coloured different shades of blue. A black patch on the sides of the male's breast is conspicuous in subspecies nigrorum and concealed in others, and in nesydrionetes, the female has an orange breast forming a band between the whitish throat and belly. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to the Philippines, ranging from Samar and Tablas south to Mindanao, Basilan and the Sulu Archipelago. It appears to be locally common on some islands, but it is rare in other localities. It lives in forest below in elevation, being found in coastal lowlands and foothills. Its tolerance of degraded forest is uncertain. Behaviour This kingfisher often perches in the canopy and sometimes descends to lower perches and to the ground, probably to feed. One of its calls is an ascending series of harsh chup and chep notes, and another consists of three rising notes and then a long descending series chu chu chu chu. Loud sqawking has also been heard. It batters its prey, which consists of large insects, spiders and small vertebrates. Little is known about its breeding. Nesting in a used arboreal termite nest has been recorded. Status The population size is estimated at 2,500‚Äì9,999 mature individuals, or 3,500‚Äì15,000 individuals in total. Forest clearance and illegal logging are causing habitat loss and a fast population decline, so the IUCN has assessed it as a vulnerable species. This species has been recorded in some protected areas, such as Mount Guiting-Guiting and Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape.

It is found on Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic). Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest.  Taxonomy and systematics  The broad-billed tody belongs to the genus Todus, of the family Todidae, the suborder Alcedines, order Coraciiformes and class Aves. Originally, it was thought that broad- and narrow-billed todies shared a common ancestor and then split into two species, as they are the only tody species that share an island. However, mitochondrial DNA analysis has shown that the broad-billed tody descended from the Puerto Rican tody, while the narrow-billed tody descended from the Cuban tody, which was native to the island first. The ancestors of the broad-billed tody migrated to the island two to three million years ago, meaning they have always been distinct species. There has also been a question about where to place the family Todidae among other taxonomic groups, due to their similarities with other birds, such as the nightjars (Caprimulgidae), the trogons (Trogonidae), the puffbirds (Bucconidae), among others. In 1790, the genus Todus was established, to separate the todies from the kingfishers of genus Alcedo, with the order \\"Todiformes\\" being proposed in 1882 but rejected. Currently, in combination with DNA, geographical and evolutionary analysis, it is firmly believed that todies belong to the order Coraciiformes.

It was previously considered a subspecies (Upupa epops marginata) of the hoopoe, but was split due to its vocalisations and small differences in plumage. Some taxonomists still consider all three species conspecific. Some authorities also keep the African and Eurasian hoopoe together, but split the Madagascar hoopoe. It is endemic to Madagascar, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forest. It is a common bird and the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers its conservation status to be of least concern.  Description  The adult Madagascan hoopoe is about long and weighs . It has a long, decurved bill, and cinnamon-coloured plumage, the wings being boldly barred in black and white. The tail is black and a long, cinnamon crest with black-tipped feathers can be raised when the bird is alarmed. The wings are broad and rounded; the characteristic flight consists of a few beats after which the wings are folded momentarily and the bird glides, before resuming flapping. The female is slightly duller in colour than the male, with less white on the wings. Compared to the African hoopoe, it is larger, has a longer tail and a pinker throat. The song differs markedly from the African hoopoe's \\"hoop-hoop-hoop\\", being described as \\"a low cooing trill rrrrrrooow, dropping slightly, lasting 1.5‚Äì2.5 seconds, repeated every 3‚Äì10 seconds\\". Distribution and habitat The Madagascan hoopoe is endemic to Madagascar where its range includes the north, west, central and southern parts of the country, while it is largely absent from the east. It inhabits the edges of forests, clearings, glades, savannah, pasture and brushland. Ecology With spider for chick The Madagascan hoopoe usually occurs alone or in pairs, foraging on the ground, walking a few steps and then looking around, bobbing its head, probing the soil and leaf litter with its beak, picking items off the surface of the ground, probing dung and investigating crevices. Its diet consists mainly of insects such as beetles and flies and their larvae, grasshoppers and caterpillars. When disturbed it may fly to a horizontal branch where it perches, flashing its wings and raising and lowering its crest. This species is monogamous and territorial. Breeding takes place between August and December, mostly during October and November. The nest is in a deep cavity in a tree, often within of the ground. Little nesting material is used and the hole becomes messy and smelly before the young fledge. One nest had a clutch of six bluish-grey eggs. Incubation may possibly be done solely by the female, and the partner has been observed feeding the incubating bird. In other species of hoopoe, the incubation period is 15 to 16 days and the fledging period 26 to 32 days. Both parents are involved in feeding the young.

Calls are rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship calls are made. These ground rollers feed primarily on invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, and worms, which they find by searching through deep leaf litter or by remaining still and watching attentively. The ground roller primarily runs through its habitat on its strong legs, as its wings are relatively weak. It is a monogamous species, and it defends a territory during the breeding season of October to February. It digs a tunnel in the sand, at the end of which is a wider chamber where it makes its nest out of leaves and earthy pellets. Two to four eggs are laid. After the chicks fledge, the birds continue living in family groups until at least February before dispersing more widely across the scrubland. This bird is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar. Taxonomy British banker and naturalist Walter Rothschild first described the long-tailed ground roller in 1895, giving it the scientific name Uratelornis chimaera; Rothschild published his description in Novitates Zoologicae, the periodical of his private museum. The adaptations required for the ancestral long-tailed ground roller to inhabit scrubland led Rothschild to create the monotypic genus Uratelornis for the species in his description. The genus name Uratelornis is derived from the Ancient Greek word oura \\"tail,\\" and atelornis in reference to another genus of ground roller. Atelornis comes from the Ancient Greek words ateles \\"indeterminate or incomplete,\\" and ornis \\"bird.\\" The specific name, chimaera, is a reference to the Ancient Greek mythological creature known as the chimera. The long-tailed ground roller is placed in the ground roller family, which gets its common name due to its similarity to the rollers and its largely terrestrial nature. Until recently the ground rollers, cuckoo roller, and rollers were all placed in a single family, Coraciidae, in which each of the three groups formed a subfamily. In 1971, Joel Cracraft proposed a separate family for the ground rollers based on significant differences in behavior, plumage, and post-cranial anatomy between the groups. This position is supported by DNA evidence. It has been suggested, but not widely accepted, that ground rollers are closely related to the puffbirds and jacamars. It has been speculated that the ancestor of the long-tailed ground roller was an arboreal roller that crossed over from Africa to Madagascar and developed a terrestrial lifestyle before moving from the rainforests into the long-tailed ground roller's arid scrubland. No fossils have been found for this genus, and genetic analysis suggests that this bird's closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller has no subspecies. Description The long-tailed ground roller is largely terrestrial. The long-tailed ground roller's silhouette is highly distinctive due to its long tail and plump silhouette. The bird is long, although its tail can contribute up to of the length, which makes it the longest tail of any of the ground rollers. This ground roller has short wings and long, pinkish-brown legs. The male has a sandy buff crown and dark brown upperparts with black streaks. Its supercilium is a pale buff color, while the ear-coverts are brown. The eyes are brown, while the short and stout beak is black. Its tongue is long with a brush-like tip to help it collect insects. A white stripe is present at the base of the bill and is surrounded by brown and black malar stripes. These malar stripes and the black breastband frame a white throat. The tail has 15 to 20 dark brown bars marking it, while the outer rectrices are sky blue; this sky blue is also present on the wing-coverts. In flight, the bird's two black and white bands on the primaries and secondaries are conspicuous. The underparts are a light gray, and the breast white. The toes are zygodactylous, with the first and fourth toes turned outwards and the middle two toes turned inwards. The female resembles the male, but is smaller and has a narrower chestband and a shorter tail. Also, the female loses her tail while nesting. These differences make the long-tailed ground roller the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism. Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female, but have duller plumage, particularly in the black bands on the chest, neck, and eyes. Although it is generally a silent species, during the breeding season the vocalizations of the long-tailed ground roller include a \\"hooting\\" sound, a \\"popping\\" tu-tuc, and a soft boo sound. The low-pitched \\"hooting\\" is given by males from a perch above the ground at dusk or at night. The sound carries for a distance of at least and may either attract a mate or defend a territory. The bird pumps its tail while giving this call. One territorial call is a series of soft boo notes, typically coming in sets of six to ten and descending in volume near the end. Another call, given by both sexes, is a series of chuckling tu-tuc sounds lasting between 10 and 40 seconds that occasionally ends in a loud snapping sound produced by the wings. This call is given when birds are close to each other either on the ground or on low perches, and it does not carry over long distances. The use of wing- snapping to produce a sound is a rare phenomenon in birds, and in the order Coraciiformes only one other family, the todies, is known to do it. Low gu notes are given by mates as they come in contact with each other. Distribution and habitat Spiny forest at Ifaty, featuring an Adansonia (baobab) species and other vegetation Endemic to the island nation of Madagascar, the long-tailed ground roller inhabits a narrow strip of suitable habitat by the coast in the southwestern part of the island. This strip is bordered by the Mangoky River in the north, the Fiherenana River in the south, and lowland hills in the east. It totals about in area; however, the species is extremely uncommon within its range and occurs at densities of about 0.8 to 10 per square kilometer (2.1 to 25 per square mile). This area ranges in elevation from sea level to . The long-tailed ground roller does not migrate, though it may disperse across a larger area outside the breeding season. This species' prime habitat is spiny forest, a mix of sub-arid thorn-scrub and deciduous woodland that only receives on average of water a year and is covered in sandy soil. The dominant plants in these spiny forests belong to the cactus-like family Didiereaceae (especially Didierea madagascariensis) and more tree-like family Euphorbiaceae (especially Euphorbia stenoclada). Baobab trees are also prevalent. It was formerly believed that the long-tailed ground roller preferred an undisturbed forest habitat, while tolerating small amounts of disturbance. Later studies have concluded that it actually prefers degraded habitat. Despite this, shade is necessary, and the species is not found in deforested habitat or on the shadeless dunes prevalent in its range. Ecology and behavior The long-tailed ground roller is a shy and elusive bird and, if seen by a human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, but it is a powerful runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited. Diet This species forages almost exclusively from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching for it by rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats a wide range of invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair. Reproduction Entrance to a nesting burrow The breeding season coincides with the rainy season, which lasts from October to January. During this period this bird abandons its solitary habits to find a mate, with which it remains monogamous. Males form territories during the breeding season, and they defend their area with territorial calls. These calls are given from a perch up to off the ground for an hour after sunrise and occasionally throughout the day and night. During courtship, males have been observed feeding the female. Male and female long- tailed ground rollers use their bills and feet to excavate a burrow in consolidated, flat sand and construct their nest at the end of it. The burrow, always constructed away from grassy vegetation, is downward-sloping and is between long with a diameter of . The end of the burrow widens into a wide chamber with a shallow depression covered in dry leaves and earthy pellets. When digging its nest, the long-tailed ground roller occasionally walks underneath a low branch, tilts its head upwards, and, while remaining motionless, releases a rising crescendo of its tu-tuc calls. At the height of the crescendo the bird breaks off its call and flies upwards onto the branch while producing a \\"ripping and crackling sound\\" with its wingbeats. From the perch the bird releases a stream of boo notes. This display is thought to be part of a courtship ritual. Each pair digs one to six nesting burrows during the breeding season; the extra burrows are known as speculative burrows. Between October and January, and peaking in November, the species normally lays two smooth, white eggs, though sometimes it lays three or four. The incubation period and fledging time of this ground roller is unknown. After the young fledge, they live in a family group of four to five birds until approximately February, at which point the family disperses. Conservation Classified as vulnerable by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction and a decline in the quality of the remaining habitat, the long-tailed ground roller is believed to be the most threatened species of ground roller. Thirty percent of its already small habitat area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of habitat. As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its habitat, and as a result its habitat has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This ground roller is capable of tolerating some habitat disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the beginning of the twentieth century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed ground roller is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds and declining. Relationship with humans As the long-tailed ground roller is remarkably silent and difficult to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers to be one of the world's most elusive birds.

Its name comes from the Royal Dutch Shell Company, and the smaller town of Mera, which is to the northwest.  Shell Oil base  Shell Mera was established in 1937 as a Shell Oil Company base. It originally consisted of little more than several basic shacks and a airstrip. It was operated as part of Shell's prospecting efforts in the region. The base was located near some Indian tribes that strongly opposed the exploitation of resources found in their ancestral territories. On a few occasions the Indians attacked Shell, resulting in the deaths of several employees. The oil company eventually considered the base too dangerous to maintain, and abandoned it in 1948. However, it is more likely that business prospects had more to do with the decision. It was during this time that the Middle East rose in prominence in the oil industry, since it was becoming much more productive. After spending 10 years prospecting in Ecuador, the oil company had not produced any oil from the region.  Missionary base  Sometime around 1949, Shell was reoccupied by Mission Aviation Fellowship. MAF recognized the importance of Shell due to its airstrip and road access to Quito. They used it as their main base of operations for mission work in Ecuador, and it was also the home base of MAF pilots Nate Saint and Johnny Keenan. In 1954 Saint, a former member of the U.S. Army, welcomed General James Doolittle to Shell. Doolittle was an Air Force (Army Air Forces) aviator who rose to fame during what became known as \\"Doolittle's Raid\\" over Tokyo in 1942. General Doolittle was visiting Ecuador for then-President Eisenhower on a fact-finding mission for the CIA. World-wide attention focused on Shell in January 1956 at the news of the disappearance of Saint and four other missionaries ‚Äì Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderian. They had been trying to reach the Huaorani tribe, and had been making aerial reconnaissance missions. When they landed in Huaorani territory they were killed by the natives, their bodies thrown into the Curaray River. Once again, Shell served as a base of operations, this time for the families of the victims and rescue workers. Two years later, in 1958, the Hospital Vozandes Del Oriente opened its doors as the first hospital in that region of Ecuador. The hospital was the dream of Nate Saint, who donated both land and time to work on its construction before his death in 1956. It served an estimated 65,000 people who lived on the eastern side of the Andes and in the jungle. In 1985 a new Hospital Vozandes was opened on the other side of the Motolo River, and the old hospital was converted to a guest house, lasting until 2007 when weather and termites forced it to be torn down. The new Hospital Vozandes Del Oriente was closed at the end of 2013, after 55 years of service in Pastaza. In August 1964, Nate Saint Memorial School opened in Shell for missionary children. The school was founded by Charlotte Dillon Swanson wife of Wallace Swanson, a missionary physician at the HCJB Hospital Voz Andes. She began by teaching her own children at home in 1962 and later expanded the school to include other missionary children. After she raised money for a building she named the school in memory of Nate Saint.  Today  Aerial view of Rio Amazonas Airport in Shell Mera. Today, Shell is a much larger town than it was, complete with a Spanish-speaking church, hangars, schools, hotels, and missionary guest houses. The Saints' house is also still standing. Hospital Basico del Oriente is being reopened by a team led by Dr. Eckehart Wolff and other physicians who are supporting this effort. The airstrip remains operational and continues to service the region as the Rio Amazonas Airport (PTZ), which is owned by the military and used as a base. The airport is also still a major base of operations for the MAF.  References  * . * . * . * . * Wishall, Garrett E.

He also served as a Member of the National Assembly (MNA) from 1976 to 1985. Biography He was born in Saint-Tite, a small town north of Trois-Rivi√®res and has always considered himself as a child of the Mauricie where his immigrant ancestors settled in the middle of the 19th century. They were among the first Europeans to settle as high as the M√©kinac river in the upper Saint-Maurice River area. His family moved to Trois-Rivi√®res in 1942 and his father signed him up in the Jardin de l'Enfance where he was taught by nuns from Brittany, in France, who were also related to the Vaugeois family. That choice would have a major influence on him, first because of the nuns concern for language and also because there was a children's library on the way to school. It was like a calling, books! He took his \\"cours classique\\" at the s√©minaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivi√®res and opted to study arts and education. Then he went on to the √âcole normale Jacques-Cartier and the Faculty of Arts of the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Two professors particularly influenced him, Jan de Groot and Maurice S√©guin. The former taught the importance of work, while the latter introduced him to history. Denis Vaugeois in 2012 He began teaching history in several institutions while pursuing his education towards a degree in arts, a degree in education, and doctoral studies in history. In 1963 he participated to the creation of Boreal Express with Jacques Lacourci√®re and the librarian and student Pierre Gravel, at that time participating to the creation of the Comite international pour l'ind√©pendance du Qu√©bec. He also started to get in touch with a famous engineer, closely linked with politicians Gordon Boisseau. In 1965, he became the first head of studies in history of Quebec's newly created Education Ministry. Extremely disappointed by the orientation of education reform, which the people rejected by sending the Liberal Party back into the opposition in the 1966 elections, he turned towards international activities. After being co-director of the Centre franco-qu√©b√©cois de d√©veloppement p√©dagogique (the France-Quebec education development centre), he became executive director of Quebec's international relations and, in that capacity, worked on developing the network of Quebec delegations and houses abroad. In 1976, he was elected Member of the National Assembly for Trois- Rivi√®res and became a member of Ren√©-L√©vesque's Cabinet in 1978. Appointed Minister of Cultural Affairs, he devoted much effort to the defense of Quebec's heritage and the development of its network of libraries and museums. He also took on responsibility for the Ministry of Communications during the 1980 referendum and he denounced what he claimed was illegal spending done by the Liberal Party led by Pierre Trudeau. Following a disagreement with Premier L√©vesque concerning development of the Quebec territory, he left the cabinet in 1981 and then left politics in 1985. He went back to publishing. Feeling some nostalgia for the years devoted to Les √©ditions du Bor√©al, which he had founded with others in 1962, he decided to found Les √©ditions du Septentrion. As in the past, he combines management with research. The Atlantic world interests him, and more specifically, the history of the French in the Americas and their meeting with the first inhabitants and the constant and multi-formed exchange with immigrants from throughout the world. His work, both books and radio and television, bear witness to the progress of what he has qualified as the \\"Quebec melting pot\\".

Characteristics This species expresses very little sexual dimorphism, with both males and females being the same deep shade of blue with red head crowns and flight feathers. Females can have slightly more yellow-green beaks while males always have a bright yellow, with both having a forehead shield that flares to a medium orange. Their wings are round and short, best for short bursts of powered flight. They have black legs with three forward facing toes; with a fourth toe being semi-zygodactylous, which makes them nimble canopy dwellers. Size can vary from 15 to 18 inches and weigh just under one pound. They are considered very sturdy birds that can live anywhere from 8 to 20 years. Sources on life spans tend to vary. left Habitat This bird is mostly found in woodlands, open forest and riparian habitats in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. They generally avoid heavily forested areas and their numbers remain strong despite the threat of habitat destruction due to agriculture expansion. These birds are non- migrating and rarely travel far from their birthplace, but will travel if food is not abundant in their immediate area. Diet These birds are largely frugivorous, consuming mostly the fruits, flowers, and seeds of both wild and cultivated plants. They are known for being one of the biggest seed spreaders in the region. They will also eat small insects like termites and snails; especially around brooding season. Their genus name (Musophagidae) actually means ‚Äúplantain eater‚Äù which is a misnomer, because they rarely gravitate to banana or plantain trees. They actually prefer figs over most things. Due to their opportunistic feeding style, they are considered pests in most areas because they can easily destroy crops and gardens. Reproduction A pair in an oceanarium in Budapest. Ross's turaco form monogamous breeding pairs that share incubation and feeding duties. They lay 2 to 3 eggs which hatch after roughly 25 days. They then spend another 4 to 7 weeks nesting with their parents before they fledge. Strangely, they become mostly independent before they can fly, opting to climb about in the canopy of the forest. They reach sexual maturity after one year of age and remain near their parents in extended family flocks of up to thirty individuals. Flock members often assist in raising other flock members chicks, especially when the female is a first time mother. These birds are known to become more territorial around brooding season, especially with predatory or unfamiliar birds. Captivity It is quite common in captivity, although not as common as its nearest relative the violet turaco. Zoo diets often consist of \\"oranges, apples, mangoes, pears, papayas, bananas, and soft bill diet pellets.\\" These birds do quite well in captivity as they prefer to climb over flight, and breed quite readily with extended lives compared to their wild counterparts. They are kept as pets, but are largely found in zoos and botanical gardens due to their colors and easy nature.

It is endemic to Cameroon. In French it is known as touraco de Bannerman or touraco dor√©. Its scientific and common names honour the ornithologist David Armitage Bannerman. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat destruction and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as an \\"endangered species\\". Taxonomy The Bannerman's turaco was first described in 1923 by the American naturalist George Latimer Bates. Genetic studies show that this species is closely related to the red-crested turaco (Tauraco erthrolophus) and white-crested turaco (Tauraco leucolophus), having diverged from them in the late Pliocene. At that time, climatic changes occurred which subsequently led to increasingly arid conditions, a decrease in forest cover and an increase in wooded savannah. The white-crested turaco maintained a widespread distribution, perhaps by adapting to new habitats, while Bannerman's turaco became restricted to montane habitats where the forest cover remained. Description Bannerman's turaco grows to a length of . It has a grey head, orange-red crown, crest and nape, dark green upper parts, paler green underparts and a blue tail. Red under-wing patches are visible in flight, but it is a shy bird and seldom seen. Its voice is distinctive however, being a raucous series of \\"kow-kow-kow\\" notes that can be heard a kilometre away. Distribution Bannerman's turaco is endemic to forested mountains in Cameroon. Its main population is in the Bamenda Highlands in western Cameroon, with some birds being present in the Massif du Mbam. It has also been recorded from forested remnants in the Bamenda Highlands in the Western High Plateau. It inhabits montane forest, either primary forests or secondary forests where plenty of tall trees are allowed to remain, supplying the fruits it needs. Its altitudinal range is between . Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that there are between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals scattered among fragmented populations and that the number of birds is decreasing. The chief cause of the declining population is habitat loss, mostly from wildfires, but also from land clearance for agriculture and grazing, and from timber extraction and the collection of firewood. It tends not to survive in forest fragments, being reluctant to cross cleared areas. The birds are also hunted for their feathers which are used in ceremonies by the local villagers. For all these reasons, the IUCN has assessed their conservation status as being \\"endangered\\". References External links *BirdLife Species Factsheet.

Viviane is known as the queen or reine of Senegalese music. On March 31, 2012 the label Wonda Music of producer Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis signed her to his recording label. Since then, Viviane has been working with Jerry Wonda and her album was released in 2015. Family and background Ndour was born in Mbour, Senegal, one of the coastal cities near the Atlantic Ocean. Her father is from Lebanon and her mother is from Mauritania. Her grandmother from her mother's side is from Mali. Her ethnic mix plays a big role in her music. Her music combines traditional Senegalese mbalax music with elements of U.S. rap, R&B; and Country music. She released her first album in 1999 and formed a group called Le Jolof Band in 2001. Most of her songs are in either Wolof or English though a few are in French, the official language of Senegal. She was born Christian, but now she converted to Islam. Albums and videos As of 2009, Viviane currently had two albums actively selling on the market, in grocery stores and even in the shop in Senegal's airport. Those two albums were Bataclan Cafe (the most recent) and Man Diarra, which arrived in 2005. Bataclan Cafe contains work recorded live in concert and her hit \\"Beggue Na Lenn\\" (meaning \\"love you all\\" in English) which she has a video for; receiving regular spins on Senegalese television in 2007. The hit single off the 2005 Man Diara album was \\"Kagna La Giss\\". In the song she sings vibrantly about missing her loved one, and dreaming and wishing of his return. Like many Wolof songs, and as tradition in music of the region, the song builds and builds to a climax and the final verse captures her giving shout-outs to various people. In 2010 she gained her first taste of international notoriety by doing a commercial for the Ritz cracker company where she can be heard singing her song \\"Ta Ta Viviane!\\" Viviane signed to Wonda Music on March 31, 2012. She has been working with Grammy award-winning producer Jerry Wonda at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City. Other popular songs and videos Other hit videos of her are tracks such as \\"Welcome to Africa\\" with Mokobe, and possibly her greatest achievement, \\"Cheri Boy\\" in which we find Viviane effortlessly blending hip-hop, R&B;, Reggae, and traditional Senegalese sound all in one track. The beat of the song has a soft, smooth reggae feel, the chorus is sung R&B; style, and the verses are 16 bar raps like American style hip-hop. Relationship to American music A story that briefly details Ndour's relationship with American music is relayed by Likembe on his blog: \\"It's said that the first time Viviane heard Aaliyah's \\"Are You That Somebody\\" she thought it was Americans copying Senegalese music. Her remake, \\"Goor Fit,\\" featured on Entre Nous/Between Us/Ci Sunu Biir, proved to be one of her most memorable and popular songs, so naturally there had to be still another version, \\"Am Fit,\\" from 2003's Fii Ak Fee (Jololi). I've always liked Aaliyah's original, but Viviane's versions take the song to transcendent new levels.\\" Live shows While some of her songs may borrow American styles, Viviane Ndour still stays true to her roots as a Senegalese artist. In her live shows, the songs do not follow the usual 3- to 5-minute formats of American songs. She usually has a live band, and the drum work is provided in traditional fashion as a dancer will make movements responding naturally to whatever changes in rhythm the drummer may decide to make. Unscripted, whenever Ndour decides, she will again return to the song, but much of it is separated with interaction/ad libs with the audience.http://musiques- afrique.com/icons/viviane_ndour_small.jpg Accolades Awards * 2002 Kora Awards- Nominated * 2011 AFROTAINMENT MUSEKE AFRICA MUSIC AWARDS- Winner * 2012 Cameroon Entertainment Awards- Winner * 2012 Nigerian Entertainment Awards- Winner * 2012 Kora Awards- Nominated * 2013 PORO AWARDS 2013 Abidjan World Music Festival- Winner * 2016 WatsUp TV Africa Music Video Awards - Winner (Best African Female Video) Nominations * 2014 African Muzik Magazine Awards (Best Female West Africa) - (Nominated) Albums *Entre Nous/Between us/Ci sunu biir: 1999 *Nature: 2000 *Le Show: 2001 *Tere Nelaw: 2002 *Fii ak Fee: 2003 *Viviane et Freres: 2004 *Man Diarra: 2005 *Bataclan Cafe: 2007 *Wuyayooy: 2010 *Retanne: 2014 *Wuyuma: 2016 * Benen Level: 2020 References External links * http://www.moamas.com/ * http://www.cameroonentertainmentawards.org/Winners2012-Music.aspx#nominees * http://www.jaguda.com/2012/09/03/nigeria-entertainment-awards-2012-all-the- winners/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20121107235347/http://www.koraawards.org/container/_nom.php?categor=2 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Senegalese female singers Category:Senegalese people of Lebanese descent Category:Senegalese people of Mauritanian descent Category:Senegalese people of Malian descent Category:People from M'Bour ","title":"Viviane Ndour"},{"id":"12432281","text":"The British Museum Act 1816 (56 Geo 3 c 99) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . (2011). This species is the most commonly raised turaco in captive conditions. Distribution and habitat The white-cheeked turaco is native to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it is found in Podocarpus and juniper forests in the highland regions. Subspecies There are two subspecies, the nominate subspecies T. l. leucotis found in the Podocarpus forests of Eritrea, Ethiopia and southeastern South Sudan and T. l. donaldsoni found in south-central Ethiopia south of the Rift Valley and in the extreme west of Somalia. The latter is quite distinct in plumage colour - the eastern population is separated from the larger population by the escarpment. The white-crested turaco has been shown to hybridise with the sympatric Prince Ruspoli's turaco (Tauraco ruspolii) that contributed more to concerns about Ruspoli's turaco that is considered endangered. In captivity In captivity a 'cinnamon' colour sport (a recessive colour mutation) first occurred spontaneously in birds bred by Mr D Jones in Gloucestershire, England and is now present in captive birds in other countries. A single white-cheeked turaco has been living wild in east London (Leytonstone and South Woodford). The sighting was recorded and confirmed in October 2009. It has survived the climate and potential predators for at least seven years and appears to be living in harmony with native species. It's believed to be an escaped or released pet. Sightings in gardens have continued to delight Londoners. In 2014 another bird (or the same one who fancied a change of scenery perhaps?) was sighted in Langton Green, Kent and has caused much interest to the residents, being featured in the village magazine.\\"Langton Life November 2014 Sightings in east London have continued into 2017 with the turaco seen in January enjoying scraps under bird feeders in residential gardens near Wanstead Park and in July flying around the treetops in Bushwood.

Gardiner was a Victorian-era photographer. He is best known for his work on Mackinac Island, Michigan.  Life  In Canada Born in 1861 in Brampton, Ontario, little is known of Gardiner's early life. His father, William Clarke Gardiner, was a hotel keeper. The family lived in the small town of Avening north of Orangeville, Ontario from 1866 until about 1874, when they moved to Toronto. What led Gardiner into photography is not known, but he chose it as a career from an early age. When he was only twenty the Toronto directory listed him as a photographer, boarding with his parents. In 1883 he married Louise East. They had two children, H. (Harry) MarshallCoffin, C. 'Interview with family of H. Marshall Gardiner': \\"The H. was for Harry\\", Roggeveen D. (2018) and Ethel. In the early 1880s Gardiner worked for prominent and respected Toronto photographers, first Thomas E. Perkins and then Samuel J. Dixon. In the latter 1880s Gardiner moved to Orangeville, sixty miles northwest of Toronto. He opened his own photographic business for a time before joining the William Still Studio. By 1888 he had returned to Toronto and opened a studio. Times were apparently not good and by 1890 Gardiner is no longer listed in the city directory as a photographer, but as a \\"fruitier\\" with his wife Louise. They soon emigrated to the United States.Lisa Dziabis Calache, \\"William Henry Gardiner (1861-1935); An Early Canadian/American Photographer,\\" Photographic Canadiana (September ‚Äì October 1998): 8-13. Move to the United States The Gardiners established themselves in Detroit, where William once again took up photography. The city directory lists several business locations from 1891 through 1896. Like many photographers, he produced portraits as well as commercial work. Several views of downtown Detroit and Belle Isle Park survive in his negative collection. There are also a number of photos of buildings at Grace Hospital, one photo of the State Capitol at Lansing and a group of photos of an unidentified \\"hobby\\" farm, likely in southwest Michigan. These Detroit views document that he was doing more than portraits, and are very likely only a portion of his work there. One of Gardiner's photos, of the Detroit Health Department, appears in the 1901 City of Detroit Annual Report. At some point after his arrival in Michigan, Gardiner visited Mackinac Island; the exact date is not known. His earliest Mackinac images date to 1896, the year he opened his gallery in the studio formerly occupied by the Foley Brothers in the Marquette Building at corner of Fort and Main Streets. The Petoskey Daily Resorter announced he was \\"prepared to do all work and in the latest styles.\\" Within a few years he moved down the street to the second floor of Fenton's Bazaar, where he would remain for the remainder of his career. Gardiner was drawn to the resort life, for at about the same time he came to Mackinac Island he began spending his winters in Daytona, Florida. He may have been plying his trade there as early as 1894. In 1901 he and Louise opened \\"Gardiner's Gift and Art Shop\\" in downtown Daytona. Gardiner ran his studio in the back of the building, while Louise operated the store at the front. Thus, at the turn of the twentieth century the course of Gardiner's life was set, with a summer studio on Mackinac Island and a winter one in Daytona. Daytona appears to have been his place of primary residence after 1905 (he remained in the Detroit residential listings until 1905), where he was active in civic affairs. He eventually purchased the building he was renting along with adjacent property to construct the Gardiner Building, a retail and office block. Along with his son Marshall, he was involved in other real estate ventures including purchasing the Colony House (Palmetto) Hotel. The hotel burned in 1922 and the Gardiners replaced it with apartments and two residences, one for himself and Louise and the other for H. Marshall and his family. H. Marshall Gardiner the son of William H. Gardiner, was also a photographer and began work in Bermuda in the early twentieth century and in 1910 established a summer shop in Nantucket, MassachusettsCoffin, C. 'Interview with family of H. Marshall Gardiner'Roggeveen D. (2018). A true distinction of Gardiner's work, and the one that would become his legacy, was the production of hand-tinted views. All Mackinac photographers offered prints of scenic island locations. Gardiner offered regular black and white prints, framed or unframed. His colored views, each hand tinted, were a cut above the rest. Hand-tinted scenic views were popularized in the United States by Wallace Nutting. A New England Congregational minister, Nutting was forced into retirement while only forty- three due to ill health. He developed a deep interest in early American architecture and decorative arts and became a pioneer of the Colonial Revival and preservation movements. Nutting published extensively on early American furniture and began to produce reproductions of the same. He also took an interest in photography, focusing on early American themes. Nutting's hand- colored images of New England, Florida and Ireland often highlighted their archaic historical charm. They were very popular, and Nutting is known as the father of early twentieth-century hand colored photos. Numerous photographers across the country emulated the Nutting style, producing views of picturesque locals. Gardiner likely began producing his hand-colored photographs of Mackinac Island and Florida in the early twentieth century. The compositions closely resemble Nutting's. Each was inscribed with the title and Gardiner's signature \\"W. H. Gardiner\\" in pencil at the bottom. H. Marshall Gardiner would produce the same type of images in Florida, Bermuda and Nantucket. Gardiner also continued to market un-tinted images, both framed and unframed. Gardiner continued operating his studio and shop throughout World War I, the Roaring Twenties and into the Great Depression. He likely switched from glass plates to film negatives around 1915. None of these have survived. On October 22, 1935, on his annual autumn journey from Mackinac to Daytona, William H. Gardiner died of a heart attack. The studio and shop on the second floor of the Fenton Building on Mackinac Island remained property of the family until Louise and Marshall Gardiner's deaths in 1942, within days of each other. The contents of the studio were abandoned where they remained in an unused portion of the second floor for the next quarter century.Steven C.

This bird's common name and Latin binomial commemorate the German banker and amateur ornithologist Hermann Schalow. upright Characteristic These birds are light for a turaco species; weighing just over half a pound (270g), with a length of 15 to 17 inches. Their colour is a coppery-jade green that fades to a dark iridescent blue the closer you get towards the tail. They have long white tripped crests with small red beaks and red skin around their dark eyes lined with white feathers. Mature birds have, on average, the longest crests of any turaco species. Their wings are short and round with red flight feathers meant for short flights. Habitat It is distributed mainly in Zambia, central Angola, the southern DRC, and the uplands of southern Kenya, northern and western Tanzania and western Malawi. It occurs very locally in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, where it frequents riparian habitats of the Zambezi and Cuando Rivers. It occurs in the forested uplands and wooded inland plateaus of south central Africa. It is replaced in the eastern lowlands by Livingstone's turaco, which is comparable in appearance and behavior. Diet Schalows consume mainly fruit and other plant matter, while eating a more insect-based diet as chicks. They will generally feed in large flocks and are social outside of nesting. Reproduction These birds are territorial of their nesting site. Solitary monogamous pairs will nest and care for their offspring; sharing incubation duties that last for 20 to 22 days. Their clutch generally only consists of two eggs, laid in a platform nest built high in the forest canopy. Within 2 to 3 weeks, the chicks are strong enough to climb outside of the nest, and will start flying after another 1 to 2 weeks.

It was considered to be the same species as the greater yellow- headed vulture until they were split in 1964. It is found in Mexico, Central America, and South America in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. It is a large bird, with a wingspan of . The body plumage is black, and the head and neck, which are featherless, are pale orange with red or blue areas. It lacks a syrinx, so therefore its vocalizations are limited to grunts or low hisses. The lesser yellow-headed vulture feeds on carrion and locates carcasses by sight and by smell, an ability which is rare in birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses as its bill is not strong enough to do this. Like other New World vultures, the lesser yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation. Taxonomy The lesser yellow-headed vulture was first described in 1845 by John Cassin. It is sometimes recognized as having two subspecies. The first, Cathartes burrovianus urubitinga, described by Austrian ornithologist August von Pelzeln in 1851, is the larger of the two and is found from Argentina north to Colombia, while the nominate subspecies, Cathartes burrovianus burrovianus, is smaller and found from northwestern South America through Central America to Mexico. The lesser yellow-headed vulture's genus, Cathartes, means \\"purifier\\" and is from the Latinized form of the Greek kathartƒìs/Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅœÑŒ∑œÇ. The common name, vulture, is derived from the Latin word vulturus, which means \\"tearer\\" and is a reference to its feeding habits. The exact taxonomic placement of the lesser yellow-headed vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks.Sibley, Charles G. and Burt L.

Description Lesser yellow-headed vulture at the Natura Artis Magistra The lesser yellow-headed vulture is in length, with a wingspan of and a tail length of . Its weight ranges from . Its plumage is black with a green sheen. The throat and the sides of the head are featherless. The head and neck are bare of feathers, and the skin is yellow, with a reddish forehead and nape and a gray-blue crown. The irises of its eyes are red, its legs are white, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. The tail is rounded and relatively short for a vulture; the tip of the closed wing extends beyond the tail. Immature lesser yellow-headed vultures have browner plumage, a dusky head, and a white nape. The beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. The front toes are long with small webs at their bases and are not adapted to grasping. The opening of the nostril is longitudinal, and the nostrils lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the lesser yellow-headed vulture lacks a syrinx, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than a low hiss. It differs in appearance from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow- headed vulture and has a shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed vulture. Its flight is also less steady than that of the greater yellow-headed vulture. The lesser yellow-headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed vulture. Besides the greater yellow-headed vulture, it is similar to the turkey vulture. Distribution and habitat It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, mangroves, and heavily degraded former forest. It may wander over dry fields and clearings. It is not generally found in high-altitude regions. This bird with its somehow crow-like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell together with the black vulture and the turkey vulture.Quebrada de los Cuervos Ecology and behavior In the Pantanal, Brazil The lesser yellow-headed vulture flies solitarily, with wings held in a dihedral position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The lesser yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation. Breeding At Tennoji Zoo in Osaka Lesser yellow-headed vultures do not build nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, or in the hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial‚Äîthey are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. The young fledge after two to three months. Feeding The lesser yellow-headed vulture is a scavenger and subsists almost entirely on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat is in a state of extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The lesser yellow-headed vulture forages using its keen eyesight to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain responsible for processing smells is particularly large compared to other animals. This characteristic of New World vultures has been used by humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the foraging vultures. King vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the lesser yellow- headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller lesser yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size. Conservation The lesser yellow-headed vulture is a bird of Least Concern according to the IUCN, with an estimated global range of and a population of between 100,000 and 1,000,000 individuals.BirdLife International (2007) Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture Cathartes burrovianus Its population trend appears to be stable.

The throat and the sides of the head are featherless. The skin on the head ranges in color from deep yellow to pale orange with a blue crown. The nape and the area near the nostrils are pale pinkish. The undersides of the wings are black, while the flight feathers are a lighter shade. The quills of the eleven primary feathers appear to be white when seen from above. The tail is rounded and long for a vulture, extending to or slightly beyond the tip of the closed wing. The sexes are outwardly similar. The head is dull greyish in juveniles, which otherwise resemble adults. The irises of its eyes are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid. The front toes are long with small webs at their bases and are not adapted to grasping.

Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike the other members of the genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.The Birds of Ecuador by Robert S.

Distribution and habitat The greater yellow-headed vulture is found in the Amazon Basin of tropical South America; specifically in south-eastern Colombia, southern and eastern Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, northern and western Brazil, northern Bolivia, eastern Peru and eastern Ecuador. It is not found in the Andes, in the lowlands west or north of the Andes, in the relatively open regions of northern South America, eastern South America, or in the southern subtropical regions. It has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests. It is not generally found in high-altitude regions. It is common in heavily forested regions. It may wander over grasslands, but rarely strays far from forested areas, which provide shelter and nesting areas. Ecology and behavior The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed dead trees to observe surrounding terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, in what is called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow- headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.

The Act gave effect to an earlier contract between Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, and the Government of the Kingdom of Great Britain, represented by HM Treasury, to sell the Atholls' feudal rights over the Island to Great Britain for a sum of ¬£70,000. The authority to conclude a contract for the purchase was given under a private Act of Parliament in 1726, but as an Act of Parliament of 1609 had conferred the feudal rights over the island upon the Atholls, primary legislation was required to terminate those rights. The Act came into force upon the granting of Royal Assent on 10 May 1765. The payment to the Duchess of Atholl was to be made no later than 1 June 1765. The Act did not go as far as had been proposed: for a period there had been plans to merge the Isle of Man into the English county of Cumberland. This had met with fierce resistance from the inhabitants, led by the then Speaker of the House of Keys, Sir George Moore.The Isle of Man: Celebrating a Sense of Place, Vaughan Robinson, Danny McCarroll, Liverpool University Press, 1990, page 126 The long title of the Act was \\"An Act for carrying into Execution a Contract, made pursuant to the Act of Parliament of the 12th of his late Majesty King George 1st, between the Commissioners of his Majesty‚Äôs Treasury and the Duke and Duchess of Atholl, the proprietors of the Isle of Man, and their Trustees, for the purchase of the said Island and its dependencies, under certain exceptions therein particularly mentioned.\\" Having taken effect and therefore being effectively \\"spent\\", the Act was finally repealed by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1976. Subsequent rights sold Under the Isle of Man Purchase Act, the Atholls still retained their manorial rights, the patronage of the bishopric, and certain other perquisites. These were sold in 1828 for the sum of ¬£417,144 (over ¬£20,000,000 in modern terms). This was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament: * \\"An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man\\" [c. 34] 10 June 1824 * \\"An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty‚Äôs Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl\\" [c. 34] 10 June 1825 See also *History of the Isle of Man ‚Äì Revestment References Category:Government of the Isle of Man Category:Manx law Category:Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1765 Category:Repealed Great Britain Acts of Parliament ","title":"Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765"},{"id":"12432546","text":"Maritime interdiction (or naval interdiction) operations (MIOs) are naval operations, that aim to delay, disrupt, or destroy enemy forces or supplies en route to the battle area before they do any harm against friendly forces, similar to air interdiction.

The operations involved the stopping and boarding of any and all ships transiting the Persian Gulf, and the Strait of Hormuz, to search for oil, weapons, and certain fugitives from justice.

It tells the story of a girl from Nepal named Lakshmi, who is sold into sexual slavery in India. The novel is written in a series of short, vignette-style chapters, from the point of view of the main character. The 2014 movie Sold by Oscar-winning director Jeffrey D. Brown is based on the same novel. Plot Lakshmi is a thirteen-year-old girl living with her family in a small hut in the mountains of Nepal. Her family is desperately poor, but her life is full of simple pleasures, like raising her black-and-white speckled goat, and having her mother brush her hair by the light of an oil lamp. But now the harsh Himalayan monsoons wash away all that remains of the family's crops, Lakshmi's stepfather says she must leave home and take a job to support her family. He introduces her to a charming stranger who tells her she will find her a job as a maid working for a wealthy woman in the city. Glad to be able to help, Lakshmi undertakes the long journey to India and arrives at ‚ÄúHappiness House‚Äù full of hope. But she soon learns the horrible truth: she has been sold into prostitution. An old woman named Mumtaz rules the brothel with cruelty and cunning. She tells Lakshmi that she is trapped there until she can pay off her family's debt ‚Äì then cheats Lakshmi of her meager earnings so that she can never leave. Lakshmi's life becomes a nightmare from which she cannot escape. Still, she lives by her mother's words ‚Äì ‚ÄúSimply to endure is to triumph‚Äù ‚Äì and gradually, she forms friendships with the other girls that enable her to survive in this terrifying new life. She also teaches herself to read and speak in English through listening to the conversations of people around her and books she manages to take. Eventually, Lakshmi meets an American man, who arrives and disguises himself as a client to gather the evidence he needs to prosecute Mumtaz and her associates. Mumtaz is ultimately arrested, thus freeing Lakshmi and the other girls. Characters *Lakshmi, a thirteen-year- old farm girl in danger, the narrator and protagonist of the novel. When the monsoons come and her family's crops are destroyed, she is sold into sex slavery by her stepfather. *Ama, Lakshmi's mother; she is described as a typical village wife. She bears her family's struggles by being the only working adult in their household, but she still manages to be beautiful, at least in her daughter's eyes: ‚ÄúMy ama, with her crow-black hair braided...her dark brown skin, and her ears hung with the joyful noise of tinkling gold, to me, is more lovely.‚ÄùMcCormick, p. 7 *Stepfather, a lazy gambler, and Ama's second husband. He spends his days at the tea shop gambling and conversing with the old men and sees no value in Lakshmi. Stepfather is always willing to spend the family's earnings on unnecessary selfish items for himself. *Gita: Lakshmi's best friend. She went to the city to work for a rich family and send money back to her own. *Tali: Lakshmi's goat. She gives the milk Lakshmi makes cheese with. She follows Lakshmi around a lot as if it were her child and acts as the young girl's best friend *Bajai Sita, described as the first who bought Lakshmi. *Auntie Bimla, described as a modern woman by Lakshmi, whom she takes on a long journey into the city where the naive farm girl thinks she is going to work as a maid. *Uncle Husband, described as a ‚Äúslapping man‚Äù, takes Lakshmi across the border to the place where she is to work. While on their journey, he orders her to call him husband, probably because he didn't want to attract any negative attention towards them. After he drops Lakshmi off at her destination, the Happiness House, she never sees him again. *Mumtaz, the owner of the Happiness House, she is portrayed as a cruel and selfish woman. She oversees all the girls and ‚Äúmanages‚Äù their debts. Mumtaz is known for her ruthless punishments such as locking girls up for weeks, beating and starving them, as well as punishing any girls who try to escape or receive gifts from customers by dipping a stick in a mixture of chili peppers and shoving it up the offending girl's vagina. She instills fear in every inhabitant of the Happiness House. *Shahanna, Lakshmi's first friend at the Happiness House, a girl with ‚Äúteardrop eyes and deep brown skin, like the hide of a nut‚Äù.McCormick, p. 98 Shahanna is from Lakshmi's country and helps her get accustomed to her new life. In the novel they become best friends, sticking together to survive Mumtaz's wrath. Shahanna is taken away when the police raid the Happiness House because Mumtaz was late on her bribes to them. *Pushpa, a ‚Äúcoughing woman‚Äù, she is one of Lakshmi's roommates in the novel. Pushpa came to work for Mumtaz when her husband died. She has a baby girl and an eight-year-old son. Her illness gets her and her children kicked out of the house by Mumtaz who feels Pushpa is a waste of her money. *Shilpa, the ‚ÄúAging Bird Girl‚Äù, is Mumtaz's spy. Her character is described as having ‚Äúthe reed- thin body of a girl and the hollow cheeks of an old woman. She is, under the folds of her yellow dress, frail as a baby bird.‚ÄùMcCormick, p. 92 Shilpa is at the Happiness House at her own volition. Shilpa is also an alcoholic. *Anita, The ‚Äúhalf frowning girl‚Äù, is one of Lakshmi's roommates. In the novel, Anita is also from Lakshmi's and Shahanna's country. Once she ran away but the goonda (men who work for Mumtaz) caught her, beat her, and returned her to the Happiness House. They are the reason her face is lopsided. It's hard to read Anita sometimes because of her aloof manner, but she and Lakshmi become friends towards the end of the novel. *Harish, The David Beckham boy, is Pushpa's eight-year-old son. He is obsessed with David Beckham and soccer. He goes to school everyday and comes home to the Happiness House. In the novel Lakshmi is envious of Harish because he gets to live a semi-normal life and she doesn't. After he catches her looking at his book, Harish offers to teach Lakshmi English and Hindi. Harish runs errands for the girls and their customers at night. Sometimes he earns a few rupees. He is ‚Äúa boy of about eight [...]. He has hair that sticks up like the tassels on a cornstalk and knees as knobby as a baby goat's.‚ÄùMcCormick, p. 140 *Street Boy, a tea vendor. He comes to the Happiness House everyday to sell tea to the girls. He flirts with them but doesn't sleep with them. At first, Lakshmi is ashamed to be seen in the Happiness House by him, but when he starts giving her gifts of food, they form a bond. Unfortunately, he is given a new route, and they never see each other again. Lakshmi never learns this character's name. *Monica, one of the highest earning characters in the Happiness house, has almost paid off her debt. She also has a very short temper. She has a daughter at her home who she's paying school fees for. Monica says the people will thank and honor her and Lakshmi when they get home for sending money. When Monica returns home, she is not greeted with honor, but run out of her own village and comes back to the Happiness House. After a while, she is thrown out because she caught the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù. *American Customer #1: He pays for Lakshmi but does not sleep with her. Instead, he talks to her and tries to see if she wants to leave Happiness House. Lakshmi remains quiet during the exchange. He gives her a card. *American Customer #2: He is not a good American nor is interested in trying to rescue Lakshmi from Happiness House. He arrives drunk and sleeps with Lakshmi. *American Customer #3: Comes and asks Lakshmi questions. He takes a photograph of Lakshmi. The girl actually converses with him, somewhat. He says he will come back for Lakshmi, and he does. She leaves with him. *Habib: Lakshmi's first \\"customer\\". Reception Sold received positive reviews for exposing readers to an unfamiliar world. Kirkus reviews, for instance, commented that ‚ÄúMcCormick provides readers who live in safety and under protection of the law with a vivid window into a harsh and cruel world.‚Äù Booklist agreed, saying Sold is ‚Äú[a]n unforgettable account of sexual slavery as it exists now.‚Äù Awards and honors *ALA Top 10 Best Book for Young Adults 2007 *National Book Award Finalist 2007 *National Public Radio - Top 100 Books of the Year 2007 *Book Sense Pick 2007 *California Young Reader Medal 2007 *Quill Award 2007 *Gustav-Heinemann-Peace Prize 2008 *Elliot Rosewater Award 2009-2010 References Bibliography McCormick, Patricia.

Admission into the college is competitive, and students must achieve a 2.7 grade point average in the COB prerequisite courses to be considered for admission. These classes are taken throughout the student's career culminating in a course called COB 300, which is a 12-credit integrated class where the student connects the fundamentals of business in four functional areas: management, marketing, operations, and finance. Students are separated into groups for the task of creating a business plan for a business they create. The grade on the business plan factors into the student's final grades in all four COB 300 courses. The program prides itself on having a \\"no entitlement mentality\\" that provides students with \\"a dose of a practical business environment.\\"  Accounting  The School of Accounting is an academic unit of the College of Business.

It is especially known for its broad-based orientation and high level of education attained by its graduates. The program offers students a thorough grounding in business, foreign culture and language.  Management  The management program offers a curriculum leading to the BBA degree with a major in management. Management majors are exposed to information, exercises, cases, and assignments designed to enhance leadership skills, critical thinking, and analytical decision-making abilities. Students gain a basic understanding of how to apply key managerial concepts and theories in the contemporary work environment, how to integrate the functional areas of an organization and understand and appreciate human resource policies and procedures used by organizations and managers. JMU's management curriculum focuses on technical skills, the ability to work well with people, and the ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Depending on the concentration, the major in management prepares graduates for entry‚Äëlevel jobs in large, medium and small profit and non‚Äëprofit organizations, as well as government. The management major prepares graduates for jobs in industries such as manufacturing, consulting, retail, banking, public utilities, personal services, pharmaceutical products, consumer products, restaurants and insurance, as well as small and family businesses.  Marketing  The marketing program prepares students for rewarding careers by developing specialized skills in the management of customer relationships through the creation, communication, and delivery of value to customers. Marketing students develop in-depth knowledge on identifying, attracting, evaluating and retaining customers. They evaluate marketing alternatives and commit to a course of action, using financial, organizational, environmental, and ethical criteria to guide decision-making. The innovative marketing curriculum requires students to use information technology tools for customer research and in the evaluation of strategic performance. All majors will declare a concentration in either Business-to-Business or Business-to-Consumer marketing.

Chartier works in reductionist microsound electronic music, a form of extreme minimalism in which the music is sometimes very quiet, sometimes very sparse, often both. About Since 1998, Chartier has created recordings for labels such as LINE (USA), Raster- Noton (Germany), Die Stadt (Germany), Spekk (Japan), 12k (US) Mutek rec (Canada), DSP (Italy), and ERS (NL), Trente Oiseaux (Germany), and Fallt (Ireland), Intransitive (USA), including collaborations with artists Taylor Deupree, William Basinski, CoH, *0, Kim Cascone, and Asmus Tietchens and has appeared on numerous international electronic music and sound art compilations. Chartier's minimalist digital work explores the inter- relationships between the spatial nature of sound, silence, focus, perception and the act of listening itself.Demers, Joanna. Listening Through The Noise. New York: Oxford University Press. 2010. pp. 75-78 History Chartier's sound works and sound installations have been presented internationally including at the exhibits Sounding Spaces at ICC (Tokyo, Japan), I Moderni / The Moderns at Castello di Rivoli (Torino, Italy), 2002 Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY), Resynthesis at The Art Institute of Chicago and with the traveling sound exhibit Invisible Cities created by digital media curators Fehler as well as solo and collaborative installations for Fusebox (DC), 1515 Arts/G Fine Art (DC), Die Schachtel (Milan, Italy), and Diapason (NY). He has performed his work live across Europe, Japan, Australia, and North America at MUTEK (Montreal, Canada), GRM/Maison de Radio France (Paris, France), Observatori (Valencia, Spain), DEAF (Dublin, Ireland), Transmediale (Berlin, Germany), Lovebytes (Sheffield, UK), The Leeds International Film Festival (Leeds, UK), the Rotterdam International Film Festival (NE), Garage (Stralsund, Germany), La Batie (Geneva, Switzerland), and other digital art/music festivals and at exhibits such as Frequenzen [Hz] at the Schirn Kunsthalle (Frankfurt) and A Minimal Future? Art as Object 1958-1968 and Visual Music at the Museum of Contemporary Art (Los Angeles). The book Blocks of Consciousness and the Unbroken Continuum (Sound323, UK, 2006) contains the chapter \\"On the surface of silence: reticence in the music of Richard Chartier‚Äù in which author and critic Will Montgomery writes \\"Chartier's work has this overriding singleness of formal vision. While it is clearly formed of discrete parts, the work doesn't look beyond itself, it doesn't refer to other sounds or musical instruments, it is entirely conceived within the field of digital sound. And, like Donald Judd's three-dimensional objects, it is faithful to itself as a medium: the audio is self-sufficient. Chartier allows his pieces to be governed by their own internal dynamics,finding specific arrangements of sound that integrate the various sonic objects he chooses to work with into coherent wholes.... The music has tended to be categorised in terms of an exemplary austerity. It is easy to see why. However, close listening reveals both a vacuum ‚Äì that absolute digital silence ‚Äì and an answering fullness. The counterpart of the work's vanishing quality is its urge to make itself present. To a degree, this is attributable to the way in which the ear bodies out the sounds it cannot quite grasp ‚Äì the aural fantasy that the work brings into play. At the same time, it is work of extreme concentration and the sounds that are there in the music are rich with information. The work is ultimately experienced in terms of density as well sparseness, sensuality as well as coolness. The form of minimalism that Chartier has developed on his CDs favours listening conditions that are private, introverted and solitary. Yet the bareness of the works is illusory: under the microscope that he obliges each listener to peer down, a pulsating aural life becomes apparent.\\" In 2000 he formed the recording label LINE and has since curated its continuing documentation of compositional and installation work by international sound artists and composers exploring the aesthetics of contemporary and digital minimalism (including noted artists such as Bernhard Gunter, Steve Roden, Taylor Deupree, Christopher Willits, Roel Meelkop, Carsten Nicolai/Alva Noto, Asmus Tietchens, Mark Fell and the first full-length CDs by Miki Yui, Skoltz_Kolgen, and Steinbruchel). The premiere release on LINE, Chartier's Series was awarded Honorable Mention in the category of Digital Music by the Prix Ars Electronica, 2001 (Austria). In 2006 he was commissioned by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden to create a collaborative sound performance work in conjunction with the Hiroshi Sugimoto retrospective exhibit. This work, entitled Specification. Fifteen, was recently awarded one of five Honorable Mentions for outstanding contemporary artistic positions in digital media art by the Jury of Transmediale.07 Award Competition (Germany) and exhibited as a recording and presented as a live performance with a new video work created from Sugimoto's Seascapes at the Akademie der Kuenste (Berlin). In 2009, Richard Chartier presented a collaborative installation with visual artist Linn Meyers where optical and sonic patterns intersect. Untitled, exhibited at the Art Gallery of University of Maryland (US) two by walls meet in an enfolding chevron, creating both a sound chamber and a drawing surface. The swirling lines of Meyers' drawing, made directly on the surface of the walls, fuse together with the sound piece by Chartier, juxtaposing the organic and the digital into unified sensorial space. With eight audio transducers applied directly to the back surface of the walls, Chartier's composition modulates and transfers through the surfaces. Untitled(Angle.1), a stereo composition based on Untitled was released on Non Visual Objects (Austria) as a limited edition compact disc. In March 2010, Chartier was awarded a Smithsonian Institution Artist Research Fellowship to explore the National Museum of American History‚Äôs collection of 19th Century acoustic apparatus for scientific demonstration. Chartier will focus specifically on the many sirens, waveforms, and other inventions of the German physicist Rudolf Koenig including the Grand Tonometer (c. 1870-1875), the only instrument of its kind in existence. Chartier studied at James Madison University (Harrisonburg, VA) from 1989‚Äì1993 and received Bachelor of Fine Arts Cum Laude with a Concentration in Graphic Design and Painting.

A son of Erekle I by a concubine, he was born and raised as a Muslim at the Safavid court of Iran. In 1703, Shah of Iran Husayn appointed him a darugha (prefect) of his capital Isfahan. In 1722, he was confirmed by the shah as King of Kakheti following the death of Constantine's brother David II (ImƒÅm Qulƒ´ KhƒÅn). At the same time, he was bestowed with the governorship of Erivan, Ganja, and Karabakh. He frequently feuded with his western neighbor and kinsman, Vakhtang VI of Kartli, who was declared by the Persian government deposed in 1723. On the shah's orders, Constantine marched to take control of Vakhtang's capital Tbilisi. On May 4, 1723, he captured the city, but failed to evict Vakhtang and his son Bakar from the province of Shida Kartli. Meanwhile, the Ottoman army invaded the Georgian lands in order to eliminate the Persian hegemony there. Constantine tried to negotiate with the Ottoman commander Ibrahim-Pasha and surrendered Tbilisi on June 12, 1723. However, Vakhtang VI managed to bribe Ibrahim-Pasha who installed Prince Bakar as governor of Kartli and arrested Constantine. Soon, Bakar conspired with Constantine, his former rival, against the Ottoman overlords and helped him flee to his possessions in Kakheti. A revolt failed, however, and Bakar had to join his father Vakhtang VI in his Russian exile in 1724. Constantine withdrew into the mountains whence he led resistance against the Turks. In 1725, he succeeded in reestablishing himself in Kakheti and made peace with the Ottomans who recognized him as king in exchange of his conversion to Sunni Islam and paying an annual tribute. Early in the 1730s, as Nader Khan Afshar pushed his quest to revive the Persian empire, Constantine made a fatal attempt to break with the Turks. He was murdered at Bezhanbagh on December 28, 1732, during the negotiations with Yusuf Pasha of Akhaltsikhe, the commander of the invading Ottoman troops. The Turks gave his throne to his Christian brother, Teimuraz II.*Mikaberidze, Alexander (ed., 2007). Constanine II. Dictionary of Georgian National Biography.

Historically, all police stations had a small number of individual cells where offenders could be detained. However, in recent years most detainees are more likely to be taken to a large police station which are designated to hold prisoners. Facilities There are numerous facilities contained within the custody suite, which most commonly include: Holding cells used in Leith Police Station from 1833 to 2003 * A holding cell where officers wait with prisoners awaiting entry to the suite. * A number of cells for detaining prisoners, often split into male, female and juvenile groups of cells. * A prisoner processing area where custody officers (most commonly uniformed sergeants) process the prisoners presented to them by police officers * Designated interview rooms, holding equipment used to conduct and record interviews with suspects for use as evidence. * A medical room for use by police medical staff * Consultation rooms where detained persons can consult with their legal representatives. * Rooms used for video identification parades or similar. * A room officers can complete the necessary arrest documentation after their prisoners have been legally and formally logged in as held in custody. Procedure Upon arrival at the suite, the police officer who has made an arrest presents the suspect at a desk before the custody officer explaining the reason and details of the arrest and evidence gained. If the custody officer is satisfied that the person has been lawfully detained, they will authorise further detention of the person. The detainee would then be asked a series of questions regarding their personal details and informed of their rights whilst in custody under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Act 2010 in Scotland. Before being allocated a cell and a record being made of the time detained, the detainee is usually searched with any item they are carrying removed and in some cases if forensic evidence has to be preserved. All items of clothing and personal items taken from the detainee are logged and held in a secure place until the detainee's departure. The arresting officer will then complete the necessary documentation for the arrest and may conduct brief further enquiries (including a tape recorded interview with the suspect) before the suspect is brought before the custody officer again for disposal. This disposal could take numerous forms, the most common being that the person is charged with an offence, given police bail in order for further investigation to be carried out, or released without any charge. Independent custody visitors may make unannounced visits to custody suites to ensure that people being detained are treated properly.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange went as far as to instituting a \\"Dorfman Rule\\", where exchange authorities could halt trading in a stock that Dorfman referred to on television.Marketplace, NPR Radio, Oct 27, 1995 The NASDAQ also considered controlling volatility caused by Dorfman's on-air picks. The NASDAQ proposed to sometimes suspend trading in any stock mentioned by \\"a well known, recognized, and influential stock analyst or commentator,\\" and confirmed they were talking about Dorfman. Dorfman supported the \\"Dorfman Rule\\": \\"I'm not looking to cause volatility in stocks. I'm not looking to cause them to go up or down.

A curfew prohibited anyone under 19 from being out after 9 o'clock, so he had to hide his identity to avoid trouble with the police. He wore a mask and wrestled as Black Diablo. After he turned 20, he wrestled without the mask under his real name. Tennessee In 1962, Bulfone moved to the United States to wrestle, originally under the name Mario La Pantera.

Biography From 1702 to 1706 Heister studied at the Universities of Giessen and Wetzlar, afterwards relocating to Amsterdam, where he studied anatomy under Frederik Ruysch (1638‚Äì1731). In the summer of 1707, he was an assistant physician in field hospitals at Brussels and Ghent during the War of the Spanish Succession. He then traveled to Leiden, where he studied anatomy under Bernhard Siegfried Albinus (1653‚Äì1721) and Govert Bidloo (1649‚Äì1713), also attending Hermann Boerhaave‚Äôs lectures on chemistry and ocular diseases. In 1708 he earned his doctorate from the University of Harderwijk, and in the summer of 1709, rejoined the Dutch military as a field surgeon during the Siege of Tournai. Shortly afterwards, he distinguished himself in treatment of the wounded from the Battle of Malplaquet. Surgical devices from Heister's \\"Institutiones chirurgicae\\". In 1711 he was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery at the University of Altdorf, and from 1720, was a professor of anatomy and surgery at Helmstedt, where he remained for rest of his life. During his tenure at Helmstedt, he also taught classes in botany and practical medicine. In 1730 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Among his numerous writings, his best-known work is Chirurgie, a book on surgery that was translated into several languages. It was used extensively in Japan, and was still employed as a standard text at Vienna as late as 1838. Heister's botanical garden in Helmstedt was considered one of the most beautiful in Germany. In 1718, he coined the word \\"tracheotomy\\". Also, he is credited for being the first physician to perform a post-mortem section of appendicitis. His name is lent to the plant genus Heisteria, as well as to the spiral valves of Heister, defined as anatomical folds of the cystic duct. He died in Bornum am Elm. His botanical writings were published as Beschreibung eines neuen Geschlechts in 1755, with illustrated descriptions of plants.

The team maintaining the HyperFun project is a freely associated group of researchers and students from different countries from all over the world (UK, Russia, France, Japan, Norway, USA, and others) called the Digital Materialization Group (digitalmaterial.org).  Overview  HyperFun allows users to easily model objects of the quality found in reality and nature. The system is based on a new mathematical framework for geometry, function representation (FRep), which provides a uniform method to model both surface geometry and internal composition simultaneously. It is also a compact and precise framework that can represent objects with unlimited complexity and properties. Compared to traditional modeling systems, HyperFun is able to digitally describe, create and modify models of any real or imagined object or environment.  Concepts  Technically, complex geometric objects in HyperFun are constructed from simple primitives on which various operations are performed. Any object in three-dimensional space is defined by a function of point coordinates F(x,y,z). This continuous real function is positive inside the object, negative outside, and takes zero value on its surface. Similarly, a multidimensional object is defined by a function of several variables F(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn). For example, an object changing over time can be defined by F(x,y,z,t) with t representing time. Attributes such as color or material density are also defined by corresponding functions. This constitutes the new paradigm of procedural function-based volume modeling and rendering, where an object's shape and properties are locally evaluated on request using black box procedures.

Life  Born in Paris in 1830, Nehlig studied painting under L√©on Cogniet and Abel de Pujol. In 1850, he moved to the United States, where he would live and work for the next 22 years, interrupted only by a brief stay in Havana, Cuba. During his time in the United States, Nehlig opened a studio in New York City and painted a variety of works in the academic style, often demonstrating his prowess at depicting the human figure. Nehlig returned to his native France in 1872, two years after being elected an academician in the National Academy of Design and shortly after his studio and many of his reference materials were destroyed in a devastating fire. He died in 1909 in New York City.  Works  While Nehlig was relatively well known among art enthusiasts during his time, his work has seen less attention in subsequent years. He frequently painted interpretations of American history, taking a special interest in scenes from the American Civil War, the effects of which he witnessed firsthand.

The Declaration was issued in Singapore on 22 January 1971 at the conclusion of the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). Along with the Harare Declaration, issued in 1991, it is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth's uncodified constitution. The declaration opens with a description of the Commonwealth's identity, the relationship between the organisation and its members, and its fundamental goals: The second article describes the extent and diversity of the Commonwealth, encompassing both rich nations and poor across six continents and five oceans. The third article states, at the height of the Cold War, that membership of the Commonwealth is compatible with membership of any other international organisation or non- alignment. The next ten articles in turn detail some of the core political principles of the Commonwealth. These include (in the order in which they are mentioned): world peace and support for the United Nations; individual liberty and egalitarianism; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and economic inequality; free trade; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international coercion. These are summed up in the final article, which serves as a touchstone for Commonwealth principles: The part of the declaration considered the most troubling was the last to be mentioned: 'rejecting coercion as an instrument of policy'. The implication is that not even the Commonwealth itself has any right to enforce its other core values, as that would be using coercion. This apparent conflict was resolved by the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which clearly mandates the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.

It lies approximately north-northwest of Cairns in Queensland, about east-north-east of Cape Grenville on the Cape York Peninsula. Raine Island is the site of the oldest European structure in tropical Australia, a stone beacon built in 1844, and harbours the world's largest remaining population of green turtles (Chelonia mydas). An important environmental icon, the island is totally protected from public access. It got its name from Captain Thomas Raine (1793‚Äì1860), the English mariner who discovered it. Geography Raine Island is a vegetated coral cay dominated by low herbaceous annual vegetation (Batianoff et al. 1993). The cay is composed of a central core of phosphate rock surrounded by sand and extensive fringing reefs. It lies just off the eastern edge of the continental shelf, next to a shipping channel known as the Raine Island Entrance and Pandora entrance. The entrance allows shipping to enter the water of the Great Barrier Reef. Environment Turtles A green turtle. Raine Island harbours the largest population of these sea creatures in the world. Raine Island is the largest and most important green sea turtle nesting area in the world, with up to 18,000 females nesting on the small coral sand cay in one season. The turtle population can vary from a figure of less than 1,000 to more than 10,000 and has been found to correlate with the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. The waters surrounding Raine Island are so active that seeing over 250 turtles during an hour in the water is common. The nesting site has been active on the island for more than 1,000 years, making it the longest known marine turtle rookery anywhere in the world. Up to 100,000 nesting females have been observed in a season, with the cay producing 90% of the region's green turtles. However, the hatching rate declined in the 1990s, and a further decline in the population was threatened by the deaths of thousands of females as they struggled to climb the small sandy cliffs. In addition, as the shape of the island had changed over time, the spread of the beaches outwards had led to greater risk of inundation of the turtle nests. Between 2011 and 2020, a collaborative project by the Queensland Government, BHP (as corporate sponsor), the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and Wuthathi and Meriam traditional owners, reshaped the island using heavy machinery in a way that gave the female turtles a smoother passage and reduced the risk of nest inundation. A sophisticated monitoring and research system, using 3D modelling, satellite technology and drones was employed, and monitoring continues. , a project called \\"The Turtle Cooling Project\\" is being undertaken by scientists from the World Wildlife Fund Australia, University of Queensland, Deakin University and the Queensland Government. It is looking at the effect of global warming on northern green turtle breeding, in particular the effect of producing more male turtles owing to the higher temperatures. They are working in the area around Raine Island, Heron Island and Moulter Cay. Birds More than 30 bird species have been observed on the island. The island holds special significance as a seabird breeding and roosting site. It is considered as the most significant tropical seabird breeding site in the Great Barrier Reef. The Raine Island National Park (Scientific), which includes not only Raine Island (21 ha) but also the neighbouring Moulter () and MacLennan () Cays, has been identified by BirdLife International as a Important Bird Area because it supports, or has supported, over 1% of the world populations of nesting masked and brown boobies, common and black noddies, as well as regionally significant populations of herald petrels, red-footed boobies and red-tailed tropicbirds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Raine Island, Moulter and Maclennan Cays. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 26/09/2011. History Raine Island falls within the traditional lands and waters of the Wuthathi Aboriginal people, who share their interests in the area with Torres Strait Islander peoples the Erubam Le (Darnley Island), the Ugarem Le (Stephen Island) and Meriam Le (Murray Island).Premier Peter Beattie & Minister Lindy Nelson-Carr Media Release, August 22, 2007, World's Largest Green Turtle Rookery Given Highest Protection Status Accessed 18 February 2009 During the 1890s the island was mined for guano. The beacon and the Raine Island Corporation The waters around the island were treacherous for early European navigators. More than thirty shipwrecks can be found off the coast of the island including , a vessel that in 1791 was involved in the capture of a group of mutineers from . As a consequence, the beacon was built by convict labour in 1844, on the orders of the British Admiralty. It is the oldest European structure in the Australian tropics. The stone used in its construction was quarried from the island's phosphate rock, the timber salvaged from shipwrecks, and shells burnt to make lime for mortar. The structure took four months to complete. While the beacon never served as a lighthouse, it is visible over from the island. Over the years the structure deteriorated; undermining, stone bedding loss, natural erosion, harsh weather and lightning strikes all contributed to its dilapidation. In 1988 the Raine island Corporation carried out repairs to secure the structure, for which it was honoured with the Australian Bicentennial National Trust of Queensland John Herbert Award for Excellence in Heritage Conservation. The beacon is considered one of the most important historical monuments in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and the Commonwealth Register of the National Estate. The Raine Island Corporation was a self-funding statutory authority established under the auspices of the Meaker Trust (Raine Island Research) Act 1981. The Corporation's goals were to promote research into, and to ensure the preservation and protection of, the natural and cultural heritage resources of Raine Island, the Moulter and Maclennan Cays and the surrounding seas. The Act was revoked in 2005, the Corporation disbanded, and the gifted funds redirected elsewhere for other purposes. National Park (Scientific) In August 2007 Raine Island, along with the neighbouring Moulter and MacLennan Cays, was declared a National Park (Scientific) under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. > \\"Not only does Raine Island have the largest known green turtle rookery in > the world with tens of thousands of turtles coming to lay their eggs each > year, it is home to the endangered herald petrel and the vulnerable red- > tailed tropic bird and is arguably the most significant seabird rookery on > the Great Barrier Reef,\\" > \\"By upgrading Raine Island from Nature Refuge status to National Park > (Scientific), its special values and adjacent cays and ensuring nature > conservation research can continue to be conserved.\\" By declaring Raine Island to be National Park (Scientific), the seabirds and turtles breeding colonies were able to be provided the State's highest possible level of legal protection, strictly limiting all access to scientific research and essential management only. The declaration was made possible by the Wuthathi people and interested Torres Strait Islanders entering into a special Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the State, formally registering the agreement with National Native Title Tribunal, and so allowing the declaration to proceed.ATNS Database of Agreements, Treaties, and Negotiated Settlements Entry \\"Raine Island National Park (Scientific) Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA)\\" Accessed 18 February 2009 Heritage listings Raine Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Eastern end of Raine Island: Raine Island Beacon See also * List of islands of Australia  References  External links * *About Raine Island Category:Protected areas of Far North Queensland Category:Important Bird Areas of Queensland Category:Islands of Far North Queensland ","title":"Raine Island"},{"id":"12433078","text":"Alan Peterson may refer to: *Alan Peterson (director), American director of Fahrenhype 9/11 *Alan Peterson, Antarctic Automatic Weather Stations Project 1978 See also * Allan Pettersson Swedish composer ","title":"Alan Peterson"},{"id":"12433088","text":"Sean McAllister (born 2 May 1965) is a British documentary filmmaker.

The palace is a national landmark and is included in the UNESCO Cultural Landscape of Sintra World Heritage Site listing.  Etymology  View from the palace gardens. Jose Alfredo mentions in ‚ÄúSeteais fields‚Äù that this field is very old and has always been an integral part of the precinct behind the palace. Some people believe that its name comes from the tradition of shouting ‚Äúai‚Äù on the road where its echo is repeated 7 times. On the other hand, a very old manuscript by an anonymous author kept in Sintra library mentions that the origin of the word of Seteais derives from the land named Centeais where rye () was being cultivated. History Jo√£o VI of Portugal and Queen Carlota Joaquina of Spain to Seteais Palace. The Seteais Palace was built between 1783 and 1787 for the Dutch consul Daniel Gildemeester, on lands granted by the Marquis of Pombal. Although Daniel Gildemeester had a land in the neighborhood of Quinta da Alegria property, there was not any house to live in. So Gildemeester had lived in the Palace of Marquis of Pombal as a tenant during summer. He started to build his own mansion close to the property (Monserrate Palace) of his friend British consul Gerard de Visme in order to leave the Palace of Marquis of Pombal. The consul chose to build his house on the border of an elevation, from which the vast landscape around the Sintra hills could be admired. The palace was surrounded with a large garden with fruit trees. In 1797, some years after the consul's death, his widow sold the palace to Diogo Jos√© Vito de Menezes Noronha Coutinho, 5th Marquis of Marialva. The palace was enlarged between 1801 and 1802, probably by neoclassical architect Jos√© da Costa e Silva, author of the S√£o Carlos Theatre in Lisbon. The palace was turned into a symmetrical U-shaped building, with the consul's house becoming one of its wings. The cornice of the buildings that compose the main fa√ßade was decorated with typical neoclassical motifs like vases, busts and reliefs of garlands. The gardens of the palace were remodelled following romantic trends. The old and the new wings were connected in 1802 by a neoclassical arch, built in honour of Prince regent John VI and Princess Carlota Joaquina, who visited the palace in that year. The monumental arch, decorated with the bronze effigies of the royal pair and a commemorative Latin inscription, is attributed to architect Francisco Leal Garcia. The walls of several inner rooms of the palace were decorated with frescos attributed to French painter Jean Pillement and his followers. Painted motifs include exotic vegetation and mythological characters, typical of the neoclassical taste. After changing hands several times, the palace was acquired by the Portuguese government in 1946. The Seteais Palace has been used as a luxury hotel since 1954 but its original characteristics have been preserved.

The title can also be translated as \\"The glass border\\". An English translation was published in 1997. Basic plot A series of short stories which explores relationships between people of Mexico and the United States. There are many connections between the stories, such as characters that appear in multiple stories (the most prominent of which is the wealthy Mexican businessman, Leonardo Barroso). A major, recurring theme in the text is that large parts of the USA were once part of Mexico, all the way from California to Texas, and so the Mexican people feel a special connection with that area. Another important idea is that both countries depend on each other for trade and culture, and many people divide their time and their lives between both sides of the border. In the second story a Mexican student goes to medical school in New York state, where he finds that people there know nothing about the conditions in Mexico, but feel ready to make judgments. Index The novel is made up of nine short stories, which take place on both sides of the Rio Grande/R√≠o Bravo. The stories are: # La capitalina (translated as \\"A Capital Girl\\") # La pena (translated as \\"Pain\\") # El despojo (translated as \\"Spoils\\") # La raya del olvido (translated as \\"The Line of Oblivion\\") # Malintzin de las maquilas (translated as \\"Malintzin of the Maquilas\\") # Las amigas (translated as \\"The Friends\\") # La frontera de cristal (translated as \\"The Crystal Frontier\\") # La apuesta (translated as \\"The Bet\\") # R√≠o Grande, r√≠o Bravo (translated as \\"Rio Grande, R√≠o Bravo\\") Story Summaries La capitalina The protagonist, Michelina, is a young woman who grew up in Mexico City and is the daughter of a very old Mexican family. Her family has become poor over time, but still sticks to the aristocratic traditions and values. The very rich man Leonardo Barroso from northern Mexico offers his ‚Äúprotection‚Äù services to the family as Michelina's godfather. To seal the deal, he invites Michelina up to his northern town Campazas for a visit, to meet his son Marianito, with whom Michelina will be set up to get married. There is emphasis on the contrast between Mexico City (which is presumed to be polished) and northern Mexico (which seems more liberal, but also flaunts the accessibility to the border and the U.S... Location is POWER!). There is also some problematization of expected gender roles and familial relationships... Michelina frequently reflects on female purity and subtlety (most prominently exemplified in her fixation on old-fashioned clothing, especially the crinoline, and on Mexico's historical connection to Catholicism and especially nuns), but she is also a confident and strong woman. In turn, Marianito is supremely introverted and timid and doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with women; he just wants to be left alone. Meanwhile, Michelina and her father-in-law-to-be are totally crushing on each other. However, anything can be bought, and Michelina agrees to marry Marianito; the story ends with their wedding, after which Michelina and Leonardo flit across the border to the U.S. and hook up at last. La pena Juan Zamora is the main character; the narrator tells Juan's story in a first person voice, while Juan ‚Äúkeeps his back to us.‚Äù Juan is a 23-year-old medical student from Mexico who goes to Cornell University for a postdoc. This is during the early 1980s, when Mexico has its oil peak and the Salvadoran Civil War is getting started. Money is a big theme, because Mexico has money from the oil peak yet still isn‚Äôt managing it well and is still corrupt. The theme of money and how to use it touches Juan personally since his father was a rare honest lawyer and his mother always resented him for not using bribes to make the family rich. After father's death, Juan's mother asked boss-man Leonardo Barroso (from story ‚ÄúLa capitalina‚Äù) to give Juan a grant for Cornell as a favor. Juan goes to live with an American Republican family, the Wingates, who are huge fans of Reagan and his policies of interference in Central America. At Cornell, Juan struggles to understand American society and to fit in, and to do so, he lies and says he's rich (from a Mexican landowners background). However, he only really fits in when he meets Jim, and they start dating. They try to focus on the present but there are glimpses of the huge cultural divide between them, and the Wingate family disapproves of their homosexuality. Eventually Jim breaks up with Juan because he has a certain future to maintain as part of the American aristocratic elite, and Juan abandons his studies and goes home to Mexico. Four years later, the Wingate family travels to Mexico and they have the idea to surprise Juan with a visit... they go to his address and are surprised that it's a dumpy little apartment complex, and Juan's not in. Juan, meanwhile, has a recurring dream of being with Jim at Cornell and committing suicide together. El despojo Dionisio ‚ÄúBaco‚Äù Rangel is a famous Mexican chef, who absolutely loves Mexican cuisine and spurns most other cuisine, especially the American/U.S. one. He works giving culinary classes at U.S. universities on two tours each year, but the students can‚Äôt appreciate the wonder of Mexican cuisine... Good cuisine is based on patience and time and the roots in the ‚Äúpueblo,‚Äù but U.S. cuisine is based on abundance and what's quick. Indeed, entire U.S. society is centered around abundance, consumption, and waste. Dionisio obsessively starts ‚Äúconsuming‚Äù these American products himself, acquiring a ton of junk, then he starts going to U.S. fast food restaurants to observe the great quantity of obese people. He starts sexually desiring fat white women, but doesn‚Äôt know how to approach them, so instead he goes to an American restaurant (link between food and sex). At the restaurant a genie comes out of a salsa de chile bottle, and Dionisio asks for various women, one with each plate he orders. He gets a bored anorexic girl from New York, an excited and immature/childlike woman in her 40s, a beautiful but unhappy business woman obsessively talking on her cellphone, a radiant and simple woman who's intelligent and adopted a little girl from Mexico, a talkative divorced woman in her 30s, and finally an angry obese woman who champions the ‚ÄúFat Liberation Movement.‚Äù Dionisio leaves the restaurant to escape the angry fat woman, and then he sees a mannequin of a stereotypical Mexican guy napping. He goes to tear it up because of the racism/discrimination and discovers it's an actual Mexican man who got lost in the mall 10 years ago and stays there working. Dionisio takes him back to the restaurant looking for the simple radiant woman, but she's gone because they‚Äôve thrown away the plate of food that represented her existence. So he takes the Mexican guy and they take off for the Mexican border, ditching all of their accumulated gringo stuff along the way... arriving at the border, Dioniosio smells delicious Mexican food... La raya del olvido The first person narrator is an old man sitting on a wheelchair, who doesn‚Äôt know who he is or where he is. He distinguishes that there is a dividing line, which he is straddling; this line is the U.S.-Mexico border, and he is torn between the U.S. and Mexico, not accepted in either. He is very confused, but eventually remembers his wife, Camelia, and then slowly starts to remember everything else. The narrator was a supporter of the fight for social justice (and particularly rights for immigrants); meanwhile his brother Leonardo Barroso (**intertextuality) totally played the system to get rich. The narrator's children hated him because he didn‚Äôt help them get financial success playing the system due to his social justice convictions. The narrator's children have chosen the U.S. over Mexico... and they have abandoned him anonymously as a reject communist. The narrator observes the border; it is in constant and unending flux, and the immigrants are at the mercy of the U.S. market. When they‚Äôre needed for labor, they‚Äôre welcomed, while when there are too many of them, they are shunned. Finally, at the end of the story, the narrator is picked up by an ambulance; there are finally people who want to help him, and he finally remembers who he is: Emiliano Barroso. Malintzin de las maquilas The protagonist Marina is a young woman who has come to the border city of Ju√°rez to work at a factory (maquiladora). She is dating a powerful macho man named Rolando, who she constantly obsesses over (worrying about his womanizer reputation), and whom she sees once a week (Thursdays) in a hotel across the border. The story all takes place on a Friday, starting in the morning with Marina's commute to the factory. Along the way, she hooks up with her work companions and friends: Dinorah (single mom), Rosa Lupe (married but her husband doesn‚Äôt work, takes care of the kids), and Candelaria (older, 30-year-old woman who has been educated by her mature lover and is very vocal about women getting fair working treatment). At the factory, they complain and swap stories, and compare their obligations and their backgrounds; they‚Äôre all from different areas of Mexico. On this particular day, Rosa Lupe is wearing religious garb, and the older female supervisor strips it off her in public and sexually assaults her; a male supervisor comes over and breaks it up so Rosa Lupe lets him see her change clothes as a thank you, then they go on break. Meanwhile, the company owner Leonardo Barroso chats with North American execs about the success of the factory system, and how it's liberating for Mexican women (B.S.), and then suggests the get-rich scheme to buy cheap land then sell it for tons of money to build more factories there. The women get off work and go out dancing at a club for Friday night girls‚Äô night out. They watch the Chippendale male dancers there, and Dinorah gets irritated for some reason and leaves. When the women leave the club, they hear tragic news: Dinorah's young son has died; he strangled himself because she left him tied up to a table in her home while she was at work all day. Marina is desperate and fixates on her desire to go to the beach with Rolando to see the sea... she can‚Äôt get in touch with him on his cellphone so she goes to the Texas hotel to see him. She finds him having sex with a gringa and discovers his famous cellphone isn‚Äôt even real; he just has it to look powerful. She is totally disillusioned and the story ends with her crossing the bridge back to Ju√°rez, while Leonardo Barroso and his daughter-in-law Michelina pass her on their way into El Paso. Las amigas The ancient and very difficult widow Miss Amy Dunbar lives alone in Chicago, and she treats all her servants terribly, and only maintains her relationship with her sole nephew Archibald under the threat of disinheriting him. She has had several black servants that she ran out of the house, so Archibald, who is now dating a Mexican woman in his international relationship line-up, suggests that she get a Mexican servant. Archibald is a lawyer and is working on the case of an immigrant who was falsely accused of murder; his Chicana wife Josefina needs work to help him financially, so Josefina starts working for Miss Amy. Miss Amy seeks any way possible to offend/insult Josefina, but the Mexican maid is quite astute. One theme that arises continually is Josefina's strong Catholic faith: she keeps religious symbols in her room and Miss Amy scorns her as idolatrous. Miss Amy also attacks her based on race, suggesting that perhaps Josefina would like to be white. But Josefina continually deflects Miss Amy's attacks with patience and cleverness. Miss Amy eventually proposes that Josefina can have a party in the garden, then spies on the party; her repulsion is confirmed by the Mexicans‚Äô sheer otherness, and she throws everyone out of the house. Nephew Archibald angrily accuses Miss Amy of purposefully humiliating Josefina. In his anger, he reveals that his father didn‚Äôt marry her because she was frigid and unloving, which left Amy to marry his brother instead. He then renounces his inheritance, and informs Miss Amy that Josefina's husband's appeal has been denied and he will have to stay in jail. Miss Amy, in her shock, expresses her sentiments of regret for Josefina's husband's fate to her maid, and then allows for a moment of intimacy/affection after Josefina declares that she will continue fighting for her husband, whom she will always faithfully love. La frontera de cristal Story opens with the famous businessman Leonardo Barroso, who is on a flight to New York with his lover and daughter-in-law, Michelina. He's heading a post-NAFTA initiative to bring in migrant workers for a weekend and then take them back to Mexico (to address the need for labor force contrasted with the insistence that the immigrants be legal and the desire to not really have a bunch of Mexican immigrants around for good). The main character is Lisandro Ch√°vez, a Mexican whose family was rich before the economic crash: this type of employment was never his plan, but needs must, since his father's business failed. The economic crisis (post oil peak of 70s and early 80s, going through the 80s and 90s) changed everything... the country is corrupt and failed. Don Leonardo's thoughts about Lisandro represent the internal discrimination/racism that exists in Mexico: he seems him as more decent-faced because he's lighter skinned. Meanwhile, Michelina is presented as a sort of foil to Lisandro, because her family also fell in the economic crisis but her fate is different since she hooked up with Leonardo. Leonardo, Michelina, and the 93 workers arrive in New York, where they will be working cleaning office buildings over the weekend while all the normal workers are at home. The first job is to clean a huge glass building, and a lone woman (Audrey) has come in that day to work. She is separated from her husband and feels free just being able to be out of his grasp, in the office, alone... she forgot the workers would be there. She is in her office and Lisandro is cleaning on that floor; they start looking at each other and very subtly interacting with one another through the glass walls of the office building. She thinks that he seems like a courteous man, and starts to imagine how he would act with her, what he's like... meanwhile, he sees her as melancholy, which contrasts with his vision of gringas as strong and confident. He wishes he could tell her that his true identity doesn‚Äôt match the appearance, this type of work was never his plan. They more and more obviously stare at one another, and then she gets a lipstick and writes her name on the glass that separates them. He hesitates and then only writes his nationality, rather than his name: ‚ÄúMexican.‚Äù Then they kiss through the glass, but, when she opens her eyes, he's gone. La apuesta We follow two plot lines simultaneously in this story, switching back and forth. The first one is of a Mexican tour chauffeur/guide named Leandro; today he has a tour to Cuernavaca with three people: a Spanish woman, and a Mexican guy and a gringa who are a couple. He has a very bad attitude and is irritated that this dark-skinned Mexican is with the gringa when he's not... yet the Spanish woman observes him and calls him out on his behavior. Leandro meets some guys at the gas station and tries to act macho and smooth but the Spanish woman, Encarna, totally humiliates him. Yet, they start a conversation and Leandro shares his history (was totally held back by his father and had to drag himself out of his humble past), and they connect, and end up sleeping together when they get back to D.F., then they start a long-distance relationship and keep in touch through letters. Leandro randomly meets don Leonardo Barroso, who likes the way he drives and invites him to travel to Spain with him and Michelina to be their driver. Leandro agrees and arranges to meet Encarna; they have a happy reunion and she plans to return to Mexico with him, and they decide to take a trip to Madrid for the weekend. Meanwhile, there's a group of guys in Spain (unnamed) who constantly make bets and challenge each other and pick on the town idiot, Paquito. One of them ends up severely beating Paquito (frustration at being stuck in this small town with no future) to the point that he dies... Paquito's father comes wanting vengeance and challenges the one who beat up his son... A bet: they have to drive through a tunnel towards each other in the wrong lane... whoever comes out alive gets the money. In the tunnel, the two plot lines collide... Leandro and Encarna are in the tunnel at the same time as Paquito's abuser and Paquito's father... CRASH, and the story ends thus.

She served her country in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For her very dangerous work under combat conditions, she was awarded seven battle stars by war's end. Mascoma, built by the Marinship Corp., Sausalito, California, under Maritime Commission contract, was launched on 31 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. C. Ryan; converted by the Swan Island Yard, Kaiser Corp., Portland, Oregon; accepted and commissioned on 3 February 1944, Comdr. C. C. Eden in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  On 14 May 1944, Mascoma got underway for the Pacific theater to serve as a fleet oiler. She arrived at Kwajalein on 4 June and fueled ships there until departing for Majuro on the 13th. At Majuro through the 21st she encountered her first experience with boiler trouble, an experience which was to be repeated throughout her wartime operations. In spite of boiler problems, she sailed for Eniwetok on the 22nd, taking up fueling assignments there on the 25th and effecting repairs to her boilers. Toward the end of July the oiler steamed for the fueling area off Saipan, remaining in support of the Saipan, Tinian, and Guam operations until 1 August. She then consolidated her fuel into and departed for Eniwetok en route to Pearl Harbor.  Supporting attack on the Philippines  Resupplied, Mascoma returned to Majuro on 2 September, continuing on to Manus the following week. She arrived in the Admiralties on the 13th and departed again on the 18th to lend support to the first carrier task force attack on the Philippines. On 26 September, while in the fueling area, the tanker again developed boiler trouble and was dead in the water for over 16 hours. Having effected temporary repairs during that time, she returned to Manua arriving on 1 October and remaining until the 10th for further repairs.  Mississinewa hit by kaiten and explodes  Mascoma next sailed for Kossol Roads, where she served as station tanker from 13 October through 18 November. She then steamed for Ulithi, arriving on the 19th. At anchor at Ulithi the next morning, her crew witnessed the first use of one of Japan's weapons of last resort, the \\"kaiten\\" human torpedo. On that morning, 20 November, , moored near Mascoma, was rocked with explosions caused by a direct hit with a kaiten launched from the . This suicide sortie had been led by Lt. Sekio Nishinu, one of the kaiten's inventors. Boatcrews from Mascoma rescued 21 survivors from Mississinewa.  Riding out a typhoon  Nine days later Mascoma attempted to return to the fueling area, but was turned back by heavy weather. She departed again for the area on 10 December, but, on the 16th, was forced by an approaching typhoon to break off operations. On the 17th boiler trouble again caused her to cut off her engines. Underway nine hours later, she rode out the storm with only one boiler in operation. On the 19th she resumed fueling operations and returned to Ulithi for repairs on the 24th.  Stateside yard availability  The next month, January 1945, she sailed to California for Navy Yard availability at San Pedro, California, returning to Ulithi on 18 April. The next day she was en route to Okinawa to supply fuel to the forces in that campaign. Before mid-July, she returned to that area three times, replenishing, after each fueling period, at Ulithi.  End-of-war activity  On 10 July, Mascoma departed Ulithi to rendezvous with units of task group TG 38.1, then involved in attacks on the Japanese home islands. She returned to Ulithi on 1 August, replenished her supplies and was underway again by the 8th. On the 9th engine trouble once again forced Mascoma to drop out of formation. Ordered to Saipan, she was unable to rejoin her task group until the 20th, by which time hostilities had ended. She continued fueling at sea operations until the 28th, when she steamed for Japan. In Japan she carried out harbor fueling assignments at Sagami Wan, before proceeding to Tokyo Bay, she was the first ship in the harbor after Japan surrendered, as she was the closest ship at the time, where she witnessed the official surrender on 2 September. The next day, 3 September, she returned to Ulithi for fueling assignments and, again, repairs to her boilers. On 24 October, the oiler departed for the United States, arriving on 26 November at Norfolk, Virginia, where she decommissioned on 17 December. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 January 1946, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 27 June 1946. Returned to the Navy, she was accepted by the 3rd Naval District and reactivated on 4 February 1948. In August 1949 she was berthed at Orange, Texas, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, but was reactivated again on 27 July 1950.  Supporting the Korean War effort  From that time through 1959 she served as a non-commissioned Naval vessel USNS Mascoma (T-AO-83), manned by civilian personnel under contract to the Military Sea Transportation Service. In that capacity, Mascoma continued her record of wartime support by serving off the Korean coast from 14 February 1954 through the signing of the Armistice on 27 July, remaining in the area until 13 August 1953. For this service, performed as a merchant ship, she received the Korean Service Medal and the United Nations Korea Medal.  Decommissioning  She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 June 1959 and sold to Seatrain Lines Inc., for conversion to a containerized cargo ship. The ship was sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on 4 November 1966 under the MARAD Exchange Program and renamed Seatrain Oregon. She was transferred to Transwestern Associates, Inc. and renamed Transchamplain, IMO 6704476, in September 1967. In 1969 she was converted to a container ship by Savannah Machine and Foundry. Upon completion of the conversion she was sold to C.I.T. Corp. and began hauling containerized cargo for Seatrain Lines between U.S. west coast ports and Hawaii, Guam and other U.S. Pacific territories. In 1974 Transchamplain was leased to Matson, Inc. when Seatrain sold its Hawaiian operations to the Hawaiian-based shipping company. The ship was sold to be scrapped in 1980.  Awards  For her service during World War II, Mascoma was awarded seven battle stars.

It relates the singer's incomprehension of a failed relationship and her inadequate attempts at moving on with her life. \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" was released as the second single from Pieces of You and went on to receive a great deal of recognition. It became a hit and reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks (kept out from the top spot by Puff Daddy's Can't Nobody Hold Me Down), as well as number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for a single week. In 1997 a reissue of the single containing the unreleased \\"Foolish Games\\" allowed the song to rebound to number seven on the Hot 100, eventually totaling 65 weeks in the top 100, which at the time was a record. Worldwide, \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" experienced moderate success, reaching number three in Australia, number two in Canada and number 32 in the United Kingdom. \\"Foolish Games/You Were Meant for Me\\" ranked at number 15 on Billboard's All Time Top 100 in 2008.http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-20.shtml When the All Time chart was retabulated for the chart's 55th anniversary in 2013, it remained in the top 20 at number 17.http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top- songs?list_page=8 The song was also re-recorded for Jewel's Greatest Hits album with backing vocals from the country trio Pistol Annies. Background \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" was Jewel's second single to be taken from her debut album. Atlantic Records had Jewel re-record the song for a more radio-friendly version. Initially, the first version that was released was the \\"Juan Patino Radio Mix\\" (with a music video produced by Sean Penn). This version omits the first 2 lines of the chorus and the last 4 lines of the second verse, and did not gather much attention. It was later cancelled, with the video pulled from MTV and VH1. Jewel returned again into the studio to record the song for a third time, and the resulting version produced is known as the \\"radio version\\" and is featured on Greatest Hits. The original radio version, \\"Juan Patino Radio Mix\\", only appeared on a promotional LP titled Phyllis Barnabee Finally Gets a Bra in 1996, and its only commercial release came on a Canadian various artists compilation entitled \\"Now! 2\\" that same year. The actual \\"radio version\\" was released on a commercial CD single and later on a re-release of Pieces of You. Steve Poltz later referenced the record in his song, \\"Happier Hour\\", through the lyrics, \\"Did I ever tell you I wrote a hit with Jewel? I was truly meant for you and you were truly meant for me.\\" Composition \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" is written in the key of E minor with a moderate, swinging tempo of 114 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of C‚ÄìG/B‚ÄìC‚ÄìEm, and Jewel's vocals span from G3 to C5. Music video A music video was directed by Lawrence Carroll for the Radio Edit. Steve Poltz appeared in the video. In the video Jewel and Poltz appeared together in numerous scenes, most of them depicting how both of them wants to be together but always separated. In one scene, Poltz tries to reach for Jewel's hand, but a curtain appears between them and separating their hands. In another scene, Jewel lies in front of Poltz and starts to undress and reveals her underwear, but instead of reaching for him, she moves away from him, leaving Poltz with his arms raised towards her. Other scenes including Jewel lies beside a little pond with some little ships (which is also the single's cover), Jewel sits inside a boat in the middle of a room alone, and Jewel sits on a side of a bedroom while Poltz, shirtless, was in the other side and tries to reach towards her. The video won the award for Best Female Video at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards.

The general idea is to establish a \\"best estimate\\" for the true value of some system from an incomplete, potentially noisy set of observations on that system. The problem of optimal non-linear filtering (even for the non-stationary case) was solved by Ruslan L. Stratonovich (1959,Stratonovich, R. L. (1959). Optimum nonlinear systems which bring about a separation of a signal with constant parameters from noise. Radiofizika, 2:6, pp. 892-901. 1960Stratonovich, R.L. (1960).

Zeit. Wahrsch. 11 230‚Äì243. , , known as Zakai equation. The solution, however, is infinite- dimensional in the general case.Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel and Dominique Michel. Des resultats de non existence de filtre de dimension finie. Stochastics, 13(1+2):83-102, 1984. Certain approximations and special cases are well understood: for example, the linear filters are optimal for Gaussian random variables, and are known as the Wiener filter and the Kalman-Bucy filter. More generally, as the solution is infinite dimensional, it requires finite dimensional approximations to be implemented in a computer with finite memory. A finite dimensional approximated nonlinear filter may be more based on heuristics, such as the Extended Kalman Filter or the Assumed Density Filters,Maybeck, Peter S., Stochastic models, estimation, and control, Volume 141, Series Mathematics in Science and Engineering, 1979, Academic Press or more methodologically oriented such as for example the Projection Filters,Damiano Brigo, Bernard Hanzon and Fran√ßois LeGland, A Differential Geometric approach to nonlinear filtering: the Projection Filter, I.E.E.E. Transactions on Automatic Control Vol. 43, 2 (1998), pp 247--252. some sub- families of which are shown to coincide with the Assumed Density Filters.Damiano Brigo, Bernard Hanzon and Fran√ßois Le Gland, Approximate Nonlinear Filtering by Projection on Exponential Manifolds of Densities, Bernoulli, Vol. 5, N. 3 (1999), pp. 495--534 In general, if the separation principle applies, then filtering also arises as part of the solution of an optimal control problem. For example, the Kalman filter is the estimation part of the optimal control solution to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. The mathematical formalism Consider a probability space (Œ©, Œ£, P) and suppose that the (random) state Yt in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn of a system of interest at time t is a random variable Yt : Œ© ‚Üí Rn given by the solution to an It≈ç stochastic differential equation of the form :\\\\mathrm{d} Y_{t} = b(t, Y_{t}) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\sigma (t, Y_{t}) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_{t}, where B denotes standard p-dimensional Brownian motion, b : [0, +‚àû) √ó Rn ‚Üí Rn is the drift field, and œÉ : [0, +‚àû) √ó Rn ‚Üí Rn√óp is the diffusion field. It is assumed that observations Ht in Rm (note that m and n may, in general, be unequal) are taken for each time t according to :H_{t} = c(t, Y_{t}) + \\\\gamma (t, Y_{t}) \\\\cdot \\\\mbox{noise}. Adopting the It≈ç interpretation of the stochastic differential and setting : Z_{t} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} s, this gives the following stochastic integral representation for the observations Zt: :\\\\mathrm{d} Z_{t} = c(t, Y_{t}) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\gamma (t, Y_{t}) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} W_{t}, where W denotes standard r-dimensional Brownian motion, independent of B and the initial condition Y0, and c : [0, +‚àû) √ó Rn ‚Üí Rn and Œ≥ : [0, +‚àû) √ó Rn ‚Üí Rn√ór satisfy :\\\\big c (t, x) \\\\big + \\\\big \\\\gamma (t, x) \\\\big \\\\leq C \\\\big( 1 +  x  \\\\big) for all t and x and some constant C. The filtering problem is the following: given observations Zs for 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ t, what is the best estimate ≈∂t of the true state Yt of the system based on those observations? By \\"based on those observations\\" it is meant that ≈∂t is measurable with respect to the œÉ-algebra Gt generated by the observations Zs, 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ t. Denote by K = K(Z, t) be collection of all Rn-valued random variables Y that are square-integrable and Gt-measurable: :K = K(Z, t) = L^{2} (\\\\Omega, G_{t}, \\\\mathbf{P}; \\\\mathbf{R}^{n}). By \\"best estimate\\", it is meant that ≈∂t minimizes the mean-square distance between Yt and all candidates in K: :\\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[ \\\\big Y_{t} - \\\\hat{Y}_{t} \\\\big^{2} \\\\right] = \\\\inf_{Y \\\\in K} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[ \\\\big Y_{t} - Y \\\\big^{2} \\\\right]. \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(M)} Basic result: orthogonal projection The space K(Z, t) of candidates is a Hilbert space, and the general theory of Hilbert spaces implies that the solution ≈∂t of the minimization problem (M) is given by :\\\\hat{Y}_{t} = P_{K(Z, t)} \\\\big( Y_{t} \\\\big), where PK(Z,t) denotes the orthogonal projection of L2(Œ©, Œ£, P; Rn) onto the linear subspace K(Z, t) = L2(Œ©, Gt, P; Rn). Furthermore, it is a general fact about conditional expectations that if F is any sub-œÉ-algebra of Œ£ then the orthogonal projection :P_{K} : L^{2} (\\\\Omega, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mathbf{P}; \\\\mathbf{R}^{n}) \\\\to L^{2} (\\\\Omega, F, \\\\mathbf{P}; \\\\mathbf{R}^{n}) is exactly the conditional expectation operator E[¬∑F], i.e., :P_{K} (X) = \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\big[ X \\\\big  F \\\\big]. Hence, :\\\\hat{Y}_{t} = P_{K(Z, t)} \\\\big( Y_{t} \\\\big) = \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\big[ Y_{t} \\\\big  G_{t} \\\\big]. This elementary result is the basis for the general Fujisaki-Kallianpur-Kunita equation of filtering theory.

History Buzz is an anthropomorphic buzzard and con artist looking for ways to swindle Woody Woodpecker out of money or food. In other appearances, Buzz has been a cowboy, a carnival barker, and a soda jerk yet he still remained a royal pain to Woody. For most of Woody's career, Buzz was the primary foil for Woody, bearing roughly the same relationship to that character as Yosemite Sam had to Bugs Bunny in Warner Brothers' animated shorts, and Bluto to Popeye in the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts, both from the same era. Buzz's first appearance was opposite Woody in 1948's Wet Blanket Policy, the first and only animated short subject to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song, at which time he was more or less replacing Wally Walrus as Woody Woodpecker's primary foil. Character actor Lionel Stander provided his voice in the 1940s with Dallas McKennon taking over the role in the 1950s. Buzz would continue to appear in Woody Woodpecker shorts until the mid 1950s, and was eventually replaced as the woodpecker's rival himself by Dapper Denver Dooley (also voiced by McKennon) and later Gabby Gator. Bunco Busters would be Buzz Buzzard's final appearance in a Woody theatrical cartoon until Vicious Viking in 1967, in a chilly willy cartoon. Though Buzz continued to make appearances in Lantz comic books and on other licensed merchandise. During the 14 year theatrical hiatus, Buzz made an appearance in the 1964 television special, Spook-a-Nanny. However, in Spook-a-Nanny he was voiced by Daws Butler.

According to the National Park Service, it is the \\"Tallest waterfall between the Rockies and the Appalachians.\\" The waterfall is located in Hemmed-In Hollow, a small valley closed in on three sides by 200 foot (60 m) bluffs. The area can be accessed from at least three different hiking trails; Centerpoint Trailhead and Compton Trailhead along State Highway 43 north of Ponca are probably the best choices for those wanting to park and hike in. Of the two, the latter offers the most direct access. From Compton the falls are 2.5 miles (4 km) from the trailhead, and the route is usually well marked and well maintained, though the hike out of Hemmed-In-Hollow is notoriously steep and difficult. For those floating the Buffalo River, the falls are an easy half-mile trek from the river trailhead and a three-mile hike from Kyle's Landing. For most of the year the flow over Hemmed-In-Hollow Falls is subdued and during dry periods can diminish to almost nothing. As one looks upward, the water breaks into thousands of individual droplets. Wind swirling in the canyon causes the falls to continually dance about. During times of heavy rain, typically during late winter or early spring, water spills heavily off the cliff.

Early life Born in Ann Arbor, Pollack attended public schools and graduated from Ann Arbor Huron High School, where he lettered in cross country, track and wrestling. Earlier, while living in England, he attended Durham Johnston Comprehensive School in Durham. In 1988 he graduated with distinction from Stanford University with an AB in American Studies. Professional life  Pollack began his career as a journalist at The Hartford Courant, and later spent several years in Spain as a foreign correspondent, freelancing for American media and eventually going to work for the Associated Press in its Madrid bureau. On his return to the United States, he went to work on the U.S. Senate campaign of his mother, Lana Pollack, and later for the Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village. Eventually, he moved to Washington, DC where he became a speechwriter for the Democratic Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives, David E.

He led the XIV Motorized Corps (after 21 June 1941, XIV Panzer Corps) from its creation in 1938 until 14 September 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad.Notes on dates related to XIV Motorized/Panzer Corps from Samuel W. Mitcham, The Panzer Legions: A Guide to the German Army Tank Divisions of World War II and Their Commanders (Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000), 263. World War I and inter-war period Born in Breslau in 1884, Wietersheim attended a Kadettenanstalt (an institute for military cadets) and began his military career in 1902.John Wingate and Leo Kessler, on p. 69 of their book, Betrayal at Venlo: The Secret Story of Appeasement and Treachery, 1939‚Äì1945 (London: L. Cooper, 1991), refer to Wietersheim as an \\"aristocratic Prussian officer.\\" From 1903 until the end of World War I, Wietersheim continued to serve in the army and was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd Class. After the war, Wietersheim had two simultaneous General Staff assignments as a captain in the staff of the 3rd Division, and also the general staff of the XXV Reserve Corps.See Wietersheim's bio, from Wolf Keiling's Die Generale des Heeres (1983), p. 370 (in German): He was promoted to major and was made an Abteilungsleiter, or department manager, at the Reich Defense Ministry (Reichswehrministerium), the governmental organ that determined the overarching policy of the Reichswehr in relation to the Weimar Republic.Wietershiem's bio from Die Generale des Heeres says, \\"Anschlie√üend diente er als Major und Abteilungsleiter im Reichs- Kriegsministerium [Subsequently, Wietersheim served as a major and department manager in the Reichs-Kriegsministerium],\\" which is a misleading comment, as this body was not called the Reichskriegsministerium until it was reorganized out of the Weimar's/Reichswehr's Reichwehrministerium upon the formation of the Wehrmacht in 1935; further, Wietersheim's rank of major only lasted until 1930. He did however continue to serve in the ministry until 1936, after the transition and his promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1930. During the early 1930s, Wietersheim served as the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division and continued his work with the Defense Ministry. He was promoted to Oberst (colonel) in November 1932 and to Generalmajor (major general) in July 1934. When the Defense Ministry was reorganized as the War Ministry (Reichskriegministerium) under Adolf Hitler, chancellor of Germany and dictator since 1933, in 1935 to match Hitler's simultaneous dissolution of the Reichswehr and creation of the greatly expanded, war-oriented Wehrmacht, Wietersheim was made the Oberquartiermeister I (O. Qu. I) of the General Staff. This position, \\"immediately subordinated to the Chief of the General Staff,\\" entailed the control of several departments of General Staff, \\"carrying command of the operations, transport and supply sections.\\"Taylor, 101. As the General Staff was put on a war footing, this high-level logistics command was a \\"key position,\\" and Wietersheim, \\"a brilliant Generalmajor\\", held this role from March 1935 until later-Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, at that time junior to Wietersheim, took over for him in October 1936. During this time, Wietersheim had been promoted to Generalleutnant, and, after handing over his post as O. Qu. I to Manstein, he took over command of the 29th Infantry Division on 1 October 1936 his first real position outside the internal command structure of the General Staff. On 1 February 1938, Wietersheim was promoted to General der Infanterie, and was given command of XIV Motorised Corps, later renamed to XIV Panzer Corps, on 1 April 1938, upon the formation of this unit. On 10 August 1938, Wietersheim had been called to the Berghof, Hitler's Bavarian retreat, along with a group of other high- ranking Wehrmacht chiefs of staff in order that Hitler could attempt to persuade them that invading Czechoslovakia was a good plan of action. Most of the generals were not convinced by Hitler's arguments, but Generals Jodl and Manstein later commented that Wietersheim, who was the highest-ranking officer in attendance (and the Chief of Staff of General Wilhelm Adam's Second Army Group, which was in charge of any potential Western FrontJames P. Duffy, Vincent L. Ricci, Target Hitler: The Plots to Kill Adolf Hitler (Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1992), 52-53.), was the only one present to argue with Hitler directly about the faults in his plan, namely that an invasion of Czechoslovakia would leave the West Wall along the German-French border weak and in risk of being overrun within a few weeks should a French force decide to attack.William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1960), 369-370. Jodl reported in his diary that Hitler \\"became furious\\" and yelled at Wietersheim: \\"I say to you Herr General...[the West Wall] will be held not only for three weeks but for three years!\\"Qtd. in Shirer, 370. World War II Wietersheim's XIV Motorised Corps participated in the Invasion of Poland in 1939, where it fought in the Battle of Radom and the Siege of Warsaw, as well as in the Battle of Kock. The corps later took part in the Battle of France in 1940 as the Wehrmacht drove from the Ardennes to the English Channel. In June 1941, the unit under Wietersheim participated in Operation Barbarossa, where, as part of the First Panzer Group, it served with Army Group South on the southern sector of the eastern front, advancing via Lvov, Tarnopol and Zhitomir to Kremenchug and Mirgorod, and south to Marfinskaya in the Mius sector. The corps spearheaded First Panzer Group's difficult and impressive drive to Kiev during the Battle of Kiev (1941), and participated in the Battle of Rostov (1941). Early in the Battle of Stalingrad, Wietersheim used his tanks to protect the advance from the Don River to the Volga, which was criticized for being an inappropriate use of an armored formation. Soon after, having encountered exceptionally strong resistance from Red Army troops, he suggested a partial withdrawal to the Don, due to high casualties among his troops in the salient north of Stalingrad, just to the west of the Volga. Deemed acts of incompetence and defeatism, he was relieved of command by the head of the German Sixth Army, Friedrich Paulus, and subsequently dismissed by Hitler. Historian Alan Clark reported that Wietersheim returned to Germany after his dismissal, only reappearing in any military context in 1945 as a private in a Pomeranian Volkssturm unit.Alan Clark, Barbarossa: The Russian German Conflict, 1941-1945 (New York: W. Morrow), 233.  Post-war  Wietersheim, like most high-ranking German generals, gave his testimony to the post-war Nuremberg Military Tribunals, held from 1946 to 1949. The Telford Taylor Papers, held at the Diamond Law Library at Columbia University Law School, list Wietersheim as having been interrogated on 13 February 1948.Telford Taylor Papers, Diamond Law Library, ref: NMT-OCCWC: Evidence Division, Interrogation Branch - Interrogation Summary - Wietersheim, Gustav Anton von (13 February 1948), Box 4, Folder 57.

Ransohoff said, \\"I made The Cincinnati Kid 20 years ago and I was amused at the possibility of filling in a third - pool, poker and craps, they're sort of the three major areas of table gambling. This area of dice hadn't been dealt with.\\" Ransohoff admitted he was unhappy with the title of the novel. \\"We're reviewing it because people are misled. Some people think it's a sequel to The Natural. Others think it deals with druggies.

The Los Angeles Times said the film \\"is so entertaining, so true to its period that it's easy to peg it as another '50s nostalgia piece when it actually possesses the kind of complexity usually associated with less commercial, less starry productions. It is very much in the spirit that former Columbia Pictures Chairman David Puttnam said he wanted to bring to Hollywood. The film also marks a terrific screen coming of age for Matt Dillon, who for the first time seems more man than boy, and it is a strong directorial debut for Ben Bolt... Robert Bolt.

They are often solitary fish. Description The cocoa damselfish is an oval, laterally compressed fish and grows to about long. The top of the head and the snout bear several blue stripes. The top half of the body is generally dark blue or brown and the bottom half is yellow. The sides are finely barred with vertical dark lines. There are two small black spots, one above the pectoral fins and the other on the top of the caudal peduncle. The large dorsal fin has 12 spines and 14 to 17 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 12 to 15 soft rays. The caudal fin is shallowly forked and has rounded lobes.Stegastes variabilis on FishBase Juveniles have a number of tiny blue spots and stripes on the head and upper part of the body, including two spots and a stripe on the upper iris. These regions also have a dusky blue sheen. A blue-rimmed black eyespot is located where the dorsal fin spines join with the soft rays. A similar blue-rimmed spot is found at the top of the caudle peduncle, and it extends down nearly as far as the lateral line. Older juveniles develop the characteristic blue and yellow coloration of the adult.Pomacentridae: Stegastes variabilis Larvae of coral reef fishes. Retrieved 2011-12-28.  Distribution  Cocoa damselfish are found in the western Atlantic by Brazil and the Caribbean. The populations from Brazil and the Caribbean are genetically very distinct. They are also found in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. They are marine and reef-associated. They do not migrate and have a depth range of 0 to 30 m. It is common on offshore reefs, oil platforms, and wrecks. The juveniles can occasionally appear inshore. Ecology Adults feed mainly on benthic algae but also on sponges, ascidiacea and anemones, while juveniles feed on invertebrates such as harpacticoid copepods and nemerteans. Individual Stegastes variabilis don't overlap territories with other damselfish. They appear to survive longer in captivity, up to 18 years, whereas they do not live beyond 12 years in the wild. Breeding In the breeding season, the female lays eggs on the seabed where they are attached to empty shells, stones or other objects and fertilized by the male. He then guards them, aerates them and chases away intruders. The males do this for seven days. They are aggressive when breeding. Also there is distinct pairing during breeding.

It is located just north of the You Yangs, near the town of Little River. The fenced 420-hectare site protects a large number of threatened species. It contains native carnivorous marsupials such as the eastern and spotted-tail quoll, the critically endangered southern brush-tailed rock wallaby, and the mainland's largest population of the now extinct (outside of our fences) eastern barred bandicoots. History The facility, originally called the \\"Little River Earth Sanctuary\\", was established by Earth Sanctuaries Limited, a publicly listed company founded by John Wamsley and his partner Proo Geddes, with conservation as its core role. The company bought a number of properties in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria to advance Wamsley's idea of creating fully protected habitats for Australian native flora and fauna. Earth Sanctuaries purchased the 1185-hectare Mount Rothwell property from the Chirnside family in March 2000, due to the presence of a 170-hectare remnant of old-growth grassy woodland. Long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots, rufous bettongs, red-bellied pademelons, eastern quolls and brush-tailed phascogales were reintroduced into their former habitat. The sanctuary opened to the public on 7 September 2002. Earth Sanctuaries listed on the stock exchange in 2000, but Wamsley's dream of combining business with conservation quickly ran into financial difficulties. In 2002, Earth Sanctuaries was forced to sell seven of its properties, and in 2005 the company was bought by a private Victorian conservation company, ES Link, for 14 cents a share. The north-west and south-east areas of the original Mount Rothwell holding were sold, as was the historic bluestone homestead. In November 2006, Prudentia Investments bought ES Link. Prudentia said it regarded the property as an investment in nature and said it would continue to research and breed native animals and native grasslands. The facility was renamed the Mount Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre.

The term AM/FM/GIS mostly refers to GIS software that allows utility users to digitize, manage and analyze their utility network data. This data is stored in an underlying GIS database which also maintains the associations between the graphical entities and the attributes.  Components  There are mainly two major components of any AM/FM/GIS system, the graphical component and the database component. .  Graphical component  The graphical component, as the term suggests, deals with graphical data which can consist of different types of real world entities or objects represented graphically by shapes or geometries. For example, a street or road can be graphically represented by a linear geometry or a line. Other types of graphical objects can be individual symbols representing single location point objects like road markers. Areas are often represented by polygons especially for objects like boundaries. The system allows the user to configure different geometry styles for different type of real world objects. There are tools available within the system to digitize or create the graphical objects.  Database component  The database component, as the term suggests, mainly deals with the database part which stores the attribute data for the real world entities that need to be captured or managed as a part of the digitization process. This attribute data is often stored in an underlying relational database. A database table often represents a single real world entity or object and will be used to store relevant attribute data. The database component is often linked or associated with the graphical component to complete an intelligent GIS system.  Architecture  An AM/FM/GIS system's architecture depends solely on the requirements defined by a public utility. These requirements are mostly industry standards and seldom require changes. A good AM/FM/GIS system evolves with the industry changes that may take place from time to time. In order to accommodate these changes, the software is equipped with data model tools and rule base change mechanism that allow system architects to customize the system if needed and make it more intelligent. The AM/FM/GIS system data model allow GIS architects to define a relationship model which consists of all the database tables and their dependencies. This is often combined with business rules to make the system more intelligent so that it can be utilized in running various analysis on the data. E.g. a gas pipeline GIS system can let the users perform detailed analysis of all the pressure points or valves located on the pipe at different intervals. This can be possible by defining a relationship between a pipeline entity or object and the pressure valve object. Designing a data model for any utility company could be an extensive task which involves requirements gathering and analysis, designing specifications and implementation. Implementation mostly deals with development of functional tools to assist users in managing and analyzing the system. These functional tools might include object placement tools, analysis tools, reporting tools etc. The functional tool development is generally done using a supporting programming language. An advanced AM/FM/GIS software is always equipped with pre-defined functions and procedures to carry out common GIS operations.  Advantages  GIS technology has given many organizations a chance to stow away the clumsy torn maps and go digital. A complete AM/FM/GIS tool not only provides digital maps but also numerous time-saving and cost cutting tools. The public utility companies have changed significantly in the past decade. With increasing demand, there is tremendous pressure on the utility companies to improve their business. Companies have been looking at information systems to re-organize their business processes and benefit from it. Some AM/FM/GIS systems offer full-fledged solutions to companies by supporting their existing business processes. Some of these solutions are - * Utilizing an existing GIS system. * Supporting Workflow Management Systems (WMS) * Integration with Customer Information Systems * Integration with Operations Support Systems (OSS) * Integration with Planning and Engineering * Cost analysis * Inventory Management Investing in AM/FM/GIS systems with good planning can help businesses benefit in the long run.

It was created using Adobe Flash. The show was initially marketed as a children's show, but in later advertising and in press kits issued to the media, it was clearly indicated that the show included a more adult tone and themes. The show's 10PM broadcast time further illustrated that its target was an adult audience. It was the fourth adult animated series produced by Disney, the other three being The PJs, which aired on Fox, Clerks: The Animated Series, which aired on ABC, and Clone High, which was a co-production of MTV and Teletoon, and is the only adult animated show from Disney to not be produced at Touchstone Television, now known as ABC Signature. Slacker Cats was animated by Film Roman, the same company that animates The Simpsons and King of the Hill and produced by Laika. It features the voice talents of comedians Harland Williams and Sinbad in the lead roles. It was created by Andy Riley and Kevin Cecil, who also served as executive producers along with animation director Seth Kearsley, who designed the characters. Slacker Cats was canceled on September 17, 2007 after six episodes. A second season premiered on the ABC Family website on January 19, 2009, and was released on iTunes and Xbox Live Marketplace. The second season was numbered as a continuation of the first season, episodes 7 through 12. Plot Slacker Cats is about two cats and their quotidian, strange and outrageous adventures. The animation style is similar to contemporary cartoons such as Family Guy. Main plots of the show revolve around Buckley and Eddie's schemes to escape the everyday monotony of being house cats by taking advantage of humans (as well as other cats) to freewheel themselves in the fictional city of Wendell, California. Cast and characters Buckley and Eddie. Buckley One of the two main protagonists of Slacker Cats, along with Eddie. He is a cat owned by Louise, living in her apartment. He is clever by cat standards, but he thinks he is much more clever than he really is, which causes he and Eddie to encounter a lot of trouble. He secretly wants to be human, feeling life is limited as a cat. His best friend is Eddie, who is often the cause of his mishaps. Buckley is also the constant nemesis of Mrs. Boots for reasons that remain unknown. He is in love with his owner Louise and plans on marrying her, but she doesn't return his feelings. Despite his unreturned feelings he still addresses her as if she were his girlfriend. Buckley's personality fluctuates from laziness and uncaring to being remotely active and feeling guilty. He is notably more ethical than Eddie. Buckley also shows an aggressive side, attacking his friend Tabitha and removing her remaining ear, though it was later reattached. Voiced by Harland Williams. Eddie One of the two main protagonists of Slacker Cats, along with Buckley. He, like most other characters, is a cat. His owner is Dan, who looks surprisingly like him. Eddie is Buckley's best friend, though he rarely acts like it. He's extremely egotistical about himself, even to the point of kissing a dummy replica of himself (seen in episode 6.) Eddie often speaks of his way with lady cats and past events that involve numerous lady cats at one time, although there is no evidence of this. However, he's stated by other characters to be more of a \\"tough alley cat\\" than a normal Californian house cat, hinting Eddie could actually be somewhat of a ladies man. Yet at the same time is also shown to be very desperate, including going far out of his way and hurting himself/friends to get attention from female cats. He knows Buckley is in love with his owner, Louise, and often makes fun of him for it, calling him a \\"sicko\\" or an \\"Ownerphile\\" whenever he looks at something human related. However, he will still stand up for Buckley, normally against Mrs. Boots asking \\"Where is Mr. Boots?\\" which causes her run off angrily every time. Voiced by Sinbad. Tabitha She is cat whose owner is unknown and may be a stray because of her neglected appearance. However, in episode 5 she admits to have once have had an owner but since then had forgotten who it was. She has one ear, which has a bow on it and the other seems to have been mostly bitten off. She is also often shown carrying a small green purse. She is not too bright, but she is cheery and believes she is everyone's friend. Of all the people in Wendell, she enjoys spending time with Buckley and Eddie, much to their annoyance. Whenever she sees them and tries to talk she is given an excuse by Eddie why they are too busy or tells her to wait somewhere for them, often somewhere dangerous. She is willing to forgive anything, including being left in the middle of a highway or having her ear ripped off by Buckley. She often shows characteristics of bipolar disorder, going from cheery to standing over Louise (whom she duck-taped to her bed) with a scalpel and directions on how to perform a \\"reverse conjoined twin separation\\" on her. Voiced by Kiersten Warren. Dooper Dooper is a stray cat that lives in a cardboard box in an alley near Louise's apartment. He is afraid of almost everything and is quite nervous. As a result of this he is constantly coming up with outlandish conspiracy theories and rushes to warn everyone. The closest things to friends he has are Buckley and Eddie, whom he normally tells his theories to first. They usually ignore him, but sometimes use his conspiracy theories to trick him into doing their dirty work. He will often find small, everyday things like a crack in the pavement and use it as proof of his theories. Also it is said that Dooper doesn't have any testicles, suggesting that he once had an owner who had him neutered. Voiced by Emo Philips. Mrs. Boots She is a cat whose owner is unknown but her owner's family is shown to be wealthy as she lives in a mansion. She is Buckley's nemesis and tries to thwart his plans in any way she can. The reason why she hates Buckley remains unknown. Her name derives from the difference in color of her body and her paws. She is all light grey except for her paws which are dark brown. She is very self- conscious about them, calling them \\"deformities\\" and hiding them in her fur when she sits. She is also self-conscious about her name, always becoming aggravated when Eddie asks \\"Where's Mr. Boots?\\". She shows herself as a classy cat, but has a short temper and when angry starts to yell and her voice becomes a little bit hoarse. Voiced by Niecy Nash. Louise She is one of the only main human characters and is Buckley's owner. Technically their relationship can be viewed as somewhat closer as humans can understand cats and vice versa on the show, but she still treats him as her pet for the most part. Buckley has a romantic infatuation with Louise and hopes to one day consummate their relationship, although she is oblivious to the fact. Buckley even said that he once proposed to her. Voiced by Nicole Sullivan. Ingrid and Latoyah Best friends who Eddie thinks are hot. Ingrid and Latoyah are voiced by Masasa Moyo and Alex Borstein. Series overview Episodes Season 1 (2007) Season 2 (2009)  Production  The original 2001 pilot was animated in claymation by Laika's predecessor Will Vinton Studios. The series was pitched to The WB who turned it down. The pilot has a different artstyle from the final version. It also had a different voice cast except for Tabitha.

The species in this genus are typically called bush-hens. A monotypic subtribe, Amaurornithina, was proposed for this genus. Systematics The genus Amaurornis was erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853 with the plain bush-hen (Amaurornis olivacea) as the type species. The name comes from the Greek amauros, meaning \\"dusky\\" or \\"brown\\" and ornis, meaning \\"bird\\". The New Guinea flightless rail was sometimes included in this genus, but more often held to constitute a distinct monotypic genus Megacrex. The first cladistic studies of rails, based on morphology, strongly suggested that Amaurornis as traditionally defined is not monophyletic, and that several species placed here are in fact closer to the small crakes traditionally placed in Porzana. This was subsequently confirmed by molecular data. However, these smallish species are probably not close to the large members of Porzana either, and would warrant re-establishment of the old genus Zapornia.

It lives primarily in the forests, mangroves, and swamps of Central and South America. Of the two subspecies, A. c. avicenniae is found in southeastern Brazil, while the nominate is found throughout the portion of the range not occupied by the other subspecies. The species as a whole is usually found at elevations from sea level to , although some have been found above that. This bird's large extent of occurrence along with its population is why it is considered to be least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In some places, it is occasionally hunted and kept for food. This bird, large for a wood rail, has both a grey head and neck. In the nominate, the back of the head has a brown patch. The are olive-green to dark brown. The chest and flanks are a rufous colour, with the belly, rump, and tail being black. The legs are coral-red, the bill is a bright greenish-yellow, and the eyes are red. The sexes are similar. The juveniles can be differentiated by their duller look, and the chicks have a black, downy appearance, brown head, and black beak. The subspecies avicenniae can be differentiated by its smaller size, lack of a brown patch at the back of the neck, and its lower back being toned slightly olive. The are also pale. A monogamous bird, pairs can be found together throughout the year. During the breeding season, which usually lasts from March to August, the grey-cowled wood rail builds nests that can be found on flat branches and in thickets, usually at heights between . In these nests, there is a clutch consisting of three to seven eggs, incubated by both sexes. The chicks that hatch are precocial, able to move soon after hatching. This rail feeds on a wide range of foods, from molluscs to seeds. It is also known to feed on the feces of giant otters. Taxonomy and etymology Placed in the family Rallidae‚Äîthe rails‚Äîthis species was originally described as Fulica Cajanea by Philipp Ludwig Statius M√ºller, in his 1776 Vollst√§ndiges Natursystem. M√ºller based his description on the illustration ‚ÄúPoule d‚ÄôEau de Cayenne‚Äù (Cayenne's water hen) by French naturalist and artist Edme-Louis Daubenton in his Planches Enlumine√©s d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle. It was eventually moved to the new genus Aramides, the wood rails, by Jacques Pucheran in 1845, and the specific epithet was changed to cajaneus. The grey-cowled wood rail is regarded as being sister species with the russet-naped wood rail, one of the nine members of the genus Aramides, of which the grey-cowled wood rail is included in. The two were classified as subspecies of a single species by James L. Peters in the 1934 edition of his Check-list of Birds of the World, before being separated as species once more in 2015. The two rails have different calls and plumage with no gradation reported. The number of subspecies is contentious, some authorities recognize up to nine, while others recognize only two. It is even suggested that the subspecies avicenniae be split off as a full species, based on differences in morphology and calls, speculated to have arisen because the slaty-breasted wood rail acted as an ecological barrier between the two subspecies. The subspecies, according to the International Ornithologists' Union, are: * Aramides cajaneus cajaneus (M√ºller, 1776) ‚Äî from Costa Rica to Colombia, east through Venezuela and Trinidad to Brazil, and south to Northern Argentina and Uruguay * A. c. avicenniae Stotz, 1992 ‚Äî coastal southeastern Brazil Etymology The genus name of the grey-cowled wood rail‚ÄîAramides‚Äîis derived from the combination of the genus name Aramus and of the Greek oidƒìs, \\"resembling\\". This refers to the similarity between birds of the genus Aramides and the one species of the genus Aramus. The specific epithet, cajaneus, is in reference to the capital city of French Guiana, Cayenne. The subspecies epithet avicenniae honours the Persian philosopher Avicenna. Description The grey-cowled wood rail usually measures long and weighs , particularly large for a wood rail. The are olive-green to dark brown. The head and neck are medium-grey, blending into a brown patch at the back of the head. The eyes are red. The chest and flanks are rufous. The belly, rump, and tail are black. The legs are coral-red, while the bill is a bright greenish-yellow. The males and females are similar. Juvenile birds are similar to the adult but are duller in colour, with their belly sooty-black and flecked with buff. The juveniles also differ in that their bill and legs are dusky, and have brownish eyes. The chicks are black and downy, with a brownish head. Their dark eyes are lined with dull, reddish bare skin. The black bill has a flesh-coloured base, and a small, white behind the tip of the , as well as a very small one at the tip of the . The subspecies avicenniae differs from the nominate by its smaller size. It also varies as its nape to back is a dull grey colour. The brown spot present at the back of the head of the nominate is also reduced or gone. The lower back is toned a slight olive, and the underparts are also slightly paler than the nominate, but without white feathers. Avicenniae's upper wing-coverts are also more greenish-grey. The similar but smaller rufous-necked wood rail can be differentiated from the grey-necked wood rail by the former's reddish head and neck with a grey upper back. This bird its simultaneously. This moult occurs during the months from March to June. Vocalizations The grey-cowled wood rail has a loud, repetitive cackling call mainly heard at dawn and dusk: pop- tiyi pop-tiyi co-co-co-co-co or chitico chitico cao-cao-cao. These songs are often sung in a chorus or duet. The is a harsh, loud cackle or clucking shriek. The chitico chitico cao-cao-cao call made by this rail is similar to the brown wood rail's kui-ko call. Distribution and habitat alt=A grey- cowled wood rail on the left side, looking at the camera. The grey-cowled wood rail is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The nominate subspecies is cut off by the Andes Mountains and lives east of the range in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; it is not found in the southeastern interior of Brazil. The subspecies avicenniae is found in coastal southeastern Brazil, around S√£o Paulo. The grey-cowled wood rail's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and subtropical or tropical swamps. The subspecies avicenniae, however, is almost completely restricted to mangrove forests. The grey-cowled wood rail can be found from sea level to elevations around , although some wanderers have been recorded at elevations up to in Colombia. Behaviour and ecology A grey-necked wood rail feeding on seeds This bird can be seen to perch in both shrubbery and even trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-cowled wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally move to a branch close to the ground. If it is being observed, it is generally cautious. Breeding The grey-cowled wood rail's nests are situated in trees and bushes, usually 1 to 3 metres (3.3 to 9.8 ft) off the ground, built on flat branches or in thickets and lined with twigs and leaves. They generally have a diameter between on the outside, with an internal diameter of around . The depth is usually between under . The overall height of the nest is around . This bird is monogamous, forming long lasting pair bonds, with pairs of grey- necked wood rails staying together throughout the year. Its breeding season usually occurs between March and August, although this varies depending on geography. In Costa Rica, the breeding season extends until September. In Mexico, on the other hand, the breeding season is known to start as early as January. In captivity, this wood rail is territorial. The clutch the grey- cowled wood rail lays usually consists of three to seven brown-blotched, slightly glossy, whitish eggs, although clutches consisting of five eggs are most typical. These eggs usually measure around and weigh between . They are incubated by both sexes, each taking six to eight hour shifts, for around 20 days. In captivity, the male incubates during the day, and the female during the night. The chicks hatch precocial and are cared for by the parents for one or two days before leaving the nest, although chicks sometimes use the brood nest until they are 40 days old. Feeding A wading grey-necked wood rail This bird feeds at night, eating various invertebrates and small vertebrates. While in mangroves, it commonly feeds on crabs. Otherwise, it will generally feed on molluscs, arthropods, frogs, seeds, berries, palm fruits, and the occasional water snake. Maize, rice, and bananas are also viable food items for the grey-necked wood rail. It is also known to feed on the feces of giant otters at latrines. When eating snails, this rail will hammer at the shells to extract them. For berries, it will jump high to break off clusters of this fruit. After doing this, it will pick off the berries one by one and eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks. Parasites The grey- cowled wood rail is the type host of Plasmodium bertii, an apicomplexan parasite, meaning that P. bertii was originally discovered on this organism. P. lutzi is also found on this bird. Status This rail is considered to be a least-concern species, according to the IUCN. The justification is this species' stable and large population, believed to be somewhere between five million and 50 million individuals. The grey-cowled wood rail also has a large extent of occurrence, estimated to cover . It is common throughout its range, although it is adversely affected by destruction of its habitat. Human interaction The grey-cowled wood rail is occasionally hunted for food in northeast Brazil. They are usually hunted with baited fish hooks that are laid near the bodies of water where these birds forage. In the Las Minas District, in Panama, this bird is also kept for food. Although it is generally cautious, it can tolerate an approach by humans up to about away from it, after which it will retreat into the undergrowth.

It is part of the large-bodied genus, Ardeotis, and, though little known, appears to be a fairly typical species in that group.  Description  As in all bustards, the male Arabian bustard is much larger than the female. Males have been found to weigh , while females weigh . The record-sized male Arabian bustard weighed . These birds stand from tall in females to tall in males.Dunning, John B., Jr. (ed.) CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses. CRC Press (1992), . They are fairly similar in overall appearance to the kori bustard, with a brown body, gray neck and white underside, but are noticeably smaller, with a more elegant, slender build. They are also differ in having white checkered covert pattern at the end of the folded wing, as opposed to various black-and-white patterns as seen in other large African bustards.Stevenson, Terry and Fanshawe, John (2001). Field Guide to the Birds of East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi. Elsevier Science, Habits The Arabian bustard is usually solitary or lives in pairs and family parties. Small flocks have been observed migrating north into the Sahel zone, to breed during the rainy season before returning south when the dry season begins. However the population in Morocco was considered sedentary, as is the population in the Arabian Peninsula. On these movements the Arabian bustard has been known to migrate with Denham's bustards. The clutch size of Arabian bustards is one to two eggs, laid in a shallow scrape on the ground. The females have sole responsibility for incubation of the eggs and rearing the young. When the brood is threatened, the females has been observed to demonstrate diversionary behaviour, e.g. calling, refusing to flee, to distract potential predators from chicks. Arabian bustards are reported to catch and eat locusts, grasshoppers, beetles, reptiles, and small mammals. They have also been recorded feeding on the seeds and fruits of shrubs, such as Cordia sinensis, Grewia villosa, Salvadora persica and wild melon Citrullus as well as \\"Acacia\\" gum. Habitat Semi desert and arid grassy plains, also \\"Acacia\\" woodlands. Distribution It is found in Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Iraq, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It is a vagrant to Kenya, Gambia, northern Ivory Coast and northern Ghana. Conservation Due to its wide range, it was not considered vulnerable by IUCN, although there is believed to have been a strong decrease in the population. In 2012 the species was uplisted to Near Threatened. The primary cause of the decrease appears to be heavy hunting pressure, with habitat degradation and destruction also playing a major role.

It was endemic to Chatham, Mangere and Pitt Islands, in the Chatham archipelago of New Zealand.Marchant and Higgins (1993) Auckland Museum Illustration from 1907 The Chatham rail and the Dieffenbach's rail, both flightless, were sympatric on the Chatham Islands. Their sympatry suggests parallel evolution after separate colonisation of the Chatham Islands by a common volant ancestor. A genetic analysis from 1997 suggested that the two were sister taxa.Trewick SA. 1997. Flightlessness and phylogeny amongst endemic rails (Aves: Rallidae) of the New Zealand region. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. 352:429‚Äì446. However more recent genetic analysis finds them to not be closely related within the Gallirallus radition, with a 2014 analysis finding the Chatham rail being sister taxon to the New Caledonian rail instead. The Chatham rail was first discovered on Mangere in 1871, and 26 specimens collected there are known from museum collections. It became extinct on the island between 1896 and 1900. The species is also known from 19th century bones from Chatham and Pitt Islands. It is likely to have occurred in scrubland and tussock grass. Taxidermied chick collected in 1872 Extinction Its extinction was presumably caused by predation by rats and cats (which were introduced in the 1890s), habitat destruction to provide sheep pasture (which destroyed all the island's bush and tussock grass by 1900), and from grazing by goats and rabbits. On Chatham and Pitt Islands, OlsonOlson (1975c) has suggested that its extinction resulted from competition with the larger Dieffenbach's rail (also extinct), but this has been refuted later when the two species have been shown to have been sympatric on Mangere.Tennyson and Millener (1994) File:MA I264486 TePapa Cabalus-modestus- Hutton full.jpg File:MA I264487 TePapa Cabalus-modestus-Hutton full.jpg File:MA I359976 TePapa Cabalus-modestus-Hutton full.jpgLateral view File:MA I359977 TePapa Cabalus-modestus-Hutton full.jpgDorsal view File:MA I359978 TePapa Cabalus-modestus-Hutton full.jpgVentral view File:MA I359979 TePapa Cabalus-modestus-Hutton full.jpgOblique view References External links * *Specimens from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. *Specimens from the Auckland War Memorial Museum TƒÅmaki Paenga Hira Category:Cabalus Category:Bird extinctions since 1500 Category:Extinct birds of New Zealand Category:Birds described in 1872 Category:Extinct birds of Oceania Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Chatham rail"},{"id":"12434115","text":"Cabalus is a genus of birds in the family Rallidae.

Behaviour The black-legged seriema is similar to its relative, the red-legged seriema, Cariama cristata. However, the black-legged seriema is more arboreal than its cousin, and it prefers to spend more time in trees. They often live together in family groups, and hunt prey together. Hunting and diet Seriemas are omnivorous. In the wild, they prey on rodents, birds, insects, and reptiles, such as lizards and snakes. They supplement this diet with some plant material, too. They have a large, curved, and hyperextensible claw on the second digit of each hind foot. This claw resembles that of the ancient troodontidae dinosaurs, such as Stenonychosaurus. If a piece of food is too large to be swallowed whole, the seriema will cut it apart with the sickle-claw. This claw is also used to kill prey, and climb trees. Relationship with humans Farmers in South America often capture young seriemas from the wild, and tame them. They are then trained to guard the farm against potential predators, such as foxes. Seriemas are very fierce, and they have been known to attack humans, especially when defending their young.

This small bustard is found in southwestern South Africa, from Namaqualand, south to Cape Town and east to Makhanda. It prefers semi-arid habitats such as grasslands, shrublands and savannas where it can easily prey on ground-dwelling arthropods and eat seeds. It reproduces yearly in the spring and will lay about one or two eggs per breeding season. Numbers have declined rapidly as much of its habitat has been converted to agricultural land and remaining tracts are often fragmented. Due to this habitat destruction, the species is considered vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.  Taxonomy  The southern black korhaan was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Otis afra. Formerly known as Eupodotis afra, it is now classified as Afrotis afra. They belong to the bustard family, Otididae. It was previously thought that the southern black korhaan and the northern black korhaan were the same species (the northern black korhaan being a sub-species, E. afra afroaoides). They are now classified as different species due to their disjunct ranges and habitats, and differences in plumage, vocalizations and social systems. They also have differences in their mitochondrial DNA. \\"Southern black korhaan\\" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).  Description  The southern black korhaan is a ground-dwelling bird with some sexual dimorphism. The male's main body plumage is of a checkered black and white with a black underbelly and neck. It also displays some white on the underwings, on the cheeks and in stripes over the eyes. The female, in contrast, has the whole of her head, neck and breast the same colour as her body, which is checkered brown and white. Both the female and the male have bright yellow legs. The male is slightly larger than the female. The male has a wingspan of 27 cm (10.6 in) to 28 cm (11.0 in) and the female a wingspan of 25 cm (9.8 in) to 26 cm (10.2 in). The tail is about 12 cm (4.7 in) to 13 cm (5.1 in) long. The male's bill is larger with a length of 3.8 cm to 3.9 cm (1.5 in), while the female's is about 3.5 cm (1.4 in) long. The bill is of a reddish colour with a black tip. Lifespan averages 10 years.  Distribution and habitat  The southern black korhaan is endemic to southwestern South Africa, ranging from Namaqualand, south to Cape Town, and east to Makhanda. It occupies about . It prefers open, semi-arid habitats such as shrub-lands and savannahs where it can easily prey on grass-dwelling arthropods, also grasslands adjoining marshland.  Behavior   Vocalization  Vocalization has been described as a \\"continuous cackling sound\\". It is mostly the male that calls, as it vocalizes very often and very loudly. The call is a raucous \\"knock-me-down, knock-me-down\\".  Breeding  The southern black korhaan is a polygynous species, which means males mate with multiple females. To attract females, males will display high flying. They breed in the spring. Females lays one or two eggs in a depression in the soil and covers them with strands of grass. The eggs are of an olive or brown colour with some dark black spots. Only the females provide parental care as they take care of the eggs and then raise the chicks.  Diet  Southern black korhaan (Afrotis afra) - male This is an omnivorous species. Two-thirds of its diet is made up of arthropods, and it will eat termites, beetles, grasshoppers and ants. The rest of its diet is composed of plant matter, mostly seeds. It partakes in a mutualistic relationship with Acacia cyclops, a species of Acacia; the southern black korhaan benefits from the seeds as they are a readily available food source, and in return, disperses the seeds to good germination sites. The southern black korhaan will also ingest grit and other small rocks to help in digestion by assisting the grinding process in the gizzard. A study has also shown that two thirds of birds have nematode parasites in their intestinal tract.  Status and conservation  Recent studies have shown that the southern black korhaan's population has been decreasing lately, which has raised concerns about its conservation status. The species was once very common but it is now becoming rarer as its habitat is being fragmented. Hence, it has been deemed vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of threatened species since October 1, 2016. The primary threat to these species is the conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural lands as well as aquaculture. This has caused habitat fragmentation and a reduction in available food sources. This reduction in habitat also means less suitable breeding grounds, which has not only affected breeding success, but chick and egg survival rates. Indeed, agricultural lands do not provide sufficient plant cover to protect them from predators such as the Pied Crow. Other threats include climate change, human disturbance and diseases.

It is widely distributed across Southern Africa. Its habitat is primarily open grassland and scrub. Taxonomy The northern black korhaan was first described in 1831 by the Scottish surgeon, explorer and zoologist Andrew Smith, who gave it the specific name \\"afraoides\\". He placed it in the genus Eupodotis, where it was one of two species, the other being the southern black korhaan (Eupodotis afra). In 1993, Dowsett and Forbes-Watson listed it as a sub-species of E. afra, while Sibley and Monroe (1990 and 1993) retained it as a separate species. Then in 2014, del Hoyo and Collar transferred both species to the genus Afrotis. Description The male's plumage has regularly- arranged black and white barring on the back and wings, the head, neck and underparts being black. The female has the head, neck, breast and upper parts barred or chequered in black and buff, the belly being black. The primary feathers are largely white, which distinguishes this species from the southern black korhaan where they are black. Both the female and the male have red beaks and bright yellow legs. Distribution and habitat The northern black korhaan is found in Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and northern South Africa. Its habitat is grassland, with vegetation up to a metre high, grassy dunes, semi- arid scrubland and open veldt. Ecology The northern black korhaan is a mainly ground-dwelling bird, but it does sometimes burst into flight when disturbed, the male emitting a loud, raucous \\"kraark, kraark\\" call. The male will often run away from an intruder with head and neck extended, before freezing, becoming surprisingly difficult to observe in the process. The female is less conspicuous and is seldom seen. The birds forage while walking along, feeding on and chasing after insects such as termites, ants, grasshoppers and beetles, as well as spiders, ticks and seeds. Breeding takes place at any time of year. The male has a courtship display involving dipping flights, flaring white feathers and the ritual chasing of other birds. He displays to several females but is territorial, and drives away other males. The nest is a scrape on the ground containing one or two eggs. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being of \\"least concern\\".

Its call is a series of frog-like croaks, usually uttered in flight. Its natural habitat is plateau grassland, dry shrubland, arable land and pastureland. Its preferred habitat is one with short grassland and flat topography. Description Southern Free State, South Africa Korhaans are ground-dwelling birds with sturdy bodies, large heads and long necks, long legs and short toes. The blue korhaan is a fairly large bird growing to a total length of . The forehead and crown are black, while the sides of the head are white. In males, the back, wings and tail are brown but the neck, throat, breast and belly are bluish-grey. Females are similar in colouring but the neck and underparts are a duller grey and the ear coverts are buff. The legs and feet are yellow. The voice is a series of throaty \\"krok-kau\\"s, often heard around dawn and uttered during flight. Distribution and habitat The blue korhaan is native to South Africa and the western fringes of Lesotho. Its range extends from Pretoria and Mbombela southwards to Bhisho and amounts to an area of around . It is found on grassland at altitudes of between . It favours short grass habitats, with a scattering of karoo-type dwarf shrubs, and with termite mounds but few trees, usually within a kilometre of water. It also occurs in previously cultivated and fallow areas, and in winter crops and pasture. Ecology This bird is largely terrestrial; when disturbed it crouches down, and on being approached tends to walk or run away with head dipped. It will flush when alarmed however, flying for a considerable distance. It usually occurs in pairs or in small family groups, and forages for insects, lizards, scorpions, seeds, flowers and leaves. Breeding mainly takes place in October and November. The nest is a scoop on the ground, often in thick foliage, where one to three eggs are laid. Incubation takes about 26 days, and the family may stay together for two years. Status The population of this species was estimated to be between 8,000 and 10,000 mature birds in 2017 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In the Eastern Karoo the population seems to be declining but elsewhere it seems fairly stable. However, according to the IUCN, the area of suitable habitat is being reduced due to grassland being converted for agricultural use, and this is expected to continue. For this reason, the IUCN has assessed the bird's conservation status as being \\"near threatened\\".

League had been a licensed pilot, and licensed engine and aircraft mechanic. He had barnstormed around in Missouri and Illinois with his \\"flying circus,\\" prior to St. Louis hiring him as the first U.S. air traffic controller in 1929. He was stationed at the airfield in St. Louis, Missouri (now known as Lambert-St. Louis International Airport). Before the installation of a radio tower, he was a flagman who directed traffic via flags. His first \\"control tower\\" consisted of a wheelbarrow on which he mounted a beach umbrella for the summer heat. In it he carried a beach chair, his lunch, water, a notepad and a pair of signal flags to direct the aircraft. He used a checkered flag to indicate to the pilot \\"GO\\", i.e. proceed, or a red flag to indicate the pilot should \\"HOLD\\" their position. He kept warm out on the field in the winters by wearing a padded flying suit. When a radio tower was installed in the early 1930s, he became the airport's first radio controller. League went on to earn a degree in aeronautical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. League joined the Federal service in 1937 at the Bureau of Air Commerce (the precursor to the Civil Aeronautics Authority, and the Federal Aviation Administration). He rose rapidly through the ranks as an air traffic controller, served as a pilot in World War II (where he rose to the rank of colonel) then progressed to his first top management position in 1956, as Assistant Regional Administrator of the Central Region. He next went to Washington headquarters as Chief of the Planning Division (Planning and Development Office) in 1958. After a short assignment as Director, Bureau of National Capital Airports, he moved to Fort Worth as the Director of Southwest Region. His next assignment was in May 1965, relocating to Washington headquarters as Director of Air Traffic Services, where he became head of the staff responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the nation‚Äôs air traffic control system. He eventually became FAA's Air Traffic Service director and retired as an Assistant Administrator for Appraisal in 1973. During his 36-year career he helped develop the federal air traffic control system. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) named the Archie League Medal of Safety Awards after him. He was born in 1907 at Poplar Bluff, Missouri, in Butler County. He died on October 1, 1986, at the age of 79 in Annandale, Virginia.

The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the German physician and ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub.  Description  At 60 cm, they are larger than the similar Black- bellied bustard (Lissotis melanogaster ) but more grey and more clearly marked in face, and the lower back with blackish tail. They have a small head set on a long neck, and a bulky body with large legs. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but with a cream-coloured head and hind neck with dark brown markings, a whitish belly and paler tail .  Breeding  The breed usually in rainy periods however it depends on the geography of the place . In Ethiopia, Hartlaub's bustard breed in April and in eats Africa. they breed around January to June. however the aerial display of breeding is recorded in November.

Found in Ethiopia and Somalia, its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland. As indicated by its name, this bustard is the world's smallest at 45 cm (18 in) and 600 grams (1.3 lb). It is threatened by habitat destruction. Description The smallest species in its genus, the little brown bustard reaches a maximum length of about . They are light brown birds with whitish underparts. The male has a black tuft on the nape, and a black throat speckled with white. The female lacks these black areas, instead having heavy buff spotting on the back, wings and breast. Both male and female have dark flight feathers on the wings, and when flying show a slender white wing-bar, which divides the black feathers from the sandy-brown wing coverts. The female white-bellied bustard (Eupodotis senegalensis), which has a wider range, is larger and darker and has bluish-grey colouring on the back of the neck. The call of the little brown bustard is uttered with the neck outstretched and the head thrown back and is a high-pitched, rattling sound. Distribution and habitat The little brown bustard is endemic to the Horn of Africa, where its range includes southern and eastern Ethiopia and northern and central Somalia. Its typical habitat is dry scrub and open thornbush, and it sometimes moves out onto tussocky plains. It occurs at altitudes of up to . Ecology Bustards are ground dwelling birds, walking briskly on sturdy legs, foraging as they go. They are able to fly but seem to prefer running and walking. The diet of the little brown bustard consists of seeds, buds, insects and small vertebrates such as lizards. The breeding season is from April to August; two eggs (occasionally three) are laid on the ground and incubated by the female. Status The total population of this bird is unknown, but its range coincides with an area where war was being waged in the 1970s and 1980s when there was a marked decline in its population. There have also been droughts in the area and disturbances caused by the establishment of refugee camps, hunting, cultivation, and the gathering of firewood so it is likely that some local populations have been eliminated. Although still fairly common in some areas, the general population trend is downwards, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird's conservation status as \\"near threatened\\".

The juvenile is duller and darker, with a dark grey crown and buff spots on the wing. The neck and rump patterns of both sexes, the male's white chin and lores, and the female's vermiculations are points that distinguish this species from its close relative, Hartlaub's bustard. Range and habitat It is found in woodland(Savana), cultivated fields and tall open grassland in Sub-Saharan Africa. This species is also found in the areas of S. Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and some areas of Tanzania and Nigeria. It prefers higher rainfall than Hartlaub's bustard and in many areas occurs only following heavy rain. Behaviour In feeding habits it resembles other bustards. In courtship display the male retracts his head to his back, giving \\"a short rising wheezy whistle, zhweeeeee\\", pauses in that position, and slowly raises his head, giving \\"a popping quock or plop followed by soft gurgling\\". Diet This is an omnivorous bird mainly feeding on invertebrates like beetles, grasshopper, cockroach, ants and some other small insects. Their diet also includes some vegetables, fruits like berries, flowers, seeds and green leaves.

It is one of Namibia's 13 native birds found in the western part of the country. On overage they inhabit areas with low rainfall such as deserts, plains, and savannahs. Where their exceptionally senses play a major role in their security. It is most likely found in Namibrand nature reserve, Mirabib, Ganab in the Namib- Naukluft Park, Bloedkoppie, and in the Spitzkoppe surroundings. R√ºppell's Korhaan are usually monogamous but sometimes breed in large family groups. It lays eggs all year round with a peak season from February to May. Nest are made among rocks and stone with some occasional plant coverage. It can lay 1-3 eggs at a time that are incubated solely by the female. R√ºppell's Korhaan are omnivorous, having a diet of mostly invertebrates such as small reptiles and termites and they also eat leaves and seeds. Eating is usually done by pecking the ground as they walk. Bustards are highly susceptible to the loss or modification of habitat, nearly always as a result of increasing pressures from agriculture, hunting, poaching for sport and food, and disturbances especially during breading season. As a result of their elusiveness, natural shyness, large home ranges, combined with their camouflage have made them one the most difficult groups to obtain any sufficient biological, population, or mortality data on. The conservation of these animals is almost entirely the responsibility of Namibia.

When males attract females, the feathers of their vertex rise to form a crest and those of the throat and neck swell. The females and the immatures have brown rather than gray head feathers. Habitat The red-crested korhaan inhabits diverse environments: dry savanna, bushveld, thorny scrubland, but sometimes also wet woodland. It is a sedentary rather than migratory bird. Reproduction The male attracts females by flying high into the air and dropping down. Nests are placed on the ground sheltered by grass or bush. The brood comprises two eggs colored from olive-brown to pink-beige with dark brown spots. Chicks are leaving the nest within a few days of hatching to follow the mother. Emancipation occurs after four to five weeks of breeding, but the young remain with their mother for several more months.

While most coots have a horny shield on the forehead, the horned coot has three wattles in both sexes. The central wattle is large and may possibly be erectile. The three wattles terminate in tufts of filoplumes. At the base of the beak and below the wattle is a fleshy caruncle which is whitish. The bill is olive yellow, brightening to dull orange towards the base. Unlike the giant coot, the legs of the horned coot are dull greenish. Breeding Lake with two nests in the water close to the shoreline The horned coot is monogamous, and sometimes breeds in colonies of up to 80 pairs. The huge nest is typically located about 40 metres from the shore in the waters of the high altitude lakes where it breeds. Pebbles are piled by the birds to form an artificial island that reaches the water surface. This island is then covered with algae to form the nest. It has been estimated that the pebble mounds may weigh as much as 1.5 tons and they are refurbished in each season. They breed from November to January.Ripley, S.

Elliott, A. and Sargatal, J (1996) Handbook of the Birds of the World‚ÄîHoatzins to Auks Vol 3 Lynx Edicions Barcelona It is almost flightless and has very short wings and tail. The bill is large and bright red with a whitish tip. The long, strong legs are red as are the iris and eye-ring. The upperparts are olive-brown while the underparts are black with narrow white bars. The face is black with a white spot between the bill and eye and a white line behind the eye, extending back to the side of the neck. The undertail-coverts are dark brown with pale bars. Juvenile birds are paler than the adults and are mottled white below rather than barred. The spot in front of the eye is tinged with brown while the stripe behind is shorter than in the adult. The bill and iris are brownish and the legs and feet are yellow-ochre. It is a noisy bird with a variety of loud calls. It calls most often early and late in the day, usually from the ground but sometimes from trees. Pairs often call together and up to 12 birds have been heard in one area. Distribution and habitat It is found only in Yanbaru, the northern part of Okinawa Island in the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan, from where it gets its Japanese name. It has a total range of just 260 km2. It occurs from sea-level to the highest mountains at 498 m above sea-level. In winter, some birds move lower down or move a little further south of the breeding range. It mainly occurs in evergreen broad-leaved forest but also occurs in marshes, grassland and cultivated land close to forested areas and water. Itaji (Castanopsis sieboldii) is the dominant tree in the rail's habitat but it also occurs among other trees such as Ryukyu Pine (Pinus luchuensis). It requires dense ground vegetation as well as standing water for bathing. Behavior It is a poor flyer but it can run rapidly. It spends most of its time on the ground but usually roosts in trees, climbing up to sleep on a branch or sloping trunk. In the morning, it preens and stretches before dropping straight to the ground. It is usually found in dense cover but comes into the open to bathe. It bathes for short bouts of 2‚Äì4 minutes before preening for 4‚Äì20 minutes. It feeds on lizards, amphibians, snails and large insects such as locusts. Food is mainly taken from the forest floor but may also be taken from shallow water. Pairs are monogamous and appear to mate for life. The nest is built on the ground and made of leaves, grass and fern fronds. The eggs are laid between May and July and there are 2‚Äì4 in a clutch. The eggs are oval in shape and white with reddish, pinkish or brownish markings concentrated at the larger end. The downy young are black with yellowish legs and feet and a white bill with a blackish base and tip. The eggs and young are often predated by the habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis), a venomous snake. Status and conservation The species is classified as endangered by BirdLife International because of its small, declining population and restricted range. The total population was estimated at 1,800 birds in 1986. Surveys between 1996 and 2004 suggested a significant decline to about 720 birds and a northward contraction of the range of about 40%. However, a survey in 2006 found no further range contraction.BirdLife International (2008) Species factsheet: Gallirallus okinawae. Downloaded on 15 October 2008. It is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat due to logging, agriculture and the building of roads, dams and golf courses. Introduced predators such as cats, dogs and the small Asian mongoose probably have an impact while some birds are killed by vehicles on roads. The species is legally protected in Japan and has been declared a \\"Natural Monument\\" and a \\"Special Bird for Protection\\". Yanbaru became a national park in 1996 and several forest sites have been bought by conservation organizations as nature reserves. Trapping is taking place to reduce predator numbers and traffic calming has been introduced to some areas to reduce the number of birds killed on roads. A captive breeding program is planned for the future. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment has laid out a 10-year action plan with steps it plans to take to stabilize the species numbers.

Redland City Council manages environmental pests throughout the Redlands to minimize their impact on native ecosystems and birds such as Lewin's rail. Habits Lewin's rail is a highly secretive bird. This species prefers permanent, fresh-to-saline wetlands surrounded by dense vegetation. That means it can be found in artificial wetlands surrounded by dense vegetation. Lewin's rails breed over the summer period, laying three to five eggs in their saucer- shaped ground nests, which they build from dry vegetation such as reeds and grasses.‚ÄúLewin's Rail.‚Äù Baidubaike, baike.baidu.com/item/Âç¢Ê∞èÁßßÈ∏°/6451697?fr=aladdin. The nests usually sit just above the water's edge in dense reeds and grassland. These birds forage in shallow water around the water's edge, under the cover of surrounding vegetation and aquatic plants. Lewin's rails feed mainly on invertebrates and occasionally bird eggs and frogs.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and subtropical or tropical swamps. It is threatened by habitat loss. Systematics and evolution M. inepta is indeed closely related to Amaurornis, but not as close as to warrant inclusion therein.

In addition to being the founder of the first prenatal clinic in the United States, he was the first to advocate a municipal department for the pasteurization of milk.Current Biography 1940, p344 After his appointment in 1896 as the Director of the Board of Health in Rochester, New York, Goler set about to reduce infant mortality. Following the efforts of New York City merchant Nathan Straus, who had provided pasteurized milk at cost to residents of tenements, Goler organized a station for the purification and distribution of milk.Albert Joseph Kennedy and, Robert Archey Woods, The Settlement horizon: A National Estimate (Russell Sage Foundation, 1922) During the months of July and August 1897, when infant deaths were at their highest, Goler arranged for an Infants' Milk Depot to be set up in a storefront in Rochester, with two nurses to pasteurize and cool milk, then to sell it at cost to mothers of small children. A pamphlet entitled \\"How to Take Care of Babies\\" was published in four languages and distributed for free. Infant mortality was reduced by 50 percent, and the city established four depots the following summer. In 1900, Goler set about to increase the cleanliness of raw milk, with strict hygienic standards at a particular dairy farm. Infant mortality declined further, and the standards were expanded to cover all dairy farms. Farmers were educated on hygiene, and inspection was increased. While the bacteria count in unsanitary stations was as high as 100,000 per cubic centimeter, the average for Rochester by 1907 was 3,853.

Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . It lives largely on large insects (mainly locusts), as well as flowers and seeds. Although it lives in semi-arid areas it seems to shift locally to follow the presence of rainfall. During extreme concentrations of rainfall, as many as 230 Ludwig's bustards have been seen at once feeding on locusts.Dean & Milton (editors), The Karoo: Ecological Patterns and Processes. Cambridge University Press (1999), This little-known species is now considered endangered. It is thought to be the bird species in Southern Africa most seriously at risk of dying from collisions with power lines (2011)., with collisions more likely during winter and in wetter areas, with high variability in collision rates between years.

Due to the sometimes graphic subject matter, such music was often banned from radio and only available on a jukebox. The style was most popular in the years before World War II, although it had a revival in the 1960s. Many songs used innuendo, slang terms, or double entendres, such as Lil Johnson's \\"Press My Button (Ring My Bell)\\" (\\"Come on baby, let's have some fun / Just put your hot dog in my bun\\"). However, some were very explicit. The most extreme examples were rarely recorded at all, Lucille Bogan's obscene song \\"Shave 'Em Dry\\" (1935) being a rare example. It was noted by one music historian as \\"by far the most explicit blues song preserved at a commercial pre-war recording session\\".Elijah Wald, The Dozens: A History of Rap's Mama, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 60. The more noteworthy musicians who utilised the style included Bo Carter, Bull Moose Jackson, Harlem Hamfats, Wynonie Harris, and Hank Ballard and The Midnighters.

He attempted to use a sledgehammer to bring down the statue of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad. Biography Kadhem Sharif was born in 1952 and like his father became obsessed with motorcycles. \\"I was 12 when I sneaked out on my father's Harley for the first time. I bought my first one eight years later, a 1966 Fatboy,\\" Sharif recalls. As he grew up he also developed a passion for wrestling and weightlifting, becoming a world-class athlete. Many of his sporting adventures held danger and he remembers that every time the Iraqi team did badly the leader of Iraqi sports, Saddam's son Uday Hussein, would order that everyone have their heads and eyebrows shaved and on at least one occasion, they were put in prison. Sharif's association did not end there as Uday had Sharif build him a world-class gym. Sharif also developed a weightlifting program for Uday. Sharif supplied some supplements but Uday instead started abusing steroids Uday took up collecting motorcycles like Sharif, even stealing some from him. It was at this point that they had a falling out and Sharif refused to fix any of Uday's bikes. It was then that he was thrown in jail on trumped up charges and spent two years in Iraqi prisons. Firdos Square On April 9, 2003 Sharif had his chance to take revenge. Hearing that the Saddam regime had fallen he took a 10 kg (22 lb) sledgehammer and went to work on the statue of Saddam Hussein that stood in Firdos Square in Baghdad. The square is directly in front of the Palestine Hotel where the world's journalists had been staying. Seeing a crowd and a story, the reporters and their cameras streamed out of the hotel and video taped the falling of Saddam Hussein's statue. While Sharif's actions with the sledgehammer only resulted in a small dent in the statue base and bloody hands, he does claim to have handed over the Iraqi flag that was placed on the statue. After the fall The legality of Sharif's motorcycle business and collection has always been murky and he has admitted that some of his bikes were stolen in neighboring countries and smuggled into Iraq along with dealing with the bikes looted from Kuwait when Saddam Hussein invaded the country. His business finally caught up with him when in 2005 he was arrested in connection with dealing stolen bikes. In a 2016 interview Kadhem said that he expressed his regret over his role in the Firdos Square statue destruction in which he attacked the statue with a sledgehammer. He said \\"Saddam has gone, but now in his place we have a 1,000 Saddam's.\\" and \\"When I go past that statue, I feel pain and shame. I ask myself, why did I topple this statue. I'd like to put it back up, to rebuild it. I'd put it back up but I'm afraid I would be killed.\\" He looked back to Saddam's time with nostalgia as \\"Saddam never executed people without a reason. He was as solid as a wall. There was no corruption or looting, it was safe. You could be safe.\\" He went on to say that he hopes the two leaders viewed as responsible for the overthrow of Saddam, Tony Blair and George Bush, should be brought to justice. Bike collection Kadhem had been a bike collector almost all his life but after the war his collection greatly expanded until he was arrested. In his collection there were a number of notable bike including: *1914 - This Norton was part of the escort of King Faisal, Iraq's first monarch. *1947 - British-made BSA that he found rusting in a farm in \\"Anbar province\\", an area of western Iraq notorious for insurgent violence since the 2003 US-led invasion. *1957 British Norton motorcycle that Saddam Hussein the revolutionary rode when on the run after the assassination of then Iraqi President Abd al-Karim Qasim half a century ago. *1957 Rolls- Royce Silver Cloud, formerly the property of the Emir of Kuwait. *Saddam's eldest son, Uday Hussein, became an invalid after he was seriously injured in a 1996 assassination attempt. Uday, also a collector of bikes, had his collection made into three-wheelers so he could still drive them. After Saddam's fall Kadhem was able to get his hands on all of Uday's monster three- wheeled invalid motorcycles.

This is a medium-large bustard found in the sparsely vegetated interface between the southern margins of the Sahara desert and the northern part of the Sahel. It is found in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan. Its natural habitats are dry savanna and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. Description In this species, males average around and measure around in length and in wingspan. Females are much smaller at around and in length and across the wings.Beaman & Madge, The Handbook of Bird Identification for Europe and the Western Palearctic. Princeton University Press (1998), It is smaller than the sympatric Arabian bustard, as well as more rufous with a different body shape. Compared to larger bustards the Nubian has a more rounded body, a relatively long, thin neck and a rounded head. Life history Observation of breeding has occurred from July to October have been reported across the species' range. Young birds and eggs are threatened by a wider range of predators, including mammalian carnivores and reptiles. Conservation Classified as Near-Threatened by the IUCN, its main threat is habitat loss.

It is monotypic within the genus Ortyxelos. Description The quail-plover is a small, short-tailed cursorial bird which looks a little like a miniature courser when on the ground. The upperparts are a sandy-rufous colour and the underparts mainly whitish. They show a distinctive wing pattern in flight when the contrast between the white primary coverts and the black with white-tipped remiges to form a distinct diagonal band on the upperwing. Its fluttering flight style is rather lark-like. The females are slightly darker than the males while the juveniles are paler. Habits and habitat The quail-plover is usually found singly or in pairs in dry grassland and thorn scrub. It is rather skulking preferring to move stealthily through grass but also running around like a courser in the open. Tends to crouch down and hide when approached and flushes only when the observer is almost on top of it and then flies off with a jerky undulating flight. It breeds during the dry season and moves north ahead of the rains It tends to be more active at night and to call with a soft low whistle like the wind going through a pipe during moonlit nights. Distribution The Sahel from southern Mauritania and northern Senegal eastwards to northern Cameroon and southern Chad into South Sudan and southern Sudan with separate population in northern Benin and coastal Ghana, with another in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. Conservation status The quail- plover has an extremely large range, its population trend is not known, the population is not understood to be undergoing a sufficiently rapid decline to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion while the population size has not been quantified so the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. History A La Madeleine restaurant in Duluth, Georgia La Madeleine Country French Caf√© was founded in February 1983 by Patrick Esquerr√©, a Loire Valley-born businessman. With the advice and support of legendary retail magnate Stanley Marcus, of Neiman Marcus fame, and his mother, Monique Esquerr√©, opened his first bakery on Mockingbird Lane in Dallas, Texas near Southern Methodist University and it soon expanded to a caf√©. In 1998, Esquerr√© resigned and La Madeleine was sold to four investment companies. In 2001, the company was sold again to Groupe Le Duff, a French restaurant chain company owned by Louis Le Duff, and co- purchasers Lapointe Rosenstein and Cadigan Investment Partners, for an undisclosed amount. In 2008, the company caused outrage after discontinuing the free side of bread after 20 years due to wheat costs, and started charging 49 cents. In addition, the restaurants only offered sourdough bread with certain items that were purchased such as entr√©es, soups, and salads. However, the discontinuation was recalled three days later with the suggestion that customers not waste the food after La Madeleine allegedly received a \\"couple hundred responses...mostly complaints\\". Food is served cafeteria style for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The buildings are designed to resemble restaurants found across the French countryside. Farm tools and impressionist paintings hang on the walls, and the restaurants are known for keeping a fire burning in winter. However, in March 2010, at the Preston Rd/Forest Ln location in Dallas, the cafeteria style was dropped for a modern ordering station system. In a news article regarding this, Esquerr√© called his resignation a regret and announced he was joining La Madeleine again as an ambassador/adviser, claiming he was even \\"going to be in the dishwashing room\\". That same year, La Madeleine's Belt Line Rd location in Dallas was named \\"Best Soup in Dallas\\" by Dallas Observer. Esquerr√© has commented that he dislikes the term \\"chain,\\" and has repeatedly referred to his restaurants as a family. The original store is still in existence, at 3072 Mockingbird Lane, Dallas, Texas, despite major reconstruction of the surrounding area by SMU. The chain was named a winner of the Great Dallas Business Ethics Award in 2018 by the North Texas Ethics Association. Current President is Philippe Jean, French former CEO of the Del Arte brand, another sister company inside Le Duff Group in France. Philippe Jean has been with Le Duff for more than 7 years. He has been in the industry for 30 years in companies such as Sodexo, Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs, Elior Areas or Groupe Flo.

Description Adult As an adult the spotless crake can reach a length of 17 ‚Äì 20 cm; a wingspan of 26 ‚Äì 29 cm; and can weigh between 40 ‚Äì 50g. The head, and neck of the spotless crake is a bluish‚Äìgrey slate colour. Some also have an occasional light grey or whitish patch on the chin, which can extend down the throat. The back, the outer wings, and inner wings have a dark reddish‚Äìbrown which then fades into a dark blackish ‚Äì brown on the tail feathers. The underside of the spotless crake is also a bluish‚Äìgrey which then transitions to a blackish‚Äìgrey on the underside of the tail feathers. Its bill is black, and its eyes are a deep red which contrast sharply with the head. The legs and feet are a reddish‚Äìpink colour. Spotless crake lack any obvious sexual dimorphism, making it hard to distinguish between male and female. . Juvenile The juvenile spotless crake is similar to the adult, but its colouring is duller over the whole body, and is paler and browner than the mature crake. Its chin and throat have a white patch on it. The back is a dull brown, and the head and underside is a dull grey‚Äìbrown. The eyes are a brownish-orange which then begin to turn red as it matures. The colour of the legs and feet can vary from an olive‚Äìbrown, brownish‚Äìgrey, or a brownish‚Äìflesh colour which also turn red as it matures. Voice The spotless crake has a variety of calls, although little is known about the meaning of each. Originally, seven separate calls of the spotless crake were detected, including a bubbling sound, a sharp, high pitched ‚Äòpit-pit‚Äô, a ‚Äòmook‚Äô sound which varies in loudness and pitch, and a loud ‚Äòpurring‚Äô call. The high-pitched ‚Äòpurr‚Äô sound is believed to be its song. This call is made up of a rapid series of notes which are roughly 25 per second, making it its loudest call. More calls were detected at the time but since then only four have been described. Eggs The colour of spotless crake eggs are a ‚Äòdull creamy brown or pinkish with faint chestnut flecks‚Äô. Distribution and habitat Natural global range The spotless crake naturally occurs in many countries throughout the south pacific. These countries include: ‚ÄòPhilippines, Moluccas, New Guinea, Melanesia, Australia, Tasmania, Norfolk Island, and south-west Polynesia including New Zealand‚Äô, as well as Indonesia. New Zealand range In New Zealand, the spotless crake, also known as p≈´weto, is distributed throughout the mainland. Numbers are few in the South Island with only a handful of isolated communities on the west coast, east coast, and Southland, New Zealand. The distribution in the North Island is spread far wider, but there are still few communities. Most sightings of spotless crake tend to be near the top of the North Island. Nationally important sites include: Awarua-Waituna wetland complex in Southland, New Zealand, Great Barrier Island, Kermadec Islands, Lake Wairarapa, Poor Knights Islands, Tiritiri Matangi Island, and Whangamarino wetland in Waikato. Other than the mainland the spotless crake has been found on many offshore islands including: ‚ÄòKermadec Islands, Manawat√§whi/ Three Kings Island, Poor Knights Island, and the Chatham Islands‚Äô. Fossils of the spotless crake from the Holocene period have also been found on the mainland, as well as the Chatham Islands. Because the spotless crake is rarely seen, it is hard to determine what the population size is, so currently population numbers are unknown in New Zealand. It is believed that the reason spotless crake are rarely found in the South Island, New Zealand is due to the more dominant rail the marsh crake pushing the spotless crake out of suitable habitat, as the natural habitat of the two species are very similar. Another reason may be that they are not as tolerant of the colder climate due to them being more common in high altitude wetlands. Habitat preferences Spotless crakes are freshwater wetland birds. Their preferred habitat is wetland and swamp areas that contain dense vegetation in which to build their nests from. They can be found foraging on open muddy areas near dense vegetation, but when disturbed they retreat back into the vegetation. On some small offshore islands, where wetlands are sparse, they have been known to live and forage in dry forest. Although raupo tends to be the preferred habitat for spotless crake, they have also been found in swamp areas composed of flax (Phormium tenax), tussock sedge (Carex secta), and cabbage tree (Cordyline australis). If habitat is not ideal, they are also able to migrate locally, which other subspecies do elsewhere. Life Cycle/Phenology Length of time to reach maturity When the chicks hatch, they stay in the nest for up to four days, and have the ability to catch live prey from three days old. Chicks are then reared by both the male and female for 4 ‚Äì 5 months. Description of mating Determining the sexual behaviour of spotless crake is difficult due to their shy nature and dense vegetation which restricts observations. Kaufmann observed the mating of spotless crakes at Pukepuke Lagoon where the make and female circled a patch of tussock sedge (C. secta) then stood on it. The female arched her body with the bill facing down. The male then mounted, while balancing with outstretched wings. Intromission only lasted a few seconds. Description of egg laying Time of year and length of incubation Eggs in a nest, Southwest Australia, 1913 Spotless crake nests are made up of interwoven grasses within patches of tussock sedge and raupo. They usually breed in large, dense, and tall stands of reeds, rushes, sedges, and grass tussocks. Their nests are found between 30 ‚Äì 50 cm above the water, and are found to be in close proximity to other nest-like platforms. Eggs are laid from late August to the end of January, with a clutch size of between 2 and 5 eggs. Both the male and female incubate the eggs for between 20 ‚Äì 22 days. It is believed there is evidence to suggest that clutch size increases as the season progresses; from 3 egg clutches in August and September to 5 egg clutches in December. Hadden found the same pattern in clutch size. Diet and Predators Diet Spotless crake are omnivorous. Their diet consists of seeds, fruits, shoots of grasses, leaves of aquatic plants, adult and larval insects, mollusks, crustaceans, spiders, carrion, worms, beetles, and other insects. Predators Due to the introduction of mammalian predators, the spotless crake is vulnerable to predation. Predators include cats, dogs, mustelids, and rats. The major predator threat appear to be cats. Parents may feign injury to distract predators if they are present. Other Threats Other threats to spotless crake are the clearance of habitat, such as swamp draining and clearing for agriculture which mainly took place when Europeans arrived.

Genetic evidence suggests the closest relative of ochroptera is the grey-winged trumpeter, leading some to treat it as a separate species, the ochre-winged trumpeter (P. ochroptera).Ribas, Aleixo, Nogueira, Miyaki and Cracraft. 2011. A palaeobiogeographic model for biotic diversification within Amazonia over the past three million years. Proceedings of the Royal Society The reproductive behavior of the nominate subspecies of the pale-winged trumpeter is the best known of all the trumpeters'. Groups of adults defend a territory together. Several males mate with the dominant female, the dominant male doing so most often. She lays an average of three eggs in a hole in a tree, where both males and females incubate. The young hatch covered with thick, dark, cryptically patterned down. Soon afterwards, they jump down to the ground and follow the adults. Their call is a loud staccato trumpeting.

It is endemic to the Andaman Islands of the eastern Indian Ocean. Taxonomy and systematics It was first described as the Andaman banded crake Euryzona canningi by Blyth in the 1863 issue of the journal, Ibis. Later, it was treated as Andamaneese banded crake Rallina canningi by Baker in 1929. Subsequently, Ripley and Ali retained Baker's scientific name for the species, while reverting to Blyth's common name. Description Andaman crake from a chromolithograph in The Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon, published in 1890 This is the largest Rallina, measuring about 34 cm in length. It has a glossy chestnut plumage, extensive bold barring on underparts, unbarred undertail-coverts, relatively bright apple-green bill and relatively long and fluffy tail; legs and feet are olive-green. It also has pale barring on wings confined to outer primaries and greater and medium coverts. Juveniles are duller and less prominently barred.BLI (2008) Other similar looking crakes include other Rallina and ruddy-breasted crake Porzana fusca. They are smaller and do not have green bill and legs. Immature birds are duller overall with the barred areas being dark grey-brown with a chestnut tinge, narrowly banded and streaked dirty white. Juvenile birds are paler than adult. Voice is a deep croak. It utters a sharp click as an alarm call. Distribution and habitat Its natural habitat is marshland inside subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. It is known from North, Middle and South Andaman islands and may occur on other islands such as Great Coco or middle Coco Islands. It was formerly classified as data deficient by the IUCN, due to the lack of reliable information on its status.BLI (2004) Later studies showed it to be fairly common in suitable habitat. Consequently, it has been listed at least concern status in 2017. BirdLife International estimates the population to range between 10,000 and 25,000 individuals. Behaviour and ecology Breeding It breeds between June and August. It nests at the bottom of large trees with buttresses or under tangled undergrowth in forests. In one study, the species preferred trees such as Terminalia, Tetrameles nudiflora or Pterocarpus, possibly near waterbodies. Its eggs are similar to those of the banded crake but larger, whiter and more glossy. Both sexes share in incubation. According to Baker, the eggs are about 40 by 30 mm. Food and feeding Much like other crakes, it feeds on small fish, molluscs, worms and insects (beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars). Large grasshoppers shaken about and battered before swallowing. Threats to survival In the 1980s, the crake was considered to be quite common on the islands; over 80 birds were snared in a square mile. It is much rare now even though there are extensive forests in the islands. Introduced predators may also pose a risk to the birds' population.

She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the Niobrara River in Nebraska. The ship was laid down on 29 June 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Sparrows Point, Maryland, as a type T3-S-A1 tanker named SS Citadel, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 520). Launched on 28 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Mark O'Dea, she was acquired by the Navy and commissioned as USS Niobrara on 13 March 1943, Comdr. Theodore G. Haff in command. Service history World War II, 1943-1945 Shakedown and fueling-at-sea training completed, Niobrara sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 April 1943 to carry oil to Argentia, Newfoundland, then ferried oil from ports in Texas and Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, to Mediterranean ports to support operations in the invasions of North Africa and Sicily. In March 1944 she was altered at Norfolk for Pacific service, and sailed for the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, and Kwajalein where she fueled transports bound for the Marianas invasions begun in June 1944. Niobrara served as station tanker at Eniwetok until July, then operated from that base fueling ships at sea, thus enabling carrier task forces to roam the western Pacific and the Philippine Sea without interrupting their strikes to return to port. On 1 October she arrived in Kossol Roads, Palaus, to serve as station tanker for smaller combatants patrolling during the assault and occupation of the Palaus, then for forces preparing for the return to the Philippines. On 8 January 1945, she herself proceeded to Leyte, then into the South China Sea to fuel task force TF 38, then attacking the China coast. During the next two months, she served at Ulithi and Saipan fueling ships for the Iwo Jima invasion and preparing for the Okinawa campaign. She sailed 26 March from Ulithi for Okinawa, and after refueling 5th Fleet striking units at sea, closed Hagushi Beach on 5 April to fuel radar picket destroyers. Air and submarine alerts, as well as gunfire close ashore, required expert seamanship to refuel ships alongside while maneuvering to protect the ship. She continued to support ships patrolling off Okinawa and carrier striking forces until the end of the war. Post-war activities, 1945-1946 Niobrara entered Tokyo Bay on 30 August to witness the surrender, and after three months' occupation duty, sailed for Guam, where she aided in salvage work. On 10 December she sailed for the Panama Canal and the east coast, along which she operated until decommissioning on 24 September 1946. Atlantic Fleet, 1951-1954 She lay in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until recommissioning on 5 February 1951 for three years' service with the Atlantic Fleet along the east coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Mediterranean. On 13 June 1954 she arrived in San Diego, California, to join the Pacific Fleet's operations until decommissioning on 30 November 1954. Pacific Fleet, 1956-1957 She recommissioned at San Francisco, California, on 14 December 1956 and again served in the Pacific Fleet until sailing to Galveston, Texas, where she decommissioned on 12 November 1957. In reserve and disposal She transferred to the Maritime Administration on 5 December 1957 and joined the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Beaumont, Texas. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1959, and disposed of by MARAD (Trade-in-exchange) on 22 March 1982, and then scrapped in Germany.

It is also known as the red-tailed flufftail. The species is closely related to the Madagascar flufftail. The species has a disjunct distribution across the Afromontane of southeastern Africa, with two subspecies. The nominate subspecies S. a. affinis is found in eastern South Africa and Swaziland. S. a. antonii, named for German ornithologist Anton Reichenow, is found in eastern Zimbabwe and Mozambique, Malawi, southern Tanzania, Kenya and the south of South Sudan.Taylor, B. & Kirwan, G.M.

(retrieved from http://www.hbw.com/node/53574 on 5 March 2017). The striped flufftail is a small rail-like birds, long. Males weight between , no information exists about the weight of females. The wingspan is . The male has a chestnut head, white throat, and black body streaked with white with a yellowish wash. The female is brown with lighter barring and a pale belly. S. a. antonii is different from the nominate in having the chestnut of the head coming down to the breast, and in being larger. The species occupies a range of habitats and altitudes, being found at sea level in South Africa and up to in Kenya. The species is mostly found in alpine grasslands, usually near water, and requires good cover with some clear ground. In South Africa, at lower altitudes, it is found in fynbos. The striped flufftail feeds on a range of insects including beetles, caterpillars, ants, termites, flies, crickets and bugs, as well as spiders and seeds. They typically feed in open ground. Breeding happens during the local rainy season. Pairs hold territories year-round, with a smaller breeding territory and a larger home range. The nest is a bowl of dry grass set in a grass tuft.

Its scientific name honours South African ornithologist Thomas Ayres, who discovered it at Potchefstroom.The once extensive Potchefstroom marshes have since been reduced to small remnants. See: Sam de Beer (2001), Nick Jonas (2004) Potchefstroom and environs Description It resembles its relatives in the flufftail genus, but both sexes have dull plumage and dark crowns. In flight both sexes also show distinctive white secondary feathers, a feature shared only with the related genus Coturnicops. Non-breeding birds call only at dawn and dusk, sometimes in duet. Their natural habitat is seasonal marshland of subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland. Distribution and habitat The species has a seemingly disjunct range, being found north of the equator in Ethiopia, and south of it in Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Historically, it was believed to breed only in Ethiopia, though in 2018, it was recorded breeding in South Africa. It is a very local, and apparently only summer, visitor to highland marshes south of the equator. It is unknown whether the northern and southern populations are distinct, but their physical features appear identical. The birds are not resident in any of the few known sites, sometimes departing after as little as six weeks when conditions turn unfavourable. The three Ethiopian sites are the Suluta Valley wetlands, the Berga wetlands and the Wersebi wetlands near Addis Ababa. The species was first found to breed at the Berga wetlands in 1997. Breeding has since been confirmed from the Wersebi wetlands and the Bilacha river wetland, close to Berga, which may be the main site. In South Africa they are regular at the Dullstroom and Wakkerstroom marshes, where public access is strictly regulated. Conservation & Status The species is severely threatened by habitat loss, causes of which include grass trampling by cattle, grass cutting and drainage of swamps for pasture. Additional threats include flooding from dams, development of housing, and erosion. Regulated land management could improve the situation markedly.

Conchoid of Nicomedes drawn by an apparatus illustrated in Eutocius' Commentaries on the works of Archimedes Nicomedes (; ; c. 280 ‚Äì c. 210 BC) was an ancient Greek mathematician.  Life and work  Almost nothing is known about Nicomedes' life apart from references in his works. Studies have stated that Nicomedes was born in about 280 BC and died in about 210 BC. It is known that he lived around the time of Eratosthenes or after, because he criticized Eratosthenes' method of doubling the cube. It is also known that Apollonius of Perga called a curve of his creation a \\"sister of the conchoid\\", suggesting that he was naming it after Nicomedes' already famous curve. Consequently, it is believed that Nicomedes lived after Eratosthenes and before Apollonius of Perga. Like many geometers of the time, Nicomedes was engaged in trying to solve the problems of doubling the cube and trisecting the angle, both problems we now understand to be impossible using the tools of classical geometry. In the course of his investigations, Nicomedes created the conchoid of Nicomedes; a discovery that is contained in his famous work entitled On conchoid lines. Nicomedes discovered three distinct types of conchoids, now unknown. Pappus wrote: \\"Nicomedes trisected any rectilinear angle by means of the conchoidal curves, the construction, order and properties of which he handed down, being himself the discoverer of their peculiar character\\". Nicomedes also used the Hippias' quadratrix to square the circle, since according to Pappus, \\"For the squaring of the circle there was used by Dinostratus, Nicomedes, and certain other later persons a certain curve which took its name from this property, for it is called by them square-forming\\".

It is found in Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and the Solomon Islands. Other names by which it is known in different parts of its range include black-backed, black-spotted and orange- breasted buttonquail. There are fourteen recognised subspecies. Description The red-backed buttonquail is a small stocky bird with round- tipped wings and a short tail. The length varies between . The female is larger than the male and weighs between to the male's . The subspecies T. m. melanotus, found in northern Australia, has a pale yellow beak, yellowish irises and yellowish legs and feet. The front and top of the head are blackish scalloped with grey, and the side of the head, the neck and throat are brownish-buff, with a reddish-brown partial collar. The upper parts are slate grey, narrowly barred with reddish-brown and black. The under-wing plumage is pale grey. The lower throat is whitish, darkening to buff on the breast and belly, the sides being boldly marked with spots and scallops. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the female is more vividly coloured with a brighter yellow beak and more distinctive chestnut collar. Juveniles have a much darker colouring. Other subspecies vary slightly from this colouring. Distribution This buttonquail is native to southeastern Asia and Oceania. Its range extends from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands and East Timor to Australia. In Australia it ranges in a coastal strip from northeastern Western Australia to Cape York and southward to northeastern New South Wales. It mostly inhabits rough, tussocky grassland, woods and cropped land. It is mostly a lowland bird but the subspecies T. m. giluwensis can be found at up over in east-central New Guinea. In Australia it is usually found near water and only occurs in areas with at least of rain in summer, and is only resident in areas with at least of precipitation. Ecology The red-backed buttonquail is mostly active at dusk and at night. It is a ground-dwelling species and moves around alone or in pairs, or in small groups of up to five birds. When disturbed it may \\"freeze\\" or run, but seldom takes to the wing, and when it does so, it does not usually travel far. Nevertheless, some populations are believed to be partially migrant, probably travelling at night; the birds' movements are poorly documented. It feeds on the seeds of grasses and sedges, other seeds, green plant matter and insects, probably consuming more insect prey than other members of the genus. Breeding takes place at some time between October and June. The nest is built in the base of a grass tussock, usually among tall grasses in a wet area. It is a scoop lined with grass, leaves and bits of dung, and often roofed with nearby grasses woven together. After the female has laid a clutch of two to four whitish eggs with dark speckles, the male takes over the incubation and is exclusively involved in the care of the young; the female is serially polyandrous, seeking out another male and repeating this breeding process. Status T. maculosus has a very wide range and, apart from southeastern Australia where it is said to be uncommon, it is a common species. The total number of birds is thought to be decreasing because suitable habitat for the bird is being degraded, but the population is not declining at a sufficiently fast rate to put the bird at risk, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \\"least concern\\".

It is endemic to Madagascar and a few small islands nearby. It is a largely ground-dwelling bird and the female is rather more brightly coloured than the male. It is the male that incubates the eggs and mainly cares for the young. Description The Madagascar buttonquail is a stocky bird with a small head and short legs and tail. Both sexes are cryptically coloured; the male has a light brown head with black and white streaking and mottling, and a greyish-brown back and wings with fine dark barring and pale-edged feathers, the barring on the outer scapulars being bolder. The tail is greyish-brown with fine barring. The chin and throat are whitish, the breast cinnamon-buff with dark barring and the belly whitish. The bill is bluish-grey, the irises white or pale grey and the legs greyish. The female is more brightly coloured. The top of the head is blackish and the mantle brownish-grey with some dark barring and cinnamon feather-edges, interspersed with some plain grey-brown feathers, giving a chequer-board effect. There is a white moustachial stripe below which the chin and upper throat form a black bib. The breast is cinnamon-pink and the belly grey with faint barring. The juvenile resembles the male but is somewhat darker and more heavily spotted. Distribution and habitat This buttonquail is endemic to the island of Madagascar and is present over most of the island in suitable habitat. It is found in grassland, open woodland, clearings, glades, the edges of forests, sandy and bushy locations, weedy places and cultivated areas, especially where cassava is grown. It has been introduced to the Seychelles and is present on R√©union, although it is unclear whether it is native there. It is also present on a few small islands between Madagascar and mainland Africa. Ecology The species is often seen alone or in small groups of up to four birds. If startled it may crouch to avoid detection, or may run away, but seldom flies unless danger is very close. Even then, it flies with rapid wingbeats for only a short distance. It forages by scratching in the plant litter like a chicken, leaving distinctive circular depressions. It mainly feeds on invertebrates and has a particular liking for termite larvae. One individual was found to have eaten snails, cockroaches, beetles, flies, bugs and caterpillars. It may also eat seeds. As with other members of this family, the female plays the more active role in the breeding season, defending a territory and making vocalisations to attract a male. The nest is built in a slight depression on the ground often concealed in a grass tussock or thick vegetation. It is built by both birds from dried grasses and stems, dead leaves and sometimes feathers. It may be partially roofed with dead leaves and sometimes is approached by a covered runway. A clutch of about four, heavily blotched eggs is laid. The male incubates these for about a fortnight, possibly being relieved by the female occasionally; he is also responsible for the care of the young, feeding them for the first week from his bill before they start to peck food from the ground. The female is at first aggressive towards the chicks and the male defends them, but later the female takes on more of a caring role. The chicks become independent by the fifth week and may be driven away by the parents after this. Status T. nigricollis is a common bird in the north, west and south of the island but is less common in the central and eastern areas. Its total area of occupancy is estimated to be about . No particular threats have been identified and the population trend is believed to be stable, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \\"least concern\\".

It is endemic to Australia. The species is generally regarded as widespread, although uncommon, in New South Wales, Queensland, northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and classified as Vulnerable in Victoria. The red-chested buttonquail is a small reddish brown, ground running bird, which avoids flying. The female is brighter and slightly larger in size and weight. The female is polyandrous, initiating courtship among several males and expelling rival females from her territory.  Taxonomy  The red-chested buttonquail was originally described by ornithologist John Gould in 1841, Aberdeen, New South Wales, Australia. It was originally named Hemipodius pyrrhothorax. The red-chested buttonquail belongs to the bird family Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to the Quail or Phasianidae. There are 17 species in the family Turnicidae, with two genera, Turnix and Ortyxelos. The red-chested buttonquail belongs to the genus Turnix. The red-chested buttonquail is usually regarded as monotypic, but recent proposal to treat T. worcesteri and T. everetti as subspecies of present species. Proposed subspecies berneyi (NW Australia) and intermedia (Queensland) are no longer recognized, because they are based on individual rather than geographical variation.  Description  Adult red-chested buttonquails are 12‚Äì16 cm long with males weighing 27-46 g and females 31-83 g. The species is smaller in size than the painted button-quail. Viewed from behind, red-chested buttonquail look uniformly pale grey across the upper- wings and back. Side-on, the rufous wash on the upper-parts of the red-chested buttonquail is obvious. From close range its thick blue-grey beak, pink legs and feet, and pale eyes can be seen. Females are brighter than males, with rufous of underparts brighter and extending over throat to sides of head, and narrower and denser barring on flanks that rarely extend onto breast as scalloping. Juveniles are smaller, darker above with white streaks and dark barring, bold white spots on wing-coverts, underparts white with rufous-brown gorget and upper breast scalloped. The red-chested buttonquail is more commonly sighted in woodland habitats, than grassland habitats. When disturbed it scuttles through the grass or flies low with whirring wings often showing its white flanks before it drops to cover. The species generally prefers to stay close to the ground and avoids flying.  Similar species  The red- chested buttonquail is most easily distinguished by its uniformed grey-brown tone on its upper side and orange chestnut flakes. While the Little buttonquail (Turnix velox) can be recognised by its distinctly reddish brown or pinkish toned under body and the contrasting tones between parts of its wings. The Red-backed buttonquail (Turnix maculosus) has a darker slate-grey or blackish tone on its upper side and has dark underparts except for a contrasting wing panel.  Distribution and habitat  Red-chested buttonquails are found along the eastern side of Australia and the top of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. They are not found in Tasmania. The species' preferred habitat is in dense grasslands, and open, grassy, woodland of Acacia (Fabaceae), River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and Black box (E. largiflorens) or Melaleuca (Myrtaceae), but also in crops and weedy fields with dense ground cover, and from coastal plains. They occur between sea level and 1000m above sea level. They are generally found in moister, denser vegetation cover than the little buttonquail, but also inhabit semi-arid zones. The common factors in their desired habitat seems to be bare ground and abundant leaf litter, little or no understorey, patches of tussock grass or sedges. The birds normally forage in open area of deep leaf litter, and retreat to the undercover of tussocks or woody debris if threatened.  Behaviour   Feeding  The red-chested buttonquail feeds on seeds (grasses, Triticum, Panicum and Malvaceae) and insects (cockroaches, ants, flies and larvae). Foraging occurs throughout the day, although the species has been said to be nocturnal and crepuscular. They make platelets while foraging, which is typical for the genus Turnix. They glean and scratch in leaf litter, while rotating on the spot by pivoting on one foot and raking with the other. Occasionally pecking at the ground, which can sometimes be detected in dry periods by the small puffs of dust they cause while making the platelets. They have been recorded feeding alone, in pairs or small groups of up to five.  Breeding  The species breeds within tussock grasslands, spinifex or Melaleuca woodland, pastures of native grass, standing crops and stubble. The red-chested buttonquails are solitary breeders and females are sequentially polyandrous. The female usually constructs the nest and it is depression lined with grass, hooked, and shelter by grass tussock. Eggs are laid in February‚ÄìJuly/September in the north, and September‚ÄìFebruary in the south. Usually four white eggs with chestnut-brown markings are laid at one- or two-day intervals. Incubation lasts 13‚Äì18 days from completion of clutch. Males incubate and care for chicks alone. Chicks leave the nest precocial and nidfugous. They are grey-brown with dark and pale dorsal stripes. They reach adult size in 6‚Äì8 weeks and adult-like plumage at 2‚Äì3 months. They reach sexual maturity at 6 months.  Vocalization and communication  The female is known to display a repetitive advertising call of ‚Äúoom‚Äù note, which increases in pitch and intensity. Disturbed birds utter a sharp chattering call. Adults are also known to communicate various soft whistles and chirrups. Juvenile birds have a weak, domestic, chicken-like call if handled. Migration Red-chested buttonquails are partial migrants. Red-chested buttonquails are known to have seasonal migration between inland arid regions to semi-arid areas nearer the coast, from winter to spring and summer. Some populations remain in one region all year round. The amount of movement is influenced by factors such as rainfall, plant growth and food availability. In captivity In captivity if the enclosure is too small the Red-chested buttonquail is known to become aggressive. Males may fight each other's offspring, while females may kill offspring of other females, so that the male will re-mate. Conservation status and threats  The red-chested buttonquail is classified as Least concern by the IUCN. It is not listed as threatened by the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, but its conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. It is listed as \\"threatened\\" by the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the red- chested buttonquail is listed as vulnerable. The red-chested buttonquail is thought to be uncommon but secure throughout the rest of its Australian range. This species was formerly hunted for food and sport, and occasionally killed by feral pests for example cats and foxes. The major threat to this species is loss of suitable habitat. This species has not adapted to crop and farmland habitats to the extent of many other Buttonquail species. Red-chested buttonquail who nest in crops have been known to lose their clutches due to harvesting. This species generally ranges from uncommon to locally common, with densities of 0¬∑2‚Äì5 birds/ha reported. In the northern parts of its distribution range the species is frequent or at least widespread, but considered to be only sparsely distributed over much of Queensland, especially in coastal areas. In the southern parts of its distribution range the species is declining or suspected to be declining. The species is very uncommon in South Australia, infrequently recorded in New South Wales (where threatened in west of state) and very few records in Victoria. The species decline in Victoria is highly due to the conversion of native grasslands to agriculture, with 95% of such habitat having been destroyed or degraded in Victoria. Grazing by livestock, crop and pasture production, and the removal of woody debris for firewood, are threatening processes for the Red-chested buttonquail. Desired habitats of the Red-chested buttonquail such as ground covers, tussock grass, sedges and woody debris, should be managed to ensure suitable habitat conditions for this species remain.

It is a cryptic species and not easy to observe and is listed as \\"Data Deficient\\" by the IUCN. It is named after American manager and zoologist Dean Conant Worcester (1866-1924). Description These birds are characterized by their black heads with white spots, a brown or fawn colored body and yellow legs on males. Females are brown with white and black spots. Distribution and habitat Worcester's buttonquail is known only from the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is a very elusive bird and is only known from a few individuals that have been taken by hunters. Its main habitat is thought to be grassland in the highlands but it is unclear whether it also inhabits forests. It has been observed to visit rice paddies and scrub lands near farm areas because of the availability of seeds and insects that they feed on regularly. It is very secretive, choosing to make small path ways through the rice fields. They are hunted by children and young men using spring traps along their usual path ways. Sighting Worcester's buttonquail was known only from drawings and descriptions until January 2009 when a local birdwatching group, the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines, took photos and recorded a video of a lone specimen at a public market in the Caraballo Mountains.

Along its route, it passes through the cities of San Antonio, Austin, and Waco before it splits into two auxiliary routes just north of Hillsboro. Interstate 35E heads northeast where it passes through Dallas. Interstate 35W turns northwest to run through Fort Worth. The two branches meet up in Denton to again form Interstate 35, where it continues to the Oklahoma border. The exit numbers for Interstate 35E maintain the sequence of exit numbers from the southern segment of Interstate 35, and the northern segment of Interstate 35 follows on from the sequence of exit numbers from Interstate 35E. Interstate 35W maintains its own sequence of exit numbers. In Texas, Interstate 35 runs for just over 407 miles (655 km), which does not include either the 85-mile (137-km) segment of Interstate 35W or the 97-mile (156-km) segment of Interstate 35E. Texas contains more miles of the overall length of Interstate 35 than any other state, almost one-third of the entire length.

I-35 continues, resplitting lanes again as it curves around the northwest corner of Downtown and turns east. It rejoins the lanes as it goes through an intersection at the northeast corner of Downtown, where I-37's northern terminus is located, while US 281 will continue on the north‚Äìsouth freeway. I-35 continues east for a few miles until it begins to curve back to the northeast. It merges with I-410 on its eastern north‚Äìsouth leg from its northbound direction in a triangular interchange and continues north concurrently from there. A few miles later, I-410 will split off onto its northern west‚Äìeast leg, while I-35 resumes its north-northeast course past the northeast corner of the city. Trucks are restricted from travel in the far left lane of I-35 in either direction throughout the San Antonio area. The restriction covers Bexar, Guadalupe, and Comal Counties.  Austin  In Austin, Interstate 35 is named Interregional Highway. Through most of the greater Austin area, I-35 is three to four lanes in each direction, dropping to three lanes north of Williamson County. It forms the eastern boundary of Downtown Austin and also passes through the eastern side of the University of Texas campus. I-35 is co-located with U.S. Highway 290 through central Austin. Trucks are restricted from travel in the far left lane of I-35 in either direction throughout the Austin area. The restriction covers Hays and Travis counties and most of Williamson county and ends north of Jarrell, Texas where I-35 is reduced to three lanes in each direction. I-35 is split into two decks between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Airport Boulevard, north of Downtown Austin. Both the upper and lower decks are signed as I-35 and US 290, and they use a common set of exit numbers, with some exit numbers duplicated between the two decks. The upper deck lanes are express lanes, with no on- or off- ramps. Drivers wishing to exit between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Airport Boulevard must use the lower deck. The I-35 corridor between San Antonio and Austin is considered one of the most congested stretches of highway in the Interstate System. Much of this traffic is due to I-35 being considered one of the primary NAFTA corridors. Efforts to alleviate the congestion include State Highway 130, which forms an I-35 bypass loop to the east of Austin. Many local and regional governance organizations have on-going studies on other methods to improve mobility on I-35, which include such features as commuter rail lines and additional managed lanes.  Waco and Central Texas  Signage for northbound I-35 motorists as the highway prepares to split near Hillsboro. In Waco, Interstate 35 is known as the Jack Kultgen Freeway. I-35 has six to eight lanes through the city of Waco. It passes just to the west of the Baylor University campus and crosses the Brazos River adjacent to McLane Stadium, the new home of Baylor Bears football. Beginning in Waco and continuing up until just before the I-35E/I-35W split north of Hillsboro, I-35 is co-located with U.S. Highway 77.  'My35' Expansion Project  Interstate 35 through Central Texas is undergoing major expansion and renovation. The project is known as 'Main Street Texas', which is part of the larger scale 'My35' expansion plan. The 'Main Street' project primarily focuses on expanding the number of main lanes from four to six through McLennan and Bell counties. It also calls for complete replacement of the main lane bridges over the Brazos River, and extensive renovations to frontage roads and interchanges throughout the corridor. Funding for the project has been secured, with the exception of the portion of freeway to be renovated through the Downtown Waco area. $280 million in funding has yet to be secured for that section of the project.  Dallas and Fort Worth   Denton and North Texas  Just southwest of Denton, Interstate 35W and Interstate 35E join to reform Interstate 35, which then continues north to the Oklahoma border. The exit numbers on I-35 continue on from the last exit of Interstate 35E. Just north of Denton, U.S. Highway 77 is co-located with Interstate 35 through to the Oklahoma border, although it is not signed as such.  History  Most of Interstate 35 was built along existing roadways, as shown on this 1919 State Highway map. The actual location of Interstate 35 is added as a yellow overlay.  South Texas   Central Texas  The right-of-way for the future Interstate 35 in Austin began being purchased in 1946, running along the so-called \\"inter-regional highway\\" (named for the precursor to the current Interstate Highway System). The formal opening of Interstate 35 in Austin took place in 1962. The alignment was chosen to line up with U.S. Highway 81 and with East Avenue, which formed the eastern boundary of Austin. US 81 has since been truncated and does not extend to Austin, and East Avenue today forms part of the frontage road for I-35 through downtown Austin. In 1963, while constructing an overpass in between Round Rock and Georgetown, Inner Space Cavern was discovered after a space was found more than once at below grade. A 3-foot hole was drilled into the space and an engineer was lowered into the hole for exploration. Later the Texas Speleological Association mapped the cavity and the Texas highway Department sealed the hole and completed the interstate. In 1975, a set of elevated express lanes were added to I-35 between 15th Street and Airport Boulevard. The reason double-decking was used is because the highway is bounded in the area by the University of Texas campus on the west and by the Mount Calvary Cemetery on the east, restricting the available right-of-way. The lower deck kept its original configuration, which featured short on- and off-ramps with limited visibility. In 2000, some off-ramps on the lower deck were removed, in response to the already dangerous conditions becoming more so as traffic levels on the road increased. Interstate 35 in general and the double-decked section in particular have been viewed as a social dividing line between the central Austin and U.T. communities and the more economically depressed East Austin neighborhoods. Interstate 35 at one time had one of the few at-grade railroad crossings in the Interstate Highway System. The crossing was removed during the 1970s.  North Texas  Construction on Interstate 35 in the DFW region began around 1960 with the upgrading of U.S. 77 to Interstate standards between Dallas and Denton. By 1965, Interstate 35 was complete from Dallas to the Oklahoma border, and by 1967 it was complete from both Dallas and Fort Worth southward to Austin. The remaining segment of Interstate 35W from Fort Worth to Denton was not completed until 1969.  Exit list   Auxiliary routes  I-35 has three auxiliary routes in Texas: *: a branch route of I-35 that runs from a split just north of Hillsboro, passing through Waxahachie, Dallas and Lewisville before reforming I-35 just west of Denton. *: a branch route of I-35 that runs from a split just north of Hillsboro, passing through Fort Worth before reforming I-35 just west of Denton. *: a partial loop around the northern and eastern boundaries of Dallas. I-635 intersects with I-35E in north Dallas, and does not intersect either I-35W or I-35.

It is endemic to Australia, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. Taxonomy John Gould described the striated thornbill in 1838, giving it the common name of striated acanthiza. Alternative common names include striped-crowned thornbill or tit-warbler, striated tit-warbler or tit, and green thornbill. The striated thornbill still bears its original name. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found that the ancestor of the striated thornbill diverged from that of the yellow thornbill around 6 million years ago. Four subspecies are recognised. * A. lineata alberti is found in southeast Queensland and is paler and more yellowish overall than the nominate subspecies. It has a bright orange-brown cap with prominent white streaks, and a yellow-olive back. There is a broad zone of intermediate birds stretching from Tenterfield south to Port Macquarie on the coast and Tamworth inland. * A. lineata lineata is found across New South Wales and Victoria, with a zone between the Grampians and Warrnambool, and the South Australian border where intermediate forms between this and clelandii are found. * A. lineata clelandii is smaller and paler than the nominate subspecies, though has a more greyish back. It is found in southeastern South Australia to Adelaide. * A. lineata whitei is smaller and darker than the nominate subspecies, with an overall greyish cast. It is found on Kangaroo Island. Description The adult striated thornbill is long and weighs around . It has a russet- or orange-brown crown with cream streaks, dull yellow-olive upperparts, olive-grey flanks, and cream underparts heavily streaked with black. The brown thornbill (A. pusilla) is similar but lacks the white-streaked orange-brown cap and lives in shrubs. Feeding The striated thornbill is predominantly insectivorous, generally forages in the canopy of eucalypt trees, gleaning leaves for prey. It often hangs upside-down while foraging. The striated thornbill also visits and feeds on extra-floral nectaries on the leaves of sunshine wattle (Acacia terminalis), helping pollinate the plant as it brushes against flower heads while feeding. Breeding Striated thornbills form flocks of 7‚Äì20 birds outside of breeding season from late summer to winter, before breaking up into groups of 2‚Äì4, composed of a breeding pair plus helper birds.

Noodles are used by people of all ages while swimming. Pool noodles are useful when learning to swim, for floating, for rescue reaching, in various forms of water play, and for aquatic exercise. The most common dimensions are about in length and in diameter. The pool noodle is also used for people who experience difficulties in swimming. The pool noodle is often used to protect sharp edges and corners.  Types  The term \\"water woggle\\" derives from Koswell Holdings trademark Water Woggle, which was first marketed as a foam water toy in the 1980s. The term \\"noodle\\" derives from Jakks Pacific's trademark FunNoodle water product, which was created as a foam tube water toy. Canoodle (\\"connect a noodle\\") is the polypropylene (plastic) erector set manufactured in the US by Serranoventions. A Noodleskin is a custom cover that is placed over a foam pool noodle which allows two pool noodles to be made into a floating seat.  Connectors  There are several pool noodle connectors on the market. One connector is a piece of pipe made out of foam, slightly larger than a pool noodle so that it can connect two pool noodles by encasing the end of each. There are several other connector made of food grade polypropylene and manufactured in Australia and the USA. This noodle connector comes in the form of an erector set that is screwed into the cavity or center of the foam noodle and attaches to a 6 sided noodle connector. This allows larger structures to be built from pool noodles. There exist at least two-, four- and six-hole foam connectors and a variety of polypropylene connector parts that enable users to build all types of structures and designs.  Other uses  Pool noodles are similar to some types of industrial and residential foam insulation for pipes. Pipe insulation sleeves are made from a variety of materials, primarily EPDM rubber foam (which typically has greater resistance to high temperatures than expanded polyethylene foam). Despite this, pool noodles have been used as an improvised substitute for commercial pipe insulation. Live action role-playing games often use pool noodles as foam weapons. It is generally the least expensive form of construction available and very easy to make into a safe weapon, however, pool noodle foam is more prone to break down with extended use than other types of foam. Modern martial artists occasionally use pool noodles as tameshigiri (test cutting) targets, in lieu of more expensive targets like meat or tatami omote mats. FIRST Robotics Competition robots use the foam from pool noodles as a bumper to protect the robots from damage during collisions. Shoe shops use short lengths of pool noodles to support women's boots for display. Customers often use pool noodles for their own boots to prevent the boots flopping over in the closet. Cyclists have begun to use them as a safety tool. People have also begun to use them as protection, when posting bicycle frames forks and other bicycle parts.

Acanthiza had been previously placed in the family Pardalotidae, but are now part of the Acanthizidae. Description Chestnut-rumped thornbill (Sturt Desert, NSW). Length: 9.8 cm (9-11); wing span 15.5 cm (14-16.5); weight: 6 g. Mid-sized thornbill similar in size and shape to inland thornbill (A. apicalis) and slaty-backed thornbill (A. robustirostris). Pale and plain with pale iris similar to buff-rumped (Acanthiza reguloides), western (A.inornata), slender-billed (A. iredalei) and yellow-rumped thornbills (A. chrysorrhoa). Pale grey-brown upper, rich chestnut rump and mostly black tail with pale tips, pale mottled ear-coverts and rufous suffusion on forehead and crown. Plain whitish underbody. The sexes are alike, with no seasonal variation. Slight geographic variations, birds of the more arid inland are paler and greyer above, with a slightly paler rump patch and cleaner white below than those in coastal and subcoastal regions. May be confused with other thornbills having a rufous-brown rump patch such as brown thornbill (A. pusilla), inland thornbill (A. apicalis) and slaty-backed thornbills (A. robustirostris). Gregarious usually in small flocks, twos or threes and sometimes with other thornbills and small passerines. Active and restless, the chestnut-rumped thornbill forages in shrubs and trees, searching briskly, flitting and hopping in foliage and low branches, probing into crevices and bark. It also hops on the ground searching among fallen debris. Flight similar to other thornbills, cover to cover in low undulating dashes. Voice is penetrating, with a far-carrying song of similar phrases. It also mimics other birds. Juveniles are similar to adults, but plainer with duller head pattern, and pale buff tail tips, not white. Iris is slightly duller, cream or greyish white. Nearly fledged juveniles have pale yellow gape. Distribution and population thumbleftMap of Australia with chestnut- rumped thornbill distribution.Atlas of living Australia. (2013).

Feeding Chestnut-rumped thornbills are mainly insectivores but occasionally eat seeds. Studies on stomach contents show spiders, insects, plants, seeds and buds. They mostly forage in foliage and from branches of shrubs and low trees but also regularly on the ground, by gleaning 81.8% (leaves, twigs, branches, ground), sallying 4.37% and 13.9% by probing into bark. The young are fed tiny insects and small white grubs.Leach, H. A. C. (1928 ). The birds of Central Northern Victoria. Emu, 28(2), 83 - 99. doi:10.1071/MU928083 They are gregarious and rarely seen singly. Feeding flocks are usually small parties of up to ten, and less often up to 20 birds, associating with brown thornbill (A. pusilla), yellow-rumped thornbill (A. chrysorrhoa), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), white-browed scrubwrens (Sericornis frontalis) or redthroats (Pyrrholaemus brunneus), and occasionally joined by silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). In South Australia during winter, may congregate in mixed feeding groups with yellow (A. nana), yellow-rumped (A. chrysorrhoa) and buff-rumped thornbills (A. reguloides), with up to 100 or more birds in groups. Breeding Pair of chestnut-rumped thornbills (Sturt Desert, NSW). Most records of chestnut-rumped thornbills breeding involve pairs, however they appear occasionally to breed co- operatively. Breeding season is June - December, and two broods, possibly three can be raised per season. The ovoid eggs are laid at two-day intervals. They are very fine, slightly glossy, flesh-white and minutely freckled all over with reddish brown and purplish brown, particularly at the large- end.Johnstone, R., & Storr, G. M. (2004).

Emu, 15(1), 35 - 36. doi:10.1071/MU915035 Nest sites are usually in hollows, often vertical, in live and dead trees, with the entrance at the end of a spout, crevice or knothole, in the side of a branch or trunk. They also nest in stumps, logs or branches lying on the ground and in fence posts.J.N.McGilp. (1922). Birds of the Lake Frome District, South Australia. Part II. Emu, 22(4), 274 - 287. doi:10.1071/MU922274 The chicks are altricial and nidicolous, with both adults feeding the nestlings and fledglings.Sedgwick, E. H. (1936). Notes on the Chestnut-tailed Thornbill. Emu, 35(3), 231 - 232. doi:10.1071/MU935231Lloyd, A. (1982). Communal feeding in Chestnut-Rumped Thornbills. Sunbird: Journal of the Queensland Ornithological Society, 12(2/3). The fledging period is around 18‚Äì20 days. Both adults are involved with building nests, which are small, neat and domed usually ovoid, with a rounded entrance at side or near top. If inside a hollow, the entrance is often flush with the opening of the hollow. Materials used are dried grass, bark strips, plant stems, moss, lichen and spider web, with a lining of feathers, wool or fur. Chestnut-rumped thornbills are known to be parasitised by Horsfield's bronze cuckoos (Chalcites basalis).Brooker, M., & Brooker, L. (2003).

Emu, 103(4), 357 - 361. doi:10.1071/MU02034 Conservation Chestnut-rumped thornbill (Sturt Desert, NSW). Range: The chestnut-rumped thornbill has an extremely large range, and therefore does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence <20,000 km2 combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation).Birdlife International. (2013). Species factsheet: Acanthiza uropygialis. Retrieved 14 Oct 2013, from http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=5435 Population trend: Though the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years or three generations). Population size: This has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as least concern. However, the chestnut-rumped thornbill is on a list of declining woodland birds,Watson, D. (2011). A productivity-based explanation for woodland bird declines: poorer soils yield less food. Emu, 111(1), 10 -18. doi: 10.1071/MU09109Reid, J. R. W. (1999).

CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology, Canberra. characterized mostly by being ground or low-shrub feeders and dwellers as well as being predominantly insectivores. The clearing of woodlands on fertile soils and overgrazing of remaining native vegetation, has resulted in fewer ground-dwelling invertebrate prey, causing chestnut-rumped thornbill's range to be possibly contracting towards the inland.

It is endemic to Tasmania and King Island in Australia. Its natural habitat is the temperate rainforest, Nothofagus beech forest and eucalypt woodland. It is a small species that resembles the Sericornis scrubwrens (with which it was once placed). Taxonomy The scrubtit belongs to the monotypic genus Acanthornis.IOC-Classification: Scrubtit (Acanthornis magna), Acanticidae in order Passeriformes A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the scrubtit diverged from that of the three whitefaces of the genus Aphelocephala around 7 million years ago. The combined lineage had diverged from the thornbill lineage around 13 million years ago. Description The scrubtit is long and weighs around . The plumage consists of a white throat and belly, a brown back, crown, flank and tail, black wings and grey on the face. The eye is pale and the bill is short, black and slightly curved. The species is often silent, but makes quite loud contact calls and has a song described as \\"sweet [and] musical\\". Behaviour The scrubtit forages individually, in pairs or in small family groups near the ground in dense cover. It feeds on small invertebrates, particularly insects and their eggs. The species will associate with mixed- species feeding flocks. The species is territorial and monogamous, with the breeding season lasting from September to January. The nest is a woven globe with a side entrance, lined with feathers and fur, camouflaged and usually found between 1‚Äì3 m off the ground. The clutch size is usually three eggs but sometimes four. The eggs measure and are pearly white, with fine reddish spots, mostly around the larger end.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. No information exists about incubation or nestling times. Both parents feed the chicks in the nest, but unlike many Australian passerines helpers have never been reported.See for instance Old endemics and new invaders: alternative strategies of passerines for living in the Australian environment The species is victim to brood parasitism by fan-tailed cuckoos (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and shining bronze-cuckoos (Chrysococcyx lucidus), and quolls (Dasyurus) also take eggs and nestlings.Gregory, P.

The airline was given permission for ten flights a week to the United States by Australian regulators on 24 July 2007. The plans were approved by US regulators on 15 February 2008, due to the signing of an open skies agreement between Australia and the US.Virgin Blue signs up for open skies to the US Sydney Morning Herald 15 February 2008 V Australia has since been allowed unlimited capacity between Australia and the U.S. by the Australian International Air Services Commission. V Australia later applied to the United States Department of Transportation to operate services to and from Sydney to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, and New York. Permission from the United States Department of Transportation was given after the signing of the open skies agreement.

The estimated population of the pink-legged graveteiro is between 2,500 and 9,999 individuals left in the wild.BirdLife International (2007) Species factsheet: Acrobatornis fonsecai Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 27/4/2008 Its main habitat is cocoa plantations. It is the only member of the genus Acrobatornis. Description The pink-legged graveteiro's most distinctive feature is, as the name suggests, its bright- pink legs and feet. The plumage, as an adult, is mainly black and gray, although juveniles are commonly more brown in color. Its size is comparable to that of a warbler at about as an adult, and the graveteiro is thought to be stout for a bird its size.Line, Les. ‚ÄúNew Bird Found in Brazil Forest Owes Survival to Cocoa.‚Äù The New York Times 19 November 1996 One way to tell you have found a pink-legged graveteiro is by its unique song, usually high- pitched and beginning with sparse notes, then it accelerating, and finally finishing with a long trill. Diet and feeding The scientific name of the species, Acrobatornis fonsecai is a reference to its acrobatic habits. It tends to hang upside-down under the canopies of trees while slinking along searching for its next meal. The diet of this bird includes mainly insects and more specifically Coleoptera, which are beetles. Some other species that were found in the stomachs of the birds were termites, moths, ants, insect larvae, insect eggs, and spiders. Breeding The pink-legged graveteiro has many special characteristics concerning the nest that it builds. One feature of the nests is that they are shaped kind of like an oven with a single chamber inside with a roof, instead of being open on top like common nests,Wilson, W., Pacheco, J., Fonseca, P., ‚ÄúThe Nest and Nesting Ecology of Acrobatornis fonsecai (Furnariidae), with Implications for Intrafamilial Relationships.‚Äù In The Wilson Bulletin 108 (1996): 434-448 which is why some people call it an ovenbird. Nests are made up of sticks and twigs, and are lined with leaves and moss. The pink-legged graveteiro tends to prefer Leguminosae trees for nesting. In a study done of the nesting of the pink-legged graveteiro, it was discovered that the nests were positioned in the canopies of tall shade trees. Also in the same study, where 131 nests were observed in seventy-four nesting trees, it was recorded that on average there were 1.8 nests per tree, and that the tree with the most nests had five. The interesting part about this study is that only one of the nests in each tree is actually used. The others are a kind of ‚Äúmock‚Äù nest, and are usually smaller. The pink-legged graveteiro does this to ward off predators and to even use them as a resource for future nest building. These nests are put to use sometime between or after September and October, which happens to be their breeding season. Within the nest every family member does their part: both male and female parents play their role in the feeding of the two to three young that they produce and which still need help feeding. Unusually for a funariid, offspring that are not quite adults but can fly help with the feeding of the young, and with some repairs around the nest.Supplementary Papers; in Cockburn, Andrew; ‚Äú Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds‚Äù in Proceedings of the Royal Society for Biological Sciences, 7 June 2006 vol. 273 no. 1592 Conservation and threats The Atlantic Forest of Brazil, where the pink-legged graveteiro is located, originally covered of land and has quickly been reduced down to 7 percent of its original size.‚ÄúPlaces We Work, The Atlantic Forest of Brazil.‚Äù The Nature Conservancy in Brazil, 2007. Retrieved 26 April 2008 The forest used to stretch from Rio Grande do Norte and Cear√° to the north, to Rio Grande do Sol to the south.‚ÄúAtlantic Forest.‚Äù in Hotspots. 04 Apr 2008. The Environmental Literacy Council. 27 Apr 2008 It also used to spread out over the coastal plains and the foothills and slopes of Serra do Mar.\\"Ecosystem Profile: Atlantic Forest.\\" Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. 01 Dec 2001. Conservation International, 27 April 2008 Five percent of all vertebrates on earth call this forest home, and there are 2,200 different types of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The Atlantic Forest holds eight percent of all the plants found on earth, including 20,000 different types of plants, with more being discovered all the time. Because of its biodiversity, the Atlantic Forest is rightfully considered a biological hotspot. Some other statistics that directly affect the pink-legged graveteiro are that sixty percent of all Brazil's endangered animals reside here, and there are almost two hundred different bird species that are only found is this remote location on earth. The degradation of the Atlantic Forest began when the Portuguese pioneers came over to settle the land. To get cattle they would chop down the trees and use it as an export trade and in return they would get the cattle. Also, the French and Spanish settlers cleared the forest for their cattle ranches. These same ideas still dominate the thinking of Brazil's population today, so that remnant tropical rainforest clearing continues. Another threat to the Atlantic Forest is population increase and the many problems that come with it. Currently the portion of Brazil that happens to have the most potential to have for the greatest biodiversity is the most populated region of Brazil. This area makes up 70% of Brazil's population, and it is the location of the majority of its industries with two of the three most populated cities in South America are located here, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. All of this poses major threats to the survival of the Atlantic Forest. As these two huge towns increase there will be a demand to expand which will mean taking out even more of the precious forest. They will want to make way for new housing developments as well as space for more industries to be manufactured. Along with all of this expansion and industrialization comes pollution. All different types of pollution, water, air, soil, all things that will hinder the integrity of the Atlantic Forest. Along with the people moving into Brazil comes the need for roads. The building of roads through the forests have left species of animals isolated in fragmented spaces when some of them need a large amount of space to survive. Another problem that the Atlantic Forest faces is logging. Logging is an age old business in Brazil, but has recently expanded to the point where the government had to ban it entirely in 1990, but, done mainly illegally, logging continues to expand. The harm that this does to the land is obvious. When you wipe out a creatures habitat you take away everything they need to survive which may wipe them out too if something is not done. Monoculture and intensive land use are also harmful to the Atlantic forest, and they may go hand in hand. Eucalyptus trees are one example of a monoculture that has hurt the integrity of the forest as well as stripping the soil of nutrients without putting much back. Another intensive use of the land is grazing, whereby owners burn the forests and allow the cattle to overgraze the land o make room for the 1.8 million cows that occupy the region. The pink-legged graveteiro populates a small area in the southeastern part of Bahia, Brazil in a part of the Atlantic Forest. More specifically, from the Rio de Contas in the north, to the Rio Jequitinhonha in the south, and from Ipiau in the west, to Itabuna in east. This part of Brazil gets more than of rain a year, and is a very hot and humid location. Much of this naturally forested area has been converted into cocoa plantations, which is good news for the pink-legged graveteiro because its survival seems to depend on the presence of cocoa trees. Although cocoa plantations are a type of agriculture and a lot of the biodiversity of an area is wiped out, they are one of the least destructive forms of agriculture when habitat conservation is evaluated. The main reason for this is that cocoa trees live in the under story of large shade trees.Greenburg, Russell.\\"Shade Grown Cocoa\\"; Migratory Bird Center, 29 November 2006. In Smithsonian National Zoological Park. 27 April 2008 The process for preparing the land for cocoa fields consists of clearing the under story of the forest, and reducing the canopy to about 10 percent of the trees that are naturally found. This type of agriculture is beneficial because the plantations can support life at more than one level compared to types of monoculture that can only hold life at one level. It also creates habitat that connects other habitats, which helps lessen the problem of habitat fragmentation. The pink-legged graveteiro really uses the cocoa plantations to the best of its ability. In the upper level, in the shade trees is where they make their nests and raise their young. In the lower levels of cocoa trees is where the pink-legged graveteiro does its foraging. There is enough biodiversity in the lower level to support all the food sources the pink-legged graveteiro needs to survive. The cocoa plantations are facing many threats that will harm the pink-legged graveteiro if they are not reversed. When dealing with the ‚ÄúEvil Quartet‚Äù, habitat destruction and some over exploitation of the land are the two main factors driving the pink-legged graveteiro to endangerment. The overexploitation comes from cattle overgrazing in the pastures. The habitat destruction comes from many different problems. The first is the switch from shade crops to partly sun or even full sun crops, which will eliminate the different levels that sustain life in the shade plantations. Also, about 5,000 km of cocoa plantation are estimated to be converted to pasture land in the coming years.McGinley, Mark. ‚ÄúBahia Coastal Forests‚Äù The Encyclopedia of Earth. 16 October 2007. Retrieved 27 April 2008 This will further habitat fragmentation of this area making it hard for animals that reside in the plantation to move from one part of their habitat to another part of their habitat. One problem that the plantations have already experienced and was very detrimental to their livelihood was the outbreak of a disease called ‚ÄúWitches‚Äô Broom‚Äù in the 1980s and 1990s. Witches‚Äô Broom is caused by the fungus Crinipellis pernicious, which around that period wiped out a large portion of the cocoa produced in Brazil and other surrounding countries.\\"Biochemical changes during the development of witches' broom: the most important disease of cocoa in Brazil caused by Crinipellis perniciosa\\"; in Journal of Experimental Botany 56 (2005): 865-877 At about the same time, the market for cocoa crashed so that the owners had nothing to do for money except chop down the trees and sell them for cash, destroying the pink-legged graveteiro's habitat. The first part of restoring the pink-legged graveteiro back to sustainable numbers, is the conservation of the Atlantic Forest. There are many conservation efforts already in place that are meant to serve the Atlantic Forest, which is home to five percent of the world's vertebrate species and eight percent of the world's plants. Only about eight percent of unbroken original habitat is left to support this hotspot.Duffy, Emmett; \\"Biological Diversity in the Atlantic Forest\\" The Encyclopedia of Earth. 15 October 2007. Retrieved 28 April 2008 The government of Brazil is working to protect this vital piece of habitat by setting aside land for 108 national state parks, 85 federal and state biological reserves, and 31 federal and state ecological reserves, totaling 225 different areas set aside for conservation. Another successful program put in place is the private reserve system, which covers almost 1,000 kilometers of the Atlantic Forest. One main strategy that is in place to encourage biodiversity is establishing corridors because the habitats that are remaining are severely fragmented. There are many corridors being established to connect the wildlife, but the main one in the Atlantic Forest is located in the south part of Bahia and Espirito Santo. One agency that is in the process of protecting the Atlantic Forest is the Nature Conservancy which has been in business since 1991 with a host of partners to help it along. Their plan is to have of forest restored and protected by 2015. The Nature Conservancy's main way of accomplishing this is through corridors. These corridors will help reduce the growing fragmentation problems in Brazil and ensure the gene exchange throughout the different populations that inhabit the land. One key point that the Nature Conservancy recognizes is the needs of the people that live in area). Through their program they plan to develop economic alternatives that will support both forest protection and the local people, and also provide incentives for conservation. Another group that is helping the Atlantic Forest is the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund, which was started in 2002. Through this program they strive to conserve threatened and endangered species through the Species Protection Program. Also, they help people that own land in Brazil manage their land in a sustainable way through the Program for Supporting Private Natural Heritage Reserves. Not only will this support biodiversity, but it will also ensure that the land is usable in the coming years. Lastly, the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund will supply the technology and support that is needed for private conservation efforts through the Institutional Strengthening Program. If the people do not have the technology and support that is necessary there will be no way for them to manage their land in a sustainable way. There have also been recommended ways to increase the biodiversity within the cocoa plantations themselves. One way is to increase the diversity of the shade crops that are used. The different types of shade crops that are brought in will bring their own pieces of biodiversity with them adding to the total biodiversity of the farm. It would also be beneficial if the shade crops that are planted were native to the area. This helps keep out a member of the ‚ÄúEvil Quartet‚Äù, invasive species. If the farmer sticks with what is naturally found in Brazil no harmful species will accidentally be brought in. Another way that is recommended is to leave buffer zones of the natural vegetation on the edges of streams, property lines, and forest reserves. This may be a small way to add biodiversity, but if every farmer started using this tactic it would all equal out to be a large contribution to biodiversity. Also, farmers could leave small trees to grow when they are weeding their fields. Not only will this add to biodiversity of the plantation, it will also allow for more, fresh shade trees in the future. Throughout this all the native people of Brazil really need to be kept in mind. There are a few ways to do this and they include many incentives for supporting biodiversity, because without incentives the farmer is more likely to destroy the land. Some ways would be to guarantee free trade, access to pre-harvest credit, and taxing agrochemical inputs. One group that has helped the pink-legged graveteiro specifically is Birdlife, who believes that many of the practices used in cocoa farming are not all that bad compared to other different types of agriculture.Langley, Nick; \\"Saving Brazil's Atlantic Forest.\\" Birdlife International, 13 August 2003. Retrieved 28 Apr 2008 So in their conservation effort they want to encourage and assist farmers in becoming organically certified. To be an organic cocoa farmer you must maintain 20 percent of original forest on their farms. The 20 percent more original forest will give the pink-legged graveteiro a lot more space for nesting, and will also help all other types of wildlife that thrive in the original forest. It is a way to help deal with the large problem of habitat fragmentation that is happening in the Atlantic Forest by connecting the environments that surround the farms. This plan will also help the farmers. There is growing market for organically grown food, and in the end they may end up profiting from going organic. It will also help maintain the integrity of the soil so that future generations will be able to farm there too.

The name Actinodura is derived from Greek words meaning \\"ray-like tail\\" ( and ) while sodangorum came from the S√∂dang tribe (also known as Xo Dang) which lives in Ngoc Linh and other areas in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos where black-crowned barwings are distributed.  Taxonomy  The first black-crowned barwing sighting was reported in April 1996 at Ngoc Linh, Vietnam. Prior to survey, the central highland area of Vietnam was mostly ornithologically undiscovered. Many observations were made by Jonathon Charles Eames and Roland Eve, but took until March 17, 1998 to trap a male bird. An official species description was later published in 1999. Black-crowned barwings consist of a monotypic group; having no other discovered subspecies. They were quickly classified into Actinodura since are very similar to Actinodura ramsayi in appearance. Three plumage differences set them apart; the lores are black, the posterior is darker olive-brown, and the tail feathers are darker with narrower white tips.  Description  The black-crowned barwing is the only bird in the Actinodura to have a black crown. It has transverse barring on the wings (wingbars) and presence of a crest, which are characters of the Genus Actinodura (barwings).  Colouration  The colouration in black-crowned barwings is similar between the sexes. They have a grey head and nape, black crown and lore (space between eye and beak), white eye rings, dark brown irises, and dark beak with a flesh coloured tip. Its throat is streaked with black-brown on a base of rufous-orange that matches the breast and belly area. The posterior parts of the body (mantle, back, rump, and uppertail coverts) are olive-brown with indistinct dark bars. The wings have fine bars on the scapulars (upper wing section) and black-brown with chestnut or orange-buff bars on most of the flight feathers (primaries and secondaries). Their long tail is graduated chestnut with white tips and broad black bars. See External Links for Images.  Measurements  The lengths are approximately: * Upper beak (culmen) = 17.5mm * Leg length (starting from under the knees) = 31mm * Single wing length (measured from chord to mass) = 89mm * Tail-length = 133mm  Habitat and distribution  They are residents to three locations in Laos and 7 locations in Vietnam, also found in Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA) include the DakChung Plateau, Lo Xo Pass, and Ngoc Linh. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, and plantations. Although they use degraded/cleared forests, they were mostly found in secondary growth or evergreen forests. Their elevation maximum was at 2400m, with observers noting less sightings above 2200m. The minimum elevation range could not be determined properly since the site contained loss of forest habitat below 1500m, though there were sightings at 1000m. See External Links for Distribution map.  Behaviour  Sightings have been either of single birds or bird in pairs.  Vocalization  Most observations were of singing birds since they are easily identified through song and were responsive to playbacks, which was a commonly used technique. They call the most in early morning, decreasing through the day, which could be caused by the rainfall decreasing bird activity and calling. They have two distinctive calls: * One of the calls begins with a male or female giving two or three \\"wa\\" wails that sound cat-like with the first note always weakest and second note stronger. After 5-20 calls from the initiator, the second bird responds with five or six short notes with overall same length and pitch. * The other call lasts for as long as the first bird continues and includes antiphonal duets, where males and females respond to each other differently. Pairs were also spotted sitting side-by-side mutually preening between their calls.  Diet  Their diet is not well known, but suspected to be an insectivore or eating vegetation. The bird is often seen foraging alone or with a partner around the smaller branches of tree canopy, trunk, and along larger moss-covered branches.  Reproduction  Mates are first attracted through calling, then moving to small branches in shrubs while perching close or against each other. The male displays by raising his crest and half-fanning his feathers while the female opens her wings less frequently and leans steeply over her perch. They preen each other briefly and rapidly with light pecking, while switching positions. Instances of copulating or almost copulating involved the birds swinging full circle around a branch where their tail-bases would briefly touch while moving downwards. This behaviour is not known in barwings, but more common in babblers (family Timaliidae). Generation lengths are around 5.5 years. Eggs and nest are undescribed.  Conservation status  It is threatened by habitat loss.

He was its first king, the first Greek king in Africa and the founder of the Battiad dynasty. The butterfly Battus philenor is named after him. Background Battus was born in an unknown village on the Greek island of Thera. What is known of Battus‚Äô family background is from the Greek historian Herodotus. His father, Polymnestus, was a Therean nobleman and his mother was named Phronima. She was a princess of Oaxus (a city on the Greek island of Crete). Her father, Etearchus or Eteachos, was King of Oaxus. When Phronima‚Äôs mother, then Queen of Oaxus (whose name is unknown) died, Etearchus remarried. Phronima‚Äôs stepmother (whose name is also unknown) became Queen. She did everything to torment Phronima, most notably by falsely accusing her of fornication. When Etearchus heard of this, he befriended a Therean merchant living in Oaxus called Themiston and convinced him to swear an oath that he would perform any task the king asked him to do. Etearchus fetched Phronima, had her put in Themiston‚Äôs charge, and asked him to throw her into the sea. Themiston, in order to clear himself of the obligation, took Phronima on his ship, lowered her into water with a rope, and hauled her back in the ship (i.e. he did not kill her as ordered).Herodotus, transl. Aubrey de Selincourt, Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 294 Themiston then sailed with Phronima back to his home island of Thera. There, Phronima became the mistress of a distinguished nobleman called Polymnestus, who was a member of the Minyan family of the Euphemidae. Phronima bore Polymnestus a son, Battus. Herodotus does not give his real name, but according to Pindar,Pyth v. 116 his birth name was Aristotle. Justin gives him the name of Aristaeus and states after his death in Cyrene he was worshipped by the name of Aristaeus.Justin xiii.7 In any case, Battus in ancient Greek means stammer (because he had a speech impediment as a child), while in the Libyan language battus means king. Herodotus opines that he was not known as Battus until he left for Libya. Delphic consultations In ca. 639 BC the king of Thera, Grinnus, travelled from the island to visit the oracle of Delphi, to seek advice on various matters. At that time, Thera had a severe drought and there was no rainfall for seven years. The population was also increasing and could no longer support its residents. One of the men that accompanied the king was Battus. When Grinnus asked for the priestess' advice, she gave him a seemingly irrelevant response. She told him that he must go to Libya and found a city there, on advice from the God Apollo. The king was too old for this journey and commissioned Battus to complete the task. The only problem was that neither of them knew where Libya was.Herodotus, transl. Aubrey de Selincourt, Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 292 When Grinnus and Battus returned to Thera, the drought had worsened and the people were in great distress. The king sent some Thereans to once again seek the advice of the Oracle. The priestess repeated the same message, that they must found a colony in Libya for their fortunes to mend. Grinnus then sent a group of men from the island to travel to Crete to inquire about the natives of Libya or anyone who had been to Libya. The group of men landed in Itanus and met a fisherman called Corobius, who explained to the men that he had once been blown out of course and ended up on Platea, an island off the Libyan coast. Initial efforts The Thereans paid Corobius to come with them to Thera and shortly after, with a small party and Corobius as pilot, they set sail for Libya. The men landed on Platea and left Corobius there with enough supplies for a short while and then returned to their island bringing good news about finding the new colony. Corobius agreed to wait on Platea for a length of time, however his supplies began to run out. Luckily, a Samian vessel bound for Egypt under command of Colaeus was re-routed to Platea due to poor weather conditions. The crew gave Corobius enough food to last one year. Colaeus and his crew were anxious to reach their destination as easterly winds prevented them from travelling to Egypt and they were driven as west as the Pillar of Hercules (modern Strait of Gibraltar). By their luck they landed at the wealthy trading post of Tartessus.Herodotus, transl. Aubrey de Selincourt, Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 293 When the group of Thereans returned to their island and had told everyone of the new settlement, they decided then to send a new party of people representing the seven villages of the island (drawn by lot). The King and the people picked Battus as the leader for the journey to Platea. Battus and the others sailed in two penteconters. When the two ships had reached the coast, Battus could not decide what next to do and ordered that they sail back home. When they returned to Thera, however, the locals refused to allow them back on the shore and threw things at them from the harbour, shouting for Battus and his crew to go back. Founding of Cyrene Battus and the two ships journeyed once more to Platea, where they lived for two years, unable to establish themselves properly there.Herodotus, transl. Aubrey de Selincourt, Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 295 Leaving one man on the island, they returned to Delphi and consulted the Oracle again about Libya and their current poor conditions. She advised them to settle on the mainland. So, they sailed back to Platea, and established a settlement, a town called Aziris (south of Platea near a river and many valleys). The Thereans lived there for six years on friendly terms with the Libyans. After a treaty with the locals, the Libyans persuaded them to leave Aziris and took them west through fine agricultural country called Irasa to Apollo's Fountain. The Libyan guides told Battus and his group of men ‚Äòthis is the place for you settle in, for here there is a hole in the sky‚Äô. This may refer to amount of great rainfall in the area, which is rare in Africa. Battus named this new settlement (founded in ca. 630 BC)John Boardman, The Greeks Overseas, Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 152 Cyrene. The name comes from a fountain called \\"Cyre\\", which was believed to have been consecrated to Apollo. In addition to naming the settlement, Battus made all the colonists swear an oath. There is an inscription dated from the 4th century BC, which claims to contain the original oath. Although little is known of Battus' reign, he appeared to govern with mildness and moderation. He was also apparently a vigorous ruler, successful in cementing a colony and taking advantages of the natural surrounding environment.

Hope, Eireann Marshall Page 12 Making Time for the Past: Local History and the Polis By Katherine Clarke Page 170.5 figure by his subjects. His grave is near the marketplace which joins the road whose construction he ordered, leading to the temple of Apollo. A statue of Battus was dedicated at Delphi, by the subjects of Cyrene. He is represented riding in a chariot driven by the nymph of Cyrene, with a figure symbolising Libya in the act of crowning him King. His dynasty is known as the Battiad dynasty after him. He was succeeded by his son Arcesilaus I.Herodotus, transl.

It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company UCB. In India it is co-promoted and distributed by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. Medical uses Brivaracetam is used to treat partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation, in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. No data are available for its effectiveness and safety in patients younger than 16 years.Drugs.com: for Briviact. It is sometimes prescribed as an alternative to the drug's analogue levetiracetam to avoid neuropsychiatric adverse effects such as mood swings, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects include sleepiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. More rarely, coordination problems and changes in behaviour can occur. Interactions Coadministration of brivaracetam with carbamazepine may increase exposure to carbamazepine-epoxide, the active metabolite of carbamazepine, and could theoretically lead to reduced tolerability. Coadministration of brivaracetam with phenytoin may increase phenytoin levels. Coadministration of other antiseizure drugs are unlikely to affect brivaracetam exposure. Brivaracetam provides no added therapeutic benefit when administered in conjunction with levetiracetam that acts on the same protein. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Brivaracetam is believed to act by binding to the ubiquitous synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), like levetiracetam. but with 20-fold greater affinity. There is some evidence that racetams including levetiracetam and brivaracetam access the luminal side of recycling synaptic vesicles during vesicular endocytosis. They may reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release and enhance synaptic depression during trains of high-frequency activity, such as is believed to occur during epileptic activity. Pharmacokinetics Brivaracetam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose range, is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, has an elimination half-life of seven to eight hours, and has plasma protein binding of less than 20%. It is extensively metabolized (>90%), primarily via hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and secondarily through hydroxylation mediated by the liver enzyme CYP2C19. The three major metabolites (hydroxy, acid, and hydroxyacid) are pharmacologically inactive. Brivaracetam is eliminated as urinary metabolites, with over 95% of a radioactive test dose recovered in the urine within 72 hours, including only 8.6% as unchanged brivaracetam.  Pharmacogenetics  As noted above, brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis, via amidase enzymes, to an inactive metabolite. To a lesser extent, it is also metabolized by a minor metabolic pathway via CYP2C19-dependent hydroxylation. Individuals who have no CYP2C19 enzyme activity, \\"CYP2C19 poor metabolizers\\", will have a greater exposure to standard doses of brivaracetam. Because they are less able to metabolize the drug to its inactive form for excretion, they may have an increased risk of adverse effects. The most common adverse effects of brivaracetam therapy include sedation, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The FDA-approved drug label for brivaracetam states that patients who are CYPC19 poor metabolizers, or are taking medicines that inhibit CYP2C19, may require a dose reduction. Chemical and physical properties Levetiracetam, for comparison Brivaracetam is the 4R-propyl analogue of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam. History Positive preliminary results from stage III trials were recorded in 2008, along with evidence that it is around ten times more potent for the prevention of certain types of seizure in mouse models than its analogue levetiracetam. On 14 January 2016, the European Commission, and on 12 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved brivaracetam under the trade name Briviact. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued an interim final rule placing brivaracetam into schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) effective 9 March 2017. , brivaracetam is not approved in some other countries, such as Switzerland. It was approved in Australia in August 2016. In Canada it was approved on 9 March 2016 under the trade name Brivlera.  Legality   Australia  Brivaracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020).Poisons Standard February 2020. comlaw.gov.au A schedule 4 substance is classified as \\"Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy ‚Äì Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.\\"  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Category:Anticonvulsants Category:Carboxamides Category:Racetams ","title":"Brivaracetam"},{"id":"12434983","text":"The white-throated bushtit (Aegithalos niveogularis), also known as the white- throated tit, is a species of bird in the family Aegithalidae.

Taxonomy This species was described as Jora viridissima by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. Harry C. Oberholser described subspecies Aegithina viridissima thapsina from the Anamba Islands in 1917, noting its larger size and yellower plumage. These two subspecies are recognised by the IOC World Bird List, while Aegithina viridissima nesiotica described by Oberholser in 1912 is now included in the nominate subspecies. Description The green iora is long. The male has black lores and bright yellow \\"eyelids\\" (a broken eye-ring). The face and upperparts are dark olive. The wings are black, with two white wing-bars on the covert feathers and olive-yellow margins on the flight feathers. The underparts are also dark olive, with lighter flanks and a yellow centre belly. The tail is black. The eyes are dark to red brown, the beak is grey-blue, and the feet are slaty blue. The female has yellow lores and a complete eye-ring. The upperparts and tail are medium olive. The wings are similar to those of the male but are washed olive, and the wing-bars are yellow instead. The underparts are olive green, with a yellow tint on the centre belly. The juvenile bird is similar to the female, but is paler. Distribution and habitat This species is found in Tenasserim, the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and some small neighbouring islands, and it is locally extinct in Singapore. It lives in the canopy of lowland forests up to in elevation, and is also found in tall secondary forest, peat swamp forest and mangrove forest. Behaviour This iora often occurs in pairs or small groups. It feeds on invertebrates, regularly joining mixed-species foraging flocks. The contact call is a whining, descending ji-sheur or ji-wier, and a ji-jirijiri- jeh mating call has been recorded. The green iora is usually sociable, but intense fighting has also been observed. Breeding has been recorded in April and May. The cup-shaped nest is built on a tree above the ground. Both the male and female incubate the eggs, and nestlings are brooded in rainy weather. Moulting has been recorded in July and August. Status The population is probably declining because of habitat loss caused by logging and land conversion.

Taxonomy  Mrs.Gould's sunbird was first described by Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors in 1831 and named after British bird artist Elizabeth Gould. Four subspecies have been described: * A. g. annamensis (Robinson & Kloss,1919) * A. g. dabryii (J.Verreaux, 1867) * A. g. gouldiae (Vigors, 1831) (the nominate subspecies) * A. g. isolata (E.C.S.Baker, 1925) The species is regarded as closely related to the green-tailed sunbird. Description Mrs.Gould sunbird is a small sunbird. It has a down-curved and pointed beak, typical for a nectar feeder. The iris of the eye is usually deep brown, and the tarsus is black. The male Mrs.Gould's sunbird is bright and colourful. The forehead to crown, supercilium and throat of the sunbird is deep violet. The lore, the auriculars and the malar region, the nape, mantle and side is bright red to deep scarlet. Bright blue patterns may present on the auricular and the side. The coverts and wingbars to the primary feathers are brown or olive green. The belly and vent are yellowish-green. The covert tail covert is blight blue and fades to dark purple at the tip of the tail. The female is dull in colour compare to the male. The female is cover by deep olive green on the dorsal side and the greyish-yellow on the ventral side. The colour and pattern may differential in different subspecies. For example, the breast of A. g. dabryii is purely scarlet, and A. g. gouldiae has a bright yellow breast, with or without a red stripe. The male weighs 4-12 g and measures 131-160 mm. Wing length is 51-58 mm, tail length is 64-88mm, and the tarsus is 13-15.5 mm in length. The female weighs 5-8 g and is between 91-111 mm in length. The wing is 45-54. The tail is 30.5-40 mm in length, and the tarsus is 12-16 mm in length. Both sexes have a beak 13-17 mm in length.  Distribution and habitat  Mrs. Gould's sunbird is widely distributed in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, India, Vietnam and Southern China.. It is found in the evergreen broad-leaved forest, monsoon forest and deciduous broad-leaved forest at 1000-3500 m above sea-level. It is also occasionally found in orchards and bamboo forest within its range. There is a non-breeding population in Hong Kong..= Ecology  Diet  As a typical sunbird, Mrs. Gould's sunbird feeds on nectar. The elongated and tubular tongue is modified for sucking the nectar for tube-shape flowers. It also takes small invertebrates. Diet in Sichuan and Yunnan was found to include spiders, small beetles and hemipteran nymphs.  Behaviour  Mrs. Gould's sunbird is generally resident but may undertake small-scale seasonal migrations. It is usually seen solitary or in pairs although temporary groups of 3-5 or even more than 10 individuals can form. It moves quickly and flies for short distances. Calls include a high thin \\"tzeeee\\" and sharp \\"tzit\\".  Reproduction  The breeding period of Mrs. Gould's sunbird is April to June. Females nest around mid-April. The nest is built of moss, grass, plant fibers and spiderwebs. It is 15-18 cm long and 10-11.5 cm wide, and usually build in deciduous board-leaved forest at 1000-3000m above sea level. In the breeding season, the males court the females sunbird with a mating call 'zhai-zhai- zhai'. Clutch size is 2-3 eggs, 13.5-15.3 mm x 10.5-11.5 mm in size. The eggs are white and usually have reddish brown spots. Incubation lasts for about 2 weeks, and chicks fledge after 15-16 days. In this period, both parents care for the chicks. The adults feed nectar to the young chicks by regurgitation at the beginning; later on invertebrates are increasingly provided.  Conservation  The species is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List. Mrs. Gould's sunbird is not on the list of endangered and protected species of China. However, it is on the List of Wild Animal that Protected by PRC with Beneficial and High Value of Economy and Science.

Originally from Muskogee, Oklahoma, he has retired to Durham, North Carolina after a long residence in Richardson, Texas. In 2002, he was inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame. Personal During World War II, Mercer served in the United States Navy from 1943-1946 aboard the USS Rixie and USS LCI(G)‚Äì439 (Landing Craft Infantry ‚Äì Gunboat) as a Signalman. Mercer's ships participated in five invasions: Marshall Islands, Guam, Leyte, Luzon and Okinawa. Mercer first attended college at Northeastern State College in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, after the war. He then earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Denver in 1949 and a master's degree from North Texas State University in Denton, Texas in 1966. Career Mercer is best known as a play-by-play radio announcer for baseball, football, basketball and wrestling. He was also a news reporter for Dallas, Texas, television station KRLD, covering the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963. He and fellow reporters George Phenix, Wes Wise and Bob Huffaker wrote, When the News Went Live, about their experiences during that time. Mercer also wrote, Play-by-Play: Tales from a Sportscasting Insider, about his experiences in sportscasting. He enjoyed a stint as a sports anchor at KVIL radio station in Dallas-Fort Worth during the 1970s and 80s, alongside longtime morning host Ron Chapman. Mercer also spent over 35 years teaching new generations of sports broadcasters in the University of North Texas's Radio/TV Department. He was also recognized by the University of Texas at Dallas Athletic Department for his involvement with their live game broadcasts. Play by Play In his 60+ year career, Mercer provided play-by-play broadcasting for several minor league teams: First, the Muskogee Giants of the Class C Western Association, then the Dallas Rangers (Triple A baseball) from 1959‚Äì64, and the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs (Texas League baseball) from 1965 to 1971. He then moved up to broadcast for major league baseball's Texas Rangers (major league baseball) in 1972 (with Don Drysdale) and Chicago White Sox in 1974. Mercer also provided play-by-play for University of North Texas (known as North Texas State College until 1961, and North Texas State University from 1961 to 1988) football and basketball from 1959 to 1994. Mercer's first broadcasts for professional teams began with the Dallas Texans (American Football League) in 1960 with Charlie Jones, then for the Dallas Cowboys (National Football League) from 1966 to 1971. Initially, Mercer provided color commentary with Jay Randolph in 1965 for the Cowboys, then became the play-by-play announcer when Randolph moved to St. Louis the following year. In the 1980s, Mercer broadcast Southwest Conference football and basketball for Mutual Radio. In the 2000s, he assisted Mike Capps with play-by-play for Round Rock Express minor league baseball of the Texas League (currently in the Pacific Coast League,) and for three years with Scott Garner of the Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League. While at KRLD-AM/TV in Dallas, he served seven years as color commentator for CBS Radio's annual broadcasts of the Cotton Bowl Classic college football game. Mercer is also noted for calling the \\"Ice Bowl,\\" the NFL championship game between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers in 1967, along with the Cowboys' second Super Bowl appearance in January, 1972. During his time at UNT, he called games involving Kevin Adkisson and Steve Williams, who both became professional wrestlers under the names Kevin Von Erich and Stone Cold Steve Austin, respectively. He also was the announcer in 1959 at UNT when Abner Haynes broke the color line in Texas and later became a star with the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans (American Football League). Wrestling Mercer provided play-by- play announcing for the internationally acclaimed World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW,) based in Dallas, from 1982-87. Telecasts were originally shown on Dallas-Fort Worth station KXTX, Channel 39. Mercer became a wrestling announcer in the 1950s in Muskogee, Oklahoma during the course of broadcasting all area sports for local radio station KMUS. By the late 1950s, Mercer had relocated to Dallas and began calling televised wrestling matches at the Dallas Sportatorium and in the studio for KRLD-TV (present day KDFW-TV,) Channel 4. In early 1976, Mercer took over announcing duties for the long- running Saturday Night Wrestling program on KTVT, Channel 11, in Fort Worth, when original announcer Dan Coates retired.

The idea is that process improvement should not interrupt production. EVOP is a process or technique of systematic experimentation. Evolutionary Operation (EVOP) is based on the understanding that every production lot has the ability to contribute valuable information on the effect of process variables on a particular product characteristic or feature. Typical methods used involve structured designs of experiments (DOE) which may result in interrupting production flow to conduct the trials or experiments. EVOP, on the other hand, is intended to introduce small changes in the process variables during normal production flow. These changes are not large enough to result in non- conforming product, but are significant enough to determine the optimum process ranges. Application Applicable virtually to any applied discipline. Optimization is addressed in all spheres of human enterprise from natural sciences and engineering of whatever discipline, through economics, econometrics, statistics and operations research to management science.

It is social and commonly seen in small groups. Unlike the \\"true\\" cowbirds in the genus Molothrus, this species is not a brood parasite. In contrast, the screaming cowbird is a brood parasite of the grayish baywing, and while adult screaming cowbirds are overall blackish, juvenile screaming cowbirds closely resemble grayish baywings. File:Agelaioides badius-standing.jpgthumbCostanera Sur, Argentina Habitat and status It is found in a wide range of semi-open habitats, including scrub and light woodland. It is generally fairly common, and consequently considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN. References * Ridgely, R. S.; & Tudor, G. (1989).

It is a fairly common bird and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it a \\"least-concern species\\". Description Male Female The male unicolored blackbird is befitting of its name, with entirely glossy black plumage and dark eyes. However, the species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is streaked brown and black with a yellow belly streaked with brown. The face has a dark mask and the wings are reddish-brown edged with black. Females from the lower Amazon region and southeastern Brazil have a generally duller colouration with less rufous wings and less yellow underparts.

Description  Catbirds are characterize by ivory-colored bill with the hooked maxilla, large head, green dorsal plumage, ventral spotting, powerful grasping claws and fig-eating habit. In contrast to the other genera within the Ptilonorhynchidae family, all of the Ailuroedus catbirds lack marked sexual dimorphism, are pair bonded, monogamous breeders, with both parents caring for the offspring. They form pair bonds in which the male helps to build the nest, and have simple arboreal chasing displays, without bowers or stages.

His mature works include both brightly colored landscape paintings and dark, finely drawn portraits and figures. One of the major American painters of the late 19th century,Hirshler, page 16. and a friend of many prominent artists of the era, Bunker died from meningitis at the age of 29. Life Bunker was born in New York City to Matthew Bunker, the secretary-treasurer of the Union Ferry Company, and his wife, Mary Anne Eytinge Bunker (sister of illustrator Sol Eytinge Jr.). In 1876 he enrolled at the Art Students League of New York and the National Academy of Design. By 1880 he was participating in the annual exhibitions of the National Academy, the American Watercolor Society, and the Brooklyn Art Association. In 1881 Bunker exhibited a watercolor at the Boston Art Club. He subsequently exhibited both oil paintings and watercolors at the Club in 1882 and 1883. In 1886, the American printmaker Louis Prang exhibited two of Bunker's works from his own collection at the Club. In 1882 Bunker left New York to study at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, most notably with Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. In the spring of 1883, accompanied by fellow students Charles A. Platt and Kenneth R. Cranford, Bunker left Paris to travel through the French countryside and the coast of Normandy, returning to continue his studies in mid-October. The following year the three artists summered and painted in Brittany. By year's end Bunker had returned to New York City. In 1885 Bunker was elected to the Society of American Artists. In October of that year, at the recommendation of James Carroll Beckwith, he moved to Boston to teach at the Cowles Art School, where he was the chief instructor of figure and cast drawing, artistic anatomy, and composition. He lived and taught in the art school building. Concurrently Bunker was given his first solo exhibition, at Noyes and Blakeslee Gallery in Boston. Despite these successes, Bunker was homesick for France, and wrote of feeling \\"supremely ridiculous\\" in \\"this atmosphere of wealth and respectability\\".Hirshler, page 172. While meager finances prevented him from staying in Boston during the summer, let alone traveling to Europe, Bunker did accept an invitation from Abbott Handerson Thayer to join him and paint in South Woodstock, Connecticut in 1886. In that year he also met Isabella Stewart Gardner, who would prove to be a valuable friend and patron. Bunker painted portraits during the winter of 1887, and spent the summer in Newburyport, Massachusetts with artist friends; including Henry Oliver Walker. In November he met John Singer Sargent in Boston, during the latter's first working trip to America. In 1888 Bunker undertook a number of portrait commissions of important Bostonians, including members of the Gardner family, Samuel Endicott Peabody, and J. Montgomery Sears. Bunker spent the summer in England, where he joined Sargent and his family in Calcot, painting during the day and playing tennis in the evening. Medfield, 1889. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. During the spring of 1889 Bunker resigned from the Cowles Art School. At a reception he met Eleanor Hardy, whom he would marry the following year. In the summer Bunker stayed at a boarding house in Medfield, Massachusetts, and enjoyed his most productive season of painting. In the fall he returned to New York, writing daily to Hardy in Boston. By this time, Bunker's circle of friends included not only Sargent, Gardner, and Platt, but Thomas Wilmer Dewing, William Merritt Chase, Stanford White, William Dean Howells, Charles Martin Loeffler, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, as well. In 1890 Bunker first exhibited his impressionist landscapes at the St. Botolph Club in Boston. He received an offer to teach at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and planned to take over William Merritt Chase's class in Brooklyn that winter. In June he visited the art colony at Cornish, New Hampshire, and in July returned to paint further at Medfield. On October 2 Bunker married Eleanor Hardy in Boston. The couple then moved to New York. Returning to Boston to celebrate Christmas with the Hardy family, Bunker fell ill. On December 28 he died of heart failure, probably caused by cerebro- spinal meningitis. He was Buried at Milton Cemetery, Milton, MA and his tombstone was designed by his friends Stanford White and Augustus Saint- Gaudens. Platt and other friends organized a memorial exhibition at the St. Botolph Club, held in 1891. Work The paintings of Bunker's early maturity in New York (ca. 1880-82) were often marine subjects, featuring a series of beached boats, painted on Long Island. In these he followed the standard academic practice of first painting loose, preparatory sketches (Beached, ca. 1881-2) prior to more conventionally finished exhibition pieces. The early portraits (Portrait of Walter Griffin, 1881, Portland Museum of Art) also evidence rigorous craftsmanship. While studying in Paris, Bunker's summer excursions to the countryside resulted in another series, this time of scenes of Larmor, a town in Brittany. The focus of these compositions, be it church spire (Brittany Town Morning, Larmor, 1884, Terra Foundation for American Art), cemetery cross, or a lone tree (Tree, 1884-5, private collection), was invariably that of a richly painted, dark graphic shape against a bright sky. Nevertheless, the pictures are characterized by soft atmospheric effects and tonal subtlety. No less subtle are the landscapes Bunker painted after returning to America; paintings done in South Woodstock, Connecticut (Pines Beyond the Fence, 1886, private collection) still favor dramatic value contrasts, with subjects carefully painted against a light sky, but the palette has grown lighter, the color more saturated.Hirshler, page 44. By 1887 Bunker completed his Portrait of Anne Page, a painting requiring much labor, but one of his most poignant works.Hirshler, page 46. In its restrained use of color, delicate modeling of form, and aesthetic elegance it is reminiscent of the works of Thayer and James McNeill Whistler. There soon followed the Boston commissions, portraits mostly of male sitters‚Äîstill somber in tone, they are painted in a more confident manner, suggesting the influence of Sargent (Portrait of George Augustus Gardner, 1888, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Portrait Sketch of Eleanor Hardy Bunker, 1890. Private collection. That Bunker spent the summer of 1888 painting with Sargent is verified by personal correspondence, as well as through several pieces by the latter artist (Dennis Miller Bunker Painting at Calcot, 1888, Terra Foundation for American Art), but no paintings of the English sojourn by Bunker have survived; possibly he destroyed them in dissatisfaction.Hirshler, pages 55-6. However, once back in Boston the experience came to fruition, for over the next two years Bunker produced a series of canvases which evidenced that he was one of the first American artists to fully understand and successfully practice impressionism.Hirshler, page 59. In the Greenhouse, ca. 1888, Chrysanthemums, 1888 (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), The Pool, Medfield, 1889 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), and Meadow Lands, 1890 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) all feature a rich palette, vertiginous compositions, and his unique \\"fish hook\\" shaped brush strokes.The description was coined by Edmund Tarbell. Hirshler, page 67. Jessica, 1890. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston At the same time, Bunker's last figure pieces remained faithful to his academic training. Jessica, 1890 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), The Mirror, 1890 (Terra Foundation for American Art), and Eleanor Hardy Bunker, 1890 (Metropolitan Museum of Art) are characterized by a restricted color range and heightened elegance. Legacy Although highly regarded during his lifetime, the 20th century assessment of American Impressionism was largely negative, and Bunker's work was all but forgotten soon after his death. His teachings influenced a number of painters (upon his resignation from the Cowles school, his students wrote a letter of appreciation, urging him to reconsider),Hirshler, page 175. among whom were William McGregor Paxton and Lilla Cabot Perry. It was a student of Paxton's named R. H. Ives Gammell who did the most to maintain Bunker's reputation, organizing two exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in the 1940s, and publishing a biography in 1953. The current revival of interest in his work is the result of a less programmatic reassessment of 19th century art: > Thus, depending upon the viewpoint of the writer, Bunker can be seen as > either a traditionalist or an innovator. In truth, he was both.Hirshler, > page 19. Notes References * Hirshler, Erica E., et al., Dennis Miller Bunker: American Impressionist, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1994.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. From Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh. Taxonomy When Edward Blyth first described the golden-breasted fulvetta in 1845, from a written description provided by naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson of a specimen collected in Nepal, he gave it the scientific name Proparus chrysotis. Most ornithologists kept it in that genus until 1889, when Eugene William Oates created the genus Lioparus and named the golden-breasted fulvetta as its type species and sole member. He moved the species out of the genus Proparus because it had a broader bill, much longer , bristles hanging over the nostrils, and smaller hind claws than other species in the genus. There are six recognized subspecies: *L. c. chrysotis, the nominate subspecies, is found from central Nepal east to northeastern India (western Arunachal Pradesh) and adjacent southern China (southeastern Xizang). This has a grey chin and throat with silvery white tips to the feathers, a coal grey head and either lacking or having a narrow white median crown or coronal stripe. Some Sikkim specimens have a grey coronal stripe. *L. c. albilineatus, described by Walter Koelz in 1954, is found in Assam, Nagaland and Manipur in northeastern India. Said to have a prominent white coronal stripe and brighter plumage. *L. c. forresti, described by Walter Rothschild in 1926, is found in northeastern Myanmar and northwestern Yunnan (in southern China). They have the coronal stripe made up of white spots which are yellowish towards the nape. It is named after the collector of the type specimen, George Forrest. *L. c. swinhoii, described by Jules Pierre Verreaux in 1871, is found in China from southeastern Gansu, southern Shaanxi and central Sichuan south to Guangxi, southeastern Hunan and northern Guangdong. *L. c. amoenus, described by Ernst Walter Mayr in 1941, is found in southeastern Yunnan and Tonkin in northwestern Vietnam. *L. c. robsoni, described by J. C. Eames in 2002, is found in central Vietnam. It has a yellow throat and chin, an off-white central crown stripe and olive-grey ear coverts. Description The golden- breasted fulvetta is a small bird, measuring in length with a mass between . The head and crown are black or grey and the black wings have orange-yellow slashes. The secondaries are tipped white and brown tail has two thirds of the base edged in orange yellow. The underparts are predominantly yellow and the throat may be grey or yellowish depending on the populations. The presence, prominence and colour of the median crown stripe varies with populations. The sexes are indistinguishable by plumage. Range and habitat The golden- breasted fulvetta is found from central Nepal through Bhutan, northern India and Myanmar to western China and northern Vietnam. It is an altitudinal migrant, moving from breeding grounds at to foothills as low as , and occasionally down to , in the winter. Golden-breasted fulvettas are found in broad-leaved evergreen forests and montane bamboo where they forage at a low height for insects, moving in groups of as many as 30 individuals in winter, and often join mixed-species foraging flocks. Conservation and threats The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the golden- breasted fulvetta as a species of least concern. Although its population has not been quantified and is thought to be declining, the decline is not thought to be precipitous, and its overall range is vast. In recent times, there has been growing pressure on some populations, with people collecting them as a food source or as pets. Several species of feather mite have been described from specimens of the golden-breasted fulvetta including Timalinyssus grallator, Neocalcealges chrysotis, Anhemialge lioparus and Resartor extraneus from China.

He first appeared in Web of Spider-Man #117 (October 1994). He was created by writer Terry Kavanagh and artist Steven Butler. Character development Judas Traveller was introduced in the infamous Clone Saga. The character's agenda was to analyze the true nature of evil. Taking interest in Spider-Man and his clone, Traveller with his ally Scrier and his Host (a group of 4 of his students) pit Spider-Man both teaming and against his clone in a test of motivation. He was described by Spider-Man writer Glenn Greenberg as a deus ex machina character with ill-defined powers: \\"no one ‚Äì not the writers, not the editors ‚Äì seemed to know who or what the heck Judas Traveller was. He was seemingly this immensely powerful, quasi- mystical being with amazing abilities, but what was the real deal with him? ... But to be honest, a character like Traveller didn't really fit into Spider-Man's world.\\"Life of Reilly, Part 1As such, Traveller's role would remain a mystery to readers for a while, as writers dropped him in and out of this saga. It was eventually revealed that all Traveller knew about himself was a lie. In reality he was a criminal psychologist who suffered a mental breakdown awakening his dormant mutant powers to alter perception. With these abilities he often appeared far more powerful than he really was. This was the truth that Chakra told Ben Reilly. During this story, Judas was betrayed by the Scrier, and rescued by Ben Reilly, and his own love interest, Chakra.http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/417.html He was a pawn of Norman Osborn against Spider-Man and eventually betrayed by Osborn.Amazing Spider-Man #417(Nov. 1996) Fictional character biography The Past Traveller is a creature who has walked the planet for ages, seeking the true meaning of evil and how it manifests within men. His memories are filled with past events which he witnessed and studied in order to understand the human soul. He eventually set his sights on studying Spider- Man, as he could not yet comprehend if Spider-Man was the cause of evil re- presenting itself in his enemies or a beacon of good that would stand against evil. Aftershocks Traveller appears during the Clone Saga, infatuated with understanding every minute detail of Peter Parker's life. He is seen with a \\"Host,\\" four people who are supposed to aid him in his journey of study (Medea, Mister Nacht, Boone, and Chakra), and Scrier (an enigmatic being who is seen as Traveller's confidante and has been with him through the ages). During this time, Parker's life is in disarray due to the passing of Aunt May, the charges of murder levied against him, and the potentially problematic pregnancy of his wife Mary Jane. Traveller struggles to understand what drives Parker to continue on this path of seeking justice when most men would have broken under the stress. He approaches a stressed Mary Jane in an attempt to search her soul for answers, but Ben Reilly relentlessly fights past all of Traveller's obstacles in order to keep him out of her life. Seeing Reilly's resolve, Traveller agrees to leave her alone, but he also mentions that he has just as much interest in Reilly and would seek him out eventually. The Mark of Kaine While Parker is imprisoned for crimes committed between Utah and New York, Traveller sends Chakra to inform him that Mary Jane is being stalked by Kaine. He watches to see what Parker will choose to do, and eventually aids him by allowing Parker safe escape from prison and casting an illusion of Parker remaining in his cell. While Traveller admits to Scrier that both Parker and Reilly fascinate him, he assures him that not even Scrier is able to understand why. Crossfire After Parker and Reilly switch places in prison and Parker dons the Scarlet Spider costume, Traveller follows him around the city and eventually confronts him, places Mary Jane unconscious, and gives Parker a choice to make his life better. He shows Peter the image of Aunt May in a crystal ball and suggests that he could bring her back to life and give Parker a world where he no longer has to worry about the clones or the charges now against Reilly. Parker refuses and fights back Traveller, claiming that everything is taking place in his mind, Traveller is not God and doesn't have the power to restore lives. Traveller responds by showing Parker a world twenty-four hours in the future, a destroyed city supposedly the result of Parker's actions. He claims that Parker can still stop this world from coming to pass if he can stop his Host from going through with their plans. As part of this test, Traveller agrees to use his powers to protect the building where Mary Jane is so no matter what happens she and the unborn child would be safe. Parker goes after the Host and manages to stop them from going through with their plan, but another anomaly arises from the point of origin where Traveller used his powers to show Parker the future. His misuse of that power causes a rift in the space-time continuum that attempts to correct itself through Traveller who can no longer control his powers. While Scrier refuses to help, Parker decides to pull Traveller from the rift before he causes the destroyed future he had witnessed only minutes earlier. Upon saving him, Scrier gathers an unconscious Traveller and leaves after telling Parker that Traveller would not be satisfied with the turn of events. The Trial of Peter Parker While Parker (back in his original Spider-Man garb) fights Kaine in an attempt to clear his name, Traveller interrupts their fight to place them in a different trial. He teleports them to a sub-basement beneath Ravencroft and forces both of them into a \\"trial\\" where Spider-Man is charged for his entire life as a superhero, questioning that if Spider-Man no longer existed would his superpowered enemies have a reason to exist. He chooses Carnage to be the prosecuting attorney (which allows him to have knowledge of Spider-Man's true identity), Kaine the defense attorney, and a number of Ravencroft inmates to be the jury. Kaine attacks Traveller and attempts to leave his \\"mark\\" on his face, but Traveller is unaffected and displays his power by holding Kaine in the palm of his hand. He lets the brief trial unfold the only way that it could, with all supervillains wanting Spider-Man dead. Traveller binds Spider-Man and allows the supervillains, led by Carnage, to carry out Spider-Man's death sentence. Kaine, however, jumps into the fray, determined to protect Spider-Man's life at any cost. Before Kaine could be killed by the mob, Traveller disperses the entire group and returns them to their cells as he had gotten the answer he wanted. The entire ordeal had only been to see how Spider-Man's actions (or lack thereof in this case) could motivate the actions of someone as corrupt as Kaine. As a result, he returns Spider-Man and Kaine to their previous place of battle, saying that his current investigation had been concluded for the time being. As his last act of ending the trial, he removed Spider-Man's secret identity from the minds of Carnage and all those who were previously aware.

It is monotypic within the genus Alopochelidon. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Falkland Islands, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, where its natural habitats are dry savanna and subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland. Taxonomy and etymology This swallow was originally described as Hirundo fucata by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1822. The current genus, Alopochelidon, was created in 1903 by Robert Ridgway. Although no subspecies of the tawny- headed swallow have been defined, it is known that, in general, the tawny- headed swallow differs slightly depending on where it occurs. A tawny-headed swallow that occurs in the southern part of its range will usually have a duskier cap, less distinct margins of the crown feathers, and will usually be slightly larger than those of northern populations. Although this is true, birds from both the northern and southern portion of its range overlap in size and characteristics. This fact means that there are most likely no subspecies. This swallow is also monotypic within its genus, Alopochelidon. Description This swallow is relatively small, usually measuring and weighing . It has a black bill that usually measures . It has a mostly brownish-black crown, with tawny-rufous edges. It also has a tawny-rufous coloured forehead, eyebrow, and hindcrown, which transition into its cinnamon- buff ear coverts, sides of the head, throat, and breast. It has dark brown lores and brown irides. The rest of the upperparts are a gray-brown, with a paler rump. The wings and almost square tail are dark brown, and the underparts are a dull white with pale gray-brown sides. The juvenile can be differentiated by the fact that its head is more buff and less rufous and its feathers are tinged buff rather than rufous. The tawny-headed swallow makes use of a flight call described as a soft trilled treeeeb. Distribution This swallow is native to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela and vagrant to Chile and the Falkland Islands. The tawny-headed swallow is split up into 2 resident populations, one in southeast Venezuela, and the other in central and southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, all of Paraguay except the Northwest portion of it, and northeast Argentina. It also occurs in Uruguay and part of central Argentina as a resident during the breeding season. It is not known where this population migrates, although there have been sightings of non-breeding tawny-headed swallows in eastern Colombia and southeastern Peru. This swallow can be found in open and mostly open tropical and subtropical areas, especially near small bodies of water, forest clearings near streams, and in pampas. It can also be found in wet or flooded areas of open grassland. It usually resides at altitudes up to . Behaviour Breeding The nest of the tawny-headed swallow is cup-shaped and made of leaves, feathers, and straw. It usually measures in length and in width. The nest usually has a diameter of around , a depth of , and a height of . The nest is constructed by both the male and female, usually over a period of 10 or 12 days. The nest can be found in hidden holes along rivers, streams, and ditches. The holes are usually at least deep, with a compartment at the end, where the nest is placed. Further research is required to determine whether this bird digs its own burrow or whether it steals tunnels from other species. The tawny-headed swallow usually nests in pairs or loose groups. The breeding season of the northern population is suspected to occur during May and June, although it is not particularly well-known. The southern population's breeding season occurs from September to November. Other than this information, nothing is known about when its breeding season occurs. The tawny-headed swallow, in Argentina, at least, has a clutch of four to five white eggs. The eggs measure and weigh, on average, . Diet This swallow subsists on a diet of insects, primarily beetles, flies, and hymenopterans. It usually forages in pairs and small groups, although larger groups, up to 100 individuals, have been recorded when not in the breeding season. Although it is usually not seen with other swallows, it has been seen with wintering barn swallows.

In 1962 the party became the Queensland section of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The party continued to hold seats in the Queensland state parliament until 1972, then suffered a collapse in its vote and wound itself up in 1978. History In Queensland, Vince Gair became Labor leader and premier in 1952. The Central Executive of the ALP expelled Gair on 24 April 1957 because of his support of the Groupers. A total of 25 Labor MLAs left the party with him, including all the Cabinet except Deputy Premier Jack Duggan, to form the Queensland Labor Party. The two ex-Labor Independents joined the QLP. The ALP was left with 23 members with Duggan as leader. The Country and Liberal Parties had a combined 24 seats. Gair tried to gain Country Party support for his minority government, but talks with Frank Nicklin broke down when federal Country Party leader Arthur Fadden (himself a Queenslander) told Nicklin that he had a chance to become Premier himself. On 12 June, the ALP, now led by Duggan, voted to deny \\"supply\\" (that is, the money needed to govern) to what was left of the Gair government. The Country-Liberal Coalition moved to block supply as well and brought the government down.Frank Mines (1975), Gair, Canberra City, ACT, Arrow Press. A state election was called for 3 August 1957. At that time, Queensland had a unicameral parliament which was elected by first-past- the-post rather than the present preferential voting system. Since all sitting ALP and QLP members were opposed by a candidate from the other faction, the Labor vote was split in many seats. While the Coalition actually suffered a small swing against it, the large number of three-cornered contests resulted in the ALP and QLP losing seats to the Coalition. The two Labor factions won only 31 seats between them to the Coalition's 42 (up from 24 previously). The QLP won 23.4% of the vote, second behind Labor, and 11 of the 75 seats. Nicklin became Premier and for the first time in 25 years and only the second time since 1915, a Labor Government was out of office in Queensland. Gair himself was reelected in South Brisbane. At the 1960 state election, the QLP won only four seats, with even Gair losing his seat. Gair stood for the Senate in 1961 for the QLP, but was unsuccessful. Gair's QLP merged with the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) in 1962 to become the Queensland branch of the DLP. However this decision split the state parliamentarians with two, Bunny Adair and Ted Walsh, opposing joining the DLP and instead becoming independent members. At the 1963 state election preferential voting was reintroduced. This enabled the DLP to not only draw votes away from the ALP, but also to direct their preferences to the Coalition. Gair became federal DLP leader in 1964, after his election to the Senate. From the 1963 election, the party's support in Queensland slipped below 8%, and the party retained only one seat in Queensland's unicameral parliament. The party's electoral support remained at about that level until the 1972 election when its last seat was lost in a redistribution. The DLP lost its raison d'√™tre after 1972 when Labor won office at the federal level. At the time the state Country Party explored a merger with the DLP as part of a strategy of seeking greater unity with groups opposed to the federal Labor government, but this plan was soon abandoned. The DLP went into further decline in 1974 when Gair was forced to resign from the party as a result of the so-called Gair Affair. At the 1974 state election, the DLP did not contest all seats, and recorded only 1.91% of the vote. The DLP did not contest the 1977 state election and ceased to exist in 1978. The ALP would remain in opposition in Queensland, even after the QLP and its successor the DLP had ceased to exist, returning to government in 1989 with Wayne Goss as leader. Queensland election results * In the 3 August 1957 Queensland election, the QLP won 23.4% of the vote, the second highest of the contesting parties, and won 11 seats in the Legislative Assembly. * At the 28 May 1960 election, the QLP's vote dropped significantly to 12.28% and won only 4 seats in the Legislative Assembly. * At the 1 June 1963 election the party's vote (now part of the DLP) had dropped further to 7.23% winning only 1 seat. * At the 28 May 1966 election, the DLP won 6.25% of the vote and 1 seat. * At the 17 May 1969 election, the DLP won 7.24% of the vote and 1 seat. * At the 27 May 1972 election, the DLP won 7.69% of the vote and no seat. * At the 7 December 1974 election, the DLP won 1.91% of the vote and no seat. * By the 1977 election, the DLP did not contest the election and had ceased to exist in 1978.

It comprises the monotypic genus Amblyospiza and subfamily Amblyospizinae. They have particularly strong mandibles, which are employed to extricate the seeds in nutlets and drupes, and their songs are comparatively unmusical and harsh. Their colonial nests are readily distinguishable from those of other weavers, due to their form and placement, and the fine strands used in their construction. They habitually fan and flick their tails. Taxonomy and systematics The generic name Amblyospiza was coined by Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1850 and means \\"blunt, finch\\", referencing the very large bill, while the specific name albifrons refers white forehead of the males. The thick-billed weaver was formally described as Pyrrhula albifrons in 1831 by the Irish zoologist and politician Nicholas Aylward Vigors from the collection of Henry Ellis, the specimens of which were attributed to Algoa Bay and environs in the Eastern Cape.

Thick- billed weavers breed in reedy wetlands and can be found around forest edge outside the breeding season. Behaviour and ecology  Breeding  Thick- billed weavers are polygynous, in that a single male attempts to attract and mate with several females. A male may attract up to six females, and up to three nests may be active in any male's territory at once. When found at low density there are many apparently monogamous pairs, but they normally nest in small colonies. More than 100 nests have been counted in one South African colony. After mating the female normally will lay a clutch of 3 whitish pink eggs, spotted with red, purple and brown. The incubation of the eggs is carried out solely by the female. This lasts 14 to 16 days and the chicks are fed by regurgitation by the female until they fledge, though occasionally the male may also feed the young. The chicks fledge after about 18 to 20 days in the nest. The nests are vulnerable to predation and recorded nest predators include the white-browed coucal, house crow and the Nile monitor. After the nests have been used by the weavers they may be commandeered by climbing mice, or used for breeding by the orange-breasted waxbill or brown firefinch.  Nests  The thick-billed weaver constructs a distinctive nest which is compact, woven with thin strips of reeds and hung between the upright stems of reeds. It is globe-shaped with the entrance (unlike other weaver nests) near the top and facing to the side. The male weaves the nest with fine material leaving a neat impression, but the weave is in fact not as complex or developed as that of other weaver species. The initial entrance is large, but when a female has chosen the nest the entrance reduced to a narrow opening. Thick-billed weaver colonies may involve a single male, or may contain several males, and is usually established in a reed swamp.

Examples include Boolean algebras with the monoid taken to be conjunction, the set of all formal languages over a given alphabet Œ£ under concatenation, the set of all binary relations on a given set X under relational composition, and more generally the power set of any equivalence relation, again under relational composition. The original application was to relation algebras as a finitely axiomatized generalization of the binary relation example, but there exist interesting examples of residuated Boolean algebras that are not relation algebras, such as the language example. Definition A residuated Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure (L, ‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨, 0, 1, ‚Ä¢, I, \\\\, /) such that : (i) (L, ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚Ä¢, I, \\\\, /) is a residuated lattice, and :(ii) (L, ‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨, 0, 1) is a Boolean algebra. An equivalent signature better suited to the relation algebra application is (L, ‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨, 0, 1, ‚Ä¢, I, ‚ñ∑, ‚óÅ) where the unary operations x\\\\ and x‚ñ∑ are intertranslatable in the manner of De Morgan's laws via :x\\\\y = ¬¨(x‚ñ∑¬¨y), x‚ñ∑y = ¬¨(x\\\\¬¨y), and dually /y and ‚óÅy as : x/y = ¬¨(¬¨x‚óÅy), x‚óÅy = ¬¨(¬¨x/y), with the residuation axioms in the residuated lattice article reorganized accordingly (replacing z by ¬¨z) to read :(x‚ñ∑z)‚àßy = 0 ‚áî (x‚Ä¢y)‚àßz = 0 ‚áî (z‚óÅy)‚àßx = 0 This De Morgan dual reformulation is motivated and discussed in more detail in the section below on conjugacy. Since residuated lattices and Boolean algebras are each definable with finitely many equations, so are residuated Boolean algebras, whence they form a finitely axiomatizable variety. Examples # Any Boolean algebra, with the monoid multiplication ‚Ä¢ taken to be conjunction and both residuals taken to be material implication x‚Üíy. Of the remaining 15 binary Boolean operations that might be considered in place of conjunction for the monoid multiplication, only five meet the monotonicity requirement, namely 0, 1, x, y, and x‚à®y. Setting y = z = 0 in the residuation axiom y ‚â§ x\\\\z ‚áî x‚Ä¢y ‚â§ z, we have 0 ‚â§ x\\\\0 ‚áî x‚Ä¢0 ‚â§ 0, which is falsified by taking x = 1 when x‚Ä¢y = 1, x, or x‚à®y. The dual argument for z/y rules out x‚Ä¢y = y. This just leaves x‚Ä¢y = 0 (a constant binary operation independent of x and y), which satisfies almost all the axioms when the residuals are both taken to be the constant operation x/y = x\\\\y = 1. The axiom it fails is x‚Ä¢I = x = I‚Ä¢x, for want of a suitable value for I. Hence conjunction is the only binary Boolean operation making the monoid multiplication that of a residuated Boolean algebra. # The power set 2X¬≤ made a Boolean algebra as usual with ‚à©, ‚à™ and complement relative to X¬≤, and made a monoid with relational composition. The monoid unit I is the identity relation {(x,x)x ‚àà X}. The right residual R\\\\S is defined by x(R\\\\S)y if and only if for all z in X, zRx implies zSy. Dually the left residual S/R is defined by y(S/R)x if and only if for all z in X, xRz implies ySz. # The power set 2Œ£* made a Boolean algebra as for Example 2, but with language concatenation for the monoid. Here the set Œ£ is used as an alphabet while Œ£* denotes the set of all finite (including empty) words over that alphabet. The concatenation LM of languages L and M consists of all words uv such that u ‚àà L and v ‚àà M. The monoid unit is the language {Œµ} consisting of just the empty word Œµ. The right residual M\\\\L consists of all words w over Œ£ such that Mw ‚äÜ L. The left residual L/M is the same with wM in place of Mw. Conjugacy The De Morgan duals ‚ñ∑ and ‚óÅ of residuation arise as follows. Among residuated lattices, Boolean algebras are special by virtue of having a complementation operation ¬¨. This permits an alternative expression of the three inequalities :y ‚â§ x\\\\z ‚áî x‚Ä¢y ‚â§ z ‚áî x ‚â§ z/y in the axiomatization of the two residuals in terms of disjointness, via the equivalence x ‚â§ y ‚áî x‚àß¬¨y = 0. Abbreviating x‚àßy = 0 to x # y as the expression of their disjointness, and substituting ¬¨z for z in the axioms, they become with a little Boolean manipulation :¬¨(x\\\\¬¨z) # y ‚áî x‚Ä¢y # z ‚áî ¬¨(¬¨z/y) # x Now ¬¨(x\\\\¬¨z) is reminiscent of De Morgan duality, suggesting that x\\\\ be thought of as a unary operation f, defined by f(y) = x\\\\y, that has a De Morgan dual ¬¨f(¬¨y), analogous to ‚àÄxœÜ(x) = ¬¨‚àÉx¬¨œÜ(x). Denoting this dual operation as x‚ñ∑, we define x‚ñ∑z as ¬¨(x\\\\¬¨z). Similarly we define another operation z‚óÅy as ¬¨(¬¨z/y). By analogy with x\\\\ as the residual operation associated with the operation x‚Ä¢, we refer to x‚ñ∑ as the conjugate operation, or simply conjugate, of x‚Ä¢. Likewise ‚óÅy is the conjugate of ‚Ä¢y. Unlike residuals, conjugacy is an equivalence relation between operations: if f is the conjugate of g then g is also the conjugate of f, i.e. the conjugate of the conjugate of f is f. Another advantage of conjugacy is that it becomes unnecessary to speak of right and left conjugates, that distinction now being inherited from the difference between x‚Ä¢ and ‚Ä¢x, which have as their respective conjugates x‚ñ∑ and ‚óÅx. (But this advantage accrues also to residuals when x\\\\ is taken to be the residual operation to x‚Ä¢.) All this yields (along with the Boolean algebra and monoid axioms) the following equivalent axiomatization of a residuated Boolean algebra. :y # x‚ñ∑z ‚áî x‚Ä¢y # z ‚áî x # z‚óÅy With this signature it remains the case that this axiomatization can be expressed as finitely many equations. Converse In Examples 2 and 3 it can be shown that x‚ñ∑I = I‚óÅx. In Example 2 both sides equal the converse xÀò of x, while in Example 3, both sides are I when x contains the empty word and 0 otherwise. In the former case xÀò = x. This is impossible for the latter because x‚ñ∑I retains hardly any information about x. Hence in Example 2 we can substitute xÀò for x in x‚ñ∑I = xÀò = I‚óÅx and cancel (soundly) to give :xÀò‚ñ∑I = x = I‚óÅxÀò. xÀòÀò = x can be proved from these two equations. Tarski's notion of a relation algebra can be defined as a residuated Boolean algebra having an operation xÀò satisfying these two equations. The cancellation step in the above is not possible for Example 3, which therefore is not a relation algebra, xÀò being uniquely determined as x‚ñ∑I. Consequences of this axiomatization of converse include xÀòÀò = x, ¬¨(xÀò) = (¬¨x)Àò, (x ‚à® y)Àò = xÀò ‚à® yÀò, and (x‚Ä¢y)Àò = yÀò‚Ä¢xÀò.

First described by Johann Baptist von Spix in 1825, this American sparrow is found across much of the Amazon basin in South America. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, pastureland, and heavily degraded former forest. Taxonomy When Johann Baptist von Spix first described the yellow-browed sparrow in 1825, he put it in the now-defunct genus Tanagra, believing it to be a tanager. The classification error was soon recognized, and the species was moved first to the genus Ammodramus, then to Myospiza‚Äîa genus Robert Ridgway created in 1898 for this and the closely related grassland sparrow. Most taxonomists now subsume Myospiza into Ammodramus. DNA analysis indicates that the yellow-browed sparrow is a sister species to the grassland sparrow, and that these two species make a sister group with the grasshopper sparrow; these three are genetically distinct from the other Ammodramus sparrows. The yellow-browed sparrow has four subspecies, which differ primarily in the extent of yellow on the face and the amount of streaking on the upperparts and crown: *A. a. apurensis, first described by William Henry Phelps and Ernest Thomas Gilliard in 1941, is found in northeastern Colombia. *A. a. cherriei, first described by Frank Chapman in 1914, is found in central Colombia. *A. a. tenebrosus, first described by John Todd Zimmer and Phelps in 1949, ranges from southeastern Colombia through southwestern Venezuela into the adjacent areas of Brazil. *A. a. aurifrons, described by Spix in 1825, ranges south from southeastern Colombia into central Bolivia and east along the Amazon basin to the Atlantic coast. The yellow-browed sparrow is one of nine sparrows in the genus Ammodramus, a name which means \\"desert runner\\" or \\"desert racer\\" (from the Greek ammos, meaning \\"desert\\" and -dromos, meaning \\"-racer\\" or \\"-runner\\").Jobling (2010), p. 45. The species name aurifrons is a combination of the Latin words auri, meaning \\"gold\\" and frons, meaning \\"forehead\\" or \\"front\\".Jobling (2010), p. 62. Description The yellow-browed sparrow is a small American sparrow, measuring in length, with a mass between . Sexes are similarly plumaged, though males average very slightly larger than females. The adult is brownish gray on the upperparts, with dusky streaks on the back. Its underparts are whitish, shading to grayish on the chest and buff on the flanks. Its legs are pinkish-brown, while the beak is horn-colored, with a darker culmen. Its iris is reddish brown. The juvenile, which has no yellow on its face or wings, is buffier than adults are, with thin brownish streaks on its breast and flanks. Similar species Although quite similar to the grassland sparrow, the yellow-browed sparrow typically shows more yellow on its face. It is overall paler and less streaked than the grassland sparrow, and lacks chestnut edges to its flight feathers. It is best told by its buzzy song, its less secretive behavior and less restrictive habitat preferences. Habitat and range Although its former habitat was largely along rivers and on islands, the yellow-browed sparrow is now widespread in grassy areas of the Amazon biome, including agricultural fields, roadsides and around towns. It is generally found in the lowlands, though it has been recorded to on the east side of the Andes, and regularly as high as ‚Äî and sometimes to ‚Äî in Ecuador. Behavior The yellow-browed sparrow is generally easier to see than its sister species is. It is less secretive, and is found in a wider range of grasslands. Food and feeding Like most American sparrows, the yellow- browed sparrow is largely granivorous, feeding on the seeds of native grasses and various introduced plants. It also eats insects, including larvae. It typically feeds on the ground. Breeding Breeding has been recorded between February and September. The yellow-browed sparrow builds a cup nest of dried grass lined with fine plant material. The nest is generally on the ground in a grass clump, though sometimes it is placed low in a shrub. The female lays 2‚Äì3 white eggs. Voice The yellow-browed sparrow's high- pitched song is described as \\"insect-like\\". Monotonous and buzzy, it is transcribed as tic, tzzz-tzzzzz, with the first note weak and short. The male sings throughout the day from a low, exposed perch. Conservation and threats Because of its very large range and apparently stable population, the yellow-browed sparrow has been designated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species of least concern. It is described as common throughout its range, though its numbers have not been quantified. This species has benefited from the clearing of rainforest for agriculture and cattle ranching; it is common in early successional fields.

It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are dry savannah, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, and pastureland. Description The grassland sparrow is a robust species with a large head and a short tail, with a total length of about . The wings are short and the legs fairly long. The upper parts are brownish-grey streaked with black. The breast and flanks are greyish-buff or pinkish-buff and the underparts are dull white.

Its typical habitat is tall savannah grassland, but it also inhabits pastureland and cerrado. It is present in lowland areas and at altitudes of up to , possibly higher in southern Venezuela. Behavior A \\"secretive\\" bird, this species feeds on the ground and flits away into the vegetation if disturbed. It can be observed when singing from an elevated perch, and feeds out in the open in the early morning and late evening. The diet consists of grass and other seeds, and small insects are also eaten, particularly during the breeding season. The nest is cup-shaped and built on the ground, with a runway through the foliage leading to it. Status The grassland sparrow is a common bird and has a very extensive range.

Home is best The fable tells how the king of the gods invited all the animals to his wedding but the tortoise never arrived. When asked why, her excuse was that she preferred her own home, so Zeus made her carry her house about forever after. That excuse in Greek was Œü·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ, Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ ·ºÑœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ, literally ‚Äòthe home you love is the best‚Äô. The fabulist then goes on to comment that ‚Äòmost people prefer to live simply at home than to live lavishly at someone else's‚Äô.Aesopica The saying became proverbial and was noticed as connected with the fable by Erasmus in his Adagia.III.iii.38 The earliest English version of such a proverb, emerging in the 16th century, echoes the comment on the fable: ‚ÄúHome is home, though it‚Äôs never so homely‚Äù.Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs The sentiment was eventually used as the second line in the popular song, ‚ÄúHome! Sweet Home!‚Äù (1823), which also features the equally proverbial ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place like home‚Äù in the chorus. The first recorder of the fable was Cercidas some time in the 3rd century BCE.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable Vol.3, Brill NL 2003, p.141 During the Renaissance it was retold in a Neo-Latin poem by Barth√©l√©my Aneau in his emblem book Picta Poesis (1552)Tecum Habita, French Emblems at Glasgow and by Pantaleon Candidus in his fable collection of 1604.Centum et Quinquaginta Fabulae, Fable 2 Later it appeared in idiomatic English in Roger L'Estrange‚Äôs Fables of Aesop (1692).Fable 182 Earlier, however, an alternative version of the story about the tortoise had been mentioned by the late 4th century CE author Servius in his commentary on Virgil's Aeneid. There it is a mountain nymph called Chelone (ŒßŒµŒªœéŒΩŒ∑, the Greek for tortoise) who did not deign to be present at the wedding of Zeus. The divine messenger Hermes was then sent to throw her and her house into the river, where she was changed into the animal now bearing her name.The Theoi article on Chelone In the late 15th century, the Venetian Laurentius Abstemius created a Neo-Latin variant on the fable which was subsequently added to their fable collections by both Gabriele FaernoFable 57 and by L'Estrange. It relates how, when the animals were invited to ask gifts of Zeus at the dawn of time, the snail petitioned for the ability to carry her home with her. Zeus asked if this would not be a troublesome burden, but the snail replied that she preferred this way of avoiding bad neighbours.Hecatomythium, 1490, fable 71 Another fable attributed to Aesop is being alluded to here, number 100 in the Perry Index. In that story, Momus criticized the divine invention of a house as a gift to mankind because it did not have wheels so as to avoid troublesome neighbours. What was once a divine punishment of the tortoise, Abstemius now reveals as a blessing bestowed.

Vocalisations Favaloro and McEvey described the call of the grey grasswren as a soft double-syllable note which the bird tweeted persistently. Joseph also noted that calls were given constantly over several minutes with a series of three or four high pitched metallic notes, sounding like pit-choo.Joseph, L. (1982).' A further population of the Grey Grasswren'. \\"Sunbird\\",51-53. Carpenter described the call as a high pitched sit-sit-sit.Carpenter, G. (2002) 'The Grey Grasswren on Cooper Creek South West Queensland'. Sunbird 32(2&3):52-55 Distribution and habitat The grey grasswren occupies a restrictive area of arid inland floodplains of central Australia. Sightings have occurred at the Bulloo Overflow in the New South Wales/Queensland border area, lower Cooper Creek, along the Kallakoopah anabranch of the Diamantina River and the overflow areas of lakes Machattie, Koolivoo and Mipea on Eyre Creek in South Australia. These birds frequent mainly floodplains of the above systems which contain areas dominated by lignum and cane grass on major drainage lines between resident sand dunes. In some swampy areas, a dense understory of spike-rush, channel millet, and sedges are present.Jaensch, R. and McFarland, D. (2002).'A population of Grey Grasswren Amytornis barbatus in the Diamantina Channel Country, Queensland'. Sunbird 32(2&3):56-61. The grey grasswren has also been known to occupy open vegetative areas well beyond the lignum swamps which are less subject to inundation during flood events. It appears that in drought years the grey grasswren occupies tall dense lignum as a refuse while in normal years it prefers other habitats. Hardy recorded significantly more captures in declared drought years than in normal years. Grey grasswren habitat During 2011, an extensive grey grasswren survey was conducted at Frome Swamp in New South Wales which had recently experienced substantial rainfall and resultant lignum and cane grass growth. Despite the use of exhaustive surveys using mist netting, playback, vocal and visual methods, no grey grasswrens were located.D Watson, in Litt. 19 November 2013 This result could suggest that the species may be nomadic, an observation previously made by Hardy arising from his surveys in 2002 and 2003 at another location.Hardy, J., W. (2010). 'Distribution, Status and Options for the Future Management of the Grey Grasswren \\"Amytornis barbatus barbatus\\" in New South Wales'. \\"Corella\\",34(2):25-35. Behavior and ecology Breeding The breeding behaviour of this species has not been extensively documented but it is thought that the species breeds in July/August usually after flooding or heavy rain.Beruldsen, G. (2003). Australian Birds their Nests and Eggs. G. Beruldsen Publisher. Queensland. However, Hardy recorded breeding during heavy drought conditions with no local surface water in the study area for at least seven years. The semi-domed nest is built in lignum or cane grass, between 30 and 75 cm above ground level. Favaloro and McEvey noted that the nest was a large well camouflaged nest, very loosely constructed from grass with a large opening on the side. Clutch size is thought to be two eggs with an average weight of 2.4 g. Egg color is dull, white speckled all over with nutmeg brown, nutmeg to reddish-brown or cinnamon brown markings. There is considerable colour variation between eggs within the nest and also between nests. The female is solely responsible for the incubation of the eggs which is estimated at 13 to 15 days. Both parents attend to the feeding of the hatchlings and no details are known of its breeding success.Australian Government. (2012). Amytornis barbatus barbatus-Grey Grasswren (Bullo). http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/public/publicspecies.pl? id=67065. Feeding The shape of the beak suggests that the grey grasswren's diet consists mainly of seed and an analysis of the gut content of a specimen confirmed the presence of mainly small seeds of different plants, two small ants and the remains of small Coleoptera. Hower, other researches have noted that insect larvae is the dominate food source supplemented by mature insects and water snails.New South Wales Department of Environment and Heritage. (2012). 'Grey Grasswren-profile'. http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10047. Age and population size Little is known about its life expectancy but research conducted at one of its prime lignum habitats found from capture/re- capture surveys that this bird reached at least three years of age in that study area. The population of the grey grasswren is highly variable and subject to 'boom and bust' conditions, depending on prevailing climate within its range in the arid interior. Based upon the capture/re-capture method undertaken by Hardy in drought conditions, the New South Wales population was estimated at 1600 birds or 0.2 per hectare. Extrapolation of this to reach an estimate of its Australian population should be viewed with caution due to its geographic range, seasonal and habitat variability. Status and conservation The grey grasswren is listed as threatened under the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act); it is listed as endangered under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 in New South Wales and in Queensland under the Nature Conservation Act 1992, while the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 lists the species as rare. The IUCN Red List rates it as a species of least concern. Future management Research on the grey grasswren is limited and there have been few recent studies into the ecology of this elusive bird. As it occupies specific habitats, the major threat is habitat degradation through overgrazing and trampling by cattle, rabbits, and feral pigs, predation by cats and invasive weeds. A dependence on lignum and associated plant groups also makes the species vulnerable to catastrophic events such as drought and fire. The consequences of climate change also need further consideration to ensure that the grey grasswren continues to exist in arid regions of central Australia through the preservation of suitable areas. New conservation area In June 2020 the Government of New South Wales acquired , or of private land for a new national park, when it purchased Narriearra station in the state‚Äôs far north-west. The area includes ‚Äúephemeral wetlands and landscapes‚Äù that had not previously been included in the state‚Äôs conservation areas. Together with the nearby Sturt National Park, there would be a nearly contiguous conservation area of about , which is twice the size of the Australian Capital Territory. The new property lies next to the Pindera Downs Aboriginal area, which is rich in cultural artefacts of Aboriginal Australians. It is the largest ever purchase of private land for conservation in the state. The Dingo Fence on the border with Queensland forms the northern boundary of the property. Nearly 90 percent of the grey grasswren's habitat lies within Narriearra Station, so this is a significant move towards protecting the bird. The Tibooburra Local Aboriginal Land Council has been invited to suggest a name for the new park.

Taxonomy and systematics  Amytornis is the only genus classified within the subfamily Amytornithinae, and form a separate clade than the related fairy-wrens and emu-wrens within the family Maluridae. The genus contains thirteen species, many of which are poorly known due to their secretive nature and remote and inaccessible habitat. Extant species The genus contains the following species: * Grey grasswren (Amytornis barbatus) * Black grasswren (Amytornis housei) * White-throated grasswren (Amytornis woodwardi) * Carpentarian grasswren (Amytornis dorotheae) * Short-tailed grasswren (Amytornis merrotsyi) * Rufous grasswren (Amytornis whitei) * Opalton grasswren (Amytornis rowleyi) * Striated grasswren (Amytornis striatus) * Eyrean grasswren (Amytornis goyderi) * Western grasswren (Amytornis textilis) * Thick-billed grasswren (Amytornis modestus) * Dusky grasswren (Amytornis purnelli) * Kalkadoon grasswren (Amytornis ballarae) Description Grasswrens are the largest members of the Australasian wren family, ranging from for the Eyrean grasswren to the white-throated grasswren. They generally have long tails and legs and short wings and are adapted for life foraging on the ground. The bill is typically shorter and narrower than the fairy-wrens and emu-wrens, which reflects the larger part that seeds play in their diet. The plumage of the grasswrens is cryptic, usually red, buff and brown patterned with white and black. Distribution and habitat Grasswrens are endemic to Australia. They inhabit remote arid or semi-arid regions of the continent in the interior and north. Species typically occupy small ranges as well. Most species of grasswrens inhabit habitat dominated by spinifex. They are often found in hilly areas dominated by rocks, which provides them with prey as well as shelter, particularly thermal shelter from extremes of heat or cold.

There are some minor differences between sexes, and between populations across the distribution. Illustration by John Gould and W. Hart Adult male The head is reddish with bold white streaks, neck and upper body dull to bright rufous-brown, streaked with fine dark and white lines. The face is mainly white except for the rufous forehead, white lores and a thin partial white eye-ring beneath the eye; and sometimes a rufous fore-supercilium. Black and white ear coverts separate the dark head parts from the off-white chin and throat. The tail is dark grey-brown with off-white shafts and light brown fringes. Upperwings are also dark grey-brown, but with prominent white shafts and narrow rufous-brown fringes to the secondary coverts and tertials; and fine light brown edges to the other remiges, producing rufous-brown patches when the wing is folded. The underbody is white with buff-brown wash on the flanks through to the legs and underside of tail. The bill is light grey to blue-grey with a darker grey culmen, and the iris is dark to olive-brown. The legs and feet are purplish to dark grey. Female Identical to males but the flanks are a brighter rufous-brown, and not as distinctly pale compared to the upperparts. The legs may be a slightly paler grey with stronger purplish tinge. Females are slightly smaller overall and have a finer bill. Nestling, fledgling and juvenile Nestlings are naked with dark grey down on the head and wings. The bare skin is mostly pink with dark blue-grey skin around the eyes. Newly fledged birds have lemon or yellow gape-flanges. Partial moult begins soon after fledging, producing similar patterns to adult male but upperparts are much duller and browner, with less distinct streaking and facial patterns. They are fluffier which can give a mottled appearance around the face and ear coverts. The eye is olive and the bill is light grey, lacking the dark culmen and brown tip seen in the adult male. In young birds the skull is not fully pneumatised.  Systematics and taxonomy  The Eyrean grasswren was originally described by John Gould in 1875, who named it Amytis goyderi. Gould assumed it was related to the western grasswren (A. textilis) due to similarities in plumage characters. During the 20th century, various authors placed it in clades derived from either A. textilis or A. striatus, considering it closely related to either A. modestus or A. striatus. With the development of molecular studies, it was found that A. goyderi belongs in a clade with A. ballarae and A. purnelli which appears to have evolved from a common ancestor with A. textilis. Evolutionary history There are two possible explanations for grasswren diversity in Central Australia: Either they originated there, or they colonised it. The close relationships between A. goyderi and other central taxa indicate that they arose there in the last 100000 years as glaciation events influenced the vegetation structures in Central Australia. A. goyderi is one of very few avian species to evolve in a minor ecological refuge. Distribution A. goyderi has a patchy, restricted distribution, found only in dune fields of the Simpson and Strzelecki deserts of Central Australia. These deserts are located in the Birdsville Structural Basin, an enormous drainage basin centring on Lake Eyre. Most populations are found in South Australia from north of Cameron Corner to Witjira National Park; with some in SW Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is likely that populations are plastic, being most abundant when canegrass is plentiful and withdrawing to refuges during drought. Habitat The Eyrean grasswren habitat consists of sandhill canegrass (Zygochloa paradoxa) tussocks on large, loosely sanded dune crests and slopes; as well as in speargrass (Aristida holathera), spinifex (Triodia spp.) and dune pea (Swainsona rigida) where it grows among Z. paradoxa. Typical landscapes consist of tussocks ranging from 1-4m high and 2-3m in diameter, spaced well apart and with bare ground between them. The birds rarely stray from dune slopes; but are sometimes observed in swales. Behaviour No extensive surveys of Eyrean grasswren behaviour have been undertaken, but it is thought to be sedentary. They are usually found in singles and pairs, or small groups of up to ten. It is cryptic, remaining hidden within Z. paradoxa tussocks, and is difficult to flush. Flight is rare, but when flushed the birds bound with wings half spread between tussock clumps or fly short distances of up to 10m with the tail trailing. They use a distinctive \\"half running, half flying\\" movement low to the ground, bounding and flying for short distances of 40‚Äì220 cm. Movements are quick and furtive with the tail usually held cocked. They sometimes perch low (c. 1 m) on grevillea branches, canegrass or other shrubs. Diet Prey consists of about equal amounts of vegetation and invertebrates. Specimen stomach contents include seeds from grasses Z. paradoxa and Aristida holathera, as well as remnants of numerous invertebrate species. Individuals move with small hops while foraging between clumps of spinifex (Triodia spp.) and within clumps of dune pea (Swainsona rigida). It will sometimes skip backwards and shuffle the feet to uncover food items in the sand. Reproduction Very little is known about the mating habits of A. goyderi. No information exists on laying or incubation durations. Nests containing nestlings and eggs have been located from July to September and dependent fledglings from May to September. Clutches are 2-3 broadly oval eggs with slight variations in shape. It is assumed to be monogamous and to breed throughout the range. Females are responsible for nest construction, which takes about one week to complete. Nests are wedged into tussock stems close to the ground (usually <1m height) in clumps of Z. paradoxa and Australian boxthorn (Lychan austral). The nest consists of a truncated cup or dome of varying dimensions made from grasses such as A. holathera with Z. paradoxa strands woven in to the base, while an inner cup consists of finer grass and sometimes downy plant material or spider silk. Nests are well spaced but may be more densely aggregated in patches of good habitat. Vocalisations Contact calls are made throughout the day, usually given as call and response. Adults of both sexes sing, which may function in territorial defence or maintaining group cohesion. Songs are performed from low perches or on the ground, and may increase in frequency during the breeding season. The songs are \\"distinctive\\", consisting of \\"beautiful silvery cadences, pip trills and long bursting staccatos\\" which may sometimes be meshed together in excited bursts. These may be heard up to 100m away, while the quieter contact calls can be heard from 30-40m. Alarm calls are high and sharp, and are louder than the contact call. Conservation A. goyderi was listed by the IUCN as threatened in 1988, and as special concern by the Royal Australian Ornithologist's Union in 1992 as further research was required. The IUCN currently lists it as least concern since the species is not thought to be declining and probably fluctuates due to seasonal cycles. Threats include any species or processes affecting the quality of sandhill canegrass habitat such as erosion driven by grazing rabbits, camels and livestock. Ornithological history The first record of A. goyderi came from an expedition by J.W.Lewis into the arid northern regions of South Australia in 1874, resulting in the collection of six specimens obtained near the Macumba river on Lake Eyre. Two of these specimens were forwarded by the curator of the South Australian Museum F.W.Andrews, to John Gould who described them in 1875. These were later given to the British Museum of Natural History, however the remainder were lost. A third specimen was found in the Dobroyde collection housed at the Australian Museum in Sydney; although it is now thought that this is not one of the missing type specimens. No further specimens were obtained until a century after Lewis‚Äô expedition when two were acquired in Qld in 1976. A second expedition later that year resulted in 19 specimens, 3 nests and 2 eggs. Prior to then, numerous specimens were misidentified. In the time since May's observations at Poeppel's Corner the species has been located many times. However, due to the cryptic nature of the species and the remoteness of its distribution very little research into the behavioural habits has been undertaken. Some attempts to trap the bird failed as they are so small, they were able to pass through mist nets.

It is endemic to Western Australia. Naturalist Frederick Maurice House discovered the black grasswren in 1901, as a part of a surveying party led by Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman through the Kimberley in northwestern Australia. He collected a single specimen. Alexander William Milligan, consulting ornithologist at the Western Australian Museum, named it after House when he described the species. The bird was not seen again until 1968, when Dan Freeman of the Natural History Museum led a party to the same area to find it. Its natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation and open woodland, punctuated by large sandstone boulders and slabs. It has been classified as Near Threatened as bushfires have become more frequent, as has rainfall, which has altered the landscape. Black grasswrens are not highly mobile and have possibly become locally extinct around Manning Creek due to fire before 2007. The black grasswren is seldom seen ‚Äì even when most people visit (in the cooler months), it hides in cracks and fissures in sandstone. Its eggs and nest were only discovered in 1998, the lack of knowledge owing to the fact that the region is largely inaccessible during the summer wet season. The nest is an oval structure of dried grass stems and leaves in tussocks of soft spinifex (Triodia pungens). It has an entrance in a small spout, with a landing in front of it. The female incubates the clutch, which generally consists of two eggs. The eggs are white with sparse dark markings and measure 21‚Äì22.2 mm long by 15.6‚Äì16.7 mm wide.

The species is endemic to Australia but is limited to inland areas of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia. Description The dusky grasswren is superficially similar in appearance to a number of the other grasswrens in the genus Amytornis, but is the only member of this genus to exclusively inhabit rocky ranges across Central Australia. It has a predominantly brown base colour to its plumage with fine pale streaking over the head breast and mantle. The brown of the plumage is a richer chestnut on the back and pale to almost buff on the belly and vent. The most obvious difference between sexes is the bright rusty-brown spot on the fore-flanks of the adult female and all birds exhibit the characteristic cocked tail posture common to all malurids. Field identification right The species is easily identified within its core range by its distinctive vocalisations (see further information below). The mouse-like, strongly terrestrial, habits of the species can make it difficult to observe clearly within its preferred habitat of boulder-strewn rocky hillsides covered with spinifex grasses. But when observed well, the cocked tail, overall brown colouration and strongly terrestrial habits should be sufficient to achieve a positive identification. Similar species The dusky grasswren is similar in shape and form to most of the other species in Amytornis, but is relatively unmistakable if seen well in the field. It probably doesn't overlap in its use of habitat with any other species of grasswren and also differs in its vocalisations. The species most likely to cause confusion are the Kalkadoon grasswren (Amytornis ballarae), with which it was considered conspecific until 1999,http://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO98054 and the thick-billed grasswren (Amytornis modestus). The former only occurs well to the northeast of the currently-known distribution of dusky grasswren; the latter is considered extinct in the Northern Territory and only occurs to the south and east of the known distribution of dusky grasswren in South Australia. Dusky grasswren might also be confused with striated grasswren (A. striatus) but is not currently-known to occur in the sand plain and dunefield habitat of this species. Striated grasswren is also so boldly marked by comparison to dusky grasswren that it should be unlikely to cause any confusion in the field. Fairywrens within family Maluridae overlap with dusky grasswren in both their distribution and use of habitat including: Splendid Fairywren (Malurus splendens); Purple-backed Fairywren (M. assimilis); and White-winged Fairywren (M. leucopterus). Although these species may display a superficial resemblance to the dusky grasswren in their contact calls, their posture and manner of moving, and their general size and shape, if properly seen and heard in full song they are easy to separate. The fairywren species are all a uniform grey colour (except for breeding males which will sport brightly-coloured alternate plumage) with varying amounts of blue visible on adult's tails. Vocalisations This species most often reveals itself initially with a sharp, metallic tutting in alarm or a drawn-out seeeep contact call. The vocal repertoire of the dusky grasswren is varied and includes trills, high-pitched whistles, rapid twittering, and high-speed warbling. Much of the richness in the calls is difficult for humans to detect due to the extreme speed with which they are performed. When recordings are slowed however, the extensive lexicon used by the species becomes more obvious. A dusky grasswren (Amytornis purnelli) from the Tennant Creek, NT population singing. A spectrogram of the trill call of a dusky grasswren Geographic Variations Some geographic variations have been notedhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/work/228667952?q&versionId;=251237872 but further research is required before a determination can be made as to whether these variations are sufficient to warrant taxonomic recognition. There are vocal differences (more stentorian and staccato in the north of their range) as well as plumage differences (birds are observed to be paler in the north of their range and richer rufous-brown in the south). Ecology Habitat Across their entire range, dusky grasswrens adhere to the same habitat type: rocky ranges and outcrops, often preferring tumbled talus or scree, and with areas of thick, long-unburnt spinifex grasses in the genus Triodia. They are not known to use sandplain habitat adjacent to rocky areas which may be one factor giving rise to the patchiness of their occurrence across Central Australia. Diet In the wild dusky grasswrens have been observed feeding on a range of small arthropods and other invertebrates; seeds; and small desert fruits but there are few published accounts of wild feeding observations. In captivity the species has been observed to subsist on a typical aviary feed-out of meat mix, greens and vegetables enriched with a variety of live invertebrate prey including cockroaches and mealworms. In Captivity An adult female dusky grasswren at Alice Springs Desert Park with metal leg band visible. The species has been successfully kept in captivity at Alice Springs Desert Park since 2009 where it has also been successfully bred and released back into the wild.http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2011-09-23/the-bird-that-pretends-to-be- a-mouse/6178958 Taxonomy The species was considered polytypic until 1999 when the subspecies A. purnelli ballarae was elevated to species as Kalkadoon grasswren (A. ballarae) by Schodde & Mason in the Directory of Australian Birds. This leaves dusky grasswren as a monotypic species occupying a vast but disjunct range. In this same publication however, Schodde & Mason also observed that the dusky grasswren is \\"probably polytypic\\". Distribution The majority of the range of the dusky grasswren is very remote terrain with little or no regular human visitation. As such, its distribution is very poorly known and although its range covers a large area on the map, it may occupy this region very patchily and be absent from much of it. The northernmost records of the species come from the Ashburton Range near Banka Banka in the Northern Territory; the most southerly are in the Musgrave, Mann and Tomkinson Ranges of South Australia. They have been observed as far west as the Schwern-Mural Crescent near Giles in Western Australia and as far east as the Davenport and Murchison Ranges in the Northern Territory. Within this region there are very large areas of unsuitable habitat separating populations. Status and conservation None of the IUCN criteria for threat classification are triggered by the dusky grasswren, mainly due to its very large range. Although detailed population and distributional data are lacking, it is assumed to have a stable population across a wide distribution and, as such, is not considered vulnerable to becoming an endangered species. Threats There are no published accounts of dusky grasswren being preyed upon by introduced predators but it is likely that they are eaten by cats and foxes. Other species within Amytornis have been found in the stomach contents of feral cats.http://www.publish.csiro.au/am/AM17033 Likewise there are no published data on the impacts of fire on this species but there are abundant anecdotal accounts suggesting that it may take decades for birds to return to habitat once it has been burnt. If this is the case, then changing fire management practices and changes to natural fuel loads caused by the encroachment of invasive weedshttp://www.publish.csiro.au/rj/RJ09076 may need to be considered as possible threatening processes. Human interaction Due to their cryptic nature and perhaps the allure of their remote homelands, all of the grasswrens in the genus Amytornis have attracted devotees among ornithologists and birdwatchers from around the world. Most grasswrens are notoriously difficult to find and, even once found, they can be frustratingly difficult to observe. In addition to being the only species on display in captivity, the dusky grasswren has a reputation as being one of the easier grasswrens to see in the wild. It occurs in healthy numbers in the MacDonnell Range close to the major outback town of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory and has been regularly recorded and well-photographed in this vicinity. Indigenous knowledge Due to its large range, the dusky grasswren occurs in the traditional lands of dozens of Indigenous peoples of central Australia. It is not known to be referred to by a specific epithet in any of the languages of central Australia but may be called by a number of names which are broadly applied to a number of small bird species. The species may be referred to as ' in Pitjantjatjara/Yankunytjatjara; ' in Warlpiri; and ' in Anmatyerre and Arrernte but these are all names which are also used for species of Fairywren within the genus Malurus. The only published Indigenous epithets that may apply specifically to either dusky grasswren or striated grasswren are ' from Alyawarre; ' from Kaytetye; and ' from Ngaanyatjarra/Ngaatjatjarra.

Observations of the Striated Grasswren Amytornis striatus rowleyi at Opalton, central western Queensland. Australian Field Ornithology 2014 31 17-23. While closely related to the familiar fairy-wrens (Malurinae) striated grasswrens are larger (17-20g c.f. 6-16g), and more sombrely coloured, with varyingly prominent white streaking on varying shades of brown, rufous and black plumage. Striated grasswrens are usually seen as pairs, but sometimes as individuals, and often in small groups of up to five birds, which are unobtrusive, shy, and typically difficult to approach, often first detected by their calls. When breeding, birds may be inquisitive of intruders of their territory.  Ecology and behavior   Distribution and habitat  Striated grasswrens are the most widespread of the grasswrens, with a range which extends from the through northern South Australia, across central and southwestern New South Wales, northwest Victoria and into southern and eastern South Australia.Christidis, L. 1999. Evolution and biogeography of the Australian grasswrens, Amytornis (Aves:Maluridae): biogeochemical perspectives. Australian Journal of Zoology, 47, 113-124.

Like other grasswrens, striated grasswrens mainly forage on the ground, sifting through leaf-litter beneath shrubs and surrounding spinifex Triodia tussocks, never far from cover. While foraging, birds move mainly by hopping, with tail help almost vertical, when moving through shrubs and dense vegetation, tail help horizontal. When disturbed in the open, move with great speed and agility from cover-to-cover with a half-bounding half-flying action reminiscent of a bouncing ball.  Diet  Striated grasswrens are insectivorous and granivorous, foraging on the ground amongst leaf-litter and open areas, and gleaning from the foliage of herbs, forbs and low shrubs for primarily beetles and ants, and seeds of spinifex (Triodia) and other plants. Striated grasswrens have been often observed to form foraging associations with other bird species including rufous-crowned emu-wren (Stipiturus ruficeps), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophyrus) and variegated fairy-wren (Malurus lamberti).  Reproduction and social organisation  Striated grasswrens are most often recorded in pairs, and sometimes in groups of 3 and up to 10 birds, it is believed that pairs or family congregations may be more common outside of breeding season, and may range more widely over suitable areas of habitat.Rowley, I. and Russell, E. 1997 Fairy-wrens and Grasswrens: Maluridae. Oxford University Press, Oxford. The cooperative breeding seen in other Maluridae has not been recorded in the wild in striated grasswrens. In captivity, members of family groups have been observed to allopreen and sunbathe together on branches, bathe in dry soil and fine water mists, and chase one-another around.Hutton, R. 1991. Australian Softbill Management. Singil Press, Sydney. Breeding is typically between July and November, but breeding outside of the usual period is likely to occur in response to sufficient rainfall, particularly in central and northern Australia.Beruldsen, G.. 1980. A Field Guide to Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds. Rigby, Adelaide. Nest is a bulky domed structure of spinifex spines, lined with bark strips, grass, plant down and feathers, close to the ground and well concealed, usually in a spinifex tussock. Eggs are rounded oval, white to pinkish white, finely textured and sparsely marked with purplish-red spots and blotches, mainly at the larger end. A clutch of 2, rarely 3 eggs is incubated by the female for 13‚Äì14 days. Upon hatching, both parents observed to be equally active in the feeding of chicks, and removal of faecal sacs. Chicks fledge at 12‚Äì14 days, and remain hidden in dense cover close to the nest for 3‚Äì4 days, not gaining full independence for a further 3 to 4 weeks. Striated grasswren nests are known to be parasitized by Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), black-eared cuckoo (Chrysococcyx osculans) and fan- tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis).Parsons and McGlip 1934 in Higgins 2001.  Call  Striated grasswrens are recognised as having three calls: a contact call, song and an alarm call. The contact call has been described as a regularly uttered high pitched seep, see-see or tseee-tseet, which is very soft and may be inaudible in moderate winds. The song is diagnostic and much louder than contact calls, and may be audible for up to 40 m. It is described as a sweet, rippling wren-like reel, lasting up to 10 seconds, varying in pitch and consisting of whistles, buzzes, twangs and staccato notes, is uttered far less frequently, and has been observed singing from an exposed branch with its open bill pointing skywards. The alarm call is described as a series of short, loud, harsh single notes, transliterated as jit-jit or tchiritt, given when birds are flushed from cover.

Source: Dan Eyles  Taxonomy and systematics  The striated grasswren (Amytornis striatus) is a Passeriform in the Maluridae Family, which is shared with the familiar Australian and New Guinean fairy-wrens. It is one of 13 species of grasswren currently recognised in the subfamily Amytornithae, all within the Genus Amytornis, and confined to mainland Australia.Christidis, L., F. E. Rheindt, W. E. Boles & J. A. Norman, 2013. A re-appraisal of species diversity within the Australian grasswrens Amytornis (Aves: Maluridae). Austral. Zoologist 36 (4). The species was first described by John Gould in 1840 from a specimen collected on the Liverpool Plains of NSW. The scientific name of this species translates the genus Amytornis from Greek ‚ÄòAmytis bird‚Äô Amytis being an ancient Persian female name with no direct link to the species, while ornis translated to ‚Äòbird‚Äô directly from Greek, while the specific name refers to the heavily streaked upperparts, from Modern Latin striatus striped; streaked, which is in turn from Latin stria, a line.Gray, J. and Fraser I.

Conservation status   Threats  Clearing of large areas for agriculture in the southeast of this species range have caused the direct loss of some populations and fragmentation of remnant areas of habitat, reducing the size of these populations rendering them more vulnerable to genetic effects and change events such as fire and drought. Striated grasswrens are vulnerable to large wildfires which cause direct mortalities of these weak flying species, and remove critical habitat and protection from predators, birds show a preference for areas with large hummocks of spinifex, 25‚Äì40 years post-fire, though birds have been found to occupy some areas 6 to 8 years after fire. Grazing by introduced herbivores affects habitat structure and is likely to contribute to population declines.Val, J., Oliver, D., Pennay, M., McLaughlin, J., Ewin, P. and Foster, E. (2012) The reptile, bird and small mammal fauna of Dune Mallee Woodlands in southwestern New South Wales. Australian Zoologist 36(1): 29-48 Predation from introduced foxes and cats, particularly where populations have already declined, or are exposed by small areas of habitat following land clearance or fire.  Conservation status by state  The striated grasswren is listed as near threatened nationally under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and within Victoria under the DELP Advisory List; and vulnerable in NSW under the Threatened Species Conservation Act and South Australia under the National Parks and Wildlife Act.  Future management  The management of fire to reduce the incidence of large wildfires removing vast areas of habitat, through prescribed burning and avoidance of anthropogenic fire is critical to the maintenance of areas of suitable habitat. Reduced stocking rates of introduced herbivores, particularly goats, and exclusion of these from some areas, to allow adequate regeneration of vegetation. Control of exotic pest species such as cats, foxes and rabbits reduces the threat of predation, and competition for resources.

It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. Taxonomy and systematics The thick- billed grasswren was formerly considered as conspecific with the western grasswren until split as a separate species in 2010.  Subspecies  While not completely accepted by all authourities, the following seven subspecies are recognized by Clements and the IOC:IOC v.6.3 * ‚Ä†A. m. modestus ‚Äì (North, 1902): Now extinct. Formerly found in Northern Territory (central Australia) * A. m. indulkanna ‚Äì (Mathews, 1916): Found in Northern Territory and South Australia (central Australia) * A. m. raglessi ‚Äì Black, 2011: Found in Flinders Ranges in South Australia (central Australia) * A. m. curnamona ‚Äì Black, 2011: Found in Lake Frome Basin in South Australia (central Australia) * A. m. cowarie ‚Äì Black, 2016: Found in Sturt Stony Desert in South Australia (central Australia) * A. m. obscurior ‚Äì (Mathews, 1923): Found in New South Wales (central Australia) * ‚Ä†A. m. inexpectatus ‚Äì (Mathews, 1912): Now extinct. Formerly found in New South Wales (central Australia) Description Illustration from 1910 The thick-billed grasswren has dull brown underparts, a long dark-brown tail and noticeable white streaking on the head. It has white streaks continuing down the neck, throat and down to the rump. The white streaks across the chin to the forehead and along the wings and rump, contrast with the red-brown to grey colours of the feathers. Males have distinguishably longer tails. Females also have chestnut flanks. Vocals are a combination of short high-pitched song, repeated. They have a soft, high-pitched call that is often inaudible to human ears. Distribution and habitat The thick-billed grasswren is endemic to Australia and is found throughout the arid regions of northwestern New South Wales (NSW), northern parts of South Australia, through to southern sections of the Northern Territory. It is also speculated to still occur in fragmented populations in the Grey Range of Sturt National Park. Chenopod scrublands (consisting largely of saltbush), sandhill cane-grass and flood debris in dry, sandy watercourses. They favour the scrublands with dense chenopod bushes. These denser shrublands usually occur in lower lying areas, such as watercourses and drainage lines. Both subspecies, occurring at different distributions prefer particular species. The Eastern Thick-billed Grasswren prefers saltbush. The Western Thick-billed Grasswren; black-bush and Australian boxthorn. Behaviour and ecology Thick-billed grasswrens are usually sedentary, with these elusive birds seen running, hopping or rarely flying, between vegetative cover to remain undetected. They can also be seen foraging for food at ground level around vegetation. Wrens have a generalist beak type that allows them to eat a range of foods. The thick bill allows for tougher seeds and other food niches to be accessed, compared with the smaller fairy wren species. If disturbed, individuals take refuge in any existing cover ‚Äì usually vegetation or piles of old flood debris along dry sandy watercourses and even down rabbit burrows. They are often seen solitarily or in pairs. Sources vary, but mating pairs maintain between five, and 20 to 40 hectare territories year-round and rarely, possibly never, band with their neighbours outside the breeding season. Family groups are sometimes seen during the post-fledgling period, while the young are still dependent on their parents. The feather patterns/markings imitate their preferred habitat as a form of camouflage. Breeding Breeding occurs between July and September. Nests can usually be seen in low branches in saltbush, can-grass and other similar vegetation. The nest composes of loose grass and bark in the shape of a half dome, with finer grass, fur, feathers lining the nest. One to three (usually two) eggs of various colourings of white, cream and pink; with blotches of red-brown or purplish grey. They have an incubation period of two weeks and fledge in 10‚Äì12 days. The estimated generation length of the thick- billed grasswren is four years . Feeding The thick-billed grasswren eats mainly insects and other small invertebrates, as well as plant seeds and berries. Threats  The main threat to thick-billed grasswrens is loss of habitat through clearing and overgrazing by hard hooved animals, such as sheep and goats that trample the vegetation. This reduces the area and quality of the habitat that the thick-billed grasswren prefer. Particularly the larger shrubs that provide prime habitat for breeding. Habitat modification has also occurred due to rabbits. Feral species, such as foxes and cats are major threats due to predation. All threats have been compounded by droughts over the past decade. High frequency wildfires are also a threat to the quality of habitat. Higher frequency of fires disrupts the life cycle processes of the thick-billed grasswren, as well as the plants and macroinvertebrates that they depend on. Changes in expected environmental conditions, will also challenge tolerance ranges and exacerbate the impacts of existing threats to the species. Status The thick-billed grasswren is a poor flyer, and because of this has a poor dispersal capability and is highly susceptible to population fragmentation. Both the NSW Government Office of Environment and Heritage, and the Commonwealth of Australia, classify the thick-billed grasswren as critically endangered. However the South Australian government and the IUCN red list classify the thick-billed grass wren as ‚Äòleast concern‚Äô. It was gazetted under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, in 2009.

Biography Family background Gyorgyi was born in Budapest into a well-known clan of artists which stretched back generations. On his father's side, his great grandfather, Alajos Giergl (1793‚Äì1868) was a silversmith who originated from the Tyrol and his grandfather, Alajos Gy√∂rgyi Giergl (1821‚Äì1863), was a well-known painter in Pest. His father, K√°lm√°n Gy√∂rgyi (1860‚Äì1930) was a craftsman and art theorist, the director of the National Society of Applied Arts and editor of its journal. Two other close relatives, G√©za Gyorgyi (1851‚Äì1934) and K√°lm√°n Giergl (1863‚Äì1934) were well known architects. The latter built the Music Academy and Klotild Palaces in Pest. Also notable in the clan was Henrik Giergl (1827‚Äì1871), a glass artist and trader. Career Gyorgyi began studying architecture at the Budapest Joseph Technical University, where he met his slightly older contemporary K√°roly K√≥s. Together they formed a unique partnership and, most significantly, they built the V√°rosmajor Street school in Budapest. On his own, Gy√∂rgyi designed the Hangya Associated Office building (1920) and many other schools and public buildings in regional cities, for example the Copf-style Deri Museum in Debrecen. He also designed numerous pavilions for world fairs: the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the Brussels International Exposition (1935), and the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937). He designed the Electricity Works at Budapest's Sz√©kesf≈ëv√°ros (1926‚Äì1938), which incorporated art deco and modernist elements. In 1945, Gy√∂rgyi lost his only son and his last work was to be competed 3 years later, a primary school at Balatonalm√°di where he lived his final years. He briefly became involved in the Hungarian People's Republic offices of State Planning during the 1950s, but illness prevented this from continuing. Gy√∂rgyi died in Balatonalm√°di. His collaborator K√≥s considered him \\"One of the outstanding architects in Hungary of that sorrowful and dark period between the wars\\".

The portion of the highway in the U.S. state of Utah is , through the northern part of the state. From west to east, I-80 crosses the state line from Nevada in Tooele County and traverses the Bonneville Salt Flats‚Äîwhich are a part of the larger Great Salt Lake Desert. It continues alongside the Wendover Cut-off‚Äîthe corridor of the former Victory Highway‚ÄîU.S. Route 40 (US-40) and the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route. After passing the Oquirrh Mountains, I-80 enters the Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake County. A short portion of the freeway is concurrent with I-15 through Downtown Salt Lake City. At the Spaghetti Bowl, I-80 turns east again into the mouth of Parley's Canyon and Summit County, travels through the mountain range and intersects the eastern end of I-84 near Echo Reservoir before turning northeast towards the Wyoming border near Evanston. I-80 was built along the corridor of the Lincoln Highway and the Mormon Trail through the Wasatch Range. The easternmost section also follows the historical routes of the First Transcontinental Railroad and US-30S. Construction of the controlled-access highway began in the 1950s, and by the late 1970s most of the freeway across the state of Utah had been completed. The section of I-80 between Utah State Route 68 (SR-68, Redwood Road) and the Salt Lake City International Airport was the last piece of the nearly freeway to be completed. It was opened on August 22, 1986, and was about from the site of another cross-country milestone in Utah, the driving of the Golden Spike of the First Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Summit. Average daily traffic volumes in 2012 ranged between 6,765 vehicles using the freeway at SR-58 and 121,205 vehicles using the freeway at the Spaghetti Bowl in Downtown Salt Lake City. Throughout the state, the highway is also known as the Purple Heart Trail. Route description Out of the eleven states which I-80 passes through, the segment in Utah is the fourth shortest. The longest stretch of I-80 in a single state is the segment in Nebraska. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the entire route is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways to measure traffic volumes. This measure is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 6,765 vehicles traveled I-80 at the interchange with SR-58 in Wendover, and as many as 121,205 vehicles used the highway at the Spaghetti Bowl in downtown Salt Lake City. Between seven and 58 percent of the traffic recorded consisted of trucks. These counts are for the portion of the freeway in Utah. Tooele County The freeway enters Utah from Nevada in the city of Wendover on the edge of the Bonneville Salt Flats. The cities of West Wendover, Nevada and Wendover are accessible by I-80's only business loop in Utah, whose interchange is just south of Danger Cave. The highway closely follows the historical routes of the Wendover Cutoff, the Victory Highway, and of the ex-Western Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad Central Corridor) across the salt flats and the larger Great Salt Lake Desert. Bonneville Speedway, home to many land speed records, is accessible from I-80. In the middle of the salt flats is a concrete sculpture, Metaphor: The Tree of Utah, which stands just off the westbound carriageway of I-80, east of Wendover. Bounded on each sides by military training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains in a small gap between them and the Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele; these communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively. It is in this section that I-80 reaches its lowest elevation in Utah, above sea level. After an interchange with SR-36 at Stansbury Park, the highway crosses a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and the Great Salt Lake. Salt Lake County View west along I-80 at the eastern junction with I-15 and SR-201 in Salt Lake County While traversing the neck, views can be had from I-80 of the Lake and Antelope Island. After passing the neck, the road forks, with I-80 proceeding towards the north end of Salt Lake City and SR-201 proceeding towards the south end. Historically, this intersection was the separation of US-40 and US-50. After the intersection, the freeway corridor is again bottlenecked with the Great Salt Lake to the north and the Kennecott Copper smelter and tailings pond to the south. The Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Mine, which was once considered to be the largest open-pit copper mine, can be seen in the distance. The Kennecott Smokestack is one of the tallest freestanding structures in the United States. Along this portion, the freeway passes the historical site of the Saltair Resort. The Spaghetti Bowl in South Salt Lake The freeway enters the Salt Lake Valley on the former alignment of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling down the center of North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-68 and 600 South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as the Spaghetti Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100 South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Park‚Äîonce the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270¬∞ belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway. Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line, the route re-enters the Wasatch National Forest. Summit County Parley's Canyon carries I-80 up the western slope of the Wasatch Front as a six-lane freeway, cresting the mountains at an elevation of at Parley's Summit, the highest point on I-80 within the state of Utah. Both the canyon and summit were named for Parley P. Pratt, an early settler to the Salt Lake Valley and an early Mormon leader who was asked to survey a new route across the mountains to replace the route through Emigration Canyon. Between 1848 and 1851, Pratt surveyed, completed, and operated the Golden Pass toll road through the canyon that today bears his name. Pratt had unsuccessfully solicited for $800 (equivalent to $ in ) to build the road, and sold it for $1,500 (equivalent to $ in ). On and off ramps for the Wyoming port-of-entry are located just within Utah. In January 2014, UDOT introduced variable speed limits to I-80 in Parley's Canyon, allowing a speed limit between up to the normal depending on weather or traffic conditions. View along I-80 eastbound in Parley's Canyon Beyond Parley's Summit lies Park City, a mining town today better known for its many ski resorts. The Historic Union Pacific Rail Trail State Park travels in the median between carriageways of I-80 before paralleling the highway until the southern end of Echo Reservoir. The freeway turns north upon reaching the Rockport Reservoir at Wanship following the tributaries of the Weber River toward Echo Reservoir and dam. Upon reaching Echo Canyon and the junction with the eastern terminus of the western section of I-84, the freeway follows the canyon east until it reaches the Wyoming state line near Evanston. I-80 forms the northeastern border between Rich and Summit Counties. The portion through Echo Canyon follows the historical routes of the Mormon Trail, US-30S, and the First Transcontinental Railroad. A rest area in the canyon just east of the junction with I-84 features signs pointing out features that were obstacles for both the Mormon pioneers and the railroad construction workers, including Pulpit Rock, which was partially demolished when the I-80 was built through the canyon. History I-80 eastbound across the Bonneville Salt Flats. Earlier roads I-80 follows the routes of two major auto trails through the state. In western Utah, I-80 follows the historical route of the Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US-40 near Park City. Throughout Utah, I-80 is signed as the modern route of the Lincoln Highway‚Äîexcept through Salt Lake City, where the Lincoln Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley's Way. The route of the Lincoln Highway across Utah was generally derived from the route of the Pony Express and the Central Overland Route. However, much of the original route of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City is inaccessible. The original route of the Lincoln Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely, Nevada. This area is now used for military bases, such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot. The area was closed to the public when these bases were established. I-80 and US-93 are the modern signing of the Lincoln Highway between those two cities. East of Salt Lake City, I-80 closely parallels the original route of the Lincoln Highway. In 1926, much of the route covered by I-80, including Pratt's former toll road from the Nevada state line into Salt Lake City, was signed as US-40 then as US-30 to the Wyoming state line. It was also part of the Victory Highway west of Salt Lake and the Lincoln Highway east of Salt Lake at this time. Most of the route had been improved but some stretches of graded road remained. In 1937, parts of the route near Wanship were numbered US-530. In 1950, the highway near Echo was designated US-30S and US-189. By 1959, US-50 Alternate was also routed along the western portion of I-80. Current road The first Utah State Route to have the number 80 is now known as SR-92, which was originally numbered SR-80 until the 1977 renumbering of Utah State highways. Previously, the freeway's legislative designation was SR-2. I-80 passing the Oquirrh Mountains westbound along the shores of the Great Salt Lake Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 formed the Interstate Highway System, and the I-80 number was first designated to a then-unconstructed controlled-access highway across the state by 1957. I-80 was constructed in segments, starting in the late 1950s. By the late 1970s, the Utah portion of I-80‚Äîexcept for a gap on the western edge of Salt Lake City‚Äîwas largely complete. A section between Redwood Road and Salt Lake City International Airport is the final link of the transcontinental freeway to be completed. As an Interstate Highway, design specifications require a controlled-access highway with no at-grade intersections. This section was dedicated on August 22, 1986, and was the last to be completed to Interstate Highway specifications along the almost route of I-80 between San Francisco, California and Teaneck, New Jersey. The section was completed close to the thirtieth anniversary of the Interstate Highway System, which was noted at the dedication and considered to be a milestone in the history of highway construction in the United States. It was also noted at the dedication that this was only south of Promontory Summit, where the golden spike of the United States First Transcontinental Railroad was laid. View east along I-80 toward the eastern I-215 interchange (foreground) and downtown Salt Lake City (background) The original designation of I-84, which begins at an interchange with I-80 in Echo, was I-80N. This designation was changed to I-84 in 1977 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials despite objections from the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Idaho Transportation Department, and with the support of UDOT and the Oregon Department of Transportation. The legislative designation for this highway was SR-3 until the 1977 renumbering. Rebuilding of the first portions of I-80 began in October 1990 with a stretch near Redwood Road in Salt Lake City. By 1991, UDOT estimated that the reconstruction of all federally funded highways in the state would cost up to $4.3 billion (equivalent to $ in ). The Spaghetti Bowl interchange was first proposed in 1996 to accommodate traffic for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in the city. Most of the Spaghetti Bowl was open by November 2000; the remainder opened in early 2001. In 2002, the Utah State Legislature named the highway the Purple Heart trail, in honor of wounded war veterans. Additional reconstruction work‚Äîwhich involved replacing most of the bridges along the route, resurfacing and installation of sound barriers‚Äîwas done on I-80 between the Spaghetti Bowl and Parley's Canyon in 2007 and 2008.

China and the United States are also among the largest coal consumers. Other important coal producing countries include Australia, India, South Africa, and Russia. A coal-mining region is a region in which coal mining is a significant economic activity. Coal-mining regions are often associated with the social, cultural and environmental impact of coal mining.  United States  Coal regions of the United States Coal mining in the United States has historically had economic and cultural dominance in regions such as the Allegheny Mountains and Appalachian Mountains, where it was a major part of identity and traditions. The replacement of workers by mechanization has had major consequences for the industry and for the people it affects. Coal is mined in the Appalachian Mountains region, and the Midwest. Most coal now produced in the United States is mined in western surface mines, especially in Wyoming's Powder River Basin. A surface mining method often used in the Appalachians is mountaintop removal mining. The states with the largest recoverable coal reserves are, in descending order, Wyoming, West Virginia, Illinois, and Montana.US Energy Information Administration: Recoverable coal reserves and average annuay recovery percentage at producing mines by state, 2006, 2005, PDF file, downloaded 27 January 2009. The largest single mine in the United States is the North Antolope Rachelle near Gillette, Wyoming; it produces more coal annually than many states. In 2009, it alone produced over 100 million tons of coal, and has plans to produce 130 million ton in 2012 more than 23 other coal producing states including Pennsylvania. Areas with significant coal mining activities include: * Coal Region of Pennsylvania - One of the largest deposits of anthracite coal, the region is in Northeastern Pennsylvania, in the central Appalachian Mountains comprising Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Carbon, Schuylkill, Northumberland, and the extreme northeast corner of Dauphin counties.

United Kingdom - Britain had major coal-mining activity in the past, but since the 1980s coal mining has been in decline due to the increased use of natural gas in power stations and cheaper imports. Very few working coal mines and open- cast quarries now exist in Britain. :In England, the West Midlands region, which covers the western part of the English Midlands. The West Midlands conurbation is the name given to the large conurbation in the region that includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The \\"Black Country\\" is a loosely defined area of the English West Midlands which includes the north and west of Birmingham and the south and east of Wolverhampton, famous for its coal mines (especially in Staffordshire), its coal coking operations, and other heavy industry, including iron foundries and steel mills that used local coal to fire their furnaces, all of which produced a level of air pollution that had few equals anywhere in the world. :The Kent coalfield in Kent in South East England also had coal mining operations. In South West England, Somerset was the location of the Somerset coalfields until 1973. Yorkshire in North West England also was formerly home to major coal mining operations. :In Wales, the South Wales coalfield provided a large amount of Welsh coal.

China  China is currently the world's largest coal miner, and it is also the largest consumer of coal in the world.retrieved from http://cornerstonemag.net/chinas-coal- industry-must-follow-the-path-of-sustainable-production-capacity/ China‚Äôs coal output has continued to increase and its production capacity has expanded at an unprecedented rate, with an annual increase in production of 200 million tonnes on average. In 2012, the total output of coal reached 3.66 billion tonnes. However, based on China‚Äôs existing coal mining technologies, this level of output greatly exceeds the sustainable coal production capacity in terms of resources, the environment, and safety. Behind this huge production statistic are excessive waste of coal resources, a large number of casualties among workers, and serious damage to water resources and the environment. These problems are the basis of resistance for the continued development of China‚Äôs coal industry.  Mongolia  Mongolia has proven reserves of 12.2 billion tons of coal including 2 billion tons of coking coal and 10.1 billion tons of thermal coal. Mongolia is estimated to have potential coal reserves of some 100 billion metric tonnes.http://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/coal/as/mn/p0005.htm While Mongolia's output is approximately only 5 million tonnes of coal per year, it will grow significantly given its proximity to China.

South Africa  In South Africa coal is mined in several regions, mainly in the East Rand around Witbank, in the Vaal valley around the Vaal Triangle, the Waterberg in the Limpopo Province and at Dundee and Newcastle in northern KwaZulu Natal. South Africa is currently the leading African coal producer.MBendi Information for Africa, \\"Africa: Mining - Coal Mining - Overview, 2008-08, webpage:  Russia  Russia is currently the fifth largest producer of coal, and has the second largest reserves, estimated at 175 billion. The majority of its coal is located behind the Ural Mountains in Siberia. By 1999 approximately a third of coal mining business was privatized. Since then, the industry has concentrated in hands of few companies - coking coal producers were integrated with steel makers, and two national leaders in steam coal emerged. Russian coal miners have recently campaigned for improvements in their working conditions, leading to some reform. Mechel controls the Southern Kuzbass Coal Company in Kuznetsk, the Elga Coal Field in the Sakha Republic with 2.2 billion metric tons of reserves of coal, and the Neryungrinsky coal mine at Neryungri in the Sakha Republic.

It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds. Taxonomy Trapped female bird at Polokwane, Limpopo The species was described in 1868 by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis based on a specimen from East Africa, probably from the coast opposite Zanzibar. It was initially placed in the genus Crithagra but later moved to a genus of its own, Anomalospiza. The name of the genus means \\"anomalous finch\\" with spiza being a Greek word for finch. The specific name imberbis comes from Latin and means \\"beardless\\". Its closest relatives are thought to be the indigobirds and whydahs of the genus Vidua. These birds are now usually considered to form a family, Viduidae. Previously they were treated as a subfamily, Viduinae, within either the estrildid finch family, Estrildidae, or the weaver family, Ploceidae. Description The cuckoo-finch is a small finch-like bird, about 11‚Äì13 cm long. It has a short tail, large legs and feet, and a large, deep, conical bill. The adult male has a black bill and a yellow head and underparts. The upperparts are olive-green with black streaks. The yellow areas become increasingly bright prior to the breeding season as the feathers become worn. The adult female is buff with heavy black streaking above and light streaks on the flanks; its face is largely plain buff and the throat is buff-white. It has various chattering calls. Displaying males have a nasal song. Distribution and habitat The cuckoo-finch has a scattered distribution across sub-Saharan Africa where it occurs in open or lightly wooded grassland, especially near damp areas. In West Africa, it occurs in Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, eastern Nigeria, and north-west Cameroon with vagrant records from Gambia and Mali. Further east it is found in South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, southern and eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and locally in the Republic of the Congo. In southern Africa, it occurs in Malawi, Zambia, southern and eastern Angola, north-east Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, eastern South Africa, and Swaziland. It has a large range and an apparently stable population and so is classified as least concern by BirdLife International.BirdLife International (2009) [/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid;=8596&m;=0 Species factsheet: Anomalospiza imberbis]. Downloaded from on 17 January 2010. Behaviour Cuckoo-finch eggs (right two columns) closely resemble the eggs of their host species (tawny-flanked prinia and red-faced cisticola shown). The cuckoo-finch typically occurs in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season and larger flocks outside the breeding season. It forages on the ground or perched on the flower heads of grasses or herbs. It feeds mainly on grass seeds. The species is an obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of cisticolas and prinias. The eggs are white, pale blue or pink with brown, reddish or violet markings. They are 17‚Äì17.3 mm long and 12.5‚Äì13 mm wide. The eggs are incubated for 14 days. The young bird fledges after 18 days and remains dependent on its hosts for another 10‚Äì40 days. The young of the host bird usually disappear although there have been records of the host's nestlings surviving alongside the young cuckoo-finch. Sometimes two cuckoo- finch chicks have been found in the same nest.

The wattle becomes brighter during the breeding season. They have dark wings and a yellow belly, whereas the upperparts are grey to dusky brown. The female yellow wattlebird is much smaller than the male. The young yellow wattlebirds have much smaller wattles, a paler head, and a browner underbelly than the adult birds. The yellow wattlebird is similar in appearance to the little wattlebird and the red wattlebird. Distribution and Habitat Yellow wattlebirds are common in Tasmania, especially in the eastern and central areas. They are uncommon on King Island, and two possible sightings recorded on the southern Mornington Peninsula in Victoria lack material evidence. Yellow wattlebirds live in a variety of habitats including both dry and wet forests, and from sea level to the subalpine zone. They live in coastal heaths, forests and gardens near Eucalyptus trees. They also can be found in mountain shrubberies and open woodlands, particularly those dominated by Banksia. They have also been known to occur on golf courses, and in orchards, parks and gardens. Behaviour Yellow wattlebirds are active and acrobatic with a strong flight. They are fairly tame birds and often enter gardens looking for food. Harsh, raucous and grating, their calls have often been compared to a person coughing or belching, with a gurgling growk or repeated clok sound Yellow wattlebirds feed on the nectar of eucalypts and banksias, fruit, insects, spiders, honeydew,honey bees on the flight and manna (crystallised plant sap). They forage at all levels from the ground to the canopy. However, the blossoming of eucalyptus trees can be highly irregular in time and place, causing considerable changes from year to year in the breeding distribution of yellow wattlebirds, which rely on their nectar as a main source of food. Therefore, the most likely threat to the yellow wattlebird is unusual climatic conditions that can reduce food availability suddenly. Yellow wattlebirds can pollinate eucalyptus trees by carrying pollen in their bills or on the feathers of their heads. Breeding Yellow wattlebirds nest in breeding pairs and aggressively defend their territories from other birds. The nest of the yellow wattlebird is made by the female alone, and is a large, open saucer-shaped structure made of twigs and bark that are bound by wool. The inside of the nest is lined with wool and grass. The nests can be up to high and are found in trees or shrubs. Yellow wattlebirds lay 2‚Äì3 eggs that are salmon-red, spotted and blotched red-brown, purplish-red and blue-grey. Both the males and females incubate the egg and feed the young.

He was born in Michika, headquarters of the Michika Local Government Area (LGA), in what is now known as Adamawa State Northeast Nigeria. He attended his primary school and Secondary schools in Yola Middle School (now known as the General Murtala Mohammed College Yola) and done his post secondary education at the School for Arabic studies. He is married to four wives with 38 children, 17 boys and 21 girls, 105 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren, all from his four wives; Hajiya Daudu, Mairama, Aisha and Nana Saleh Michika of Algerian and Nigerien descent from Tamanrasset Province, Algeria.

Saleh Michika created a stir when he said in 1992 that he would be willing to relocate to the neighbouring Cameroun if there were a military coup in Nigeria. Fourteen years later, he made a controversial statement that the solution to the problems of corruption and misrule in the country would be a diarchy, a mixture of military and civilian personalities, with a military head of state. A pragmatist, before the 1993 elections he refused to meet Bashir Tofa, the presidential candidate of his NRC party, but he was helpful when M.K.O. Abiola, candidate of the rival Social Democratic Party (SDP) came to his state. However, in July 1993, after the Ibrahim Babangida administration had annulled Abiola's presidential election, he said \\"Much as I personally admired Moshood Abiola as an individual, the idea of a southern president was unrealistic\\". In January 2002, Michika described the National Assembly members as corrupt officials for whom he had no respect, and warned of the danger of another military coup. In October 2002, Saleh Michika was a strong contender to become the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) candidate for the Adamawa governorship. In 2005, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him as the chairman governing council of the Federal Polytechnic, Mubi In May 2006 a police corporal was killed by suspected armed bandits at his residence. However, the state commissioner of police, Alhaji Muhammad Sambo, said the attack was not an assassination attempt. The bandits just wanted to snatch the corporal's gun.

Retrieved 2011-06-24 Synopsis In the beginning, Xia Zhixing (Ah Xing) was a jewelry con artist, posing as various jewellery company representatives to trick customers into purchasing fake goods. Just like the boy who cried wolf, she had told one too many lies. As a result of this, she is caught for covering up for Shisan Ge (the man she ran off and started jewellery conning with many years ago) and is put in jail for a year. But when she crosses paths with Zhong Tianqi, a rebellious young master of a jewellery empire who is on the run having stolen an important jewel called the \\"Queen Mary\\" from his father's company, E-shine, the pair gradually become more and more involved with each other, though reluctantly at first. Ah Xing is drawn to him because, unlikely as it is, he seems to be the only one who believes in her. Eventually, several events after they first meet, they fall in love. However, because Tianqi is from a wealthy background and Ah Xing is not, his father will not let them see each other, provoking Tianqi to leave with Ah Xing in anger and demands he no longer wants to be part of the family company. He inspires Ah Xing to become a jewellery designer after seeing some of the forged copies she has produced, though Tianqi's father does everything he can to separate his son from the girl he sees as nothing but shameful. Ou Yaruo ‚Äî a worker at the company who previously had a relationship with Tianqi but then betrayed him by trying to marry his brother, Tianjun, because he was the first young master of Eshine ‚Äî is also hateful towards Ah Xing as she still has feelings for Tianqi. Tianjun, however, is in love with Ou Yaruo but knows she does not love him back. Tianqi is a passionate and skilled racer and helps to save the residents of Tomorrow Town (Ah Xing's hometown) from the gang led by Fa Ge, where he is seen as a local hero afterward. After Tianqi is brutally beaten up when they aim to seek revenge on him, Ah Xing agrees on Tianqi's father's orders not to see Tianqi anymore when she sees how much pain he has had to suffer because of her. Tianqi is told he cannot race in the future due to a broken hand. Once Tianqi has recovered, Ah Xing throws away the blue sapphire earring Tianqi presented to her when they first fell in love to convince him that her feelings now are real. Tianqi searches through the rain for the earring but cannot find it and is then led away by Ou Yaruo when he starts to become agitated. Ah Xing has a change of heart and tries to tell Tianqi she's sorry but the car is already driving away. Tianqi learns his father is suffering from Parkinson's disease and tries for his family's sake to forget about Ah Xing. But he still has strong feelings for her no matter how hard he tries, so does not and cannot give up on their love. In the end she agrees to meet him at the cable cars in Tomorrow Town as she, too, cannot hide the way she feels. Tianjun drives Ah Xing to meet Tianqi, not realising that Ou Yaruo has tampered with the car as she thought her father would be driving it. The car crashes, killing Tianjun and leaving Ah Xing crawling on her knees to find help. Meanwhile, Tianqi waits for Ah Xing to arrive, which she never does. He finds out about his brother's death and from then on blames Ah Xing for leaving Tianjun to die and breaking his heart. He vows he will never forgive her and will hate her forever. 5 years later, Zhong Tianqi is a changed man. He is now the ruthless young boss of Eshine, and has become very cold and bitter since his brother and father's deaths. Ah Xing is living with her uncle, Guang Ming, and is the guardian of Shisan Ge's 5-year-old daughter, Nini, because he is in prison and cannot look after her. Nini is eager for Ah Xing to accompany her to meet the famous superstar Han Zhiyin who just so happens to have signed a contract with Eshine. Ah Xing agrees to go and as a result ends up winning the chance to spend 8 hours handcuffed to Han Zhiyin. This leads to Ah Xing and Tianqi becoming reunited after several long years during which he publicly reveals his hate about her and what type of person he has been led to believe she is. He still believes she was the one who killed his brother and vows to find out the truth. However, his old feelings are rekindled and he finds himself falling for her all over again, after the pair are involved in several events together. During this, Han Zhiyin discovers that Tianqi is his older half-brother because of a secret romance between Tianqi's father and Han Zhiyin's mother many years ago. Han Zhiyin feels resentment and jealousy towards Tianqi because Tianqi had been brought up well by their father (who abandoned Han Zhiyin and his mother and wanted nothing to do with them), whereas Han Zhiyin lived most of his life on the streets before becoming a celebrity. The two newly discovered brothers fight for Ah Xing's love for a while, but Ah Xing tells Han Zhiyin that what he feels for her isn't real and that he is just trying to take what Tianqi has for his own. Tianqi and Ah Xing have a fight about the contract they signed, but it was a misunderstanding. Tianqi was trying to make a new contract with Ah Xing which she could never break. That was to marry Tianqi. Tianqi also learns the truth about that fateful day in which Tianjun died but does not blame Ou Yaruo for it. As they stand by Tianjun's grave, Ou Yaruo allows herself to be escorted away by the police because she says that with Tianjun by her side, she is not afraid. She puts on the wedding ring that Tianjun presented to her before his death and recalls the memory of his proposal. The drama ends 2 months later where Han Zhiyin is running Eshine and Ah Xing is revealed to be pregnant with Tianqi's child. Han Zhiyin refuses to give Tianqi a 10-month break so easily. He challenges Tianqi to one last car race to determine who will run the company for the next 5 years.

The concept is that internal abatement of emissions should take precedence before external participation in flexible mechanisms. These mechanisms include emissions trading, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). Emissions trading basically refers to the trading of emissions allowances (carbon credits) between one regulated entity and a less pollutive entity. This trading of permits results in a marginal economic disincentive to the buyer and a marginal economic incentive the abater. CDM and JI are flexible mechanisms based on the concept of a carbon project. These projects reduce GHG voluntarily (outside the capped sectors) and therefore can be imported into the capped sector to aid in compliance. The supplementarity principle is found in three articles of the Kyoto Protocol: article 6 and 17 with regards to trading, and article 12 with regards to the clean development mechanism. Article 6.1 states that \\"The acquisition of emission reduction units shall be supplemental to domestic actions for the purposes of meeting commitments under Article 3\\". Article 17 states that \\"[‚Ä¶]Any such trading shall be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under that article\\". Article 12.3.b states that \\"Parties included in Annex I may use the certified emission reductions accruing from such project activities to contribute to compliance with part of their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3[‚Ä¶]\\". The actual meaning of the principle has been heavily argued since the signing of Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The COP/MOP is the body that represents the signers/ratifiers of the protocol and they have not been able to agree on a specific definition of the limit on use of flexible mechanisms. The original text has been interpreted to mean that anywhere from 3-50% of emissions could be offset by trading mechanisms. However, the only determination that has been thustly made is that the actual value of supplementarity should be decided at the country level. In the United States RGGI (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) has set a precedent in that it will initially allow only up to 3.3% compliance occur by means of offset projects (carbon projects). This value can increase to 5% and ultimately 10% if certain price thresholds are exceeded in the region.

It is found in plains and open countryside in southern and eastern Africa. The IUCN has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern. Taxonomy This species was described by English naturalist George Ernest Shelley in 1900. The IOC World Bird List recognises five subspecies: A. v. chobiensis in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, southwestern Tanzania, northeastern Namibia, northern Botswana, Zimbabwe and western Mozambique; A. v. neumanni in central Angola; A. v. namibicus in northeastern and central Namibia; A. v. exasperatus in northeastern Botswana; and A. v. vaalensis in southern Botswana and South Africa. A. longicaudatus is an invalid taxon and is included in A. vaalensis. Some authors include subspecies saphiroi and goodsoni of the plain-backed pipit (Anthus leucophrys) in this species. Description Its length is , and its weight is . It is often confused with the plain-backed pipit because both species have plain upperparts. The upperparts of the buffy pipit are paler and buffier than the plain-backed pipit. The buffy pipit has a pale supercilium, and its lower mandible has a pinkish base. It has faint markings on the breast, and the belly and flanks are buffy. The juvenile has mottles. Distribution and habitat The buffy pipit is found in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with a distribution size estimated at . Its habitat is semi-arid plains with grasses and bare ground. It also occurs in pastures, burnt fields, and edges of saltpans. Behaviour One or two individuals are usually encountered, but flocks may be found in winter. It frequently wags its tail. Its song is a repeated tchreep-churup, and the call sshik is given when the bird is flushed. It eats invertebrates and seeds. Breeding has been recorded from July to February in Zimbabwe and August to December in South Africa. The nest is an open cup built on the ground. Status The population size is not known. The species has an increasing population trend and a large range, so the IUCN Red List has assessed the species as least concern.

Antilophia are the only genus of manakin with dichromatic (two-coloured) male plumage.  Taxonomy  The Helmeted manakin is a member of Pipridae, a family of small Neotropical songbirds. The Helmeted manakin and the critically endangered Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermann) are the only members of the genus Antilophia. Antilophia are very closely related to Chiroxiphia, another genus of manakin which inhabit rainforests in Central and South America. There is possible hybridization between the two genera where their distributions overlap.  Habitat and Distribution  Helmeted manakins are endemic to the Cerrado savanna ecosystems of central Brazil as well as pockets in northeast Paraguay and Bolivia. They are often found near bodies of water in gallery forests. The seasonally dry Cerrado is an unusual habitat for Pipridae, a family that typically occupies lush rainforests. Within its atypical habitat the Helmeted manakin is fairly abundant. Although its populations are on the decline, due to its large distribution the Helmeted manakin is considered of least concern by the IUNC.  Behaviour   Vocalizations  The Helmeted manakin has a sonorous song that has been likened to that of a cotinga. The male song is a whistle composed of eight notes. The song is loud enough to be perceived by the human ear up to 100m away in the forest. Males sing year- round, but song-intensity is highest from July to November.  Diet  Like most Pipridae manakins are primarily a frugivorous species, though populations of Helmeted manakins in gallery forests near Capetinga, Brazil have been documented gleaning and sallying insects. Fruit availability in the Cerrado savanna ecosystems is highly seasonal; fruiting peaks in the wet season, and diminishes by 80% in the dry season. Accordingly, Helmeted manakin foraging habits vary seasonally. In the wet season they forage primarily in the canopy and are selective in their choice of fruit, preferentially foraging for the highest quality fruit. In the dry season they forage in the understory and are less choosy with the fruit species they consume. Helmeted manakins are important seed dispersers for a number of fruiting plants in the Cerrado. Helmeted manakins have been observed participating in mixed-species flocks with other passerine birds.  Reproduction  The reproductive period for males stretches from July to December, with a peak in singing intensity and courtship displays in August and September. Female reproductive period begins in August and ends in December. Like many Pipridae the Helmeted manakin is a promiscuous species; males and females are non-monogamous and can have multiple mates. During the breeding season males frequent multiple leks to perform for different females. Mixed-paternity has been documented in chicks from the same nest, indicating females may choose multiple mates.  Territoriality  In the wet season males establish feeding territories and defend them from other males. In the dry season, when food is less abundant, territorial boundaries dissipate and home range overlap between individuals increases. Subadult males occasionally sing and engage in territorial behaviour. Home ranges of males and females are large (on average 16 to 20 hectares during the breeding season) and overlap considerably with one another.  Courtship  Like all members of Pipridae male Helmeted manakins gather in leks during the mating season where they perform a courtship display for an onlooking female. The female Helmeted manakin initiates the courtship display with short call. Up to six prospective males gather in a single lek in the forest canopy. The Helmeted manakin's mating display is unusually subdued for a Pipridae, a family characterized by their complex and flashy courtship performances. The male birds initiate a series of chase-flights, during which they disappear into the canopy in mutual pursuit. After completing a circuit the males return to the lek before repeating the chase-flight performance again. Subadult males have been observed participating in courtship displays.  Nests  Nests are bowl-shaped and assembled from twigs and roots. The outside of the nest is decorated with dry leaves while the inside is lined with horsehair fungus. Nests are typically constructed up to 3m off the ground in shrubs or other vegetation. Nests are usually secured within a forked branch and are attached using spider silk. Clutches always consist of two eggs, which are yellowish-white in colour with irregular spots, blotches or streaks. Male Helmeted manakins contribute no parental care; females are solely responsible for constructing and cleaning the nest.

The firewood-gatherer is a brown bird with a long tail, streaked with darker brown, with a whitish eyestripe and some white on the tail. The strident call is uttered as a monotone chick-chick-chicl-chee-ee-ee- ee-ee. Both males and females vocalise, including from the nest. It typically inhabits open, bushy countryside, pasture and cropland, and even relatively unvegetated areas with scattered thistles and clumps of foliage. It is quite bold, sitting on fencing posts or wires, and walking about inconspicuously on the ground. It usually occurs singly or in pairs, and only at the end of the breeding season can more than two birds be seen at one time. It feeds on insects, beetles, flies and their larvae, and seeds. It got its name because it is frequently seen carrying sticks to its nest. It interweaves thorny twigs to build its globular nest, which has an entrance tunnel and can be up to tall, and decorated with glass or threads. The bulky nests are very durable and are used from year to year. The young from the first brood may be ejected from the territory, but may help raise the second brood.

Superficially finch-like in appearance, this insectivorous bird is relatively common throughout most of its range, however, overall populations appear to be in decline. Taxonomy Originally classified as genus Xerophila, the whitefaces were later reclassified when it was noted that a group of molluscs had already been ascribed that name and thus, are now listed as genus Aphelocephala. There are three species within the Aphelocephala, including the southern whiteface, banded whiteface (A. nigricincta) and chestnut-breasted whiteface (A. pectoralis). The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek apheles 'simple' and kephale 'head'. The specific epithet derives from Ancient Greek leukos 'white' and opsis 'face'. Recent phylogenetic study has found whitefaces to be most closely related to the scrubtit (Acanthornis magnus), a monotypic Tasmanian species similar in appearance to Sericornis scrubwrens. The marked difference in the size and shape of the whiteface beak compared with that of the scrubtit has been attributed to an increased dietary intake of seeds, requiring a more robust bill. Description The southern whiteface is a stocky thornbill-like bird with a brown dorsum, white belly, dark brown wings and a black tail with narrow white tip. A grey wash on the belly is sometimes present, along with a grey or rufous tinge to the flanks. This species displays the characteristic facial markings of the genus; a white band across the forehead, with a darker streak along the top edge. Adult birds are approximately in length with a cream coloured eye, grey legs and a stubby dark grey bill of finch-like appearance. Adults are sexually monomorphic, while juveniles are distinguishable due to a lack of black rear band on the face. Call is a rapid, noisy twittering \\"tchip-tchip-chiptchipt-chipt-chip\\" or \\"tzip-tzip-tziptzip\\" and a harsher \\"kzzurrk, kzzurrk-kzzurrk\\" in alarm. This species can be distinguished from other whiteface species by its somewhat duller appearance and lack of a breast band, which both the banded whiteface and chestnut- breasted whiteface possess. The southern whiteface is a polytypic species with two recognised races: * A. l. leucopsis; the nominate race found throughout south-eastern and central Australia. This race varies in the degree of grey colouration on the flanks, becoming progressively paler with north-westerly distribution. The pale form was previously considered a separate race; whitei. * A. l. castaneiventris; found in south Western Australia, this race is distinguishable by a rufous wash to its flanks. Distribution and habitat The southern whiteface is endemic to Australia and typically inhabits arid open woodlands with a shrubby or grassy understory, as well as grass plains throughout much of the continents south. Not present in Tasmania or in coastal areas of the mainland, this species prefers Acacia woodlands, particularly those dominated by mulga and drought-resistant chenopod shrub species, including saltbush and bluebush. They are considered sedentary; however, atlas records indicate that individuals may move into wetter areas outside of their normal range during drought years. Behaviour  Diet and foraging  Southern whiteface feed primarily on arthropods; particularly insect and arachnid species, but also take seeds and leaves. They forage almost exclusively on the ground, favouring habitat with low tree densities, a herb understory and without large amounts of litter cover. When foraging on ground substrates, southern whiteface preferentially make use of ground litter, herbs and bare ground over grass and substrates above ground level (e.g., tree trunks, branches and canopy) and obtain their insectivorous prey exclusively by gleaning. Although southern whiteface typically forage in small groups of 2-8 individuals, they may congregate in larger flocks during the non-breeding season, with as many as 70 birds recorded in foraging parties in winter. They often also participate in mixed species feeding flocks, particularly with other whiteface and thornbill species.  Breeding  Breeds once or twice a year from July to October throughout most of its range, however, timing of breeding in this species can be affected by rainfall in arid regions. May breed outside of their usual season following sufficient rainfall, or may not breed at all in years of drought. Little is known about bonding in this species and although nesting is often observed in pairs, there have been multiple occurrences of co-operative breeding recorded, with up to 4 adults participating in chick rearing.  Nesting  Builds a domed nest with a side entrance, using dry grasses or bark and lining with feathers or fur. Nests are often placed in shrubs or tree hollows and can range in height from less than 1m from the ground, to greater than . Eggs are a dull white or buff colour with brown blotching at the larger end, oval in shape and about in size. Clutches usually consist of 3-4 eggs. Length of incubation period is unknown, but young are altricial and fledge between 14‚Äì19 days after hatching. Conservation Although locally common and currently listed on the IUCN Red List as of least concern, atlas records of southern whiteface have declined by 43% in recent years. The suitability of habitat for ground-foraging woodland species, such as the southern whiteface, is thought to depend on the variety of available ground substrates. As many types of ground cover are vulnerable to disturbance from fire (leaf litter, fallen branches), grazing (grass, herbs) and introduction of exotic plant species (open ground), the management of existing habitat has important conservation implications for this species. Understory disturbance by grazing and clearance of habitat for agriculture are currently listed as the main threats to southern whiteface. However, some studies suggest that mining operations may also impact negatively on the species, although the exact cause for their decline (e.g. habitat degradation, noise disturbance, exposure to pollutants) in mining areas is unknown.

The three species are collectively known as whitefaces. They are endemic to Australia, generally occurring in the arid centre of the continent. They are a striking looking bird, particularly compared to their duller looking relatives, having dark upperparts and white breasts and faces (as suggested by the name). Two species, the chestnut-breasted and banded whitefaces, break up the white undersides with a darker band (or double band). The three species have stubby bills and unlike the rest of the Acanthizidae they consume large numbers of seeds in their diet. The genus had been originally described as Xerophila by John Gould, however Harry Church Oberholser pointed out that this genus name had been given to a genus of mollusc.

It is endemic to dryer regions of Australia. The ornithologist Alfred John North described the banded whiteface as Xerophila nigricincta in 1895, from specimens collected at Missionary Plains, Northern Territory. Harry Church Oberholser pointed out that this genus name was invalid as it had been given to a genus of mollusc, hence it gained its current name Aphelocephala nigricincta in 1899. Description The adult banded whiteface is around 10 cm (4 in) long. The upper parts of the body and head are greyish brown. The face has a white mask bordered by a darker band which runs vertically across the region of the eyes. The upper breast is pale blue-grey and the underparts white, separated by a prominent black band across the breast. There are red-brown patches on the flanks. The bill and legs are black and the eyes are white. The plumage of male and female are alike and juveniles are duller. Behaviour Like the other birds in its genus, the banded whiteface hops over open ground in pairs or small groups foraging for seeds and insects. Nesting takes place in winter from July to September or after a period of rain. Located on the ground near shrubs, the round hollow nest is constructed of twigs and grass and has a long tubular entrance. Both the nest and the tunnel are lined with flowers and feathers. The clutch consists of three or four matte white eggs with brown blotches mostly at the larger end. Tapered oval in shape, they are around 17 mm long by 13 mm wide. The banded whiteface has been reported to enter torpor at night in winter months, reawakening as it warms in the morning. Distribution and habitat A nomadic or sedentary species moving according to seasonal conditions, the banded whiteface is found in a very large range from southwestern Queensland across dryer parts of central and southern Australia into mid-Western Australia. It inhabits mulga woodland, gibber plains and sandhills, and frequents saltbush and spinifex.

It is endemic to Australia and found primarily in northern South Australia. Habitat The species's preferred habitat is open terrain in hilly areas such as tablelands, with a stony landscape and a patchy cover of perennial chenopod shrubs. The species is most frequently seen in areas where the topographic relief gives rise to creek lines, in which there tends to be denser shrubby vegetation. It feeds on the ground and takes seeds and arthropods. It is threatened by habitat loss. Bulgunnia Station in the North West region of the state is a stronghold for the species and has been classified as an Important Bird Area. Threats Grazing by livestock and rabbits is the primary long-term threat as it reduces the recruitment of perennial shrubs, particularly low bluebush Maireana astrotricha, upon which the species depends. Heavy grazing of the chenopod shrubland has almost certainly caused the species to vacate previously used sites. Ironically, a recent reduction in rabbit numbers may have allowed a sufficient buildup of fuel for fire to be a threat, particularly if occurring over a large area simultaneously. Some patches of habitat are threatened by opal mining. There has been a large increase in mining activity in South Australia in recent years, some of which is known to have directly impacted areas that have supported relatively high densities of the species.

This thorn-tail is believed to be used, not to aid in climbing trees as in other funariids like the tit-spinetails, but to attract the opposite sex during courtship.

Ibis. 152:761‚Äì774. creating considerable gene flow when most of the ice sheet melted. Behaviour and ecology Like most furnariids, the thorn- tailed rayadito is exclusively insectivorous, and like the tits of the northern hemisphere it searches bark and moss surfaces for small insects. In the non-breeding season from March to September it forms large flocks with other Furnariidae species, though generally it is so numerous as to outnumber all other species combined and in almost half of all cases rayaditos are the only species present: at other times white-throated treerunners, striped woodpeckers and fire-eyed diucons may complement them. Rayaditos themselves usually occur in the non-breeding season in flocks of four to seven; however in the breeding season from October to February they are strongly pair- territorial. Rayaditos are highly curious and fearless birds, and are inquisitive in the presence of humans in their forest habitat. They are adaptable to quite a wide range of forest types, from tall Nothofagus and Araucaria forests in the north to low subantarctic forests in the far south and relatively dry Austrocedrus forests in the east of their range. Rayaditos do not extend beyond the relatively dry cedar forest into the \\"scrub beech\\" further east,Ralph, C. John; \\"Habitat association patterns of forest and steppe birds of northern Patagonia, Argentina\\" in The Condor, Vol. 87, No. 4 (November, 1985), pp. 471-483 and generally do require corridors of considerable size if not so wide as many other endemic birds of Patagonian forests. Rayadito Portrait Reproduction The breeding biology of the thorn-tailed rayadito is the most comprehensively studied among the generally little-known avifauna of South America south of the Amazon Basin.Russell, Eleanor M.; \\"Avian Life Histories: Is Extended Parental Care the Southern Secret?\\"; in Emu; Vol. 100, 377-399 (2000) Rayaditos, unlike most other furnariids, nest in secondary cavities in old trees, though there are a few reports that in the extreme south of their range they will opportunistically choose to nest in ground level cavitiesMcGehee, Steven M., Eitniear, Jack C., & Glickman, Barry W.; \\"Unusual ground level tree cavity nesting in the Thorn- tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda)\\" in Bolet√≠n SAO Vol. 20 (No. 1) ‚Äì Pag: 12-17 and they willingly accept nest boxes. Rayaditos breed between October and January, typically laying three or four eggs. Occasionally more are laid though there is little evidence more than four young ever fledge from a nest. The most striking feature of rayaditos and indeed most furnariids is the very large size of the eggs: though not as large as those of the related Des Murs's wiretail, they are still about fifty percent larger than expected for an 11-gram passerine.Based on the formula of egg mass = 0.258m0.73, where m is body mass.

Because of their large eggs, rayadito females (and indeed all other documented furnariids) lay eggs only every other day, akin to other south temperate passerines like the rifleman and thornbills, though their incubation periods are not as long.Ricklefs, R.E.; \\"Sibling competition, hatching asynchrony, incubation period, and lifespan in altricial birds\\"; in Power, Dennis M.

Growth of nestlings is distinctly slow: fledging lasts twenty-one days and postfledging parental care around thirty days. The latter is distinctly longer than in north temperate species at the same distance from the equator, but not nearly so long as in many tropical, Australian and southern African passerinesSee McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.; Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges; where young are not independent for over sixty days.

Several other island forms are noted: * cinireicollis (Vieillot, 1819) - south of the Isthmus of Kra to Sumatra and satellite islands * zarhina Oberholser, 1912 - Banyak Is, off W Sumatra. * niasensis van Oort, 1910 - Nias I, off W Sumatra. * rothschildi van Oort, 1910 - N Natuna Is. * atita Oberholser, 1932 - S Natuna Is. * buettikoferi van Oort, 1910 - Borneo. * prillwitzi Hartert, 1901 - Java (including Madura I) and Bali * randi Salomonsen, 1953 - Basilan (off W Mindanao). Distribution and habitat The species is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Within India, there are disjunct populations in the Eastern Ghats from Lamasinghi, Visakhapatnam and parts of Orissa) and the Western Ghats apart from the main distribution in north-east India that extends into Southeast Asia. A record from the Nicobar Islands is considered doubtful. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is usually found below the canopy. They are also found in gardens, attracted especially by flowers that yield nectar. Behaviour and ecology Song of the Western Ghats race The egg is pinkish marked with darker red They have been noted as good pollinators of wild banana species and several species of the ginger family and often visit Loranthus sp. (= Dendrophthoe sp.), Indian silk cotton tree and Indian coral tree for nectar. They are often seen in plantations in forest areas. Although they are more often seen in secondary forests or in clearings and appear to be tolerant of human activities, they have become extinct in some forest fragments. In Singapore they have gone locally extinct within the botanical garden. The breeding season in northeastern India is March to September but mainly May to August. In southern India it breeds from December to August. Two eggs are the usual clutch. The nest is a compact cup attached under a leaf of banana or similar broad leaved plant. The nest is suspended from the underside of the leaf using 150 or so \\"pop-rivets\\" of cobwebs and vegetable fibre, a unique method of using spider silk for animal architecture. It is suspected that Hodgson's hawk-cuckoo and violet cuckoo are brood parasites on this species in India. Calls A species of haemosporidian, Leucocytozoon, has been noted in specimens from Malaysia. In culture In Sarawak, the Kayan, Kenyah and Punan people consider it a bird of good omen and when they are out collecting camphor, the men would wait until they heard the sit call of one of these spiderhunters.

It is endemic to coastal Queensland in Australia. Along Pinnacle Road - Australia (flash photo) Taxonomy and systematics The pied monarch was described by John Gould in 1851, who deliberated on placing it in a genus by itself on account of its feet and eye ring. The nest and eggs were undescribed until collected by Robert Hislop on 3 December 1894 near Bloomfield River. Illustration by John Gould The pied monarch is closely related to and forms a superspecies with the two other species of monarch flycatcher in the genus Arses. Two subspecies are recognised, however they two intergrade where their ranges meet at Mossman, and they could be treated as a monotypic species. The monarch flycatchers are classified either as a subfamily Monarchinae, together with the fantails as part of the drongo family Dicruridae, or as a family Monarchidae in its own right. Molecular research in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed the monarchs belong to a large group of mainly Australasian birds known as the Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines.Sibley, Charles Gald & Ahlquist, Jon Edward (1990): Phylogeny and classification of birds. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn. More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat as the monarchs have been classified in a 'Core corvine' group with the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, fantails, drongos and mudnest builders. Alternate names include the Australian pied flycatcher, Australian pied monarch, banded monarch, pied monarch-flycatcher, black-breasted flycatcher, Kaup's flycatcher and pied flycatcher. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognized: * A. k. terraereginae - Campbell, AJ, 1895: Found on eastern Cape York Peninsula (north-eastern Australia) * A. k. kaupi - Gould, 1851: Found on south-eastern Cape York Peninsula (north-eastern Australia) Description The pied monarch is in length and weighs around . The plumage is sexually dimorphic. The upperparts and head of the male are black, as is the tail, and the wings are brownish-black with white scapulars (which shows as a white crescent across the back when folded). The collar, which is erectable, is white, and it joins through the neck with a white throat. The breast-band is black, and the belly and underside are white. In the female the white on the throat and collar is less distinct and covers less area, and the collar is incomplete around the neck. The eye is black, and is surrounded by a blue coloured eye-ring, which is less distinct in the female. The bill is blue- grey, and the legs are black. Immature birds look like females but with duller plumage, no blue in the eye-rings, and a horn-coloured bill. Like other members of the genus it has long hind-toes and claws, and in general the size and shape of the feet resemble those of the Australasian treecreepers, and the feet are used for feeding in the same manner on the trunks of trees. Distribution and habitat The pied monarch is found in tropical forest edge habitats and secondary growth in coastal north eastern Queensland, from Cooktown to Ingham. It ranges from sea level up to . It also occurs in palm- vine scrub, gallery forest and along rivers. The species is mostly non- migratory, but some birds disperse to the Eucalyptus woodland in the Atherton Tableland during the winter. The species has a tiny global range, and is described as uncommon and occurring at low densities throughout its range. However much of its range is protected within national parks or World Heritage Sites, and its habitat is thought to be secure. The species is considered to be safe at the moment, and is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Behaviour The pied monarch is insectivorous, with beetles (Coleoptera) and moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) being recorded in its diet. It is usually seen as singles or pairs and small groups (of three to five birds, which may be family groups). They join mixed-species foraging flocks with other monarch flycatchers, fantails, whistlers and shrikethrushes. Within the forest they usually feed at the mid level, and rarely close to the ground. One foraging method typical to the genus is to climb up trunks and the larger branches in the manner of a treecreeper (Climacteris) and probing the bark and lichens, but they also catch prey from the air. Breeding Breeding season is October to January with one brood raised. The nest is a shallow cup made of vines and sticks, woven together with spider webs and shredded plant material, and decorated with lichen on the outside. It is generally sited on a hanging loop of vine well away from the trunk or foliage of a sizeable tree about above the ground. Two pink-tinged oval white eggs splotched with lavender and reddish- brown are laid measuring 19 mm x 14 mm.

Founded at the end of the 18th century, it developed land on the south slope of Beacon Hill into a desirable residential neighborhood. History In 1795 a syndicate formed by Harrison Gray Otis sought to speculate on land development around the newly formed government buildings on Boston's Beacon Hill. The Mount Vernon Proprietors, as the group was named, included founders Otis, Jonathan Mason, Joseph Woodward and Charles Ward Apthorp.Samuel Eliot Morison. Harrison Gray Otis, 1765-1848: The Urbane Federalist. 1969; p.529. Membership in the Proprietors changed frequently but partners included Charles Bulfinch, Hepzibah Swan, Henry Jackson, Dr. Benjamin Joy, William Scollay.Allan Chamberlain. Beacon Hill: Its Ancient Pastures and Early Mansions. 1925. As probably the first organized real estate syndicate in Colonial America, the Proprietors' contribution to real estate development formulated the model by which much of America was built. The Proprietors purchased an cow pasture for the total sum of $18,450 from the esteemed painter John Singleton Copley who was living in England at the time. The Copley tract comprised an area of Beacon Hill now bound by Beacon Street, Walnut Street and Mount Vernon Street and the area called Louisburg Square. After agreeing to the sale, Copley reconsidered the offer and tried unsuccessfully for ten years to break the sale contract. Once the sale was upheld, architect Charles Bulfinch set out to pattern streets, design mansions, and create an elegant urban setting. Houses associated with the Proprietors that survive to the present day include: * 29A Chestnut Street. Built \\"on spec\\" by the Proprietors in 1799. * 13, 15, 17 Chestnut Street. Built by Hepzibah Swan, 1804-1805. The houses from 70 through 75 Beacon Street, Boston, opposite the Boston Public Garden, were built by the Mount Vernon Proprietors in 1828, on a speculative basis. They have a continuous granite facade. The architect was Asher Benjamin (1773‚Äì1845).

Great woodswallows are found as high as , but are most abundant between and . Unlike the Australian dusky woodswallow,Maddocks, Tracy A. and Geiser, Fritz; ‚ÄúHeterothermy in an Australian passerine, the Dusky Woodswallow (Artamus cyanopterus)‚Äù; in Journal of Ornithology, Volume 148, Issue 4(October 2007); pp. 571-577 great woodswallows do not reduce their body temperature on cool nights. Behaviour and breeding Like its smaller relatives, the great woodswallow is a fast-flying aerial insectivore feeding chiefly on large flying insects. It is generally regarded as the smallest bird in the world that habitually soars on updrafts over long distances, but it will also use its feet to manipulate its insect prey. Great woodswallows are highly social, flying in flocks of up to twenty birds, and nomadic over their montane forest habitat. It is common for very close ‚Äúknots‚Äù of the species to allopreen on small posts for up to ten minutes. They usually breed between August and December, and the nest is like other woodswallows: a flat platform of grass or twigs in a tree hole or stump, though higher above the ground than other species in the genus. Great woodswallows are cooperative breeders, with most young adults remaining for a number of years with their parents to raise young.

It is endemic to most of the islands of Fiji, although it is absent from Kadavu Archipelago and the Lau Archipelago.Clunie, F. (1976) \\"Behaviour and Nesting of the Fijian White-breasted Woodswallows\\" Notornis 23: 61-75 The species was once considered a race of the white-breasted woodswallow,Watling, D. (2001). A Guide to the Birds of Fiji and Western Polynesia. Environmental Consultants, Suva. which breeds from Australia, New Caledonia and Vanuatu through to Borneo and the Philippines. Some authors retain it in that species.Steadman D, (2006). Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds, University of Chicago Press. The Fiji woodswallow is a chunky bird 18 centimetres (7 in) long with a heavy black-tipped blue bill.Pratt, H., Bruner, P & Berrett, D. (1987) The Birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific Princeton University Press:Princeton The plumage is sooty dark above, with a white belly, rump and throat. It is distinguished from the white-breasted woodswallow by the amount of white on the throat, which in the Fiji woodswallow comes up to the level of the bill. Distribution and habitat The Fiji woodswallow is endemic to the major islands of Fiji, namely Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and Taveuni. It is absent from the fourth largest island, Kadavu, but is present on smaller Gau in the Lomaiviti Archipelago. Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests and savannahs, but it has adjusted to human-altered habitats and also lives in cultivated areas; there are even urban populations in Suva and Nadi. In Viti Levu it is found in the highlands, but not on the highlands of Taveuni.Blackburn, A. (1971) \\"Some notes on Fijian birds\\" Notornis 18(3): 147‚Äì174 Unlike the nomadic populations of Australian white-breasted woodswallows, the Fiji woodswallow is sedentary. Family groups will occupy a tree in which they roost and nest in over several years. It is thought that this is because the climatic conditions in Fiji are less extreme. Diet The Fiji woodswallow feeds on insects, with moths, butterflies, dragonflies, and grasshoppers being the main prey taken. Most of the prey is obtained by hawking, with birds sitting on prominent perches and sallying after flying insect prey. Prey is usually taken out in the open away from obstacles but is occasionally taken from near the ground. Alternatively the woodswallow may make sweeps over flowering plants and snap at insects. It seldom lands to catch prey. Smaller items of prey are swallowed whole, whereas larger items are taken to a perch and dismembered, with the insect held on the perch with a foot and pecked apart. The wings of some species, such as dragonflies, are often stripped off before swallowing. Family groups will feed each other during the breeding season, and injured birds are fed while they recover. Social behaviour The Fiji goshawk is a predator of the Fiji woodswallow and is aggressively mobbed by it Fiji woodswallows are highly social and will often form clusters on perches. At night groups habitually roost in the forks of a nesting/roosting tree, except during storms when they roost further down the tree. Fiji woodswallows are preyed upon by the Fiji race of the peregrine falcon and the young are vulnerable to the Fiji goshawk.Clunie, F (1973) \\"Nest helpers at White-breasted Woodswallow nest\\" Notornis 20: 378-380 Fiji woodswallows are highly aggressive and will attack these raptors, often at risk to themselves, as well as introduced mammals such as cats and dogs. They will also harass the introduced common myna and red- vented bulbul to drive away from nesting and roosting sites, but display less aggression towards other harmless native species such as the Fiji parrotfinch. Breeding A few studies of this species suggest that it has an unusual polygynandrous breeding system, in contrast to the white-breasted woodswallow, which is socially monogamous. Two males and two females have been observed building the nest, incubating the eggs and raising the young. It is not known if both the females lay or if only the dominant one does, but copulation has been recorded as occurring \\"indiscriminately\\" between different members of the group. The nesting season begins in May, with nest building beginning then. Nest building is a communal activity, with all members of the group participating.

Jan Palfijn (name sometimes spelled Jean Palfyn or Jan Palfyn) (28 November 1650 ‚Äì 21 April 1730) was a Flemish surgeon and obstetrician who was a native of Kortrijk, Flanders. He practiced medicine in Ypres and Paris, and in 1697 moved to Ghent, where he remained for the rest of his career. Palfijn is remembered for introducing the obstetrical forceps (Main de Palfijn) into medicine in the early 1720s. Palfijn's forceps initially had a problem because the two separate halves occasionally shifted during use. Later the two halves of the forceps were linked by a hinge to correct the problem. Statue of Jan Palfyn (1650-1730) at Kortrijk (Schouwburgplein), Belgium In 1718 Palfijn published an influential work for surgeons called l'Anatomie du corps humain (Anatomy of the human body). Reportedly, this book was still in use in Japan in the latter part of the 19th century. Today in Ghent there are the Palfijn Medical Museum and the Jan Palfijn Hospital.

Description  A.personatus is a common, gregarious and highly nomadic species, appearing in large flocks usually with white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus). Among the few passerines that have powder down through their plumage. Listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  Field identification  217x217pxRanging from 18‚Äì20 cm in length with a wingspan of 32‚Äì34 cm, weighing approximately 37 grams, the masked woodswallow is similar in size to the white-browed woodswallow. Sexes differ markedly in colour and also in immature plumage. This difference between sexes is unique only to the masked woodswallow and white-browed woodswallow. Adult males have a sharply defined black face mask with a pale edge. This mask covers the lores, ear coverts, chin and throat. Upperparts are dark blue grey with a prominent white tip on the tail. The underbody is pale grey, fading to greyish white on under tail coverts. Legs and feet are grey to grey black or black. Adult females are similar to adult males but slightly browner and mask is indistinct. Juveniles are similar to adult females but slightly browner with fletched and mottled buff.  Ecology   Diet  A.personatus is a mainly insectivorous species that has been observed to hawk or pounce on its prey. Nectar also comprises part of its diet and has been observed occasionally eating fruit.  Breeding  Exclusively pair breeders, consistent with being migratory. A.personatus shows no ecological segregation with A.supercilious but no co operative breeding has been recorded as with other Artamus species. A.personatus breeds throughout most of its distribution range with the exception of eastern and south eastern coastal areas and north of latitude 20¬∞. Usually breeds during spring and summer with annual variation. Breeding frequency is usually once, occasionally twice a year.  Nesting  Similar to the nest of white-breasted woodswallow (Artamus leucorynchus) but less substantial. Usually only one to two metres above the ground, often only a shallow, frail bowl. Has been recorded in stumps, fallen limbs, bush or scrub, fence posts and protruding bark. Nest materials include twigs and grass, with an upper layer of dry or green grass. Both sexes build the nest.  Eggs  Pale greyish white to pale greenish grey to light creamy brown. Measuring approximately 22mm x 17mm, usual shape, tapered oval. Indistinguishable from the White-browed Woodswallow. 2-3 per clutch, less commonly 1-4.  Distribution and Habitat  Widespread on mainland Australia, less common in coastal and near coastal areas, Vagrants have been recorded in Tasmania, New Zealand, Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. Mainly inhibit open forest, woodland, heath, roadside and farm tree belts. Mostly occur in arid and semi arid zones.

Taxonomy This species, also formerly known as the desert chat, is endemic to Australia and the only species within the genus Ashbyia.Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. This genus was named after the South Australian ornithologist Edwin Ashby.[3] The specific epithet lovensis honours the Irish missionary Reverend James Love (1889-1947). The gibberbird, along with the four chats of the genus Epithianura, have sometimes been placed in a separate family, Epthianuridae (the Australian chats), but are now thought to be aberrant honeyeaters in the family Meliphagidae.Slater, Peter (1974) A Field Guide to Australian Birds: Passerines. Adelaide: Rigby. Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1). Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1. http://www.worldbirdnames.org/ The common name of gibberbird was given as a reflection of the gibber plains that make up the primary habitat for the species and unlike other chat species, the gibberbird is almost completely terrestrial, at ease on the ground level where it feeds, roosts and nests. Description The gibberbird has a distinctive visage which is characterized by a grey crown, yellow forehead, face and underbelly with a black to grey- brown rump. The bill is a dark brown to black with grey-brown feet. The iris of the eye is a distinguishing shade of bright yellow. Unlike other chats, the gibberbird only has slight sexual dimorphisms between the male and female. Females differ very slightly and can sometimes be distinguished by more brown plumage, especially around the throat, face and neck. They can also have a heavier breast band and a generally duller appearance in comparison to the males. Juveniles appear similar to adults, with a brown back, crown and wings, and a pale yellow throat. The gibberbird is monomorphic in terms of length and weight. Generic measurements have been found to range from in length and in weight. Distribution and habitat The gibberbird is endemic to Australia and is known to inhabit the sparsely vegetated, stony regions of gibber desert. This habitat can include very open shrubland or grasslands. The extent of distribution for the gibberbird has been denoted as the southeastern Northern Territory, south-west Queensland to north-west New South Wales and across the northeastern region of South Australia. This species is more common on the sparsely vegetated, stony plains of the Lake Eyre basin and adjoining regions. It is primarily a sedentary species with no records of migration patterns; however, there have been some local movements outside of breeding season, presumably for resource attainment, especially in times of drought or flood. Gibberbirds are observed in sparsely vegetated stony deserts with a scattering of grasses such as Astrebla and Enneapogon. It is also found in low chenopod shrubland, which is mainly dominated by plant species such as Sclerolaena and Atriplex on higher ground.Wyndham, E. 1978. Emu 78: 179-87Terrill, S.E., & C.E. Rix. 1950. S. Aust. Orn. 19: 53-100Parker, S.A. 1980. S. Aust. Parks & Conserv. 3(1): 11-18Howell, J. 1991. West. Aust. Bird Notes 59: 1 In the stony deserts of northern South Australia, gibberbirds can often be encountered in low, open shrubland or grassland of Atriplex vesicaria, Frankenia Serpyllifolia and Astrebla pectinata.Brandle, R., & J.R.W. Reid. 1998. Pp 183-234 In: Brandle 1998. Behaviour Diet The gibberbird primarily feeds upon a range of invertebrates including spiders, caterpillars, moths, cicadas, grasshoppers, and other insects. Gibberbirds are indiscriminate, opportunistic foragers and have been known to feed on blowfly larvae dropped from fly-blown sheep. These are obtained by turning over clay clods with their bill to expose the sheltering maggots. Smaller larvae are consumed whole while larger larvae are bashed on the ground several times before swallowing. The majority of foraging occurs while walking on the ground but they will occasionally take to the air, up to 1 meter above ground level, while chasing flying insects. The gibberbird has also been observed running swiftly over short distances while chasing low-flying insects. Breeding The gibberbird has no set breeding period with nesting behaviour being observed year round, with particularly high incidences occurring after the first rains of the season. The nest of the gibberbird is usually situated in a depression on bare ground or beside a clump of saltbush or grass. Usually the gibberbird will nest with other pairs, often within 90m of one another. If a nest is robbed, all pairs without eggs or without young will desert and seek out a new nesting site, regardless of the stage of their nest. Those with eggs or young will remain at the nest site. The nest of the gibberbird is in a shallow depression, probably scratched out by the bird, and which may be sheltered by a bush or clump of grass. The hollow is lined with twigs and grass to form a cup-shaped nest with a surrounding platform above ground level constructed of similar material. Common nest materials also include bark and rootlets. The nests of gibberbirds have also been observed to contain flower portions and anomalies such as horse hair or wool. The average clutch size is between 2 and 4 eggs, measuring . Eggs are a pale pink to light flesh colour with reddish spots clustered around the larger end of the egg. The gibberbird chicks are altricial, blind and naked upon hatching. Voice There is little information on the call of the gibberbird and further studies will need to be conducted to fill the gaps in our knowledge of this species . However, from current studies it is known that the gibberbird has a sweet song that is thought to be utilised to call to a mate. This song has been described as \\"musical chatter\\" and to hear it is a squeaky \\"weet-weet-weet\\". The alarm call of the gibberbird is a series of 5 or 6 high piercing notes, which triggers nearby gibberbirds to seek shelter. The display call of the gibberbird is a sharp \\"whit-whit-whit\\" or a clear \\"tswee-tswee-tswee\\" performed during the ascending part of the display flight. Conservation status The gibberbird is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is possible that the gibberbird is one of the few species that has actually benefited from the introduction of stock, both through the modifications of its habitat and the increased availability of insect larvae during the winter season.Schrader, N.W. 1976.

Taxonomy and systematics The rusty-vented canastero was originally described in the genus Bathmidura (a synonym for Pachyramphus). There are two subspecies of the rusty-vented canastero recognized: consobrina of southwestern Bolivia, and dorbignyi of central Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. Many authorities still consider the dark-winged canastero as a subspecies of the rusty-vented canastero. Also, it is possible that rusty-vented canastero is not a member of the genus Asthenes at all, but instead belongs to the genus Phacellodomus.J. V. Remsen, 2003, Family Furnariidae (Ovenbirds), pages 162-357 in Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 8 (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, and D. A. Christie, editors). Lynx Edicions, Barcelona Description The rusty-vented canastero is brown or rufous brown above, usually with a rufous rump, and with pale gray or whitish underparts (throat, breast, and belly). The tail is blackish, but the outer rectrices are rufous, buffy or whitish in color. The rusty-vented canastero is common in most areas within its range,http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid;=31136&m;=0 BirdLife International but some subspecies are restricted to small geographic areas and so potentially are vulnerable to habitat loss or degradation.

Story Carmaine is a young man living in Rosaria, the capital of the kingdom of Rolandia. Rolandia's palace magician, Lady Sandra, had taken him in as a young orphan and raised him. Once he reaches his majority, Sandra allows him to leave the city, accompanied by her fairy-like homunculus servant, Tipi. Events soon transpire to lead Carmaine far beyond the gates of Rosaria... In this world, magical energy called Growshu, fills the air and people called Growsians can potentially wield magic like in ancient times. Carmaine's younger sister Louise is one such Growsian. Winged people called Featherians also exist, though they live in seclusion from humans. Long ago though, humans and featherians had to cooperate to save their world. In the course of Carmaine's journeys, he becomes an officer for the King of Rolandia. This leads to the central plot of the game, which focuses on the intrigues and conflicts between the nations of Rolandia, Burnstein, and Ranzack, the forces driving these conflicts forward, and Carmaine's connection to it all.  Reception  RPGFan gave the original Growlanser an 83 out of 100.

He signed at the age of 17 with Arsenal from Barcelona, but only appeared in 16 official games over the course of three seasons with the club. Subsequently, he returned to his country with Atl√©tico Madrid, where he also featured sparingly before leaving in 2012 (but winning the 2010 UEFA Super Cup). Club career Barcelona Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, M√©rida joined the youth ranks of FC Barcelona at the age of eight, but left the club in September 2005, being reportedly hidden away by his agent, Joseba D√≠az, which led to speculation that he would leave with no compensation for the team; his parents had become uneasy about all the young players joining Barcelona and felt that he would have a better chance elsewhere; therefore, they approached D√≠az, also Cesc F√†bregas' agent, and he promptly alerted Real Madrid, A.C. Milan and Arsenal, with the player eventually signing for the latter. On 9 October 2007, M√©rida was ordered by the courts to pay a fee around ‚Ç¨3.2 million to Barcelona as compensation for his \\"failing to meet the terms of a personal pre-contract\\" with the club. The decision was said to have serious implications for clubs in England, where players were allowed to sign professional contracts at 17, one year earlier than in Spain; in response, a Madrid-based lawyer, Rodrigo Garc√≠a, was quoted as saying: \\"English teams will now think again before signing a young Spanish player ... It's an important ruling.\\" Arsenal M√©rida scored in his first-team debut for Arsenal in a friendly against Boreham Wood in August 2006. He signed professional terms with the Gunners after his 17th birthday. M√©rida's competitive debut came on 25 September 2007 when he came on as an added-time substitute for Eduardo da Silva in a 2‚Äì0 win against Newcastle United in the third round of the League Cup, and he went on to make two further appearances in the competition. On 3 April 2008, he extended his deal with the club by signing a long-term contract, being expected to play an important role in the future as manager Ars√®ne Wenger described him as \\"an absolutely amazing player\\". On 18 December 2007, I√±aki Badiola, prospective presidential candidate of Real Sociedad, claimed he agreed a loan deal for M√©rida until the end of the season in Segunda Divisi√≥n. On 9 January of the following year, five days after he won the elections, the move was confirmed. He started in seven of his 17 appearances for the Basques during his five-month spell and made six assists, but they failed to regain their La Liga status. He scored his first professional goal on 6 April 2008, the winner as his team came from behind to defeat H√©rcules CF 2‚Äì1 at Anoeta. M√©rida returned to Arsenal for the 2008‚Äì09 campaign, making his first start in a 6‚Äì0 victory over Sheffield United in the League Cup on 23 September 2008. On 2 March 2009 Wenger heaped praise on the player, claiming the reason for him making the bench for the previous few first team games was because \\"He has been doing very, very well. He looks really good in training and is getting stronger all the time.\\"; he made his Premier League debut the following day ‚Äì hours before his 19th birthday ‚Äì coming off the bench for Samir Nasri in the dying minutes of a 3‚Äì1 win at West Bromwich Albion. M√©rida participated with Arsenal in the 2009 edition of the Emirates Cup. He replaced Aaron Ramsey midway through the second half of the team's first match, against Atl√©tico Madrid, and started and created a goal for Eduardo against Rangers, a 3‚Äì0 win which certified the tournament's conquest. He was then included in the first team for the league season and handed shirt number 46 (later changing to 32), playing 20 minutes in the second match against Portsmouth. On 28 October 2009, in the season's League Cup, M√©rida contributed to a 2‚Äì1 home defeat of Liverpool, scoring from the edge of the area with the ball hitting the post on its way past goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri. After the game, Wenger confirmed how he came close to loan the player to Levante UD at the start of the campaign, changing his mind at the last minute because he had \\"too much quality\\" to let him leave. With his contract due to expire in June 2010, he said he was having talks with the club over a new deal and hoped they could come to an agreement, while Atl√©tico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo showed his interest in bringing the youngster back to Spain if something wasn't worked out between player and club. On 5 November 2009, Arsenal confirmed that M√©rida had verbally agreed a deal with the club, but it had yet to be signed. Wenger then accused Atl√©tico of tapping up the player after announcing their public interest of talking to him, saying \\"I can't say I'm annoyed by other clubs going after our players because we do it as well. But we do it legally.\\" \\"The difference is that we do not do what is not allowed by the law. We try to get the best players everywhere when it is allowed by the rules.\\" M√©rida made only eight official appearances for Arsenal during the season, including one against Bolton Wanderers on 17 January 2010 in which he scored his first Premier League goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory. Atl√©tico Madrid On 25 May 2010, Atl√©tico Madrid officially announced that M√©rida was on his way to the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium on a free transfer, after refusing Arsenal's contract offer at the end of the campaign. He scored his first official goal for his new club on 27 October in a 5‚Äì0 win against Universidad de Las Palmas CF for the Copa del Rey, repeating the feat in the second leg (1‚Äì1 draw at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium). On 16 December 2010, M√©rida scored his third goal for the Colchoneros, netting in his first touch in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Bayer 04 Leverkusen, with the defending champions of the UEFA Europa League crashing out after the group stage. He started 2011‚Äì12 on loan to S.C. Braga in Portugal. In late December 2011, however, after just eight official appearances (five in the Primeira Liga, 132 minutes overall), he was recalled by Atl√©tico. H√©rcules On 8 August 2012, M√©rida returned to the Spanish second division by signing a four-year deal at H√©rcules. His only goal during the second tier season came from the penalty spot, against Real Madrid Castilla in a 2‚Äì4 home loss on 8 October, and he also received a straight red card in a 1‚Äì2 defeat at Real Murcia on 6 January 2013 for protesting the awarding of a spot-kick. Atl√©tico Paranaense In February 2013, after rescinding his contract for a fee of ‚Ç¨100,000, M√©rida signed for one year with Brazilian side Clube Atl√©tico Paranaense. An unused substitute for the first half of the S√©rie A season, he made his debut on 19 September away to Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, scoring his team's first goal as they came from behind to triumph 4‚Äì2; he was the first Spaniard to score in Brazil since Jos√© Ufarte for Flamengo in 1964. A week later, in the year's Copa do Brasil, he was sent off for two bookings as a late substitute against Sport Club Internacional in the first game of the quarter-finals, being unused in both legs of the final, a 1‚Äì3 aggregate loss to Flamengo. M√©rida competed with the Furac√£o in the following year's Copa Libertadores, scoring in their penalty shootout victory over Sporting Cristal in the first stage. On 26 March 2014, in the group phase, he was ejected in a 1‚Äì3 home loss to Club Atl√©tico V√©lez Sarsfield. He left in July, as his contract was not extended. Huesca M√©rida was without a club until 30 January 2015, when he signed a deal at SD Huesca until the end of the campaign in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. He played 15 games as they won Group B and promoted, scoring in a 2‚Äì0 win over Rayo Vallecano B at the Estadio El Alcoraz on 29 March. On 3 December 2015, M√©rida scored a penalty as his team beat top-flight club Villarreal CF 3‚Äì2 at home in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey, but in an eventual 3‚Äì4 aggregate defeat. A month later, he scored and was sent off in a 3‚Äì3 draw at neighbours Real Zaragoza. Osasuna On 21 July 2016, M√©rida returned to the Spanish top level after agreeing to a deal with CA Osasuna. He made his debut for the club on 20 August, replacing fellow debutant Fausto Tienza and scoring the equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against M√°laga CF. M√©rida contributed with one goal in 31 matches in 2018‚Äì19, as his team returned to the top division as champions. Espanyol On 19 August 2020, free agent M√©rida moved to RCD Espanyol on a two-year contract with the option of a third. International career M√©rida was part of the Spanish under-17 squad which won the 2007 UEFA European Championship. In July 2007 he also played for the team in the 2007 FIFA World Cup in South Korea, with the national team finishing second to Nigeria in a penalty shootout, with him missing the second penalty of the three taken. M√©rida was called up to the Spanish under-20 team for the 2009 World Cup held in Egypt: he starred in an 8‚Äì0 drubbing of Tahiti, scoring the fifth goal and providing an assist. In the next group game he continued his fine form and netted twice in a 2‚Äì0 win over Nigeria; after resting in the third group game against Venezuela (3‚Äì0) he played 76 minutes in the last-16 tie against Italy, which finished with a 1‚Äì3 loss. Personal life M√©rida's sister, Sara, is also a footballer and a midfielder. She played mainly for RCD Espanyol.

It is endemic to humid Andean forest in southeastern Peru, where mainly found in Cusco. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the slaty brushfinch.  Description  Brushfinches are typically medium-size sparrows, with long tails. Brushfinches are usually gray or olive in colour with a contrasting crown. Cuzco brushfinches are two-toned with a uniform dusky gray and a rufous crown. The center of the belly, as well as the other underparts, are lighter gray than the outside, which is dark gray and the rufous color extends to the nape. The crown is boarded by a black stripe extending from in front of the eyes until the gray auriculars. The tail and wings are blackish with the primaries margined slightly with a grayish external. There is a slight fulvous or tawny tint to the remiges most external parts. One important note is that the Cuzco brushfinch shows considerable variation with the intensity of gray in the underparts - some almost uniformly dark gray below and others that are pale gray with grayish-white abdomens. Males and females are extremely similar in colour, with the female being slightly smaller.  Measurements  Adults: Male: wing , tail 78 mm, tarsus , culmen Female: wing , tail 72 mm, tarsus 25 mm, culmen 15 mm  Taxonomy  The Cuzco brushfinch is a species in the genus Atlapetes - along with 30 others. This genus is in the under-class Aves, order passeriformes (songbirds) and family Emberizidae. The Cuzco brushfinch has been denoted in 1919 by Chapman as Atlapetes canigenis. In 1938 canigenis was categorized as a subspecies of slaty brushfinch. However, Canigenis is in a clade that contains other taxa of Atlapetes from southern Peru and Bolivia, such as Atlapetes melanolaemus (black-faced brush-finch), Atlapetes melanopsis (black-spectacled brush-finch) and Atlapetes forbesi (Apurimac brush-finch), and is not as closely related to schistaceus as once thought. Remsen and Graves (1995) later predicted that the populations of the slaty brushfinch are not monophyletic but rather have a closer relatedness to the parapatric populations of rufous-naped brushfinch. This species had population distributed from northwestern Venezuela to Bolivia. Many brushfinches occur in this area; for example, A. mfinucha rerborghi, A. schistaceus canigenis and A. mfinucha tnelnizolaernus, which all have a similarly rather poorly developed malar stripe. However this does not imply a close relationship, despite all looking very similar and having a similar habitat. Paynter (1978) hypothesised no close relationship between A. melanolaemus and A. canigenis.  Distribution and habitat  Distribution  The Cuzco brushfinch is native to the Americas. More specifically it is an endemic of south-central Peru where it is found in montane areas of the Andes. The known elevation range for this brushfinch is approximately above sea level. They are mostly seen in the surrounding areas of Cusco.  Habitat  There is very little information on the specific habitat of the Cuzco brushfinch. They do tend to reside in the humid temperate zone of the Andes, as they thrive in humid montane forest on the slopes.  Behavior   Vocalization  The Cuzco brushfinch has complex series of high-pitched squeaks. It is described as \\"shrill trill followed by a chatter and tew-tew- tew swee swee\\". Their ‚Äúdawn song‚Äù was defined as the varied phrases given at regular intervals by the male alone, mainly or only at dawn and is different than a duet call. They are also known to include loud drawn out notes.  Diet  Undocumented, but most likely it will eat a mixture of terrestrial invertebrates, seeds, and small fruits and berries. They have been seen to eat seeds from a tree. Similar species have been documented as a group to the sub- canopy type foragers.  Reproduction  Very little is documented about the nest and eggs of the Cuzco brushfinch. It is presumed that the nest is a cup. This species is seen very actively breeding at altitudes of , meaning that they probably stay in their normal habitat for this.

It is endemic to Colombia. The common name is a semi-literal translation of the scientific name, with Atlapetes referring to the brushfinch genus, and flaviceps meaning \\"yellow- headed\\". This species has a yellow to dark olive head. The throat, chin, malar streak, lores, eye-ring, and ear patch are bright yellow in any case. The rest of the plumage is yellow with dark olive upperparts, wing and tail. The variation in the head color is not well explained, but it is likely that the olive-headed individuals are females and/or immature birds.SACC [2006] Common name It is sometimes still referred to by its obsolete common name, olive-headed brushfinch. That name is the result of an interesting error. A. flaviceps occurs in a very limited range, and is rare. Until the 1980s, it was known only from the two specimens collected on October 24 and 25, 1911, in the Toch√© River valley, and two additional specimens collected in 1942. Though the exact amount and brightness was variable in the few specimens, the bright yellow head of these birds was noted. It did not receive a standardized common name due to its rarity however, being only known to a few ornithologists for which the scientific name was sufficient. That name, however, duly referenced the striking color of the type specimen, an adult male. In 1987, the first photograph of a living A. flaviceps was published. It showed a bird with very little yellow on the head, and altogether gave the impression that this species had a mainly dusky olive head. Widely distributed in a popular field guide,Dunning & Ridgely (1987) this photo led to the misleading common name, in use since the mid-20th century, becoming firmly established. When the species was rediscovered at the type locality in 1989, it was noted that some birds had the mainly dusky olive head seen in the photograph. But as far as can be told, at least the adult males have the largely bright yellow head that was referenced in the original description of this species. Thus, BirdLife International chose the common name \\"yellow-headed brushfinch\\" in 1992, and the AOU eventually followed suit. Distribution and ecology This bird was encountered in the La Plata Vieja Valley in Huila Department in 1967, but the only recent records are from the upper Coello River basin in Tolima Department (the Toch√© River is one of the main tributaries of the Coello River). Namely, it is found between 1,000 and 2,500 meters ASL in Cajamarca, Ibagu√© and Roncesvalles and perhaps Rovira municipalities, in the upper reaches of the Anaime, Cocora, Combeima and Toch√© river valleys.Losada-Prado et al. (2005) It remains locally common in thick secondary vegetation and degraded forest, bordering gallery forest and arracacha (Arracacia xanthorriza) and granadilla (Passiflora species) plantations. The yellow-headed brush finch has been observed to take part in mixed-species feeding flocks together with the common bush-tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus), white-throated tyrannulet (Mecocerculus leucophrys), golden-fronted whitestart (Myioborus ornatus), blue-and-black tanager (Tangara vassorii), blue-capped tanager (Thraupis cyanocephala) and fawn-breasted tanager (Pipraeidea melanonota). It is threatened by habitat loss; most areas in the inter-Andean valleys of Colombia have already been converted to agricultural land. The total population is believed to be at least 250 but not more than 1,000 adult birds.Losada-Prado et al. (2005), BLI (2008) Footnotes References * Dunning, John Stewart & Ridgely, Robert S.

Information about the 1886 production, including photos, a programme and a review from The Theatre, 1 January 1887, pp. 48-50 The piece was frequently revived over the next four decades. Synopsis Act I, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\", is in two scenes: \\"A Forest in Autumn\\" and \\"A Glade in Wonderland\\". Act II, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", consists of four scenes: \\"Through the Looking Glass\\"; \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\"; \\"A Sea-Shore\\"; and \\"The Banqueting Hall ‚Äì The Forest Again.\\" A review in The Theatre summarised the story as follows: :The story runs glibly, opening with a chorus of fairies surrounding Alice asleep in a chair beneath a tree, from there we progress splendidly, making a new acquaintance with all our old friends, the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, the duchess with her Baby, the Cook with her reckless use of pepper, the Cheshire Cat with his remarkable smile, the Hatter, the Hare, and the Dormouse, who have their perpetual tea party, and treat Alice to conundrums and unconventional rudeness. Then comes a long and brilliant procession, which should fill Alice's heart with awe, if not with admiration, but our heroine is nothing daunted by this large crowd. \\"Why, they're only a pack of cards,\\" she says, \\"I needn't be afraid of them?\\" and so she answers the sanguinary-minded queen of Hearts, in a reckless manner, and refuses to see heads knocked off in such profusion. She then dances with the Cards in a graceful gavotte, and afterwards protects her old friend, the Cheshire Cat, from an undeserved execution. The Gryphon and Mock Turtle then appear, and Alice receives some hints as to a sea education, and the first act of the dream play for children ends with the trial of the Knave of Hearts for eating the tarts, in which Alice's verdict of acquittal is unanimously passed. 1898 revival: Rose Hersee talking to the White Rabbit :In the second act, Mr. Savile Clarke takes us to another book, Through the Looking-Glass, and Alice is introduced to the chessmen and Chorus, who dance stiffly for her delectation, then the Red Queen gives her some advice after she has spoken to the live flowers, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear. She soon makes friends with these massive twins, and pleads hard when they determine to have a mortal combat, but all to no purpose, and so after she has witnessed the greedy Carpenter and Walrus devour their daily portion of oysters, she assists in arming Tweedledum and Tweedledee for the fray. The arrival of a Crow sends the warriors to speedy flight, and Humpty Dumpty appears on his wall, and so the play goes on until we see Alice once more asleep in her chair, and hear her wake to say, \\"Oh! I've had such a curious dream!\\" Subsequent productions Maidie Andrews as Alice in Alice Through the Looking-Glass ‚Äì The Tatler (January 1904) The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere.

He is best known for his thirteen-year tenure as the lead guitarist of the rock band Collective Soul. He is also a solo artist, and tours with his backing band, Joel Kosche Band. His debut solo album, Fight Years, was released in 2010. Life and career Kosche self-taught himself to play guitar at age 13, and later trained in classical guitar. Active in Atlanta's music scene, he co- founded the band Rhapsody, and in 1994, along with other members of Rhapsody, he co-founded the progressive rock band Jovian Storm which achieved local success with the album Magic Show. During this time, Joel showed his progressive rock influences by specially in authoring and co-authoring several epic pieces in the tradition of his favorite bands such as Queen, Kansas and Yes. After the dissolution of Jovian Storm, Kosche fronted the band Steep in which he sang lead vocals and embraced a leaner \\"American rock\\" style. Kosche eventually landed a gig as the guitar tech for the rock band Collective Soul. Ross Childress, Collective Soul's original lead guitarist, left the band in 2001, with Kosche taking his place. Collective Soul performed their first concert with Kosche in Brisbane, Australia on September 5, less than two weeks before the release of the greatest hits compilation 7even Year Itch. Kosche continued to tour with Collective Soul and later became an official member of the band. Kosche's debut studio album with Collective Soul, Youth, was released in 2004. In 2006, Kosche announced that he would be leaving Steep to focus on Collective Soul exclusively. In 2007, Collective Soul released the album Afterwords. Kosche co-wrote the album's lead single \\"Hollywood\\" with Ed Roland. Kosche also wrote and provided lead vocals on the track \\"I Don't Need Anymore Friends.\\" It was the second of two commercially released songs by Collective Soul that do not feature vocals from lead singer Ed Roland; the first one is \\"Dandy Life\\" from the album Dosage (1999), which was written and sung by original lead guitarist Ross Childress. In August 2009, Collective Soul released the album Collective Soul, also known as Rabbit to differentiate it from the band's 1995 album of the same name. Kosche co-wrote the tracks \\"You\\" and \\"Understanding\\" with Ed Roland, Dean Roland and Will Turpin. In September 2009, Collective Soul were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. At an outdoor concert in Rochester, Minnesota on August 21, 2011, it was announced that Kosche's wife had a baby daughter recently. In August 2013, Kosche collaborated with online education site JamPlay.com to put together guitar a series of lessons for aspiring guitarists and members of JamPlay. Collective Soul kicked off their 2014 North American winter tour without Kosche; Jesse Triplett took his place as lead guitarist. On February 6, Collective Soul publicly confirmed Kosche's departure from the band: \\"After 13 great years, Joel Kosche has moved on in the world of music. Collective Soul welcomes Jesse Triplett as our new lead guitarist.\\" On May 27, Kosche broke his silence regarding his departure from the band in a post written on Facebook, saying it was not an amicable split and that it had nothing to do with him wanting to pursue a solo career or wanting to \\"move on in the world of music.\\" Discography Studio albums {  - !

Foundation A well-attended public meeting was held on 31 August 1858 at Green's Exchange, 65 King William Street, Adelaide, presided by the Governor, Sir Richard MacDonnell formally to found the Association. Bishop Short proposed, seconded by the businesslike (Methodist) Rev. W.

Work The Association's first project was to investigate the condition of the Aboriginal people of the Lower Murray areas, brought to a pitiable state by the appropriation of their land by European settlers. It was resolved to establish a school and training facilities in the area; George Taplin was selected as their agent to recommend a suitable location for such a mission; he chose Point McLeay, and dedicated the next twenty years of his life to making it a reality. When in 1903 it was discovered that the city coroner, William Ramsay Smith, had removed the remains of Poltpalingada Booboorowie (Tommy Walker) before his burial in 1901, sent his body to the University of Edinburgh as an \\"anthropological specimen\\", the Association wrote to the government on behalf of the residents of Point McLeay Mission (Raukkan) asking to arrange for his remains to be returned, but their request was not taken seriously. Archives The South Australian Museum holds extensive records relating to the Aborigines‚Äô Friends‚Äô Association. The AFA collection comprises over 800 photographic images, several annual reports, magazine clippings and related papers. The collection includes records relating to Pastor Doug Nicholls, Rev. J. H.

She first appeared in Superboy (vol. 1) #217 (June 1976). Fictional character biography Original timeline In the pre-Crisis continuity, Laurel was a candidate for membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes. As a distant descendant of Superman, she had only the power of invulnerability. For most of her history Laurel Kent was a member of the Legion Academy training program, located at Montauk Point, where she was taught by Bouncing Boy with his wife Duo Damsel. It is here that she became friends with other Legion hopefuls, including Dawnstar (her roommate for a length of time), Jedediah Rikane, Shadow Lass' cousin Shadow Kid, and later Comet Queen. Post-Crisis In Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 3) #42-#43 (Jan‚ÄìFeb 1988), Laurel's original background was revealed as a fake. Instead of being a descendant of Superman, she was actually a Manhunter android from the 20th century, who had survived for a thousand years. Her powers in this era were shown to also include flight and heat-vision. When her Manhunter programming was accidentally activated, she flew off to the Manhunter base in the Himalayas and self-destructed. Post Zero-Hour After Zero Hour, the Legion of Super-Heroes were rebooted and Laurel Kent was no longer an acquaintance of the group ‚Äì and, in fact, it may well be that she no longer exists at all. A new character, Laurel Gand, was introduced partially to fill her role as a descendant of the 20th century inspiration of the Legion (in that new timeline, it was Valor instead of Superboy). Post-Infinite Crisis Some fans have speculated that in Superman/Batman # 80 (March 2011), Laurel is revealed to be a member of the Superman Dynasty in the 31st century, where she operates as Superwoman, with associates including Brane Taylor and Kent Shakespeare ‚Äì the Batman and Superman of that era ‚Äì and Tom Wayne, the Robin from the Robin 3000 series. This speculation also assumes that she is once again going by the name \\"Elna\\", which they postulate it could be to distance herself from the Manhunter who (according to this fan theory) impersonated her. However, there is no published evidence to suggest that the two characters (Laurel and Elna Kent) are the same, nor is there any evidence to support the idea that there is or was, a 'real' Laurel who was impersonated by a Manhunter android.

Early life The son of a fisherman, Jujiro Matsuda was born in Hiroshima. He was apprenticed to a blacksmith in Osaka at the age of fourteen and invented the \\"Matsuda-type pump\\" in 1906. Later, he took over management of the foundry at which he apprenticed and changed the name of the organization to \\"Matsuda Pump Partnership\\". He was forced out of his company, but started an armament manufacturer soon after ‚Äì the eponymously named Matsuda Works. Matsuda would see his fledgling company's fortunes improve when it was commissioned as a supplier to the Tsar of Russia as well as manufacturing the Type 99 rifle for the Japanese military. Toyo Kogyo and Mazda By 1921, Jujiro Matsuda was a wealthy man thanks to his previous business ventures. He moved back to Hiroshima when he was asked to take over management of floundering artificial cork manufacturer , which was placed into receivership by its creditors when the market for artificial cork dried up following the end of World War I. The unprofitable cork business ceased, and Matsuda focused on tool manufacturing. 1931 oversaw the introduction of the \\"Mazdago\\" motorized tricycle, manufactured in what is now Fuch≈´ city and the company, now known as , would set its focus on motor vehicle manufacturing. The Toyo Kogyo headquarters saw heavy damage on August 6, 1945 upon the bombing of Hiroshima. The Fuch≈´ city plant, located over 5 kilometers from the epicenter of the nuclear explosion was left relatively unscathed, and Matsuda offered its use for the Hiroshima bureau of NHK. Matsuda was not accused of being nor was he charged as a war conspirator, and a revitalized Toyo Kogyo was the main force behind repairing the damaged economy of Hiroshima following World War II. In 1950, Toyo Kogyo provided startup for a baseball team, the Hiroshima Carp. His adopted son-in-law, Tsuneji Matsuda succeeded him as president of Toyo Kogyo, and oversaw the expansion of its automobile division until 1979, when Ford Motor Company took a 25% equity stake in Toyo Kogyo. The alliance with Ford led to the divestiture of shares from the Matsuda family and the change of Toyo Kogyo into Mazda Motor Corporation in 1984.

Burgstaller was born in Holzkirchen. A trained watchmaker, he always loved to sing and his vocal talent was discovered during an amateur theatre performance in church. Alois was encouraged to sing professionally by Cosima Wagner, the widow of Richard Wagner, and he made a serious study of opera music. He took lessons in Frankfurt and at the Bayreuth School under Julius Kniese, making his stage debut in 1894 at the Bayreuth Festival in a small part. Alois would go on to sing the major Wagnerian roles of Siegfried, Siegmund, Erik, and Parsifal at Bayreuth from 1896 to 1903. He also performed these roles at other leading European opera houses, including those in such important cities as Paris, Zurich, Budapest, London, Amsterdam, and Moscow. Alois made his American debut at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, as Siegmund in \\"Die Walk√ºre\\" on February 12, 1903. He appeared throughout the United States, singing in San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles during the next six or so years. His final performance, as Siegmund, occurred on January 14, 1909. On Christmas Eve, 1903, he had sung the title role in the first staged American performance of Richard Wagner's \\"Parsifal\\" in New York City. This performance was in violation of German copyright law and angered Cosima Wagner, who was trying to keep productions of the work exclusive to Bayreuth. As a result, Alois, as well as the baritone singer Anton van Rooy and conductor Alfred Hertz, were banned from any further performances at Bayreuth. When his American career began winding down, Burgstaller appealed to the Wagner family and was eventually welcomed back to Bayreuth, performing in the festivals of 1908 and 1909. Alois spent his old age in St. Quirin, municipality Gmund, at the Tegernsee, until his death in 1945. He lies buried at the Holzkirchner cemetery and was accorded the honor of having the local market municipality and a roadway named after him.

It is endemic to the coastal heaths of south-western Australia (east of Albany). Description The noisy scrubbird features a dark brown coloured back, rust-like coloured wings and a speckled chestnut colored breast region with a grey-brown or pink bill and brown or silver legs and feet. They vary from 19‚Äì23 cm. in length and 25-58 grams. The males are distinguished from the females by exhibiting a black triangle on their throat . They are closely related to the lyrebird, having only evolutionarily distinguished from them approximately 30-35 million years ago. They prefer feeding upon small invertebrates, such as ants and beetles, in the extremely dense understory and vegetative cover that only occurs after environmental damages. Distribution The noisy scrubbird is one of Australia's rarest birds. It was presumed extinct until a population was discovered at Two Peoples Bay, east of Albany in Western Australia in the 1960s. Since then a recovery plan has been put into action. Populations of the bird have been translocated to nearby Bald Island, in Waychinicup National Park, as well as the Porongorup Ranges, where a bushfire had destroyed much of the population.  Habitat  A reason the noisy scrubbirds populations are so threatened are due to them being a very endemic species with specific living conditions and niche. They prefer subtropical to temperate rainforests >600 m in elevation with closed forests that are within 5‚Äì15 meters in height. They require dense ground cover wetlands with cover that only occurs in their small range after the recovery from a forest fire or other serious natural disaster such as flooding or logging events. In addition, they also require very dense leaf litter to feed upon the leaf degrading invertebrates in which they prefer. They typically inhabit recovering areas after they have been recovering for approximately 10 years, but there has been reported colonizations in as soon as 2 years following the damage. The scrubbird has never been recorded to inhabit an area that has not been burnt or damaged in the previous 50 years. There known range is approximately 45 cubic km combined including the Two Peoples Bay and Bald Island populations.  Reproduction  Noisy scrubbirds are sexually mature at approximately 5 years of age for males and the first breeding season for females. Unlike many other birds they lay one egg at a time and have a clutch size of only 2 eggs. The nest is a circular shape structure typically build in low lying shrubbery, rushes or sedges and is made from common sticks, leaves and decaying plant matter. Males play no part in the nest, but it is believed they may defend the territory the female has laid her eggs in. The eggs are incubated for approximately 36 days prior to hatching, and then the chicks leave the nest 4‚Äì6 weeks after hatching. In a study occurring in 2005 there is considered to be approximately 695 individual scrub birds remaining, included in that approximation is 278 territorial males. It was presumed that for each territorial male there was 2.5 females  Conservation  The noisy scrubbird is listed on the IUCN Red List as a threatened species. The species was presumed extinct when Edwin Ashby searched unsuccessfully at Ellensbrook (Margaret River) in 1920, although he noted a report by a resident of its call and movements in deep karri forest and anticipated it would be rediscovered in similar habitat. Memorial to \\"Atrichornis clamosus, a sweet voiced bird of the scrub\\" at Drakes Brook (Waroona). The populations of the noisy scrubbird are declining despite 50 years of conservation and management. Major threats include forest fires, predation by introduced species such as foxes, feral cats and black rats, degradation of habitat, soil fungi, introduced mammals, climate change and lack of genetic variation. The management conducted has focuses heavily on predation control and gaining data by surveying and radio trackers. While there has been some great successes with the reintroduction and management of the scrubbirds, lightning induced fires have damaged many of the management progress. The fungi Phytophthora cinnamomi has become more abundant in the scrubbirds range and has the ability to kill and degrade mass amounts of forest, which can heavily effect the diversity of the forest, and could easily and rapidly displace many of the remaining scrubbirds. Forest dieback due to this fungi have been shown to increase the amount of predators in the area, but have not been proven to have any effect on the scrubbirds populations yet Translocations to native ranges have been attempted several times with little success due to the noisy scrubbird requiring a very specific habitat. These translocations even required the removal of all potential predators for the scrubbird, but still had little success. The best conservation method would be to reintroduce the scrubbird to its native ranges by carefully monitoring the populations and controlling forest fires. A fire event in the few major concentrations of its populations could be detrimental to all previous conservation efforts.

It is endemic to Australia. Two subspecies are recognized: the nominate A. r. rufescens, and A. r. ferrieri.  Description  Both sexes are brown with a rufous breast and a lightly barred back. The male has a long white streak on both sides on his neck and noticeable white edging on his throat. The female has a lighter breast and lacks the white edging. Distribution and habitat The species occurs only in isolated locations in north-eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland. It requires dense ground cover and deep leaf-litter in rainforest and wet eucalypt forest, at elevations above 600 m, where it forages on snails and insects on the ground. Conservation By the mid-20th century, it was almost extinct. A subsequent recovery to Near Threatened status in 2004 was followed by successive uplisting to Vulnerable and Endangered status in 2008 and 2012 respectively, in consideration of the fragmented status and small size of remaining habitats. Total population size was estimated at a low of ~2,500 pairs in the 1980s, but is currently estimated at around 12,000 pairs. Most of the early decline is believed to have been driven by the clearance of the species' lowland habitats, and logging practices are implicated in current declines, together with natural aging (and consequent disappearance of understorey) of remaining eucalypt stands.

They are black with white thighs, a white breast, and white bars on the edges of its wings. They have a distinct, deeply forked tail. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela, in tropical lowlands. They are non- migratory. Its natural habitats are rivers and forested areas. They nest in burrows and do not use artificial cavities. It is evaluated as least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy and etymology The genus name Atticora is from Ancient Greek Atthi, \\"Athenian\\", and kora \\"maiden\\". Such terms were often applied to swallows and swifts. The specific fasciata is from Latin fascia, \\"band\\". This swallow is monotypic. Description Cristalino River, Southern Amazon, Brazil The white-banded swallow is a medium-sized swallow, measuring, on average, and weighing . They usually have a wingspan of . They decline in size from north to south, but this is a gradual decline, which suggests that there is no geographical variation. It is black, except for the band on its breast, its thighs, and bars on the edge of its wings, which are all white. It also has blackish-brown underwing coverts. Their feathers have a blue-black luster. This swallow has a deeply forked tail. The sexes are similar, although the females weigh slightly more on average ( for the males, for the females). The juveniles are noted to be duller and browner, with shorter and paler feathers. It should not be confused with the black-collared swallow, which has white underparts and throat. The call of this swallow is described as a ti-ti-tur. These swallows also have a buzzy z-z-z-z-ee-eep call, which is usually given in flight. Distribution This bird is native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It can be found to nest in tropical lowland evergreen forests near water and near both blackwater rivers and whitewater rivers, in forested areas. They are more frequently found near blackwater rivers in Columbia and Venezuela, nesting on rocky outcrops. Although they are found near water, they are rarely found over lakes. They are sometimes found over forested clearings. They usually do not occur above , although they do occur up to in Columbia. These swallows are also non-migratory. Behaviour Breeding The white-banded swallow nests in a burrow. It is thought that these swallows dig their own burrows, occasionally digging nests in riverbanks when the water is low, but they most likely also use abandoned burrows. The nest is made of dry grass. They do not use artificial nesting sites. These birds usually breed alone or in small colonies. At dusk, these birds can also be seen to roost in small groups. This swallow has a clutch of four to five white eggs, usually measuring . Diet These birds are insectivores and feed in the air. When foraging, they fly rapidly in a zigzag path or circle above the water, skimming the water in some cases. They occasionally perch on boulders or small outcroppings above the water. They forage low over the water and occasionally near forests, clearings, or grassy areas with bushes. These birds usually forage alone or in small groups, occasionally with the black-collared swallow and the white- winged swallow. Although this is true, they usually stay closer to rocks. Status Although their population is declining, this swallow is classified as a leas-concern species by the IUCN. This is because of its large range, population, and the fact that the population is not decreasing fast enough to be classified as vulnerable. Their range is estimated to be . The reason for the decline in population of this species is the fact that they are estimated to lose 12.8‚Äî13.8% of suitable habitat over 12 years, or 3 generations.

It was loosely inspired by The Muppet Show. Translated in English to \\"Small Theater World\\", the Spanish title is a portmanteau of teatro (theater) and Telemundo (at the time, WKAQ-TV's cognomen).  Overview  For several years, after the legendary T√≠o Nobel had retired, and moved to Miami, Florida, there was an empty space in children's programming at the station. David Murphy (RIP), the president of Telemundo Puerto Rico in 1987, created a fusion between Sandra Zaiter, who had been producing and hosting her own children's show, broadcast by Rikavisi√≥n, & Lou Briel and Dagmar, who were hosts at Paquito Cordero's El Show de las 12, in the musical comedy, En Broma y en Serio, broadcast then by Telemundo Puerto Rico. Zaiter moved to Telemundo and produced, starred, and wrote alongside Briel, this new concept in children's serials. The other members of the cast were Dagmar, as Dagmarita, a mischievous but sweet and sentimental girl, Leticia Rossy as Pollito Yito, a tall and inquisitive yellow chicken (loosely inspired by Big Bird), who believed he was Zaiter's son, and Francisco Torres, puppeteering Plumorosa, a flamboyant diva goose in pursuit of stardom, and Don Pepe, the administrator of the theater. Sandra Zaiter portrayed herself as Titi Sandra, the owner of the theater, that was also her home, and Lou Briel portrayed Lubrielito, an innocent kid whose puppy love was Dagmarita, although she only considered him as her pal. The show aired every Saturday and Sunday at 8:00 A.M. Zaiter and Briel sought to create a new concept that could be enjoyed by young and old alike. The series skyrocketed to the 7th and 8th places in the ratings for a while. Never before, in the history of Puerto Rican television, a children's show had achieved this, competing with prime time shows. It was divided in various segments portrayed as a sit com, based on well written scripts, with an intrinsic message and the essence of a good ending. It was written selectively by Zaiter, Rossy, and Briel. The story alternated with cartoons that were called Teatrilladas. Zaiter also wrote the theme song of the series, in the rap genre. The latter was acknowledged as the first rap song ever composed in Puerto Rico for a children's show. One of the highlights was that each show featured a guest star. After the show became popular with audiences, many major celebrities were eager to perform in Teatrimundo. Lissette, Nydia Caro, Lunna, Fernando Allende, Valeria Lynch, Ednita Nazario, Wilkins, Menudo (when Ricky Martin was a member as a kid), Luis Ra√∫l, Raymond Arrieta, Willy Chirino, and Carmita Jim√©nez were some of the diverse roster of guest stars that were included in the series. The program aired locally on Telemundo, until 1991. Later, Zaiter produced a different and cultural children's show called Telec√≥micas, also broadcast by WKAQ for several years.

In his autobiography, ‚ÄúHow the World Revolution Once Accidentally Started in the Black Forest‚Äú, he describes how he transformed from a West German communist to a capitalist, ironically in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. He had a year-long training at a secret cadre school in former communist East Germany. His autobiography describes moral conflicts, typical of the many in his country of his generation who started as extreme leftists and evolved at breakneck speed into aggressive capitalists. These developments in Geiges‚Äô political and work commitments led to far-reaching changes in his personal life, including in his love and sex life. In German media his book has been seen as a biography of a lost generation that dreamed of a better future without noticing the present. The leading German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung calls it a book \\"that sometimes lets you roar with laughter and sometimes makes you sad.\\" Since the summer of 2004 Adrian Geiges has been the Beijing Correspondent of the leading German weekly news magazine Stern.

Among its distinguishing markings are the rust-orange crown, for which it is named, black crown-stripes and eye-line and otherwise gray face. Its breast is often pale yellow. The species exhibits no obvious sexual dimorphism. Vocalization It has a musical song typically delivered in a rapid phrase of rising pitch. The response by the mate, often delivered immediately following or shortly after, is a similar song of descending pitch. Distribution and habitat Most populations occur between 1500 and 3000 meters above sea level on either side of the Andes throughout northern South America. Typically found in the subtropical and temperate forests, they can usually be found inhabiting dense under growth. Diet The russet-crowned warbler forages in pairs and small mixed flocks.

It is found in Ecuador and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. Aspects of the grey-and-gold warbler's breeding biology were recently described by Miller et al. (2007), based on a sample of two nests. It was named after British zoologist and collector Louis Fraser. One nest, in the Jorupe Reserve (owned and operated by the Fundaci√≥n Jocotoco) of southwest Ecuador, contained two well-feathered nestlings when discovered by the authors. The adults were observed to feed the nestlings one after the other, in quick succession. The nest, a domed cup with a side entrance, was built into the side of a steep ravine and tucked under a liana such that the slope of the hill and the top of the nest were even. The young, when they fledged from the nest, flew successfully from the rim of the cup and out of view. The second nest was found by the authors in the Tumbes Reserved Zone, northwest Peru. When discovered, it contained four creamy white eggs with pinkish-orange and red-brown speckles concentrated at the larger ends. Like the first nest, this second was built into a steep slope and, in this case, embedded in a natural depression at the base of a Chrysophyllum tree. After the young fledged, the first nest was collected and carefully dissected into its component parts. The nest was composed of two, distinct linings placed within the body of the nest. The lower portion of the body was tightly woven and readily distinguished from the loosely interwoven dome. Materials used included: dry grass; dark, flexible fibers; pale fibers; and skeletonized leaves. References * BirdLife International 2004.

In 2003 it had 759 students, of whom 429 were boys.Ofsted report 2003 History Prior to 1982 there were two schools on the current site of Phoenix High School: Christopher Wren Boys' School and Hammersmith County Girls' School. In 1982, these two single-sex schools were merged into one co-educational comprehensive school on a single campus. This school was named Hammersmith School, with the two major wings named Wren Wing and County Wing to denote the previous school buildings. At the time of merging, the combined pupil population was 2,200. The school that rose again from the ashes ‚Äì The Independent, 3 June 1998 By the early 1990s, both the pupil population and educational standards at Hammersmith School had fallen and it was judged by OFSTED to be a failing school. A relaunching and rebranding of the school to The Hammersmith School failed to improve standards, and in 1992 a major fire started by pupils in Wren Wing building caused extensive damage. In 1994 the school had been placed in special measures and was listed as one of the eiht most challenging schools in England and the school population had fallen to 500 pupils. 'Superhead' William Atkinson was appointed as headteacher to attempt to turn around the school's fortunes, and it was relaunched as Phoenix High School. In 2007 it was reported by The Guardian to be the \\"most improved school\\" in the United Kingdom, judged by \\"league tables\\" of results. High flyers ‚Äì Education Guardian, 11 January 2007 Headmaster Atkinson was knighted in the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honours for \\"services to education and community relations\\". Following Sir William's departure, the school once again declined into special measures, in May 2016. Following this, Michael Taylor took over the leadership of the school and it became an academy in September 2016.

It was opened in 2005 and considered to be one of Mexico's premier racing facilities. It features a road course and a oval. The track held three World Touring Car Championship events in 2005, 2006 and 2008. The FIA WTCC Race of Mexico was a round of the World Touring Car Championship, held at the Aut√≥dromo Miguel E. Abed near the city of Puebla in Mexico. The race was first run in the 2005 season, the first season of the revived series. This year, the race was almost cancelled because circuit was not ready to hold a competition. It was run every year between 2005 and 2009 except in the 2007 season, when the planned event was cancelled due to problems with the Puebla circuit, although these problems were addressed for 2008. The event was run in June in 2005, in July in 2006, in April in 2008 and in March in 2009. The 2010 running was cancelled due to security and budget fears in the region. The annual 24 Hours of Mexico race is held at the track since 2006. The circuit facilities are the most important of the country. It opens to every kind of events including: Test Driving, Driving Experiences, Track Days, 0 to 60 series, Helicopter Experience, Corporate Events, Driving School and Go-Kart circuit. Layouts The track has 18 possible layouts, and several has been used for different events. WTCC used one configuration in 2005 and 2006, and other in 2007 and 2008. ThenNASCAR Corona Series, currently NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series has used the oval in 12 races and other configuration one time. LATAM Challenge Series has used several layouts for this circuit. The oval track Oval Layout This is a counter-clockwise paperclip oval with two long straights of 650 m (0.4 mi), and curves with a radius of 118 m. The main event in this track is the Puebla 240, a race of the NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series. For the 2018 season, Puebla is on the discussion for a possible IndyCar Series race.China, Mexico among four possible new IndyCar races The touring car circuit WTCC Layout Aut√≥dromo Internacional Miguel E. Abed is based on an American style oval with long banked turns and then a twisty, technical infield which is similar to Aut√≥dromo Internacional de Curitiba with an extremely rough surface. It has no camber worth noticing on the infield part and elevation change. There is a compromise to the setup of the touring car on the touring car circuit whether it goes fast on the infield (requires more downforce) or goes fast on the oval part (requires more speed). Touring car winning on this circuit requires smart driving as much as sheer speed, tyre wear control (because of the rough surface) and strategy. Fatalities On June 14, 2009 during the 97th lap of a 100-lap NASCAR Mexico Series race at Aut√≥dromo Miguel E. Abed in Amozoc, Puebla, Carlos Pardo (September 16, 1975 ‚Äì June 14, 2009) was hit by Jorge Goeters, which caused him to lose control of his car and he crashed sideways into the end of a lower retaining wall at over 200 km/h. The car was virtually destroyed on impact. He was transported to a local hospital by helicopter, where he was pronounced dead. He was declared the winner of the race since he was leading the race at the last completed lap before the accident occurred, beating Goeters by 0.044 seconds. Pardo, driving for Motorcraft team, had started the race from the last row. He is survived by wife Ana, and an infant child. References External links *Autodromo Miguel E.

History In September 1836, Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell and his party reached the Talbot district and passed in the vicinity of Mount Greenock. Upon his return to Sydney he gave impressive reports as to the suitability of the land for sheep grazing. The settlement commenced when Alexander McCallum arrived in the area in June 1841. A grazing lease for Dunach Forest, an area of 63,640 acres (257.5 km¬≤) was granted to him on 1 April 1848. Donald Cameron had already established himself at Clunes in 1839. For the next decade the area was not greatly changed by the efforts of the settlers who lived and raised their flocks in the solitude of the bush. This peaceful scene was soon to change as the news of gold find spread throughout the colonies and to Europe and America. Gold and the development of Talbot With the discovery of gold, the pleasant pastoral scene changed as the gold seekers from various parts of the world invaded the country-side looking for the precious metal. The first unofficial record of a discovery of gold in the area was at Daisy Hill on Hall and McNeill‚Äôs ‚ÄòGlen Mona Run‚Äô. The discovery was made by a shepherd, Thomas Chapman. This discovery was not reported for fear of prosecution for gold digging. Official gold finds in Victoria date from 1851, but there is evidence of many unofficial finds like the one at Glen Mona. The first official discovery in the area around Talbot was made by two South Australians and their families at Daisy Hill Creek (later Amherst) in 1852. One of the men was Cowley, the other was John Potter. Potter claimed they unearthed a nugget while trying to free a bogged wagon. The rush to Daisy Hill followed his discovery. Amherst was first called by that name in official letters in May 1853. The population in those early years drifted up and down according to the reports from other areas. The miners started to test the ground around Back Creek and soon discoveries were made. During 1854 the only mining at Back Creek was on the creek about 2 and half miles from Amherst. Later in 1854 there was a big rush to Amherst and Back Creek. The rich ground of Ballarat Hill, Nuggetty Gully and Kangaroo Flat (Carallulup) were opened up. At the beginning of 1855 there were about 2500 diggers and store owners at Back Creek as well as 300 women and children. There was a certain amount of crime on the gold fields. Horse stealing, burglaries and violence were common. Goodwoman‚Äôs Hill rush began in March 1855 behind Dale Goodwoman‚Äôs Hotel. This influential rush at Back Creek saw nuggets of 60 oz, 40 oz and 38 oz (1.86, 1.25 and 1.18 kg) unearthed. This led to discoveries at Bakery Hill and Church Hill. In May 1855 the Chinese arrived and setup camps in Long Gully and Nuggetty Gully. New rushes took place at Daisy Hill Flat (Three Mile), Mount Greenock, Mia Mia and White Hills. Enormous finds were made during this period. Nuggets 160 oz to 267 oz (5.0 to 8.3 kg) were found and holes yielding 250 ounces (7.8 kg) and a pound (370 g) of gold load have been recorded. From 1855 until 1859 the population varied according to the finds in the locality. A water scheme built by Stewart and Farnsworth on Stoney Creek provided water for sluicing at Back Creek. This is now the Talbot Water supply storage. The next major development in the history of the area was the Scandinavian Rush in 1859. It was this rush that established the present township of Talbot. In July 1858 two deep leads joined up. One started in Nuggetty Gully while the other commenced on Ballarat Hill. Claims were taken up on Goodwoman‚Äôs Hill and now the leads moved north. The Scandinavian Rush was the continuation of workings at Goodwoman‚Äôs Hill. The prospectors of this rush were Carl Hallem, Adolph and Carl Olsen and Joseph Bell. The Scandinavian Rush began in earnest in the early part of 1859 and the diggers found the areas \\"alive with gold\\". Windlasses were going in all directions, tents erected in every available spot. The riches dug up were enormous. At this time, the main street was being formed at the Crescent. By March 1859 there was an estimate of 15,000 people at the rush. The main street was called Scandinavian Crescent in March and hundreds of places of business were opened to cater for the needs of the diggers. Camp Street became the new road to Amherst. Reports of large nuggets and great yields kept the miners in the area. The ‚ÄòAmherst and Back Creek Advertiser‚Äô was started in March followed by the ‚ÄòNorth-West Chronicle‚Äô. Permanent buildings replaced temporary tents in Camp Street. A post office, several banks (such as the National, Bank of Australasia, London Bank of Australia, The Victoria) and a church were started. During that fabulous month of March, there were six streets of stores. Oxford Street was a narrow row of stores. Other streets established were Bond Street, Russell Street, Ballarat Street and Chapman Street. The latter was then called Sturt Street. The area must have presented a bewildering scene to the casual observer. A theatre opened in Oxford Street towards the end of the month. At Robinson & Co. store a post office opened with a Mr. Andrews as the postmaster. Goodman's Phoenix Hotel built after Goodman's original Hotel was destroyed by fire. The Phoenix still stands in Scandinavean Crescent today. To break through the basalt cap over the gold saw the introduction of blasting. Some unlucky miners met their deaths in blasting accidents at this time. Such mishaps could not deter the miners from the wealth that was found from this field. This must have been one of the, if not the most, exciting births of any town in the country. Noise and confusion from large numbers of excited diggers, the clang of anvils, the rattle of windlasses and the explosions from blasting. The sights recorded by visiting correspondents‚Äîa cake of gold (200 ounces or 6 kg) in a gold broker‚Äôs window in the crescent and in another, 1,500 ounces (47 kg) of nuggets‚Äîseem like fairy tales. Such was the wealth of this area. In November 1858 the first sitting of a newly proclaimed Amherst Borough Council took place. This council was formed to administer the district including the Back Creek area. From the period we can obtain information via the Municipal Rate records. Crown survey of allotments took place in 1861-62. From these sources a view of the number and type of business ventures can be ascertained. For example, the Crescent could boast 23 restaurants, a variety of hotels and ale stores, tobacconists, 4 butchers, 5 boot shops or boot makers, 3 tent shops, 6 drapers, a number of druggists or chemist shops, milliners, saddlers, confectioners and billiard saloons. This list is just a cross section to show the variety of goods and services available to diggers. The Talbot Farmers Market attracts in excess of one thousand people every month. The Scandinavian Rush subsided in 1860. It had created a town and provided a population. At this time the \\"Frontage System\\" regulations came into force. This was an arrangement where parties were guaranteed priority of place on a lead according to the date of their registration. During this period there were possible one hundred companies working in the area. Some of these companies were the Great Extended Conway Castle, Independent, Talbot Paddock Co., Prince Alfred and Morton Extended. In 1862 the Sadowa Co. sank a shaft in the paddock owned by W.G. McCulloch. It got about 60,000 ounces of gold before it lost the lead. This lead has not been found. Companies on the Mount Greenock lead were the Union Co. (owned by Carl Schultz and Alolph Von Pein), the Hoffnung Co. (owned by Klein and Christensen), The Rip Van Winkle, Nichols Freehold Co., The Robert Nicholl and the Greenock Estate. Talbot had made rapid strides in its development. In 1864 it had a Court House, borough offices, seven schools, a street of good shops, two breweries, churches, two soap and candle factories, sixteen hotels, coach services and general carriers, and a number of crushers. It also had a population of about 3,400 (the accuracy of this figure could vary because of the transient nature of the miners). There were also cultivation blocks and dairy farms and a common pasturage which operated with the aid of a pound keeper. Talbot was officially named on 19 October 1861 by the then Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The area continued to develop during the sixties and on 31 October 1865 the Shire of Talbot was proclaimed. The Post Office had opened as Back Creek on 24 February 1854 and renamed Talbot in 1862. Many of the buildings still existing in the town were built during the 1860s and 1870s. During the late 1880s the mines began to close and the population slowly started to drift away. The return of soldiers from the First World War saw an acceleration of this drift. With no established industries left, the town today is only a shadow of the town born during those early days of 1860. However, Talbot still has an interesting story to tell to any visitors. A resurgence of people and business attracted to the landscape and the town's rich history and architecture have seen the redevelopment of the town once again. The Town today A popular Farmers Market sees thousands of people descend on the town the third Sunday of every month. The increase in tourism in areas such as Daylesford and Avoca is encouraging new businesses with several new restaurants and shops opening recently. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Maryborough Castlemaine District Football League. Golfers play at the course of the Talbot Golf Club on Lexton Road.

It is an annual race, taking place every February. The race was first held in 1991 for Series Production cars and moved to Sydney's Eastern Creek Raceway in 1995 before being discontinued. The race was revived in 2007, again for production cars, before adding a new class for GT3 and other GT cars in 2011. This has led to unprecedented domestic and international exposure for the event. In all, eighteen races have taken place; seventeen at Mount Panorama and one at Eastern Creek Raceway. Background The event was inspired by the long- running Bathurst 500 production car race, which began at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit in Victoria in 1960 (before moving to Bathurst in 1963) as a race for standard production cars with minimal modifications. In 1973 when the race was lengthened from 500 miles to 1000 kilometres, the regulations for cars entering the race changed from standard \\"series production\\" cars to improved touring cars. The Bathurst 12 Hour was intended to re-create the original feel of the Bathurst 1000, while providing a unique test in the longer race distance, rather than replicating the 1000 kilometre event. History Production origins In 1990, Vincent Tesoriero, a race promoter and former Bathurst 1000 competitor, looked at the decline of Group A touring cars in Australia and saw an opportunity to run a 12-hour endurance race for Series Production cars at Mount Panorama. Tesoriero secured long time Bathurst 1000 sponsor James Hardie as a sponsor for the event in late 1990, leaving limited time to launch and organise the event for the Easter weekend in 1991. The race regulations were based on the Group 3E Series Production Car rules then in use in the Australian Production Car Championship for naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder passenger sedans, but also allowed turbocharged and V8-engined cars which had been outlawed from the Production Car Championship in 1990. Despite the short deadline, twenty-four cars were entered for the first race, spread over six different classes based on engine capacity and sporting specification. Exotic mid-engined sports cars and GT cars were not eligible to enter. The race was originally scheduled to run from 9am to 9pm but this was disallowed by Bathurst Regional Council. The race would instead run from 5:15am to 5:15pm, with the final two hours televised by Network Ten. Despite the event's length, the competitors proved extremely reliable, with twenty cars finishing the race. The race was won by Allan Grice, Peter Fitzgerald and Nigel Arkell racing Fitzgerald's 1989 Production Car Championship specification Toyota Supra Turbo. In 1992, manufacturer- backed teams began to appear with large teams entered and funded by Mazda, Holden, Citro√´n and Peugeot. Porsche would also provide factory support from 1993 onwards. Honda, Nissan, Maserati, BMW and Lotus were also represented but not by factory-supported teams. The Mazda team would go on to dominate the event with the Mazda RX-7, winning the next three consecutive races at Mount Panorama. Facing rising costs, the 1995 event was moved from Bathurst to Eastern Creek Raceway in Sydney, and from the Easter weekend to August, before the race was discontinued in 1996. Hiatus After no major race for production cars for a number of years, the concept was revived with the short- lived Bathurst 24 Hour races in 2002 and 2003. The races were run by Nations Cup owners PROCAR and were dominated by the Holden Monaro 427Cs of Garry Rogers Motorsport. The Bathurst 24 Hour only lasted two years before PROCAR owner Ross Palmer was forced to abandon the race due to rising costs. Revival The Bathurst 12 Hour was successfully revived in 2007 as part of the Bathurst Motorsport Festival While James O'Brien, who masterminded the return of the event, planned for GT cars to share the event with production cars, the return of the race began with regulations close to its original concept as a race for production cars. 32 cars were entered for the 2007 race, which was won by Garry Holt, Paul Morris and Craig Baird in a BMW 335i. The win was ten years after Morris and Baird had won the 1997 AMP Bathurst 1000 in a BMW only to later be disqualified for exceeding driver time regulations. The race proved a preview of this period of the race, which saw BMW and Mitsubishi as the main combatants. The 2007 Subaru entry of rally drivers Chris Atkinson, Dean Herridge and Cody Crocker would be the only other manufacturer to finish the race in the top two between 2007 and 2010. The 2008 and 2009 races were won by Mitsubishi Lancers, with Rod Salmon and Damien White amongst both line- ups. The 2009 race was particularly dominated by Mitsubishi, with the marque finishing in the first four positions. Garry Holt would then repeat his 2007 victory in 2010, driving again with Morris and also with John Bowe. The race was interrupted for an hour after a tree fell across Conrod Straight. The number of entries grew over this production-based period, peaking at 48 in 2009, while the final race held strictly to production car regulations in 2010 attracted 42 entries. During this time, the event itself grew in stature each year, firmly entrenching itself as one of the biggest race meetings at the start of the domestic Australian racing season, along with the Adelaide 500 and the Australian Grand Prix. International expansion In 2011, GT3-specification cars were allowed into the 12 hour race for the first time. Despite this, the number of entries dropped dramatically as many of the production car teams, disillusioned by the move towards GT, decided not to race. Of the 26 cars that competed in 2011, just eight raced in the production car classes, compared with the 42 that made up the full 2010 field. The German-based Joest Racing dominated the 2011 event, with the team's two Audi R8 LMS GT3s finishing first and second, a lap ahead of the third-placed Porsche. 2012 saw another small field of just 25 cars. Audi won the race for the second consecutive year, this time with DTM and FIA GT1 team Phoenix Racing. The 2013 event ended the two-year run of poor entry numbers, with a record field of over 50 cars. Another first for the event saw the opening round of the 2013 Australian GT Championship incorporated into the first hour of the race. The results of the GT Championship round were based on the positions of the cars that had elected to race for GT Championship points at the end of the first hour of racing. Teams could then either continue on and complete the full race, or withdraw their car after the first hour. Drivers were allowed to cross-enter between cars so that they could race one car in the one-hour GT Championship race and then drive another car that was entered for the full 12 hours. Erebus Motorsport took the first win for an Australian team under the GT regulations with German drivers Bernd Schneider, Thomas J√§ger and Alexander Roloff taking their Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG to victory. Maranello Motorsport took a poignant win in the 2014 event‚Äîthe team's former driver Allan Simonsen was killed in a crash at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans‚Äîwith V8 Supercar driver Craig Lowndes holding off a late charge from German driver Maximilian Buhk to take victory. 2014 also saw the introduction of the Allan Simonsen Pole Position Trophy, named in honour of Simonsen, to be awarded to the fastest car in qualifying. The 2015 race featured a record twenty safety car periods, the last coming just minutes from the end of the race. Katsumasa Chiyo, driving a Nissan GT-R, took the lead with two laps remaining to give Nissan its first major victory at Mount Panorama since the 1992 Bathurst 1000. In August 2015, the V8 Supercars-owned company Supercars Events purchased 50% of the Bathurst 12 Hour, joining existing part-owners Bathurst Regional Council. This followed a date clash between the 2015 12 Hour and V8 Supercars' 2015 pre-season test day which saw V8 Supercar drivers, such as 2014 12 Hour-winner Lowndes, forced to take part in the test day and be unable to race in the 12 Hour. With an increasing focus on the outright GT3 cars and a dwindling number of production cars in the race, the former organisers of the 12 Hour, Yeehah Events, announced the production car-based Bathurst 6 Hour for 2016, to restore a Bathurst endurance race for the production category. The 6 Hour is now part of the Bathurst Motor Festival at Easter. Intercontinental GT Challenge The 2016 race was the inaugural race of the newly formed Intercontinental GT Challenge, which in its first year also included the Sepang 12 Hours and Spa 24 Hours and is managed by the St√©phane Ratel Organisation. The event itself saw record pace from Shane van Gisbergen in qualifying and the race to lead his Tekno Autosports McLaren 650S GT3 to victory alongside McLaren factory driver √Ålvaro Parente and Tekno team owner/driver Jonathon Webb. The 2017 event saw the introduction of an all-pro GT3 class for the first time, with the race receiving 55 entries, the highest in the event's revival. In the race itself, Maranello Motorsport repeated their 2014 triumph, with Finnish driver Toni Vilander teaming up with Lowndes and Jamie Whincup to receive the Australian Tourist Trophy, which became the perpetual trophy for the outright winner. The 2018 race finished before the twelve hour duration due to a major crash at Sulman Park involving Ash Walsh, Bryce Fullwood and John Martin which saw Walsh and Martin transported to hospital. This meant that the Audi Sport Team WRT entry of Robin Frijns, Stuart Leonard and Dries Vanthoor took the flag, despite doubts over whether they had the fuel to win the race if there was no disruption. In 2019, the race had unprecedented amounts of green flag running leading to a distance record being set. After dropping from first to fourth in the final pit-stop phase, Matt Campbell completed three overtakes, including one on Chaz Mostert that required a post-race investigation, to take Porsche's first victory in the race alongside Dennis Olsen and Dirk Werner. The 2020 race again broke the distance record with Bentley taking their first victory in the event in six attempts. The field was reduced by five cars prior to the race with several heavy crashes in practice and qualifying. The 2021 event was cancelled due to international travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Bathurst 12 Hour called off for 2021 Speedcafe 19 October 2020 Winners Events which were not held at Mount Panorama Circuit are indicated by a pink background. {  style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" - !

As the debris was unable to be cleared to allow the race to restart before the deadline of 5:43 PM (race regulations state the race starts at 5:45 AM and ends with one full completed lap once the leader crosses the finish line after 5:43 PM), the race results were backdated to lap 271 meaning that two of the three cars involved in the incident were classified. - Race record for laps & distance covered.

Simonsen, who had raced several times in Australia as part of a long and varied career, held the Bathurst 12 Hour race lap record at the time, as well as driving the fastest officially timed lap around Mount Panorama in a closed-wheel car. The introduction of the trophy coincided with the relaxing of qualifying restrictions from previous years, with the removal of the minimum allowed lap time (two minutes and six seconds), therefore allowing a major improvement in qualifying times. Despite the name, the trophy is given to the fastest qualifying time, not the car that starts on pole position in the case of a grid penalty, as initially occurred in 2019. In 2014, Simonsen's former team at the 12 Hour, Maranello Motorsport, narrowly missed pole to Maro Engel by less than a tenth of a second. Maranello went on to win the race itself. In 2015, Laurens Vanthoor set the fastest ever officially recorded time of Mount Panorama in qualifying. This time was only to last twelve months, with Shane van Gisbergen beating the time by over one second in qualifying for the 2016 race. In 2017 a top ten shootout was introduced, as per the Bathurst 1000, with the fastest time winning the trophy. In 2018, Chaz Mostert became the first Australian to take the trophy as well as making BMW the fifth manufacturer to win the trophy in the five years since its inception. The 2019 battle for the trophy had several twists, with the Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3 of Jake Dennis initially taking the trophy after setting the fastest time in the Top 10 Shootout, despite a two-place grid penalty that he had earlier received for pit-lane speeding. Later, the car was excluded from the Top 10 Shootout for a technical infringement, granting the trophy to the Mercedes-AMG GT3 of Raffaele Marciello. {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! Year !

On the race's return, the race was broadcast initially as a highlights package on SBS as well as being streamed online. In 2012, the event received its first live coverage since the 1990s, with pay television network Speed airing the final 90 minutes of the race, as well as producing a three-hour highlights package. Since the 2013 event, which was not broadcast live on television, commentary has been provided by Radio Show Limited who broadcast every session live on Radio Le Mans, building an international audience for the event. In 2014, RSL provided their commentary to SBS, who broadcast the final three hours of the race live on free-to-air. From 2015 onwards, the entire race has been broadcast live on the Seven Network and 7mate, still in partnership with RSL, and has continued to be streamed online. In 2020, pay television channel Fox Sports and its streaming service Kayo Sports broadcast the event in addition to 7mate. The estimated viewing audience for the 2014 race was over half a million people from 150 countries.

He was also an excavator, dealer in antiquities and manufacturer of biscuit porcelain figurines. Biography Giovanni Volpato was born in Bassano del Grappa (then in the state of Venice). He received his first training from his mother, an embroiderer, and then studied under Giovanni Antonio Remondini. In 1762 he went to Venice and worked with Joseph Wagner and Francesco Bartolozzi, engraving several plates after Piazzetta, Mariotto, Amiconi, Zuccarelli, Marco Ricci and others. He worked for some time for the Duke of Parma, until a plate of the Monument of Francesco Algarotti in Pisa brought him wider notice. In 1771, following a suggestion of his patron Girolamo Zulian, he moved to Rome, where he founded a school of engraving and gained a reputation for his series of plates after the frescoes of the Raphael Rooms and Loggias in the Vatican (1770‚Äì77). Some of these plates were hand- colored by Francesco Panini, and did not necessarily reproduce the actual design or subjects of the Loggias' vaults and pilasters, but they became much in demand among visitors to Rome. Volpato also engraved a set of plates after Annibale Caracci's decorations in the Palazzo Farnese. He engraved a series of landscapes and vedute of Rome with Pietro Ducros. Volpato was a friend of the British painter and antiquarian, Gavin Hamilton. When Volpato himself became an excavator, he supplied Hamilton with some sculptures and engravings for his Schola Italica Picturae, while Hamilton introduced him to clients interested in his findings and publications. Volpato made excavations in Ostia (1779, with the antiquarian Thomas Jenkins), Porta San Sebastiano (1779) and Quadraro (1780); and sold sculptures to king Gustav III of Sweden (1784), to the Vatican Museums, and to the British collector, Henry Blundell. In 1788 he sold the celebrated Lante Vase to Colonel John Campbell. In 1792, in collaboration with Louis Ducros, he published a series of prints of the interiors of the new Museo Pio-Clementino.F. Haskell, 'The Museo Pio-Clementino in Rome and the Views by Ducros and Volpato', in Louis Ducros: Images of the Grand Tour [exhibition catalogue, Kenwood House, London] (1985), p.36-39. In 1785, he established a porcelain factory that made ceramic replicas of Greco-Roman originals to satisfy the demand for antique art during the Neoclassic period.H.

Grassroots Campaigns employs thousands of workers to generate small-donor contributions, increase visibility, and expand the membership base for a number of progressive groups, issues, and campaigns. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the company was founded in December 2003 by a small team of experienced organizers who specialized in grassroots- level political and public interest organizing with groups like the Public Interest Research Group However, since its founding, it has consistently faced accusations of anti-union activity at odds with its stated progressive roots.http://trail.pugetsound.edu/?p=5883  History  Grassroots Campaigns was founded in December 2003 with the goal of providing high-quality data- driven field campaigns and small donor fundraising campaigns to progressive organizations and candidates. The company expanded very rapidly. By April 2004 Grassroots Campaigns had opened offices in 40 cities throughout the country. By July 2004 they had over 2,000 staff knocking on doors and fund raising on behalf of the Democratic National Committee. During that same year Grassroots work with MoveOn PAC to help staff and manage their \\"Leave No Voter Behind,\\" campaign. This was a \\"get out the vote\\" (GOTV) program intended to give Democratic candidate John Kerry an edge in the swing states. By October 2004, they had more than 50,000 people canvassing their neighborhoods in 17 of the most contested swing states of the 2004 Presidential Election. Following the 2004 election, Grassroots kept some of their field offices open in order to run door-to-door and site-based canvassing programs to raise money from small donors and help build and expand supporter lists on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. In 2006, Grassroots Campaigns again partnered with MoveOn.org to run Call for Change, one of the largest volunteer phonebanking efforts in American history. Over 120 organizers in 40 cities nationwide recruited and trained over 100,000 volunteers who made more than 7 million phone calls to voters in the closest races of the midterm election. Following this election cycle, Grassroots continued to expand its year-round field programs, including maintaining base-building and small-donor fundraising operations in more than a dozen cities across the country. During the 2008 election cycle, Grassroots Campaigns expanded and partnered with a number of organizations working to elect Barack Obama and other Democrats. More than 200 organizers and canvass directors across the country ran programs that registered over 250,000 voters in key battleground states. As the election approached Grassroots Campaigns took part in get-out-the-vote efforts in key states. Grassroots worked with the League of Conservation Voters among other groups to contact voters in key states and districts and encourage voters to make it out to the polls. During the 2010 midterm elections, Grassroots Campaigns was active in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Missouri and Washington state. Grassroots Campaigns ran nationwide voter mobilization effort in 2012 to re-elect President Obama and help other Democratic candidates get into office. Most work was done in Colorado and Nevada, with additional projects in Montana and a few other states. In 2014 Grassroots Campaigns did extensive work in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Grassroots ran the largest canvass in the state for the Iowa Senate race, knocking on more than 150,000 doors statewide. Following the election, Grassroots is launching permanent offices in Des Moines and Phoenix. While it continues to open offices throughout the country, it is also hampered as they also tend to close offices that engage in union activity.https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-137094  Current work  Grassroots Campaigns is currently running national campaigns for progressive political and charitable organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Oxfam America, The Nature Conservancy and The Southern Poverty Law Center. Grassroots Campaigns entered the fall of 2012 running offices in 18 cities. Grassroots Campaigns currently employs over 100 Lead Directors, Assistant Directors, and Field Staff who manage staff and run these offices and an estimated 750 paid canvassers nationwide.

The Oregon claim alleged that Grassroots improperly paid some students a minimum wage less than the local allowed minimum wage for a portion of their hours worked. Grassroots Campaigns claimed the students were paid properly and legally, and the matter was settled by both parties.Willamette Week , 9/20/06Oregon Courts Online , subscription needed to access court records Grassroots Campaigns has also had numerous charges of anti-union activity, with unfair labor practices filed with the National Labor Relations Board in Portland,https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-134092 Philadelphia,https://www.nlrb.gov/case/04-CA-038092 Seattle,https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-219053 Chicago,https://www.nlrb.gov/case/13-CA-044942 Ann Arbor.https://www.nlrb.gov/case/07-CA-198327 The cases include unfair retaliation, discipline, layoffs, surveillance of employees, coercion, intimidation, and illegal closure of offices in response to union activity in Portlandhttp://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/17086/canvassing_for_progressive_causes_the_worst_job_in_townhttps://libcom.org/news/united- campaign-workers-challenge-predatory-tactics-grassroots-campaigns-inc-nature- conserv and Seattle.https://psmag.com/economics/grassroots-campaigns-unjust- labor-practices  Further reading  *\\"Gross Profit: Money Given to Clipboard Kids Rarely Makes It to Nonprofits\\" SF Weekly, Sep 28 2011 *\\"Can I Ask You a Question?

He was active mostly in France and in Italy and London as well. Perr√©al's major patrons were Charles of Bourbon, King Charles VIII, Louis XII and Francis I, all of France. It is mentioned that in honor of Charles of Bourbon he painted escutcheons for the entry of the nobleman to the city of Lyon,\\"Perr√©al, Jean\\", The Grove Dictionary of Art, 2000, www.artnet.com but the date of Charles' birth, 1489, and the time of the artist's residence in Lyons do not coincide accurately. His most remarkable works are often considered to be a portrait of Charles VIII (Mus√©e Cond√©) and a miniature piece, ', an image of a poet who, like Perr√©al, was a royal valet de chambre. A letter from Perr√©al to Margaret of Austria circa 1511 survives describing the relative merits of marble and alabaster, signed 'Jehan Perreal de Paris, votre Valet de Chambre et paintre indigne.'HMC, 9th report and appendix part 2, Alfred Morrison, (1884), 412. He was an accomplished designer of tombs, medals, theater scenery and ceremonies, including the marriage of King Louis XII and his second wife Mary Tudor. For the marriage, Perr√©al was sent to London in 1514, where he also executed a portrait of Mary Tudor. Working in a glazed paint pigment on glass, he also crafted a unique portrait of Louis XII, entitled Louis XII of France in Prayer (Walters Art Museum). As a sculptural designer, Perr√©al sketched the design for the tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, which was executed by the French sculptor Michel Colombe, and is now in the cathedral of Nantes. In 1516, he painted an allegorical image, la complainte de nature √† l'alchimiste errant (The Lament of Nature to the Wandering Alchemist), in which a winged figure with arms crossed, representing Nature, sits on a tree stump with branches that have been intricately shaped, with a fire burning in its base, conversing with an alchemist in an ankle-length coat, standing outside of his stone-laid shoreline laboratory. Live resprouting shoots emerge from either side of the tree stump seat to form a fancifully twined and pleached two-story-tall chair back. His style is noted as keeping to the elegant French tradition, as well as a touch of Flemish realism.\\"Perr√©al, Jean\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007.

Butler was a professor of public health at the University of Canberra from November 2012 until July 2016. In 2018 he was appointed as an honorary professor at the National Centre for Epidemiology & Population Health at Australian National University,. He is a former senior research fellow in global health at the School of Health and Social Development at Deakin University. Butler studies the intersection of sustainability, globalization, and health. His main research interest lies in trying to find ways to advance sustainable global health. Training and education Butler obtained a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (Hons) degree in 1984 and a Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1987, both from the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. In 1985, prior to his final year of medical school, he spent ten months outside of Australia, mostly studying health issues in low-income countries. This included time in Nigeria with the health arms of two Christian missions, as well as the University of Ilorin, and in Nepal with the Britain Nepal Medical Trust. After graduating, he worked for several years in rural general practice in Tasmania. His longstanding interest in global health led him to pursue a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&H;), which he received from the Royal College of Physicians in 1990. In 1997, he obtained a Master of Science degree in epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. While there, his main mentor was Professor Tony McMichael. In 2002, Butler completed a multidisciplinary PhD at the Australian National University, entitled \\"Inequality and sustainability\\".https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/46233 His thesis argued that the unequal distribution of global political and economic influence facilitates \\"environmental brinkmanship,\\" whereby the wealthy and powerful risk global environmental change of a degree that threatens the fabric of civilization. These ideas are components of what has recently been called \\"planetary health.\\" While studying for his PhD, Butler was awarded the 2001 Borrie Prize by the Australian Population Association for \\"the best student paper on a population-related topic\\". Butler's winning essay traced the decline of Malthusian thinking within demography. Career In 1989, Butler co-founded BODHI with the late Susan Woldenberg. These organizations, one in the US and one in Australia, work in the field of international health, primary health care, and education. BODHI identifies itself as one the third or fourth oldest Buddhist influenced development NGO[s] based in the West. Butler contributed to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which was requested by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2001, both in the conceptual framework (\\"Ecosystems and Human Well-Being\\") and the scenarios working groups. In 2009, the French Environmental Health Association named Butler one of \\"a hundred doctors for the planet.\\" In 2010, Butler was awarded an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship, which \\"supports research in areas of critical national importance by giving outstanding researchers incentives to conduct their research in Australia. The aim of Future Fellowships is \\"to attract and retain the best and brightest mid-career researchers.\\" Butler's grant project, which he completed in 2015, was entitled \\"Health and Sustainability: Australia in a Global Context.\\" In 2014, Butler co-founded an international research network based at the University of Canberra called Health-Earth. The network has six major research themes: poverty, climate change, infectious disease, ecosystem disruptions, security, and transformation. Also in 2014, he also became the first Australian contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be arrested for civil disobedience,http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra- university-professor-arrested-at-coal-mine-protest-20141128-11w7lq.html in opposition to Australian government policies concerning climate change.

It is used as a topical drug for medical depigmentation. It is a colourless solid that is classified as the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone. Monobenzone is soluble in alcohol, benzene, and diethyl ether, and practically insoluble in water. Pharmacology The topical application of monobenzone in animals increases the excretion of melanin from melanocytes. The same action is thought to be responsible for the depigmenting effect of the drug in humans. Monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation. The histology of the skin after depigmentation with topical monobenzone is the same as that seen in vitiligo; the epidermis is normal except for the absence of identifiable melanocytes. Therefore, monobenzone is used as a topical medicine to permanently depigment normal skin surrounding vitiliginous lesions only in patients with disseminated (greater than 50 percent of body surface area) idiopathic vitiligo. Monobenzone is also being considered for the treatment of melanoma. Other uses Monobenzone is also used to derive dyes for fiber dyeing and is used in the rubber industry.

Spring Garden Lane is a street in Wan Chai, Hong Kong, connecting Queen's Road East to its south, and Johnston Road to the north. It was one of the first focal areas developed by the British in Hong Kong during the 1840s. History During the early development of Wan Chai, one of the focal area of development was Spring Gardens. The name was used by the British during the early Colonial Hong Kong era in the 1840s. The word \\"spring\\" in \\"Spring Gardens\\" was supposed to be referring to a water spring. However, when the name \\"Spring Garden Lane\\" was translated into Chinese, the resulting name became \\"\\", with the character \\"\\" meaning spring season. The water spring mentioned possibly refers to the mountain creek beside Hopewell Centre in Queen's Road East. In the early 1900s, Spring Garden Lane and Sam Pan Street () became a red-light district with western and eastern prostitutes. To attract attention, brothels were displaying large street number plates, and the area became known as \\"Big Number Brothels\\".\\"Early Hong Kong Brothels\\", Exhibition at the University Museum and Art Gallery, 26 November 2003 to 29 February 2004Wan Chai Heritage Trail flyer. p.2 During the founding of the People's Republic of China around 1948 to 1949, many of the Communist party guerrilla forces found their way to Hong Kong after World War II. One of them was the East River Guerrilla Force (), which formed a pro-Communist underground group called the Hailiushe (). They were headquartered in the rooftop of a multi-story house on Spring Garden Lane. The area and group was raided by the Hong Kong police, while it was an operating network cell.

They are often employed in primary water treatment in place of conventional settling tanks. They are used in Industrial water treatment. Unlike conventional clarifiers they use a series of inclined plates. These inclined plates provide a large effective settling area for a small footprint. The inlet stream is stilled upon entry into the clarifier. Solid particles begin to settle on the plates and begin to accumulate in collection hoppers at the bottom of the clarifier unit. The sludge is drawn off at the bottom of the hoppers and the clarified liquid exits the unit at the top over a weir.  Range of applications  Lamella clarifiers can be used in a range of industries including mining and metal finishing, as well as used to treat groundwater, industrial process water and backwash from sand filters. Lamella clarifiers are ideal for applications where the solids loading is variable and solids sizing is fine and are more common than conventional clarifiers at many industrial sites due to their smaller footprint. One specific application is as pre-treatment stage for effluent entering membrane filters. Lamella clarifiers are considered to be one of the best options for pre-treatment ahead of membrane filters. Their all steel design means there is a low chance that part of the inclined plate will chip off and be carried over into membrane, especially when compared to tube settlers which are constructed of plastic. Further lamella clarifiers are able to maintain the required water quality to the membrane without the use of chemicals. This is a cost saving measure both in purchasing chemicals and limiting damage to the membrane, as membranes do not work well with the large particles contained in flocculants and coagulants. Lamella clarifiers are also used in the municipal wastewater treatment processes. The most common wastewater application for lamella clarifiers is as part of the tertiary treatment stage. Lamella clarifiers can be integrated into the treatment process or stand-alone units can be used to increase the flow through existing water treatment plants. One option for integrating lamella clarifiers into existing plants is for conventional or sludge blanket clarifiers to be upgraded by attaching a bundle of inclined plates or tubes before the overflow in the so-called \\"clear water zone\\". This can increase the settling area by two-fold resulting in a decrease in the solids loading in the overflow.  Advantages and limitations  The main advantage of lamella clarifiers over other clarifying systems is the large effective settling area caused by the use of inclined plates, which improves the operating conditions of the clarifiers in a number of ways. The unit is more compact usually requiring only 65-80 % of the area of clarifiers operating without inclined plates. Therefore, where site footprint constraints are of concern a lamella clarifier system is preferred. The reduced required area allows the possibility for the clarifiers to be located and operated inside, reducing some of the common problems of algae growth, clogging due to blowing debris accumulation and odour control, that occur when the machinery is outdoors. Operation within an enclosed space also allows for a better control of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The inclined plates mean the clarifier can operate with overflow rates 2 to 4 times that of traditional clarifiers which allow a greater influent flow rate and thus a more time efficient clarification process. Lamella clarifiers also offer a simple design without requiring the use of chemicals. They are therefore able to act as pre-treatment for delicate membrane processes. Where necessary flocculants may be added to promote efficiency. Lamella clarifier performance can be improved by the addition of flocculants and coagulants. These chemicals optimize the settling process and cause a higher purity of overflow water by ensuring all smaller solids are settled into the sludge underflow. A further advantage of the lamella clarifier is its distinct absence of mechanical, moving parts. The system therefore requires no energy input except for the influent pump and has a much lower propensity for mechanical failure than other clarifiers. This advantage extends to safety considerations when operating the plant. The absence of mechanical parts results in a safer working environment, with less possibility for injury. Whilst the lamella clarifier has overcome many difficulties encountered by the use of more traditional clarifiers, there are still some disadvantages involved with the configuration and running of the equipment. Lamella clarifiers are unable to treat most raw feed mixtures, which require some pre-treatment to remove materials that could decrease separation efficiency. The feed requires initial processing in advanced fine screening and grit and grease removal to ensure the influent mixture is of an appropriate composition. The layout of the clarifier creates extra turbulence as the water turns a corner from the feed to the inclined plates. This area of increased turbulence coincides with the sludge collection point and the flowing water can cause some re suspension of solids, whilst simultaneously diluting the sludge. This results in the need for further treatment to remove the excess moisture from the sludge. Clarifier inlets and discharge must be designed to distribute flow evenly. Regular maintenance is required as sludge flows down the inclined plates leaving them dirty. Regular cleaning helps prevent uneven flow distribution. Additionally, poorly maintained plates can cause uneven flow distribution and sacrifice the efficiency of the process. The closely packed plates make the cleaning difficult. However, removable and independently supported lamellar plates can be installed. Commercially available lamella clarifiers require different concrete basin geometry and structural support to conventional clarifications system widely used in industry, thus increasing the cost of installing a new (lamellar) clarification system.  Available designs  Typical lamella clarifier design consists of a series of inclined plates inside a vessel, see first figure. The untreated feed water stream enters from the top of the vessel and flows down a feed channel underneath the inclined plates. Water then flows up inside the clarifier between the inclined plates. During this time solids settle onto the plates and eventually fall to the bottom of the vessel. The route a particle takes will be dependent upon the flow rate of the suspension and the settling rate of the particle and can be seen in the second figure. At the bottom of the vessel a hopper or funnel collects these particles as sludge. Sludge may be continuously or intermittently discharged. Above the inclined plates all particles have settled and clarified water is produced which is drawn off into an outlet channel. The clarified water exits the system in an outlet stream. Lamella clarifier schematic. Particle settling behaviour (lamella clarifier).There are a number of proprietary lamella clarifier designs. Inclined plates may be based on circular, hexagonal or rectangular tubes. Some possible design characteristics include: * Tube or plate spacing of 50 mm * Tube or plate length 1‚Äì2 m * Plate pitches between 45¬∞ and 70¬∞ allow for self- cleaning, lower pitches require backwash * Minimum plate pitch 7¬∞ * Typical loading rates are 5 to 10 m/h  Main process characteristics  Lamella clarifiers can handle a maximum feed water concentration of 10000 mg/L of grease and 3000 mg/L of solids. Expected separation efficiencies for a typical unit are: * 90-99% removal of free oils and greases under standard operation conditions. * 20-40% removal of emulsified oils and greases with no chemical amendment. * 50-99% removal with the addition of chemical agent(s). * Treated water has a turbidity of around 1-2 NTU. Initial investment required for a typical lamella clarifier varies from US$750 to US$2500 per cubic meter of water to be treated, depending on the design of the clarifier. The surface loading rate (also known as surface overflow rate or surface settling rate) for a lamella clarifier falls between 10‚Äì25 m/h. For these settling rates, the retention time in the clarifier is low, at around 20 minutes or less, with operating capacities tending to range from 1‚Äì3 m3/hour/m2 (of projected area).  Assessment of characteristics  Separation of solids is described by sedimentation effectiveness, Œ∑. Which is dependent on concentration, flow rate, particle size distribution, flow patterns and plate packing and is defined by the following equation. Œ∑ = (c1-c2)/c2 where c1 is inlet concentration and c2 outlet concentration. Inclined angle of plates allows for increased loading rate/throughput and decreased retention time relative to conventional clarifiers. Increase in the loading rate of 2-3 times the conventional clarifier (of the same size). The total surface area required for settling can be calculated for a lamella plate with N plates, each plate of width W, with plate pitch Œ∏ and tube spacing p. Where, A = W‚àô(Np+cosŒ∏) Table 1 presents the characteristics and operating ranges of different clarification units. {  - ! Clarification unit !! Overflow rate (m3/m2/h) !! Retention time (min) !! Turbidity removal efficiency (%) -  Lamella clarifier  5-12  60-120  90-95 -  Rectangular  1-2  120-180  90-95 -  Circular  1-3  60-120  90-95 -  Floc blanket  1-3  120-180  90-95 -  Sand ballasted  < 200  5-7  90-99 -  Sludge recirculation  < 120  10-16  90-99 -  Magnetite  < 30  15  90-99 } Where overflow rate is a measure of the fluid loading capacity of the clarifier and is defined as, the influent flow rate divided by the horizontal area of the clarifier. The retention time is the average time that a particulate remains in the clarifier. The turbidity is a measure of cloudiness. Higher values for turbidity removal efficiency correspond to less particulates remaining in the clarified stream. The settling velocity of a particulate can also be determined by using Stokes' law.  Design heuristics  * Rise rate: Rise rates can be between 0.8 and 4.88 m/h from different sources (Kucera, 2011). * Plate loading: Loadings on plates should be limited to 2.9 m/h to ensure laminar flow is maintained between plates. * Plate angle: The general consensus is that plates should be inclined at a 50-70¬∞ angle from the horizontal to allow for self-cleaning. This results in the projected plate area of the lamella clarifier taking up approximately 50% of the space of a conventional clarifier. * Plate spacing: Typical spacing between plates is 50 mm, though plates can be spaced in the range of 50‚Äì80 mm apart, given that the particles > 50 mm in size have been removed in pre-treatment stages. * Plate length: Depending on the scale of the system, total plate lengths can vary, however, the plate length should allow for the plates to rise 125 mm above the top water level, with 1.5 m of space left below the plates at the bottom of the clarifier for collection of sludge. Most plates have a length of 1‚Äì2 m. * Plate materials: Plates should be made of stainless steel, with the exception of situations in which the system has been dosed with chlorine to prevent algal growth. In these circumstances, the plates may be plastic or plastic coated. * Feed point: Feed should be introduced at least 20% above the base of the plate to prevent disturbance of the settling zones at the base of the plates.  Post-treatment systems  Both the overflow stream and the underflow stream from a lamella clarifier will often require post-treatment. The underflow stream is often put through a dewatering process such as a thickener or a belt press filter to increase the density of slurry. This is an important post-treatment as the underflow slurry is often not able to be recycled back into the process. In such a case it often needs to be transported to a disposal plant, and the cost of this transport depends on the volume and weight of the slurry. Hence an efficient dewatering process can result in a substantial cost saving. Where the slurry can be recycled through the process it often needs to be dried, and dewatering again is an important step in this process. The post-treatment required for the overflow stream depends both on the nature of the inlet stream and what the overflow will be used for. For example, if the fluid being put through the lamella clarifier comes from a heavy industrial plant it may require post-treatment to remove oil and grease especially if the effluent is going to be discharged to the environment. A separation process unit such as a coalescer is often used to physically trigger a separation of the water and the oils. For the treatment of potable water the overflow from the lamella clarifier will require further treatment to remove organic molecules as well as disinfection to remove bacteria. It will also be passed through a series of polishing units to remove the odour and improve the colour of the water. There is a tendency with lamella clarifiers for algae to grow on the inclined plates and this can be a problem especially if the overflow is being discharged to the environment or if the lamella clarifier is being utilized as pre-treatment for a membrane filtration unit. In either of these cases the overflow requires post-treatment such as an anthracite-sand filter to prevent the algae from spreading downstream of the lamella clarifier. As the inclined plates in the lamella clarifier are made of steel it is not recommended that chlorine be used to control the biological growth as it could accelerate the corrosion of the plates.  New developments  One variation on the standard design of a lamella clarifier being developed is the way the effluent is collected at the top of the inclined plates. Rather than the effluent flowing over the top of the inclined plates to the outlet channel it flows through orifices at the top of the plates. This design allows for more consistent back pressure in the channels between the plates and hence a more consistent flow profile develops. Obviously this design only works for relatively clean effluent streams as the orifices would quickly become blocked with deposits which would severely reduce the efficiency of the unit. Another new design includes an adjustable upper portion of the vessel so that vessel height can be changed. This height adjustment is relative to a deflector, which directs the inlet stream. This design intended to be used for decanting storm water. Another design variation, which improves the efficiency of the separation unit is the way the effluent enters the lamella clarifier. Standard clarifier design has the effluent entering at the bottom of the inclined plates, colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates. This mixing region renders the bottom 20% of the inclined plates unusable for settling. By designing the lamella clarifier so that the effluent enters the inclined plates without interfering with the downward slurry flow the capacity of the lamella clarifier can be improved by 25%.

It was once the dominant language of the region, but a long-time policy of Francization, starting with the introduction of French as the language of education in 1853, has led to the replacement of Dutch with French in the region. Of the population of the approximately 380,000 inhabitants of French Westhoek, there are now between 10,000 and 20,000 daily speakers of West Flemish, many of whom live in the arrondissement and city of Dunkirk, and twice as many who occasionally use the dialect.

So Maggie has an uphill climb.\\" Ms. Stone's ambiguous exit leaves viewers wondering whether she'll return, yet an AMC rep says nothing is planned at this time. Bianca was portrayed by Eden Riegel, and Maggie was portrayed by Elizabeth Hendrickson. Lorraine Broderick created and introduced Bianca in 1988, and Agnes Nixon expanded on the character, scripting her as a lesbian and making her the first lead character on a major daytime drama to be a lesbian. Hendrickson was originally brought on as character Frankie Stone; the storyline revolved around the close relationship of Bianca and Frankie, as well as the aftermath of Frankie's death. When her death attracted criticism, writer Richard Culliton decided to bring the actress back as the character's identical twin sister, Maggie Stone. Maggie debuted on the show in 2002, to investigate her sister's murder, and was immediately thereafter set up to bond with Bianca. The two characters became the center of an on-again, off-again romantic flirtation that developed into a romance, which spanned four years all together. Star-crossed true loves, the pairing was planned to have various ups and downs; they sought friendship and security in their need for solidarity, and dealt with sexual confusion and ambiguity in their struggle to remain platonic. Though the series paced Bianca and Maggie's relationship for three and a half years before making the couple's romance official, the pairing consistently intrigued the All My Children audience, as well as soap opera critics and LGBT outlets such as The Advocate and AfterEllen.com. They subsequently became the most demanded homosexual pairing in American daytime soap opera history, and are daytime television's first same-sex supercouple. Background Writing Before Frankie Stone's introduction, former All My Children head writer Richard Culliton already planned for her to die in a murder storyline after three months on the series. Culliton and ABC executives were surprised when viewers became attached to the romance between Bianca and Frankie, developed by Culliton with Frankie's debut. These fans attributed Frankie's death to the show's fear to focus on a lesbian romance. Eventually, Culliton came up with the idea to bring back the popular actress who had portrayed Frankie, Elizabeth Hendrickson, as the character's identical twin sister. He continued to write for the show until late 2002. Television executive Brian Frons held a six-year position with SBS Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, where he worked on a number of popular reality shows. When he became head of ABC Daytime in 2002, he pushed for ABC's soap operas, which he felt had become clich√©-ridden and predictable, to become more realistic. With Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, Frons had ABC begin adding more depth to All My Children's Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian daughter of Susan Lucci's Erica Kane. Feeling that Bianca was defined only by her sexuality, they began writing her character \\"to become everywoman, to make her more real and to understand what makes her good or bad\\". Writers were initially uncertain whether to pair Maggie romantically with Bianca; they did not want Maggie to be a copy of Frankie, and subsequently scripted Maggie as heterosexual with various aspects of her personality different than Frankie's. Complicating matters further, Bianca was given a different lesbian love interest, Lena Kundera. At the time, in an interview reported by the New York Post, Frons stated that he considered the Lena and Bianca pairing \\"much bolder\\" than romantically pairing Bianca with \\"longtime\\" galpal Maggie. However, he expressed uncertainty about pairing Maggie with a man. \\"Maybe it will be decided that Maggie has no chemistry with Henry because she is a lesbian and wasn't ready to deal with it,\\" he said. When choosing Maggie's love interests, the audience often seemed to have as much say about the matter as Frons. Before Maggie's relationship with character Henry Chin came to an end, viewers refused to give their romance a chance, adamant that the only true love for Maggie had to be Bianca. Ivan Shaw, Henry's then-portrayer, relied on optimism. \\"I have definitely felt the heat from all of the Bianca and Maggie fans, but hope that the Henry and Maggie relationship will eventually win them over,\\" he said. Viewers, however, were persistent in their opposition to Henry and Maggie's relationship, and the writers soon created an exit for Henry to leave town. Maggie is soon seen questioning her sexual orientation due to sensing romantic feelings on her part for Bianca. Early scenes between Bianca and Maggie revolve around the two romantically desiring each other but often secretly. As time goes on, conflict between Lena and Maggie becomes apparent. Maggie dates men to negate her sexual attraction to Bianca, her \\"coming-out\\" process designed as going from denial, to confusion, to acceptance of her sexuality -- a portrayal lauded as representative of real-life experiences of lesbians and bisexual women. Bianca was not written to face exactly the same struggle with her sexuality onscreen; she largely comes to terms with her sexual orientation before returning to Pine Valley in 2000 after a time of absence from the series. By the time Megan McTavish stepped in as head writer with Julie Hanan Carruthers as executive producer, McTavish explained that Maggie's involvement with character Jonathan Lavery was mostly a result of her feeling rejected by Bianca. Though the writers had Maggie accept her sexual interest in Bianca, the character was once again written to deny being sexually attracted to women; her relationship with Jonathan was now her main focus and the possibility of her wanting Bianca as a lover was now retracted. With viewers indifferent about the Lena/Bianca/Maggie love triangle, a story arc was written pushing a Jonathan/Maggie/Bianca love triangle. This second love triangle developed slowly, but included an aspect that kept viewers invested: Jonathan is presented as an abuser, and Bianca feels she must fight to free Maggie of his control. Maggie's new denial does not last long, and the character later admits her desire to start a life with Bianca. Fan response to the Bianca and Maggie romance was mostly positive, and the arc worked towards the goals of realism Frons wanted to convey. He believed \\"it was very real and had not been done in daytime [television] before\\". Actresses Hendrickson had not originally planned on working on soap operas. She believed the medium would not challenge her acting. After a few years of struggling to acquire a steady acting job, however, she decided to give the daytime genre a chance and agreed to a contract role with the show. She soon came to regard the soap opera industry as challenging. Eden Riegel, who signed on one year earlier and had formerly appeared on Broadway, was also apprehensive about joining a soap opera, but was convinced by her parents. She later attributed her reluctance to elitism. Actress Olga Sosnovska was brought on as Lena Kundera, to add conflict to Bianca and Maggie's relationship; the writers introduced Lena in December 2002, as a \\"sassy\\" bisexual from Poland, characterized as a temptress \\"in the mold of Juliette Binoche\\". Sosnovska was asked if she realized that by accepting this role she would be stepping into \\"so much\\" controversy. \\"I‚Äôm still coming to terms with this phenomenon of Lianca,\\" she replied, \\"with the devotion that I‚Äôm shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It‚Äôs horrible that even now in the 21st century [so many lesbians] feel the need to hide. Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment.\\" The couples became popular, but viewers and critics such as magazine Soap Opera Digest especially cited a positive working dynamic between Riegel and Hendrickson. The two women, though both heterosexual in real life, stated that they \\"just clicked\\" and enjoy each other's company. When later queried on the viewer demand for a romance between Bianca and Maggie, the actresses relayed their support for gay and lesbian representation in television, with Riegel stating: \\"I think Liz [Hendrickson] will agree that it would be an amazing storyline. [...] I realize what an incredible opportunity we have to show a real love between two women that really speaks to people and can promote tolerance and respect.\\" Hendrickson followed up: \\"That's one of the reasons that I took the role of Frankie. They didn't necessarily say that Frankie was going to be a lesbian, but they alluded to the fact that she could be. I felt that I could make an impact, and what better way to choose a role? I am more than willing to go that way.\\" Riegel and Hendrickson have described an emotional investment in their characters driven by impact on fans and positive fan response. Music Music within Bianca and Maggie's relationship consisted of soft rock, pop and the show's own original melodies. In a less hectic time for the characters, an original song titled \\"All I Ever Wanted Was You\\" was played during a scene where Bianca and Maggie discussed their feelings for each other, but decided to remain best friends. Original and featured music on the show was followed through by composers A.J. Gundell, Gary Kuo, Kim Oler and Jerry Pilato. In 2004, they were nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the 31st Annual Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement In Music Direction And Composition For A Drama Series. Storyline In 2002, Maggie Stone comes to Pine Valley to investigate the murder of her twin sister, Frankie, whom Bianca mistakes her for at first sight. Their meeting is set up by Kendall Hart (Alicia Minshew), Bianca's sister, who loathes Bianca. She figures that Bianca will be hurt by seeing someone who looks exactly like Frankie, Bianca's deceased girlfriend. Maggie explains who she is, but Bianca is too happy to see Frankie‚Äôs face and does not understand Maggie's words completely at first. Kendall's plan having backfired, Bianca and Maggie meet later, where they discuss Frankie in further detail. Maggie reconnects with her family, Vanessa Cortlandt (Marj Dusay), Leo du Pres (Josh Duhamel) and David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry), whom she barely knows. Bianca bonds with Maggie. Together, they work to find Frankie‚Äôs killer. After discovering Frankie was killed by her Aunt Vanessa‚Äôs henchman, Maggie confronts Vanessa. Maggie is drugged and left to die in an abandoned pump house, but is rescued by David and Leo. As time passes, Maggie begins to care for her family, but her bond with Bianca grows even stronger. She becomes furious, however, when a drunken Bianca attempts to caress her face. Maggie asserts that she is not a lesbian, unlike her sister. Bianca and Maggie later reconcile, and the two develop a solid friendship after Maggie assists Bianca in confronting some homophobic, high school bullies. They attend prom together as a platonic couple. Bianca develops the fear that she is using Maggie as a replacement to Frankie, and the sexual tension between the two causes Bianca to push Maggie into briefly dating good guy Tim Dillon. Bianca later provides comfort for Maggie when Leo is killed, and some time later decides to confront Maggie about her feelings. Maggie admits that she loves Bianca, but asserts that she is \\"into guys\\" and apologizes for not being able to be Bianca's lover. Bianca admits that she is hurt, but vows to move on. Maggie enrolls at Pine Valley University, where she enters into a romantic relationship with classmate Henry Chin. Despite the tension caused by Henry‚Äôs traditional Chinese family, who see Maggie as a distraction, it is Henry cheating off of Maggie's test that causes their relationship to end. Bianca, also a student at the university, cheers Maggie up. Still looking for romance, she begins dating Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska), and becomes oblivious to Maggie‚Äôs signs of jealousy. In 2003, summer, Bianca is raped by Michael Cambias (William deVry); Maggie helps her through the mental anguish during the aftermath, and Bianca keeps the rape a secret from everyone else. She attributes her change in attitude to her ended relationship with Lena. Maggie tries to persuade her to go to the police, but Bianca convinces Maggie not to talk to them, saying that she will not either. When Michael avoids punishment for raping Bianca and she relays to Maggie that she is pregnant with Michael's child, Maggie buys a gun and secretly plans to kill him. Bianca decides that she will keep the baby. Fearing that her mother, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), will resent her baby due to having been raped before as well, Bianca decides that she is going to leave town to give birth to the child and inform everyone on her return that she adopted. Erica finds out about her pregnancy, however, and encourages her to have an abortion for her own sake. Bianca says that she will, but secretly changes her mind. During this time, Kendall finds out, and she and Bianca grow close. The two forge a deep bond. Michael's dead body turns up before Maggie can kill him. It is revealed that as she stood outside Michael's condo, she saw two mysterious figures dragging a large bag from it, causing her to flee. Everyone a suspect in the Michael murder case at this point, Maggie tells Bianca that even though he deserved it, she could not have killed him in cold blood. Over time, Maggie begins to show more signs that she desires Bianca, making excuses to distance herself from her after making flattering remarks about her appearance. In 2004, Bianca announces to Maggie that she plans to move to Paris, so that she can give birth without her mother finding out. This causes Maggie to become emotional, and she confuses herself and Bianca when she kisses Bianca. Embarrassed, she abruptly leaves the apartment. She is panicked and immediately has sex with Jamie Martin (Justin Bruening) upon fleeing. When Maggie returns to the apartment the following morning, on Bianca's birthday, she tells Bianca that the kiss meant nothing. Immediately after their talk, she begins dating Jamie, as Bianca continues her romance with Lena. Everyone becomes aware that Bianca is pregnant when it is revealed that her sister, who was covering for her, is not the pregnant one. The truth about Michael's death is soon unveiled, as it comes to light that Bianca killed Michael in self- defense, not remembering this until Michael's murder trial, where her sister and mother are both willing to confess to killing him. It turns out that the two figures Maggie saw that night at his condo were Kendall and one of Bianca's cousins trying to protect Bianca. The judge sees the painful ordeal Bianca has been through following her rape and Michael's death, and Bianca is not charged with any crime. More strife, however, comes when Bianca is told that the baby she just gave birth to is dead. Maggie becomes even more of a support line for her, but Lena leaves town to care for her ailing mother back in Poland. Maggie eventually professes her love to Bianca, feeling that this is her \\"coming out\\" moment. Bianca informs her that she does not want to begin a relationship with her because she is still in love with Lena and she does not want Maggie regretting her decision later. Hurt by Bianca‚Äôs rejection, as well as her distorted perception of Bianca's bond with Babe Carey (Alexa Havins), Maggie distances herself from Bianca and begins dating Jonathan Lavery (Jeff Branson). Maggie‚Äôs relationship with Jonathan becomes abusive, when Jonathan believes Maggie is secretly in love with Bianca. Jonathan intentionally tries to isolate Maggie from Bianca, and proposes marriage to her. Maggie agrees, but Jonathan‚Äôs jealousy turns physical against Maggie. Bianca becomes concerned with Maggie‚Äôs relationship, as she feels that something is off about it and later believes Maggie to have lied about a bruise on her face. She visits Jonathan and Maggie‚Äôs home while Maggie is alone and tries to reason with her to leave him. Her emotions get the better of her and she kisses Maggie. She confesses that she has fallen in love with her. Initially dismissing Bianca‚Äôs declaration of love, Maggie learns the truth about Jonathan's abusive past with his previous girlfriend and dumps him. Free from Jonathan, Bianca and Maggie decide to move to Paris with Bianca‚Äôs newly-discovered-alive daughter, Miranda (Haley Evans), in February 2005. When Bianca returns for a Christmas visit to Pine Valley, she tells everyone that she and Maggie are an official couple in Paris, advising Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) to be happy with Kendall, because she is very happy with Maggie. Despite this, when she returns again near Thanksgiving in 2006, bringing her daughter with her, she informs everyone that Maggie had an affair with a woman named Cecelia. Bianca says that she would still take Maggie back. During a phone call, though, it is clear that Maggie does not want that. Bianca is left further devastated, but still voices to wanting Maggie. However, when Maggie shows up in early 2007 on Bianca's doorstep wanting to renew their romance, Bianca does not, and Maggie later has a confrontation with Zoe (Jeffrey Carlson), someone else who wants a romance with Bianca. Zoe is a transgender rockstar, biologically male but identifying herself as a lesbian woman. Zoe asks Maggie how could she cheat on Bianca, and Maggie angers. Harsh words are exchanged between the two. Before the confrontation is over, Maggie warns Zoe not to hurt Bianca, but notes that Zoe will never be Bianca's type, regardless. On February 7, 2007, Maggie meets with Bianca at a park and kisses her, and Bianca admits that she has never stopped being in love with Maggie. Despite this, she agrees that Maggie should leave. She relays that she needs some time away from her, but that they can keep in touch through e-mails. Bianca informs her that there is still a chance that they may once again be together. Maggie hugs Bianca. \\"You were my first love,\\" she says, and confesses, \\"You're my everything.\\" She then walks away. Reception and impact General As one of the few lesbian romances depicted on daytime television, Bianca and Maggie's romance gave lesbian viewers a pairing they could relate to, and inspired closeted lesbian viewers to reveal their sexuality. In addition, the romance was appreciated by heterosexual fans. In 2005, the couple's second kiss (their first having taken place the previous year) was ranked #4 on TV Guide's list of the best same-sex kisses on television. The kiss was also listed as one of television's most \\"unforgettable kisses\\" in Andr√©a Demirjian's 2006 book Kissing, with the rating of \\"Really Good\\". In October 2008, Soaps In Depth named Bianca and Maggie one of soap opera's 100 greatest couples. Bianca being brought back to the series in 2000 made her the first major character on a soap opera to come out as gay or lesbian. All My Children was consistently nominated thereafter by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for its \\"fair, accurate, and inclusive portrayal\\" of a lesbian teenager and her mother's process of coming to terms with her daughter's homosexuality. However, until recently, Bianca fell exclusively for perceived straight or unattainable women, which prevented her from having an on-screen girlfriend. GLAAD Director of Communications, John Sonego, contends that \\"Many young, newly out lesbians fall for a close friend, only to discover the friend is straight\\" and that on television \\"unrequited love...and heartbreak are what keep the viewers tuning in -- and learning\\". Initially, Maggie, who continually asserted her heterosexuality, seemed to be a continuation of this trend. BAM Though GLAAD was pleased with Bianca's \\"coming out\\" storyline and awarded her their first Favorite Out Image of the Year Award, two years of no on-screen romance for Bianca frustrated fans who supported a relationship between Bianca and Maggie; these fans formed a shipping community that came to refer to the match-up as \\"BAM\\" (for Bianca and Maggie). In October 2008, Soaps In Depth named Bianca and Maggie one of soap opera's 100 greatest couples. According to their website, BAMFan members are a diverse group of all ages, economic, and cultural backgrounds, and sexual orientations and \\"want to ensure the story ‚Äì the romance of Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone ‚Äì is brought to the forefront of All My Children\\". BAM fans were vocal and persistent in campaigning to writers and executive producers of All My Children for inclusion of the relationship. They sent letters, videos, T-shirts, and roses to the network. To enable others, particularly new viewers to the series, with easy access to the Bianca and Maggie storyline, BAM fans launched what they call \\"BAMChannel\\" on the video sharing site YouTube. The channel chronicles Bianca and Maggie's relationship, from their first meeting to their recent status, as well as Bianca's relationship with Maggie's deceased twin, Frankie. Hendrickson in her All My Children dressing room, with Absolute BAM poster in the background. The fans sent gifts to Hendrickson and Riegel. \\"I won't work for several days and then I'll come back and my room is filled with boxes. It's hysterical!\\" exclaimed Hendrickson, who cited her favorite gift as being her \\"Absolute BAM\\" poster, a reference to Absolut Vodka, and also confirmed receiving a wooden clock labeled \\"TIME FOR BAM!\\" Riegel received the gifts positively as well: \\"[BAM] sent me and Liz [Hendrickson] this big package with presents, hats and posters that say 'Absolute BAM'. All of them wrote us these wonderful notes about what the characters and the storyline means to them. I don't know how this happened, but I'm incredibly inspired and energized by it.\\" For her July 3 birthday, Hendrickson encouraged fans to donate to an animal shelter in her town instead of shower her with additional gifts. Most dramatically, BAM fans raised money to launch a blimp to hover above the building; this plan was not completed. BAM fans' efforts drew the attention of leading soap opera magazines, which frequently commented on the widespread fan support for Bianca and Maggie's relationship; they were voted \\"Best Non- Couple\\" of the year by readers in the December 31, 2002 Soap Opera Digest issue. LGBT newspaper The Advocate took notice of the pairing's support. \\"Ironically, the move to provide Bianca with a girlfriend might disappoint the fans who've been cheering the most for it,\\" stated Web Behrens of the paper in her April 29, 2003 article. \\"When our lesbian protagonist finally gets her groove on, it won't be with Maggie, who flirted with Bianca for months, [spawning a devoted fan club named BAM]... But the object of Bianca's affection will instead be the mysterious bisexual Lena (played by Olga Sosnovska), a newcomer to the fictional town of Pine Valley.\\" Jean Dadario Burke, the show's then-executive producer, was noted as saying, \\"There was wonderful chemistry with Bianca and Maggie.\\" Regardless, Brian Frons, who had become head of ABC Daytime, somewhat based his reasoning for not going through with the romance when demand for it was the most prominent. \\"Rather than trust that momentum, 'cowardly network people that we are, we did some research,'\\" he said. \\"After polling 1,500 soap fans about Bianca's love life, the network found that many viewers wanted Bianca to have a romance -- with someone else.\\" The assessment made by Frons differed from a previous article earlier in the year which cited the Bianca and Maggie fanbase as growing bigger and at an unprecedented level in American daytime soap opera history for a homosexual pairing. Three years after his 2003 comments, Frons titled Bianca and Maggie \\"the supercouple of daytime\\". Maggie's sexuality Substantial reasoning fans in the poll Frons alluded to may have wanted to see Bianca with another woman as opposed to Maggie was likely due to Maggie's ambiguous nature during her early relationship with Bianca. Fans consistently wondered whether or not Maggie was gay, which spun into \\"heated\\" debate regarding Maggie or Lena being better suited for Bianca. Hendrickson weighed in on her character's mixed signals. \\"There's a huge question mark hanging over her head, isn't there?\\" she said. \\"But I think that almost any woman at that age [has one]. I think every woman and every man, at some point at their life... It's only natural to think twice about your sexual orientation.\\" Maggie's sexual identity perplexed the soap opera media as well. Their confusion regarding Maggie's sexual identity led to Soaps In Depth putting Bianca and Maggie on the cover of a 2003 October issue detailing November storylines with the caption \\"Together At Last!\\", though the actual article did not document an opportunity of a romantic relationship between the two. In a Soap Opera Weekly issue, editor Carolyn Hinsey and Soap Opera Digest/All My Children editor Mara Levinsky sat down to debate Maggie's sexual orientation. Hinsey felt that Maggie was a \\"flip-flopper\\" and that it was odd that she could \\"jump between the sexes\\" as quickly as she did when, in reality, she wanted Bianca. Levinsky argued Maggie's confusion and frustration. \\"She's on the rebound, and as likely if not likelier to go out with a guy to try to forget Bianca than a girl,\\" Levinsky stated. \\"Maggie knows she's attracted to Bianca, but Bianca is the only girl she's ever been attracted to.\\" Maggie's sexual interaction with guys, however, was consistently scripted by the series to showcase itself as a direct response to her denying her feelings for Bianca or what she felt was Bianca having rejected her. Years later, the story reveals her attraction to women as not exclusive to Bianca. Chemistry and confessions Bianca and Maggie's romantic chemistry was complimented by critics, who deemed themselves fans of the pairing. Critics cited feeling cheated out of opportunities to see the full potential of the pairing's chemistry. TV Guide soap opera columnist Michael Logan dubbed the non-relationship as \\"Rip-Off of the Year\\" in his January 4, 2003 roundup of \\"The Worst of 2002\\". He stated: Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com expressed her thoughts about the \\"never-ending sexual tension\\" between Bianca and Maggie as well. \\"Bianca hasn't seen any action at all, partly because she mostly manages to fall for straight or unavailable women, including her close friend Maggie,\\" she stated. \\"The two characters have exchanged intimate gazes and frolicked provocatively in countless scenes, the tension becoming so unbearable that frustrated fans formed BAM.\\" Riegel and Hendrickson were asked by Soap Opera Digest what they thought accounted for their on-screen chemistry. While Riegel replied that \\"chemistry can't be faked, and when two people like each other, there's an energy between them that's undeniable\\", Hendrickson stated, \\"When I started, my friends were telling me what great chemistry we had, and I didn't notice it. But now that I've worked with probably half the cast, I realize what amazing chemistry we have together. I'll have to work with men and really, I'm heterosexual, but I have more chemistry with her! I'm trying to have romances with boys, but I don't know, I just feel it with her!\\" On June 13, 2004, New York Daily News became another aspect of the media taking interest in the love story when they reported the week in which Maggie would finally admit to being in love with Bianca. The news was followed by soap opera press covering the event as well. \\"It's the moment BAM fans have been waiting for on All My Children, but thought would never come: Maggie finally 'fesses up to Bianca about her true feelings for her 'best friend',\\" announced Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson was excited about the revelation. She stated, \\"It's about time!\\" She expressed that she \\"could not believe [her] eyes\\" when she read the dialogue for her character. \\"When I read the scene where Maggie tells Bianca she loves her,\\" said Hendrickson, \\"I was sure that the next day, Maggie would backpedal like she always does, like, 'I meant, \\"I love you as a friend.\\"' I was so excited to get the next script and find out that she doesn't backpedal. She's honest, forward and open about her feelings. It took her two-and-a-half years, but she does it!\\" Despite Maggie confessing her feelings to Bianca, Bianca is the one to turn down their chance this time; she expresses that her heart, in the romantic sense, belongs to Lena. The performance by Hendrickson in the scenes were praised by soap opera critics, who felt that it added new depth to the character. Fundraising and merchandising On July 8, 2003, Tori Amos's version of \\"I'm Not in Love\\" was featured prominently on the show during the scene in which Bianca is raped. The following day, the show broadcast a RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network) PSA after the program. In response to the rape storyline, fans of the Bianca and Maggie relationship organized a charity auction on eBay that ran throughout the month of July 2003 with all proceeds having gone to RAINN. SOAPnet BAM ID bracelet On November 1, 2004, SOAPnet, described as the new way to watch soaps, launched shopsoapnet.com. The site is an on-line shopping boutique which offers customers SOAPnet-themed items, including products from its original programs I Wanna Be A Soap Star and Soap Talk, as well as exclusive SOAPnet-brand merchandise. SOAPnet stated that they are always looking for unique ways to put a new twist on a long- loved genre. One aspect of their marketing was to make popular soap opera couples a part of the equation. With Bianca and Maggie's visibility as one of the more \\"in-demand\\" couples, ABC saw this as part of their market. \\"Soap opera fans have a history of supporting character couples and giving their favorite couples nicknames that combine the letters of the characters' names. For example, fans of a Nikolas and Emily pairing on General Hospital refer to the couple as 'NEM'. Shopsoapnet.com will honor this tradition by offering limited edition bracelets engraved with a few of these popular couple names including NEM and BAM. BAM honors a Bianca and Maggie pairing on All My Children,\\" the press release stated. The Bianca and Maggie (BAM) ID bracelet originally went on sale for $14.95, as seen in the ABC TV Store with the advertisement of the couple's star-crossed predicament: > BAM bracelet -- All My Children‚Äôs Bianca and Maggie (BAM) may not be a soap > super couple...YET! That doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt show your support for > the intriguing duo that can‚Äôt quite seem to get together (it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre > distracted or something) with this stylish brushed-pewter/nickel-plated ID > emblem featuring engraved lettering, a 6 ¬æ\\" velvet strap in forest green and > adjustable chain strap. Limited edition. In December 2008, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, which raises funds for HIV/AIDS-related causes, started contest Battle of the ABC Daytime \\"Power Couples\\" for the 2009 year. Though no longer a couple and not on the Broadway Cares official list for the competition, Team BAM was created in honor of Bianca and Maggie and for the organization's cause. The team said Bianca and Maggie's story \\"never ended\\" and that for \\"the fans who fell in love with this couple, and watched them from the early days of friendship, through personal struggles and triumphs, with the hope that their dream would be realized and these two best friends and soul mates would finally be together, the story will live on forever\\". They stated, \\"When all the money was in and the final numbers tallied, Team BAM finished in the top 4.\\" The team's goal was to achieve $500.00. They report having achieved $3,900.00. Departure and return Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com had previously commented on All My Children stalling Bianca's romantic life by making her pregnant. Warn stated that it was a way to assure Bianca's continued asexuality. She added that \\"the pregnant-lesbian storyline\\" is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to \\"normalize\\" the lesbian characters ‚Äì \\"to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women ‚Äì who of course, all want to be mothers\\". When Riegel and Hendrickson left their roles together in 2005, with their characters being written out as possible lovers, Warn's disappointment in the show's writing team remained. She cited Bianca and Maggie's progression toward romance only after leaving television screens, but detailed positive aspects of the story in an article entitled \\"The End of a Lesbian Era on All My Children\\". A farewell was given to the pairing, with Warn stating, \\"Today, as All My Children airs its final episode with actresses Eden Riegel and Elizabeth Hendrickson (who have left the series to try their luck elsewhere), we say goodbye to one of American television's longer-running lesbian storylines -- a storyline which has alternately entranced, infuriated, delighted and frustrated viewers over the last four and a half years.\\" Warn also commented on Bianca and Maggie's star-crossed dynamic, reasoning \\"while stringing out romantic storylines for maximum drama is appropriate and even expected in daytime television, it is also expected that, eventually, star- crossed couples do get together\\". In early 2007, the series decided to bring the couple back. Viewers watched as Bianca relayed news that Maggie cheated on her while in Paris. Bianca fled back to Pine Valley, and Maggie soon followed to plead for her forgiveness. Viewers felt that it was out of character for Maggie to cheat on Bianca. Hendrickson was also upset about the storyline. Soap Opera Weekly magazine's January 23, 2007 issue quoted Hendrickson as saying that she found out about Maggie cheating on Bianca by watching the show (since her character had not returned to Pine Valley at the time). \\"I was screaming and yelling at the TV. I was very upset. It was a huge shock to me,\\" she relayed. Although, there was something Hendrickson was pleased about with the storyline of Maggie returning to chase after Bianca -- Maggie's sexuality. It was apparent that Maggie had come to terms with being a lesbian. While upset that Maggie cheated on Bianca, Hendrickson was content that Maggie cheated on Bianca with a woman, confessing that she had always felt that Maggie was leaning more toward the women than the men; she relayed her happiness about the writers having made a decision about Maggie's sexuality. Soaps In Depth also sought to clear up Maggie's sexual orientation when they cited her as a lesbian while recapping her history the week of her return. From the AMC Hotsheet: For our newer viewers, here's a re-cap of Maggie's history: She came to town in 2002 after the death of her twin sister Frankie. She dated Henry Chin and Jonathan Lavery (who abused her) before realizing she was gay. She then developed a deep friendship with Bianca Montgomery which turned to love. She left with Bianca in 2005 to attend Medical School in Paris. While in Paris, she cheated on Bianca with another woman. Now, she's returned and wants Bianca back! Maggie being complete in her sexuality with Bianca was something viewers had wanted for years; it was tainted with the cheating storyline. Unlike Hendrickson, Riegel found the news of Maggie's betrayal refreshing: \\"It's so funny how the fans are all up in arms like, 'Maggie would never cheat!' When they told me Maggie was cheating, I went like, 'Woo hoo!' because an actor wants interesting stuff to play.\\" Riegel approached the matter in humor and seriousness: \\"Oh yeah, Maggie's a slutty lesbian!\\" Riegel laughed, adding that \\"because Bianca has now lost this love, she's looking to reinvent herself and looking for answers\\". Another element agitating the audience during and after Maggie's return was Bianca's romantic attraction to transgender Zarf/Zoe. Zarf/Zoe was still of the male form, and viewers felt that it was an \\"underhanded\\" way for the show to romantically pair Bianca with a \\"man\\" while getting around the reality of Zarf/Zoe's anatomy. Victoria A. Brownworth of the San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly newspaper serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities, called the storyline a mess. Brownworth felt that it had an unhealthy angle to it, and made several comments voicing her and her publication's detest toward the romance. TV Guide named Zarf/Zoe, as well as her storyline, one of the worst of 2007. Maggie eventually returned to Paris at Bianca's request, but with a hint that they may once again be united. \\"Bianca still loves her,\\" former head writer Megan McTavish assured the audience. \\"And yet, at the same time, I don't think it's a given that you necessarily forgive the person who cheated on you. So Maggie has an uphill climb.\\" AfterEllen.com interview and Reese Williams Due to the continual fan support and demand for the pairing, Riegel and Hendrickson agreed to do a video blog interview with AfterEllen.com vlogger Bridget McManus on her show Brunch With Bridget, where they answered questions most queried by viewers and acted out desired scenes regarding the couple. The episode aired on May 4, 2008, and coincided with Hendrickson and Riegel's new web series Imaginary Bitches. McManus started off the interview asking the actresses how they felt about the writers having Maggie be unfaithful to Bianca. \\"I was totally upset about it. Are you kidding me?!\\" Riegel stated. \\"I was really surprised. But you know...Maggie's been confused, so it's not entirely surprising, but... I was...yeah... Those were hard scenes to do... We were both, like, genuinely upset,\\" she continued. Hendrickson had acknowledged her displeasure with the storyline in an earlier interview, and agreed. She also mentioned Maggie's sexual confusion. When asked about the emotional impact of Bianca and Maggie's scenes together, how the actresses cry on cue, Riegel cited their close friendship. \\"It's easy for me to cry around Lizzie because I have real feelings for her,\\" she said. \\"And I can imagine...'Oh, my god. This person that I love so much doesn't love me back.'\\" McManus mentioned some viewers thinking of Bianca and Maggie as real, alluding to their questions being addressed more so to the characters rather than the actresses. Riegel and Hendrickson found humor in the topic and agreed as McManus read a letter asking \\"Maggie\\" how she felt about her breakup with Bianca. This was followed by a query questioning whether Hendrickson receives hate mail for her character's cheating. \\"No, I don't get hate mail,\\" said Hendrickson. \\"Probably, I just never read it. But they just love me so much, they know that I'm not in control of what's written.\\" Since fans of the pairing often come up with \\"perfect scenarios\\" for the couple, Riegel and Hendrickson were asked if they had the opportunity to create their own storyline for the pairing, what would Bianca and Maggie be doing at the moment. Riegel replied, \\"Well, I think we'd be in bed together,\\" she said. McManus, however, questioned what Maggie and Frankie's parents might have thought about having two lesbian daughters. Hendrickson believed that they would have been proud. One fan had a series of questions for the actresses, asking: \\"It's obvious that you two have no issue playing gay or bisexual characters, so what is the biggest obstacle for you guys, obstacles to Bianca and Maggie being a couple in a relationship and seeing the relationship onscreen? And would you ever play gay again?\\" Riegel and Hendrickson said they would, and Hendrickson said they already \\"played gay again\\" earlier in the interview when the two acted out Bianca and Maggie's first meeting. Riegel said, \\"...Yes, to the second question, but the first question I don't know. It was very complicated.\\" Hendrickson said her only issue with the role was with the fact that the show would not let them use tongue during Bianca and Maggie's kissing scenes. There was a kissing scene that two of them \\"got so into\\", but the directors told them to \\"cut\\" and that they were \\"going to have to do it again because [they] saw tongue\\". McManus questioned whether heterosexual characters on the series show tongue. Hendrickson said, \\"Um, try m√©nage √† trois... In the shower. Or a man with a brother and sister... And a sister? God, no. Two brothers and one woman.... We had this lame little kiss, then cut to Kendall and, um, Ryan mauling each other,\\" she said. Riegel agreed with Hendrickson's assessment that the scene \\"literally\\" went from their kiss to the more detailed Ryan and Kendall's, and stated that it was as if Ryan was \\"devouring Kendall's face\\". Riegel said of heterosexual couples being given more passionate kisses than her lesbian romances, \\"...I think they're a couple of reasons. I don't think that you can necessarily say, you know, that they were scared of it...because I think they didn't want to turn people off because they wanted people to invest in the story. And they thought, 'Well, if we go too far...' Like, they were afraid that people who had -- who didn't know gay people, and this was very new to them... You know. So I think that was admirable. And I think as we went, we got more into it, and they let us kiss more and there was more whatever...\\" She cited a \\"nice kissing scene\\" between Bianca and Lena Kundera, and said that she remembered thinking why more scenes between gay/lesbian couples could not be like that, where it is \\"no big deal\\" and not heavily advertised. Hearing Lena's name brought resentment from Hendrickson, who felt that Lena \\"stole everything\\" from Maggie, such as the first lesbian kiss on an American soap opera and Bianca herself. Riegel said, despite this, that Maggie had won Bianca's heart. Riegel and Hendrickson acknowledged that some fans believe they are gay in real life. \\"Well, actually, one time I was in this big gay club right over in the area, and all of a sudden, apparently, I was in a serious relationship with a woman,\\" stated Hendrickson. Riegel was unaware of the rumor, and McManus questioned if it was the press that started it. Hendrickson clarified, \\"No, someone on the Internet was saying, 'Elizabeth was at -- and I saw her with a girl...and I was with Ally and we were just hanging out.'\\" Hendrickson found humor in this, saying that fans consistently speculate that she is gay based on the pictures she takes. She said that they make comments such as \\"Liz's pictures are always with her girlfriends\\", \\"she always has her leg around them\\", or \\"she's always, like, sexually with her girlfriends, maybe she's a lesbian\\". Hendrickson relayed her surprise, saying, \\"And I was like, I just like to take risque pictures. I'm just really horny. Sorry.\\" Riegel said, \\"She's not a lesbian. She's just non-discriminating.\\" Riegel and Hendrickson said their portrayals of gay characters has not harmed their acting careers, and has actually helped Hendrickson in acquiring new roles. The interview was concluded with a scene of Riegel and Hendrickson acting out Bianca and Maggie being reunited. Done for fans dissatisfied with the way the couple's story ended, the scenes included two kisses and other suggestive moments. Earlier in the interview, Riegel stated she liked to think of Bianca and Maggie living together back in Paris. On September 18, 2008, though fans still hoped for a Bianca and Maggie reunion, Bianca's return to the series without Maggie was reported. Hendrickson currently stars on The Young and the Restless as Chloe Mitchell, and Bianca was given a new female lover named Reese Williams. Riegel returned to the series on October 17, 2008. Tamara Braun was brought on as Reese Williams soon after. Riegel credited her comeback to her Internet series Imaginary Bitches. She said its All My Children viewers who also watch the web series forced her to establish that Bianca was needed back in Pine Valley. \\"It was then that I realized how much people wanted to see Bianca back,\\" she said, \\"how upset they were that Erica had been to prison and Bianca hadn't visited her. And they were angry at me! I was like, 'Wait a minute. I want to go back!'\\" Riegel felt that the show's writers and producers were not aware of her eagerness to return. So she \\"called up\\" Julie Hanan Carruthers, executive producer, and said, \\"Just so guys know, I would come back anytime, for as long as my schedule would allow. If you guys have an idea, call. I'm always, always here and always eager.\\" When Riegel returned from a trip to Europe, \\"there was a message from her saying, 'We've got something cooked up for you. Call us back'\\". Riegel stated that Carruthers \\"got [her] so excited\\" about the storyline, and that she was pleased to know she would be working with Braun. Reese Williams would allow Bianca the type of physical onscreen intimacy she had not had before on the series, and their romance would also include the first same-sex marriage proposal and wedding on an American soap opera. Hendrickson was not excited about the revelation. \\"[Hendrickson] is very jealous,\\" said Riegel. \\"I called her up and said, 'Okay, get this!' And she said, 'What? No!' I'd love for Maggie to come back, though, and have a catfight or something!\\" Riegel forewarned Bianca and Maggie fans that it is a fight Maggie would likely lose. \\"[Reese and Bianca are] a committed couple. They're in love,\\" she said. Riegel did, however, give Bianca and Maggie fans reason to believe that the two could be romantically reunited. When asked how she felt Bianca and Maggie fans would respond to the Reese and Bianca pairing, she said, \\"I'm pretty sure BAM fans will never be entirely satisfied until they have their two favorite girls together forever. But Lizzie's [Elizabeth Hendrickson] been so successful on Y&R; [as Chloe], and is so obviously happy there, I am hoping they are able to embrace this pairing for the time being.\\" She added, \\"Hey, at least she's a woman. And maybe sometime down the road the show would be able to entice Lizzie back for a visit to Pine Valley. I do have pull with the little munchkin. I bet I could get her to do it.\\" After significant criticism directed toward the Reese and Bianca romance, and the feeling that the writers no longer understood Bianca or what she was about, Riegel decided to permanently exit the role in 2010; she joined Hendrickson on The Young and the Restless soon after, as Heather Stevens. Criticism Bianca and Maggie's romance received criticism in addition to praise; there was a part of the audience that saw the romance as detrimental to both characters; they cited that it reinforced the notion that straight women can be \\"converted\\" by lesbians, or that lesbians and straight women cannot be friends without sex becoming an issue between them. The topic of what message All My Children was sending with the storyline was brought into question; whether it was a story about two women in a platonic relationship where one woman within the relationship fights the fact that she is gay and ends up with the woman she romantically desires, or about two women in a platonic relationship where the lesbian in the relationship waits long enough and the straight woman she romantically desires eventually becomes hers. Viewers had a need for the show to tell this controversial storyline responsibly. A significant portion of lesbian viewers, while watching Bianca and Maggie's dilemma, remembered how, in their own lives, they lost friendships, were subjected to acts of violence, and family estrangement because of the false belief that all gay/lesbian people are out to \\"turn\\" straight people to \\"their side\\" and are malicious in trying. There were a number of message board postings from people who were scared or angered by the possibility of a Bianca and Maggie romance due to the fact that it caused unpleasant memories to resurface for them in real life. It was addressed that it had not been that long for some gay men and lesbians that \\"they could walk out of a bar after a night of fun and dancing and not worry about who was watching them leave\\". Sentiment was expressed by Laura N. Cook of The Advocate that \\"despite assurances to the contrary, the show used Bianca's rape to marginalize Bianca's lover, Lena, and completely cut her out of Bianca's healing and recovery, while having Bianca's 'friend', Maggie, ponder her sexuality again, which added insult to injury\\".

The Democratic Party installment took place in Charleston, South Carolina and aired on July 23, 2007. The Republican Party installment took place in St. Petersburg, Florida and aired on November 28, 2007. History The CNN/YouTube Debates were conceived of by David Bohrman, the Washington Bureau Chief of CNN, and Steve Grove, the Head of News and Politics at YouTube. YouTube was a new platform on the political scene, rising to prominence in the 2006 midterm elections after Senator George Allen's Macaca Controversy, in which the Senator was captured calling his opponent Jim Webb's campaign worker a \\"Macaca\\" on video, which went viral on YouTube and damaged a campaign that narrowly lost at the polls. Media companies were looking for new ways to harness the possibilities of web video and YouTube was looking for opportunities to give its users access to the national political stage, so Bohrman and Grove formed a unique partnership in the CNN/YouTube Debates. It was the first-ever web-to-television debate partnership. Democratic debate right Introduction A man named Chris from Portland introduced the debate in a YouTube video. He challenged the candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Gravel, Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson and John Edwards) to \\"actually answer the questions\\" instead of \\"beating around the bush.\\" Moderator, Anderson Cooper, stepped in and discussed why many of the video questions were not selected, even showing the most popular video, made by YouTube celebrity Tony Huynh, better known as TheWineKone.. Retrieved May 14, 2012 After that, more video questions were shown and the candidates answered them. Questions Here are the video questions that were directed at each candidate. Sometimes, the questions were asked to one candidate, multiple candidates, or all candidates. Moderator Anderson Cooper opened questions directed at one candidate to specific additional candidates. Cooper also sometimes allowed candidates to respond if they were mentioned or addressed in another response. Questions for Senator Biden #If you had to pick any Republican member of Congress or Republican governor to be your running mate, who would it be? [Biden chose Richard Lugar or Chuck Hagel]. #Senator Biden, in the past, you've talked about NATO troops. What about American troops? (Anderson Cooper, Senator Gravel also had a response) #I have two questions. By what date after January 21, 2009, will all U.S. troops be out of Iraq? And how many family members do you have serving in uniform? #Who was your favorite teacher and why? (Sheena Currell, South Carolina) #Senator Biden, everyone on this stage who was in Congress in 2001 voted for No Child Left Behind. Would you scrap it or revise it? (Anderson Cooper) Questions for Senator Clinton #Mrs. Clinton, how would you define the word \\"liberal?\\" And would you use this word to describe yourself? (Rob Porter, Irvine, California) #Whenever I read an editorial about one of you, the author never fails to mention the issue of race or gender, respectively. Either one is not authentically black enough, or the other is not satisfactorily feminine. How will you address these critics and their charges if one or both of you should end up on the Democratic ticket in '08? (Jordan Williams, Coffeyville, Kansas) #Senator Clinton, is he [Edwards] a better advocate for women? (Anderson Cooper) #Should American troops go to Darfur? (Anderson Cooper) #Just in the spirit of trying to get the answer, does that mean no American ground troops? (Anderson Cooper) #Senator Clinton, do you think women should register for Selective Service? (Anderson Cooper) #This question is to Senator Hillary Clinton. The Arab states, Muslim nations, believe its women as being second-class citizens. If you're president of the United States, how do you feel that you would even be taken seriously by these states in any kind of talks, negotiations, or any other diplomatic relations? I feel that is a legitimate question. (John McAlpherin, Okinawa, Japan) #In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries? #With Bush, Clinton, and Bush again serving as the last three presidents, how would electing you, a Clinton, constitute the type of change in Washington so many people in the heartland are yearning for, and what your campaign has been talking about? I was also wondering if any of the other candidates had a problem with the same two families being in charge of the executive branch of government for 28 consecutive years, if Hillary Clinton were to potentially be elected and then re-elected. Questions for Senator Dodd #Senator Dodd, you've been in Congress more than 30 years. Can you honestly say you're any different? (Zack Kemph, Provo, Utah) #Do you believe the response in the wake of Hurricane Katrina would have been different if the storm hit an affluent, predominantly white city? What roles do you believe race and class played in the storm's aftermath? And if you acknowledge that race and class affected the response efforts, what can you do to ensure that this won't happen in the future? And what can you do to ensure this nation's most needy people, in times of crisis and always, something will be done to help them too? (Morgan G., Atlanta, Georgia) #If you were elected president of the United States, would you allow us to be married to each other? (Mary and Jen, Brooklyn, New York) #Should women register for selective service when they turn 18 like men do currently? (originally asked Tony Fuller, Wilson, Ohio) #I have two questions. By what date after January 21, 2009, will all U.S. troops be out of Iraq? And how many family members do you have serving in uniform? #So my question for you is, how is the United States going to decrease its energy consumption in the first place? In other words, how will your policies influence Americans, rather than just using special light bulbs, to do this? #We all know that Social Security is running out of money, but people who earn over $97,500 stop paying into Social Security. What is up with that? (Nancy McDonald, Wilmington, Delaware) Questions for Fmr. Senator Edwards #Senator Edwards? Any Republicans? (Anderson Cooper, goes along with the first question asked to Joe Biden) #Should African-Americans get reparations [for slavery]? (Will, Boston, Massachusetts) #Senator Edwards, earlier this week, your wife said that you would be a better advocate for women than Senator Clinton. Was she right? (Anderson Cooper) #Senator Edwards said his opposition to gay marriage is influenced by his Southern Baptist background. Most Americans agree it was wrong and unconstitutional to use religion to justify slavery, segregation, and denying women the right to vote. So why is it still acceptable to use religion to deny gay American their full and equal rights? (Reverend Reggie Longcrier, Hickory, North Carolina) #Senator Edwards, are the troops‚Äîdid the troops in Vietnam die in vain? (Anderson Cooper) #Senator Edwards? (Selective Service question, Anderson Cooper) #My question is, we here at Planned Parenthood support comprehensive sex education and I'd like to know if any of you as candidates have talked to your children about sex and used medically accurate and age-appropriate information? (Anne, Pennsylvania) Questions for Fmr. Senator Gravel #Senator Gravel, are you a liberal? (Anderson Cooper) #My question is for Mike Gravel. In one of the previous debates you said something along the lines of the entire deaths of Vietnam died in vain. How do you expect to win in a country where probably a pretty large chunk of the people voting disagree with that statement and might very well be offended by it? I'd like to know if you plan to defend that statement, or if you're just going to flip-flop. Thanks. (Don, West Virginia) #Senator Gravel? (Selective Service question, Anderson Cooper) #Who was your favorite teacher and why? (Sheena Currell, South Carolina) #So my question for you is, how is the United States going to decrease its energy consumption in the first place? In other words, how will your policies influence Americans, rather than just using special light bulbs, to do this? #Do you have a problem with it (Democratic Party)?

And how many family members do you have serving in uniform? #As president, what will you do to ensure that my son will live a full and happy life? This video question features an anthropomorphic snowman. #And I'd like to know, if the Democrats come into office, are my taxes going to rise like usually they do when a Democrats gets into office? (Marcus Benson, Minneapolis, Minnesota) Questions for Senator Obama #Senator Obama, your position on reparations [for slavery]? #Whenever I read an editorial about one of you, the author never fails to mention the issue of race or gender, respectively.

How will you address these critics and their charges if one or both of you should end up on the Democratic ticket in '08? (Jordan Williams, Coffeyville, Kansas) #Senator Obama, the laws banning interracial marriage in the United States were ruled unconstitutional in 1967. What is the difference between a ban on interracial marriage and a ban on gay marriage? (Anderson Cooper) #Senator Obama, are the soldiers dying in Iraq in vain? (Anderson Cooper) #To the question of, did the troops‚Äîare the troops dying in vain, though: Yes or no? (Anderson Cooper) #Senator Obama, should women register for Selective Service? (Anderson Cooper) #In 1982, Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since. In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries? #Who was your favorite teacher and why? (Sheena Currell, South Carolina) #Senator Obama, Mitt Romney has accused you this week of saying that 5-year-old children should be getting sex education. Was he right?

(Anderson Cooper) #Governor Richardson, you have had to implement No Child Left Behind in your state. Would you scrap it? Revise it? (Anderson Cooper) #There are two solutions, both of which are politically unpopular: Raise taxes or cut benefits. Which would you choose, and how would you convince the public to support you? Questions for all the candidates #My question for all the candidates: How do we pull out now? And the follow-up, are we watching the same blankin' war? I certainly wasn't a big fan of the invasion/liberation. It sickens me to hear about soldiers wounded and getting killed daily, not to mention innocent Iraqis, but how do we pull out now? The government's shaky; bombs daily. Don't you think if we pulled out now that would open it up for Iran and Syria, God knows who‚ÄîRussia‚Äîhow do we pull out now? And isn't it our responsibility to get these people up on their feet? I mean, do you leave a newborn baby to take care of himself? How do we pull out now? (Bary Mitchell, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) #Hey, I'm Mike Green from Lexington, South Carolina. And I was wanting to ask all the nominees whether they would send their kids to public school or private school. #This here question's for all you candidates. Mainstream media seems awfully interested in old Al Gore these days. Is he losing weight? What's it say in his book? Is he still worried about all the ice? They interpret all these as signs that he may or may not run. They really want to know if Al Gore's going to run again. Yes. Well, what we want to know is does that hurt you-all's feelings? (Jackie Broyles and \\"Dunlap\\" of Red State Update, Murfreesboro, Tennessee) #How many people here have a private jet or a chartered jet to get here tonight? (Anderson Cooper) #There is a scientific consensus for man-caused climate change, and I've heard each of you talk in previous debates about alternative energy sources like solar or wind, but I have not heard any of you speak your opinion on nuclear power. I believe that nuclear power is safer, cleaner, and provides a quicker avenue to energy independence than other alternatives. I am curious what each of you believe. (Shawn, Ann Arbor, Michigan) #Don't you think that standardizing our voting practices will increase legitimacy, and possibly even voter turnout in our elections? What are you going to do to fix that? (Mellisa, San Luis Obispo, California) #My question to the candidates: If you're elected to serve, would you be willing to do this service for the next four years and be paid the national minimum wage? (Cecilla Smith and Asanti Wilkins, Pennsylvania) #My taxes put some kids in college I can't afford to send myself. Now, tell me, if you were elected president, what would you do to help? #What are you prepared to do to fight this disease (Alzheimer's disease) now? #What I'd like to know is, how do each of you plan on addressing chronic disease and preventative health in your health care plans? I would like my mother to be around to see her grandchildren. #What would you as president do to make low-cost or free preventive medicine available for everybody in this country? Thank you. #To all the candidates, tell me your position on gun control, as myself and other Americans really want to know if our babies are safe. This is my baby, purchased under the 1994 gun ban. Please tell me your views. Thank you. (Jered Townsend, Clio, Michigan) #What's to like and dislike about the candidate to your left? (Jason Koop, Colorado Springs, Colorado) Post-debate Reaction After the debate ended, CNN interviewed their focus groups, and they thought that Barack Obama was the candidate who most understood their issues. Ratings In an article published by Reuters, Nielsen Media Research indicated that the Democratic debate delivered the highest Nielsen ratings of any debate broadcast on a cable news network among adults 18-34. The debate had an average of 2.6 million viewers, which makes it the second-most-watched debate of the 2007 television season. The Manchester, New Hampshire Democratic Debate that was held on June 3, 2007 received 2.8 million viewers. Clinton and Obama controversy Senator Clinton and Senator Obama quarreled with one another in post-debate memos over whether it would be suitable for them to meet with world leaders considered by some hostile to the U.S., among them Fidel Castro, Kim Jong-il, and Hugo Chavez. A memo issued by a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign spokesman stated that Obama said he would meet with some of the world's worst dictators during his first year of office without preconditions. Obama's campaign said that Obama's method \\"is exactly the kind of change and new thinking that excites voters about an Obama presidency.\\" The two candidates also argued over who won the overall debate. On July 26, 2007, in a speech made in Concord, New Hampshire, Senator Obama stated that he did not want \\"Bush‚ÄìCheney Lite,\\" referring to Senator Clinton. Criticism Media following the event expressed mixed feelings about whether or not the questions were 'tough' or pertinent enough. Some analysts expressed criticism of the candidates responses, and the format itself pointing to the lack of follow up questions. During the debate, presidential candidate Mike Gravel questioned whether the debate was \\"fair\\" or not and complained due to a lack of airtime. In a Newsweek article written by Brian Braiker, he indicated that many YouTube users would have preferred that CNN select the most popular video questions. Republican debate The CNN/YouTube Republican Debate on 2007-11-28 Introduction Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer introduced the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist. The governor then gave a brief introduction before turning the debate over to moderator Anderson Cooper. Questions #This is Ernie Nardi from Dyker Heights in Brooklyn, New York, with a question for the ex-Mayor Giuliani. Under your administration, as well as others, New York City was operated as a sanctuary city, aiding and abetting illegal aliens. I would like to know, if you become president of the United States, will you continue to aid and abett the flight of illegal aliens into this country? #Good evening. There are thousands of people in Canada and Mexico waiting to come to America legally. They want to become American citizens. They want to be part of the American dream. Yet, there are those in the Senate that want to grant amnesty for those that come here illegally. Will you pledge tonight, if elected president, to veto any immigration bill that involves amnesty for those that have come here illegally? Thank you. #Hammered by competition with imports, our family-owned business struggles each year to find seasonal workers. We've been working with a seasonal guest worker program, the H-2B program, bringing in and sending home workers every year. But with Congress failing to enact a comprehensive immigration and guest worker bill, I want to know whether I'll have a job next year. What are you going to do to keep these guest workers coming to the U.S. to save our business? #Governor Huckabee, while governor of Arkansas, you gave an illegal aliens a discount for college in Arkansas by allow them to pay lower in-state tuition rates. However, we have thousands of military members currently serving our country in Iraq with children at home. If these children chose to move to Arkansas to attend college, they would have to pay three times the tuition rate that illegal aliens pay. Would you support a federal law which would require any state that gives these tuition rates to illegal aliens to give the same rates to the children of our military members? #Good evening, candidates. This is Seekster from Arlington, Texas, and this question is for Ron Paul. I've met a lot of your supporters online, but I've noticed that a good number of them seem to buy into this conspiracy theory regarding the Council of Foreign Relations, and some plan to make a North American union by merging the United States with Canada and Mexico. These supporters of yours seem to think that you also believe in this theory. So my question to you is: Do you really believe in all this, or are people just putting words in your mouth? #Hi, I am Emily and I am from Los Angeles. The Republican Party once stood for limited government, which meant reduce federal spending because it cost less and we spent less. However, over the past decade, real discretionary federal spending has in fact increased 40 percent, more than half of which has been non-defense related. So my question is: What are the names of the top three federal programs you would reduce in size in order to decrease... #My name is Ronald Lanham from Mobile, Alabama. And I want you to tell me, do you support the elimination of the federal income tax in favor of a national retail sales tax, also known as the fair tax? Thank you. #President Bush made a commitment when he ran for president in 2000 and 2004 that he would oppose and veto any tax increase that Congress sent him. My question to each of the candidates is: Would you promise to the people watching this right now, that you will oppose and veto any efforts to raise taxes as long as you're president? #Hi, I'm Ted Faturos from Manhattan Beach, California. mmmm, nothing says delicious like cheap corn subsidized by the American taxpayer. For a lot of Americans, however, a bitter taste is left in their mouth when they learned about how the U.S. taxpayer bankrolls billions of dollars in farm subsidies that mostly go to large item business interests. I'm curious which candidate could label themselves fiscally responsible, will endorse the elimination of farm subsidies if they are elected president in 2008. #My name is LeeAnn Anderson and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and these are my kids Evan and May. Maya is from China and we adopted him to give her a better life. We never dreamed that she would that she'd be exposed to lead after leaving China, and now we find trains like this that are covered with lead in our home. My question for the candidates are, what are you going to do to make sure that these kind of toys don't make their way into our homes and that we have safe toys that are made in America again and we keep jobs in America? #I'm Jay Fox, lifetime member of the NRA. Now, I am from a small town and as in any small town, we like our big guns. My question to you is: What is your opinion of gun control? And don't worry (cocks rifle), you can answer however you like. #Hello. My name is Andrew Fink, and I have a question for Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, at a recent NRA convention, you stated that it's every American's right to be secure. Yet, on March 21 of the year 2000, The Boston Globe quoted you as saying, \\"Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam.\\" Considering the Constitution grants us the right to bear arms as a means of protection, why do you believe that citizens should be required to pass an exam in order to exercise their right to protect themselves and their families? Thank you. #Hi there. I'm Eric Berntson from Phoenix, Arizona. Got a quick question for all you candidates. Any of you all want to tell us about your gun collection, roughly how many you own, what your favorite make, model and caliber is, if any of them require a tax stamp? #Hi, this is me and my son Prentiss. We're from Atlanta. I want to ask you guys a question (inaudible) every year. But what about the war going on in our country, black on black crime? Two hundred to 400 black men die yearly in one city alone. What are you going to do about that war? It feels like the Taliban is right outside. #Hi. My name is Journey. I'm from Texas. And this question is for all (inaudible) pro-life candidates. In the event that abortion becomes illegal and a woman obtains an abortion anyway, what should she be charged with, and what should her punishment be? What about the doctor who performs the abortion? #Hi. This is Tyler Overman from Memphis, Tennessee. And I have a quick question for those of you who would call yourselves Christian conservatives. The death penalty, what would Jesus do? #I am Joseph. I am from Dallas, Texas, and how you answer this question will tell us everything we need to know about you. Do you believe every word of this book? [Shows a copy of the King James Bible to the camera.] Specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand, do you believe this book? #Good evening, gentlemen. My name is Yasmin and I hail from Huntsville, Alabama. My question has to do with the current crisis in Iraq, as well as the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. After living abroad, personally, in the Middle East for a year, I realized just how much damage the Iraq war and the perception of invasion has done to the image of America. What would you do as president to repair the image of America in the eyes of the Muslim world? #Hello, gentlemen. I'm Andrew, and I'm a college student from Seattle, Washington. Recently, Senator McCain has come out strongly against using waterboarding as an instrument of interrogation. My question for the rest of you is, considering that Mr. McCain is the only one with any firsthand knowledge on the subject, how can those of you sharing the stage with him disagree with his position? #Hello. My name is Buzz Brockway from Lawrenceville, Georgia. All the talk about the war in Iraq centers around how quickly we can get out. I think that's the wrong question. We need to make a permanent or long-term military commitment to the region. By staying in Iraq, we provide long-term stability to the region, we provide support for our allies, and we act as a deterrent to the trouble-makers in the region. Which presidential candidate will make a permanent of long-term military commitment to the people of Iraq? Thank you. #Hi. My name is Sam Garcia. I'm from Colorado Springs, Colorado. The following question is for Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, a while back, a friend and I were having a discussion about you and some of the other Republican candidates. He blatantly made this statement somewhere along the line: Rudy Giuliani is using September 11, 2001, to propel himself into the White House. My question to you is: How do you respond to this accusation and other accusations similar to it? #Yes. Will you grant your vice president as much power and influence as I've had? And remember, before you answer, I'm watching you. #My name's Keith Kerr, from Santa Rosa, California. I'm a retired brigadier general with 43 years of service. And I'm a graduate of the Special Forces Officer Course, the Commanding General Staff Course and the Army War College. And I'm an openly gay man. I want to know why you think that American men and women in uniform are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians. #Hi, my name is David Cercone. I'd like to ask all the candidates if they accept the support of the Log Cabin Republicans, and why should the Log Cabin Republicans support their candidacy? #This is Adam Florzak of Illinois. The national debt is now growing so quickly it will have increased by over half- million dollars in just the time it takes to ask this question. Over the years, politicians have borrowed just under $2 trillion from the Social Security trust fund to cover these massive budget deficits, and now the retirements of our generation are at risk. What will you do as president to help repay this money and restore the trust? #My name is Steve Nielson. And this question comes to you from Denver, Colorado. JFK's vision put a man on the moon from a nonexistent space program in about seven years. The new vision for space exploration has provided about 15 years for that same feat. Meanwhile, Congress is pulling funding for human-to-Mars research altogether. Is there a candidate amongst you willing to take a pledge on behalf of the Mars Society of sending an American to the surface of Mars by 2020? If not, what is your vision for human space exploration? #Hi, my name is David McMillan, and I'm from Los Angeles, California. On a variety of specific issues -- gay marriage, taxes, the death penalty, immigration, faith-based initiatives, school vouchers, school prayer‚Äîmany African Americans hold fairly conservative views. And yet, we overwhelmingly vote Democrat in most elections. So my question to any of the Republican candidates here is, why don't we vote for you? #Hello, my name is Leroy Brooks. I am from Houston, Texas and my question is for all the candidates. Whether this flag right here [points to a Confederate flag] represents the symbol of racism, a symbol of political ideology, a symbol of Southern heritage‚Äîor, is it something completely different? #Good evening. My name is Dr. Hank Campbell. I'm in Lake Worth, Florida. My question is our infrastructure. It's been estimated that to fix the bridges, the tunnels, the power grids, the water delivery systems in this country will be in excess of $2 trillion‚Äîthat is \\"t\\" for \\"trillion\\"‚Äîand it is plural. Who among the candidates here is willing to step forward and begin to articulate the very difficult sacrifices which we need to make in order to start repairing America? Thank you. #Mark Strauss, Davenport, Iowa. This question is for Ron Paul. Mr. Paul, I think we both know that the Republican party is never going to give you the nomination. But I'm hoping that you're crazy like a fox like that and you're using this exposure to propel yourself into an independent run. My question is for Ron Paul: Mr. Paul, are you going to let America down by not running as an independent? Thank you. #Giuliani, can you explain why you being a lifelong Yankees fan, that this year, after the Yankees lost everything, you rooted for the Red Sox in the postseason? Can you explain that position for me? Controversy about CNN's choice of questions Soon after the debate several bloggers discovered that several questions to Republicans were asked by Democratic supporters, not by undecided voters, with some bloggers and commentators alleging that CNN purposely arranged this to embarrass Republican candidates.Black Eye for CNN, Anderson Cooper and Google .

It first saw action in 1947. History An aerial view of the Killarney Race Track with Table Mountain visible in the distance In 1959/60 the track was upgraded and rebuilt to conform to the required FIA standard for the 1500 cc Formula One cars of the time. The design was entrusted to Edgar Hoal, a leading racing driver and roads engineer, who also supervised its construction. The Western Cape then had its first taste of international Formula One racing when the non-championship Cape Grand Prix was held at Killarney on 17 December 1960, and was won by Stirling Moss in a Porsche. Since then the complex has grown to include every facet of circuit motorsport. So much so that Killarney currently hosts all forms of main circuit racing, as well as motocross, karting, super motards, stock car, drag racing and European Truck Racing as a one off event. The circuit will host the first FIA World Championship race in South Africa since the 1990s with the inaugural World RX of South Africa to be held in 2017 for the FIA World Rallycross Championship. Track features The main track has the unusual feature of having two pit lanes on the home stretch. The racing complex also has a drag racing strip and a go-kart track. Additionally, turn 9 can be turned into a proper chicane for the purposes of motorcycle races. For the World RX of South Africa, the northwestern portion of the circuit was used, with an extra dirt road added to its infield.

The stage name \\"Tomu\\" translates to ‚Äúspit out dreams‚Äù. Early career Uchida started out at the Taikatsu studio in the early 1920s, but came to prominence at Nikkatsu, adapting literary works with the screenwriter Yasutar≈ç Yagi in a realist style. His 1929 film A Living Puppet (Ikeru ningyo) was selected as the fourth best film of the year by the film journal, Kinema Junpo. Many of his 1930s films featured the actor Isamu Kosugi. One such work, Policeman (Keisatsukan), has been called \\"a tremendously stylish gangster movie about the love-hate relationship between a cop and a criminal, once childhood friends\\". It is Uchida‚Äôs only surviving complete silent film. Uchida borrows from Hollywood gangster films and expressionist techniques in a story of a young policeman tracking down an old friend who is now a criminal. His work from the 1920 and 1930s possess a leftist social commentary and were often some of the most critically acclaimed films of the time. Kinema Junpo selected Jinsei Gekijo as the number two film of 1936, Kagirinaki Zenshin as the best film of 1937, and Tsuchi as the best film of 1939. The latter was praised for its realistic depiction of the lives of poor Meiji-period tenant farmers. Unfortunately, few of Uchida's prewar works survive in their entirety. In 1941, Uchida quit the Nikkatsu studio, and after failing to start his own production company, in 1943 began to work with the Manchukuo Film Association, although he never completed a film there. In 1945 he was taken prisoner and held in Manchuria until 1954, when he returned to Japan. Postwar career Upon he return, he joined the Toei studio. His post-war movies reveal a strong genre stylist with no immediately discernible themes, much like many golden- age Hollywood directors. Uchida effortlessly directed chamber dramas, comedies, and samurai epics, often in color, and with a forward-looking dose of irony. His first film after returning, Bloody Spear at Mount Fuji (Chiyari Fuji) (1955), was an adventure about a samurai and his servant on a trip to Edo. In a sly bit of subversion, the peasants are more intelligent than the drunken samurai. The final battle in a courtyard amidst punctured sake barrels is considered a highlight of Uchida's career. According to the critic Craig Watts, ‚ÄúBoth progressive and nostalgic, humanistic and nationalistic, peaceful and violent, Blood Spear, Mt. Fuji, like the Japanese experience in Manchuria, is an aggressive conglomeration of extremes.\\" In Twilight Saloon (Tasogare Sakaba) (1955), which dealt with post-war fears in a lighter tone than A Hole of My Own Making, Uchida views a cross-section of Japanese life over the course of one night in a tavern. Dancers take the stage, a singing contest is held, and old soldiers reminisce. At the corner of the bar is an artist drowning himself in drink, who acts as the film‚Äôs narrator (and Uchida‚Äôs alter ego) in this gently humorous film. The journal Cinema Scope said that, ‚ÄúResembling a poetic-realist version of Casablanca (1942), the film is a naturalistic tour de force.‚Äù The Outsiders (Mori to Mizuumi no Matsuri) (1958) was one of Uchida‚Äôs most socially conscious films. It looks at the Ainu, an indigenous people who live on the island of Hokkaido and were often portrayed as vicious savages (much like Native Americans in Westerns). As the hero of the film challenges an owner to prove his own Ainu heritage, the film raises questions about the necessity of preserving a culture. In the words of the critic Jasper Sharp: ‚ÄúBold, beautiful, and packing a powerful dramatic punch, there is little else quite like it.‚Äù In The Master Spearman (Sake To Onna To Yari) (1960) a shogun kills himself, and rituals dictate that his samurai must also commit seppuku; however one young ronin refuses to follow this code and retreats to the country, only to be lured back into the service of the spear. Uchida gently tweaks audience expectations, as a character bemoans a crowd‚Äôs blood-lust, only to reward them with a violent ending. Many of Uchida's postwar works were engaged less in social realism than in cinematic experimentation. Experimenting with incorporating kabuki and bunraku puppets Chikamatsu‚Äôs Love in Osaka (Naniwa No Koi No Monogatari) (1959) followed a young man who falls in love with a prostitute, vowing to rescue her from the brothel. Not content with adapting the play, Uchida made the playwright Chikamatsu a character in the drama who moves from observer to narrator to participant as the tragedy unfolds in somewhat postmodern fashion. That film ended up number seven on Kinema Junpo's best ten list. Hero of the Red-Light District (Yoto Monogatari: Hana No Yoshiwara Hyakunin Giri) (1960), about a wealthy businessman with a disfigured face who seems unable to find love until he meets a conniving prostitute out to win his fortune, features a violent end in a shower of cherry blossoms. To Alexander Jacoby, ‚ÄúThe violent climax is, once again, directed with breathtaking assurance; it is, in fact, perhaps the single most brilliant scene in Uchida‚Äôs oeuvre.‚Äù The Mad Fox (Koi Ya Koi Nasuna Koi) (1962) was a full-on avant-garde classic that mixed kabuki and animation with location and studio work. A man tormented by the death of his wife meets her twin sister and a fox spirit who takes the form of his beloved. The story was just an excuse for Uchida to challenge the form and function of cinema in a tribute to Japanese folk tales. Toronto's Now Magazine declared that it was one of the weirdest films in any language....Torture, murder and possible bestiality‚Äîis only the beginning of this hallucinatory fairy tale‚Äôs trippy charm.‚Äù A Fugitive from the Past (Kiga Kaikyo) (1965) is considered his masterpiece. Adapted from the novel Kiga Kaikyo (1962) by Tsutomu Minakami and often compared to Kurosawa's High and Low (1963), this examination of criminal life in post-war Japan is split into three sections: the criminal on the run, an interlude with a prostitute, and the final confrontation with police. The grainy widescreen cinematography results from Uchida‚Äôs unusual choice to shoot in 16mm and blow up to 35mm. It was voted the sixth greatest Japanese film ever made by Kinema Jumpo in 1995, and the third greatest Japanese film in the same magazine in 1999. Uchida died in 1970 of cancer.

As in other areas of mathematics, such problems are often made public at professional conferences and meetings. Problems posed here appeared in, for instance, the Loops (Prague) conferences and the Milehigh (Denver) conferences.  Open problems   Bounds on maximal number of transversals in a Latin square  > A transversal in a Latin square of order n is a set S of n cells such that > every row and every column contains exactly one cell of S, and such that the > symbols in S form {1, ..., n}. Let T(n) be the maximum number of > transversals in a Latin square of order n. Estimate T(n). *Proposed: by Ian Wanless at Loops '03, Prague 2003 *Comments: Wanless, McKay and McLeod have bounds of the form cn < T(n) < dn n!, where c > 1 and d is about 0.6. A conjecture by Rivin, Vardi and Zimmermann (Rivin et al., 1994) says that you can place at least exp(c n log n) queens in non-attacking positions on a toroidal chessboard (for some constant c). If true this would imply that T(n) > exp(c n log n). A related question is to estimate the number of transversals in the Cayley tables of cyclic groups of odd order. In other words, how many orthomorphisms do these groups have? :The minimum number of transversals of a Latin square is also an open problem. H. J. Ryser conjectured (Oberwolfach, 1967) that every Latin square of odd order has one. Closely related is the conjecture, attributed to Richard Brualdi, that every Latin square of order n has a partial transversal of order at least n ‚àí 1\\\\.

This immediately gives a linear number of factors of 2. However, here are the prime factorizations of R_n for n = 2, ...,11: {  - ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9 ! 10 ! 11 -  1  1  22  237  26*3*72  210*3*5*1103  217*3*1361291  221*32*5231*3824477  228*32*5*31*37*547135293937  235*34*5*2801*2206499*62368028479 } :This table suggests that the power of 2 is growing superlinearly. The best current result is that R_n is always divisible by f!, where f is about n/2. See (McKay and Wanless, 2003).

She was of Spanish, French and Nicaraguan descent. Her grandfather was Dr. Luis Henri DeBayle Pallais, and married to Casimira Sacasa Sacasa. He was a good friend of Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Her maternal great- grandfather was Roberto Sacasa Sarria, former President of Nicaragua. The DeBayles and Portocarreros were among Nicaragua's wealthiest families. She spoke fluent English, Italian, Spanish, and French and had an appreciation for art and culture. After 1943, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she often spent time with her cousin Lillian Sevilla-Sacasa (n√©e Somoza). She attended Barnard College of Columbia University and was in the class of 1950. Portocarrero spent the summer of 1949 traveling in Europe accompanied by her mother. Marriage Portocarrero and her cousin Anastasio Somoza Debayle were married on 10 December 1950 in Managua's Cathedral by Archbishop Jos√© Antonio Lezcano. Over 4,000 guests attended the ceremony. The reception was given by her father-in-law, President Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, in the luxurious and modern Palacio de Comunicaciones. The couple traveled to South America for their honeymoon. The Somozas had five children: Anastasio, Julio, Carolina, Carla, and Roberto Somoza Portocarrero. Her daughter, Carolina, is married to James Minskoff Sterling, son of New York real estate developer Henry H. Minskoff and his wife.\\"Miss Somoza Wed to Dr. J. M. Sterling\\", New York Times, October 16, 1984 First Lady of Nicaragua When her husband became president of Nicaragua in 1967, Portocarrero became the First Lady. She was covered in the media for her fashionable wardrobe. During her husband's time in office, she served as a hostess for many state visits, among them U.S. President Richard Nixon and Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Somoza was also president of the ' (National Social Security). She created the National Cultural Center, the General Archives of the National Library, National Conservatory of Music, National School of Fine Arts (Bellas Artes), National Museum, and Plurar Gallery. Her biggest legacies were the construction of Teatro Nacional Rub√©n Dar√≠o (The National Theater of Nicaragua), the Children's Hospital, a clinic for Nicaraguan women, and a Center for Orphans, known as \\"The Hope\\". Final years Due to continuing marital strife, her husband Anastasio began a relationship with a mistress, Dinorah Sampson. Portocarrero later relocated to London. Since the couple were Catholic, she never divorced Somoza. A year after he died, she married Archie Baldocchi, a wealthy American businessman. She died of cancer in Miami, Florida on 5 October 1991.

Dirac, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th edition, Clarendon, Oxford UK, (1958) p. 248) is a linear operator that makes a wave function of N identical fermions antisymmetric under the exchange of the coordinates of any pair of fermions. After application of \\\\mathcal{A} the wave function satisfies the Pauli exclusion principle. Since \\\\mathcal{A} is a projection operator, application of the antisymmetrizer to a wave function that is already totally antisymmetric has no effect, acting as the identity operator. Mathematical definition  Consider a wave function depending on the space and spin coordinates of N fermions: : \\\\Psi(1,2, \\\\ldots, N)\\\\quad\\\\text{with} \\\\quad i \\\\leftrightarrow (\\\\mathbf{r}_i, \\\\sigma_i), where the position vector ri of particle i is a vector in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 and œÉi takes on 2s+1 values, where s is the half-integral intrinsic spin of the fermion. For electrons s = 1/2 and œÉ can have two values (\\"spin-up\\": 1/2 and \\"spin- down\\": ‚àí1/2). It is assumed that the positions of the coordinates in the notation for Œ® have a well-defined meaning. For instance, the 2-fermion function Œ®(1,2) will in general be not the same as Œ®(2,1). This implies that in general \\\\Psi(1,2)- \\\\Psi(2,1) e 0 and therefore we can define meaningfully a transposition operator \\\\hat{P}_{ij} that interchanges the coordinates of particle i and j. In general this operator will not be equal to the identity operator (although in special cases it may be). A transposition has the parity (also known as signature) ‚àí1\\\\. The Pauli principle postulates that a wave function of identical fermions must be an eigenfunction of a transposition operator with its parity as eigenvalue : \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{P}_{ij} \\\\Psi\\\\big(1,2,\\\\ldots,i, \\\\ldots,j,\\\\ldots, N\\\\big)& \\\\equiv \\\\Psi\\\\big(\\\\pi(1),\\\\pi(2),\\\\ldots,\\\\pi(i), \\\\ldots,\\\\pi(j),\\\\ldots, \\\\pi(N)\\\\big) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\equiv \\\\Psi(1,2,\\\\ldots,j, \\\\ldots,i,\\\\ldots, N) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= - \\\\Psi(1,2,\\\\ldots,i, \\\\ldots,j,\\\\ldots, N). \\\\end{align} Here we associated the transposition operator \\\\hat{P}_{ij} with the permutation of coordinates œÄ that acts on the set of N coordinates. In this case œÄ = (ij), where (ij) is the cycle notation for the transposition of the coordinates of particle i and j. Transpositions may be composed (applied in sequence). This defines a product between the transpositions that is associative. It can be shown that an arbitrary permutation of N objects can be written as a product of transpositions and that the number of transposition in this decomposition is of fixed parity. That is, either a permutation is always decomposed in an even number of transpositions (the permutation is called even and has the parity +1), or a permutation is always decomposed in an odd number of transpositions and then it is an odd permutation with parity ‚àí1\\\\. Denoting the parity of an arbitrary permutation œÄ by (‚àí1)œÄ, it follows that an antisymmetric wave function satisfies : \\\\hat{P} \\\\Psi\\\\big(1,2,\\\\ldots, N\\\\big) \\\\equiv \\\\Psi\\\\big(\\\\pi(1),\\\\pi(2),\\\\ldots, \\\\pi(N)\\\\big) = (-1)^\\\\pi \\\\Psi(1,2,\\\\ldots, N), where we associated the linear operator \\\\hat{P} with the permutation œÄ. The set of all N! permutations with the associative product: \\"apply one permutation after the other\\", is a group, known as the permutation group or symmetric group, denoted by SN. We define the antisymmetrizer as : \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{N!} \\\\sum_{P \\\\in S_N} (-1)^\\\\pi \\\\hat{P} . Properties of the antisymmetrizer  In the representation theory of finite groups the antisymmetrizer is a well-known object, because the set of parities \\\\\\\\{ (-1)^\\\\pi \\\\\\\\} forms a one-dimensional (and hence irreducible) representation of the permutation group known as the antisymmetric representation. The representation being one-dimensional, the set of parities form the character of the antisymmetric representation. The antisymmetrizer is in fact a character projection operator and is quasi-idempotent, : This has the consequence that for any N-particle wave function Œ®(1, ...,N) we have : \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\Psi(1,\\\\ldots, N) = \\\\begin{cases} &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Psi'(1,\\\\dots, N) e 0. \\\\end{cases} Either Œ® does not have an antisymmetric component, and then the antisymmetrizer projects onto zero, or it has one and then the antisymmetrizer projects out this antisymmetric component Œ®'. The antisymmetrizer carries a left and a right representation of the group: : \\\\hat{P} \\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\hat{P} = (-1)^\\\\pi \\\\mathcal{A},\\\\qquad \\\\forall \\\\pi \\\\in S_N, with the operator \\\\hat{P} representing the coordinate permutation œÄ. Now it holds, for any N-particle wave function Œ®(1, ...,N) with a non-vanishing antisymmetric component, that : \\\\hat{P} \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\Psi(1,\\\\ldots, N) \\\\equiv \\\\hat{P} \\\\Psi'(1,\\\\ldots, N)=(-1)^\\\\pi \\\\Psi'(1,\\\\ldots, N), showing that the non- vanishing component is indeed antisymmetric. If a wave function is symmetric under any odd parity permutation it has no antisymmetric component. Indeed, assume that the permutation œÄ, represented by the operator \\\\hat{P}, has odd parity and that Œ® is symmetric, then : \\\\hat{P} \\\\Psi = \\\\Psi \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\hat{P} \\\\Psi = \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\Psi \\\\Longrightarrow -\\\\mathcal{A} \\\\Psi = \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\Psi \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\Psi = 0. As an example of an application of this result, we assume that Œ® is a spin-orbital product. Assume further that a spin-orbital occurs twice (is \\"doubly occupied\\") in this product, once with coordinate k and once with coordinate q. Then the product is symmetric under the transposition (k, q) and hence vanishes. Notice that this result gives the original formulation of the Pauli principle: no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers (be in the same spin- orbital). Permutations of identical particles are unitary, (the Hermitian adjoint is equal to the inverse of the operator), and since œÄ and œÄ‚àí1 have the same parity, it follows that the antisymmetrizer is Hermitian, : \\\\mathcal{A}^\\\\dagger = \\\\mathcal{A}. The antisymmetrizer commutes with any observable \\\\hat{H}\\\\, (Hermitian operator corresponding to a physical-- observable--quantity) : [\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\hat{H}] = 0. If it were otherwise, measurement of \\\\hat{H}\\\\, could distinguish the particles, in contradiction with the assumption that only the coordinates of indistinguishable particles are affected by the antisymmetrizer. Connection with Slater determinant In the special case that the wave function to be antisymmetrized is a product of spin-orbitals : \\\\Psi(1,2, \\\\ldots, N) = \\\\psi_{n_1}(1) \\\\psi_{n_2}(2) \\\\cdots \\\\psi_{n_N}(N) the Slater determinant is created by the antisymmetrizer operating on the product of spin-orbitals, as below: : \\\\sqrt{N!}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\Psi(1,2, \\\\ldots, N) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N!}} \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\psi_{n_1}(1) & \\\\psi_{n_1}(2) & \\\\cdots & \\\\psi_{n_1}(N) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{n_2}(1) & \\\\psi_{n_2}(2) & \\\\cdots & \\\\psi_{n_2}(N) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{n_N}(1) & \\\\psi_{n_N}(2) & \\\\cdots & \\\\psi_{n_N}(N) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{vmatrix} The correspondence follows immediately from the Leibniz formula for determinants, which reads : \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{B}) = \\\\sum_{\\\\pi \\\\in S_N} (-1)^\\\\pi B_{1,\\\\pi(1)}\\\\cdot B_{2,\\\\pi(2)}\\\\cdot B_{3,\\\\pi(3)}\\\\cdot\\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,\\\\cdot B_{N,\\\\pi(N)}, where B is the matrix : \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} B_{1,1} & B_{1,2} & \\\\cdots & B_{1,N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{2,1} & B_{2,2} & \\\\cdots & B_{2,N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{N,1} & B_{N,2} & \\\\cdots & B_{N,N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. To see the correspondence we notice that the fermion labels, permuted by the terms in the antisymmetrizer, label different columns (are second indices). The first indices are orbital indices, n1, ..., nN labeling the rows. Example By the definition of the antisymmetrizer : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\psi_a(1)\\\\psi_b(2)\\\\psi_c(3) = & \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\Big( \\\\psi_a(1)\\\\psi_b(2)\\\\psi_c(3) + \\\\psi_a(3)\\\\psi_b(1)\\\\psi_c(2) + \\\\psi_a(2)\\\\psi_b(3)\\\\psi_c(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &{}-\\\\psi_a(2)\\\\psi_b(1)\\\\psi_c(3) - \\\\psi_a(3)\\\\psi_b(2)\\\\psi_c(1)- \\\\psi_a(1)\\\\psi_b(3)\\\\psi_c(2)\\\\Big). \\\\end{align} Consider the Slater determinant : D\\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\psi_a(1) & \\\\psi_a(2) & \\\\psi_a(3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_b(1) & \\\\psi_b(2) & \\\\psi_b(3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_c(1) & \\\\psi_c(2) & \\\\psi_c(3) \\\\end{vmatrix}. By the Laplace expansion along the first row of D : D = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(1) \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\psi_b(2) & \\\\psi_b(3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_c(2) & \\\\psi_c(3) \\\\end{vmatrix} -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(2) \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\psi_b(1) & \\\\psi_b(3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_c(1) & \\\\psi_c(3) \\\\end{vmatrix} +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(3) \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\psi_b(1) & \\\\psi_b(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_c(1) & \\\\psi_c(2) \\\\end{vmatrix}, so that : \\\\begin{align} D=& \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(1)\\\\Big( \\\\psi_b(2) \\\\psi_c(3) - \\\\psi_b(3) \\\\psi_c(2)\\\\Big) \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(2)\\\\Big( \\\\psi_b(1) \\\\psi_c(3) - \\\\psi_b(3) \\\\psi_c(1)\\\\Big) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}+ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\psi_a(3)\\\\Big( \\\\psi_b(1) \\\\psi_c(2) - \\\\psi_b(2) \\\\psi_c(1)\\\\Big) . \\\\end{align} By comparing terms we see that : D = \\\\sqrt{6}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\psi_a(1)\\\\psi_b(2)\\\\psi_c(3). Intermolecular antisymmetrizer  One often meets a wave function of the product form \\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A) \\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B) where the total wave function is not antisymmetric, but the factors are antisymmetric, : \\\\mathcal{A}^A \\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A) = \\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A) and : \\\\mathcal{A}^B\\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B) = \\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B). Here \\\\mathcal{A}^A antisymmetrizes the first NA particles and \\\\mathcal{A}^B antisymmetrizes the second set of NB particles. The operators appearing in these two antisymmetrizers represent the elements of the subgroups SNA and SNB, respectively, of SNA+NB. Typically, one meets such partially antisymmetric wave functions in the theory of intermolecular forces, where \\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A) is the electronic wave function of molecule A and \\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B) is the wave function of molecule B. When A and B interact, the Pauli principle requires the antisymmetry of the total wave function, also under intermolecular permutations. The total system can be antisymmetrized by the total antisymmetrizer \\\\mathcal{A}^{AB} which consists of the (NA \\\\+ NB)! terms in the group SNA+NB. However, in this way one does not take advantage of the partial antisymmetry that is already present. It is more economic to use the fact that the product of the two subgroups is also a subgroup, and to consider the left cosets of this product group in SNA+NB: : S_{N_A}\\\\otimes S_{N_B} \\\\subset S_{N_A+N_B} \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\forall \\\\pi \\\\in S_{N_A+N_B}:\\\\quad \\\\pi = \\\\tau \\\\pi_A \\\\pi_B, \\\\quad \\\\pi_A\\\\in S_{N_A}, \\\\;\\\\; \\\\pi_B \\\\in S_{N_B}, where œÑ is a left coset representative. Since : (-1)^\\\\pi = (-1)^\\\\tau (-1)^{\\\\pi_A} (-1)^{\\\\pi_B}, we can write : \\\\mathcal{A}^{AB} = \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB} \\\\mathcal{A}^A \\\\mathcal{A}^B\\\\quad\\\\hbox{with}\\\\quad \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB} = \\\\sum_{T=1}^{C_{AB}}(-1)^\\\\tau \\\\hat{T}, \\\\quad C_{AB} = \\\\binom{N_A+N_B}{N_A} . The operator \\\\hat{T} represents the coset representative œÑ (an intermolecular coordinate permutation). Obviously the intermolecular antisymmetrizer \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB} has a factor NA! NB! fewer terms then the total antisymmetrizer. Finally, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{A}^{AB}\\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A)&\\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB}\\\\Psi_A(1,2,\\\\dots,N_A) \\\\Psi_B(N_A+1,N_A+2,\\\\dots,N_A+N_B), \\\\end{align} so that we see that it suffices to act with \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{A}}^{AB} if the wave functions of the subsystems are already antisymmetric.

He was the son of shopkeepers who lived in Mariakerke. His mother's family was strongly socialistically engaged. In 1971, Daniel obtained a degree in accounting at the Stedelijk Instituut voor Handel en Secretariaat. He did his military service as from April 1972 until April 1973 and worked later on for ten years as a federal charge of LTA (Mutuality of Young Workers), the youth organization of the Socialist Unions at that time. Until 1980 he was also an information officer at the East Flemish Division (Bond Moyson) in the area Ghent-Eeklo. He has been elected to the city council since 1976. Later on, from 1983 until 1988, he was also director of De Ceder holiday centre in Deinze. He was the first director of the centre after a renovation which followed after many years of decline of the institution. Subsequently, from 1988 to 1995, he was secretary-treasurer of Bond Moyson, the year he took his first full-time political office as a councilor in Ghent. From 1995 until 2006, he was alderman of the harbour (Port of Ghent). Between 2001 and 2006 he was also alderman of festivities. After the municipal elections of 2006 he became mayor of Ghent. He was succeeded on January 1 2019 by Mathias De Clercq of Open VLD.  Political career  Although his parents were no socialist militants, Termont came in the political environment quite easily. Termont was at the age of fourteen an active member in the socialist movement, first as a participant and later as a member of the Socialist Trade Unions (see above). He was successively founder and president of the MJA and Jongsocialisten Mariakerke. 1973, he became chairman of the department in Mariakerke SP, the Socialist Party of that time. On his initiative came in 1979, a private room, community center De Vuist, a non-profit organization whose president is still Termont. 1976, Termont participated for the first time in local elections in Ghent and was immediately elected as Councillor, a mandate he has held continuously until today. During the administration period 1989-1995, he was leader of SP. In the municipal elections of 1995, Termont was again elected and continued his professional activities to be a full-time politician. In that year his first term as alderman of the port, economic development and utilities of the city of Ghent began. During the municipal elections of 2000 he was re-elected with over 5000 preferential votes. He retained the political responsibilities of the port of Ghent and Economy, and was celebrated. Within his party SP.a, Termont began in 2001 to his third term as a member of the National party office. During the municipal elections of 2006, he was the frontman of the list of the cartel SP.A-Spirit and led his party to victory. 2007, he followed then-mayor Frank Beke as the leader of Ghent-city.  Other mandates  Besides being mayor of Ghent, Dani√´l Termont holds several mandates in the energy sector. He is Vice President of (formerly Integrated TMVW Water Company), an intermunicipal water company, and vice president of the private gas company Fluxys which is the principal shareholder of the Belgian municipal holding company of gas company . He became president of the latter company in 2002, and also president of the Vlaamse Energieholding (as from 2004). Furthermore, Termont is vice-president and board member of the port of Ghent and directing member of Finiwo, the Intercommunal Finance for Investment in the provinces of West- and East-Flanders. He is also board member of the organization Buffalo NV, which is a subsidiary of the football club AA Gent, of which he is a big supporter. In 2014 Dani√´l Termont became the vice-chairman of Eurocities.  Decorations  In late 2014, mayor Daniel Termont was on the shortlist with 24 other nominees worldwide for the award of World Major. He came out second, after the mayor of Calgary (Cd). He was awarded the following decorations during his career: * Officer of the Order of the Crown (Officier in de Kroonorde) * Commander of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile) * Civil Medal First Class * Freeman of the city of Asunci√≥n (Paraguay)  Sources  * De Ceder, leisure and holiday centre of which Termont was the director. * Interview with Daniel Termont Diversito's website, a blog about diversity management. * Dial 2006, a website on the Ghent municipal elections of 2006. * Personal website of Daniel Termont.

Johannes (or Johann) Lingelbach (1622-1674) was a Dutch Golden Age painter, associated with the second generation of Bambocciate, a group of genre painters working in Rome from 1625‚Äì1700. Biography Lingelbach was born in Frankfurt, the son of David Lingelbach, a German technician, who in 1634 settled in Amsterdam with his wife and children. In 1638 the father hired and later established a labyrinth in the Jordaan. He furnished it with machines, that could move or play music and depicting biblical or mythological scenes. In the late 40s Johannes Lingelbach travelled to France (?) and Italy. After returning to Amsterdam, around 1653, Johannes married. Around 1662 Lingelbach lived in Reestraat, a small street near Prinsengracht; he became a close friend of Jurriaen Ovens. His work began to show an influence from Philips Wouwermans' landscapes. His skill in painting genre figures is no less accomplished in his depictions of architectural and natural objects. He was often invited to paint the figures and animals within other artists landscape pieces, such as the Dutch master landscape painter, Meindert Hobbema and Jan van der Heyden. His study of architectural forms came from observing the paintings of another Bamboccianti, Viviano Codazzi, an Architectural Vedutisti, or view painter. Lingelbach followed the style of the original Bamboccianti, Pieter van Laer, called Il Bamboccio, bringing his own Italianate style into influence of Northern European painters. He is one of the few Dutch painters of the Bamboccianti, whose works are documented in depth, making his influence greater in the progression of the style.\\"Lingelbach, Johannes\\", The Grove Dictionary of Art\\", 2000 Some of his works in Rome were once attributed to Pieter van Laer, but are now rightfully claimed to be Lingelbach‚Äôs, such as his, Roman Street Scene with Card Players, (National Gallery).

It was founded by Maharaja Gurbaksh Singh Sandhu in 1760. After India's independence, it was included in PEPSU and later in the Indian East Punjab after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The area of Kalsia is now located in the modern day Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. In 1940 the population of Kalsia was 67,393.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer, p. 900 Geography The area of Kalsia was 435 km¬≤ (168 sq mi), consisting of 20 detached pieces of territory in the Ambala and Ferozepur districts, lying mainly between 30¬∞ 12 and 30¬∞ 25 N and 77¬∞ 21 and 77¬∞ 35 E.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p. 320. It was divided into 3 major parts: two tehsils, Chhachhrauli and Basi, and a sub-tehsil named Chirak, in Ferozepur district. It had contained 181 villages in 1903. The capital of Kalsia state was Chhachhrauli. History The state of Kalsia was founded by Gurbaksh Singh in 1760. He joined the Kroria Misl of the Sikh confederacy. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had granted the estate of Chhachhrauli to Maharaja Gurbaksh Singh, a commander of his troops and a resident of Kalsia village. Maharaja Goorbaksh Singh named the state \\"Kalsia\\" and Chhachhrauli became its capital city. Maharaja Gurbaksh Singh was not famous, but his successor and son, Jodh Singh was an able person. At that time the area of Kalsia state comprised the territory between the Yamuna and the Markanda stream. Jodh Singh captured Dera Basi from Sardar Khajan Singh and also acquired territories of Lohal and Achrak. When Maharaja Ranjit Singh attacked and occupied Naraingarh in the Shivaliks in 1807, Jodh Singh was with him. In recognition of his services, Ranjit Singh presented him territories of Badala, Kameri and Chhabbal. Jodh Singh died in Multan in 1818. After his death, his son Sobha Singh assumed charge of Kalsia state and held it until his death in 1858. Lahna Singh, his successor sided with the British in crushing the revolt of 1857. After 1858, a period of peace started. When Lahna Singh assumed power, the Kalsia territory was intact as a British protectorate. The state's annual income was nearly Rs 300,000 per annum, and the population was around 62,000. After Lahna Singh, came Ranjit Singh Kalsia, then his son Ravi Sher Singh, and finally Ravi Karan Singh. Ravisher Singh in 1916 gave himself the title of Raja. The Kalsia rajas held their estate until 1947, when it was merged with the Indian Union. Both Ranjit Singh Kalsia and Ravi Sher Singh built several public utility buildings, including a charity hospital and schools. Raja Ravi Sher Kalsia Hospital was inaugurated in 1910 by Lt Governor of the Punjab, Sir Luis William Daney. The old court building still exists at Chhachhrauli. The dewan of the state used to live in an impressive building known as ‚ÄòJanak Niwas‚Äô. The Kalsias were undoubtedly staunch Nanakpanthis. In volume XIX (Part 1) of the Census of India 1891, E. D. Maclagan, the Provincial Superintendent of Census Operation, records: \\"Some eighty years ago (i.e., in 1811 AD) the grandfather of the present Lambardar of Jainpur village was carried off by the Sikh chief of Kalsia, and had all his fingers burnt off, because he refused to acknowledge that Nanak was the true Guru.\\" The state was under the political control of the commissioner of the Delhi division.

From the beginning of her career she possessed a natural acting style, an excellent knowledge of dance and ability to sing comic roles. From 1932, for a while she performed with her Italian artist husband in circuses abroad. In 1934 she made her debut in Budapest but was not contracted to any theatre. She was acting at the P√≥dium Cabaret. In 1940, the Capital Operetta Theatre contracted her, but she also performed at the Hungarian Theatre, the Andr√°ssy Avenue Theatre, the Erzs√©betv√°rosi Theatre, the M√°rkus Park Theatre and the Vid√°m Theatre. She joined the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z in 1943, by which time she had become one of the Budapest's favourite performers.

History Garendon was founded by Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, in 1133, and was probably a daughter house of Waverley Abbey in Surrey. Garendon was one of a number of religious establishments founded or patronised by Robert. He endowed the abbey with 690 acres of land in Garendon, a Burgage tenement in Leicester and land at Dishley, Shepshed and Ringolthorpe.'House of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Garendon', //A History of the County of Leicestershire//: volume 2 (1954), pp. 5-7. Date accessed: 20 June 2013 Within a century of foundation, the abbey gained lands at Burton on the Wolds, Eastwell, Ibstock, Stanton under Bardon and Welby, all in Leicestershire; land at Costock, Nottinghamshire; and at Heathcote, Derbyshire. Monastic granges were then developed near the abbey, and at Burton on the Wolds, Dishley, Goadby, Ibstock, Ringolthorpe, Stanton Under Bardon and Welby in Leicestershire; at Costock and Rempstone, Nottinghamshire; and in the Peak District, in Derbyshire. Through these granges the abbey conducted sheep farming \\"on a considerable scale\\". The abbey also gained two daughter houses, Biddlesden Abbey in Buckinghamshire, and Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire. By the end of the 13th century, the abbey had fallen on hard times. The abbey had acquired debts of ¬£120 and in 1295 the King had appointed a \\"special keeper\\" to administer the abbey's finance and deal with its debt problems. Despite the abbey's large endowments, its finances seem never to have recovered. In 1535 the abbey was recorded as having an annual income of ¬£100. 18s. 10¬Ωd, and that \\"the large old monastery was partly ruinous\\". It was dissolved with the smaller monasteries (those with annual incomes of under ¬£200) in 1536, with the abbot granted a pension of ¬£30 a year. \\"The Temple of Venus\\": one of the Palladian follies built when the Abbey's former estate was landscaped After Dissolution After the abbey was dissolved the abbey church was completely demolished.

The earl then constructed a house on the Abbey site, known as Garendon House. The house was owned by the Earls of Rutland until 1632, when it was given as part of a dowry for the marriage of Lady Katherine Manners (daughter of the 6th Earl of Rutland) and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. In 1640 the estate was valued at ¬£5,648 and was reported to contain 13,350 trees. In 1684 the 2nd Duke of Buckingham sold the house to Sir Ambrose Phillipps (a successful lawyer) for ¬£28,000. Sir Ambrose and his son William did little to the house; his grandson, another Ambrose Phillipps, an accomplished gentleman architect inspired by his Grand Tour of France and Italy, started to change the house and the former abbey estate. Beginning in 1734, Ambrose landscaped the surrounding parkland and built to his own designs,Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Phillipps, Ambrose: Garendon Park\\". several Palladian follies, which still exist. Ambrose later began to redesign, extend and rebuild Garendon House in the Palladian style, developing it into what would be known as Garendon Hall. However, the work remained unfinished in 1737 when Ambrose died childless; it was completed by his brother Samuel, who inherited the estate.\\"Garendon Hall\\" , Lost Heritage. Following Ambrose's death, the family were left with a difficult financial situation and needed to tighten its belt. In 1885 they moved out of Garendon and into Grace Dieu Manor. A return to fortune allowed the family to return to Garendon once more in 1907, however. The house was used and heavily damaged by the army during the Second World War. The ever-increasing cost of running and maintaining the building, coupled with threats to the house's parkland from the urban sprawl of Loughborough and the construction of the M1 Motorway, which cut directly through the park, it was decided the house was to be demolished. This happened in June 1964, with the house being deliberately set fire to first in order to provide practice and training for the local fire brigade. The house was reduced to rubble which was then used in the construction of the nearby M1. In 1964 the family returned for a final time to Grace Dieu Manor, but sold that house within a decade (Grace Dieu Manor then became a Catholic school). In 1972 the family moved to Quenby Hall, but following the collapse of the family cheese-making business, the family has been forced to offer the Hall for sale (it has been for sale since 2012).The de Lisles downsize: Quenby Hall for sale  The Country Seat Abbots of Garendon Abbey *Robert, occurs 1144-5. *Geoffrey, occurs 1147. *Thurstan, occurs between 1155 and 1164.

Burials *Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester Layout and remains The abbey is thought to have been quite large: with the complex occupying an area of around 70m x 80m. St Bernard of Clairvaux, one of the founders of the Cistercian Order, disapproved of ornate church architecture and sculpture, which was subsequently banned by the order. Cistercian architecture and decoration was thus often very simple. Following the dissolution of the abbey, Garendon Hall (aligned north-south) was built straddling the location of the former abbey church (which was aligned east- west). The cellars of the hall incorporated 13th-century stonework which may have been original. The cellars also contained a pair of \\"stone lined wells\\".Loughborough Past and Present: Garendon Abbey Following the demolition of Garendon Hall, the site of the former abbey was able to be excavated. Excavations undertaken in 1966-68 located the foundations of the former abbey's chapter house and dormitory. The excavation also located the remains of the chapels attached to the transepts of the abbey church. It was also discovered that the abbey's drain was used as part of the sewage system of Garendon Hall. The remains of the chapter house and drains were left exposed, although are on private property.

Cerdo started out as a follower of Simon Magus, like Basilides and Saturninus, and taught at about the same time as Valentinus, Marcion and them. According to Irenaeus, he was a contemporary of the Roman bishop Hyginus, residing in Rome as a prominent member of the Church until his forced expulsion therefrom. He taught that there were two gods, one that demanded obedience while the other was good and merciful. According to Cerdo, the former was the God of the Old Testament who had created the world. He also said that the latter God was superior but that he was only known through his son, Jesus. Like later gnostics, he was a docetist who rejected the bodily resurrection of the dead. Doctrine According to the account of Irenaeus (i. 27 and iii. 4), Cerdo had not the intention of founding a sect apart from the church. He describes him as more than once coming to the church and making public confession, and so going on, now teaching his doctrine in secret, now again making public confession, now convicted in respect of his evil teaching, and removed from the communion of the brethren (aphistamenos tes ton adelphon synodias). Some understand this to mean that Cerdo voluntarily withdrew himself from communion, but it is preferred to understand the word passively, with the old translator of Irenaeus, \\"abstentus est a religiosorum hominum conventu.\\" The account given by Irenaeus of the doctrine of Cerdo is that he taught that the God preached by the law and the prophets was not the Father of Jesus Christ; for that the former was known, the latter unknown; the former was just, the latter good. The account given by Pseudo-Tertullian (Haer. vi.) may be regarded as representing that given in the earlier Syntagma of Hippolytus, which was also made use of by Philaster (Haer. 44) and Epiphanius (Haer. 41). It runs that Cerdo introduced two first principles (archai) and two gods, the one good, the other evil, the latter of whom was the creator of the world. Here we are to note the important difference that to the good god is opposed in the account of Irenaeus a just one; in that of Hippolytus, an evil one. In the later Refutation of Hippolytus, Cerdo is said to have taught three principles of the universe, agathon, dikaion, hylen. Ps.-Tertullian goes on to say that Cerdo rejected the law and the prophets, and renounced the Creator, teaching that Christ was the son of the higher good deity, and that he came not in the substance of flesh but in appearance only, and had not really died or really been born of a virgin. He adds that Cerdo only acknowledged a resurrection of the soul, denying that of the body. Ps.-Tertullian adds, but without support from the other authorities, that Cerdo received only the Gospel of St. Luke, and that in a mutilated form; that he rejected some of Paul's epistles and some portions of others, and completely rejected the Acts and the Apocalypse. There is every appearance that Ps.-Tertullian here transferred to Cerdo what in his authority was stated of Marcion. Marcion It does not appear that Cerdo left any writings, nor is there evidence that those who report to us his doctrine had any knowledge of it independent of the form it took in the teaching of his Marcionite successors. Consequently, it is not possible now to determine with any certainty how much of the teaching of Marcion had been anticipated by Cerdo, or to say what points of disagreement there were between the teaching of the two. Hippolytus, in his Refutation, makes no attempt to discriminate the doctrines of Cerdo and Marcion. Tertullian, in his work against Marcion, mentions Cerdo four times, but each time only as Marcion's predecessor. Cerdonians Epiphanius gives a heading to a sect of Cerdonians. Preceding writers speak only of Cerdo, but not of Cerdonians; and it is probable that his followers were early merged in the school of Marcion, who is said to have joined himself to Cerdo soon after his arrival in Rome. Date St. Hyginus. Epiphanius and Philaster assert him to have been a native of Syria, and Irenaeus states that he came to Rome in the episcopate of Hyginus. This episcopate lasted four years, and Lipsius (Chronologie der r√∂mischen Bisch√∂fe) places its termination AD 139-141. Having in regard the investigations of M. Waddington concerning the year of Polycarp's martyrdom, Cerdo's arrival at Rome has been placed as early as AD 135. Eusebius in his Chronicle (Sch√∂ne, i. 168) places it under the last year of Hadrian, AD 137; Jerome substitutes a date three years later. So, likewise, Theodoret (Haer. Fab. i. 24) places the Roman activity of Cerdo under the reign of Antoninus. In the place already cited from the first book of Irenaeus, in which he speaks of the coming of Cerdo to Rome, all the MSS. agree in describing Hyginus as the ninth bishop from the apostles; and this reading is confirmed by Eusebius (H. E. iv. 11), by Cyprian (Ep. 74, ad Pompeium), and by Epiphanius. On the other hand, in the passage from the third book, though Eusebius here too reads \\"ninth,\\" the MS. evidence is decisive that Irenaeus here describes Hyginus as the eighth bishop, and this agrees with the list of Roman bishops given in the preceding chapter, and with the description of Anicetus as the tenth bishop a couple of chapters further on. Lipsius hence infers that Irenaeus drew his account of Cerdo from two sources, in which Hyginus was differently described; but in the interval between the composition of his first and third books, Irenaeus may have been led to alter his way of counting by the investigations concerning the succession of the Roman bishops which he had in the meantime either made himself or adopted from Hegesippus. As for the numeration \\"ninth,\\" it is uncertain whether it indicates a list in which Peter was counted first bishop, or one in which Cletus and Anacletus were reckoned as distinct.

His first win came in his next race 2 March 2004 in a C0 to C1 heat over 2,138 metres at Albion Park. The horse went on to win 24 of its first 27 starts, half of which were driven by John's son - Luke McCarthy. Be Good Johnny stepped up to higher class races in the middle of 2005 just as the Australian harness season was about to begin in Queensland. Wins including the Red October Final, Seymour Charity Cup Final as well as placings in the Albion Park Final (2nd to Home of Jack), Sunshine Sprint (2nd to Cobbity Classic), Gold Coast Cup (2nd to Double Identity in a track record 1:53.5) and the Queensland Pacing Championship (3rd after galloping at the start). Against quality fields Be Good Johnny had proven himself worthy of better things to come. Running a track record mile rate (1:56.2) at Albion Park for the 2680m gave him his first Grand Circuit win in the 2005 Trans-Tasman Cup. Be Good Johnny fought off the last-lap challenge of New South Wales pacer Dinki Di. Be Good Johnny made his first trip interstate for the Australasian Grand Circuit winning the 2005 Miracle Mile Pace and Victoria Cup. His tiredness from a season of rising through the ranks of Australian pacing showed by finishing 8th in the Interdominion held in Tasmania. Be Good Johnny came back from a spell after the Interdominion in October 2006, winning the Gold Coast Cup in a mile rate of 1:54.0 (the best by any pacer in Australia this year). He went on to defend the title of the Miracle Mile Pace, making him just the sixth horse to achieve the feat (the last being Sokyola). The horse failed to place in the Victoria Cup and 2007 Interdominion final held at Globe Derby. Be Good Johnny claimed his second Trans-Tasman in May, 2008.

S. arabica is similar in morphology to other sillaginids, although has a distinctive shortened snout which gives the species its common name. This species is of no current interest to local fisheries, although beach seines may take minor amounts of this species. Taxonomy and naming The shortnose whiting belongs to the genus Sillago, a subdivision of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The Sillaginidae are in the suborder Percoidei, a division of the Perciformes. The species was identified and named Sillago arabica by Roland McKay and L.J. McCarthy in 1989, after examining the holotype which was initially collected in Tanajib Bay in the Persian Gulf during 1982. The authors also termed the common name 'shortnose whiting' for the species, as its uniquely short snout is a key identifying feature in the field. Description The shortnose whiting shares the same basic profile as most of the genus Sillago, possessing an elongate, slightly compressed body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The profile of the species is slightly leaner than most of its close relatives, which may be one initial key to field identification. More definitive diagnostic features include the spine and ray count of the dorsal and anal fins as well as the morphology of the swim bladder. The first dorsal fin consists of 12 or 13 spines, while the second dorsal fin has one spine and 22 to 24 soft rays posterior to the spine. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin with 2 spines followed by 22 to 24 soft rays. The species has 75 to 80 lateral line scales and a total of 38 to 40 vertebrae, also diagnostic features. The species is one of the smaller whitings, growing only to a maximum length of 15 cm overall. The swim bladder of S. arabica has no anterior extensions and a single posterior extension. The anterior margin of the organ is slightly rounded, while a duct like tubular process extends from the ventral surface to the urogenital opening. The species has pale sandy brown colour overall, with a slightly paler belly and slightly darker upper operculum. There are no dark blotches present on the side of the fish, while the first and second dorsal fins and caudal fin are dusted with black. Distribution and habitat The shortnose whiting is entirely restricted to the Persian Gulf, where it inhabits the shallow coastal waters out to a depth of 5m. The species is often caught in seine nets along beaches in the Persian Gulf, although no fishery exists for the species. As mentioned previously, the species has had very little data collected on it, with the initial description by McKay and McCarthy in 1989 the only major study on the species.

The ring road consists of Jalan Pemuda (Johor State Route J152), Jalan Hassan (Johor State Route J216), Segamat Second Bridge, Jalan Hassan Abdullah (both are Johor State Route J217), Jalan Pee Kang Hai and Jalan Chia Chin Koon. History Before 20th century, the main medium of transportation in Segamat was via rivers. However, the mode of transportation in Segamat began to change when the British colonial government began constructing the national railroad system and road networks (Federal Route 1 and Federal Route 23 passing through Segamat. As a result, several municipal roads were also built as well to connect the nearby villages to Segamat. Since then, Jalan Pemuda and Jalan Hassan were primarily used as bypass routes when the main road (Federal Route 1 were closed during special occasions and events. The traffic rate along Federal Route 1 continued to rise every year as a result of the population increase, therefore the 8-kilometer section of the main road in Segamat was upgraded to 4-lane single-carriageway (dual-carriageway in the town center) in 1985. As a result of the rise of traffic rate, traffic jams are common especially at the main bridge of Segamat. As a result, the federal government of Malaysia decided to build a second bridge of Segamat to reduce traffic congestion at the main bridge. The construction of the bridge began at the end of 1998 and completed in 2001. Soon after the completion of the bridge, a new dual-carriageway road, Jalan Hassan Abdullah, was constructed by Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) of Segamat, connecting the second bridge to Jalan Pee Kang Hai. In 1996, Segamat was chosen as the state-level host of the Malaysian National Day. At that time, the detour routes especially the 2-lane Jalan Hassan and Jalan Pemuda were badly congested and were unable to handle the incredible volume of traffic during the celebration. As a result, the JKR of Segamat decided to develop an inner ring road system by upgrading the existing 2-lane municipal roads such as Jalan Pemuda, Jalan Hassan, Jalan Pee Kang Hai and Jalan Chia Chin Koon to 4-lane single carriageway. The construction of Segamat Second Bridge was also included in the ring road package. Construction began right after the completion of Segamat Second Bridge in 2001 and completed in August 2005, several weeks before National Day celebration of 2005.

The leaves are a glossy green and grow to long. The stems are long, thin, and climbing. The leaves alternate and are 2-5 cm while the five petals are about 2 cm wide and can be pale blue, blue or violet in color. There also variations with white (P. auriculata var. alba) or deep blue (P. auriculata 'Royal Cape') flowers. The flowers are arranged in a corymb-like and raceme inflorescence.https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantDetail/1365 The flower of this plant is complete and perfect. The sepals and petals are connate while the pistil is adnate. The ovary of the flower is superior and the flower has regular symmetry. It has basal placentation, with 1 locule and 5 carpels. Phytochemistry Many secondary metabolites have been discovered and isolated from Plumbago auriculata such as plumbagin and palmitic acids. Cultivation In temperate regions it may be grown outside in frost free areas, otherwise under glass. It grows best in full sun to part shade. The species and the white-flowered form P. auriculata f. alba have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

He pitched for the New York Yankees in 1959 and 1960 and for the Los Angeles Angels from 1961 through 1963. Grba began his professional baseball career in the Boston Red Sox' organization, and was traded to the Yankees in 1957. After two years in the United States Army, Grba made his major league debut on July 10, 1959. He was the first selection of the 1960 MLB expansion draft by the Los Angeles Angels, and started their first game in 1961. He last pitched in MLB in 1963, and worked as a Minor League Baseball coach, scout, and manager from 1969 through 1971 and from 1982 through 1997. Early life Grba was born to Joseph and Eva Grba, Serbian immigrants who lived in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up on Chicago's South Side. His father left the family when Eli was young and he was raised alone by his mother, who worked as a waitress during the day and in a factory at night. Grba attended Bowen High School, where he starred in three sports. Career After he graduated from Bowen in 1952, Grba signed a professional baseball contract with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his professional debut in 1953 for the Salisbury Rocots of the Class D Tar Heel League, and was named an All-Star. He spent the 1954 season with the Corning Red Sox of the Class D Pennsylvania ‚Äì Ontario ‚Äì New York League (PONY League), and was again named an All-Star. He led all pitchers in the PONY League in strikeouts, games started, and innings pitched. The Red Sox promoted Grba to the San Jose Red Sox of the Class C California League for the 1955 season, and then to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1956. Manager Eddie Joost began to use Grba as a relief pitcher in deference to more veteran pitchers on the San Francisco pitching staff. During spring training in 1957, the Red Sox traded Grba and Gordie Windhorn to the New York Yankees for Bill Renna. He was drafted into the United States Army before the end of spring training, and spent the next two years stationed in Fort Jackson and Fort McPherson, playing baseball and basketball on base teams. Grba began the 1959 season with the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League, and made his major league debut for the Yankees on July 10, 1959. He finished the season with the Yankees and had a 2‚Äì5 win-loss record and a 6.44 earned run average (ERA). Grba began the 1960 season with Richmond. He started the season pitching to a 7‚Äì1 win-loss record and was again promoted to the Yankees in July. He had a 6‚Äì4 win-loss record, a 3.68 ERA, and one save for the Yankees in 1960. The Yankees included Grba on their roster for the 1960 World Series. He appeared in one game as a pinch runner. The Yankees did not protect Grba in the 1960 MLB expansion draft, held after the 1960 season. On the advice of former Yankees' manager Casey Stengel, the Los Angeles Angels chose Grba with the first selection. Grba started the first game in club history on April 11, 1961, pitching nine innings in a 7‚Äì2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. He had an 11‚Äì13 win-loss record in 1961, and an 8‚Äì9 win-loss record and a 4.54 ERA in 1962. In 1963, Grba had a 0‚Äì1 record in 12 games for the Angels, who tried to trade him to other MLB teams, unsuccessfully. The Angels sold Grba to the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League during the 1963 season. He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League in 1964, and was named an All-Star. He returned to Hawaii in 1965 and pitched for the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican League in 1966. Grba attempted to make a return to the major leagues in 1967 with the Chicago White Sox. He pitched for the Indianapolis Indians of the Pacific Coast League, and retired after the 1967 season. He had a 28‚Äì33 win-loss record and a 4.48 ERA in MLB. Grba worked odd jobs before working for the Oakland Athletics as a scout from 1969 through 1971. He managed the Lodi Crushers of the Class A California League in 1969. Grba returned to baseball in 1982 as a pitching coach in minor league baseball for the Vancouver Canadians in the Milwaukee Brewers' organization. He also served as a manager of the Reno Silver Sox of the California League in 1989, and the Princeton Patriots of the Appalachian League in 1990. Grba then joined the Philadelphia Phillies organization as a manager and pitching coach in the minor leagues and became a scout for five years, until retiring in 1997. Personal life Grba was married four times. Grba and his first wife, Bonnie, had two children. He met his third wife while he worked in Vancouver. Grba and his fourth wife, Regina, married in 1993, and they lived in Florence, Alabama. Grba died on January 14, 2019, at age 84, from pancreatic cancer. Grba drank heavily during his career, and developed alcoholism. He was arrested five times for driving under the influence of alcohol and suffered six seizures relating to his alcohol use. In 2016, Grba published a memoir, Eli Grba, Baseball‚Äôs Fallen Angel, cowritten by Doug Williams, which discussed his alcohol use and recovery.

In 1958, when Collingwood won the Grand Final, defeating Melbourne 12.10 (82) to 9.10 (64) ‚Äî and, in the process, preventing Melbourne from matching Collingwood's record of winning four premierships in a row (viz., 1927, 1928, 1920, and 1930) ‚Äî Gabelich played a strong robust game as a back-pocket ruckman\\"Grand Final Teams\\", The Age, (Friday, 19 September 1958), p.36.\\"Barassi Bites the Mud\\", The Age, (Monday, 22 September 1958), p.18.. and, \\"with his terrific strength [and taking] control of the packs\\", Gabelich was instrumental in Collingwood turning a 17-point deficit at quarter-time into a two-point lead at half-time, and a 33-point lead at three-quarter time.Beames, P., \\"Magpies End Long Melbourne Reign: Great Comeback Wins 1958 Premiership\\", The Age, (Monday, 22 September 1958), p.20. He was runner-up in the 1959 Brownlow to St Kilda's Verdun Howell and South Melbourne's Bob Skilton (who had tied for first),AFL Tables: 1959 Brownlow Medal. and he won the Copeland Trophy as Collingwood's best and fairest in 1960.  Olympic Games  He played as a back-pocket resting ruckman for the combined VFL and VFA team against the VAFA in the demonstration match of Australian rules football, during the Melbourne Olympic Games, on Friday, 7 December 1956.Mcfarlane, G., \\"Collingwood's connection with the Olympic Games\\", Collingwood Football Club, 1 August 2012.  Darwin  At the end of the 1959 season, Gabelich, unemployed, and surviving only on his (at the time meagre) football payments from Collingwood, sought a clearance to West Perth‚Äîwhere, in addition to his football payments, he had been promised \\"a full directorship of an estate agency which would guarantee him a minimum income of ¬£4,000 a year\\"According to the RBA's Pre-Decimal Inflation Calculator, approximately the equivalent of $AUS115,000.00 per annum in 2017.‚Äîand had been told, by Collingwood, that no decision could be made until a new, 1960, committee had been elected. A frustrated Gabelich flew to Darwin on Friday, 8 January 1960, played with the Waratah Football Club on the Saturday, and on the following Monday commenced work as a storeman in a hardware store.Shocks Perth Officials\\", The Age, (Tuesday, 12 January 1960), p.24. On the following Saturday (16 January) morning, Gabelich contacted the Collingwood secretary (Gordon Carlyon) and, having received an assurance from Carlyon that Collingwood would support his request to the VFL to be allowed to play for the Waratah Football Club in the Victorian off-season, he agreed to not play on that Saturday, in the hope that would not further prejudice his request.Beames, P., \\"Gabelich Seeks V.F.L. Approval\\", The Age, (Monday, 18 January 1960), p.24. After a discussion that concluded that \\"follower Ray Gabelich has not broken any A.N.F.C.regulation, or incurred automatic disqualification by playing in Darwin\\", Collingwood decided to refer the matter to the VFL for guidance, before making a final decision.\\"Gabelich is Within Rules Says Club\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 20 January 1960), p.26. Despite Collingwood's argument that Gabelich's actions did not warrant automatic disqualification, because (a) \\"Darwin was not a State\\", and (b) \\"Gabelich had played out of [Victorian] season\\", the VFL ‚Äî taking the view that Gabelich's decision to play in Darwin was \\"an embarrassment\\" ‚Äî decided to seek advice from the Australian National Football Council before making any decision.Beames, P., \\"Gabelich Case for A.N.F.C.\\", (Saturday, 23 January 1960), p.16. In March 1960, Having played a number of games in Darwin,Although there are no precise records available on the exact number of games he played, Barfoot & Lee (1995), p.98, are certain that he played more than one game: \\"Ray Gabelich played a couple of games for Waratahs in 1961/62\\" (Barfoot, Michael & Lee, David, History of the NTFL, (Darwin), 1955 ) Gabelich decided to temporarily abandon his plans to play with West Perth, and chose to play another season with Collingwood.\\"Gabelich Settles Magpie Doubts About His Future\\", The Age, (Tuesday, 1 march 1960), p.22.\\"New Magpies Disappointing\\", The Age, (Monday, 21 March 1960), p.22.\\"VFL Teams Chosen (For Round One)\\", The Age, (Saturday, 16 April 1960), p.22.  Return to Western Australia  In 1961 he returned to Western Australia where spent the entire season playing with West Perth, during which time he also represented Western Australia at the 1961 Brisbane Australian National Football Council Carnival, playing at centre-half back (and, in the process, he completely nullified South Melbourne's champion centre half-forward Jim Taylor) in the West Australian team that not only (unexpectedly) defeated the Victorian representative team 15.14 (104) to 14.11 (95) in \\"a fiercely fought match\\", but also, through that victory, won the ANFC Carnival title.Carter, R., \\"W.A.

In 1965, an overweight Gabelich's pre-season training was greatly affected by (a) his having undergone a major operation on his nose in early February,Hobbs, M., \\"Magpies down to business\\", The Age, (Tuesday, 9 February 1965), p.26. (b) his having undergone a minor ear operation in early March, and, also, (c) having an emergency admission to hospital on 16 March. In the early hours of 17 March 1965, he was operated on, and his appendix was removed. The medical advice given to Collingwood at the time was that Gabelich would be unable to begin training (let alone playing) until after round 2, on 24 April.Carter, R, \\"Gabelich likely to Miss Six Games: Operation Blow\\", The Age (Thursday, 18 March 1965), p.28.

With five minutes to go, the ball had been passed to Gabelich by Des Tuddenham. Gabelich, Collingwood's team captain, then ran awkwardly towards the Collingwood goal, struggling to control the ball, and bouncing the ball four times in a run of, at least fifty yards and, then, kicking a goal that put Collingwood in front ‚Äî with a close range kick that almost went out of the ground: . However, Gabelich's goal did not win the match. A minute later, Melbourne defender Neil Crompton kicked a goal, putting Melbourne in front by four points. Collingwood were unable to score again.\\"Tense finish sees flag to Demons\\", The Canberra Times, (Monday, 21 September 1964), p.15.Carter, R., \\"'Crazy' Moves Gave Demons Win: Ray Gabelich's Dash in Vain\\", The Age, (Monday, 21 September 1964), p.24.\\"Grand Final was one of Football's Thrillers\\", The Age, (Monday, 21 September 1964), p.22..\\"Gabo's run ends with a snap\\", Herald Sun, 14 March 2012.  1966 Grand Final  Gabelich's last match for Collingwood (aged 33) was in the team that lost the 1966 VFL Grand Final to St Kilda by one point.The Teams, The Canberra Times, Saturday, 24 September 1966), p.28. He kicked two goals, one behind, and was one of Collingwood's best players: ::What a useless task it is trying to use brute strength to halt the passage of 17 st. 4 lb. [110kg] Collingwood follower Ray Gabelich. Three St. Kilda players realised this early in the second quarter when they tried to drag \\"Gabbo\\" down in the goal square as he moved towards goal. Gabelich shrugged them off and calmly snapped the ball through for full points. It was his second goal.\\"From the Game\\", The Age, (Monday, 26 September 1966), p.24.  Tribunal  Gabelich was reported twice in his 160-game, 13 season career with Collingwood.  1960  The first was in a \\"fiery match\\"Meeking, M., \\"Magpies on Top in Fiery Match\\", The Age, (Monday 22 August 1960), p.22. against South Melbourne on 20 August 1960 (round 17), when he was charged with striking South Melbourne‚Äôs Ken Boyd in the face with a closed fist during a contest for the ball at a ball-up during the third quarter.\\"Reported Players\\", The Age, (Monday 22 August 1960), p.22. Defended by barrister, ex-Collingwood footballer, and Collingwood committeeman Frank Galbally,\\"He's in the Clear\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 24 August 1960), p.26. Gabelich produced five witnesses: (a) Gabelich himself; (b) Collingwood player (Ken Turner), (c) \\"Mr. L. Smith\\", a Collingwood supporter, who had served 31 years in the police force, (d) ex-Melbourne footballer and 3AW football commentator Doug Heywood, and (e) Len Herath, \\"a former football umpire and president of the Umpires Association of Mildura\\". The evidence presented to the VFL Tribunal (with Boyd present, displaying a badly injured nose) claimed that (a) despite the muddy condition of the ground surface at Victoria Park, rather than throwing the ball in the air, the umpire had chosen to bounce it, (b) the umpire had not bounced the ball well on what was a very muddy surface at Victoria Park (the ball went low and veered to the side), (c) Gabelich had definitely struck directly at the ball and missed (i.e., rather than intentionally punching Boyd), (d) when rucking, Gabelich consistently punched the ball and never palmed it (thus, his use of a fist did not suggest any intention of punching Boyd). While the tribunal concluded that \\"the only thing we can be certain of is that Boyd was struck on the nose\\", it also declared that \\"we cannot be satisfied that Gabelich deliberately struck Boyd\\"; and, as a consequence, dismissed the charge against Gabelich.\\"Gabelich, Taylor Found Not Guilty: Striking Charges are Dismissed\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 24 August 1960), p.26.  1962  The second was in the 23 June 1962 (round 9) game against Fitzroy, when Gabelich was charged with striking Fitzroy's Ron Harvey in the second quarter of the match.\\"Reported Players\\", The Age, (Monday, 25 June 1962), p.18. Although it seems transparently clear from the evidence given to the tribunal that Gabelich was retaliating to an assault by Harvey, none of the officials in control of the game had seen any such activity from Harvey. Given that fact, and from the evidence presented from the field umpire (Jim Brewer), it was obvious that regardless of whatever it was had preceded the incident, Gabelich had, indeed, struck Harvey. The tribunal took just three minutes to find Gabelich guilty and suspended him for two matches.\\"Gabelich and Gahan Suspended for Two Weeks\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 27 June 1962), p.18. Although, with Gabelich missing, and only winning one out of every three ruck contests,Balfe, N., \\"Magpie Strength Tells at Finish\\", The Age, (Monday, 2 July 1962), p16.. Collingwood won its next match without Gabelich: (round 10) (Collingwood 14.16 (100) to Richmond 13.10 (88). Collingwood, still without Gabelich, and despite being five points ahead at three-quarter time, faded in the last quarter and lost the strongly contested next match, (round 11) against Essendon, the eventual 1962 premiers (Collingwood 11.11 (77) to Essendon 13.16 (94)). In the view of many, Collingwood may well have won the match had Gabelich been playing in support of his regular Collingwood teammate, ruckman Neville Withers:\\"V.F.L. Teams Chosen: Essendon v. Collingwood\\", The Age, (Friday, 6 July 1962), p22.Ross, J., \\"Don's Skill Tells Over The Age, (Monday, 9 July 1962), p.16. ::[In this afternoon's match] Essendon should initiate more moves from the rucks than Collingwood. [With Gabelich missing from their lineup] the Magpies have no one to clamp down on Geoff Leek, who has the support of Hugh Mitchell, Don McKenzie, and Ken Timms. Their work [in the ruck] should be topped off by [rover] Jack Clarke, one of the most effective players in the game.

The Act allowed a crime committed outside the City of London or the County of Middlesex to be tried at the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, rather than locally. The Act was passed in direct and urgent response to anxieties that doctor and accused murderer William Palmer would not be able to have a fair trial at the assize court in his native Staffordshire because of public revulsion at the allegations. By conducting Palmer's trial at a neutral venue, there could be no appeal for a retrial on the basis that the court and jury had been prejudiced against the defendant. However, an alternative hypothesis is that Palmer was a popular figure in Rugeley and would not have been found guilty by a Staffordshire jury: the implication being that the trial location was moved for political reasons so as to secure a guilty verdict.

The former , third baseman was initially signed by the Cincinnati Redlegs prior to the season. He played in their minor league system in 1955 and briefly in 1956, before leaving organized baseball‚Äîhe returned to the Cincinnati farm system in 1960. Prior to the season, he was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies, but was never called up to the major league level. After the season, on November 27, 1961, he was acquired by the Angels in the 1961 Rule 5 draft. Torres played three seasons in Major League Baseball, making his major league debut with the Los Angeles Angels in . On April 10, 1962, Torres went 0-for-4 in his major league debut against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Illinois. In his third career game, a 5‚Äì0 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, Torres earned his first career hit, a leadoff double off of Twins' pitcher Jim Kaat. In , his rookie season, the career .254 hitter hit 11 home runs and batted in 74 runs, far more than the 51 he would knock in the next season. In 127 games, he batted .259 and scored a career-high 44 runs. During the season, Torres played in a career-high 138 games, but had his least-productive power-hitting season, launching only 4 home runs. Torres did, however, hit .261 on 121 hits, both career-high marks. Torres hit a career- high 12 home runs in , the third highest total by an Angel that year, behind only teammates Joe Adcock (21) and Jim Fregosi (18). Although he reached a career high in 1964 in both home runs and slugging percentage, he set career- lows in games played, runs, hits, RBIs, and batting average before eventually settling into retirement following the season. Although he was mostly known for his playing time for the Angels, before his Major League Baseball career began, he participated in the 1960 Caribbean Series. Torres tied for the tournament lead in home runs, hitting three in the week-long competition.

Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.Health Protection Agency. Louping ill. Background information. Last reviewed: 8 August 2008. Last viewed 23 April 2009.  Cause  Louping ill is caused by RNA virus called Louping ill virus. Louping ill virus belongs to genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. There are four subtypes: British, Irish, Spanish and Turkish.  Prevention  According to a ProMED article, disease in sheep has been controlled in the UK by a vaccine (ATCvet code: QI04AA01), originally developed by Scotland's Moredun Research Institute by Prof John Russell Greig. In 2009, however, a shortage of vaccine combined with an increase in the number of ticks found in sheep pasture areas cause an increased risk of this disease.

Horn and Charles R. Johnson (1991), Topics in Matrix Analysis. Cambridge University Press, They are named after the mathematician Ferdinand Frobenius. Each covariant is a projection on the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue . Frobenius covariants are the coefficients of Sylvester's formula, which expresses a function of a matrix as a matrix polynomial, namely a linear combination of that function's values on the eigenvalues of . Formal definition Let be a diagonalizable matrix with eigenvalues Œª1, ‚Ä¶, Œªk. The Frobenius covariant , for i = 1,‚Ä¶, k, is the matrix : A_i \\\\equiv \\\\prod_{j=1 \\\\atop j e i}^k \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_i-\\\\lambda_j} (A - \\\\lambda_j I)~.

Overview Mormon baptism Much of the Latter Day Saint theology of baptism was established during the early Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith. Baptism must be by immersion and is for the remission of sins (meaning that through baptism, past sins are forgiven), and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance. Latter Day Saint baptism does not purport to remit any sins other than personal ones, as adherents do not believe in original sin. Baptisms also occur only after an \\"age of accountability\\" which is defined as the age of eight years. The theology thus rejects infant baptism. According to the account in Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory 1:68,Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory 1:68 the first Latter Day Saint baptisms occurred on May 15, 1829, when Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery baptized each other in the Susquehanna River near Harmony, Pennsylvania shortly after receiving the Aaronic priesthood from John the Baptist. In addition, Latter Day Saint theology requires baptism only be performed by a priesthood holder.See, e.g., Guide to the Scriptures: Baptism, Baptize, ¬ßProper authority. The minimum required priesthood level to perform a baptism in Mormonism is priest, who is a worthy male members at least 15 years old,See, e.g., Gospel Topics: Priest, churchofjesuschrist.org. and the rite is overseen by a bishop. Because the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement operate under a lay priesthood, children raised in a Mormon family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member. Latter Day Saints view baptism as symbolic of Jesus' death, burial and resurrection,See, e.g., Bible Dictionary: Baptism, ¬∂2. and also symbolic of the baptized individual separating from the \\"natural\\" or sinful aspects of humanity and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of Jesus. Mormon baptism ceremony, circa the 1850s Membership into a Latter Day Saint church is granted only by baptism. Most Latter Day Saint churches do not recognize the baptisms of other faiths as they believe baptisms must be performed under the church's unique priesthood authority. Therefore, any converts are baptized at their conversion. Baptism (and any subsequent callings in the church) are preceded by a baptismal interview.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Procedures Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants first documented the instructions for Latter Day Saint baptism. People being baptized or performing the baptism typically wear a \\"one-piece suit\\" with \\"short sleeves, and is lined to the knee.\\" Baptisms are usually performed in a baptismal font, but any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed is acceptable. The person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly, and immerse every part, limb, hair and clothing of the person being baptized. If there are any mistakes, or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed, the baptism is repeated until it is performed correctly. In addition to the baptizer, two church members witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly.Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B: Performing Priesthood Ordinances, ¬ßBaptism.[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/october-2019-general- conference-first-presidency-leadership-sessiontitle=General Conference Leadership Meetings Beginaccess-date=2019-10-03 Following baptism, Latter Day Saints receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands of a Melchizedek priesthood holder.Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B: Performing Priesthood Ordinances, ¬ßConfirmation. Baptism for the dead Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple basement. The basement of the temple was used as the baptistery, containing a large baptismal font in the center of the main room. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) practices baptism for the dead \\"vicariously\\" or \\"by proxy\\" in their temples for anyone who did not receive these ordinances while living.Baptisms for the Dead, churchofjesuschrist.org Rebaptism After the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in 1844, rebaptism became a more important ordinance in the LDS Church, as led by Brigham Young. Young led his group to the Great Basin in what is now Utah, and most of his followers were rebaptised soon after arriving as a sign that they would rededicate their lives to Christ. During the \\"Mormon Reformation\\" of 1856‚Äì57, rebaptism became an extremely important ordinance, signifying that the church member confessed their sins and would live a life of a Latter-day Saint. Church members were rebaptized prior to new covenants and ordinances, such as ordination to a new office of the priesthood, receiving temple ordinances, getting married, or entering plural marriage. In an 1881 letter from apostle Joseph F. Smith, he states, \\"Will you please notify the Bishops in your Stake that all persons whose first baptisms have not taken place within a very recent period must be re-baptized before they receive their recommends to pass through the House of the Lord.\\"Devory Scott Anderson, \\"Development of LDS Temple Worship, 1846-2000: A Documentary History\\" Signature Books 2011 In addition to acting as a sign of repentance and recommitment, rebaptism was also seen as a healing ordinance frequently practiced in the temple as such until around 1922 when the First Presidency issued a letter stating that \\"baptizing for health is no part of temple work, and therefore to permit it to become a practice would be an innovation, detrimental to temple work, and a departure as well from the practice instituted of the Lord for the care and healing of the sick.\\"Thomas G. Alexander \\"Mormonism in Transition\\" University of Illinois Press, 1986, pg 290-291 Rebaptism remains a practice in the LDS Church today, but is practiced only when a previously excommunicated member rejoins the church. In such cases, the wording of the ordinance is identical to that of the first baptismal ordinance.

The rector is Andrey Aleksandrov. International Students  History In 1920 the revolutionary committee and the first congress of Councils of the Chuvash Autonomous district decided to create a university Cheboksary. The question about the creation of the Chuvash State University was raised again in 1958-1959, but even then it could not be done because of many problems connected with the absence of the material base and lack of scientific staff in the republic. The university was formed on 17 August 1967 through a merger of the Volga Branch of the Order of Lenin Moscow Energy Institute and the Historical-Philological Department of the I. Ya.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left- handed pitcher in and from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won two American League pennants and one World Series championship. He also played for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Cleveland Indians. Early years L√≥pez signed as an amateur free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies at just sixteen years old. He made his major league debut in 1963, but after just four appearances, was back in the minors by the end of April. He spent all of the 1964 season with Philadelphia's Triple-A affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts. After the Phillies acquired first baseman Vic Power from the Los Angeles Angels (September 9, 1964), L√≥pez was selected as the ‚Äúplayer to be named later,‚Äù the following month. California Angels In 1965, L√≥pez went 14‚Äì13 with a 2.93 earned run average and 122 strikeouts for the Angels to finish second to Curt Blefary in American League rookie of the year balloting. His numbers fell off considerably in 1966, largely because he led AL starters in hit batsmen with nine, and was second in the league with twelve wild pitches (the Chicago White Sox's Joe Horlen had 14). Shoulder injuries limited L√≥pez to just nine innings for the Angels in 1967. On June 15, he and minor leaguer Tom Arruda were sent to the Baltimore Orioles for Woodie Held. Baltimore Orioles L√≥pez spent all of 1968 in the minors before making his first major league appearance with the Orioles in 1969. At this point in his career, he was converted into a reliever, and was 4‚Äì2 with a 4.06 ERA out of the bullpen (he was 1‚Äì1 with a 5.40 ERA in his four starts). The Orioles ran away with the American League East by nineteen games over the Detroit Tigers. L√≥pez's only appearance in the 1969 American League Championship Series came in game one. In the twelfth inning, he faced four batters, retiring only one before manager Earl Weaver removed him in favor of Dick Hall. He did not make an appearance in the 1969 World Series against the New York Mets. L√≥pez became one of the most reliable relievers in Baltimore's bullpen in 1970, as he had a 1.65 ERA in relief. He was 1‚Äì0 with a 3.18 ERA as a starter. Baltimore returned to the post-season, and again, L√≥pez made just one appearance. In the second game of the 1970 World Series, he faced just one batter, Bobby Tolan, and got him to fly out to Brooks Robinson in foul territory. Milwaukee Brewers During spring training the following season, L√≥pez was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roric Harrison and minor leaguer Marion Jackson. He began the 1971 season as a reliever, but was added to the starting rotation midway through the season. He had a 1‚Äì5 record as a starter. Retirement L√≥pez's contract was purchased by the Cleveland Indians during spring training 1972. After spending the entire season with Cleveland's Triple-A affiliate, the Portland Beavers, L√≥pez made four appearances with the Indians that September. He played minor league ball for the San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates and Houston Astros before retiring. He died in 2001 at age 58.

Dickson. It was first published in Astounding: The John W Campbell Memorial Anthology. The story is part of the incomplete Dorsai cycle. Synopsis The story is set in the city of Blauvain, capital of the planet St Marie. It's narrated by Tomas Velt, a Blauvain Police Commissioner. After the defeat of invading soldiers from the Friendly worlds, Field Commander Kensie Graeme of the Expeditionary force of Dorsai mercenaries is assassinated by unseen members of an illegal political organization called the Blue Front. Commander Ian Graeme decides that they are still engaged with an enemy, declares martial law in Blauvain and gives orders that all houses in the city be searched by soldiers under his command. Whilst Velt and his police more-or-less ineffectually assist the Dorsai, he also strives to find a way to avoid the search, which could easily result in the deaths of innocent citizens who resist the soldiers. He gets no assistance from the Exotic Padma, whose philosophy does not allow him to interfere in any way, but Padma does believe that somehow Velt is a pivotal character in resolving the situation. Under Padma's influence, Velt now realizes that General Pel Sinjin, commander of the Planetary militia, must be involved in the assassination attempt. He questions Pel, but Pel is unwilling to confess or reveal any information. Velt begs Padma to talk to Pel and explain why he must give the information. Padma agrees to do so and the talk causes Pel to find peace within himself. He reveals what he knows, including the probable location of the conspirators. With only minutes before the house-to-house search is to begin, Graeme and Velt arrive at the room where the assassins are holed up. The refuse to surrender and Graeme asks to simply come in and talk to them. He does so, unarmed and naked, but still manages to kill them all. With this act, he has displaced the soldier's anger at Kensie's death, honour has been satisfied, and the Dorsai reputation remains unsullied. The search is called off.

The award invites anyone to nominate a health care professional for exceptional service, sacrifice or innovation. The award is named after Cherokee Uniforms, a designer, manufacturer and distributor of uniforms, scrubs and lab coats worn by health care, dental and veterinary professionals internationally.  History  Cherokee Uniforms created the award in 2003 to increase national awareness of health care professionals who serve patients, co-workers and communities in ways that would be considered exceptional by the general public and health care industry. In its inaugural year, the award was bestowed on ten health care professionals: a nurse practitioner and nine registered nurses. In 2003, 526 persons were nominated. In 2007, 1,019 persons were nominated. Since its inception in 2003, 5,400 health care professionals and student nurses have been nominated for the award.  Notable recipients  *2003 - Mona Counts, PhD, CRNP, FNAP, FAANP, a recipient of the inaugural 2003 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award, was honored for taking out a second mortgage on her home to fund the creation of a clinic (the Mt. Morris Primary Care Clinic) to serve the general health care needs of the 5,000 Appalachian residents in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Nurse practitioners provide most of the health care services at the rural clinic under the direction of Counts, a nurse practitioner and the Elouise Ross Eberly Professor of Nursing at the Pennsylvania State University School of Nursing.2 In July 2004, Reader's Digest profiled Counts as an ‚ÄúEveryday Hero‚Äù, which features ‚Äúordinary citizens who perform extraordinary acts at great personal risk or sacrifice.‚Äù3 In 2004, Counts was elected to serve a two-year term as President-Elect of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, from 2005 through 2007. Counts was featured in A Nurse I Am, a two-film project, produced in 2006 for nurses and nursing students, funded by Cherokee Uniforms. *2003 - Mandy Larson, RN, a recipient of the 2003 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award, nearly lost her life as a Good Samaritan. Following her shift as a clinical nurse specialist in the neonatal intensive care unit at Medical University of South Carolina‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital, Larson was visiting her husband at the hospital-based ambulance service when an accident occurred nearby. When they ran to help, the uninjured motorist aimed a handgun at Larson and fired five times. Bullets hit her in the hip, arm and shoulder. She lost two liters of blood and credited her husband, an EMT, with saving her life. A hospital flight nurse and a police officer died of gunshot wounds. Following numerous surgeries, she returned to work. *2004 - Susan Fleming, RN, was a recipient of a 2004 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award. After four years as a nursing aide, Fleming applied to nursing school. A prosthesis took the place of her left hand and allowed her to accomplish most tasks without assistance. Susan is earning a master‚Äôs degree in nursing while working as a nurse in the Pacific Northwest. Susan advocates for nurses with disabilities as a board member of the non- profit ExceptionalNurse.com.(Organization's website) *2005 - Michelle Hokanson, was studying to become a nurse when she received a Grand Prize in the 2005 Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award for an honor‚Äôs project at Montgomery College, in Conroe, Texas. After learning that all cultures do not express pain in the same manner, she developed two pain-assessment scales to help nurses accurately understand and manage patients‚Äô pain: one for Hispanic females, another for African-American males. The scale uses photographs of people whose body language expresses physical pain. The project received the college's top award, and Hokanson maintained a 4.0 GPA in nursing courses while also working full-time at a local hospital and volunteered in a hospice.  About the Award  The award is offered annually. Nominations are submitted by entering the names and occupational-specific information about the nominee into the award-nomination process via electronic or paper nomination forms which are hosted on the award's website. The nomination period is from March 1 through May 31, and recipients are announced on the award's website and in the U.S. media in late September.1 The award has five nomination categories: advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses/ licensed practical nurses, students who are enrolled in schools of nursing, and other non-physician, clinical, health care professionals who work directly with patients. Recipients may be chosen in each nomination category. The number of recipients chosen in a given year depends on the quality of nominations that are submitted. In 2006, there were eleven recipients: two advanced practice nurses, four registered nurses, two licensed vocational nurses/ licensed practical nurses, two nursing students, and one non-physician health care professional. There are three levels of prize winners: grand prize winners, top national winners and national winners. Typically, there is one grand prize winner and one top national winner in each nomination category. The number of national winners in each category depends on the quality of the nominations received.  Award Features  Recipients of each year's Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award appear in the following year's calendar, distributed to schools of nursing, professional associations and health care employers, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The calendars also are distributed through retailers who sell health care uniforms. Calendars include a photography portrait of each of the preceding year's recipients, an inspirational quotation, and health care professional awareness and recognition days and weeks. Calendars are free of charge. Cherokee promotes the recipients of the Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award in the national media, to media serving the health care professions, and to media serving each recipient's geographic areas. Media coverage of the awards has appeared in Nurseweek, Nursing Spectrum, Advance For Nurses, Advance For LPNs, Advance For Nurse Practitioners, Advance For Physical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants, the Baltimore Sun, and Reader's Digest. Health care associations, state and specialty nurses associations, and associations of other kinds of professional and educational associations promote the award to members in member communications vehicles and on their websites.  Judging Process  A panel of nurse leaders, Cherokee management personnel, and former award recipients choose recipients who best meet the program's key requirements of exceptional service, sacrifice and innovation.  Prizes  The grand prize winner in each nomination category receives an all-expense-paid Caribbean cruise for two. Additional winners in each category receive all-expense-paid trips to a medical conference of each winner's choice, an annual membership to their preferred clinical association and a donation of $500 to the nonprofit organization of their choice. Every award winner receives a trophy, Cherokee medical uniforms and Rockers Footwear worth more than $1,000 (if purchased from a retailer), a gold Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award insignia pin, and a profile in a nationally distributed calendar. Those who nominate the grand prize winner in each category receive Cherokee medical uniforms and a donation of $500 to the nonprofit organization of their choice.  A NURSE I AM   An Inspirational Film  Alarmed at the disturbing number of nurses leaving the profession within their first few years in practice, Cherokee Uniforms provided a grant to Emmy Award and Peabody Award-winning director David Hoffman to create a film for nurses and nursing students that would encourage, inspire and instruct. Hoffman completed two films with the same title: A Nurse I Am.4 One, a 32-minute educational film, features four former recipients of the Cherokee Inspired Comfort Award as role models who adhere to accepted nursing practices and who exhibit compassion and commitment toward patients. The film follows the nurses as they treat patients and provide recommendations on how to survive and succeed in the nursing profession. The educational version of the film was created as a tool for instructors to use in classrooms in schools of nursing and includes a classroom discussion guide for instructors. This version of the film received endorsements from the Ohio Nurses Association, the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses, the American Assembly for Men in Nursing, Nurses House, Inc., and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. (The endorsements are printed on the cover insert of the DVD containing only the educational version.) More than 100 schools of nursing in the U.S. use the educational version of the film as part of their teaching curricula. These include the schools of nursing at Yale University, Michigan State University, Indiana State University, University of Texas, North Dakota State University, New Mexico State University, Seattle Pacific University, University of Alabama, University of Alaska, and University of Washington.(film website) A second film, a 62-minute documentary with the same title, follows the personal and professional lives of three of the nurses featured in the educational version. The documentary reveals what motivates these nurses to pursue excellence despite difficult challenges and shows how these nurses maintain personal balance within careers filled with high pressure and disappointments.  A NURSE I AM Scholarship  Cherokee Uniforms established the A Nurse I Am Scholarship Program in 2006, and the first 10 winners were awarded $2,000 checks in 2007. Applicants were required to watch either version of the film A Nurse I Am and to submit an essay describing what the film meant to them.

The band has released two albums in a twenty-year career and have chosen to be independent all that time. Biography Pavor was founded in 1987 near Bonn, Germany, by guitarists Armin Rave and Holger Seebens. Efforts to increase professionality led to three changes in the early line-up, and quickly Michael Pelkowsky (drums), Rainer Landfermann (bass), and Claudius Schwartz (vocals) were regular members. The band's desire for high quality in all matters resulted in the delay of a first official release. Finally, during the winter of 1992/1993, 28 minutes of music were recorded and released some months later as an untitled tape EP, which was soon sold out and is no longer available today. After a year of composing and gigging, Pavor re-entered the studio during May/June/July 1994 to record their first full-length album, A Pale Debilitating Autumn. Shortly after the album's release, guitarist Holger Seebens left the band, and Pavor continued as a four-piece. During 1995 and 1996, Pavor promoted the album with interviews and shows, and started preparing for the next album. However, organizational problems resulting from the jobs of some members led to a partial withdrawal from public relations work and the public in general during the following years. The band made brief appearances in the media. In February 2000, German metal magazine RockHard featured Pavor with an interview and the track \\"Perplexer: Perdition Projectile\\" on its annual \\"best unsigned acts\\" compilation \\"Unerh√∂rt!\\". In June 2000, Pavor won the underground-contest held by Heavy Oder Was?!-magazine, and played the renowned Bang Your Head Festival in Balingen, Germany, as a result. In the year 2003, Pavor finished the recordings of their second album, Furioso. Among the album's eight songs is a re-recorded version of the Pavor classic \\"Crucified Hopes,\\" which was composed back in 1989. The lyrics of the track \\"Dilettante's Dilemma,\\" a song written by Landfermann in 2000, suggest in a self-deprecating tone (the speaker almost mocks himself as a \\"dilettante\\" and an \\"ungifted man\\") the reason for the band's low output over the years and their quest for perfection. At the same time, the speaker confirms, or tries to convince himself of, the quality of the result: \\"Hundreds of thousands / Well-defined operands in an intricate equation / Perfect conciseness / A fulminant contrivance pushing brilliance to its apex.\\" The dilemma, then, is the attempt at perfection in an imperfect world, imperfect first because of \\"ailing objectors,\\" and second because of the inherent doubt of man (\\"ungifted man\\") in his own capability.

Biography Gwilym Prys Davies was born in the village of Llanegryn, in Meirionnydd, Wales. He served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, on North Atlantic Convoys. After the war was over, he went to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth to study law. This is where he met Llinos Evans, to whom he would be married for over fifty years until her death in 2010. By 1956 he had qualified as a solicitor and was working at a legal practice in Pontypridd, pioneering the use of the Welsh language in the courts. His political career started with Plaid Cymru, before he moved to Labour after the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement, of which he was a founder and strong supporter, failed to influence party policy. He also believed that change could be better made by working within a larger, less nationalistic, party that was in power, rather than a smaller, more nationalistic, party that was not in power. He was always a strong advocate of devolution for Wales. He was the Labour candidate in the 1966 Carmarthen by-election but lost to the first Plaid Cymru member to be a member of parliament, a historic event in Welsh politics. He went on to support devolutionsists within the Labour Party with the aim of securing \\"political responsibility for Welsh life\\". He became a member of the Welsh Hospitals' Board and ensured that the parents of the victims of the 1966 Aberfan disaster were represented in courts by Desmond Ackner QC, a well- renowned and able barrister. After John Morris, now Lord Morris of Aberavon, was appointed Secretary of State for Wales, he appointed Gwilym Prys Davies as his special advisor. He was appointed an Officer of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (OStJ) in 1969. He was appointed as a life peer in 1982, and was the first member of the House of Lords to take his oath in Welsh. Before becoming a peer he changed his name from Gwilym Prys Davies to Gwilym Prys Prys-Davies by Deed Poll to enable him to take the title Baron Prys-Davies, of Llanegryn in the County of Gwynedd. The intention of the change was to keep the name Prys, which was said to be due his being to a distant relation of the clergyman and poet Edmund Prys (1542/3 ‚Äì 1623). In the Lords, he was opposition frontbench spokesperson for Health between 1983 and 1987, for Northern Ireland between 1982 and 1993 and for the Welsh Office between 1987 and 1997. He retired from the House of Lords on 23 May 2015.http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/retired-lords/ Retired members of the House of Lords  External Links  Gwilym Prys-Davies Papers at the National Library of Wales References Sources *Parliament.uk Biography *Hansard *BBC News Obituary * Category:1923 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Welsh republicans Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:People from Gwynedd Category:Welsh Labour politicians Category:Officers of the Order of St John Category:Royal Navy sailors Category:Plaid Cymru politicians ","title":"Gwilym Prys Davies, Baron Prys-Davies"},{"id":"12438132","text":"Michael Ristow (b April 24, 1967) is a German medical researcher who has published influential articles on biochemical aspects of mitochondrial metabolism and particularly the possibly health-promoting role of reactive oxygen species in diseases like type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer, as well as general aging due to a process called mitohormesis. Ristow was born in L√ºbeck in the North of Germany. He graduated at the University of Bochum in 1992 and received his M.D. from University of Bochum in 1996. He was appointed to the University of Jena in 2005 as a full professor in nutritional science, and is a full professor in energy metabolism at the ETH Zurich since 2013. In 2007, Ristow‚Äôs group published evidence which could explain the basis of the observed extension of lifespan by restriction of sugar intake. In experiments on a model organism, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, they found that lowering the availability of glucose extended the lifespan of the worms. It has been known since the 1930s that restricting calories while maintaining adequate amounts of other nutrients extends lifespan across a broad range of organisms. The mechanism has been proposed as a change in the activity of the sirtuins. Michael Ristow shows in his article that this effect can also occur independent of sirtuins, since worms deficient for sirtuins still show extended life span in states of sugar restriction.\\"Reuters\\" article on Ristow‚Äôs findings on the positive role of oxidative stress\\"Eurekalert\\" article on Ristow‚Äôs findings on the positive role of oxidative stress Most importantly, Ristow's research suggests that this is a mitohormetic effect, as reviewed in. Hormesis is a controversial concept in which it has been demonstrated that the induction of low-level stress can promote health and lengthen lifespan in some species, while higher levels of the same stress exert detrimental effects. Ristow's interpretation was that in response to a decrease in glycolytic energy production, the worms have to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species. Due to a vaccination-like response, the organism produces more defenses against oxidative stress, including increased activity of catalase. Supplementation with antioxidants abolishes the increase in lifespan, and so does disruption of an AMP-kinase but not disruption of sirtuins. In a follow-up study that experienced significant media attention,Antioxidants & exercise: New York TimesAntioxidants & exercise: BBCAntioxidants & exercise: Scientific American Ristow and colleagues have shown that supplementing humans with antioxidants during physical exercise blocks the health-promoting effects of exercise, suggesting that free radicals produced during exercise are responsible and required for the effects of exercise. These findings bring into question Denham Harman's free radical theory of aging, and provide a mechanistic basis to question the application of antioxidants to human health. Subsequently Ristow demonstrated that the widely used supplement glucosamine promotes longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans and elderly mice. Independently, it was shown that regular intake of glucosamine is associated with a remarkable reduction in mortality in humans, suggesting that glucosamine supplementation may be useful to promote human healthspan. In earlier years, Ristow published a seminal article describing a genetic mutation associated with extreme human obesity. Ristow‚Äôs laboratory has provided direct evidence supporting the so-called Warburg hypothesis. Specifically Ristow has shown that forced metabolic activity and respiration of mitochondria efficiently blocks cancer growth as anticipated by Otto Heinrich Warburg as early as in 1924. Independent of his work on oxidative stress, Ristow has recently shown that increased concentrations of the trace metal Lithium contained in drinking water are associated with increased lifespan in Japan suggesting a readily available anti-aging intervention.

Enric Morera i Viura (; 22 May 1865 - 11 March 1942), was a Spanish musician and composer from Catalonia. Morera was born in Barcelona but moved with his father, a musician, to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1867, studying organ, trumpet, and violin there. He returned in 1883 to Barcelona, studying with Isaac Alb√©niz and Felip Pedrell. Later he lived for two years in Brussels before returning to Argentina. He finally returned to Barcelona in 1890 where he was prominent in the movement Catalan Musical Modernism, with for example the opera La Fada (The Fairy) in 1897. He founded the choir \\"Catalunya Nova\\". He wrote books on musical theory such as a \\"Practical Treatise on Harmony\\". Among his students were Vicente Asencio, Agusti Grau, Manuel Infante, Xavier Montsalvatge and Carlos Surinach. His music is generally strongly nationalist in character, and much forms part of the repertory of Catalan national compositions. He wrote more than 800 compositions. Included are songs, a Requiem Mass, lyric works, symphonic works, operas, symphonic poems, and sardanes for cobla. Although he spent some time in Argentina and Belgium, Morera spent most of his life in Barcelona, and died there in 1942.

It was the directorial debut for Chen Kaige. The film's notable cinematography is by Zhang Yimou. At the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards ceremony on 27 March 2005, a list of 100 Best Chinese Motion Pictures was tallied, and Yellow Earth came in fourth. The film was produced by Guangxi Film Studio (). Zhang Yimou, a colleague of Chen, photographed the film. Richard James Havis, author of Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige, said that the film was the first Chinese film \\"at least since the 1949 Communist Liberation, to tell a story through images rather than dialog.\\" Therefore, the film attracted controversy in China. Havis added that the film \\"was also equivocal about the Communist Party's ability to help the peasants during the Communist revolution\\", a position which differed from that espoused by the propaganda films that were produced after 1949.\\" Background Yellow Earth is set in Shaanbei, located in the northern part of Shaanxi province in the northwest of China, in early spring 1939. The Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang have stopped fighting one another and are working together to overwhelm the invading Japanese. The provinces are divided into Kuomintang-controlled areas and Communist-controlled areas. Shaanxi is divided into three sections: the northern and southern parts are controlled by the Kuomintang, and the middle by the Communists. Because of their co-operation, navigation between the areas is permitted. Plot Gu Qing, a soldier from the propaganda department of the CCP Eighth Route Army in CCP-controlled Shaanxi, travels alone from Yan'an to the northern KMT-controlled area of Shaanxi, Shanbei, with the task of collecting the peasants' folk songs in order to re-write them with communist lyrics in order to boost the morale of the Eighth Route Army soldiers. Yellow Earth begins with a scene depicting a communist soldier walking several miles. He reaches a small village where he is assigned to live with a poor family with the task of recording local folk songs for use in the army later. He learns the hardships of peasant life and especially of that of a peasant girl named Cuiqiao. The story then focuses on the girl, who at only age 14 is forced to marry a significantly older man as her wedding dowry was used to pay for her mother's funeral and brother's engagement. The Communist soldier, called \\"Brother Gu\\", attempts to dissuade Cuiqiao from running off and joining the CCP, but recognizes her despair. After her marriage, Cuiqiao crosses the Yellow River at night but it is unclear whether she made it or not. The story then fast forwards to a rain dance being performed by the villagers, as the land has dried up and peoples' crops have died. Reception Richard James Havis, author of Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige, said that the film \\"immediately brought attention to\\" the \\"Fifth Generation\\" of Chinese filmmakers\\". The film's international premiere occurred in the 1985 Hong Kong International Film Festival. Havis said that the film \\"proved a sensation\\" there.

L. buchneri is a heterofermentative bacteria that produces lactic acid and acetic acid during fermentation. It is used as a bacterial inoculant to improve the aerobic stability of silage. These bacteria are inoculated and used for preventing heating and spoilage after exposure to air. Characteristics Lactobacillus buchneri is a part of the Lactobacillaceae bacteria family. The genus of the bacteria is Lactobacillus and the species is Lactobacillus buchneri. History E.B.Fred, W.H. Peterson, and J.A. Anderson initially discovered the entire Lactobacillus species in 1921 and the species was categorized based on the ability to metabolize certain carbon and sugars. This early study showed that this can produce acetic acid, carbon dioxide and large amounts of mannitol. Mannitol which is another carbon source that can be used to produce lactic acid.FRED, E.B., PETERSON,W.H., AND Anderson, J. A., J.Biol. Chem., 48, 385 (1921). Research L. buchneri are sensitive to low heat and are slow growing. Lactic acid is converted to two most common products which are acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol. Higher concentrations of acetic acid are produced rather than 1,2-propanediol. They both are more effective at reducing the growth of mold and yeast than lactic acid. Strains of L. buchneri may be found in wine since it involves growth of lactic acid bacteria for malolactic fermentation. For this reason winemakers are encouraged to inoculate some malolactic starters to replace indigenous microflora. Growth Growth in L. buchneri inoculants occur at 37 ¬∞C. Treatment Although it is not recommended to treat Lactobacillus infections, penicillin is the most common treatment for these infections. Prevention Use fermented substances sparingly or inoculate L. buchneri with fermented substances. Usage L. buchneri is most beneficial in places where aerobic instability is expected. For instance, high moisture corn is susceptible to spoilage when exposed to air, and for this reason L. buchneri inoculants may benefit. They also may benefit in situations where corn silage is expected to be transferred from one silo to another. Products There are many strains of L. buchneri and they are not all necessarily equally effective. Wyeast has a liquid form of L. buchneri used for the making of beer. Biosafety level Appropriate safety procedures should always be used with this material. This is a level 1 organism. Suitable for handling microbes that do not cause disease in a healthy human. precautions: hand washing with antibacterial soap and washing surfaces with disinfectants after use. Conclusion L. buchneri inoculants should only be used when heating cannot be controlled through management. See also *Fermentation (biochemistry) *lactic acid bacteria References *Driehuis, F., W. J.

Retrieved 12 April 2013 Frawley was recruited from the North Ballarat Rebels in the TAC Cup following from his junior ranks at the East Ballarat Junior Football Netbal Club in the Ballarat Football Netball League. He was taken by the Melbourne Demons with their first round pick (12th overall) in the 2006 AFL Draft. He is the nephew of former St Kilda captain, Danny Frawley.

He played nine senior games in first year of AFL football. Not known for his kicking efficiency, Frawley has a tough and uncompromising defensive style of play. The 2010 season was a breakout year for Frawley who, at still only 21 years of age, became one of the premier defenders in the league. His season was capped off by being named in the back pocket for the 2010 All- Australian squad and finishing second to Brad Green in Melbourne's Best and Fairest. Coming off his breakthrough season in 2010, Frawley's 2011 season started with a setback as he was sidelined for up to three months after tearing his pectoral muscle in January. In 2014, under the new coaching structure of Paul Roos, Frawley began to play more of a forward role. His defensive efforts inside Melbourne's forward 50 was a contributing factor towards their on-field improvement. Hawthorn (2015‚Äì2020) On 6 October 2014, Frawley exercised his rights as a free agent and joined the Hawthorn Football Club.http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2014-10-06/finals-success- lures-frawley-to-hawks Frawley was to play under his eighth coach, three of which were caretaker coaches.Mastermind season review: Hawthorn, The Roar, 9 October 2014 He featured in the club's premiership winning team at the end of the season and played an instrumental role in the victory, keeping Coleman Medallist Josh Kennedy goalless for the entire match.

In 1974, Dennis Jenks merged his business with Paterson to form Paterson Jenks plc. In 1984, Paterson Jenks plc was bought by McCormick & Company. McCormick UK Ltd assimilated Paterson Jenks into the Schwartz brand. Camp is now produced in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Description The current ingredients of Camp Chicory & Coffee are sugar, water, chicory extract (25%) and dried coffee extract (4%). Camp is a dark brown, syrupy liquid. It has a smooth flavour of chicory and coffee but with a very sweet, predominantly chicory aftertaste. Camp is generally used as a substitute for coffee, by mixing with hot water or with warm milk in much the same way as cocoa, or added to cold milk and ice to make iced coffee. It is commonly found in the baking aisles of supermarkets because it is also used as an ingredient in coffee cakes and other confectionery. History A Camp Coffee poster among other advertisements on a tenement building in 1929 Camp Coffee was created in 1885 by Campbell Paterson (1851-1927) of R. Paterson & Son in Glasgow. The company specialised in cordials, and their best-selling product was a raspberry cordial often added to whisky or brandy to create a drink known as \\"Cuddle-me-Dearie\\". The coffee essence was developed by Campbell Paterson for domestic use, to avoid the complex and then expensive equipment required for coffee drinking.Made in Scotland: Camp Coffee - Carol Foreman Legend has it (mainly due to the picture on the label) that Camp Coffee was originally developed as an instant coffee, a means of creating coffee quickly for military purposes. The label is classical in tone, drawing on the romance of the British Raj. It includes a drawing of a seated Gordon Highlander (supposedly Major General Sir Hector MacDonald) being served by a Sikh soldier holding a tray with a bottle of essence and jug of hot water. They are in front of a tent, at the apex of which flies a flag bearing the drink's slogan, \\"Ready Aye Ready\\". That was also the motto of the 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force) of the British Indian Army. In this context, the Scots word 'aye' has the meaning of 'always' rather than 'yes', and indicates, in the case of the drink, that it is 'always ready' to be made. The original label, by William Victor Wrigglesworth, depicted a Sikh servant waiting on a seated Scottish soldier. A feature of this label was that the server carried a tray on which there was a bottle of Camp Coffee, which carried the same label showing a bottle of Camp Coffee and so on into infinity. A later version of the label, introduced in the mid-20th century, removed the tray from the picture, thus removing the infinite bottles element (the Droste effect), and was seen as an attempt to avoid the connotation that the Sikh was a servant, although he was still shown waiting while the kilted Scottish soldier sipped his coffee. The current version, introduced in 2006, depicts the Sikh as a soldier, now sitting beside the Scottish soldier, and with a cup and saucer of his own. Popularity Camp Coffee is an item of British nostalgia, because many remember it from their childhood. It is still a popular ingredient for home bakers making coffee-flavoured cake and coffee-flavoured buttercream. In late 1975, Camp Coffee temporarily became a popular alternative to instant coffee in the UK, after the price of coffee doubled due to shortages caused by heavy frosts in Brazil.

Plot Running from Tom, Jerry loses him in a traveling circus where he finds a female elephant with a golden tack on its foot, crying. Jerry thinks of a plan to remove a golden tack stuck on the elephant's foot, and Tom watches the elephant crying with an evil smile. Jerry removes the golden tack from the elephant's foot and at first she is scared. However, when she notices Jerry holding up the golden tack which he removed off her foot, she is overjoyed. Jerry wins the affections of the elephant as she picks him up with her trunk and hugs him in gratitude. Tom on the other hand, manages to make enemies with the elephant by climbing up a ladder and trying to take the mouse from her. The elephant uses her trunk to grab Jerry and places him safely on her head. Turning her attention back to Tom, the elephant smack him underground. She continues hugging the mouse and Tom climbs out of the hole before fainting. Annoyed, Tom watches the clowns walk by until he sees Jerry in a miniature clown outfit. He spies on both the mouse and elephant as they perform a circus dance, passing a ball back and forth. Tom bursts the ball with a slingshot. The elephant looks for her friend in concern while Tom ascends a high-rise ladder to reach the mouse, who is hanging onto the high wire by his feet. Tom walks across the wire and stomps on it repeatedly, bouncing Jerry into his hands. He walks over the wire back to the ramp only to run into the irate elephant. She uses her weight to pull the wire and both of them all the way down to the ground. She suctions the mouse into her trunk and releases the cat, launching him out of the circus tent. Later, Tom chases Jerry up a tall ladder to a diving board. Jerry dives, and Tom soon follows him. The elephant drinks down the water with her trunk and saves Jerry. Relived, she kisses him and leaves. Tom crashes through the ground with such force he falls all the way into hell. An irate devil takes him back up to the surface and throws him out using his trident, as if telling him don't come back. He goes back into Hell in peace. The elephant plays with Jerry. Tom shakes pepper into the elephant's nose, causing a gigantic sneeze that shoots Jerry miles from the circus. Tom runs backwards with a baseball glove to catch the mouse, but somehow the elephant is behind Tom. He runs up the elephant's leg and readies to catch the mouse. However, she has other plans and in anger lowers her trunk down to confront Tom again. Realizing too late he is in trouble, the elephant throws Tom off and catches the glove and then catches Jerry. She hugs the mouse. Leading the circus parade together, Jerry plays the bugle and the elephant plays a very loud drum. Tom hides in a manhole to set a trap with dynamite that will explode when the elephant stomps on the switch. However, the stomping bounces the dynamite back with Tom as he unwittingly closes the manhole, without him even realizing it. The elephant steps on the switch and Tom explodes. The defeated cat waves a \\"The End\\" white flag as the elephant stops temporarily to kick some dust up near the manhole.

It has increasingly expanded to include not only local indie music acts, but also popular Australian headliners. History Starting in 1974 as an event to rival another dorm's social activities, Village Fair consisted of a Ferris wheel, giant slides, stalls, and theme-based dorm common rooms. Students of CSU (at that time, a Teacher's College) volunteered to organize the activities. The name originates from where the Fair was originally held; on John Oxley Village Green, where John Oxley Village (JOV) is an on-campus Residence, hence Village Fair. The event became a part of the local community's event calendar, and for many years it was preceded by a student parade through the streets of Bathurst on the morning of the Fair. Each 'Hut' - one of the 10 dormitory buildings that collectively make up JOV - was made responsible for devising and operating a stall or event for the Fair. Over time, it became obvious that one of the most popular stalls was the International Beer Tent run by D and E Huts. By the mid-1990s this had become the main focus, combined with a line-up of musical entertainments to keep the drinkers happy. Twenty years after the first event, the Fair took the form of a Music Festival on Saturday, 29 October 1994. 1995 saw Village Fair with an Under The Water theme, aiming to support the State Emergency Service (SES) by donating profits in the aid of upgrading SES equipment. A large loss (negative profits) was incurred in 1997 when the Fair moved from its home on JOV Green to a space near the campus Rugby Oval. As a result, the 1998 Fair had its funding pulled by the University leaving the volunteer group to move the music venue into the University Bar and place the stalls on the Library Lawn. In 1999, the venue again changed to University Hockey Fields, but the day was a washout due to heavy rain. A number of people suffered injuries due to drunken mud-sliding. The Fair moved again to a greenfield site next to the JOV dam, where it has stayed until 2006. 2007 saw the event move to the base of the famous Mt. Panorama. The festival site is now more than double any previous site that has hosted Village Fair. The increasing popularity of the event saw more than 2000 people attend 2011's Village Fair, which was headlined by Sparkadia and supporting acts Papa Vs Pretty, DJ Sampology, Ball Park Music, Bang Gang Deejays, and Owl Eyes.Pickford, Katie (2011) \\"Sparkadia headlining Village Fair\\", The Western Advocate, 24 September 2011 There was no Village Fair in 2020. Artist lineups Village Fair has attracted a number of popular upcoming Australian artists, most of which have gone on to have mainstream music careers, including Machine Gun Fellatio, Blue King Brown, The Basics, Ash Grunwald, Chaos Maths, Something for Kate, 28 Days, Kisschasy, Blue Juice, British India and Little Birdy. The line-up has also featured several well-known DJs, including The Aston Shuffle, Bag Raiders, The Funky Punks, and The Purple Sneakers DJs. 2009 saw the event take a more mainstream direction in what was the biggest Village Fair to date. That year the line-up included Van She, Kid Confucius, Snob Scrilla, Cloud Control, Bag Raiders, The Bakery, The Sundance Kids, True Vibenation, Girl In The Red Light, and local CSU talent Horse & Lewi, Boylo & Will, and Go!

Its picturesque setting, already perpetuated by the native poet Adalbert Stifter (1805‚Äì1868), makes it a popular destination for daytrippers. Beyond the Lipno reservoir, a densely forested area with several abandoned villages stretches up to the Vltava-Danube drainage divide (part of the main European Watershed) and the border with Austria at a distance of about 7 km (4 mi). History Horn√≠ Plan√° was part of the estates of Zlat√° Koruna Abbey, founded by the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar II in 1263. It was vested with market rights by King Charles IV in 1349. Secularised during the Hussite Wars in 1420, it was incorporated into the Lordship of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, then held by the House of Rosenberg.

The first formal examination was conducted in South Africa under the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1858. In general usage, the school-leaving exams, which are government-administered, are known as the \\"matric exams\\"; by extension, students in the final year of high school (grade 12) are known as \\"matriculants\\". Once the Matric year has been passed, students are said to have \\"matriculated\\". Officially, the qualification obtained at the end of secondary schooling is the National Senior Certificate, and the school-leaving examinations are the \\"Senior Certificate Examinations\\". The National Senior Certificate can be completed through either the Department of Education or the Independent Examination Board. Students who fulfill certain requirements (an achievement rating of 4 (50% - 59%) or better in four (4) designated subjects) in their Senior Certificate results receive a Matriculation Endorsement/Bachelor's Pass on their certificates; this endorsement is the minimum requirement for admission to a bachelor's degree at any South African university, set by the Department of Basic Education. Students applying to a South African university with foreign school qualifications can obtain a \\"Matriculation Exemption\\" to show that they meet the same standards. This multiple meaning can lead to confusion; for example, the statement that a person \\"passed matric\\" or \\"has their matric\\" may mean either that they received a Senior Certificate (i.e. they finished high school) or specifically that they received a Senior Certificate with Matriculation Endorsement (i.e. they are eligible to enter university). South African universities do not set their own entrance examinations, although many use standardized entrance tests of linguistic, numerical and mathematical ability, called the National Benchmark Tests, split into the AQL Test (Academic and Quantitative Literacy) and the Mathematics Test. Before the 1990s, the standard Matric Certificate with Endorsement was worded as \\"Examination result - Passed with full exemption\\". This wording meant that the candidate passed their NSC exams with exemption from entrance exams when applying for University entrance. As of 2005, the new passing standards are Certificate, Diploma, and Bachelor.

Stelfox was a recognised authority on Hymenoptera and on non- marine Mollusca especially the genus Pisidium. He also made important contributions to scientific knowledge concerning Irish botany and on identifying and describing remains from prehistoric sites in Ireland. Early years and education Stelfox was born in Belfast on 15 December 1883 the son of Jennie McIlwaine and James Stelfox. He was educated at Campbell College, Belfast and went on to study architecture in Ireland and England, being elected as an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects on the 2 November 1908. Stelfox was an enthusiastic naturalist from his youth, encouraged by his father, who belonged to the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club and by Robert John Welch with whom he would later collaborate. His earliest known specimens are now held in the National Museums Liverpool and were collected in 1898 when he was 15 years of age. Marriage It was not until 1903 that Stelfox became an official member of the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club and in 1908 he was appointed the Honourable Secretary. In 1909 his future wife Margarita Mitchell was asked to assist him in this role. Mitchell was a talented naturalist in her own right and did valuable work in conjunction with M. W. Rea on Mycetozoa. Stelfox and Mitchell married in 1914. The couple subsequently had three children but sadly their daughter and youngest son died in childhood. Natural History Career Assorted Hymenoptera. Arranged by Julia Suits, photographed by Alex Wild; Produced as part of the Insects Unlocked Project at The University of Texas at Austin. Around 1908, amongst other work, Stelfox assisted with the Clare Island Survey, visiting the Island and the surrounding area on numerous occasions, researching and writing the section of the Survey Report on non-marine mollusks. In 1911 he published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and next year he was elected a member of that Academy. One of Stelfox's most influential papers on Mollusca was on the Pisidium fauna of the Grand Junction Canal which was published in 1918. This was regarded by Arthur Erskine Ellis as having \\"revolutionised the hitherto very unsatisfactory treatment of the genus...\\". However it was not until 1920 that Stelfox was able to make a living from his passion when he obtained employment at the National Museum of Ireland. He was appointed as Assistant Naturalist and specialized in Hymenoptera. Stelfox recognised the enormous value of the Alexander Henry Haliday Hymenoptera collection held at the National Museum of Ireland and undertook the task of curating and caring for it. In doing so he added significantly to the scientific knowledge of many species by ensuring the correct identification and labelling of specimens and the cross referencing of Haliday's notes. Despite this specialization Stelfox proved his standing as a naturalist by publishing papers on a total nine Orders of insects and was regarded as an authority on molluscs, Irish plants and other aspects of natural history. From 1924 Stelfox and his assistant Eugene O'Mahony were solely responsible for the Museum's zoological collections. As a result, he was often called upon to identify remains uncovered from prehistoric sites across Ireland and undertook a serious amount of work that informed scientists of the ecology in Ireland over 1000 years prior. During this time Stelfox also continued to make significant contributions to the scientific knowledge on Irish flora and fauna by describing many new species. In his free time he continued to undertake field trips adding to his significant personal collections of mollusks and insects. Despite his scholarship Stelfox refused offers of Honorary Doctorates but in 1947 was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Linnean Society. In 1948 Stelfox retired from his position at the National Museum of Ireland but continued to undertake numerous field trips and collect plants, molluscs and insects. Stelfox's collections In 1951 he donated his collection of Pisidium molluscs to Rev H. B. Herrington who subsequently gave it to the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan. His enormous collection of over 90,000 specimens of Hymenoptera along with the majority of his field books were donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1966. This collection was regarded by Dr K. V. Krombein as \\"The largest and most complete collection of Irish Hymenoptera ever made\\". Other scientifically and historically significant documents are held by Dr. Michael P. Kerney of the British Museum, Nora Fisher McMillan of the National Museums Liverpool and Stelfox's family. Death Stelfox died in hospital after a short illness on 19 May 1972. Taxa named in Stelfox's honour Several taxa have been named in Stelfox's honour including Heterospilus stelfoxi a species of parasitoid wasp.

Paper 2010-01-1110. This cycle consists of compressing air (with no fuel) to a very high ratio, as is typical in the Diesel cycle. The air is then isolated in a constant volume chamber. Fuel is injected and allowed to combust fully under constant volume conditions, which is how Otto cycle combustion is modeled. Finally, the combustion products are expanded to atmospheric pressure, utilizing the Atkinson cycle. In the Wankel engine, the only successful pistonless rotary engine to date, an oval housing surrounds a triangular rotor. The three operating chambers thus formed are separated by seals installed on the three apexes of the rotor. These seals move in and out during each rotation, and are subjected to high stresses and wear; as a result they have been the limiting factor in longevity of such engines. The LiquidPiston design reverses the shapes: an oval rotor moves within a triangular housing. The required seals (both face and apex) are mounted on the stationary housing, and are lubricated directly. In order to use the Diesel cycle efficiently, high compression ratios are required. Typical piston diesel engines use between 15:1 and 24:1. The projected compression ratio of the LiquidPiston engine is 26:1. Warwick, Graham. Liquid Piston's Rotary Engine Could Revolutionize UAS . .

Mehndi Waley Hath was Syed Noor's unofficial follow up to Choorian and subsequently expectations among the public as well as within the industry were sky high. There had been reports that Noor had been totally wrapped up in the shooting of what was being seen as his special pet project. All other productions he was involved in were receiving a cold shoulder while Noor worked painstakingly on Mehndi Waley Hath. Last summer when the preview trailers were screened they caused mini- hysteria in some centers in the Punjab where audiences demanded them to be replayed over and over! Plot The film begins with a voice over explaining the \\"cause\\" of the filmmakers in attempting to expose a \\"crual custom\\"(as the poster said) that exists in the rural areas of the Punjab where women are married off (illegally) to the Quran so that the landowning family doesn't have to part with any of its wealth. The action is based around the rural haveli of Vadda Saeen - the family elder, and his wife. They live in their sprawling estate together with the extended family that is usually warring with one another. There are also legions of slaves (ghulams) who devote themselves to the Vadda Saeen and show their love for their Saeen by kissing and nuzzling his feet! The house contains two warring \\"bahu's\\", the benign, kindhearted widow Naghma and the Wicked-Super-Dyke-from-Hell Bahar. Naghma has a demented son, Babar Ali who shoots people for fun and a daughter, Saima, an overgrown 35-year-old teenager with an unhealthy pigeon fetish. Problems arise when it is discovered that the family will stand to lose a large segment of their land once Saima is wedded. The family elders, cajoled and abetted by Eyebrow Queen Bahar decide to adopt a plan where Saima is to get married, not to a handsome young prince but to the Holy Book. There are to be no festivities, no joy and little chance of children. Not only that, but she is to wear only white and must live with her husband in a deserted mausoleum! Naturally Saima, expecting marriage to a handsome young pigeon is rather depressed when she is banished to a life on the periphery. Matters start coming to a head when Rana returns from \\"frontline duty\\" to find that the girl of his dreams has been forced to wed the Quran and live in exile. He consults a nearby imam who tells him that such marriages are unrecognized by Islam and are simply an illegal schemes by which families attempt to retain their wealth. So, armed with this information, the hitherto timid Rana decides to take on the almighty family of Vadda Saeen, led by the dangerously psychotic Babar Ali. First off, the movie must be commended for at least making an attempt to tackle a relevant issue in a language most likely to be understood by the masses. The film is also to be commended for avoiding the sleazy element associated with Punjabi movies. Syed Noor plays to the masses but avoids the smutty element quite successfully going for the wholesome style of \\"Choorian\\" instead. The film has some fairly decent tunes to help it along, but the pace starts slowing more and more as we approach the inevitable climax. Saima looks fetching and should be featuring in next years Film Award ceremonies for her acting in this film - yet she looks considerably older than her co-star Moammar Rana. Bahar eats up the screen and dominates as only she can while Nirma, as Babar Ali's trinket doesn't make much impression despite being given a sizzling number to perform. Nirma's future doesn't appear to be too bright. Babar Ali ends up taking most of the acting accolades delivering a menacing performance as the evil brother Mattoo. He ought to forget about taking on romantic leads considering how average (to put it mildly) he looks and would be far better advised to stick to this sort of negative role, which he performed with such distinction here. Mehndi Waley Hath is at least not an outright embarrassment and is somewhat elevated by the \\"message\\" that it attempts to deliver. A feather in director/producer/screenwriter Syed Noor's cap - a rare commodity these days. Film business When the film released, it did excellent business in the initial week or two before settling down for a steady run. The film achieved a six-month Silver Jubilee in many places in Punjab playing in regular shows (3 per day), which was great even if it barely matched the record-breaking success of Choorian. Mehndi Waley Hath was also nominated for 16 awards in 2000. Film song lyrics were written by Aqil Ruby and music by Zulfiqar Ali.

It has appeared on many recordings by the group and lends its name to their debut demo release, Frail, from 1994. The song has never been released as a single. Background \\"Frail\\" was initially the college submission entry for Stephen Mason, guitarist for Jars of Clay. As written by Mason, the song was purely instrumental. After creating Jars of Clay with singer Dan Haseltine and pianist Charlie Lowell, Mason put forward the song to the group. It was then re-recorded for the group's demo, Frail, in 1994, and was chosen as the demo's title track. In 1995, the band recorded their highly successful debut full- length studio album, Jars of Clay. \\"Frail\\" was not chosen to be included on the album, however. Like the song \\"Fade to Grey,\\" it was added to their next studio album, Much Afraid, in 1997. For the re-recording, lyrics were written by the group, which by this time included second guitarist Matt Odmark. This version is considered to be the \\"standard\\" version of the song. In 1999, following the release of the group's third album, If I Left the Zoo, Jars of Clay released a rarities collection named The White Elephant Sessions. This collection included the instrumental version of \\"Frail\\" from the original demo album. Most recently, the band re-recorded the song in 2003 for the studio portion of their 2-disc studio/live album Furthermore: From the Studio, From the Stage. Like most of the studio recordings for the album, \\"Frail\\" was a re- recorded, rearranged version. However, it was the first to change key: All previous recordings of the song have been in E minor, but this version was transposed to the key of G minor. It also contained a very brief introduction unique to this recording. Personnel This personnel section pertains to the Much Afraid version of the song. The personnel may vary from version to version.

At the age of 14, James entered The Thailand Under 18 100cc Veloil Challenge and won its championship. He then later entered the Thailand Nationals in the Yamaha class and won 2 out of 4 races with podiums in the other 2. He continued to enter kart races with the 2003 kart, and still managed to finish the season 4th in the internationally recognized Intercon ‚ÄòA‚Äô Class. James finished on the podium in every race he entered. 2004 Towards the end of 2004, James had an opportunity of a test drive with AIM Racing, one of Thailand‚Äôs leading racing teams. He passed with flying colors as the fastest rookie ever to take the test. He was immediately entered for the last two races of 2004 as a guest driver. He drove a specially designed Thai built car that ran with 12 valve, 1600cc, Toyota racing engines that produces top speeds of up to 160 km/h. He competed in 4 out of 6 races in the new season, finishing first twice and had a podium place in the rest. In December 2004, James was invited for a test drive in a Formula BMW, with the Meritus Racing Team in Malaysia. Again he passed the test and was offered a drive with them in 2005. He entered the Formula BMW scholarship programme and missed out by one place for the scholarship. James and his sponsors decided to concentrate on karting in Thailand. 2004-2006 Grunwell won all the races in Thailand Rotax Max Junior series. He later entered the World Finals in Langkawi for Rotax Max. In Langkawi, James finished in the top 5 in all races and started 4th on the grid in the final. He was the highest placed Thai driver ever. At the end of 2005, James again joined the Formula BMW Asia scholarship program and this time ‚Äì having matured a little and with some more experience ‚Äì passed with flying colors. He won one of 4 prestigious BMW Scholarship prizes worth USD 50,000 and managed to get bonus points for setting the fastest lap out of 20 competitors. In 2006 Meritus Racing Team took James on as a Rookie driver to compete in the Formula BMW Asia series where he finished 3rd in the Rookie Championship and 4th overall. 2007-2008 In 2007 Grunwell spent a second year in Formula BMW Asia for Meritus Racing Team. He finished third in points with three wins among 12 podium finishes. In 2008 Grunwell raced in Formula V6 Asia for Team Meritus and won the championship, capturing four wins and finishing on the podium in all but two of the twelve races. However, despite the 2008 success, Grunwell has not appeared in a professional motor race since that time. Advertising & Sponsorship All through 2005 and 2006, James has been featured in many magazines and newspapers. James also appeared with his Concept Car at the Bangkok 7th Rugby Tournament on behalf of his sponsors Champion Ferodo, where he did a demonstration drive by and helped present the prize to the winners of the tournament. In 2007, The Pizza Company became one of the main sponsors for James in the Formula BMW Asia Series followed by Comcon Services Thailand and Image Makers Asia, and James has been actively promoting both companies in Thailand and abroad.

It is a project of the Bangkok-based Children's Rights Foundation. The small village community cares for over 70 children that were born with HIV and whose parents died of Aids. The organization has no political or religious associations. The children's homes have been built on land donated by a famous monk in the Lopburi province, approximately 230 kilometers north of Bangkok, Thailand. Unlike a state orphanage, BaanGerda has a unique operating model that provides family-style homes for orphans with foster parents looking after the children. All of the parents are HIV positive, thus ensuring they are sensitive to the needs of HIV infected children. It is the only one of its kind in Thailand.  Founders  The founders of BaanGerda are Karl and Tassanee Morsbach, who were originally involved in building schools along the Thai and Burmese border. In total, five schools were built and are now operated by the border police, under the patronage of the King's daughter, Princess Sirindhorn. They turned their attention to the growing problem of Aids orphans and opened the first family home at BaanGerda in 2001. It was built with their own money and the intention was to ease the children's suffering in whatever life they have left. When ARV medicine became available, their focus changed as the children were able to live with the disease and lead a relatively normal life. Over the next five years, several more homes were constructed as they were able to raise funds from within Thailand and abroad. In 2006, Germany honored Karl and Tassanee Morsbach for their humanitarian work by awarding them the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit.  Facilities  As well as the family homes, BaanGerda comprises an infirmary center with six beds, a guesthouse, an administrative building, and an activities building. One of the most important features is called the ‚ÄúKinderstern‚Äù, which is a multi-purpose building used for eating, a reception center for guests and other events. It was built with the financial support from the artwork Kinderstern (Children\`s Star), a social sculpture which stands since 1988 for the Children\`s rights and is made by the German artist Imi Knoebel.  Workshops and vocational training  The recently constructed carpentry and sewing workshops were built to offer the parents a worthwhile job which could boost their confidence and earn them extra money. Many people infected with HIV in Thailand are excluded from jobs, as companies routinely screen potential employees. The production facilities play a vital role in the BaanGerda concept as it provides a vocation for residents and develops their self-esteem. There is also the opportunity for the children to take part in training, which is particularly useful for those that do not attend college later.  Medical  Comprehensive medical treatment is available for all of the adults and children. This includes first and second line ARV medicine and regular blood testing to measure their CD4 count. The nearest hospital is located 35 kilometers from the village so everyday medical requirements are taken care of by the resident staff. The medical team distribute ARV medicine to each house and the parents are responsible for ensuring that their children take it at regulated times. Medical records are meticulously kept for each child including weight changes and lab results.  Education  It is common for children infected with HIV to be excluded from school. However, the children of BaanGerda were fortunate to be accepted at a local school and follow the national standard curriculum. It is part of the King's Project and provides education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Documentary Film  \\"HEAVEN'S MEADOW. THE SMALL WONDERS OF BAAN GERDA\\" is a 90 min. documentary by German film director Detlev F. Neufert. It had its premiere in 2005 in Bangkok and shows the beginnings and the 'wonders' of this Aids-village in Thailand. It combines the personal lives of the children with BAAN GERDA as a model for the world and a greater view into the wheel of life. It has been screened internationally in cinemas, schools and universities and TV, even in Bhutan and in China where some billions saw it in CCTV. Hollywood director Wolfgang Petersen names it \\"a masterpiece\\". \\"DANCING ON HEAVEN'S MEADOW\\". 2009. A 30 min. follow-up by film director Detlev F. Neufert about the life in the Aids orphan village Baan Gerda in Thailand. Ben, one of the leading kids in \\"Heaven's Meadow. The small wonders of Baan Gerda\\" is now 16 years old. How does he face his life as an Aids orphan and how does the development of Baan Gerda can help him and the other children to lead a normal life. The film has been screened in international TV stations. BaanGerda features in the 2010 documentary Living with the Tiger. The film focuses on two of the children over a period of 3 years, and highlights the problems they encounter as they try to re-integrate back into their communities. The story is set in the context of their preparations for an ambitious performance in an opera.

Specifically, it invokes IP fragmentation, a process used to partition messages (the service data unit (SDU); typically a packet) from one layer of a network into multiple smaller payloads that can fit within the lower layer's protocol data unit (PDU). Every network link has a maximum size of messages that may be transmitted, called the maximum transmission unit (MTU). If the SDU plus metadata added at the link layer exceeds the MTU, the SDU must be fragmented. IP fragmentation attacks exploit this process as an attack vector. Part of the TCP/IP suite is the Internet Protocol (IP) which resides at the Internet Layer of this model. IP is responsible for the transmission of packets between network end points. IP includes some features which provide basic measures of fault-tolerance (time to live, checksum), traffic prioritization (type of service) and support for the fragmentation of larger packets into multiple smaller packets (ID field, fragment offset). The support for fragmentation of larger packets provides a protocol allowing routers to fragment a packet into smaller packets when the original packet is too large for the supporting datalink frames. IP fragmentation exploits (attacks) use the fragmentation protocol within IP as an attack vector. According to [Kurose 2013], in one type of IP fragmentation attack \\"the attacker sends a stream of small fragments to the target host, none of which has an offset of zero. The target can collapse as it attempts to rebuild datagrams out of the degenerate packets.\\" Another attack involves sending overlapping fragments with non- aligned offsets, which can render vulnerable operating systems not knowing what to do, causing some to crash.  Process  The fragmentation algorithm in IPv4. IP packets are encapsulated in datalink frames, and, therefore, the link MTU affects larger IP packets and forces them to be split into pieces equal to or smaller than the MTU size. This can be accomplished by several approaches: * To set the IP packet size equal or smaller than the directly attached medium and delegate all further fragmentation of packets to routers, meaning that routers decide if the current packet should be re-fragmented or not. This offloads a lot of work on to routers, and can also result in packets being segmented by several IP routers one after another, resulting in very peculiar fragmentation. * To preview all links between source and destination and select the smallest MTU in this route, assuming there is a unique route. This way we make sure that the fragmentation is done by the sender, using a packet-size smaller than the selected MTU, and there is no further fragmentation en route. This solution, called Path MTU Discovery, allows a sender to fragment/segment a long Internet packet, rather than relying on routers to perform IP-level fragmentation. This is more efficient and more scalable. It is therefore the recommended method in the current Internet. The problem with this approach is that each packet is routed independently; they may well typically follow the same route, but they may not, and so a probe packet to determine fragmentation may follow a path different from paths taken by later packets. Three fields in the IP header are used to implement fragmentation and reassembly.

Field  0  DF  MF  colspan=\\"13\\"  Fragment Offset } Fragment Offset specifies the fragment's position within the original packet, measured in 8-byte units. Accordingly, every fragment except the last must contain a multiple of 8 bytes of data. It is obvious that Fragment Offset can hold 8192 (2^13) units but the packet can't have 8192 * 8 = 65,536 bytes of data because \\"Total Length\\" field of IP header records the total size including the header and data. An IP header is at least 20 bytes long, so the maximum value for \\"Fragment Offset\\" is restricted to 8189, which leaves room for 3 bytes in the last fragment. Because an IP internet can be connectionless, fragments from one packet may be interleaved with those from another at the destination. The \\"Identification field\\" uniquely identifies the fragments of a particular packet. The source system sets \\"Identification\\" field in each packet to a unique value for all packets which use the same source IP address, destination IP address, and \\"Protocol\\" values, for the lifetime of the packet on the internet. This way the destination can distinguish which incoming fragments belong to a unique packet and buffer all of them until the last fragment is received. The last fragment sets the \\"More Fragment\\" bit to 0 and this tells the receiving station to start reassembling the data if all fragments have been received. The following is a real-life fragmentation example: The following was obtained using the Ethereal protocol analyzer to capture ICMP echo request packets.

(66.94.234.13) Data (1480 bytes) \` Note that only the first fragment contains the ICMP header and all remaining fragments are generated without the ICMP header. Two important points here: * In some datalink protocols such as Ethernet, only the first fragment contains the full upper layer header, meaning that other fragments look like beheaded packets. * Additional overhead imposed over network because all fragments contains their own IP header. Additional overhead = (number_of_fragments - 1) * (ip_header_len);  Exploits  ; IP fragment overlapped: The IP fragment overlapped exploit occurs when two fragments contained within the same IP packet have offsets that indicate that they overlap each other in positioning within the packet. This could mean that either fragment A is being completely overwritten by fragment B, or that fragment A is partially being overwritten by fragment B. Some operating systems do not properly handle fragments that overlap in this manner and may throw exceptions or behave in other undesirable ways upon receipt of overlapping fragments. This is the basis for the teardrop attack. Overlapping fragments may also be used in an attempt to bypass Intrusion Detection Systems. In this exploit, part of an attack is sent in fragments along with additional random data; future fragments may overwrite the random data with the remainder of the attack. If the completed packet is not properly reassembled at the IDS, the attack will go undetected. ; IP fragmentation buffer full: The IP fragmentation buffer full exploit occurs when there is an excessive amount of incomplete fragmented traffic detected on the protected network. This could be due to an excessive number of incomplete fragmented packets, a large number of fragments for individual packets or a combination of quantity of incomplete packets and size/number of fragments in each packet. This type of traffic is most likely an attempt to bypass security measures or Intrusion Detection Systems by intentional fragmentation of attack activity. ; IP fragment overrun: The IP Fragment Overrun exploit is when a reassembled fragmented packet exceeds the declared IP data length or the maximum packet length. By definition, no IP packet should be larger than 65,535 bytes. Systems that try to process these large packets can crash, and can be indicative of a denial of service attempt. ; IP fragment too many packets:The \\"Too Many Packets\\" exploit is identified by an excessive number of incomplete fragmented packet detected on the network. This is usually either a denial of service attack or an attempt to bypass security measures. An example of \\"Too Many Packets\\", \\"Incomplete Packet\\" and \\"Fragment Too Small\\" is the Rose Attack. ; IP fragment incomplete packet: This exploit occurs when a packet can not be fully reassembled due to missing data. This can indicate a denial of service attack or an attempt to defeat packet filter security policies. ; IP Fragment Too Small: If an IP fragment is too small it indicates that the fragment is likely intentionally crafted. Any fragment other than the final fragment that is less than 400 bytes could be considered too small. Small fragments may be used in denial of service attacks or in an attempt to bypass security measures or detection.  Fragmentation for evasion  Network infrastructure equipment such as routers, load-balancers, firewalls and IDS have inconsistent visibility into fragmented packets. For example, a device may subject the initial fragment to rigorous inspection and auditing, but might allow all additional fragments to pass unchecked. Some attacks may use this fact to evade detection by placing incriminating payload data in fragments. Devices operating in \\"full\\" proxy mode are generally not susceptible to this subterfuge.

Australian public housing operates within the framework of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, by which funding for public housing is provided by both federal and state governments.The Reluctant Landlords? - A History of Public Housing in Australia According to the 2006 census, Australia's public housing stock consisted of some 304,000 dwellings out of a total housing stock of more than 7.1 million dwellings, or 4.2% of all housing stockTenure Type and Landlord Type by Dwelling Structure - 2006 Census results, Australian Bureau of Statistics (compared with 20% in Denmark, 46% \\"low rent housing\\" in France and 50% public housing in the UK at peak). Construction of new public housing dwellings is currently at its lowest rate for 40 years and existing public housing stock is severely underfunded. There are also moves towards privatisation and transition into community and social housing models. This has led to recent campaigns to save public housing marked for demolition, advocate for upgrades and maintenance and construction of new public housing dwellings, such as the ongoing Bendigo street housing campaign in which homeless people are being housed by community in homes left empty by the Victorian state government. Overview Daceyville, the first purpose-built public housing project in New South Wales.ABC: Verbatim, retrieved 10 February 2011 Public housing in Collingwood, Victoria The state government departments which are responsible for providing public housing have been known by a variety of names due to their history in each state, such as the Office of Housing (Victoria), the Department of Housing (Queensland) and Housing SA (formerly known as the Housing Trust, South Australia). Their official name tends to change with the way each state government prioritises public housing within its departmental structure. For example, for a time in the 1980s, Victoria's public housing had its own department (Department of Planning and Housing). Since the early 1990s, departmental restructuring under the Kennett government relegated its status to the 'Office of Housing' within the Department of Planning and Development. It has since been moved from a 'bricks and mortar' issue to one of health and welfare, now being an office within the Department of Human Services. The management of some public housing has been outsourced to not-for-profit management companies as part of a demand management philosophy to target it towards people with special needs. Dwelling types Australian public housing has traditionally been of two main types - inner-city medium to high-rise apartments, and low-density townhouses or fully detached houses on master-planned estates located on, what were at the time of construction, the suburban fringes of cities and towns. The inner-city public housing is mostly found in Melbourne and Sydney on estates generally comprising 3-5 story walk-up flats and 11-22 story high-rise towers. Since the late 1990s, the Victorian government has embarked on a process of redeveloping its inner-city estates with a mix of public and private housing. Low-density suburban estates can be found in nearly every city and town in Australia. Some of the low-density housing has been sold off over the years to long term tenants, and some has begun to circulate on the private property market at high prices in gentrified suburbs such as Port Melbourne. History Public housing from the 1890s to 1970s While many Australian housing affordability academics attribute the ‚ÄòGolden Age‚Äô of affordable housing in Australia from 1945 to 1975,Sandercock, L. (1977). Cities for Sale. Carlton: Melbourne University Press.Kemeny, J. (1983), The Great Australian Nightmare. Melbourne: Georgian House. issues of affordable housing and housing conditions in state capitals for workers had become a concern of governments from early in the 20th century.Berry, M. (1988). To buy or rent? The demise of dual tenure policy in Australia'. In Howe, R. (Ed). New Houses for Old. Fifty Years of Public Housing in Victoria. Melbourne: Ministry of Housing and Construction.Hayward, D. (1996). The reluctant landlords? A history of public housing in Victoria. Urban Policy and Research, 14(1), 5-36. DOI 10.1080/08111149608551610. In the first decade of the 1900s, Australia was still feeling the effects of the 1890s economic depression.(Hayward, 1996) At the time, the only housing options available were private leasehold (accounting for 45% of tenure arrangements in Australia in 1911), owner- occupier freehold (accounting for 50% of tenure arrangements), and other informal tenure arrangements.(Hayward, 1996, p.7) Before economic recovery was achieved, however, all progress was halted by World War I from 1914-1918.(Berry, 1984) From 1912-1918, several state governments commissioned reports investigating their state‚Äôs housing system failures, resulting in the establishment of various financial schemes across all states that focused on making home ownership more attainable for more of the working class.(Hayward, 1996) In addition, the Commonwealth government established the War Service Homes Scheme in 1919 which offered very competitive loans to returned war servicemen for the purpose of constructing or buying a home.(Hayward, 1996) Although the 1920s saw a rebound in terms of economic and housing activity, the Great Depression of the 1930s saw economic and housing conditions returned to that of the worst days of the 1890s.(Hayward, 1996) During the Great Depression, unemployment in Australia rose to over 30%.(Hayward, 1996) In addition to the rising level of poverty, the lack of new housing stock in Australia left an unprecedented number of workers left powerless in the face of merciless private landlords who at the time had the legal right to take as ransom the belongings of renters to cover unpaid rent and rapidly deteriorating living conditions.(Hayward, 1996) This resulted in a significant amount of urban renters turning to informal settlements and 'slums' for shelter, such as Melbourne‚Äôs 'Dudley Mansions'. The state of the housing system nationwide and the squalor in which those who were subject to it lived drew protests from the working class and the criticism of reformists from various backgrounds. The Australian Labour Movement laid the blame for the poor social conditions of the 1930s in the capital cities squarely at the feet of the private landlords as well as the state and Commonwealth banks, which were popularly understood to also have played a critical role in the 1890s economic crash.(Hayward, 1996) From the political right, there was slowly amounting pressure to reclaim the slum sites (often formed in seaside areas in Australian capital cities) for more economically productive activities.Kusterman, R. (2010). The Sustainability of Affordable Housing in Australia ‚ÄìLessons Learnt from Studies in Brazil. National Association of Women in Construction. Retrieved from: https://www.nawic.com.au/documents/NAWIC/IWD/2014/NAWIC_SustainableAffordableHousing_RMK1.pdf At the same time, proponents of the emerging town planning movement in Australia began actively arguing for state and national government involvement in developing town plans as a means of slum eradication.(Sandercock, 1977)Howe, R. (1988). New Houses for Old: Fifty Years of Public Housing in Victoria. Melbourne: Ministry of Housing and Construction. Inspired by the garden city movement in the United Kingdom, it was thought that the rationalization of urban development via town planning could not only improve the urban environment, but also social behavior.(Sandercock, 1977) In the case of Victoria, Methodist social reformer Frederick Oswald Barnett during this period was particularly influential in creating wider popular concern (as well as voyeuristic interest) in the awful condition of the slums in Melbourne.(Howe, 1988) Another round of reports was commissioned by federal and state governments in the mid to late 1930s, including those of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board (Victoria, 1936), the Housing Slums Investigations Committee (NSW, 1936), and the Building Act Inquiry Committee (South Australia, 1937). These reports uniformly pointed to the proven inability of finance schemes directed towards home ownership to improve the housing system for the working class.(Howe, 1988) This in combination with growing social pressure for housing reform drove the Tasmanian Government to establish a housing division via the Agricultural Bank in 1935, as well as prompted the creation of the 1937 South Australian Housing Trust, the 1938 Victorian Housing Commission, and the 1942 NSW Housing Commission.(Hayward, 1996) And then World War II broke out. Against the backdrop of World War II and a housing market that had been at near standstill for a decade, the Commonwealth Housing Commission was established in 1943.Dalton, T. (1988).

Arguing that ‚Äúit has been apparent, for many years, that private enterprise, the world over has not adequately and hygienically been housing the low income group‚Äù,(quoted in Martin, 1988, p.5) the Commission promoted housing as a right for all Australians that should be targeted to low-income workers on a user-pays basis.(Dalton, 1988) While most recommendations of the 1944 Commonwealth Housing Commission Report were ignored by the federal government,Troy, P. & Lloyd, C. (1981). The Commonwealth Housing Commission and a National Housing Policy. Australian National University. Retrieved from: http://apo.org.au/system/files/60176/apo-nid60176-98876.pdf. the 1945 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA) allowed the states to establish and operate public housing as funded by the Commonwealth via cheap loans, as well as encouraged states to provide rental rebates for low-income workers.(Hayward, 1996) While all states operated their public housing schemes in varying ways and with different objectives (for New South Wales and Victoria in particular, a major focus was slum clearance and rehousing of the poverty stricken), preference for public housing was given to large families and recently returned servicemen.(Kemeny, 1983) Under the first CSHA which was in place from 1945 to 1956, public housing stock nationwide rose from next to zero to 96,292 dwellings.(Hayward, 1996) During this period, Australia recovered from the economic effects of World War II and, like many other Western nations at the same time, enjoyed a period of uninterrupted economic development.(Kemeny, 1983) As the economy strengthened, the private housing market once again became a significant supplier of new housing stock. In 1956, the recently elected Liberal-Country Coalition Party leader Robert Menzies renegotiated the 1945 CSHA, sounding the death knell to the golden age of public housing in Australia. Under the new CSHA, federal money was diverted away from public housing and rental assistance schemes, states were allowed to sell public housing via any means they saw fit, and private home ownership was encouraged once more.(Kestermann, 2010) From 1956 onwards, roughly 90,000 public housing built under the CSHA were sold across Australia.(Hayward, 1996) Further heralding the end of public housing was the emergence of economic rationalism in the 1960 and 1970s. Replacing the post-War Keynesian idea that government intervention in the housing markets was a necessary virtue, public opinion was swaying to the neoliberal idea that government intervention by the way of public housing was one of the causes of the problem.Groenhart, L. and Burke, T. (2014). Thirty years of public housing supply and consumption: 1981‚Äì2011. AHURI Final Report, 231. Retrieved from: http://www.ahuri.edu.au/publications/projects/51002. This idea was helped along by the 1975 Royal Commission into Poverty that claimed that ‚ÄúOf the total 183,000 housing authority tenants the total poor numbered only 51,000; 132,000 housing commission rented dwellings (72%) were occupied by people with incomes more than 120% of the poverty line‚Äù.(Hayward, 1996, p. 24) Social housing In recent years, not-for-profit social housing providers have developed a more prominent role in providing affordable housing to eligible tenants. These social housing providers include charities, and organisations such as the Brisbane Housing Company, a not-for-profit corporation operated by the Queensland Government and the Brisbane City Council. Cooperation between state housing departments and social housing providers is increasing, as in Queensland where prospective tenants who are on the waiting list for public housing are now also on the waiting list for social housing.Queensland Department of Housing, One Social Housing System Public housing today Construction of new public housing dwellings is currently at its lowest rate for 40 years and existing public housing stock is severely underfunded. The public housing waiting list in Victoria for example currently sits at 35,000 and is increasing dramatically. There is a severe lack of new public housing dwellings. There are also moves towards privatisation and transition into \\"community\\" and \\"social\\" housing models that create tension between non- government organisations working on housing and homelessness, with some vying for management or ownership of previously state-owned or managed public housing, while other organisations resist privatisation and advocate for the expansion of public housing to alleviate waiting lists and homelessness. There have been a number of recent campaigns to save public housing marked for demolition, advocate for upgrades and maintenance and construction of new public housing dwellings. State governments will occasionally announce funding policies for upgrades and maintenance. The issue of empty state government- owned homes is increasing as every state has hundreds or thousands of empty homes that could be transferred to public housing registers. In Melbourne, Victoria, this issue has led to the ongoing Bendigo street housing campaign in which homeless people are being housed by community campaigns in homes left empty by the Victorian state government. Suburbs with public housing Some suburbs of Australian cities with a high concentration of public housing, with at least 15% of all occupied dwellings recorded as being rented from a state or territory housing authority at the 2006 census, include: Adelaide *Elizabeth (19.3%) *Hackham West (28.1%) *Munno Para (28.2%) *Plympton Park (26.3%) Brisbane *Acacia Ridge (15.6%) *Inala (31.0%) *Riverview (30.1%) Cairns *Machans Beach (?%) *Manoora (?%) *Manunda (?%) *Moorobool (?%) Geelong *Norlane (22.6%) *Whittington (17.9%) Melbourne *Broadmeadows (15.2%) *Braybrook (24.4%) *Collingwood (28.9%) *Fitzroy (19.6%) *Flemington (31.2%) Newcastle *Bolton Point (40.2%) *Windale (65.5%) *Hamilton (29.9%) Perth *Bentley (16.3%) *Karawara (18.5%) *Mirrabooka (14.9%) *Nollomara (?%) Sydney *Claymore (95%) *Daceyville (69.5%) *Eveleigh (31.6%) *Macquarie Fields (24.3%) *Redfern (21.9%) *Riverwood (29.8%) *South Coogee (34.0%) *Waterloo (37.1%) *Mount Druitt, New South Wales (42.5%) Wollongong *Bellambi (33.1%) *Berkeley (23.7%) *Warilla (18.3%) *Warrawong (25.8%) Dwellings rented from the NSW housing authority as a percentage of all dwellings in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, at the 2011 census See also * Housing Commission of Victoria * Housing NSW * Public housing in the Australian Capital Territory * Bendigo street housing campaign * American Radburn design for public housing Australian housing * Australian property bubble * Homelessness in Australia * Home ownership in Australia * Housing in Victoria References External links State and territory housing departments *Housing & Community Services ACT *Housing NSW *Territory Housing (Northern Territory) *Queensland Department of Housing *Housing SA *Housing Tasmania *Victorian Office of Housing *Western Australian Department of Housing & Works Other social housing providers (Community Housing Providers) *BHC Creating Liveable Communities Category:Public policy in Australia ","title":"Public housing in Australia"},{"id":"12438548","text":"Kalpana Chakma is a human rights activist and feminist from Bangladesh who held the position of Organizing Secretary of the Hill Women's Federation. She and her two brothers were abducted on 12 June 1996 from her home at Lallyaghona village allegedly by the members of the Bangladesh Army. Kalpana Chakma is still missing. No one has been tried for her disappearance. She is presumed to have been killed after her abduction. Early life Kalpana Chakma was known as an active human rights activist in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. She was the organizing secretary of the Hill Women's Federation in Bangladesh. She had been criticizing Bangladesh Army repressions and harassment of the indigenous men and women. She had specially been working for the rights of the indigenous women and protesting Bangladesh Army's repression on the indigenous population by organizing conferences, seminar's and meetings in various parts of the CHT. She had also been lending her strong support to the autonomy oriented movement in the CHT spearheaded by the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, then paramilitary separatist organization of the CHT's indigenous people. Since the CHT peace treaty, which was signed on 2 December 1997, the organisation has disarmed and are now a political party working for the interests of the indigenous people. The Government of Bangladesh viewed the organization as a threat to the sovereignty of Bangladesh. In the general parliamentary elections of Bangladesh, held on 12 June 1996, she took active part in electioneering in favor of the independent candidate, Bijay Ketan Chakma. He held the post of senior presidium member of Pahari Gana Parishad. She was abducted few hours before the seventh national elections. Abduction Around 1:00 a.m. of the 12 June 1996, 6 hours before the general election of Bangladesh, Kalpana Chakma was abducted allegedly by the members of the Bangladesh Army from her home at Lallyaghona village of Rangamati in CHT. An army Lieutenant named Ferdous with two members of Village Defence Party Nurul Haque and Saleh Ahmed from the nearby Kojoichari army barrack raided Kalpana Chakma's home at that night and picked her up forcibly. Kalpana's mother 60 years old Badhuni Chakma told reporters - > \\"We were asleep when someone called out from outside and wanted to know who > were inside the house. Then they pulled down the latch of the door from > outside and entered the house. They kept powerful torchlight on our face and > took away my younger son Khudiram saying that his 'Sir' (Lieut. Ferdous) > wanted to talk to him. Few minutes later they took away my elder son > Kalicharan and my daughter Kalpana leaving behind myself and Kalicharan's > wife.\\" Kalicharan Chakma, a farmer and bread winner of the family said that three were blindfolded and tied by the hands near the well of the house and were asked to sit down. Kalicharan said - > \\"Some were wearing army fatigues and some had lungis tied up to their > waists. They first took Khudiram from us. They were speaking in Bengali.\\" Khudiram Chakma, brother of Kalpana Chakma described how he escaped - > \\"I was asked to dip into the water near the well. As soon as I did so, > someone shouted 'shoot him'. Sensing imminent death I somehow untied my > hand, removed blindfold around my eyes and started running in the waist deep > water. I could hear one gunshot behind me but I kept running.\\" Kalicharan said that after they led Khudiram away, Kalpana was taken away from his side. > \\"On hearing the gunshot and the shouting few yards away I untied my hand, > removed the fold around my eyes and jumped into the water, they shot at me > once and as I ran I could hear Kalpana cry out Dada, Dada, mahre baja > (brother, brother, rescue me).\\" Search for Kalpana Chakma The news of the incident dispersed in all directions immediately and the neighbours came to know what happened. In the early morning Khudiram with the help of Samrat Sur Chakma approached Kojoichari army camp to enquire about Kalpana Chakma from the camp authority. The camp authority at once branded him as a member of the Shanti Bahini and threatened him. He returned home frustrated. Kalicharan on the other hand, went to the local Baghaichari Police Station to register a First Information Report (FIR). But neither the police station nor the army camp took any action to release Kalpana Chakma from the abductors. Government's Role The Superintendent of Police (SP) of Rangamati under severe criticism of various national and international organisations visited Kalpana's home and informed that there were as many as 180 Bangladesh Army barracks in Rangamati district alone and so it was not possible for him to search all of them. On 14 July 1996 several women organisations jointly submitted a memo to the Home Minister of Bangladesh who advised the team to meet the Prime Minister as the Home Ministry is not concerned with law and order in the CHT. The minister also told that the CHT being an Operational Zone, was an affair of the General Officer in Command (GOC) of the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh Army and he had nothing to do with the issue. The Police investigations does not take into account indigenous eyewitness and did not question the main accused. Bangladesh Army's Role On 18 July 1996 the Bangladesh Army circulated leaflets from a helicopter declaring Taka 50,000 for information about the whereabouts of Kalpana Chakma. The Hill Watch Human Rights Forum (HWHRF), a human rights organisation blamed the Bangladesh Army authorities for deliberately trying to cover up the truth. Bangladesh Army strongly denied the accusation that Lieutenant Ferdous or any other member of the army was involved in the abduction of Kalpana Chakma. Later in the face of strong protest and condemnation, the Bangladesh Army made another attempt to cover up the issue by terming the whole incident as a \\"love affair\\". The army again changed its statement and on 23 July 1996 released a statement which runs like this - \\"Kalpana Chakma had a passport and went abroad secretly\\". But the claim of the army had been refuted by the indigenous activists and it was found that Kalpana Chakma had no passport. Women's right group have claimed that the accused security personals are still in service.

Distinctive species have few closely related species, and EDGE species are often the only surviving member of their genus or even higher taxonomic rank. The extinction of such species would therefore represent a disproportionate loss of unique evolutionary history and biodiversity. Some EDGE species, such as elephants and pandas, are well-known and already receive considerable conservation attention, but many others, such as the vaquita (the world's rarest cetacean) the bumblebee bat (arguably the world's smallest mammal) and the egg-laying long-beaked echidnas, are highly threatened yet remain poorly understood, and are frequently overlooked by existing conservation frameworks. The Zoological Society of London launched the EDGE of Existence Programme in 2007 to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of these species. As of 2019, the programme has awarded 97 fellows funds to help conserve 87 different species in over 40 countries.  Calculating EDGE Scores  ED In this phylogenetic tree, species A has a higher ED score than either species B or C ‚Äî it represents a branch rather than a twig on the tree of life. If species A were to go extinct, there would be no similar species left on the planet and a larger amount of unique evolutionary history would be lost forever. Some species are more distinct than others because they represent a larger amount of unique evolution. Species like the aardvark have few close relatives and have been evolving independently for many millions of years. Others like the domestic dog originated only recently and have many close relatives. Species uniqueness can be measured as an 'Evolutionary Distinctiveness' (ED) score, using a phylogeny, or evolutionary tree. ED scores are calculated relative to a clade of species descended from a common ancestor. The three clades for which the EDGE of Existence Programme has calculated scores are all classes, namely mammals, amphibians, and corals. The phylogenetic tree has the most recent common ancestor at the root, all the current species as the leaves, and intermediate nodes at each point of branching divergence. The branches are divided into segments (between one node and another node, a leaf, or the root). Each segment is assigned an ED score defined as the timespan it covers (in millions of years) divided by the number of species at the end of the subtree it forms. The ED of a species is the sum of the ED of the segments connecting it to the root. Thus, a long branch which produces few species will have a high ED, as the corresponding species are relatively distinctive, with few close relatives. ED metrics are not exact, because of uncertainties in both the ordering of nodes and the length of segments. GE GE is a number corresponding to a species' conservation status according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature with more endangered species having a higher GE: { - ! Conservation status  Code !! GE score -  Extinct  EX  ‚Äî -  Extinct in the wild  EW  ‚Äî -  Critically endangered  CR  4 -  Endangered  EN  3 -  Vulnerable  VU  2 -  Near threatened  NT  1 -  Least concern  LC  0 -  Data deficient  DD  ‚Äî -  Not evaluated  NE  ‚Äî } EDGE The EDGE score of a species is derived from its scores for Evolutionary Distinctness (ED) and for Globally Endangered status (GE) as follows: :\\\\text{EDGE} = \\\\ln (1+\\\\text{ED}) + \\\\text{GE}\\\\cdot \\\\ln (2)= \\\\ln[(1+\\\\text{ED})\\\\cdot 2^{\\\\text{GE}}] This means that a doubling in ED affects the EDGE score almost as much as increasing the threat level by one (e.g. from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered'). EDGE scores are an estimate of the expected loss of evolutionary history per unit time. EDGE species are species which have an above average ED score and are threatened with extinction (critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable). There are currently 564 EDGE mammal species (‚âà12% of the total). Potential EDGE species are those with high ED scores but whose conservation status is unclear (data deficient or not evaluated).  Focal species  Focal species are typically selected from the priority EDGE species ‚Äîthe top 100 amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles, top 50 sharks and rays, and top 25 corals‚Äî however, they also prioritise species outside these rankings. Such species can also have a very high ED but fall outside the top 100 EDGE rankings. These species are conserved by 'EDGE Fellows', who collect data on these species and develop conservation action plans. Top 20 2019/20 focal species Numbers refer to EDGE rank :1.

It was founded in 1992 when it replaced the old Soviet federation (Federation of bandy and field hockey USSR) as a member of the Federation of International Bandy (FIB).  History  The Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, in the middle of the bandy season. This sudden political change led the Soviet national teams to initially be rebranded as CIS in January and February 1992. A new Russian national team was also set up and at the Russian Government Cup 1992 both teams played. The federation traces its history to the national bandy federation founded in imperial Russia back in 1898.  Structure  The Russian Bandy Federation is headquartered in Moscow. President since 2009 is Boris Skrynnik, who is also the president of FIB since 2005. The federation has four vice presidents, one of whom is former pro-boxer Nikolai Valuev, who is also the general manager of the Russia national bandy team; another vice president is Sergey Myaus, head coach of the national bandy team. The federation is governing the national leagues in Russia, which is set up in a top-tier Russian Bandy Super League and second tier leagues, as well as the Russian Cup. The Russian Bandy Super League is fully professional and the winning team each year is crowned Russian champions. There are also a lot of regional and city leagues for minor and junior teams, which are not directly connected to the national leagues (teams can not be promoted to a national league) but this is where new bandy talents are discovered. These are directed through regional federations which are part of the Russian Bandy Federation.

He has been a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Tipperary constituency since the 2016 general election and a TD for the Tipperary North constituency from 2011‚Äì2016. He previously served as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Deputy leader of the Labour Party from 2014 to 2016 and Minister of State for Public and Commuter Transport from 2011 to 2014. He was a Member of the European Parliament for the South constituency from 2009 to 2011 and a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 2007 to 2009. Early life Kelly is from Portroe just outside Nenagh, County Tipperary. He is the son of Tom and Nan Kelly. His parents' house burned down in 1974, the year before he was born. Kelly was raised on a small dairy farm. His father left farming following the introduction of milk quotas by the European Council in the 1980's and found employment working on the roads for the local county council. Educated at Nenagh CBS, he subsequently attended University College Cork (UCC), where he completed a BA in English and History in 1995. Two years later he completed a M.Phil in Political History. Kelly continued his education at Boston College, where he achieved a Certificate in Leadership in 1999. He returned to Ireland shortly after this and completed a MBS in eCommerce in 2002. Kelly subsequently worked as an eBusiness Manager with Bord F√°ilte and F√°ilte Ireland. Political career Youth politics Kelly is thought to have been politicised from an early age. In his final year of secondary school, he canvassed for the Labour Party during the 1992 general election. He remained active in left-wing politics in university, firstly by establishing the Jim Kemmy Branch of the Labour Party in UCC. He then became involved in a number of by-elections, local election campaigns in Cork and in the wider Munster area. Kelly became Chair of Labour Youth in 2000, having previously served as Co-Chair. In 2001 he was a member of the General Council. In 2001 and 2002 he was director of the Tom Johnson Summer School and was also a member of the General Election Planning Committee in the period 2001-2002. Seanad √âireann: 2007‚Äì2009 In 2007, Kelly launched his own political career when he secured election to Seanad √âireann by the Agricultural Panel. He was the only Labour Party candidate in that grouping. After the election of Eamon Gilmore as leader of the Labour Party in 2007, Kelly was appointed as Labour Party Spokesperson on Tourism and was Seanad Spokesperson on Finance and Local Government. European Parliament: 2009‚Äì2011 Kelly was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the South constituency, at the 2009 European Parliament election, taking the last seat in a tight battle between him, Sinn F√©in's Toireasa Ferris and the Independent Kathy Sinnott. Kelly was a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. D√°il √âireann: 2011‚Äìpresent  31st Dail & Junior Ministry  Though he promised he would see out his five-year term in the European Parliament, Kelly allowed his name to go forward as a Labour Party candidate at the 2011 general election. He ran in the Tipperary North constituency and was successful, receiving 9,559 first preference votes (19.8%) and securing the third and final seat at the expense of Fianna F√°il's sitting TD, M√°ire Hoctor. Phil Prendergast replaced him as MEP for the South constituency. When the new coalition government was formed Kelly joined the junior ministerial ranks as Minister of State for Public and Commuter Transport. Kelly began receiving death threats during this period. Labour Party deputy leadership and cabinet minister (2014‚Äì2016) In May 2014, Kelly confirmed that he would be contesting the vote for a new deputy leader of the Labour Party following the resignation of Eamon Gilmore as party leader. He was elected as deputy leader of the Labour Party on 4 July 2014. On 11 July 2014, he was appointed Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government. In January 2015, it was announced that his leader Joan Burton had nominated Kelly for the roles of Labour's director of elections and chair of Labour's national campaign committee ahead of the upcoming general election. His involvement in Irish Water was extremely controversial during his tenure as minister. Brendan Ogle of Right2Change called his comments on water 'arrogant', with Ruth Coppinger T.D describing some his remarks as 'delusional and unbelievably arrogant'. Paul Murphy TD described plans to take water charges from wages was a 'bullying tactic'. Murphy also compared him to Nelson from 'The Simpsons'. Jonathan O'Brien TD described him as 'arrogant Alan' in September 2015. He received death threats on a regular basis during his tenure as minister. As Minister, Kelly announced a two year rent freeze to combat the housing crisis. Kelly supported the introduction and use of modular housing. He said that \\"blockages\\" had made solving the housing crisis difficult. A law brought in by Kelly which was criticised by the Irish Planning Institute (IPI), who said that it would increase ministerial planning powers over local authorities and could significantly change how planning operates in Ireland. Speaking on the This Week programme, councillors opposed to the law said that it was a \\"power grab\\", and claimed it could significantly limits the planning powers of local government. In November 2014, the Independent reported that Kelly had received death threats. Also in November 2014 he claimed that he had received four death threats from \\"anonymous warriors\\" in a single week. He claimed that Irish Water was necessary. Kelly personally that he received many death threats and described references to him by the pejorative nickname 'Calamity Kelly' by anonymous government colleagues as cowardly. Kelly's constituency office received a bomb threat in November 2014. In December 2014 it was reported that a staff member who answered a call was told \\"a bullet will be put in his head before the end of the day. And we'll come down and put a bullet in your head too, you rich f**k. We won't be paying water charges.\\" A threatening letter sent to his office in 2015 containing a 'suspicious powder' was declared a hoax by the Gardai and the Defence Forces. EU Commissioner Phil Hogan moved to distance himself from the controversies with Irish Water by stressing that Kelly was now in charge of water. Barry Cowen claimed in relation to a policy change that \\"the issue with the policy is that everytime Alan Kelly picks up a phone to a journalist, his policy for Irish Water changes and it‚Äôs become absolutely farcical.\\" In December 2015 Kelly became emotional as he strongly denied claims that he had leaked information about the Labour Party to the media. A number of Labour TDs identified him as the source of a leak of an internal analysis which suggested that Labour would lose up to 20 seats at the upcoming general election. Kelly attracted further controversy following a January 2016 interview in the Sunday Independent headlined 'Alan Kelly: \\"Power is a drug . . . it suits me\\"'. He later clarified the context in a June 2020 interview with The Mirror, saying; ‚ÄúI did say those words, but everybody forgets about the dot, dot, dot in the middle. I‚Äôve nothing against the journalist now, but if you read it, power is a drug, it suits me, there‚Äôs a dot, dot, dot in the middle. The conversation was about how some people are always in opposition and will never want to go into government. Some people, you know, being in government suits them. They‚Äôre able to handle it or deal with it, or whatever. That was the conversation and I suppose power, being in power, being in government are interchangeable words, so that was the context of it. But when you‚Äôre explaining you‚Äôre losing\\". Kelly attracted controversy for his former association with John Delaney of the FAI and denied claims that Delaney was stopping people and asking them to vote for him during the 2016 general election campaign. Delaney had asked people to support Kelly on Midwest Radio. Kelly insisted that having Delaney support him was not a form of cronyism. Former Green Party TD Dan Boyle described opposition to Delaney's support of Kelly as \\"Irish hypocrisy\\". He denied that he was 'derailing' the Labour Party's general election campaign, after party figures said that he was being brought up by voters as an issue. Kelly said that he had not heard any complaints from members or supporters. Mary Lou McDonald in a TV3 debate claimed that Kelly had ‚Äúzero credibility‚Äù among people who were looking for housing. He was successful in his campaign and was re-elected. Following the election, Kelly remained Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in an acting capacity during prolonged talks on government formation. On Sunday 24 April 2016, he represented the government at the official U.S. commemoration of the Centenary of the Easter Rising in Manhattan, New York. Kelly criticised Fine Gael's handling of Irish Water during the negotiations.  Opposition and leadership challenges (2016‚Äì2020)  Shortly afterward, on Friday 13 May 2016, Kelly announced his intention to seek leadership of the Labour Party.Alan Kelly to run for Labour Party leadership However, he failed to attract a nomination from his parliamentary colleagues, resulting in the unopposed appointment of Brendan Howlin as the new leader. Kelly was not present at the conference at which Howlin was announced as leader. Grassroots efforts to put pressure on members of the parliamentary party were unsuccessful. The parliamentary party also decided not to nominate any candidates for the position of deputy leader, leaving Kelly's previous position vacant. When asked by Hot Press if he felt 'shafted', he replied saying; \\"Yes. I was pretty annoyed about what happened. It was a difficult period but I‚Äôve moved on. There are no issues. I don‚Äôt bear grudges. But you don‚Äôt forget. You put it inward and you use it for motivation ‚Äì and you move on.\\" In the same interview he said that it was 'wrong' that the grassroots membership couldn't have a say. In Spring 2017, Kelly was approached to join Fine Gael by the Tipperary organisation, which he declined. A source believed to be close to Kelly confirmed this to be true but said that \\"Alan has time and time again said that Labour values are in his DNA and that's certainly true. He's always talking about workers and the value of work. He is certainly not one of those who just pander to the welfare or liberal agendas that Labour has become so associated with. His ambition is to drag the Labour Party back towards what he believes in rather than ever leave it\\". In September 2017, Kelly called for the HPV vaccine to be given to all schoolboys in Ireland. The vaccine's roll-out among Irish girls had recently been subject to news coverage following controversy over its alleged side effects.Labour wants the HPV vaccine to be rolled out to boys sooner rather than later In December 2017, Kelly asked the Minister for Justice if his phone was being tapped. In November 2017, Kelly was criticised by his Labour colleagues after he warned leader Brendan Howlin that he has less than six months to turn the party‚Äôs fortunes around. In August 2018, Kelly challenged incumbent Brendan Howlin for his party's leadership. His challenge failed due to lack of support from his parliamentary colleagues. The Independent described his efforts to become leader as 'persistent'. At the Labour Party think-in in Drogheda that year, he said ‚ÄúWe need a moment to reconnect with working people. We are the Labour Party. We are not the Liberal Party.‚Äù Also that month, in an interview with the Sunday Independent, he said that the Labour Party was portraying an \\"absence of visible leadership\\" on economic issues affecting ordinary people. He also said that \\"Some people say that politics shouldn't be about personalities. That's nice in theory but simply wrong in practice. Leadership in politics has always been and forever will be about strong personalities that represent political values and generate support for them from the public. Yes that involves teamwork within a party but that party has to be led with passion, energy and conviction.\\" He said that \\"Labour can no longer be part of a cosy consensus within Ireland. We must return to our roots with vigour and concern ourselves above all else with the problems of economic inequality. That must be our political crusade. Only then can we begin to regain the trust of those that the party exists to represent\\". In 2020, Kelly was re-elected to represent the Tipperary constituency during the February general election, obtaining 13,222 first preference votes (9.6%) and thus securing the fourth of five available seats. He was publicly backed by women's health campaigner Vicky Phelan during the election. As of 2020, Kelly was Labour's spokesperson on health.  Labour Party leader (2020‚Äìpresent) After Brendan Howlin's intention to stand down as party leader following the 2020 general election, Kelly was nominated by two of the party's six TDs; Se√°n Sherlock and Duncan Smith. Kelly was also publicly supported by former Labour TDs Jan O'Sullivan and Willie Penrose. Launching his election bid, Kelly said that a complete rebuild of the Labour Party was needed. On 3 April 2020, he was announced as the new leader of the Labour Party, having won 55% of the vote. Kelly became noted for his outspoken style following his election as leader. In May 2020, he appeared to rule out going into a coalition government. That same month, he quoted author George Orwell in his criticism of health services during the COVID-19 lockdown. He went on to say ‚ÄúVery simply‚Ä¶ if we got what the Green Party did in relation to seat numbers, I think you‚Äôd have a government in Ireland by now. But we only got six seats unfortunately\\". In a June 2020 interview in The Mirror, he said that; ‚ÄúI want to get the Labour Party back into a substantial position for the next electoral contests, whether it‚Äôs local, European or general. I want to get the party into that position by being completely reorganised across the country which is my forte, which is something that I really strongly do, getting really strongly organised.‚Äù He said in the same interview that he didn't 'envision' himself being in politics at the age of 60 and that having an interest in IT, he would like to get involved in green technologies and similar areas. Kelly claimed in September 2020 that the Labour Party will never be irrelevant. In October 2020, he said that Miche√°l Martin had six weeks to 'save Christmas'.  Image  Alan Kelly has been nicknamed 'AK47' for his quick temper and aggressive style. He was described in a 2020 article in Laois Today as someone who \\"not only likes his soubriquet but relishes in his characterisation of someone who shoots from the hip, takes no prisoners and gets things done\\". RTE and the Progressive Brief have described him as 'tenacious'. Newstalk ranked 'The Alan Kelly Rap' as the No.1 Irish election song ahead of the 2020 general election. Kelly is believed to be opposed to the 'liberal' and 'welfare' agendas that are said to be associated with the modern Labour Party. The Irish Times described his election as Labour Party leader as a defeat for the party's 'liberal' wing. The Laois Today and the Business Post made the implication in 2020 that he was not part of the 'liberal' wing of the party. In a 2020 interview with the Irish Independent, an anonymous party politician described him as \\"authentic to the traditional old Labour\\". In a Hot Press interview in 2017, he described himself as a practicing Catholic and said that he is very liberal on 'most issues'. He stated that he was opposed to the legalisation of prostitution, and was in favour of the legalisation of marijuana.  Personal life  Kelly is married to Regina O'Connor, a primary school teacher who was raised in Waterville, County Kerry. The couple have two children; a daughter and a son. He is the author of A Political History of County Tipperary 1916-1997 and has won numerous rugby and hurling medals according to his Labour Party summary.

Tova Cohen], Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan 2001. Without such an agreement, Jewish marriages cannot be dissolved without the consent and cooperation of both spouses. This new type of prenuptial agreement makes provisions for the possibility of divorce. By setting up rules prior to the marriage in the form of a contract, both spouses have an interest to negotiate a divorce in a dignified manner, and get-refusal is avoided.  Halakhic background  Halakha (Jewish law) states that in order for a Jewish divorce to be valid, the husband must place a get (Jewish divorce document) in his wife's hands out of his own free will (Yebamot, 14:1). If he does not have the intent to divorce his wife, no other party‚Äîperson or court, can do so in his stead. A Jewish woman chained to her marriage because of her husband's inability to grant her a get, is referred to as a mesorevet get. As of late, common usage has applied the term agunah to include a victim of get-refusal as well. When discussing the agunah problem, a distinction must be drawn between the classic definition of an agunah and a victim of get-refusal. Halakhically, an agunah is a woman whose husband has disappeared and it is not known whether he is alive or dead. The example used is the passenger on a boat that sank in ‚Äúwaters that have no end‚Äù (Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot, chapter 10). The case of the classic agunah still possibly exists today: The wives of several men who were killed on 9/11 potentially could have been declared agunot, however, with the combined international legal efforts of several prominent Orthodox rabbis, all these cases were resolved and the women were permitted to remarry. A more prevalent problem is that of a husband who is alive and well, but refuses to give his wife a get. A woman in these circumstances is called a mesorevet get - a woman who is refused a get.  Historical background  The problem of get-refusal became more widespread when Jews lived in countries where civil divorce was available, separate from religious divorce. The earliest prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal was developed and accepted by the Rabbinical Council of Morocco on December 16, 1953 (\\"Sefer Hatakanot\\", Vol. 1, The Institute for Moroccan Jewish Tradition, Jerusalem). The prenuptial agreement gained further approbation in 1981 from Chalom Messas, chief rabbi of Jerusalem (\\"Sefer Tevuot Shemesh\\", Jerusalem 1981). Following Messas' involvement, the Rabbinical Council of America actively pursued this issue (‚ÄúThe RCA Commission: Solving the Problem of Gittin\\", Hamevaser, Vol. 22 No. 2, October 27, 1983). The latest in a series of RCA resolutions -- \\"that since there is a significant agunah problem in America and throughout the Jewish world, no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed‚Äù‚Äîwas passed on May 18, 2006.  Prenuptial agreement as preventive solution  In the United States, the most prominent prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal signed within the Orthodox Jewish community is the agreement of the Beth Din of America. It is a ‚Äúbinding arbitration agreement.‚Äù The Beth Din, accepted by both bride and groom as an arbitration panel, is legally enabled to render a binding decision in all issues relating to a get. This ensures that all adjudication leading up to the administration of a get is done according to Orthodox halakha, by Rabbinical Judges. The clauses of the prenuptial agreement delineate the rules accepted by the signatories, according to which the Rabbinical Court should rule. There are optional clauses authorizing the court to rule on monetary matters or child custody and related issues. The entire agreement is in keeping with the law of the State where it is signed and can be enforced as a binding arbitration agreement in the State Court. The heart of the prenuptial agreement is the monetary obligation undertaken by the groom. He obligates himself to support his wife at a particular rate (from the point of separation) as long as they are married according to Jewish law, if the Beth Din renders a decision enforcing this obligation. In essence this means that from the point that his wife asks for a get and the Beth Din recommends that he deliver the get, until he gives the get, the husband is obligated ‚Äúto support my Wife-to-Be from the date that our domestic residence together shall cease for whatever reasons, at the rate of ‚Ä¶ in lieu of my Jewish law obligation of support so long as the two of us remain married according to Jewish law‚Ä¶.‚Äù Rabbi Aryeh Klapper attests: \\"A wide variety of prenuptial agreements have been proposed. Each had its halakhic proponents and detractors, but for better or worse none gained the kind of widespread support necessary for effectiveness until seven years ago. At that time, a mechanism originally suggested by Rabbi J. David Bleich and developed by Rabbi Mordekhai Willig gained overwhelming halakhic approval throughout the Orthodox rabbinate. Rabbinical organizations such as the RCA and Young Israel, and lay organizations such as the Orthodox Caucus and the Wedding Resource Center, then began the continuing effort to make signing this agreement universal practice. This effort is meeting with growing success. The number of couples signing the agreements is growing dramatically, as is the number of rabbis strongly recommending it, or even refusing to officiate without it, in prenuptial meetings.\\"http://www.summerbeitmidrash.org/sbm/SBM.nsf/DocsByUName/08006395AE0572EB87256A3600686AB0/$File/prenup.fin.pdf!OpenElement The director of the Beth Din of America, Yona Reiss, has repeatedly stated in public arenas (orally and weekly in The Jewish Press newspaper) that to his knowledge, the \\"prenuptial agreement is one hundred percent effective. In every case of a couple that had previously signed a prenuptial agreement and later came to divorce, there was a get delivered in a timely fashion.\\". The Organization for the Resolution of Agunot began its Agunah Prevention Initiative to educate the North American Jewish community about the importance of standardizing the use of the prenuptial agreement to prevent situations of get-refusal. In November 2014, they released a video to promote the message that \\"friends don't let friends get married without the prenup.\\" There are additional prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal which have been signed in the United States. Moshe Tendler offers an alternate version. Conservative Judaism has sought to prevent cases of get-refusal by attaching a clause to the ketubah (marriage contract), as opposed to a separate prenuptial agreement, known as the Lieberman clause: The parties agree that if there are civil divorce proceedings, then both must appear before a beth din (rabbinical court) of the Rabbinical Assembly and of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Saul Lieberman, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary, proposed that the clause be added to the ketubah to create a legal remedy through civil courts in case one party fails to cooperate in Jewish divorce proceedings. The Women's League of Conservative Judaism officially endorsed the use of the Lieberman clause in combination with a prenuptial agreement in 2008. In practice, women have been successful in getting courts to enforce the \\"Lieberman Clause\\", though not always the ketubah itself, in U.S. state courts, including the highest court of the state of New York,David Ellenson and James Ellenson, \\"American Courts and the Enforceability of a Ketubah as a Private Contract: An Investigation of Recent U.S. Court Decisions\\" Conservative Judaism35:3 (1982) though continuing questions about the legal validity of the document have led the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly to encourage the signing of a letter of intent together with the clause.http://www.ritualwell.org/ritual/lieberman-clause  Heskem L‚ÄôKavod Hadadi  A different agreement developed in Israel in Hebrew, called the Heskem L‚ÄôKavod Hadadi (the Agreement for Mutual Respect) was authored by a team of two rabbis and a rabbinical court advocate ‚Äî David Ben Zazon, Elyashiv Knohl and Rachel Levmore ‚Äî in consultation with experts in various fields (Jewish law, Rabbinic courts, family law, women's organizations, psychology). This particular agreement is recommended by concerned organizations, rabbinic as well as feminist, including the director of the Israeli rabbinical courts, Eli Ben-Dahan. The prenuptial agreement essentially works on a similar principle of spousal support in the case of recalcitrance as that of the Beth Din of America. However, in the Agreement for Mutual Respect the obligation is mutual. Both the bride and the groom obligate themselves to support his or her spouse, the amount ranging from $1500 per month to half his/her monthly net income. The obligation is activated after notification followed by a defined waiting period, if the couple is still married according to halakha. If a spouse is willing to give/accept a get unconditionally at that point, his/her obligation is voided. In this manner only the recalcitrant spouse's obligation will remain in effect. Obviously, if a get were administered during the waiting period, neither spouse is obligated to the other. There are additional matters covered by this agreement, such as: If one of the spouses demands marital therapy, the other must comply up to three visits; the community property law of the State of Israel is accepted as halakha for those that sign the agreement. The Council of Young Israel Rabbis in Israel, in cooperation with Yonah Reiss and Michael Broyde, both of the Beth Din of America, translated the Agreement for Mutual Respect into English. A clause is included which assigns jurisdiction to the Beth Din of America in the case where the Agreement for Mutual Respect itself would prove to be unenforceable for any reason in the State of Israel or \\"in the jurisdiction that the parties reside in at the time that either one of them seeks enforcement of its provisions\\". Under those circumstances the Agreement for Mutual Respect converts into a binding arbitration agreement with the Beth Din of America assigned as the arbiter. This same agreement has been translated from the original Hebrew also into French, Spanish. and Russian. In the United Kingdom, the London Beth Din offers a prenuptial agreement which is in essence a generic arbitration agreement appointing the London Beth Din as arbiter \\"in the event of any matrimonial dispute, they will both attend the Court of the Chief Rabbi, the London Beth Din ‚Ä¶ when required to do so and that they will comply with the instructions of that Beth Din, including co-operation in any mediation recommended, in seeking to resolve all problems arising out of or in connection with their Jewish marriage.\\" A more detailed agreement, based on the Israeli \\"Agreement for Mutual Respect\\", which was adapted to the specifics of British family law was drawn up by Rachel Levmore with British barrister Daniel Clarke, called \\"The Prenuptial Agreement for Mutual Respect (PAMR) for use in England\\".  Rabbinic debate  Some rabbis have expressed halakhic reservations with the Jewish prenuptial agreement. On May 4, 2015, Sholom Shuchat delivered a speech decrying the use of the prenup, explaining why it may disqualify any get obtained as a result of it. On August 2, 2015, Moshe Sternbuch announced that the Beth Din of America prenuptial agreement results in potentially disqualified gittin. Others have objected to the Heskem L‚ÄôKavod Hadadi.

The book was presented to Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poramen Maha Vajiravudh in the Royal Ceremony on Merit Marking in Dedication to the Late Kings in 1926. There are various suspicions concerning the Verse, one of these is that the verse was composed in Ayutthaya Period. However, many academicians could not decide who was the author of which, even at the foot of the Verse stated that \\"The prediction about the Kingdom by Somdet Phra Narai, King of Nopburi, ends here.\\" Prince Damrong Rachanuphap, father of the Thai histories, explained in \\"Athibai phaen thi phra nakhon si autthaya\\" that: It is manifested in \\"Kham hai kan chao krung kao\\" (Testimony by the People from the Old Kingdom) that the Verse was composed by Somdet Phra Sanphet Thi Paet (th: ‡∏™‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏à‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏£‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏ç‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà ‡πò, King Sanphet the Eighth; reigned 1703‚Äî1708). The academicians greatly supported this, and suspected that the Verse was composed with the royal purpose to use as political psychology. King Sanphet the Eighth might use the Verse to erode public faith and trust that the government could not maintain the national security. In present periods, Thai rulers also use this poetic work on political intentions.

The highway travels east along the Columbia River from an intersection with SR 4 in West Longview through the Port of Longview and the termini of SR 433 and SR 411 in Longview. SR 432 crosses the Cowlitz River on a divided highway and ends at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Kelso. SR 432 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering as SR 832, replacing a branch of Primary State Highway 12 (PSH 12) that had been routed through Longview and Kelso since 1937. SR 432 was established in 1968 and originally routed on Nichols Boulevard within Longview and was re-aligned onto its current route in 1991 after the opening of Industrial Way. Route description I-5 northbound at the Longview Wye in Kelso, the eastern terminus of SR 432 Longview Wye Interchange SR 432 begins at an intersection with the Ocean Beach Highway, signed as SR 4, in West Longview in Cowlitz County. The two-lane highway travels southeast as Willow Grove Connection Road and Industrial Way around Mount Solo and into the city of Longview. The four-lane SR 432 parallel to a Columbia and Cowlitz Railway line and the Columbia River through the Port of Longview and intersects the northern terminus of SR 433, which travels on Oregon Way and the Lewis and Clark Bridge to Rainier, Oregon. The highway turns northeast onto 3rd Avenue and crosses a BNSF rail line before it intersects the Tennant Way divided highway and the southern terminus of SR 411 in a partial cloverleaf interchange. The SR 432 designation travels onto four- lane Tennant Way grade-separated highway and continues southeast, parallel to a BNSF rail yard, before intersecting Dike Road in a partial cloverleaf interchange and crossing over the Cowlitz River into Kelso. The highway travels south of Southwest Washington Regional Airport and intersects Talley Way in a partial cloverleaf interchange before intersecting I-5. The partial cloverleaf interchange, nicknamed the Longview Wye, serves as the eastern terminus of SR 432 while the roadway continues south as the Old Pacific Highway. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 432 is the bridge over the Cowlitz River, serving 30,000 vehicles, while the least busy section is the western terminus at SR 4 in West Longview, serving 3,500 vehicles. The entire route of SR 432 is designated as an Intermodal Connector within the National Highway System, a highway system that includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility; and as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. SR 432 forms part of the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic, serving as the link between Longview and the Lewis and Clark Bridge via 3rd Avenue on the bicycle race held annually. History SR 432 has been part of the Washington state highway system since 1937, when it was designated as a branch of PSH 12. The Longview-Kelso branch of PSH 12 traveled east from an intersection with the Ocean Beach Highway, signed as PSH 12 and U.S. Route 830 (US 830), onto Nichols Boulevard around Lake Sacajawea and Tennant Way in Longview and crossed the Cowlitz River to Kelso, where the highway ended at an intersection with the Pacific Highway, signed as PSH 1 and US 99. In 1952, the highway was proposed as U.S. Route 830 Alternate shortly after the completion of the Longview Wye on US 99 (now I-5). The Longview- Kelso branch of PSH 12 was replaced by SR 832 during the 1964 highway renumbering and existed until US 830 was decommissioned in 1967, as SR 432 was established as an auxiliary route of SR 4 before the highway system was codified in 1970. SR 432 was re-aligned onto its present route, Industrial Way, in 1991 to end at SR 4 in West Longview and to serve the Port of Longview. The eastern terminus of SR 432, an interchange with I-5 nicknamed the Longview Wye, was reconstructed by WSDOT beginning in December 2009. WSDOT removed the northwest loop ramp, which connected Old Pacific Highway to southbound I-5, and replaced it with an improved interchange with Talley Way that opened on October 28, 2011.

The highway was meant to serve as a northern bypass of Pullman in Whitman County, traveling east from U.S. Route 195 (US 195) west of the city to SR 270 east of the city. Proposals were first drawn in 1969 for a complete ring road around Pullman, with the west side built and signed as US 195 in 1975. The northern segment of the ring road was codified in law in 1973 as SR 276, however no construction has occurred; in 2016, the highway was removed via legislative action. Route description SR 276 was legislated to begin at an intersection with US 195 west of Pullman in rural Whitman County. The highway would continue east through the Palouse as a divided limited-access highway, intersecting Brayton Road at an at-grade intersection and SR 27 at a diamond interchange. SR 276 would have turned southeast and intersect the future Coliseum Road at a diamond interchange before ending at SR 270 east of Pullman. The highway was proposed primarily to relieve traffic on SR 27 and SR 270 through downtown Pullman, measured in surveys conducted by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) using average annual daily traffic (AADT). WSDOT determined the intersection between SR 27 and SR 270 in downtown Pullman as the busiest highway in the region. SR 270 averaged 19,000 vehicles east of the intersection and SR 27 averaged 16,000 vehicles south of the intersection in 2011, while WSDOT predicted that average traffic could rise to 26,000 vehicles by 2025. History A ring road around Pullman was first proposed by the Washington State Highway Commission in 1966 and surveyed in 1970. Right-of-way acquisition by WSDOT began in 1972 and the corridor was designated and codified into law as SR 276 the following year. of the ring road was completed west of the city as part of US 195 in 1974 while a public survey in 1975 recommended a southern bypass for SR 270 instead of SR 276. The bypass project was canceled by 1978 and the WSDOT right-of-way was leased to farmers for agricultural purposes. The project was restarted with a transportation study from the Spokane Regional Council in 1993 and funded by the Pullman municipal government as part of their comprehensive plan. A route development plan, funded by WSDOT, recommended the construction of a divided limited-access highway with a single at-grade intersection at Brayton Road. In early 2016, a bill was introduced in the Washington State Legislature to decommission the unbuilt highway by removing its designation, primarily to facilitate the expansion of the Pullman‚ÄìMoscow Regional Airport runway per an agreement signed four years earlier. The bill was passed out of the legislature and was signed by the Governor of Washington on April 1, 2016. The following year, the Pullman city government proposed the construction of a southerly bypass connecting US 195 to SR 270 near Mary's Park.

Design The transit center was designed by EE&K.; The plan for the structure would have been a modern glass and steel building surrounding a \\"great space\\". Because the facility would have been built over the tracks, one of the dominant features would have been a grand staircase. The center was designed as a multi-level station with heavy rail (commuter, Amtrak, Union Pacific freight) running under a large public space with light rail running via an elevated structure. Main Street would have been split into Upper Main Street, with access to the station at the level of the public space in a loop, and Lower Main Street, which would have gone underneath the entire station and continued on as North Main Street.

Along with the Maezaei, the Daesitiates were part of the western group of Pannonians in Roman Dalmatia. They were prominent from the end of the 4th century BC up until the beginning of the 3rd century CE. Evidence of their daily activities can be found in literary sources, as well as in the rich material finds from Central Bosnian cultural group that is commonly associated with tribe of Daesitiates.  Etymology  The Serbian name Desitiajti and Albanian Desitiatet, were borrowed from the latin source, daesitiates. The name is thought to be connected to the illyrian word for ram.

History  Because the Daesitiates were present during Roman rule in the western Balkans, their name can be found in many inscriptions and historical works of ancient writers. During the 19th century, scientific interest in the Daesitiates materialized whereby research was focused in parts of Upper Bosnia. However, all research efforts have yet to provide a complete analysis of the Daesitiates. They were one of the main components of the Illyrian ethno-cultural complex that stretched from the southern Adriatic to the Danube in the north. The capital of the tribe could be in the modern day town of Breza located in central part of Bosnia. They developed cohesive community that was characterized by clearly defined political, social and economic structures. Because of their favorable geographical position and rich ore deposits and fertile land they played significant role among neighboring Illyrian tribes. They have developed a degree of cultural unity and several organized centres.  Roman Empire  After nearly three centuries of political independence, the Daesitiates (and their polity) were conquered by Roman Emperor Augustus. Afterwards, the Daesitiates were incorporated into the province of Illyricum with a low total of 103 decuriae. Ultimately, the widening gap between the Roman government and its subjects in Illyricum led to the Great Illyrian revolt, which began in the spring of 6 AD. The Daesitiates were the first to revolt under the leadership of Bato the Daesitiate and were soon joined by the Breuci. Other natives were recruited to fight against the Marcomanni while the rebellion swiftly overtook enormous areas of the western Balkans and the Danube region. The four year war, which lasted from AD 6 to 9, saw huge concentrations of Roman forces in the area, (on one occasion 10 legions and their auxiliaries in a single camp), with whole armies operating across the western Balkans and fighting on more than one front.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, p. 183, . ...Pannonian Illyrians between Italy and the East. That could only be done at a great cost and not before a rebellion of Illyricum brought the regime of Augustus to the brink of disaster. The role of the Daesitiates in the rebellion was immense, which contributed to their ultimate disappearance in subsequent Romanization that followed. Their identity in the later antiquity was transformed into municipal identities and a provincial Dalmatian identity.  Archeological sites  Tribes in Illyria and Lower Pannonia Considerable number of remains of fortifications, villages and settlements were left behind. Some of them were partly investigated by archaeological excavations during which numerous necropolis and tombs were discovered such as fortifications in the La≈°va Valley, Gradine near Kiseljak, Gradine in Sarajevo Field, archeological site of Kamenjak. However, most significant site was found in Bugojno, called Gradina Pod. It is characterized by urban-type settlements located close to large arable land complexes and contained high level of residential architecture.

The boldly-patterned head is brown with white eyebrows, moustachial stripe and throat and grey sides to the neck. The outer tail- feathers are white and the legs are pinkish-brown. Females are similar but are duller and paler with a less well-defined head pattern. The song is a short, hurried phrase given from a prominent perch. The call is a series of up to four sharp notes. It breeds in southern Siberia, northern and eastern China, eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Korea and Japan. It is fairly non- migratory but northern birds move south as far as southern China and Taiwan. There are several records from Europe but many of these are considered to be escapes from captivity rather than genuine vagrants. It occurs in dry, open habitats such as scrub, farmland, grassland and open woodland. The nest is built low in bushes or on the ground. Three to five eggs are laid and are incubated for 11 days. The young birds fledge after another 11 days. Pairs are monogamous and use the same area for breeding several years in a row. References * Brazil, Mark A. (1991). The Birds of Japan.

He became close friends with painter Guillaume Vogels and sculptor Auguste Philippette whose sister he married a few years later. In Brussels, initially he worked as a home decorator for Vogels, but later he was dedicated to painting as he became increasingly known for his talent. In 1878 he represented Greece at the International Art Biennalle of Paris. He died of chronic tuberculosisŒúŒπœÉŒπœÅŒªŒÆ, ŒùŒ≠ŒªŒªŒ∑ (1993).

It was established in 2007 and is the first time that Pakistani club football matches are telecast live on television via GEO Super. The SFL runs separate to the Pakistan Premier League and at the moment, the winners of the SFL will not be declared the official champions of Pakistan like the PPL winners. In the inaugural season as well as the second season (2010), all matches were being played in Karachi's Peoples Football Stadium. Introduction Geo TV Network and the Pakistan Football Federation came together in 2006 and began work on establishing Pakistan‚Äôs first national inter-city football league to be televised and broadcast live on GEO Super. The Geo Super Football League (SFL) was created as a way to fuse Pakistan's football talent, with experienced internationals playing with youth, and to develop football in Pakistan. It would be a new top flight league, and the first time the teams will be professional and non departmental. Instead, they represent Pakistan's major cities. Aspiring stars were selected after a gruelling nationwide hunt of all aspiring football players, and will make up half of the team. Thousands of youngsters and experienced players turned out at trials in Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Quetta, which took place between 17 and 25 June. Given the level of interest, the selection committee, which consists of members of the PFF and Geo TV Network, had their work cut out for them. Over a hundred matches were held in all the locations in varying degrees of heat and weather conditions. Each player was given an ample chance to prove themselves through these matches, which revealed their ability to perform in real-time, tense situations. Each player was individually discussed during the matches and in serious post-match analysis of every match that was played, before final selections took place. The current champions are \\"Islamabad United\\" winning 4-3 on penalties in the final against Karachi Bazigar Also The finals of the season 2007 ended in penalties The Identity and Graphics including the logo is designed by Shahzad Nawaz Training camps Thirty players for each of the five teams were taken to camp, and only twenty each were selected to participate. The players were tested for their football skills, as well as their mental and physical toughness. Individual drills, team drills, strength and stamina conditioning were the main focus of the training camps to prepare the teams for their first ever national exposure. Teams The SFL currently is made up of five teams, representative of five different cities. Each team is composed of national and international players who are experienced in both local and international football. For the first time, the best players of the nation will come together under the umbrella of these five cities to compete for the first national inter-city football league.

Pornography in India is available in print magazines, but is mainly consumed using the internet. This consumption is increasing with the increased prevalence of smartphones and the internet. Despite the increased access, public discourse and attitudes on pornography remain muted and a taboo in many parts of India. In India, publishing or transmitting pornographic material is illegal. Types of publication Print Studies have found that print media is less widely accessible than internet media in India. A randomized survey of 96 random vendors, such as video stores, mobile downloads/recharge stores and cybercaf√©s, in Haryana, India found that 17% displayed pornography openly, 34% displayed it semi-openly, and 49% kept it hidden.Ravi Shankar, (2012).

Journal of Family Welfare, 50, 71‚Äì78. and legal issues (such as those described below) make it more desirable to view pornography in India through internet mediums, such as computers or smartphones, for more privacy.  Internet  Internet pornography has become very popular in India with from 30% up to 70% of total traffic from porn websites. It has become a major portion of traffic and source of data revenue for telecom companies. A popular porn site released viewership data and national capital Delhi recorded up to 40% of all traffic. One self reporting survey found that 63% of youths in urban areas such as Haryana reported watching pornography, with 74% accessing it through their mobile phones. As smartphone and internet access in India continues to increase, more people will be able to privately view pornography.Shaik S, Rajkumar RP. Internet access and sexual offences against children: an analysis of crime bureau statistics from India. Open Journal of Psychiatry & Allied Sciences. 2015 Mar 8. Quartz has have found that 50% of Indian IP addresses accessed popular pornography websites on mobile phones. Online erotic comics have also become popular in India as the internet becomes more readily available to the common citizen. Softcore pornography Prior to the explosion of the internet, soft-core pornographic movies were popularly consumed in India.  Legality  * The selling and distribution of pornographic material is illegal in India under section 292. * The distribution, sale, or circulation of obscene materials and the selling of pornographic content to any person under age 20 years are illegal under section 293 and IT Act-67B. * Child pornography is illegal and strictly prohibited across the country under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 * The manufacturing, publishing and distribution of pornography is illegal in India under section 292, 293. In July 2015 the Supreme Court of India refused to allow the blocking of pornographic websites and said that watching pornography indoors in the privacy of one's own home was not a crime. In August 2015 the Government of India issued an order to Indian ISPs to block at least 857 websites that it considered to be pornographic. In 2015 the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had asked internet service providers to take down 857 websites in a bid to control cyber crime, but after receiving criticism from the authorities it partially rescinded the ban. The ban from the government came after a lawyer filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that online pornography encourages sex crimes and rapes. In February 2016 the Supreme Court asked the Indian Government to suggest ways of banning all forms of child pornography. In October 2018 the government directed Internet service providers to block 827 websites that host pornographic content following an order by the Uttarakhand High Court. The court cited the rape of a 10th standard girl from Dehradun by four of her seniors. The four accused told police that they raped the girl after watching pornography on the Internet.  Judicial opinion  The Supreme Court of India, in Khoday Distilleries Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. - (1995) 1 SCC 574, held that there is no fundamental right to carry on business of exhibiting and publishing pornographic or obscene films and literature. Kamlesh Vaswani vs. Union of India and ors in 2013 (diary 5917, 2013), a PIL petition was filed in the Supreme Court of India seeking a ban on pornography in India. The Court issued a notice to the central government of India and sought its response. The government informed the Court that the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee constituted under Section 88 of the IT Act, 2000 was assigned with a brief with regard to availability of pornography on the Internet and it was looking into the matter. On 26 January 2016, the Supreme Court in written order, instructed govt \\"to suggest the ways and means so that these activities are curbed. The innocent children cannot be made prey to these kind of painful situations, and a nation, by no means, can afford to carry any kind of experiment with its children in the name of liberty and freedom of expression. When we say nation, we mean each member of the collective\\".

Socio-cultural attitudes  Many sex related topics, such as pornography, are considered taboo in traditional Indian households. This trend seems to be rapidly changing, especially in urbanized cities. Researchers have found that the primary sex education of youth born in the 1990s onwards in India comes from pornography and conversations amongst their peers, which has been known to cause long term sexual anxiety and frustration in other cultures where youth learn sexual attitudes from pornography.Abraham, L. (2001). Redrawing the Lakshman rekha: Gender differences and cultural constructions in youth sexuality in urban India. South Asia, 24, 133‚Äì156. However, due to the internet and increased access for the common citizen, pornography has slowly entered the public discourse, most notably with the outrage towards a 2015 government order to censor 857 websites that contained explicit materials. Homosexual pornography Homosexual pornography is not widely available in print, due to the socio-culture taboo surrounding both pornography and homosexuality (see LGBT culture in India). However, Indian IP addresses access both lesbian and gay porn using the internet, with a 213% increase in searches for gay porn from 2013 to 2014. Additionally, the most popular search for pornography amongst females in India, centers on lesbian and gay pornography.  Violence  Important people in media have argued that censoring pornography would decrease rapes in India. There has not been a link between pornography being a significant factor in the rate of crime and violence in India.S.B. Math, B. Viswanath, A.S. Maroky, N.C. Kumar, A.V. Cherian, M.C. Nirmala. Sexual crime in India: is it influenced by pornography? Indian J Psychol Med, 36 (2014), pp. 147‚Äì152 The link between pornography and sexual violence has not been observed in other countries.  Sex work  Some studies have speculated that pornography influences sex work in India.Bradley, J., Rajaram, S. P., Isac, S., Gurav, K., Ramesh, B. M., Gowda, C., Moses, S., & Alary, M. (2015).

For instance, one study of 555 female sex workers found that 45% self-reported pornographic influence driving clientele desire for anal sex. In another study, female sex workers reported being asked to perform new sexual acts such as anal sex, masturbation and different sex positions, requests that they believed were due to an increased exposure to pornography. The implications of such work is currently unclear for public health policy in India.

Rangarajan addressing at the Distinguished Lectures function on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Indian Economic Service in 2011. The Indian Economic Service was introduced by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for formulating and implementing economic policies and programmes in India. The initial steps towards formation of service can be traced to 1952. A Committee under V. T. Krishnamachari submitted a report in September 1953, recommending the formation of a service to be known as the Statistical and Economic Advisory Service. On the contrary, Prasanta Mahalanobis did not favour the idea of a combined Statistical and Economic Advisory Service. The Cabinet in its meeting held on 12 February 1958 decided that two separate services should be formed; a Statistical Service and other an Economic Service. The Indian Economic Service was constituted on 1 November 1961 and the Service Rules were notified on the same date. The actual operationalization of service took place in 1964. Until 2009, the post of Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India was a Union Public Service Commission appointment and until the 1970s almost all CEAs were members of the Indian Economic Service.

Its activities include Dinghy sailing and racing on the river, and yachting in the Solent and further afield, as well as an active social side including 'Club Nights' every Tuesday evening. An RYA-approved offshore training establishment with a full training programme is provided, including RYA theory and practical courses for Competent Crew, day skipper, coastal skipper and yachtmaster. Dinghy racing takes place most weekends throughout the year and some evenings during the summer. Mostly dinghies raced are Enterprises and Lasers. In addition to sailing at Hammersmith, there are regular events against other dinghy clubs on the Thames and clubs further afield. The yachting programme includes cruises (around the UK, cross-channel, in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean), training weekends, treasure hunts and races organised by the club. The club also participates in winter and spring series racing in the Solent, Cowes Week, Round the Island Race, Cork week, offshore JOG races, RORC races, the Fastnet race and some member-organised events. The clubhouse is a Georgian building with river views and full facilities. History Linden House The club was established as the Corinthian Sailing Club in 1894, by a group of sailing enthusiasts who launched their boats from Bell Steps, beside the Black Lion pub, and close to the Hammersmith and Chiswick border. In the early years the members were all men and used to meet at each other's homes to discuss sailing matters and racing. It was then discovered that a new member owned a pub closer to the City and meetings were promptly convened there instead. This stretch of the Thames tideway was also originally home to the London Sailing Club, which rented a clubhouse directly on the river between The Dove and The Rutland pubs. When the London Sailing Club moved down river towards Essex, the Corinthians were offered the lease of this building and changed their name to the London Corinthian Sailing Club. Boats were moored on the tidal water and at a later date on land when space became available. For the first forty years or so members built and owned various designs and sizes of boats and a complicated method of handicapping races was devised. During the Second World War the club was asked to provide boat and sailing training for the Royal Air Force. Celestial navigation classes were also started about this time by Dr. Olaf Bradbury and today the club is a West London centre for shore based navigation classes. After the Second World War the club grew in popularity and became very influential in dinghy design and racing. The club has long associations with Uffa Fox and Jack Holt, designers and builders of famous dinghy classes (Fireflies, Enterprises, GP 14's, etc.). Other classes sailed on this stretch of the river included the Swordfish, International 14, OK, Merlin, Cadet, Mirror and in recent years the Laser and RS200. The clubhouse suffered severe bomb damage from a V-1 flying bomb during the latter part of the war. Repairs were undertaken, but the structure's days were numbered. Due to significant bomb damage surrounding the clubhouse the Hammersmith Town Council decided that the area should be razed and public gardens created (Furnival Gardens). The old clubhouse was finally demolished and in the early 1960s the London Corinthians were relocated 200 metres up river to Linden House,Linden House: a brief history from London Corinthian Trust a gracious refurbished Georgian building. This new accommodation provided room for future growth and a superb environment for sailing tuition and social functions. Simultaneously, secure covered accommodation for over 100 boats was constructed beneath a development of adjacent flats. Launching ramps, spacious pontoons and a race officers' starting box were installed next to the river. Throughout the years the London Corinthians have welcomed a broad and diverse membership. It was one of the first London clubs to allow women boat owners and sailors to participate in this hitherto 'male only' sport. Rupert D'Oyly Carte the opera impresario, and his brother Lucas, and musician Leon Goosens were former members. Athlete Roger Bannister, scientist and broadcaster Dr. Magnus Pyke and naturalist Sir Peter Scott all sailed at the club. The reformist MP and author of the popular novel 'The Water Gypsies', A P Herbert, was a solid supporter of the Club throughout his life and his son John was until recently the club's President. At Sport England's suggestion the LCSC formed the registered charity The London Corinthian Trust (roughly 1998) to purchase Linden House and to safeguard the building for sports use in perpetuity. The Trust owns and maintains Linden House, which is the clubhouse for the London Corinthian Sailing Club and the Sons of the Thames Rowing Club. Donations to further the trust's work are greatly appreciated. Linden House is a popular venue for meetings and private celebrations. For much more about Linden House and the trust see the Linden House link below. The club continues to grow and is experiencing resurgence in river dinghy sailing. Much of this is due to increased public awareness, availability of club owned boats for members to hire and the popular 'come and try it' weekends that encourage novices onto the water for the first time. The club is committed to expanding recreational sailing and racing on the Thames and a number of initiatives are being brought forward to safeguard the long-term future of this sport on the tideway. The club's offshore group continues to grow and since 2007 several teams enter the prestigious biennial Fastnet race. Various rallies, treasure hunts and races are organised on the South Coast, with charter cruises further afield. The club has expanded its shore based theory classes and now offers a wide range of RYA courses, including Yachtmaster and Day Skipper. The club's social events at Linden House are very popular and both informal and formal events are organised throughout the year.

Career Crewe, Stoke & Belle Vue Born in Manchester, England, Collins started his career with the Crewe Kings before moving Belle Vue Aces. He was loaned to the Stoke Potters in 1976 but in 1977 he made a place with the Aces his own, riding alongside brother Peter and family friend Chris Morton. Leicester Lions & 1982 World Individual Final He moved to the Leicester Lions in 1980 where he stayed until 1983. It was the 1982 season however that proved to be the high point of his career. He qualified for his first and only Speedway World Championship final, winning the Inter Continental title on the way. He finished runner-up that day, despite being the only rider to beat the eventual and defending champion, home town (Los Angeles) hero Bruce Penhall. The final was held at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. An incident involving Penhall and the late Kenny Carter in heat 14 saw Carter excluded. Both riders were being beaten by Peter Collins at the point of the crash. Despite protests by Carter it was he who was excluded rather than Penhall; If Penhall had been excluded then the title may have headed in Les's direction. Older brother Peter had been comfortably leading the race when Carter fell. Penhall won the re-run from Peter Collins and Australia's Phil Crump.

The club was a member of the Liga Na»õionalƒÉ. They were often referred to as \\"The Tigers\\"; their home arena was nicknamed \\"The Jungle\\" due to the loud crowd and the pressure they could create on visiting teams. After reaching the playoffs four times but never advancing the first round BC Mure»ô went all the way to the finals in the 2012‚Äì13 LNBM season, but lost 4‚Äì2 in a seven-game series in front of CSU Asesoft Ploiesti. In 2013, BC Mure»ô debuted in Europe in the EuroChallenge and in 2018, the club was dissolved.Inevitabilul s-a produs! BC Mure»ô s-a retras din Liga Na»õionalƒÉ. totalbaschet.ro History Former logo. The interior of the home arena of the club BC Mures in its first season (2004‚Äì05) started out in the B Division but quickly moved up to the A Division in only one season where they hold their position to this day. In the 2005‚Äì06 season BC Mures Coach Mihai Corui signed their first American player in the club's history Terry Cooper who was playing in the Dutch Basketball PromotieDivisie to strengthen their team. American Gerald Cannon and Canadian Dwayne Burton followed thereafter. The team played a lot better than the first part of the season along with a better crowd attendance with the American players however the team finished 13th. Thus BC Mures were expected to be demoted to the B Division the league decided to extend the number of teams to 14, therefore BC Mures could keep their position in the A Division. Taking advantage of this opportunity in the 2006‚Äì07 season coached by Mihai Corui, BC Mures put together a team that relied mostly on USA players and with the whole city behind their back they fell only one game short from reaching the playoffs. Following the successful previous season in 2007‚Äì08 the team brought back, the already crowd favorites JuJuan Cooley, Bryan McCullough and added more important pieces to the roster. The team performed very well at home struggling away from \\"The Jungle\\" but they managed to secure the first playoff appearance in the club's history. BC Mures finished 8th and had to duel in the first round of the playoffs with the multiple champions and heavy favorite CSU Asesoft Ploiesti, but even though they fought hard they were swept 2‚Äì0 in a three-game series. In the 2008‚Äì09 season the expectations were high for BC Mures and the fans were ecstatic for a new successful season but things did not go as they hoped. After only 5 games head coach Mihai Corui stepped down from his position, which was occupied by Lithuanian Audrius Prakuraitis. The season was a disappointing one although the team played a more organized basketball but in the end did not manage to enter the playoffs. The ownership was satisfied with Audrius Prakuraitis as head coach and brought him back for another year in the 2009‚Äì10 season. BC Mures this time relied mostly on European players, the only USA presence being the returning team captain JuJuan Cooley. The season was a fairly successful one for a well coached team that surprised a few top teams and in the end locked down the last spot to the playoffs. Here they would go head to head with U Mobitelco Cluj Napoca forcing the would-be champions that year into the decisive game in a 5-game series, where BC Mures was eliminated after a hard-fought game. For BC Mures the 2010‚Äì11 season marked what was the beginning of the climb to one of the elite teams of the Romanian National League. With the only familiar face being JuJuan Cooley the team went through a total overhaul, with a new coach in the person of Hungarian Deri Csaba and new players, whom clearly formed the best roster in the club's history until that point. BC Mures also debuted in their first European competition, in the regional Balkan International Basketball League, finishing with a 3‚Äì5 record but not advancing past the group stage. The high hopes that were put into this team were in most part confirmed, performing very well in the domestic league. BC Mures qualified for the first time in the Final-Four of the Romanian Cup which was held in their home arena but they failed to use this advantage finishing 4th. Although the wins rolled in the team showcased some weaknesses which resulted in a few unexpected losses that put them in the 5th seed at the end of the regular season. Not securing the home court advantage came as a blow to the team as they simply could not gather the necessary energy and motivation to win a single game in a five-game series in the first round of the playoffs in front of the newly promoted CSA Steaua Turabo Bucuresti, therefore prematurely ending a season in which the fans and also the ownership were sure they would at least go past the first round of the playoffs. Although the previous season ended in disappointment it was still the best performance in the club's history until that point so the core players and coach Deri Csaba were brought back and a few important names were added such as Romanian big guy Virgil Stanescu. The successful acquisitions gave the ownership enough confidence to set the objective for the 2011‚Äì12 season to reaching the finals. The players no doubt put together a group that was one of the best in the league but they never quite managed to play as a team which led to a few disappointing losses, overall even though the players were better the team performed worse than the previous season which determined the ownership to fire coach Deri Csaba mid season and bring in Serbian Srecko Sekulovic. The coach change proved to be an inspired one as the team's play improved significantly, Sekulovic leading BC Mures to a number of firsts in the club's history and winning some games, notably away games, that not a lot of people expected. The team finished strong but only managed to secure the 6th seed and were set to battle U Mobitelco Cluj-Napoca once again in the first round of the playoffs. Even though the team was optimistic heading into the playoffs a few locker room problems led to the shocking departure of team captain and crowd hero JuJuan Cooley right before the first game of the playoffs. This departure left the team without a real point-guard and BC Mures struggled but managed to win one game in a five-game series. Even though the playoffs followed the same disappointing story of the previous seasons BC Mures had won a valuable coach in the person of Srecko Sekulovic who was signed for another season in which he had full control over the player selection. Once again the team suffered a full overhaul only one player surviving the previous season, new team captain Liviu Dumitru. Changes were made at the ownership level too Szalkay Jozsef leaving his president position to Cornel Lungu. As the season approached the acquisitions did not leave a strong impact for the fans and the objective was set to reaching the playoffs, which also did not give much hopes of a good season. It was the first time in club's history that the roster did not include a USA player, the team relying on a more organized basketball and players who fight hard on the court. The first game of the regular season came and it brought a loss which seemed to confirm the fans fears that the team was not as good as the ones in the previous season. BC Mures bounced back hard though and unexpectedly won a game on the champions CSU Asesoft Ploiest home court which started a 6-game winning streak that proved all the doubters wrong and had the fans dazzled. As the regular season went on the team started to perform better and better each day went by. BC Mures went on an 8-game winning streak to finish off the regular season and clinched the 1st seed in the last game day after CSM Oradea the leaders for 29 legs lost their last game. It was an unbelievable performance considering the fact that it came when not even the most optimistic fan expected it. BC Mures was set to finally advance from the first round of the playoff which they did winning 3‚Äì1 a five-game series, but the fans were still reserved in what was to come next, being aware that there are teams in the playoff that were considered better. Things got even more positive for BC Mures though as they swept the second round of the playoffs winning 3‚Äì0 in a five-game series, eliminating CS Gaz Metan Media≈ü. What seemed to be a far away dream for the BC Mures fans became reality and the city rejoiced as they were getting ready to battle eight-time champions in the past nine seasons and rivals CSU Asesoft Ploiest. BC Mures won the first game of the finals but the back to back game schedule was tough, for the squad formed of older players and they fell short in the second game giving the game to Ploiesti. In the third game of the seven game series BC Mures showcased its incredible offensive abilities, dropping 13 three-pointers blowing out CSU Asesoft Ploiesti. Having done what they needed to send the game back to Mures, they couldn't bring the same offensive fire in the next day and Ploiesti tied the series 2‚Äì2. The pressure was huge for BC Mures who had to protect their home court in game five but the long and tough series seemed to slow the team down a bit as they made some mistakes in the final minutes which cost them huge, losing a must-win game. Ploiesti, the experienced team had the chance to close out the series on their home court and even though BC Mures fought hard until the last seconds they were outlasted and thus the incredible season for BC Mures ended and they had to be satisfied with the second place. At the return from Ploiesti the players were welcomed by a big number of fans who awarded them with gold medals signifying that for them they are the real champions, something that also seemed to be a general thought around the league.Total Baschet. \\"BC Mures News\\" After the incredible season BC Mures' focus in the 2013‚Äì14 season was resigning coach Srecko Sekulovic for another two years and also bringing back the players who had a major contribution to the 2012‚Äì13 run. The team followed the same successful recipe, relying on European players and they signed a couple of important and experienced players who played in the LNBM, who along with last years players formed a team just as strong if not stronger than previous seasons vice champion team. BC Mures also debuted in a continental Europe competition, EuroChallenge where they delivered a huge upset in the first game day winning on the home court of heavy favorite BC Tsmoki-MinskFIBA Europe \\"Victorious Welcome To Europe For Mures\\"  2012‚Äì13 season  The 2012‚Äì13 season was a great season for the team.

In the first round the team won with 3‚Äì1 against CSM Bucharest, and won in the second round against Romanian Cup Winners: CS Gaz Metan Medias with 3‚Äì0. In the final the team lost against CSU Asesoft Ploiesti with 4‚Äì2. But this performance gave the team an opportunity to play in the EuroChallenge for the 2013‚Äì14 season.

History  Kirti Mandir Front View It was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of the Gaekwad dynasty of the Marathas to perpetuate the glorious memory of his beloved ancestors. The sun, the moon and the earth in bronze with the undivided map of India adorn the shikhara of Kirti Mandir. It was built in 1936 as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. The temple houses five wall paintings by artist Nandalal Bose showing various phases of battle of Mahabharata, and some episodes from Indian mythology. The city of Vadodara, also popularly known as Baroda, used to be the seat of the Gaekwad or Gaikwad monarchs. It was formerly called by many names. The city was referred to as Chandravati, then Viravati, and Vadpatra due to the great quantity of banyan trees on the River banks of Vishwamitri. Kirti Mandir is situated in the city of Vadodara .It is a collection of temples built by Sayajirao Maharajah near the Vishwamitra Bridge of the city. It is believed that Sayajirao Maharaja built this Kirti Mandir in the memory of deceased members of the royal Gaekwad family and the edifice is dedicated to Lord Mahadev. Today it is a major tourist attraction in the city.  Architecture  The outstanding stone building is constructed in the shape of a letter \\"E\\" with terraces, balconies, domes and a central shikhara that rises to approximately 35 metres. The interiors of the Kirti Mandir are marble treated and brilliantly decorated with intricately carved murals. The walls of the central hall are adorned with many impressive murals such as the Gangavataran, Life of Meera, battle of Mahabharat and Natir Poojan which are all very well preserved works from the renowned Bengali artist Nandalal Bose. Statues as well as precious photographs of eminent members of the Gaekwad family are also displayed for public viewing. According to annals of history, the golden era in the Maratha rule of Baroda commenced when Sayajirao Maharaja came into power in 1875. The Kirti Mandir of Baroda was built at the cost of Rs.50,000, it preserves in its various rooms the statues and photographs of the members of the royal family. The interior of this elegant structure is marble finished and on the walls of the central hall are the murals Gangavataran, battle of Mahabharat, Life of Meera and Natir Pooja-executed by the famous Bengali artist Nandalal Bose. . The Kirti Mandir in Vadodara is actually a cluster of temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temples were constructed by His Highness Maharaj Sayajirao Gaekwad in 1936, on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Also known as the Temple of Fame, it is situated near the picturesque Vishwamitra Bridge of the city, in the memory of deceased members of the royal Gaekwad family. The marble treated interiors of the Kirti Mandir is wonderfully decorated with intricately carved murals. The characteristic ‚Äòshikhara‚Äô of this statuesque monument represents the sun, the moon and the earth in bronze with the undivided map of India.

Natural gas power stations generate a quarter of world electricity and a significant part of global greenhouse gas emissions and thus global warming. However they can provide seasonal dispatchable generation to balance variable renewable energy where hydropower or interconnectors are not available. Basic concepts: heat into mechanical energy into electrical energy A gas-fired power plant is a type of fossil fuel power station in which chemical energy stored in natural gas, which is mainly methane, is converted successively into: thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy. Although they cannot exceed the Carnot cycle limit for conversion of heat energy into useful work the excess heat may be used in cogeneration plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale. Plant types Simple cycle gas- turbine In a simple cycle gas-turbine, also known as open cycle gas- turbine(OCGT), hot gas drives a gas turbine to generate electricity. This type of plant is relatively cheap to build and can start very quickly, but due to its lower efficiency is at most is only run for a few hours a day as a peaking power plant. Combined cycle gas-turbine (CCGT)  CCGT power plants consist of simple cycle gas-turbines which use the Brayton cycle, followed by a heat recovery steam generator and a steam turbine which use the Rankine cycle. The most common configuration is two gas-turbines supporting one steam turbine. They are more efficient than simple cycle plants and can achieve efficiencies slightly over 60% and dispatch times of around half an hour. Reciprocating engine Reciprocating internal combustion engines tend to be under 20MW, so much smaller than other types of natural gas-fired electricity generator, and are typically used for emergency power or to balance variable renewable energy such as wind and solar. Greenhouse gas emissions Gas-fired power stations emit about 500g of per kWh of electricity generated. This is about half that of coal-fired power stations but in general more than ten times that of nuclear power and renewable energy. Life-cycle emissions generally show a similar pattern, unless skewed by methane emissions such as from gas leaks. Carbon capture very few power plants have carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and utilization. Hydrogen Gas- fired power plants can be modified to run on hydrogen and according to General Electric a more economically viable option than CCS would be to use more and more hydrogen in the gas turbine fuel. Hydrogen can at first be created from natural gas through steam reforming, or by heating to precipitate carbon, as a step towards a hydrogen economy, thus eventually reducing carbon emissions. Economics New plants Sometimes a new battery storage power station together with solar power or wind power is cheaper in the long-term than building a new gas plant, as the gas plant risks becoming a stranded asset. Existing plants a few gas-fired power plants are being retired because they are unable to stop and start quickly enough. However, despite the falling cost of variable renewable energy most existing gas-fired power plants remain profitable, especially in countries without a carbon price, due to their dispatchable generation and because shale gas and liquefied natural gas prices have fallen since they were built. Even in places with a carbon price, such as the EU, existing gas-fired power stations remain economically viable, partly due to increasing restrictions on coal-fired power because of its pollution. Politics Even when replacing coal power the decision to build a new plant may be controversial.

The reason for the rebellion was the coercive introduction of potato cultivation. The government selected the best fertile sections for potatoes from peasant lands. Authorities enforced brutal punishments for the non- fulfillment of the orders and assessed different requisitions. In 1834 unrest flared up in Vyatsky and Vladimir provinces, but it reached its height among the state peasants in 1840‚Äì44. Riots appeared simultaneously and they were partly in response to Pavel Kiselyov's reforms of state villages (1837‚Äì41). In the provinces of Ural and the lower Volga Region more than 500,000 peasants rose up destroying sowings of potatoes, and thrashing officials. They arbitrarily re-elected wardens, and attacked punitive detachments with weapons. Aside from ethnic Russians, participants in the riots included the Mari population, Chuvashes, Udmurts, Tatars, and Komi. The government sent troops to suppress the riots. In a number of places, peasants were shot. Thousands of rebels were convicted, and exiled into Siberia or forcibly drafted as soldiers. The eschatological rumours associating potato planting with the service to the Antichrist has also contributed to the magnitude of the disturbances.–•–æ–ª–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –∏ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—Ñ–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –±—É–Ω—Ç—ã –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω—ã XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞ –∫–∞–∫ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ See also * List of food riots References *Tokarev SV, peasant revolts, potato, Kirov, 1939; *Druzhinin, NM, State peasants and reform PD Kiselev, V. 2, Moscow, 1958, pp. 456‚Äì524; *Peasant Movement in Russia in 1826‚Äì1849 years.

The main estate house is a sprawling stone French Renaissance structure with lavish interior decoration. The estate's surviving outbuildings include a boathouse and a caretaker's house, the latter located across Warwick Neck Avenue from the main estate. Aldrich's heirs sold the property to the Roman Catholic church in 1939, and it was adapted for use as a seminary. It now serves as the main campus of the Overbrook Academy, a Catholic girls' school. The property now known as \\"The Aldrich Mansion\\" still belongs to the Diocese of Providence, and is now available as a site for weddings, formal occasions, business conferences, etc. It is also occasionally used for film and television productions. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  Brief history  The estate was originally built and owned by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and consisted of over 225 acres. The construction of the estate began in 1896 and was completed some 16 years later. In 1901, his daughter, Abby Aldrich, married John D. Rockefeller, Jr. at the mansion. In 1939, the Senator‚Äôs heirs transferred the Aldrich Mansion and 100 acres to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence for approximately $75,000. From 1946-1983, Our Lady of Providence Seminary was housed at the Aldrich Mansion.http://olpseminary.com/history.html In 1955, a 100,000+ sq. ft. school was built to house the Seminary.

The Battle of Sedjenane was fought during World War II between the Allies and Axis for control of a town in northern Tunisia, on the railway line to Mateur and the port of Bizerta. The battle was part of the Tunisia Campaign. First battle of Sedjenane, February‚ÄìMarch 1943 The town became of strategic importance during the Allied invasion of North Africa in World War II. Following the initial landings of Operation Torch, the Allied run for Tunis was halted by German paratroops (operating in the ground role) in the hills east of the town in November 1942. British troops of the 8th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, part of 36th Brigade of British 78th Division, were ambushed as they advanced on the road through the hills on November 29, 1942 and their wrecked Universal Carriers in No man's land became a grim symbol of the ensuing stalemate to Allied troops over the following several months of the Tunisia Campaign. These dominant hills, known to the Allies, as \\"Green Hill\\", \\"Baldy\\" and \\"Sugarloaf\\" were a barrier to further Allied advances in the north through to February 1943. Alan Moorehead a war correspondednt wrote in African Trilogy (1944), On February 26, 1943, the Germans broke the stalemate with Operation Ochsenkopf (Ox Head) offensive, a complementary blow to the Kasserine Pass offensive earlier that month. In a subsidiary operation Unternehmen Ausladung, the Axis attempted to outflank the British troops in Sedjenane and on the high ground opposite \\"Green Hill\\", with an attack on the hilly coastal strip to the north between the town and Cap Serrat, which was only lightly held by poorly-equipped French troops of the Corps Franc d'Afrique. The German advance, led by Colonel Rudolf Witzig's Parachute Engineer Battalion, was held by a series of counter-attacks by the 16th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, of 139th Brigade of British 46th Division, and two troops of No. 1 Commando on February 27, 1943, supported by the 70th Field and 5th Medium Regiments, Royal Artillery. 16 DLI mounted a further, disastrous counter-attack at dawn on March 2, 1943 in which it suffered severe casualties. That afternoon, the Germans also successfully advanced from the east towards Sedjenane and broke through the ranks of the 5th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters, also of 139th Brigade. According to Associated Press war correspondent Don Whitehead, an Italian infantry battalion (from the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment) supported by 30 tanks counterattacked in the British sector on 3 March, but lost half its strength killed to machine-gun fire.Combat Reporter: Don Whitehead's World War II Diary and Memoirs, p. 125, Fordham Univ Press, 2006 The 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, of 138th Brigade of 46th Division, several Churchill tanks of the North Irish Horse, of 25th Army Tank Brigade, plus elements of No. 1 Commando and 16 DLI were involved in the defence of the town, which finally fell to the Germans and Italians on March 4. Second battle of Sedjenane, April‚ÄìMay 1943 The town was retaken by the Allies on April 1, 1943. The several Allied counter-attacks through March 1943, to first stem the German advance and then to retake Sedjenane, represented the first time that British and German parachute troops had fought each other. The use of the term 'Red Devil' to describe a British paratrooper reputedly has its origins in these engagements, fought by men of the 1st Parachute Brigade. American forces took over the positions in the Sedjenane area and in front of 'Green Hill' on April 12, 1943 through to the conclusion of the North African Campaign in May 1943. U.S. Army Sergeant William L Nelson, H Company, 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 9th Infantry Division, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Djebel Dardys, northwest of Sedjenane, on April 24, 1943. The 2nd Battalion, 60th infantry Regiment also received a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions on April 23 and 24.

Medical tests such as, physical and visual exams, diagnostic imaging, genetic testing, chemical and cellular analysis, relating to clinical chemistry and molecular diagnostics, are typically performed in a medical setting. Types of tests By purpose Medical tests can be classified by their purposes, the most common of which are diagnosis, screening and evaluation. Diagnostic Lung scintigraphy evaluating lung cancer A diagnostic test is a procedure performed to confirm or determine the presence of disease in an individual suspected of having a disease, usually following the report of symptoms, or based on other medical test results.Harvard.edu Guide to Diagnostic Tests from Harvard Health This includes posthumous diagnosis. Examples of such tests are: * Using nuclear medicine to examine a patient suspected of having a lymphoma. * Measuring the blood sugar in a person suspected of having diabetes mellitus after periods of increased urination. * Taking a complete blood count of an individual experiencing a high fever to check for a bacterial infection. * Monitoring electrocardiogram readings on a patient suffering chest pain to diagnose or determine any heart irregularities.Harvard.edu Screening Screening refers to a medical test or series of tests used to detect or predict the presence of disease in at risk individuals within a defined group such as a population, family, or workforce.Osha.gov US Dept. of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Admin. Screenings may be performed to monitor disease prevalence, manage epidemiology, aid in prevention, or strictly for statistical purposes. Examples of screenings include measuring the level of TSH in the blood of a newborn infant as part of newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism, checking for Lung cancer in non-smoking individuals who are exposed to second-hand smoke in an unregulated working environment, and Pap smear screening for prevention or early detection of cervical cancer. Monitoring Some medical tests are used to monitor the progress of, or response to medical treatment. By method Most test methods can be classified into one of the following broad groups: *Patient observations, which may be photographed or recorded * Questions asked when taking an individual's medical history * Tests performed in a physical examination * Radiologic tests, in which, for example, x-rays are used to form an image of a body target. These tests often involve administration of a contrast agent. * In vivo diagnostics which test in the body, such as: ** ManometryOSA  Design of a high-sensor count fibre optic manometry catheter for in-vivo colonic diagnostics ** Administering a diagnostic agent and measuring the body's response, as in the gluten challenge test, contraction stress test, bronchial challenge test, oral food challenge, or the ACTH stimulation test. * ' which test a sample of tissue or bodily fluids,Directive 98/79/CE on in vitro diagnostic medical devices such as: **Liquid biopsy **Microbiological culturing, which determines the presence or absence of microbes in a sample from the body, and usually targeted at detecting pathogenic bacteria. **Genetic testing ** Blood Glucose testing ** Liver function testing **Calcium testing ** Testing for electrolytes in the blood, such as Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, and Urea By sample location In vitro tests can be classified according to the location of the sample being tested, including: *Blood tests *Urine tests, including naked eye exam of the urine *Stool tests, including naked eye exam of the feces *Sputum (phlegm), including naked eye exam of the sputum Accuracy and precision *Accuracy of a laboratory test is its correspondence with the true value. Accuracy is maximized by calibrating laboratory equipment with reference material and by participating in external quality control programs. *Precision of a test is its reproducibility when it is repeated on the same sample. An imprecise test yields widely varying results on repeated measurement. Precision is monitored in laboratory by using control material. Detection and quantification Tests performed in a physical examination are usually aimed at detecting a symptom or sign, and in these cases, a test that detects a symptom or sign is designated a positive test, and a test that indicated absence of a symptom or sign is designated a negative test, as further detailed in separate section below. A quantification of a target substance, a cell type or another specific entity is a common output of, for example, most blood tests. This is not only answering if a target entity is present or absent, but also how much is present. In blood tests, the quantification is relatively well specified, such as given in mass concentration, while most other tests may be quantifications as well although less specified, such as a sign of being \\"very pale\\" rather than \\"slightly pale\\". Similarly, radiologic images are technically quantifications of radiologic opacity of tissues. Especially in the taking of a medical history, there is no clear limit between a detecting or quantifying test versus rather descriptive information of an individual. For example, questions regarding the occupation or social life of an individual may be regarded as tests that can be regarded as positive or negative for the presence of various risk factors, or they may be regarded as \\"merely\\" descriptive, although the latter may be at least as clinically important. Positive or negative The result of a test aimed at detection of an entity may be positive or negative: this has nothing to do with a bad prognosis, but rather means that the test worked or not, and a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. For example, a negative screening test for breast cancer means that no sign of breast cancer could be found (which is in fact very positive for the patient). The classification of tests into either positive or negative gives a binary classification, with resultant ability to perform bayesian probability and performance metrics of tests, including calculations of sensitivity and specificity. Continuous values Tests whose results are of continuous values, such as most blood values, can be interpreted as they are, or they can be converted to a binary ones by defining a cutoff value, with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff. Interpretation In the finding of a pathognomonic sign or symptom it is almost certain that the target condition is present, and in the absence of finding a sine qua non sign or symptom it is almost certain that the target condition is absent. In reality, however, the subjective probability of the presence of a condition is never exactly 100% or 0%, so tests are rather aimed at estimating a post-test probability of a condition or other entity. Most diagnostic tests basically use a reference group to establish performance data such as predictive values, likelihood ratios and relative risks, which are then used to interpret the post-test probability for an individual. In monitoring tests of an individual, the test results from previous tests on that individual may be used as a reference to interpret subsequent tests. Risks Some medical testing procedures have associated health risks, and even require general anesthesia, such as the mediastinoscopy. Other tests, such as the blood test or pap smear have little to no direct risks. Medical tests may also have indirect risks, such as the stress of testing, and riskier tests may be required as follow-up for a (potentially) false positive test result. Consult the health care provider (including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) prescribing any test for further information. Indications Each test has its own indications and contraindications. An indication is a valid medical reason to perform the test. A contraindication is a valid medical reason to reject the test. For example, a basic cholesterol test may be indicated (medically appropriate) for a middle-aged person. However, if the same test was performed on that person very recently, then the existence of the previous test is a contraindication for the test (a medically valid reason to not perform it). Information bias is the cognitive bias that causes healthcare providers to order tests that produce information that they do not realistically expect or intend to use for the purpose of making a medical decision. Medical tests are indicated when the information they produce will be used. For example, a screening mammogram is not indicated (not medically appropriate) for a woman who is dying, because even if breast cancer is found, she will die before any cancer treatment could begin. In a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its net benefit for that individual. Tests are chosen when the expected benefit is greater than the expected harm. The net benefit may roughly be estimated by: b_n = \\\\Delta p \\\\times r_i \\\\times ( b_i - h_i ) - h_t , where: *bn is the net benefit of performing a test *Œõp is the absolute difference between pre- and posttest probability of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. A major factor for such an absolute difference is the power of the test itself, such as can be described in terms of, for example, sensitivity and specificity or likelihood ratio. Another factor is the pre- test probability, with a lower pre-test probability resulting in a lower absolute difference, with the consequence that even very powerful tests achieve a low absolute difference for very unlikely conditions in an individual (such as rare diseases in the absenceower can make a great difference for highly suspected conditions. The probabilities in this sense may also need to be considered in context of conditions that are not primary targets of the test, such as profile-relative probabilities in a differential diagnostic procedure. *ri is the rate of how much probability differences are expected to result in changes in interventions (such as a change from \\"no treatment\\" to \\"administration of low-dose medical treatment\\"). For example, if the only expected effect of a medical test is to make one disease more likely compared to another, but the two diseases have the same treatment (or neither can be treated), then, this factor is very low and the test is probably without value for the individual in this aspect. *bi is the benefit of changes in interventions for the individual *hi is the harm of changes in interventions for the individual, such as side effects of medical treatment *ht is the harm caused by the test itself. Some additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not included: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with subsequent test (such as an abdominal palpation potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent abdominal auscultation), time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings. In some cases, tests being performed are expected to have no benefit for the individual being tested. Instead, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals. Patients may give informed consent to undergo medical tests that will benefit other people. Patient expectations In addition to considerations of the nature of medical testing noted above, other realities can lead to misconceptions and unjustified expectations among patients. These include: Different labs have different normal reference ranges; slightly different values will result from repeating a test; \\"normal\\" is defined by a spectrum along a bell curve resulting from the testing of a population, not by \\"rational, science-based, physiological principles\\"; sometimes tests are used in the hope of turning something up to give the doctor a clue as to the nature of a given condition; and imaging tests are subject to fallible human interpretation and can show \\"incidentalomas\\", most of which \\"are benign, will never cause symptoms, and do not require further evaluation,\\" although clinicians are developing guidelines for deciding when to pursue diagnoses of incidentalomas.

The Ogasawara acted as shugo (governors) of Shinano Province in the medieval period (c. 1185‚Äì1600), and as daimy≈ç (feudal lords) of territories on Ky≈´sh≈´ during the Edo period (1600‚Äì1867). During the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the clan controlled Shinano province, while related clans controlled the provinces of Awa, Bizen, Bitch≈´, Iwami, Mikawa, T≈çt≈çmi and Mutsu. According to some theories, the Miyoshi clan and the Mizukami clan were descendants of the Ogasawara clan. The clan developed a number of schools of martial arts during this period, known as Ogasawara-ry≈´, and contributed to the codification of bushido etiquette. Ogasawara karaetendo (CA); Ogasawara karaetendo (GA). Towards the end of the Sengoku period (late 16th century), the clan opposed both Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. During the Edo period, the Ogasawara were identified as one of the fudai or insider daimy≈ç clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa,Alpert, Georges. (1888). Ancien Japon, p.75. in contrast with the tozama or outsider clans. Ogasawara clan branches The fudai Ogasawara clan originated in 12th century Shinano Province. They claim descent from Takeda Yoshikiyo and the Seiwa-Genji. Broadly, there are two genealogical lines of the Ogasawara, the Matsuo and the Fukashi, each of which identify places in Shinano. The Matsuo line gave rise to the Ogasawara of Echizen, and the Fukashi line is ultimately established at the Ogasawara of Bunzen.Varley, Paul. (1967). The Onin War: History of Its Origins and Background with a Selective Translation of the Chronicle of ≈ånin, p. 81 n23. The great grandson of Yoshikiyo, Nagakiyo, was the first to take the name Ogasawara. The area controlled by his descendants grew to encompass the entire province of Shinano.Papinot, p. 44. Nagakiyo's grandson, (1569‚Äì1615), served Ieyasu; and in 1590, Hidemasa received Koga Domain (20,000 koku) in Shim≈çsa Province. In 1601, Ieyasu transferred Hidemasa to Iida Domain (50,000 koku) in Shinano; then, in 1613, he was able to return to the home of his forebears, Fukashi Castle (80,000 koku), now known as Matsumoto Castle.Rowthorn, Chris. (2005). Japan, p. 245; Wa-pedia web site The branches of the fudai Ogasawara clan include the following: * The senior branch of the Ogasawara from the beginning were daimy≈ç at Fukashi; then, in 1617, the daimy≈ç was transferred to Akashi Domain (120,000 koku) in Harima Province. In the years spanning 1632 through 1868, the descendants of this branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç at Kokura Domain (150,000 koku)Papinot, p. 45; \\"Kokura Castle,\\" Kitakyushu Bridges, p. 2; Kokura Castle. in Buzen Province.

The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * A cadet branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç in 1617 at Tatsuno Domain in Harima Province; and in 1632, they were transferred as daimy≈ç at Nakatsu Domain in Buzen Province. In the period spanning the years 1716 through 1868, the descendants of this branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç at Anshi Domain (10,000 koku) in Harima Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * A cadet branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç in 1632 at Kizuki Domain in Bungo Province; in 1645 at Yoshida Domain in Mikawa Province; in 1697 at Iwatsuki Domain in Musashi Province; in 1711 at Kakegawa Domain in T≈çt≈çmi Province; and in 1747 at Tanakura Domain in Mutsu Province. Finally, in the years spanning 1817 through 1868, the descendants of this branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç at Karatsu Domain (60,000 koku) in Hizen Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * A cadet branch of the Ogasawara claim a line of descent from Takeda Yoshikiyo and also descent from Ogasawara Sadamune who had joined Nitta Yoshisada in overthrowing the H≈çj≈ç at Kamakura in the 14th century. This same Sadamune had been a general under Ashikaga Takauji.Varley, p. 80 n21. This branch of the Ogasawara were established in 1590 at Honj≈ç Domain in Musashi Province; in 1608 at Koga Domain in Shim≈çsa Province; in 1619 at Sekiyado Domain in Shim≈çsa province; and in 1637 at Takasu Domain in Mino Province. In the years spanning 1691 through 1868, this branch of the Ogasawara were daimy≈ç at Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (22,000 koku)Papinot, p. 45; Kitakyushu, Journal of Occupational Health ‚Äì Ogasawara bone sample spectrometry in Echizen Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. Ogasawara-Miyoshi line The Miyoshi clan of daimy≈ç were cadet descendants of the Ogasawara; and through them, they were also descendants of the Seiwa-Genji Minamoto.Papinot, Jacques. (2003). Nobiliare du Japon ‚Äì Miyoshi, p. 35. At the beginning of the 14th century, Ogasawara Nagafusa established himself in Shikoku. Amongst his descendants in the 8th generation was Yoshinaga, who established himself at Miyoshi in Awa province (now Tokushima Prefecture). Osagawa Yoshinaga took the name Miyoshi Yoshinaga and became a vassal of the Hosokawa clan, who were then the strongest force on the island. Accounts from the late 16th century include mention of Miyoshi Yoshitsugu as the nephew and adopted son of Miyoshi Ch≈çkei. Any remnants of the Miyoshi branch of the Ogasawara clan would have been vanquished by the Ch≈çsokabe clan as they gradually took control of the entire island of Shikoku.

It lies near the County Kilkenny border where the R430 regional road crosses the R426. The village lies within the townland of Slatt (Lower), in the civil parish of Rathaspick. Features The village is linear, developed along the regional road (R430) to Carlow. The Swan has a low level of services and facilities. No definite village centre exists and the village is serviced with a public house only. No shops are available. This is a purely residential community with some institutional uses. The Community Centre in the centre of the village is used by local groups and caters for a wide catchment area. History The Swan is one of the newest villages in Laois and is named after a local public house, The Swan Inn. In 1935, to create employment, a fire clay factory was opened because of local fire clay deposits while coal deposits provided a local energy source. Local population is Economy Fleming's brick factory at The Swan Fleming's Fireclays was started by PJ Fleming in 1935. It generated employment for the village and the surrounding areas and provided housing for many of its workers. These houses constituted nearly all the dwellings in the village until 2003, when two new housing projects began and the number of houses has almost doubled as a result. The factory utilises fireclay, which is an abundant local resource, to make bricks and chimney flues. The factory was rebranded as Lagan Brick when Flemings Fireclay was absorbed into the Lagan Group. Education The Swan National School is the local primary school. Sport St Josephs GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and takes its players from Luggacurren, Wolfhill and Ballyadams. Some players of note from the Swan have included Tom Kelly and Joe Higgins, both of whom received GAA All Stars Awards in 2003. Joe Higgins also brought boxing glory to the village with a total of 9 Leinster Titles and 2 All-Irelands.Laois Nationalist.

Coster was the fifth child of Adriaen Lennaertz, sexton and carpenter, and Aeltgen Jansd. By around 1605, he was a member of the Amsterdam rederijkerskamer \\"De Eglantier\\". Presumably he was helped into the society by rich friends, but then got himself to Leiden University in 1607. He began as a student of the humanities, but he graduated in 1610 as a doctor in medicine. He was appointed a physician at the Hospital on his return to Amsterdam. Coster for 10 years played a leading role in the literary life of Amsterdam, making his name in the theatre. \\"Teeuwis de boer\\" (Teeuwis the farmer), a comedy in all probability already written during his years in Leiden, was in 1612 put on by \\"De Eglantier\\". Inspired by the national anthem, Coster laid out in it comical motives and characters: a voluptuous man married with an old woman, a farmer opposite a city-dweller, a bragging Westfaals talking with a bald nobleman, and a sly and knowing French lawyer. In 1613 the \\"Spel van Tiisken vander Schilden\\" (Play of Tiisken vander Schilden) appeared, at first anonymous but later attributed to Coster on the basis of stylistic resemblance with other works of his. The first 'classical' tragedy in Dutch has been written also by Coster: \\"Ithys\\", probably put on by \\"Eglantier\\" in 1615. Although largely in the pastoral style, it is an extremely bloody drama, take from one of the cruellest episodes in Ovid's Metamorphoses: the story of Tereus and Procne. Around 1615, the \\"De Eglantier\\" began to break up, with pressures from old versus new, Dutch versus foreign, self-praise versus critical talent. Hooft's attempts to reconstruct it came to nothing. The final break came in 1617, when a small group of talented members led by Coster, Hooft and Bredero split off to found the 'Duytsche Academy'. The intention was to practice not only poetry and theatre, but also to organize scientific research lectures in Dutch, unlike the universities of Leiden, Franeker, Harderwijk and Groningen, which gave their classes at that time in Latin. In November 1617, a new classical drama of Coster was performed: \\"Iphigenia\\". The drama was a disguised criticism of the current religious disputes and fanatical drive of the Calvanistic preachers, making these preachers protest to the mayor of Amsterdam and getting him to declare (wrongly) that the Academie was anticlerical. Successful productions of plays like Bredero's \\"Spaanschen Brabander\\" and Hooft's \\"Warenar\\" could do nothing to change this. The death of Bredero in August 1618, combined with tragic political events that very same month and the execution of Oldenbarnevelt in May 1619, limited the Academy's chances. Samuel Coster, 18th century engraving by Jacobus Houbraken Due to his medical work, that took up much of his time, Coster published little in later years, besides revising and reprinting his earlier works. He remained friendly with the aforenamed Amsterdam literary circles, and so the Academy's objectives were finally realised in 1632 and 1637, with the foundation of the Athenaeum Illustre and the new Theater ‚Äì not founded by Coster himself, but by a younger generation realizing his aims.

The debate began when linguists Paul Postal, \\"Haj\\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James McCawley ‚Äî self-dubbed the \\"four horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" ‚Äî proposed an alternative theory of generative semantics, which essentially flipped Chomsky's theory of generative grammar on its head by focusing on semantics rather than syntax as the basis of Chomsky's concept of deep structure. While Chomsky and other generative grammarians argued that the meaning of a sentence was derived from its structure, the generative semanticists argued that the structure of a sentence was derived from its meaning. Eventually, generative semantics spawned an alternative linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate the understanding of language with the concepts of cognitive psychology, such as memory, perception and categorization. While generative grammarians operate on the premise that the mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures and -- more significantly -- that the cognitive abilities used to process this data are similar to those used in other non-linguistic tasks.  Book  The Linguistics Wars is the title of a 1993 book by Randy Allen Harris on the topic. It touches on the issues of the dispute involving Chomsky and other significant individuals (Lakoff, Postal, etc.) and also highlights how certain theories evolved and which of their important features have influenced modern-day linguistic theories.

The only approach to the chapel is on footpaths across fields from the A41 road. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History Deeds dated 1349 refer to a chapel on this site which was a chapel of ease to St Oswald's Church, Malpas. A document dated 1621 refers to it as Chadwick Chapel, although by 1636 another document called it Chad Chapel. It was rebuilt in 1689‚Äì91 and has been little changed since. The principal financial donations for the chapel were from John Dod, a London mercer who had been born in Tushingham. The chapel is now referred to as Old Chad because its functions have been replaced by St Chad's Church built in 1863 on the A41 road. Architecture Exterior The chapel is built in brown brick with a grey slate roof. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end with an external staircase leading to an internal west gallery. The body of the chapel is in three bays without aisles; it is furnished as a nave and a chancel. A vestry projects south from the west bay of the nave. The tower is small with a pyramid-roof. It has a west door with a loophole above it, a plain band at the belfry floor level, paired camber-headed bell-openings and a weathercock. Interior The roof is unusual in that the sections between the principal beams are filled with carvings making a star-like pattern. All the chapel furnishings are made from Cheshire oak. The holy table dates from the 17th century, and on each side of it are panelled family box pews. On the wall above the south pew are three marble memorials to the Vernon and Murhall families, and above the north pew is a marble memorial to the Stephens family. Above the two east windows is the royal coat of arms of George III. A low screen divides the chancel from the nave. The seating in the nave consists of plain seats and backs without any decoration. At the west end is a gallery which is reached by the external staircase. The font is Jacobean in style, and the pulpit is a three-decker. External features Adjacent to the church is a small building containing a horse-drawn hearse. It is built of brown brick with a pyramidal roof of grey slates and is dated 1822. The hearse-house is a Grade II listed building.

The origin of Superman is the story that relates Superman's arrival on Earth and the beginnings of his career as a superhero. The story has been through many revisions through decades of publication in comic books and radio, television and film adaptations. The original story was written by Jerry Siegel and illustrated by Joe Shuster, and published as a part of the character's first appearance in Action Comics #1 (June 1938). As more stories were published, more details about the original story were established. These stories explored individual details, such as the planet Krypton, the source of Superman's powers and his relationships with supporting characters. Because continuity was looser during the Golden Age and the Silver Age, many of these stories contradicted each other. As Superman was adapted into other media, his origin story has been frequently retold. These origin stories adhere to the basic framework created by Siegel and Shuster, with minor variations made to serve the plot or to appeal to contemporary audiences. Some of the details created for these adaptations influenced the origin story in the mainstream comic series. In more recent years, the origin story has been revamped in the comic books several times. In 1985, DC Comics published Crisis on Infinite Earths, which created the opportunity to definitively revise the history of the DC Universe. Superman's origin was subsequently retold in the 1986 limited series The Man of Steel, written and drawn by John Byrne. The story was later removed from continuity (\\"retconned\\") and replaced with the Superman: Birthright limited series in 2003 and 2004, written by Mark Waid and drawn by Leinil Francis Yu, as Superman's official origin. After the Infinite Crisis limited series in 2005 and 2006, Superman's origin was revised yet again, unfolding throughout Superman's regular publications and the Superman: Secret Origin mini-series in 2009 and 2010. Basic story While the individual details vary, certain key elements have remained consistent in almost all retellings. Superman is born Kal-El on the alien planet Krypton. His parents, Jor-El and Lara become aware of Krypton's impending destruction and Jor-El begins constructing a spacecraft to carry Kal-El to Earth. During Krypton's last moments, Jor-El places young Kal-El in the spacecraft and launches it. Jor-El and Lara die as the spacecraft barely escapes Krypton's fate. The explosion transforms planetary debris into kryptonite, a radioactive substance that is lethal to superpowered (as by Earth's yellow sun) Kryptonians. The spacecraft lands in the rural United States, where it is found by a passing motorist. Jonathan and Martha Kent adopt Kal-El and name him Clark Kent. As Clark grows up on Earth, he and his adoptive parents discover that he has superhuman powers. The Kents teach Clark to use these powers responsibly to help others and fight crime. Clark keeps his powers secret in order to protect his family and friends, who might be endangered by his criminal enemies. In order to use his powers to help humanity, Clark creates the alter ego of Superman. A number of elements are added to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent the casual observer from matching them. Superman wears a characteristic red and blue costume with a letter \\"S\\" emblem and a cape. Clark Kent takes to wearing glasses, styling his hair differently, changing his body language, significantly altering his voice, and wearing looser clothing and suits that hide his physique. Clark Kent moves to Metropolis and takes a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet, where he meets his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and editor Perry White. Superman becomes the subject of frequent headline stories written by Lois, and the two become romantically attracted to each other. Common variations Superman's public debut has differed throughout decades of publication. Originally, he first donned the costume and began fighting crime as an adult. Later, he was shown to have begun his heroic career as Superboy, changing his name to Superman after he grew up. The character's history as Superboy was retroactively erased from continuity in The Man of Steel retelling of the origin. In current continuity, Clark used his powers to aid others while still a youth, operating as \\"a rarely-glimpsed American myth ‚Äì the mysterious 'Super-Boy'\\". Influences Superman's origin was influenced by the science fiction stories appearing in pulp magazines that Siegel and Shuster were fond of and by a variety of social and religious themes. Siegel and Shuster created multiple characters named Superman. The first was a villain with telepathic powers, published in the short story \\"The Reign of the Superman\\". A later collaboration in 1934 with Russell Keaton has a Superman that is a meta-human sent back in time as an infant, where he is found and raised by Sam and Molly Kent. Yet another version, which was unpublished, was a crime fighter without any superhuman abilities, which Siegel and Shuster compare to another of their creations, Slam Bradley. They felt that a virtuous character originating from Earth to possess superhuman powers would make the character and stories seem less serious, inviting comparisons to humorous strongmen like Popeye. So they decided to make the third version, as a visitor from another planet. Siegel has cited the John Carter of Mars stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs as an influence on the source of Superman's strength and leaping ability being the lesser gravity of a smaller planet. Jack Williamson once remarked that Superman's origin had strong similarities to a story he had written and published early in his career, where a Martian scientist sent his infant daughter into space to save her from their planet's destruction. Superman carries some similarities to Hugo Danner, the main character in the novel Gladiator by Philip Wylie. Danner's great strength comes from a serum injected into him by his father while still a fetus which gave him the proportional strength of an insect. The scientific explanation for the source of Superman's powers published in Action Comics #1 also compared Superman's great strength to an ant's ability to carry hundreds of times its own weight and a grasshopper's ability to leap great distances. Wylie later threatened to sue National Comics for plagiarism. Siegel signed an affidavit that claimed Superman was not influenced by Gladiator, though he had reviewed the novel for his fanzine Science Fiction in 1932. Because Siegel and Shuster were both Jewish, some religious commentators and pop-culture scholars such as Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by Moses and other Jewish elements. However, Siegel and Shuster claim that having Superman drop out of the sky just seemed like a good idea. Publication history Pre-Crisis Superman's origin took more than twenty years to unfold into the narrative that is familiar today. During the Golden Age of Comics (1935‚Äì1953), Krypton and the Kents were almost incidental, seldom being referred to in the comic book stories. The Superman mythology expanded during the Silver Age of Comics (1953‚Äì1970) and was refined during the Bronze Age (1970‚Äì1986). Golden Age Siegel created, and Shuster designed, the character Superman in 1934 and intended to sell the character as a daily newspaper comic strip. They told Superman's origin over the course of twelve strips, ten of which detailed the planet Krypton. In 1938, DC Comics published Superman's debut in Action Comics #1, Siegel and Shuster were required to cut the story down to thirteen pages, and so the origin story was reduced to a single page. The story described a scientist on an unnamed doomed planet placing his infant son into a hastily designed spaceship and launching it toward Earth. When the spaceship lands, a passing motorist finds it and turns the child over to a local orphanage, where the staff is astounded by the child's feats of strength. As the child matures, he discovers more of his abilities and decides to use them for the benefit of mankind as Superman. The last panel of this origin is captioned \\"A Scientific Explanation of Clark Kent's Amazing Strength\\", explaining he \\"had come from a planet whose inhabitants' physical structure was millions of years advanced of our own\\". Kent's strength is then compared with ants' and grasshoppers' abilities to lift many times their body weight and leap great distances. Starting on January 16, 1939, Siegel's original stories and Shuster's original art work appeared in a daily newspaper comic strip through the McClure Syndicate. The first days of the Superman daily newspaper strip retold the origin in greater detail, focusing on his departure from Krypton. In this retelling, the planet Krypton and Superman's biological parents, Jor-L and Lara, are called by name for the first time. The first issue of Superman, published in 1939, also featured the origin story. Max Gaines had written to Siegel and Shuster and asked them to expand the origin sequence to two pages, and to include four pages that detailed how Clark Kent became a journalist as well as a full page feature that expanded on the scientific explanation for Superman's powers. In this issue, the passing motorists are revealed to be the Kents, who leave him at the local orphan asylum but later return to adopt him. The Kents teach Clark that he must keep his powers a secret but that he will someday use them to assist humanity. Clark becomes Superman after the Kents pass away and wins his job as a reporter for the Daily Star by delivering information he had gathered as Superman about a lynch mob at the county jail. The feature on Superman's powers asserts again that Kryptonians had evolved to physical perfection, but also reveals that because Earth is a smaller planet than Krypton, the lighter gravitational pull further enhanced Superman's strength. In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 introduced the concept of Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians did not appear to possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian on Earth would have them. In this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council scoffed at Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, if nobody else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son. For the tenth anniversary in 1948 of Superman's debut, Superman #53 retold the origin story, compiling and expanding upon previous versions, though the story does not acknowledge the adventures of Superboy. This story establishes the Kents as farmers and that \\"Clark\\" is a family name. Before Clark's adopted father dies, he tells Clark that he must use his powers to become a force for good. Clark's father calls Clark a \\"Super-Man\\", inspiring Clark to use the name. Superman discovered his alien origins for the first time in Superman #61. Action Comics #158 retold the origin again, this time acknowledging the adventures of Superboy. Silver Age After Mort Weisinger took over as editor of the Superboy comics in 1953, the mythology of Superman began growing, starting with the introduction of Superboy's pet Krypto the Superdog, the first survivor of Krypton in comics other than Kal-El himself. When Weisinger became editor of the entire Superman line in 1958, the Superman mythology began expanding even more rapidly. Producing over a hundred Superman stories a year, Weisinger aimed to introduce a new element to the character's mythology every six months. By this time, the basic elements of Superman's origin were in place, and Weisinger capitalized on it. Weisinger and his writers gave Superman history and family and constructed a world for readers to explore. Through flashbacks, imaginary stories and time travel, Superman comics in the Silver Age examined the implicit themes of Superman's origin as an orphan from another planet, while also providing explanations for many key story elements. In 1961, Superman #146 told the most complete version of the origin story to date, this time inserting references to other elements of the expanding Superman mythos, including Jor-El's warning to his brother Zor-El, father of Supergirl, about Krypton's fate and Krypto's launch into space. Bronze Age The stories published under Weisinger remained the basis for Superman's origin throughout the Bronze Age. But by the time Julius Schwartz took over as the editor of the Superman in 1970, continuity had strayed from the broader outline established in the 1960s. Schwartz relied on writer E. Nelson Bridwell, an expert in the fine details of the Superman mythology, to help refine the character's history. Bridwell explained to readers that many stories were no longer in continuity because they contradicted others, stating that, \\"It was decided that the only thing to do was to throw out part of the tales and work the rest into a consistent whole\\". Superman's origin was retold during this time in The Amazing World of Superman (Metropolis Edition), which adhered to the origin previously established in the Silver Age. Martin Pasko wrote Action Comics #500 (October 1979), which featured a history of the Superman canon as it existed at the time and was published in the Dollar Comics format. Jor-El's life, the destruction of Krypton and the launch of the rocket that carried Kal-El to Earth, are documented in The World of Krypton (vol. 1) limited series. Superman: The Secret Years tells the story of Clark Kent's college career in which Superboy leaves Smallville to attend college, and copes with problems that force his outlook to mature, ending with Superboy changing his heroic identity to Superman after defeating Lex Luthor's plot to destroy the world. Post- Crisis In the 1980s, editors at DC Comics felt that its characters and their history had become convoluted and confusing to casual readers. In 1985, DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rewrote the history of the DC Universe. DC had been planning to revamp Superman for some time, and Crisis gave the company freedom to reset the character from the very beginning. The Man of Steel In 1986, DC Comics hired writer and artist John Byrne, who had gained a reputation for re-energizing several Marvel Comics series, to write the relaunched Superman series and Action Comics. In addition to Byrne, managing editor and inker Dick Giordano, writer Marv Wolfman, artist Jerry Ordway and editor Andy Helfer recreated the Superman mythology from the ground up to appeal to modern audiences. This revamped origin was published in the six issue The Man of Steel limited series, written and pencilled by Byrne and inked by Giordano. The Man of Steel opened on Krypton, vastly different from the planet developed in the Weisinger era, just before its destruction. Byrne felt that Krypton had been \\"'stuck' in a 1930s Buck Rogers-like art style for decades\\" and Giordano and publisher Jenette Kahn agreed that he should redesign it. The people of Krypton were portrayed as living in a cold and heartless society. Though they were masters of science, they had repressed their emotions and passion for life. Superman learned of his alien heritage several years into his heroic career, but marginalized it in favor of his upbringing on Earth. Byrne's goal was to \\"pare away some of the barnacles that have attached themselves to the company's flagship title\\", and take Superman back to the basics. In this new continuity, the character was re-established as the last survivor of Krypton's destruction. Man of Steel also illustrated significant events in Superman's relationships, such as his first interview with Lois Lane and his first encounter with Gotham City's Batman. Lex Luthor was reinvented by Wolfman and portrayed as a corrupt business tycoon who hated Superman for exposing his unethical business practices. Superman's adoptive parents lived into his adulthood, providing hooks that Byrne felt made the character more human. Superman: Birthright In 2002, DC Comics Executive Editor Dan DiDio asked writer Mark Waid to reimagine Superman's origin, making the character relevant for the 21st century. After taking the assignment, Waid's goal was to present a definitive volume on Superman's origin that was familiar to longtime fans as well as casual readers who were more familiar with Superman through television and film adaptations than through comics. Starting in 2003, the new origin story was published in the twelve issue Superman: Birthright limited series, written by Waid and drawn by Leinil Francis Yu. During the early issues of the series, it was unclear if the story was intended to be the new origin of the mainstream Superman or the beginnings of a new universe, similar to Marvel's Ultimate line. DC later confirmed that Birthright was the new official origin of Superman, and it was embedded into the Superman fiction in Superman (vol. 2) #200. Krypton was redesigned again in Birthright, portrayed as a society that used its advanced science and technology to make its planet into a paradise. Clark Kent respected his alien heritage and designed his Superman costume based on images of Kryptonian culture that were sent along with him in his spacecraft to Earth. Birthright establishes that Lex Luthor grew up in Smallville and was good friends with Clark Kent. Inspired by the television series Smallville, Clark Kent's parents were portrayed as being similar to their television counterparts played by John Schneider and Annette O'Toole. Superman: Secret Origin Following the events of the Infinite Crisis limited series, DC Universe continuity was revamped in a way that both kept and altered previous elements in canon, and Superman's origin was no exception. The first revelations of this revised origin came only in bits and pieces. In Action Comics Annual #10 (2007), Krypton is shown to have characteristics that resemble the version that appears in the Richard Donner Superman films. In Action Comics #850, a more complete recap was presented: Krypto appears on Krypton, Jor-El's frustrations with the Council, Clark's awareness about being adopted during grade school, a friendship with Lex Luthor when they are both teenagers, Clark wearing glasses in his teens, using his powers to help people while not in costume, and showing Lois Lane trying to secure interviews with Superman and being friends with Clark. Finally, the Geoff Johns/Gary Frank Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes arc revealed that Clark's membership in the Legion of Super Heroes when he is a teenager is now back in canon. A complete tale of Superman's new origin was told in the Superman: Secret Origin limited series written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Gary Frank. Described as the \\"definitive\\" telling of the origin story of Superman, it features his life in Smallville, his first adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes as Superboy, and his arrival in Metropolis all told from Clark Kent's point of view. The New 52 In August 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity and launched a new line of comics after that year's Flashpoint event. While the new Superman series portrays Superman's current adventures, Action Comics began its run telling the story of Superman's early days in Metropolis. The story reintroduced many Golden Age concepts (Superman fighting political and social corruption, starting out with reduced powers, working at the Daily Star rather than the Daily Planet) and removed several aspects reintroduced in Secret Origin (Clark Kent and Lex Luthor as childhood friends and his career as Superboy, though the Legion of Superheroes still played a part in Clark Kent's childhood). The story focuses on a young, social crusading Superman in a makeshift costume (shortly before acquiring the redesigned costume by Jim Lee), fending off the attacks of the Army and their consultant Dr. Lex Luthor, as well as contending with public fear resulting from his sudden appearance and defiance of the authorities. Kal-El's escape from Krypton was depicted in Action Comics, vol. 2 #5. Krypton had built its society into a paradise. As Krypton begins to explode, Jor-El and Lara first consider escaping into the Phantom Zone with their son, but the portal to the zone is shattered by the convicts already there. Their last hope is to send Kal-El away in a prototype rocket, guided by Brainiac artificial intelligence to find planets with younger suns and weaker gravity. As the ship lands on Earth, the Kents are stuck on the side of the road with a flat tire, lamenting Martha's miscarriage earlier that month. They rescue Kal-El from the ship before the government arrives. The Kents slip past them by presenting the baby as their own and offering instead the body of a deformed calf as the alien occupant. His adoptive parents die in car accident when he is young. Ultimately, Superman meets and battles the Collector of Worlds, saving the Earth and receiving the public's trust as the world's first Super-Hero. DC Universe: Rebirth Following the comic book crossover event Convergence, it was revealed in the mini-series Superman: Lois and Clark that the pre-Flashpoint version of the character had survived the universal transition into the New 52 and was living on the new DC Universe's Earth with his wife, the pre-Flashpoint Lois Lane and their young son. After the indigenous New 52 Superman was killed, the pre- Flashpoint Superman became the DC Universe's primary version of the character once again. This brought the events of 2009's Secret Origin series back as the primary Superman's origin story once more. In 2017, the Superman and Action Comics titles crossed over for a story arc entitled Superman Reborn, which re- characterized what occurred in the New 52. After Flashpoint, the single consciousnesses of both Superman and Lois Lane were fractured in two by an unknown entity, explaining why the two incarnations were able to exist at the same time. Co-writer Dan Jurgens explained, \\"The events of Action #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them. And, yes, Clark and Lois are back at the Daily Planet. Not only does everyone know they had a child; they were there shortly after Jon was born. The Daily Planet crew has known Jon his entire life\\". Flashbacks seen in that story indicate that the origin as depicted in the New 52 and in Superman: Secret Origin have been hybridized, with most of the characters' pre-Flashpoint histories overwriting early New 52 stories. In 2019, the mini-series Doomsday Clock made further alterations to the origin of Superman in the modern DC Universe. While an early issue explained that the deaths of Jonathan and Martha Kent occurred in an automobile accident when Clark was an adolescent (explaining their absence from the New 52), the conclusion of the story saw that alterations to the timeline made by Doctor Manhattan led to Clark becoming Superboy at an early age, allowing him to save his parents from their fatal collision and remain alive well into Clark's adulthood. Other versions In the DC Comics Multiverse, there are several versions of Superman originating from different parallel Earths. Most of these counterparts have subtle differences in their origins. Alterations to Superman's origin are also frequently used as the premises for Elseworlds and imaginary stories published by DC Comics. Parallel earths Kal-L is the Superman of the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. His origin adheres to the basic origin, but he arrives on Earth early in the twentieth century and becomes active as a superhero in 1938. On his version of Krypton, all Kryptonians had superhuman abilities on their home planet due to the planet's greater gravitational pull. Kal-L never had a career as Superboy. The origin stories that appeared in Action Comics #1 and Superman #1 are attributed to Kal-L. Superboy-Prime comes from the pre-Crisis Earth-Prime. On this Earth, Kal-El is teleported to Earth moments before the planet Krypton is destroyed when its sun went supernova. Because Earth-Prime's Krypton was consumed by its sun, Kryptonite never comes into existence in this universe. Elseworlds In Superman: Red Son Superman's ship was launched by descendants of Lex Luthor and Lois Luthor in Earth's far future. The ship, travelling backward through time, lands on a Ukrainian collective farm rather than in Kansas. Instead of fighting for \\"... truth, justice, and the American Way\\", Superman is described in Soviet propaganda broadcasts \\"... as the Champion of the common worker who fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, socialism, and the international expansion of the Warsaw Pact\\". In Superman: Speeding Bullets Kal-El is found by Thomas and Martha Wayne, who decide to adopt the baby and name him Bruce. After Thomas and Martha are gunned down by a mugger, Bruce reacts by burning the mugger with his heat vision and discovers his superpowers. Years later, he decides to create a secret identity for himself as the Batman and starts to brutally strike back at the criminals in Gotham City. In JLA: The Nail the Kents do not discover the spacecraft because their truck's tire was punctured by a nail. Kal-El is found and adopted by an Amish family and does not become Superman until much later. In the Tangent Comics reality, Superman's origin is completely different as an ordinary man finds himself evolving into something millions of years beyond human. Superman: True Brit is a humorous re-imagining of Superman in which the ship crashes in England. In Superman: Secret Identity, a teenage boy named Clark Kent in the \\"real world\\", where Superman is nothing more than a comic book character, somehow develops super-human powers like those of his namesake. After a brief career as a mysterious, non-costumed \\"Superboy\\", Clark dons the fictional character's colors and continues to work in secret as \\"Superman\\". In other media Given Superman's cultural status as one of the most recognizable fictional characters ever created, he has been adapted into other forms numerous times. On first time outings, such as the premiere episode of a television series or a first feature film, the origin story is generally depicted. Radio His origin's first depiction outside of the source material was in the 1940 radio serial The Adventures of Superman. In this version, after being sent off in the rocket ship from Krypton, a kind of Counter Earth on the other side of the Sun, by his father while still an infant, Superman matures during the flight and emerges full-grown as an adult when he lands on Earth. He is greeted by a man and a boy who give him the idea of disguising himself as Clark Kent, after which he looks for a job at the Daily Planet. Among other concepts and characters, the radio program introduced kryptonite into the Superman mythology. These fragments of radioactive debris from Superman's home planet were created to allow actor Bud Collyer the occasional time off from recording, as Superman periodically succumbed to the baleful rays and be absent for some episodes. Kryptonite was incorporated into Superman's origin in the comics in Superman #61, published in 1949. Superman 1940s cartoons Fleischer Studios presented the origin in the first of the Superman animated cartoons. Titled simply \\"Superman\\", (also referred to as \\"The Mad Scientist\\"), the animated short begins with a brief prologue that introduces Krypton as an advanced civilization that had brought forth a race of supermen, whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. When giant quakes threaten to destroy Krypton forever, one of the planet's leading scientists places his infant son in a rocket bound for Earth. A passing motorist finds the uninjured child and takes it to the local orphanage. As the child grows to maturity, he discovers his powers and eventually takes the identity of Clark Kent. Jor-El is not mentioned by name in this first cartoon and Clark's adoptive parents are not mentioned at all. The Fleischer cartoons were responsible for Superman being able to fly. When they started work on the series, Superman could only leap from place to place. But they deemed it as \\"silly looking\\" after seeing it animated and decided to have him fly instead. Superman film serial The first chapter of the 1948 Superman film serial, titled \\"Superman Comes to Earth\\", depicts Superman's origin in detail. In this version, Krypton is a rugged planet that is home to an advanced civilization of super men and women. As Krypton experiences a series of natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions and tidal waves, Jor-El calls an emergency session of the governing council to warn them of the planet's impending fate. Jor-El explains that Krypton is being pulled into the sun, which will lead to the planet's destruction in short period of time and urges the council to sponsor the construction of a fleet of spacecraft to carry the population of Krypton to Earth. The council votes against Jor-El's proposal, even as the tremors shake their session and grow in frequency. Jor-El returns home where he and his wife Lara send their infant son Kal-El to Earth in a model spacecraft that was intended to test the proposed larger spacecraft. On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the spacecraft and pull him from it before it explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark has a responsibility to use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that the world needs him and that he must leave their farm and go where he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis. In later chapters, Clark applies for a job at the Daily Planet, and is hired after delivering a story on a mining accident from which Superman rescues Lois Lane. Adventures of Superman Adventures of Superman. The 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman explored Superman's origin in the first episode, titled \\"Superman on Earth\\". The destruction of Krypton and Clark's upbringing by the Kents are largely identical to the version presented in the 1948 film serial. In this version, Clark decides to move to Metropolis after Eben dies. He is hired by the Daily Planet after getting an exclusive interview with a man rescued by Superman in his first public appearance. Superman: The Movie Jor-El and baby Kal-El.The origin presented in Richard Donner's 1978 Superman film is considered to be the definitive origin story not only for Superman, but a template for origins stories in the super hero movie genre. The film keeps the classic components intact, but explores more of Clark's boyhood in Smallville. Much of the film's groundwork is laid during the film's first sequences on the planet Krypton, with actor Marlon Brando portraying Superman's Kryptonian father, Jor-El. In this film, Jonathan Kent dies but Martha survives to see her adopted son become Superman. Superman is divided into three basic sections, each with three distinct themes and visual styles. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of science fiction films, but also lays the groundwork for the Jesus Christ analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a Norman Rockwell painting. The third (and largest) segment was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called \\"verisimilitude\\"), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach.Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, DVD audio commentary, 2001, Warner Home Video Lois & Clark In the 1990s television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, more inspiration was taken from Byrne's work on Man of Steel. Feeling it was a more relatable version of the story, the show's producers and main developer also kept around Superman's adoptive parents as regular cast members, giving the main protagonist people to confide in. The series pilot begins with Clark's arrival in Metropolis. Clark and his mother develop his uniform in a musical montage set against Bonnie Tyler's single \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\". Superman makes his public debut saving a space station mission from sabotage by Lex Luthor, who is initially portrayed in his corporate tycoon incarnation. Clark's adoptive parents explain how they found him in a spacecraft in the second episode \\"Strange Visitor (From Another Planet)\\" and how they initially believed that he was part of an experiment when investigators ask them about debris from a Russian space station. Clark later learns that he is from Krypton after finding the spacecraft in the custody of the secret government agency Bureau 39. Clark questions why he was abandoned, but later learns of Krypton's destruction through a series of messages left for him by Jor-El in the episode \\"Foundling\\". The series explored more of the history and culture of Krypton in a story arc that spanned the final episodes of the third season and the first episodes of the fourth. Superman: The Animated Series Superman: The Animated Series premiered with a three-part episode titled \\"The Last Son of Krypton\\". The series creators felt that focusing on the alien civilization of Krypton in the premiere episode would help differentiate the series from their earlier work Batman: The Animated Series. They intended to mirror the structure of the origin presented in the 1978 film, but they felt that it would seem stale unless they added some new dimension to it. This version's major difference is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac is portrayed as the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he can avoid the council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons that the loss of the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, but his own survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their eyes as he works to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal- El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman. Smallville A slightly older Kal-El just out of his Kryptonian ship in the pilot episode of Smallville. The television series Smallville is a reimagining of the Superman mythology, starting from Clark Kent's teenage years. The series is named after Clark Kent's home town and focuses on the challenges he faces growing up in the rural midwest, while also discovering his super powers and the details of his alien origins. The series creators and cast have specified that the series is about Clark Kent and not Superman, and that the character will not appear in costume or fly in the series. However, by series end, at least one of these rules was broken.Smallville Season 10 Episode 21‚Äì22, \\"Finale\\" The series begins with the arrival of Kal-El's spacecraft in Smallville during a massive meteor shower that affects the rural town for years to come. Jonathan and Martha Kent find the child and adopt him with the help of Lionel Luthor. The Kents raise Clark and instruct him that he must not reveal his powers to anyone. Clark initially becomes friends with Lex Luthor, but Lex's obsession with learning Clark's secret drives them to become enemies. Clark is aware of his super-speed, super-strength and invulnerability in the series pilot. In subsequent episodes and seasons, he discovers other abilities, including X-ray vision, heat vision, super hearing and super breath. Clark has demonstrated his ability to fly while under Jor-El's control, but does not know how to use this ability at will. Details about the planet Krypton are revealed slowly over the course of the series. Clark learns of the planet and his alien origins from Dr. Virgil Swann. He later discovers that Jor-El had programmed his memory and will into the spacecraft that carried Clark to Earth. Through Jor-El, Clark learns that Zod's ambition to conquer Krypton led to the planet's destruction. Clark's journey is completed in the last episode of the series, when he dons the costume and becomes Superman to stop Apokolips from colliding with Earth. Superman Returns Director Bryan Singer felt that most people were familiar with Superman's origin and wanted to make Superman Returns as a semi-sequel to Richard Donner's Superman, with the two films sharing the same origin story. The movie opens with a very brief summary of the origin story that reads, \\"On the doomed planet Krypton, a wise scientist placed his infant son into a spacecraft and launched him to Earth. Raised by a kind farmer and his wife, the boy grew up to become our greatest protector...Superman\\". Otherwise, the film portrays only a few scenes related to Superman's origin. The destruction of Krypton is seen before the opening credits, Lex Luthor invades the Fortress of Solitude and views the recordings that Jor-El had sent to Earth with Kal-El, and Clark Kent discovers his ability to fly in a flashback. Superman Returns utilized footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and nearly identical set design for Kryptonian structures as the 1978 film. Subtle similarities were also purposefully created, such as modeling the \\"new\\" Kent farmhouse after the \\"old\\" one, and having Eva Marie Saint's Martha Kent drive the same make and color of pickup truck as driven by the Kents in the original film. Certain scenes in the Kent farm also showed pictures of Brandon Routh's Clark Kent inserted into photos with Glenn Ford's Jonathan Kent.Making Superman Returns: From Script to Screen on the Superman Returns DVDDesigning Superman: From Art and Costume Design to Set Construction on the Superman Returns DVDResurrecting Jor-El featurette on the Superman Returns DVD Man of Steel In 2010, Warner Bros announced that Christopher Nolan, who had previously directed Batman's origin story in Batman Begins, was to be the producer on a reboot of the Superman film franchise. Director Zack Snyder stated that the film was to focus on Superman's early days and not be based on any particular comic book. For the most part, the film keeps classic elements intact but explores Clark's life before becoming Superman. Much like previous versions, Jonathan dies but Martha survives to see her son become Superman. Man of Steel depicts Kal-El as Krypton's first naturally conceived child; most Kryptonians were artificially engineered newborns meant to fill predetermined roles in Krypton's society. Before sending Kal-El to Earth, Jor-El infuses Krypton's genetic Codex into Kal-El's cells in order to preserve Kryptonian civilization. As Kal-El arrives at Earth, he is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. When he reaches adulthood, Clark develops his abilities and becomes a nomad, saving people in secret. Later, Clark joins an investigation led by Lois Lane of a Kryptonian spaceship, where learns about his alien legacy. Lois, who had followed Clark into the ship, investigates Clark's life and decides to not to reveal his secret. Superman has his first major battle with General Zod, who wants to terraform Earth into a new Krypton. During their final battle, Superman is forced to kill Zod to prevent him from killing civilians. Clark later decides to become a reporter alongside Lois at the Daily Planet in order to continue his superhero activities.

Luigi Bressan, the Vatican pronuncio to Pakistan, visited the school on September 8, 1989. Maxwell Shanti, the school principal, spelled out the features of La Salle education, noting that more than any other results, La Salle was aiming at character formation. As of January 2012, the school had 5670 students, eight brothers, and 110 teachers (41 male and 69 female). The domestic staff comprised 22 men and 3 women.La Salle Website Founder Saint John Baptist de La Salle (born 3 December 1208 Rheims, France; died 15 April 1727 in Saint-Yon, Rouen) was a priest, educational reformer, and founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. He is a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, and the patron saint of teachers. 1679, what began as a charitable effort to help Adrian Nyel establish a school for the poor in De La Salle's home town gradually became his life's work. He thereby began a new order, the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, also known as the De La Salle Brothers (in the U.K., Ireland, Australia and Asia) or, most commonly in the United States, the Christian Brothers. They are sometimes confused with a different congregation of the same name founded by Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice in Ireland, who are known in the U.S. as the Irish Christian Brothers. Logo and motto The five-pointed radiant star is the worldwide logo of the Salle Brothers, \\"Signum Fidei\\". It symbolizes the spirit of faith. The school motto is \\"God, Truth, Charity\\".

It was previously known as Bacillus columnaris, Chondrococcus columnaris, Cytophaga columnaris and Flexibacter columnaris. The bacteria are ubiquitous in fresh water, and cultured fish reared in ponds or raceways are the primary concern ‚Äì with disease most prevalent in air temperatures above 12‚Äì14 ¬∞C. It is often mistaken for a fungal infection. The disease is highly contagious and the outcome is often fatal. It is not zoonotic. Causes The bacteria usually enter fish through gills, mouth, or small wounds, and is prevalent where high bioloads exist, or where conditions may be stressful due to overcrowding or low dissolved oxygen levels in the water column. The bacteria can persist in water for up to 32 days when the hardness is 50 ppm or more.Aukes, G. Fish disease articles: Columnaris disease. Retrieved 25 July 2007. Minerals are however essential for fish and often the reduction or removal of such minerals in treatment for Columnaris would affect fish mineral uptake and thus affect: oxygen utilization, osmotic regulation, metabolic processes, among may other biological processes and poor minerals (GH) may be a contributing cause to the advancement in severity of this disease, as deficits can increase vulnerability to opportunistic infections (citations). Symptoms An infection will usually first manifest in fish by causing frayed and ragged fins. This is followed by the appearance of ulcerations on the skin, and subsequent epidermal loss, identifiable as white or cloudy, fungus-like patches ‚Äì particularly on the gill filaments. Mucus often also accumulates on the gills, head and dorsal regions. Gills will change colour, either becoming light or dark brown, and may also manifest necrosis. Fish will breathe rapidly and laboriously as a sign of gill damage. Anorexia and lethargy are common, as are mortalities, especially in young fish. Diagnosis Bacteria can be isolated from gills, skin and the kidneys. For definitive diagnosis, the pathogen should then be cultured on reduced nutrient agar. Inhibiting contaminant growth on the agar by adding antibiotics and keeping the temperature at 37 ¬∞C should improve culture results. Colonies are small, 3‚Äì4 mm in diameter, and grow within 24 hours. They are characteristically rhizoid in structure and pale yellow in colour. Prognosis Ulcerations develop within 24 to 48 hours. Fatality occurs between 48 and 72 hours if no treatment is pursued; however, at higher temperatures death may occur within hours. Other symptoms may accompany the disease, including lethargy, color loss, redness around the infection site, loss of appetite and twitching or rubbing the body against objects.Fournier, Christie. \\"Cotton Wool Disease (Flexibacter Columnaris)\\". Nippyfish.net. March 2, 2011. Retrieved March 16, 2011. Treatment As Flavobacterium columnare is Gram-negative, fish can be treated with a combination of the antibiotics nitrofurazone and kanamycin administered together synergistically. A medicated fish bath (ideally using aquarium merbromin, alternately methylene blue, or potassium permanganate and salt), is generally a first step, as well lowering the aquarium temperature to 75 ¬∞F (24 ¬∞C) is a must, since columnaris is much more virulent at higher temperatures, especially 85‚Äì90 ¬∞F. Medicated food containing oxytetracycline is also an effective treatment for internal infections, but resistance is emerging. Potassium permanganate, copper sulfate, and hydrogen peroxide can also be applied externally to adult fish and fry, but can be toxic at high concentrations. Vaccines can also be given in the face of an outbreak or to prevent disease occurrence.

Born in Portland, New Brunswick, the son of William A. Chesley and Mary Ann Algee, Chesley received his education at the schools of St. John and at the Albert County Grammar School. He then worked on a farm for a time, after which he learned the engineering and machinist business. He subsequently engaged in business for himself and was the proprietor of an extensive foundry. In 1881, he was appointed census commissioner for the Saint John County and was also one of the Dominion Liquor License Commissioners. He was first elected to the Council Board of the city of Portland in 1876, remaining until 1885. During that time, he was elected to the Council of the Municipality of the City and County of St. John. He was mayor of Portland in 1885 and 1886, and elected by acclamation, to the same office, in 1888. During that time, an act was passed by the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for the purpose of appointing three commissioners to prepare a scheme to unite Portland with the city of St. John. Chesley was appointed to represent the city of Portland on this commission. A vote was taken in the Spring of 1889, and the scheme of union, submitted to the people, was carried by a large majority, Portland and St. John becoming one corporation. Chesley again became alderman, and continued so until 1894, when he retired. He was warden of the County in 1891 and 1892, and at the by-election of 1892 for the riding of City and County of St. John, on the retirement of the current MP Charles Nelson Skinner, who was appointed to the office of Judge of Probate, he was acclaimed to the House of Commons of Canada. A Conservative, he was defeated in the 1896 election. Chesley was married twice: first, in December 1860, to Mary F. Small; and again, in 1872, to Annie May. He had eight children. He was an Episcopalian. He died in Montreal on December 28, 1922.

It was the first League Cup Final to be played at the new Wembley Stadium, and the first to be played in England since the old Wembley was demolished in 2000. The defending champions were Chelsea, who beat Arsenal in the 2007 Final at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. The final was contested by Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Arsenal 6‚Äì2 on aggregate in the semi-final, and Chelsea, who beat Everton 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. Tottenham Hotspur defeated Chelsea 2‚Äì1, after extra time, winning their first trophy in nine years. Chelsea took the lead in the 39th minute through a Didier Drogba free kick. This goal made Drogba the first player to score in three League Cup Finals, having also done so in 2005 and 2007. A Wayne Bridge handball gave Tottenham a 68th-minute penalty, and Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov converted from the spot. Three minutes into extra time, Jonathan Woodgate headed a Jermaine Jenas free kick onto Petr ƒåech, who in turn pushed it straight back onto Woodgate's head to score the winning goal. The win was an important one for Tottenham as they secured UEFA Cup qualification for the following season, something they would not have achieved in the Premier League, as they finished 11th. For Chelsea, it was the second of four competitions in which they would finish as runners-up that season, after they lost to Manchester United in the Community Shield and ended up finishing as runners-up to the same team in the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League.

In July 2004, EADS Astrium SAS signed a contract for delivery of THEOS with GISTDA (Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency) of Bangkok, Thailand. GISTDA is Thailand's leading national organization (i.e., space agency) in the field of space activities and applications. The Thai Ministry of Science and Technology funds the program. THEOS was launched from Dombarovskiy at 06:37 GMT on 1 October 2008, by a Dnepr rocket. The satellite was initially planned for a 2007 launch using the space vehicle Rokot of Eurockot Launch Services . The contract was however canceled when Eurockot faced a parts shortage. On 24 March 2014, THEOS captured images showing some 300 objects in close proximity to the suspected crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, in the Indian Ocean. The discovery was reported by GISTDA on 27 March 2014. The objects have not yet been identified as debris.  Benefits  THEOS was used to observe natural resources in the country by gathering information to be used by both the government and public for research and mapping. THEOS observation missions are conducted to observe agriculture sites, the production of agricultural crops, forest demolition, forest types, shrimp farms, water pollution from oil leaks, water sources, community areas, illegal farms, disaster areas, and the satellite can also be used for city planning. THEOS also reduces the cost of purchasing satellite images from other countries. Moreover, the information that is gathered from the satellite can also be sold to other countries. Thailand has also gained knowledge and technology for designing and building satellite from the French. In addition, specialists from France also travel to Thailand to teach Thai personnel every year.  Overview  THEOS was designed to be a small sized satellite with a mass of 750 kg (include equipment and fuel). It has a hexagonal shape with a height of 2.4 meters and a width of 2 meters (when the solar panel folds). It was launched into low earth orbit in 2008 to an altitude of 822 km and with an inclination of 98 degrees. It is equipped with optical imagery which can observe in the visible band to near infrared. Its mission duration is expected to be at least 5 years.

The long railway began in Calalzo and ended in Toblach. Its gauge was 950 mm ‚Äî \\"Italian metre gauge\\". The Cortina d'Ampezzo - Toblach part was closed in 1962 and the Cortina d'Ampezzo - Calalzo di Cadore in 1964. Two EMUs went to the Trento - Mal√® railway and are still in use. Other vehicles went to the Apulo-Lucane railway. Construction The line was begun in 1916 to supply the military needs of the White War, when Italy attempted to annex the Austrian province of South Tyrol, as both sides sought to sustain their troop operations among the peaks of the Dolomite range. On the Italian side a steam-operated 750mm narrow gauge line was extended northwards from Calalzo towards Cortina, while in the north the Austrians built a 700mm gauge feldbahn track southwards (with motive power from small petrol locomotives) from a military supply depot at H√∂hlenstein.

The Italian government then completed the line using money provided as reparation by the Austrian side, where possible using the route of the respective military railways.

It was shot in Belle Glade, Clewiston, and Okeelanta, Florida as well as Jamaica and includes cane fields and worker camps (Ritta Village, Prewitt Village) owned by US Sugar Corporation and the Okeelanta Corporation. The cane harvesters were brought in to perform the autumn harvest of sugar cane under the H-2A Visa program. The Jamaicans replaced earlier generations of Bahamian seasonal workers who in turn replaced migrant labor recruited from the Cotton Belt (region) in the first half of the 20th century. A documentary short that accompanies the DVD version of the film states that human labor was abandoned for mechanical harvesters in 1992. The film features interviews with a United States Department of Labor official, a Florida Sugar Cane League official, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, local merchants, and a dozen or so field workers.

It is a fairly small bunting, 14 to 15 cm in length. The tail is fairly short with little or no white on the outer feathers. Breeding males have bright chestnut- brown upperparts and head. The breast and belly are yellow with streaks on the sides. Non-breeding males are similar but duller with the chestnut partly hidden by pale fringes to the feathers. The female is mostly dull brown with dark streaks above while the underparts are mainly pale yellow. The rump is dull chestnut and the throat is buff. The variable, high-pitched song is given from a perch low in a tree. The call is a short zick, similar to the call of the little bunting. It breeds in Siberia, northern Mongolia and north-eastern China. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in southern China, south-east Asia and north-east India. There are a number of records from Europe but some of these are considered to be escapes from captivity rather than genuine vagrants. During the breeding season it inhabits open forest with plenty of ground cover and shrubs. Wintering and migrating birds occur in farmland, scrub and woodland edges.

James Wade followed up his success at the 2007 World Matchplay by adding this title to his collection. He beat World Champion Raymond van Barneveld in the semi-final and Terry Jenkins in the final. Jenkins suffered his fifth televised final defeat in twelve months as his search for his first major title continued. The top 24 players in the PDC Order of Merit qualified automatically. There were four further qualifiers from the PDPA Players Championship Order of Merit (the best performers from up to 20 non-televised events during the year) and there were four PDPA Irish qualifiers. The All- Ireland qualifiers were held on September 16. As in previous years, the format of the tournament features much shorter first round matches (best of three sets) and players must start each leg on a double, as well as finish on a double.

His death was ruled a suicide by five official investigations, but remains a subject of conspiracy theories. Suicide and investigation Park Police discovered Foster, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gun shot wound to the head, in Fort Marcy Park off the George Washington Parkway in Virginia, on July 20, 1993. Foster was holding a gun in his hand. An autopsy and subsequent investigation later confirmed that Foster had committed suicide by shooting himself once in the mouth with the .38 caliber Colt revolver found at the scene. Subsequent investigations found that Foster was distraught over accusations and criticisms related to the White House Travel Office controversy. Foster had confided to friends and colleagues that he was considering resignation, but feared that he could not handle the \\"personal humiliation\\" of returning to Arkansas in defeat. Foster admitted to his sister that he was depressed shortly before his death, and he sought treatment for depression one day before committing suicide. Although police found no evidence of foul play, several tabloids and newsletters speculated that Foster's death may have been a homicide, possibly involving the Clintons themselves. Subsequent investigations by special prosecutor Robert Fiske and the Senate Banking Committee concluded that there was no evidence of a homicide. A final investigation, led by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, also concluded that there was no evidence to support the claim that Foster was murdered. Starr's report addressed several additional questions about physical and forensic evidence that had previously fueled speculation about the case. The report established that Foster owned the handgun used in the suicide, and confirmed that the body had not been moved from its position prior to its discovery by police. The report concluded \\"In sum, based on all of the available evidence, which is considerable, the OIC [Office of Independent Counsel] agrees with the conclusion reached by every official entity that has examined the issue: Mr. Foster committed suicide by gunshot in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993.\\" The suicide has nevertheless continued to fuel speculation: then-presidential candidate Donald Trump made news in 2016 when he remarked in an interview with the Washington Post that Foster's death was \\"very fishy\\", and added \\"I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don't do that because I don't think it's fair.\\" Evidence Torn note A draft of a resignation letter, was found torn into 27 pieces in a briefcase after his death. Associate White House counsel, Steve Neuwirth, discovered the torn pieces of the note in Foster's briefcase on July 26. After receiving the note from Neuwirth, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum handled the note various times before giving it to Park Police Lieutenant Joseph Megby the following evening. The United States Department of Justice revealed the note's contents at a joint press conference with the Park Police on August 10. The DoJ stated that a smudged palm print was on the note, but no fingerprints; they confirmed the handwriting as Foster's. Independent Counsel Robert Ray's report regarding the Whitewater controversy stated the FBI Laboratory performed a 1995 fingerprint examination of the note and identified Nussbaum's palm print on it. The report stated that three separate handwriting analyses of the note by the Capitol Police and the FBI determined that the handwriting on the note was Foster's. Three independent handwriting experts, however, concluded that the note was a forgery, with Oxford University manuscript expert Reginald Alton stating that the forgery was done by a \\"moderate forger, not necessarily a pro, somebody who could forge a check.\\" Conspiracy theories The Arkansas Project On May 2, 1999, The Washington Post published new details on the pursuit of a Foster conspiracy in an article by David Brock, a key figure in the Troopergate and Whitewater scandals whose disillusionment with the political corruption motivating what would come to be known as the Arkansas Project ended his lifelong commitment to the Conservative movement and facilitated public dissemination of insider details on G.O.P. machinations. The article explains how Brock was \\"summoned\\" to a meeting with Rex Armistead in Miami, Florida at an airport hotel. Brock claims that Armistead laid out for him an elaborate \\"Vince Foster murder scenario\\" ‚Äì a scenario that he found implausible. The Clinton Chronicles: A Political Firestorm In 1997 crime reporter Dan Moldea was approached by Regnery Publishing House, a conservative group whose leadership was impressed by Moldea's published works, to publish a book on the Foster case.Lori Leibovich, \\"Why Vincent Foster can't rest in peace\\" , Salon.com, May 28, 1998. In researching Foster's death, Moldea found that documents relating to the Whitewater corporation were removed from Foster's office on July 22 and sent to the Clinton's personal attorney, and that the most oft-used conspiracy scenario could be traced back to Park Police Major Robert Hines, who shared the idea with Reed Irvine (Accuracy in Media) and Christopher Ruddy (New York Post). Moldea concludes, and Maj. Hines publicly maintains, that Hines incorrectly told Irvine and Ruddy \\"... that there is no exit wound in Foster's head ... I don't think there was anything nefarious here; he was being approached by reporters and he wanted something to say.\\" Still, the \\"missing exit wound\\" claim continued to surface. Moldea's research sought, among other things, to discover the origins of this line of investigation into the Clintons' credibility. In an interview for Salon.com, he suggests that \\"Foster had some blond hair and carpet fibers on his suit jacket, and he had semen in his underwear. So, the Jerry Falwells and the right-wing crowd get a hold of this information, and‚Ä¶they start making movies alleging that the Clintons were involved in this murder.\\" In 1994, Falwell subsidized the creation of a film called The Clinton Chronicles that featured Ruddy's claims that the gun that killed Foster was placed in his hand after the fact, and that Foster's body was laid out to give the appearance of suicide, among others. Funding for the film was provided by Citizens for Honest Government, an organization to which Falwell gave $200,000 in 1994 and 1995.Murray WaasThe Falwell connection, Salon.com, March 11, 1998. Citizens for Honest Government covertly paid individuals who had provided information to media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the American Spectator magazine;\\" and in 1995, made discretionary payments to two Arkansas state troopers who had spoken out in support of the idea of a conspiracy surrounding Foster's death. The two troopers, Roger Perry and Larry Patterson, had also previously given testimony supporting Paula Jones' claims of sexual misconduct and misuse of government resources against Bill Clinton (see Troopergate).

Teaching at Moscow University * Developed and taught courses on \\"Electron-optic equipment\\", \\"Interaction of ions with the surface\\". Headed the Soviet (and later Russian) seminar on fundamental and applied problems in the interaction of ions with the surface ‚Äì a special seminar for PhD students studying sputtering and ion emissions. * Supervised 30 successful PhD students, eight of whom went on to become Doctors of Science. Scientific work * Was the first to observe the anisotropy of single-crystal sputtering at high energies of incident ions (in the range from one to tens of keV) and the anisotropy of ion scattering. * Discovered a quantum effect in sputtering, showing that spin orientation influences the emission of secondary particles from ferromagnetic materials. * Discovered oscillations in the energy spectrum of secondary excited ions, which point to quantum interference of various states of the ions and the target. This provided a new experimental method of establishing the electronic structure of the surface. * Through experiments and computer simulation, was the first to research the specifics of binary-compound single crystal sputtering and find different anisotropy of the emission of the different components of the compound or alloy. * Studied radiation stability of a number of compounds, used as hard coatings and as sources of light of increased brightness. * Developed the methodology and created the first industrial installation for etching surface structure by ion bombardment. These and her other scientific results are highly valued in scientific papers and books. See, for example, N.V. Pleshivdtsev ‚ÄúCathodic Sputtering‚Äù (Atomizdat 1963) and R.

Under the Yuan Dynasty, it is replaced by the title of Zhangguan and there was one for each administrative subdivision , where he combined the functions of governor and chief of the armies. This title was also given to a person at the head of a central government office. This charge usually fell to a Mongol, probably to a Semu, thus guaranteeing the preservation of power within the Mongols. Some other populations, however, could have an administrative title with close functions. Under the Golden Horde, there was also an official named The texts of Yanghe, in the Uighur dialect of Tourfan say that he should be paid a large sum of gold and silver when the Darugha Turfan was replaced.Abdurishid Yakup, The Turfan Dialect of Uyghur, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005 p. 300 The Turkic term basqaq does not appear in Mongolian sources. In Russian sources, the darughachi were almost always referred to as baskak (plural baskaki).See for example the reference to one under the year 1269 in A. N.

Kolbas-The Mongols in Iran: Chingiz Khan to Uljaytu, 1220‚Äì1309, p.156 The Mongol Empire attempted to send darughachi to Goryeo of Korea in 1231, after the first (of six) invasions. According to some records, 72 darughachi were sent and Mongol military garrisons withdrawn. However, repeated rebellions and continued Goryeo resistance to Mongol dominion (the original darughachi that were stationed were all killed by Goryeo forces in the summer of 1232) made the stationing of darughachi difficult.\\"Henthorn, W. E., Korea: The Mongol Invasions, p. 71. Leiden, the Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 1963.\\" While there are questions regarding the actual number of darughachi stationed (the extant record denoting 72 darughachi was itself a derivation of an older record that has been lost; Goryeo was too small a territory to merit so many darughachi; the names of none of the 72 darughachi remain, which is unusual considering the importance of their position), most reliable sources (including the Goryeo-sa) indicate that at least some darughachi were stationed in Goryeo for the duration of its vassaldom to the Mongol Empire. \\"Henthorn, W. E., Korea: The Mongol Invasions, p. 72. Leiden, the Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 1963.\\" While further mention of the darughachi in Korea is scarce in extant sources, after peace was secured between Goryeo and the Mongol Empire in 1259 establishing Korea as a vassal to the Empire, the stationing of darughachi in Korea was likely a more stable proposition.

Famous for its Meistersaal recording hall and situated approximately 150 metres from the former Berlin Wall, it used to be known as \\"Hansa Studio by the Wall\\", or \\"Hansa by the Wall\\". The Meistersaal known as \\"The Big Hall by the Wall\\" has been fully restored and is now used for concerts and other events as well as recording. History The Hansa Records label was founded in 1962 (one year after the building of the Berlin Wall) by brothers Peter and Thomas Meisel in the Wilmersdorf quarter of West Berlin. From 1965 they temporarily rented the Ariola production facilities in the Meistersaal location, but also built up their own Studio I on Nestorstra√üe in the Halensee neighbourhood, which opened in 1973. Nevertheless, Hansa had to abandon its own production facilities the next year, and from 1974 again rented the Meistersaal location on K√∂thener Stra√üe (now called Studio II). Meanwhile, the Meistersaal, noted for its outstanding acoustics, was used not only for light music productions but also for classical music recordings. In the early and mid-1980s, all productions were overseen by English record producer Michael Blakey. The studios played host to many well-known acts, including Tangerine Dream, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop, U2,Susan Fast, \\"Music, Contexts, and Meaning in U2,\\" in p. 45 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Claw Boys Claw, Depeche Mode, Marillion, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Killing Joke, Boney M. and most recently Manic Street Preachers, R.E.M., Snow Patrol, Kent, Living Things and Go Go Berlin. The roll of notable recordings and the acoustic quality, especially that of the Meistersaal, have given the studio near legendary status, especially within the post-punk and synthpop genres. In 2018, the studio was the subject of a documentary feature by filmmaker Mike Christie titled 'Hansa Studios: By The Wall 1976-90' which aired across Europe on Sky Arts and Sky Arte.

The underparts are mostly white except for a glossy bluish black breast band, a black chin spot and black thighs and grey axillaries. The tail is black with the feathers having white tips and white edges on the outer tail feathers. The sexes are similar except that males have yellow eyes and females have been reported sometimes to have orangey-red eyes. Juveniles are similar to adults but the plumage has a more rufous cast. The Rwenzori batis measures 11‚Äì12 cm in length, and it weighs 8‚Äì15.5 g. Voice The territorial call is a slow low-pitched whistle, which has been described as both ventriloqual and eerie. It is repeated with an interval of 2‚Äì4 seconds between each whistle. Distribution and habitat The Rwenzori batis occurs in the Albertine Rift from the Rwenzori Mountains in the north to Mount Kabobo in the south. It was also recorded in western Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. It inhabits montane evergreen forest at altitudes of , foremost in dense African alpine bamboo forest or otherwise closed canopy forest on ridges. It also occurs in mixed forest and scrub. In 2004, it was recorded in Virunga National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and Volcanoes National Park. Behaviour and ecology The breeding biology and habits of the Rwenzori batis are little known. It is a shy, active bird which is constantly moving but tends to keep hidden in the foliage. It normally forages in mid levels in undergrowth at 2-6m above the ground but also in lower canopy of tall trees. It is insectivorous, flycatching using short flights but most food is probably gleaned from the foliage and twigs. The male appears to regularly feed the incubating or brooding females; the nest and its contents have never been formally described. Taxonomy The Rwenzori batis belongs to the family Platysteiridae, which also contains Margaret's batis, the Cape batis, Forest batis, dark batis and Woodward's batis. The Rwenzori batis appears to replace the Ituri batis at higher altitudes.

Woodward's batis prefers lowland and evergreen forest as well as dense acacia woodland, sand forest, riparian forest and miombo woodland. In Malawi its range extends up to . Behaviour Woodward's batis actively and continuously forages throughout the day, capturing insect prey by gleaning it from twigs, leaves and branches, typically while hovering in mid-air. The nest is the typical batis loosely- constructed shallow cup, made out of rootlets, tendrils, fragments of dead leaves and sometimes lichen, bound together with strands of spider web. Unusually for this genus it is usually placed amongst creepers or leaves and rarely in a tree fork. The 1-3 eggs are laid from October‚ÄìNovember and these are probably incubated solely by the female, as in most other batises..

In June 2018, the ministry was renamed the Ministry of Indigenous Affairs. The mandate of the ministry is to: *promote collaboration and coordination across ministries on Aboriginal policy and programs; *set priorities for and track the progress of Ontario's Aboriginal agenda; *enhance government's awareness of Aboriginal people, issues and best practices for consulting and engaging with Aboriginal people; *work with the federal government to find ways to make the most of federal funding; *help Aboriginal people to access Ontario government programs, services and information; *reform the land claims process to help address historical grievances; and *encourage diversity, especially representation of Aboriginal people, in the Ontario Public Service. The ministry has four key priorities: *Stronger Indigenous Relationships; *Improved Social Conditions; *Economic Opportunity and Sustainability; and *Enhanced Land Claim Settlements and Reconciliation. Land Claims One of the most divisive issues with the public has been land claims. MIA has been mandated to reform the land claim process and current land claims tend to be negotiated with the Native Reserves, with the public excluded, and proposed settlements are then presented to the public for their acceptance. Currently there is no independent body that represents the public in native land claims. Public concerns and evidence may have been ignored when it differed from proposed settlements but the public is expected to go along with negotiated settlement agreements.

Description The Ituri batis is a very small black and white bird, like a small shrike or old world flycatcher which is white below with a broad black breast band, a black head with a conspicuous white loral spot in front of a bright yellow eye. Black on the back and wings with a white strip on the wings and white outer tail feathers on an otherwise black tail. The females is similar to the male but has a thin white supercilium. Young birds are buffer above and greyer below. The Ituri batis has a body length of 9¬∑5‚Äì10 cm. Distribution and habitat The Ituri batis occurs in the eastern Congo Basin in Ituri and Itombwe in the north eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where it is uncommon and in the Budongo Forest in western Uganda where it is common. The Ituri batis is found in lowland forest, between 900m and 1300m. It prefers degraded forest such as secondary forest, and cultivated areas with scattered tall trees, such as plantations, and avoiding primary rainforest. Habits Little known but expected to be territorial and rather solitary like other batises, although groups of six birds have been recorded. A restless and active bird which forages high within the canopies of trees. The breeding biology is unknown except that, males have been recorded as feeding the female in March in Uganda, nestlings have been recorded in June and there is indirect evidence of breeding from February to August.

The house is located at the southwest corner of Gould and Church streets. It was designed by architect William Thomas as his own residence and office and completed in 1848. Today it is the middle of and owned by Ryerson University. The upper level consists of a cafe used by students and faculty, while the lower level is home to a student pub. The building is also used by the university to hold events and receptions. The house has a predominantly Gothic Revival architectural style. Thomas' office was located in a wing on Gould Street; however, it was later replaced by an addition to the residential part of the building. Murals in the front hall depicted rural scenes. Architecture Oakham house was constructed with yellow brick masonry on a stone foundation and topped with a slate roof. Pinnacles ornament the roofline, with two on each side of Oakham House's two front gables. The house exhibits many other Gothic elements such as the various carved-stone head sculptures on its facade. The carved-stone heads with garlands on their brows can also be seen at the base of the pinnacles. There are ten stone heads on the facade of the house. The entrance on Church Street consists of a pointed arch by multiple mouldings. This entrance is framed with engaged columns with figured capitals. A square with an ornate T is present on top of the front door and below the centre window. It has small shields on either side with heraldic devices and a coat of arms. The name of the building, \\"Oakham House\\", was carved in stone, and this sign was mounted above the front door. Two iron dogs facing each other, with iron rings in their mouths for hitching horses used to be present at the curb of the house. They were painted red in order to represent Chesapeake Bay Retrievers. Later on, the dogs were removed from the curb and mounted on the front entrance near the steps and were repainted black. The \\"Oakham House\\" sign along with the iron dogs have now been removed. Over the years, the house has gone through some major transformations mainly on the interior as it has been utilized by different individuals and organizations. Shortly before Thomas died in 1860, he sold the house to John McGee. Along with his family, McGee lived in the house until he sold it to the city in 1892. In 1899, it became the \\"Home for Working Boys\\". An addition was completed in 1900. In 1958, the house was sold to the Ontario Government and was given to the Ryerson Institute of Technology (now Ryerson University). It was then used as a student residence but is now used by Ryerson University for student amenities such as dining and for receptions and events at the institution.

It is found in south western central Africa. Taxonomy Margaret's batis was described by the American zoologist Wolfrid Rudyerd Boulton in 1934. The binomial and common names honour the American historian and novelist Margaret Leech (1893-1974). Two subspecies are recognised: *B. m. margaritae Boulton, 1934 ‚Äì Mount Moco in western Angola. *B. m. kathleenae White, C.M.N. 1941 ‚Äì southern Democratic Republic of Congo in southern Katanga and north western Zambia; possibly also in the extreme east of Angola, in eastern Moxico. Description Margaret's batis is a small, mainly black and white shrike-like bird with a black face mask and reddish eye, in a mainly dark grey head. They have white underparts with a broad black breast band in both sexes, with black wings which are marked in the male with a white wing stripe while the female has a rufous wing stripe. The tail is black with white outer tail feathers. Juveniles resemble the females but are duller and have brown eye. The bill and legs are black. They measure in length and weigh . Voice Margaret's batis is known to make various whistles and churring calls. The territorial call is a repeated, soft, thin \\"hoo-hoo-hoo-hooit-hooit-hooit\\" which varies in length. The female and male duet with a tweeting call. Distribution and habitat Margaret's batis occurs mostly in forests dominated by Cryptosepalum spp but also occurs in other types of dry evergreen forest, riverine forest and secondary scrub growth. It is usually found in pairs and it is thought that its social behaviour is similar to that of other batises. It forages in trees and is not as restless as many of its congeners when foraging, often staying still for up to a minute. It joins mixed foraging flocks, often in the company of chinspot batises. In Zambia there appear to be local movements out of Cryptosepalum forest during the November to April rainy season. Behaviour The breeding biology of Margaret's batis is little known. A nest was observed on Mount Moco, Angola, in 2010 when a single nest containing two eggs was found in the fork of a tall sapling in an area of dense undergrowth at an altitude of was attended by a pair of Margaret's batis. The nest was placed at a height of around from the ground, The inside of the nest cup was lined with very thin strips of grass, while the outside consisted of fine grass and mosses bound with spider's web, with small pieces of lichen attached to the spiders webs. The construction and dimensions of the nest are very similar to those of other batises.

It occurs in the humid forests of western Central Africa. Description The adult male has a velvety black head with a white loral spot and narrow supercilium, the head colour fades to blackish- grey on the hindcrown and is separated from the back by a white collar. The mantle and back are velvety-black with a mottled rump which has long, fluffy feathers. The wings are very black with a contrasting white wingstripe. The tail is black with white outer tail feathers. The underparts are white except for a glossy black breast band. The bill and legs are black and the eyes are golden yellow. The females is similar to the male but has a smaller loral spot and supercilium and has a narrower dark grey breast band. They are small birds measuring 9‚Äì10 cm in length and weighing 8‚Äì12g. Voice The song is a series of high, evenly pitched thin short notes \\"pee-pee-pee-pee\\" which resembles a squeaky bicycle pump. Distribution and habitat This species is very similar to the West African batis Batis occulta and this somewhat masks its true distribution but the Gabon batis has been found in Gabon, the Monte Alen National Park in Equatorial Guinea, the lowland Dja area in southern Cameroon and it has recently been discovered in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park in the extreme south of the Central African Republic. The Gabon batis is found in lowland forest, normally lower than 800m. It avoids primary rainforest, other than at the forest edge, and prefers secondary forest with a dense but broken canopy and thick, low undergrowth, as well as overgrown cacao and coffee plantations. It avoids cultivated land and the vicinity of villages and other man-made habitats. Habits The habits of the Gabon batis are similar to those of other batises and it is territorial and usually seen either singly, in pairs or in small family groups. It is a restless but unobtrusive bird and patrols the whole of its 18-20 ha territory each day, the male taking the lead and singing his song, especially in the morning and late afternoon. This species and the West African batis regularly have hostile interactions which the Gabon batis reacts to by raising its crown feathers and flicking its wings and tail while moving from sided to side. In the hottest part of the day the Gabon batis has been known to sunbathe. The Gabon batis is an arboreal forager, preferring to find food above heights of 5m from the ground. It is attracted by flowering trees and prefers to forage in small leafed trees. Prey is gleaned from leaves by hovering beside the tree, or in flight or is disturbed by the moving bird and swooped on. The favoured prey is various insects between 5mm and 15mm in length. The breeding biology of the Gabon batis is little known but young have been observed during the rainy season following the short dry season, September and February in Gabon, and the young stay with their parents for an extended period. Solitary, probably dispersing immatures were seen in the long dry season in July and August. Conservation status The Gabon batis is suspected to be experiencing a reduction in range and population as a result of forest clearance and degradation, however the rate of the suspected decline has not been estimated. Name The alternative common name and Latin binomial commemorates the French naturalist Jules Verreaux.

It forms a superspecies with other rather similar members of the genus Batis. Description The chinspot batis is a rather stout bird in length. It has a black mask on its face, with a short white eyestripe, a grey cap and a white throat. The upperparts are grey with a prominent white wingstripe. The eyes are yellow while the legs and bill are black. The underparts are white with a black breast band in the males, the female has a chestnut breast band and a chestnut spot on the throat. Young birds are similar to females but the breast band and spot on the throat are tawny. Distribution It is found in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Male Habits The chinspot batis is not normally sociable and is usually encountered singly or in pairs. It is a very active bird, moving its head in a constant search for prey, while it flicks its tail and wings, jerks its body and cocks its head. In the austral winter and early spring often forms \\"parliaments\\", which are congregations of up to ten birds, often consisting of birds of one sex. The birds in these parliaments display by flicking their wings to make a noise known as \\"wing-fripping\\" and call at each other and very often actually engage in fights between birds. Chinspot batises are territorial throughout the year, defending an area of around which the male advertises with a descending three note whistle from a prominent perch, the female may join the mail in a duet. This call is made in a head up posture, exposing the conspicuous white throat. In higher intensity territorial displays the male flies around in short circular flights above the canopy in a jerking, jinky flight with his rump fluffed out, his head held up and making frog like calls, whistling and fripping his wings. They are aggressive towards potential predators, especially owls and Laniarius bush-shrikes. Prey is most often foraged for in trees, either by hawking or by gleaning from foliage, most food is caught within the canopy. Sometimes hawks in the air like a flycatcher and very rarely catches prey on the ground. The prey is caught with an audible snap of the bill and then held down with one foot and stripped, larger prey items may be beaten against a branch. Arthropods but especially insects and insect larvae make up the largest part of their diet but spiders are included too. Breeding Female incubating The nest of the chinspot batis nest is a small cup constructed from plant fibres and spider webs and decorated with lichen. It is built by both sexes on a horizontal branch. The female lays one to four eggs which she incubates for 16‚Äì18 days, both adults feed the young. In a study of the breeding biology of chinspot batis conducted in Swaziland it was found that the nests were mainly constructed in bushes or trees protected by thorns. The eggs were laid between late September and early January, in the austral spring, with a notable peak in laying in November. The chinspot batis studied had a fledging rate of 0.65 fledglings per pair per annum. Pairs were normally single brooded unless breeding failed or fledged chicks disappeared. A replacement nest is normally built where a previous nest had failed. The adults were observed to prey mainly on caterpillars and moths and this was confirmed by observations at the nest as the young were fed predominantly with moths and caterpillars. The study also found that the rate at which nestlings were fed was dependent on their age, the older chicks receiving food more often than younger ones. In contrast to nestlings, younger fledglings were fed at a higher rate than older ones. Habitat Savanna woodland, mainly deciduous, including miombo, i.e. Brachystegia woodland, riverine thickets, bushveld and scrub. It can also be found in cultivated habitats such as orchards, farmland, gardens and parks. In the central African mountains it reaches . Its habitat specificity is greater in the northern parts of its range where there is more competition from other batises. Taxonomy The chinspot batis forms a superspecies with other species of woodland and forest batises, in southern Africa the representatives of this superspecies are the pririt batis, Woodward's batis, pale batis and Cape batis. Woodwards and Cape batises replace the chinspot batis in forest while the pririt batis and pale batis replace it geographically in arid woodlands to the west (pririt) and humid coastal woodlands to the east (pale). There are currently four recognised subspecies of chinspot batis. *B. m. pintoi Lawson, 1966 : Range: South-eastern Gabon to Angola, south-western Zaire and north- western Zambia *B. m. puella Reichenow, 1893 : Range: Eastern Zaire to Uganda, western Kenya and western Tanzania *B. m. palliditergum Clancey, 1955 : Range: Southern Zaire to Namibia, Botswana, Malawi and north-western South Africa *B. m. molitor (K√ºster, 1836) : Range: Southern Mozambique to eastern South Africa References External links * Chinspot batis - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds. * Chinspot Batis (Batis molitor) recordings at Xenocanto https://web.archive.org/web/20161019034227/http://test.xeno- canto.org/species/Batis-molitor chinspot batis Category:Birds of Sub-Saharan Africa chinspot batis Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Chinspot batis"},{"id":"12439688","text":"Strange Charm is the eighth solo studio album by English musician Gary Numan, originally released in November 1986, it was Numan's third release on his self-owned Numa Records label.

However, the album's stand-out tracks, \\"My Breathing\\" and \\"New Thing from London Town\\", were produced by Ade Orange and Bill Sharpe and Nick Smith, respectively, and offer a departure from the industrial sound of the rest of the album into quite different atmospheres. \\"New Thing from London Town\\" was a re-recorded version of the single released by Numan and Bill Sharpe (under the name Sharpe + Numan) a month before the release of Strange Charm. The Strange Charm version of the song retains the original music, but features new lyrics written and sung by Numan (the lyrics on the single version were written by Roger Odell). Elsewhere, the songs on Strange Charm range from radio-friendly pop (\\"The Sleeproom\\", \\"I Can't Stop\\") to slow-burning ballads \\"This is Love\\"), to fast-paced, energetic synth-rock (the title-track). By the time of Strange Charm's recording, Numan had found himself more and more alienated from the mainstream of British pop music, while most of the money he had made during the early part of his career had now been consumed by his costly self-funded record label. Numan later recollected that the studio atmosphere was tense: Not only did Numan find it very difficult to create the kind of sound that he wanted for Strange Charm, but the protracted recording sessions resulted in the album being recorded in its entirety twice, diluting Numan's enthusiasm for the finished product. Strange Charm was finally released in late 1986, many months after singles from the album had been released. \\"This Is Love\\" was released in April and peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart; \\"I Can't Stop\\" was released in June and reached No. 27, and the original version of \\"New Thing from London Town\\" was released in October and reached No. 52. No singles were taken from Strange Charm after the album's release in November. The only single Numan released that month was \\"I Still Remember\\", a remake of a song from Numan's 1985 album The Fury. Released as a charity single for the RSPCA, \\"I Still Remember\\" reached No. 74 on the UK Singles Chart. The Strange Charm album itself peaked at No. 59 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent only two weeks in the Top 75. For the visual look of Strange Charm, Numan abandoned the white suit-clad persona of The Fury and instead dyed his hair blond (again) and wore a Blade Runner-esque long leather jacket and sunglasses. Blade Runner was also the influence for one the B-sides of the album, \\"Time to Die\\", which takes its title and most of its lyrical content from Roy Batty's dying speech during the climax scene of the film. Strange Charm is the third of five Numan albums to feature saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who performed on the Blade Runner film score. Vocal samples from the film can be heard on Numan's albums The Fury (1985) and Outland (1991). Numan has referred to Blade Runner as \\"one of my all-time favourite films.\\"Praying to the Aliens: An Autobiography by Gary Numan with Steve Malins. (1997, Andr√© Deutsch Limited), p.210 Numan did not support Strange Charm with a live tour (making it his first studio album since 1981's Dance not to be supported by a concert tour). However, Numan embarked on the 18-date \\"Exhibition Tour\\" in September 1987 to promote the compilation album Exhibition. A live album, Ghost, was culled from the final two shows of the tour (25‚Äì26 September 1987) and released in March 1988. Ghost features live versions of several Strange Charm tracks. Different releases Strange Charm was originally only released in the UK. The original cassette release featured \\"Time to Die\\" as an extra track at the end of side one. The album saw its first CD reissue on Numan's own Numa label in 1991. It was reissued again in 1996. In 1999 the album was reissued in the UK by Eagle Records in remastered form, with five tracks originally released as B-sides as bonus tracks (including \\"Time to Die\\"), new artwork and liner notes. In the same year it was also released in the U.S. by Cleopatra Records, who dropped two of the instrumental bonus tracks of the UK reissue in favour of the extended mixes of \\"New Thing from London Town\\" and \\"I Can't Stop\\". Additionally the U.S. release used a modified version of the original cover and did not feature liner notes.

The film stars Nicholas Tse, Jaycee Chan and Shawn Yue as three police officers who are thrown together due to their backgrounds to bring down a gang of seven criminals led by Tien Yeng-seng (Wu Jing). Plot An armoured truck carrying $100 million of cash is attacked by a criminal gang who call themselves the \\"Ronin Gang\\" with explosives as it stops at a traffic junction in front of a jewellery shop. All the security guards are shot dead except one, while responding police officers suffer serious casualties under the gunfire of the heavily armed gang members. The explosions also kill several civilians, including a lady in the shop. Six months later, the same gang reappears in Hong Kong, injuring a group of policemen, two critically, during a spot check. The dead woman in the jewellery shop is CID detective Chan Chun's fianc√©e, while the injured policemen are led by Trainee Inspector Carson Fong Yik-wai. Both officers vow revenge on the criminal gang. Wai King- ho is a rookie cop whose older brother, Wai King-tat, also a police officer, has been missing for an extended period of time. Deeply upset by police allegations that his brother has become part of the criminal gang while undercover, he is suspended from duty due to his connection to his now wanted brother, and later confronted by both Chan and Fong who demand his brother's whereabouts. They form an alliance after Wai is rescued by Chan and Fong in a fight at a nightclub. Little Tiger, one of the gang members, is captured by Chan and is forced to lead the police to the gang's hideout. The gang appears and kills Tiger after a chase, while injuring Chan and several of his colleagues. It turns out that the surviving security guard is Ho Wing-keung, the manager of the security company, who colluded with the gang to rob the armoured truck. He is tracked down by the gang to a psychiatric hospital, where he feigned a mental breakdown to escape detection by the gang. Chan, Fong and Wai arrive at the hospital, but fail to stop his escape with the gang, which threatened his family to force him out. As the three pursue the gang, they run into an accident scene, where the gang shoots several police officers, hijacks a mini-bus with young children, and takes Wai as a hostage in the bus. Chan and Fong go after the bus with Ho in another car. The gang members and the police officers engage in a lengthy confrontation, in which Wai's brother is revealed as an undercover cop; he is killed by gang member Ronin Tien Yeng-yee. Ho is killed by Tien Yeng-seng, Wai is left handcuffed to the bus with the children and a timed bomb, while Chan and Fong are forced to collect the stolen cash from the robbery's mastermind at a funfair at Tamar while chained to another timed bomb. Wai manages to free himself and rescue all the children, but discovers that the bomb is fake, suggesting that Ronin had no intention of harming the children. Chan and Fong approach a man with a luggage bag at the funfair as instructed, but the man turns out to be Chief Inspector Sam, who is leading an operation to nab the gang. Chan and Fong take Sam hostage and manage to free themselves from the bomb, while explodes harmlessly in a tent. In a secluded area, Chan and Fong explain their situation to Sam. It is then revealed that Sam is also colluding with the mastermind, and when he pulls a gun on Chan and Fong, the two throw him over a railing, killing him. Chan and Fong become suspects for the murder. With the help of Fong's girlfriend Leung Hoi-lam from the Police Intelligence Department, Chan and Fong realise that the real mastermind is Senior Superintendent Cheung Man-yiu, who has orchestrated the armoured truck robbery, double crossed the gang, resulting in the death of three of their members, and made off with the loot, which he keeps hidden in a car in the Police Headquarters car park. The remaining four members of the criminal gang arrive at the Headquarters in a police van masquerading as police officers to get the money back, just before the arrival of Chan, Fong, and Wai. Senior Superintendent Mark Law Pui-keung begins to learn about the truth from data provided by Leung. An extended showdown at the Police Headquarters ensues, resulting in the deaths of three criminals, multiple policemen including a Special Duties Unit squad, and Wai, who is beaten to death by Tien. Chan and Fong almost kill Tien in revenge, but at the last minute realise their duty as a police officer is to arrest, not kill. Cheung throws a bag of grenades, killing Tien in the explosion (along with the remaining money) while Chan and Fong escape with Wai's body. Cheung is later led to an ambulance by unsuspecting officers. He is subsequently shot dead by Chan and Fong when he tries to kill Law in another ambulance. Law lets Chan and Fong go, and they return to their police duties, but as a detective and a beat cop respectively. They also help take care of Wai's grandmother. Distribution Film-based distributor The Weinstein Company picked up multi-territory rights to release Invisible Target in all English-speaking territories. Dragon Dynasty released a \\"two disc ultimate edition\\" DVD in the United States on 10 June 2008, which contains much of the same special features found on the Hong Kong releases.http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2008/07/15/dvd-review-invisible-target A Blu-ray Disc edition of the film by the same company was later released in August 2010. Critical reception The film opened to generally mixed reviews. Writing in Muse magazine, Perry Lam found that 'there is eloquence to the way Benny Chan tells his story,' but ultimately criticizes the film for 'fail[ing] to deliver'.

It occurs in the dry savannahs of north-eastern Africa. Description The pygmy batis, as its name suggests, is a tiny, rather dumpy but dapper black, white and grey bird with similarities to the flycatchers. The male has a bluish-grey head and back with a contrasting black face mask and short white supercilium above the yellow eye. The rump and lower back are spotted with white and the rump feathers are relatively long giving a fluffy appearance. It has black wings which have a broad white strip formed by the broad white edges to feathers of the median and greater coverts, and the inner secondaries and tertials. The tail is black but the outer tail feathers have white edges and tips. The underparts are white, broken with a narrow black breast band. The females are similar to the males but have a pale rufous-buff breast band and chin and the face mask, supercilium and wing stripe are buffy brown. The bill and legs are black. The pygmy batis has a body length of 8‚Äì9 cm and a weight of 5‚Äì9g. Voice The main call of the pygmy batis is a ling series of repeated sharp high pitched whistles. Distribution and habitat The pygmy batis occurs in southern Ethiopia, extreme south eastern South Sudan, southern Somalia, eastern Uganda, inland Kenya and north eastern Tanzania. The preferred habitat is scrub made up of Senegalia spp, Commiphora spp and other \\"thorn\\" species in arid and semi-arid lowlands with rainfall falling between 250mm and 500mm per year. Also found in wooded and bushy grassland, but avoids riverine forest. Habits The pygmy batis is an active, arboreal bird which lives in pairs or small family groups. Its habits are considered to be likely to be similar to other savannah batises. They feed mainly within the foliage and glean most of their insect prey from leaves and twigs, with a small proportion taken on the wing. It will join other bird species in mixed foraging parties. The breeding biology is almost unknown but egg laying probably occurs in February and March.

It occurs in western Africa where it is found in dry savanna and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. It was originally given the binomial name Muscicapa senegalensis by Carl Linnaeus in 1766. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Senegal batis in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name Le gobe-mouche √† poitrine rousse du S√©n√©gal and the Latin Muscicapa Senegalensis pectore rufo. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Senegal batis. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Muscicapa senegalensis and cited Brisson's work. The species is now placed in the genus Batis that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1833. The species is monotypic. Description The Senegal batis is a restless flycatcher-like small bird with the distinctive black, white and grey colours and plumage patterns which are typical of the batises. The adult male has a dark slate grey forehead and crown with a long, broad white supercilium which almost reaches the white nape patch. The face mask is glossy bluish-black. The mantle and upper back are slate grey tinged with brown, the lower back and rump are mottled grey, white and black. The feathers on the rump are long and this gives the rump a fluffy appearance, contrasting with the glossy blue-back uppertail coverts. The wings are brownish black with a white stripe along their length. The underwing coverts are black and the tail is black with white tipped and edged outer tail feathers. The underparts are white, except for the underwing coverts and thighs and the broad glossy blue-black breast band. Adult females are overall paler than males with dusky grey brown forehead and crown, a buff supercilium and nape patch and a black face mask, browner wings and a russet breast band, as well as rufous ting to the chin and upper throat. Juveniles are like duller females. The Senegal batis measures 10 cm in length and weighs 8‚Äì11.4g. Voice The main call of the Senegal batis is a series of medium pitched double and triple note whistles which do not vary in pitch and are frequently introduced with buzzy notes. Distribution and habitat The Senegal batis is found from southern Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia east to Nigeria and north and central Cameroon, east to the Benou√© Plain and Mandara Mountains. The Senegal batis inhabits low dry thorny scrub, sparsely treed grasslands and woody savannahs, including open acacia and baobab woodlands. Behaviour The Senegal batis maintains a territory throughout the year which the male patrols daily, sitting on high open perches and singing. The territory is shared with the female and with any immatures from the previous years, and they are sometimes seen in family groups. If intruders are seen then the male undertakes and aggressive display which involves an upright stance with the bill held vertically, the breast and crown feather fluffed out, swinging his rear end while jerking his tail. In flight the aggressive display is a bouncing flight with the bill held up and the crown and rump fluffed out. It will also aggressively mob shrikes, especially the Brubru with bill snapping and wing fripping but uses different behaviour when mobbing hornbills, cuckoos and pearl-spotted owlets or snakes. When mobbing the owlet it crouches, raises its head and shoulders and flicks its tail, the snakes are mobbed by hovering, rattling calls and bill snapping. It is an arboreal forager and its insect prey is mostly gleaned from foliage, in the outer patrts of branches, sometimes on trunks or stems but almost never on the ground. It will flycatch or hawk insects in the air, making sallies of up to 2m to catch prey from a perch, has also been known to impale larger prey on thorns. The fork-tailed drongo has been recorded as kelptoparasitising prey from the Senegal batis. The breeding season seems to run between January and July. The courtship display is very similar to the territorial aggression display, and the male probably also feeds the female during courtship. The nest is built by both sexes and is a typical batis nest, made of dried grass and strips of bark, decorated with leaves, lichen and bark bound together with spider webs. It is a small neat cup, bound to the fork or thick stem of a bush or tree with spider webs. The nest is often in quite an exposed situation but the decoration seems to act as effective camouflage. Only the female incubates the clutch, which is normally two eggs, for 15 days. The male guards the nest and feeds her, attacking all other birds near the nest, as well as Gambian sun squirrels, but not the striped ground squirrel. The male continues to provide all the food for the females and the young for the first week after hatching, passing food items to the female for her to feed the chicks; after the first week, both sexes forage and feed the chicks. After fledging the young stay in the parents' territory until the start of the next breeding season.

It occurs in eastern Africa, mostly in lowland miombo woodland. Description The pale batis is an active, black, white and grey bird which is pale grey above with a black face mask bordered by a thin white supercilium, yellow eye and a pale grey back, mottled with faint white spots. It has white underparts marked with a black band across the breast in males; females have a pale rufous breast band and a similar coloured spot on the chin. The bill and legs are black. Immature birds are similar to the female except that the breast band is browner and the underparts have a buffy wash. The pale batis measures 10.5‚Äì11.5 cm in length and weighs 8‚Äì13.1 g. Voice The territorial call of the pale batis is a repeated, mournful, long and piping 3-note ‚Äúpook pook pook‚Äù which is repeated up to 12 times at a constant rate, with which the female duets giving excited \\"wik-wik\\" calls. Otherwise the repertoire consists of typical batis bill snaps, churrs and whistles. Distribution Eastern Africa from coastal Kenya including the Arabuko Sokoke National Park south through eastern and south-eastern Tanzania, the islands of Zanzibar and Mafia, to Mozambique as far south as the Save River, inland to south eastern Malawi, and the east-facing slopes of the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. Habitat The pale batis typically occurs in lowland miombo woodland, normally below 500 m in coastal woodlands where there is a mosaic of forest and dense scrub. Can also be found in mopane and acacia around the edges of its distribution. In the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe it is found up to 1,500 m above sea level in tall Uapaca kirkiana stands, thickets of Philippia spp. and woodland dominated mountain acacia. Habits Little is known about the feeding habits of the pale batis, other than that it forages by gleaning insects from leaves and branches, it occasionally gleans while hovering and it often joins mixed foraging parties. Its social behaviour is probably similar to other batises in that it is not normally seen in groups larger than pairs or family groups, although the males may gather in single sex aggregations known as \\"parliaments\\" immediately prior to the breeding season, when they fly about excitedly, snapping their bills, fripping their wings and making \\"wik\\" calls. The male has a zigzag courtship display flight which he performs along with wing fripping, tail fanning and fluffing up the long, white spotted rump feathers while giving strident \\"week-week-week\\" calls. The females joins in the calls with her own excited \\"wik-wik\\" call. The nest of the pale batis is a small, deep cup built of thin strips of Combretum bark and fragments of grass inflorescences, held together with spiders webs. The nest is normally situated in the fork of a branch which is at least 6m above the ground, a small clutch of about 1-2 eggs is usually laid during the period September‚ÄìNovember. The female is responsible for all of the incubation and initially she carries out all the feeding of the young, the male joins in feeding when the chicks are older. Only the immediate vicinity of the nest is defended.

This small bird is found on the forest floor and undergrowth of dense forest patches sheltered in the valleys of montane grassland, a restricted and threatened habitat. The white-bellied blue robin was formerly considered conspecific with this species but in 2005 the two taxa were split by Pamela C. Rasmussen, a treatment that is followed by some authorities. Their genus remained uncertain until a 2017 molecular phylogenetic study found that these two south Indian species formed a sister group to a clade containing the genera Eumyias, Niltava and Cyornis. A new genus Sholicola was therefore erected for these two species. Description Nilgiri blue robin at Coonoor This chat-like bird is long-legged and appears chunky with its short tail and wing. Although sharing similar habits and shape, the two species differ in plumage and both may show slight sexual dimorphism. Females may differ from males in iris colour at least in S. albiventris. The Nilgiri blue robin (S. major) has the lores black and the upperside, the throat, breast are dark slaty blue but the lower plumage is rufous. The centre of the belly is buffy white. The brow is not as well-marked as in the other species and is diffuse bluish. Taxonomy and systematics Thomas C. Jerdon obtained a specimen of the rufous-bellied species from the Nilgiris and called it Phaenicura major (\\"Large Red-start\\") in 1844 but Edward Blyth suggested that the species should be placed in the genus Callene that he had separated from the already extant Brachypteryx, a genus in which he also placed the blue-fronted robin (now Cinclidium frontale then Callene frontalis). Jerdon then suggested the new name of Callene rufiventris, a name not used due to the priority given to the names first proposed. Eugene Oates in the first edition of The Fauna of British India moved the species back into the genus Brachypteryx stating that they were congeneric with Brachypteryx cruralis while also noting that the young birds were speckled as in true-thrushes like Callene (as represented by the blue-fronted robin). Oates also used the name \\"Rufous-bellied Short-wing\\". This genus placement was carried on in the second edition of The Fauna of British India (1924) by E. C. Stuart Baker but was demoted into a subspecies on the basis of a specimen collected by T. F. Bourdillon at Mynal which was claimed to be intermediate to the two forms. Claud Buchanan Ticehurst in 1939 reaffirmed the genus placement. This treatment as subspecies was carried forward by Salim Ali and Sidney Dillon Ripley in their \\"Handbook\\" until the old two species were restored by P C Rasmussen in 2005. In the Birds of South Asia (2005), however they moved the species tentatively into the genus Myiomela based on morphological similarities and pointed out that the placement in Brachypteryx was in error (as Brachypteryx is strongly sexually dimorphic). Plumage of Sholicola major underside showing the rufous flanks and white belly In 2010, DNA sequence studies suggested an ancient divergence in these two populations and confirmed their elevation to full species. The genus position was however not settled. Another 2010 molecular phylogenetics study suggested that the genus Brachypteryx (the taxa sampled however, did not include the peninsular Indian forms) which was earlier thought to belong to the thrush family Turdidae belonged to the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The type species of Brachypteryx, B. montana, shows strong sexual dimorphism. A 2017 study found that the species from southern India formed a group that is a sister to the clade (treated as subfamily Niltavinae) of flycatchers in the genera Eumyias, Cyanoptila, Niltava, Cyornis and Anthipes and the new genus of Sholicola was erected for them. Habitat and distribution Its natural habitat is forest patches in the valleys of high altitude grasslands known as sholas. The species has been found to occur only above 1200 m altitude in the higher hill ranges of Western Ghats. These forest patches are highly restricted in size and the species is thus threatened by habitat loss. Populations of S. major are found in the Nilgiris, the Bababudan hills and the Brahmagiris. Behaviour and ecology These birds are found in dense forest in the dark lower canopy and forest floor. They are skulking but can be confiding. They call frequently with tit-like notes and harsh rattles. The song of S. major is said to be series of shrill whistles and twangy buzzing sounds. Geographically isolated populations show variations in their songs. Birds have been noted to moult their tail feathers in the beginning of June. Little is known of their dispersal, longevity and other aspects of life history although more than 133 birds have been ringed. Two greyish green and brown-marked eggs are laid during the breeding season that varies from April to June, after the rains. The nest is placed in a tree hole or placed on a bank and is made of moss and fibrous roots and placed low over the ground. The incubation period is about 16 to 17 days. Both parents share the nesting duties like incubation and feeding the nestlings. Old nests from the previous year may sometimes be reused.

Description The chat flycatcher is an earthy light reddish-brown in colour and has large, pale wing edges. Juvenile flycatchers have speckled feathers. The flycatcher produces a song that consists of a \\"cher cher chirrup\\" sound. The bird is about twenty centimeters long.  Habitat  The chat flycatcher is found in South Africa, Botswana and Angola. The flycatcher frequently perches on low-lying bushes and telephone wires. Its natural habitat is dry savanna. However, it is also found in shrublands and woodlands throughout its range. Behavior Diet The chat flycatcher hunts insects. Specifically, it consumes termites, ants and beetles. The flycatcher also consumes small reptiles such as Typhlops, a genus of blind snakes. Reproduction The chat flycatcher lays eggs year round. However, egg laying is believed to peak from September to March, a period of increased rainfall in the habitat of the flycatcher. The flycatcher lays an average of two to three eggs. The chat flycatcher nests above ground in shrubs and thickets. The mother incubates the eggs for approximately two weeks, while the father is responsible for ensuring that the female is fed. After the eggs hatch, the hatchlings are raised and fed by their parents. They tend to leave the nest anywhere from eleven to fourteen days after hatching. Conservation status The chat flycatcher is categorized as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Biography Duck was born at Charlton, near Pewsey, in Wiltshire. Little is known about Duck's family, whether from Duck himself or from contemporary records, except that they were labourers and very poor. Duck attended a charity school and left at the age of thirteen to begin working in the fields. Around 1724, he married as his first wife Ann, who died in 1730, and began to attempt to better himself and escape the toil and poverty of agricultural work. Encouraged by the village squire, schoolmaster and rector he read Milton, Dryden, Prior, and The Spectator, as well as the Holy Bible, according to Joseph Spence.Duck came by a copy of Paradise Lost by chance, which he read over \\"twice or thrice with a dictionary before he could understand‚Ä¶it thoroughly\\". He took particular note of Addison's \\"Criticisms of Milton's Paradise Lost\\", from issues of The Spectator of January 1712: Rising in Popularity He was \\"discovered\\" by Alured Clarke of Winchester Cathedral, and Clarke introduced him to high society. Clarke and Spence (the Professor of Poetry at Oxford University and friend of Alexander Pope) promoted Duck as a sincerely pious man of sober wit. Clarke and Spence saw poetry that Duck was writing, but none of this verse was published. Between 1724 and 1730, he and Ann, his late wife, had three children. In 1730, Duck combined some of the poetic pieces he had been writing and wrote The Thresher's Labour, a poem that described the difficulty of field work. The poem was celebrated throughout London society, and he soon wrote The Shunammite, which reflected Duck's piety and religious imagination. The poet was taken to meet Queen Caroline, and, while he was there, word came of the death of his wife, but Clarke kept the news from Duck until after the interview with the Queen. For her part, she was pleased and gave Duck an annuity and a small house. Duck continued to write and to be seen as both a paradigm of self-improvement and the natural poet. In 1733, Duck was made a Yeoman of the Guard by the queen, and that year he met and married Sarah Big, Caroline's housekeeper at Kew. In 1735, Caroline made him keeper of Merlin's Cave (a thatched folly containing waxworks) in Richmond Park, where he had once worked as a gardener. During this period, Duck wrote many poems, with increasing polish and urbanity. His Poems in 1736 had both Pope and Jonathan Swift as subscribers. Reception Swift and Pope both made disparaging remarks or outright satires on Duck. Between 1731 and 1733, Swift satirized the poverty of Duck's rhymes in several pieces. The Times was later to deride Duck's verse, in comparison to that of Swift, as a \\"[j]ingling train\\" : However, both men seemed to like Stephen Duck as a person, and both were impressed by his religious sincerity. When Duck was rumored to be a candidate for the Laureate, this distinction between the private man and the quality of the verse made him a worthy target. When Queen Caroline died in 1737, Duck was left without a patron and without direct inspiration. He wrote eight very long poems after her death. In 1744, Sarah Big Duck died, and Stephen married again, although this wife's name is unknown. Duck was ordained in 1746 and became chaplain to Henry Cornwall and then to Ligonier's forces in 1750 before becoming the chaplain of Kew. He went on to serve as the pastor of Byfleet, Surrey, where he was well liked by his congregation. On 21 March 1756 Duck, overwhelmed by the strain caused by his deep change in social status, committed suicide by drowning. An annual commemorative feast, the Duck Feast, is held at the Charlton Cat inn in the village of his birth. It is funded by the revenue from a field (\\"Duck's Acre\\") presented by Lord Palmerston, to whom Duck had dedicated a volume of poetry. Duck presided at the first feast, writing: Since the 1990s, Duck has seen renewed interest among New Historicist and Marxist literary critics. Duck's case featured in The New Eighteenth Century (Landry), and this inspired further critical work.

Originally built around Cardowan Colliery, Garnkirk fire-clay works and clay mines in the immediate area, Cardowan's proximity to Glasgow has been key to its expansion over the years, which has seen the former colliery site being transformed into a large scale residential development. In November 2019 the residents of Cardowan formed a committee of Cardowan Community Meadow to take ownership of Craigendmuir farmland, the last piece of accessible green space within the community to create a community area and stop housing companies from stealing the space to build more houses. History The oldest documented reference to Cardowan comes from the Charters of David I of Scotland regarding the lands around Cardowan, Easter Cardowan, and Cardowan Muir. These areas of land currently include the Forestry Commission's Cardowan Moss and the village of Cardowan. The oldest surviving buildings in the area are St. Joseph's RC Church, the original St. Joseph's School, Craigendmuir House, as well as older structures in adjacent Stepps. Excluding Cardowan Drive and the northern end of Cardowan Road which are often regarded as being part of Stepps, the earliest housing in the area which is still existing was built in the late 1930s to early 40s and served to replace housing in the (now extinct) nearby villages of Garnkirk and Heathfield. The streets of Cardowan Road, Clayhouse Road, and Frankfield Road were constructed first, with the easternmost end of the latter being renamed Ardtoe Crescent and Place and Dorlin Road a short time later. Thereafter further housing was built in the 1950s creating the streets of Craigendmuir Road, Comedie Road and an extension to Clayhouse Road. Following this in the 1960s, Drimnin Road, and Mossview Road (including Resipol Road and Gaskin Path) were completed. Due to the shortages of building materials during the second World War the last five blocks on Frankfield Road were built with flat roofs which were only replaced in the 1980s. The 1980s also brought the construction of Blaneview and further housing on Clayhouse Road, and in the 1990s Nicholson Court was built on the site of the original Stepps railway station and sidings. Cardowan Colliery The mine at Cardowan was the site of several accidents including the explosion of 1927 in which on 1 August at 3:50pm 3 men were killed. (John Kilpatrick, Maurice M'Bride, George Jackson) A further explosion occurred in 1932 on 16 November in which 11 men were killed. (William Bradley, Michael Flynn, Peter Frati (formerly Jacobelli), William McAlister, John McNab, James McVey, Richard Maroney, George Mullen, James Reynolds, John Watt, John Whiteford) Then again in Jan 1982 there was another explosion at some 1700 feet underground and 2 miles from the pithead, resulting in 41 injuries. The mine finally closed at the end of 1983. Transport The fastest method of public transport to Glasgow or Cumbernauld is by train from .

The inhabitants of the commune are known as Alteckendorfois or AlteckendorfoisesInhabitants of Bas-Rhin Geography Alteckendorf is about 30 km north-west of Strasbourg and 20 km east of Saverne. Covering an area of 572 hectares, the commune is located on the plain of Alsace and more specifically in the area of some loess hills behind Kochersberg and between the Vosges Mountains and Germany. The town is located 177 metres above sea level and is watered by the Landgraben stream, a tributary of the Zorn. It is surrounded by the Koppenberg (256 metres), Englischberg (288 metres), and Schyrberg (250 metres) hills. To the north of the town is the Alteckendorf forest. The Sarreguemines-Strasbourg railway runs through the commune with a station on the south-east edge of the village. Neighbouring localities within a radius of 5 kilometres include Minversheim, Ettendorf, Huttendorf, Ringendorf, Lixhausen, Bossendorf, Hochfelden and Schwindratzheim. Alteckendorf is approximately an hour by car from Strasbourg and is near the famous militarily historical town of Haguenau.

Climate The type of climate prevailing in Alteckendorf is a degraded oceanic climate with a relatively large amplitude of temperature. Thus snowfall is fairly common in winter while some summer days can be hot and stuffy. Situated between two mountain ranges (the Vosges and the Black Forest) the village has little exposure to wind. Similarly, rainfall is relatively scarce and irregular compared to other French regions, with natural protection against the prevailing westerly winds from the Vosges (foehn effect). The town is often subject to violent storms in spring and summer. The most devastating occurred on 18 and 30 May 2008 when floods and mudslides invaded homes.Alt'echos (Communal Bulletin of Information), Nos. 1 and 2, 2008 Hydrology The communal territory of Alteckendorf is not crossed by streams of significant importance. There however two streams: the Minversheimerbach and Schweingraben. The Minversheimerbach has its source in the north in the commune of Buswiller. It flows south through Ettendorf then through Alteckendorf and Minversheim. At Mommenheim, this modest stream empties into the river Zorn. The Schweingraben or Schweinbachgraben (in English: \\"the pigs' stream\\") is a river that marks part of the eastern border of Alteckendorf. This stream has its source north of the village in the territory of Grassendorf. It flows south to join the Minversheimerbach southwest of Minversheim. Vegetation The entire commune has been dedicated to agriculture for many centuries. The first written references date back to the 8th century when the abbey of Wissembourg declared themselves the owners of Alteckendorf. The landscape is entirely shaped by the hand of man and there is little room for wilderness. The oldest map describing the territory dates back to the year 1760.Conserved in the Departmental Archives of Bas-Rhin under the code C556(4) Of a total of 1051.06 arpents, 635.70 arpents are devoted to arable land, 125.72 arpents of meadows, 118.78 arpents of pastures, 84.40 arpents of vineyards, 48.20 arpents of forest, and 38.26 arpents of orchards and houses. Urbanism, a merger of two village communities upright=1.8 Toponymy The present village of Alteckendorf is the result of the merger of two distinct communities. The village of Eckendorf is mentioned in the year 742 under the name Echanhaime.Soci√©t√© historique du Palatinat, Traditiones possessionesque wizenburgenes, Spire, 1842, 390 pages, passage 53 Line 22. Read echanhaime in place of ethanhaime in the corrigenda on page 390, Read online: consulted on 10 February 2011 Subsequently, the name was again mentioned in 744 with various spellings such as: Ecchenheim (744),historique du Palatinat, Traditiones possessionesque wizenburgenes, Spire, 1842, 390 pages, consulted on 10 February 2011 Ecchenheimomarca (in 764 and 792),Soci√©t√© historique du Palatinat, Traditiones possessionesque wizenburgenes, Spire, 1842, 390 pages, consulted on 10 February 2011 and Ecchenthorf, Ekkendorf, Ekindorf.p. 12. Es waren zwei D√∂rfer (German) The Abbey of Wissembourg was listed as the landowner from 752‚Äì787. In 1120, the monastery at Mauerm√ºnster-Sindelsberg was named as the landowner. In 1146 it was recorded that the knight Simon de Frundsberg ceded his possessions at Ekindork for \\"16¬Ω l√∂tig Silberst√ºcke\\" to the Abbey of St√ºrzelbronn. In 1194, the monastery at Neuburg was the landowner of Eckendorf.idem Altdorf does not appear until later in history with a completely different name: perhaps Mazonivilare, because it is recorded in a document of 752 that Sigfrid, son of Sigismund gave up his property of \\"Villa Ecchenheimo et Mazonivilare\\". No mention of the village occurs later; it was undoubtedly destroyed during a war and when the inhabitants returned they named the place Altdorf (old village).p. 12. Es waren zwei D√∂rfer The name Altdorf does not appear until 1331. The name Oberaltdorf was also used to distinguish this village from the nearby hamlet of Niederaltdorf. The name Eckendorf is formed from Eck(e) meaning \\"corner\\" or \\"locality\\" followed by the appellative Dorf meaning \\"village\\" that is to say \\"local village\\" according to Ernest Negro.General Toponymy of France, Librairie Droz 1991. p. 722. The name of the hamlet of Oberaltdorf can be translated as \\"high old village\\". The two villages were united in 1777 and called Alt und Eckendorf then throughout the 19th century Alt-Eckendorf and finally since the beginning of the 20th century Alteckendorf. Even today two localities on the cadastral map located one kilometre north of Eckendorf bear the names Weilerh√∂ltzel and Weilerberg. Weiler is the German word for \\"hamlet\\" (in German the spelling is willer) and comes from the Latin word villare meaning \\"farm\\" derived from villa rustica. It must be assumed that these places once existed although now deserted and forgotten. The year 1777 is generally advanced as that of the union of the two villages. The parish chronicle reports that, to mark the event, a celebration was held midway between the two locations. This merger however was part of a broader movement both before and after that date so rather than a union it was more a gradual process of fusion. History of the fusion process Alteckendorf was once part of the Bailiwick of Pfaffenhoffen which reported to the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg. It was created in 1777 by the merger of the Eckendorf village community with that of the neighbouring hamlet of Oberaltdorf (or Altdorf). The two villages became French in 1680, when their lord, the Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg, submitted to the authority of Louis XIV at the expense of the Holy Roman Empire. Like the rest of Alsace, the village again became German between 1871 and 1918 and between 1940 and 1944. Originally affiliated to the Parish of Minversheim,Disappeared Villages of Alsace, page 32, cahier 37-39, 1962, SHASE in 1474 Eckendorf and Altdorf formed an independent parish, first Catholic then Lutheran from 1545. In 1577 both villages were assigned a common seal. This seal showed Saint Martin, patron saint of the chapel of Altdorf. This unique seal shows that Eckendorf and Altdorf were already linked administratively and the Lord of Hanau- Lichtenberg was represented in the two villages with a single Schulthei√ü, the custodian of the seal of the two communities. The Schulthei√ü exercised judicial authority in the Gericht, a village court consisting of seven Schoeffen (aldermen). The sentences and fines were imposed based on the Dorfordnung, village regulations which were at first an oral then a written codification of customs and usage from the Middle Ages. In 1662 a unique terrierA register containing the laws and usages of a Lordship. was written which listed all the landowners of the two villages. This was the Oberalt und Eckendorffer GeneralbannerneuerungsprotocollPreserved in the Departmental Archives of Strasbourg under the code E2314. established by the Schulthei√ü Dieboldthansen Dieboldt with five aldermen of the village court. This paper demonstrates that both villages had only one communal territory at least a century before the union of 1777. After the annexation of Alsace to France by Louis XIV a Protestant could not be the Schulthei√ü. Also within the Lutheran county of Hanau-Lichtenberg, the Schulthei√üs were replaced by Stabhalter which was simply a name change. From 19 March 1769 to 31 March 1790 this post was held by Johann Richert at Alteckendorf. This Stabhalter was in charge eight years before the celebration of the union of 1777 and for the next thirteen years. As an aside it can be argued that the Napoleonic prefectural authority did continue the local political career of Stabhalter Johann Richert by naming him Mayor of Alteckendorf from 1800 to 1813. What then is the significance of the year 1777? Before the Revolution the rural population of Alsace was divided roughly into two categories: Schirmer (peasants) and B√ºrger (bourgeois). Each year, the citizens of Eckendorf elected a B√ºrgermeister (chief bourgeois) responsible for financing the bourgeois community and for taxes that the latter had to pay. The citizens of Altdorf did the same. It was this function that was merged in 1777. Before that date and since time immemorial the two village communities each had their own B√ºrgermeister even though they had a single village court headed by a Schulthei√ü from one of these two bourgeois communities appointed by the Lord of the manor. The geographical merger Alteckendorf in 1760 and 1828 Alteckendorf in 1900 Alteckendorf in 2010 The merger of the two communities endorsed in the year 1777 was not challenged in 1790 when the administrative reorganization of the Revolution took place. The two villages remained linked in a single new municipality. However, the cadastral plan of 1828, like its preceding land plan in 1760, still showed two distinct villages. Eckendorf is separated from Altdorf by meadows but localities are connected by a path then called the Laubweg. The Laubweg Path The German word Laubweg is composed of the word Weg meaning \\"path\\" and the word Laub which means \\"foliage\\", die Laube translates as \\"the tree\\". The Laubweg refers to the pre-revolutionary concept of village justice mentioned above. The court of Gericht led by the Schulthei√ü sat, in the 14th and 15th centuries, in a house open to all the winds to ensure publicity of its discussions. This house called die Laube was better than the public square located in the shade of the village linden trees which was used previously for debates. Today, the old building of the former town hall of Bischwiller is called die Laub. The plan of the territory of Alteckendorf in 1760 indicated a building erected midway between the two towns not far from the current Rue Mercier (the ancient Herrenweg) the path of the Lords leading to Pfaffenhoffen, the chief town of the Bailiwick on which Alteckendorf depended. There can be seen the building of the Laub Alteckendorf. The cadastral map of 1828 shows construction in the same place. It is unclear if this is the same building. The end of duplicate communal buildings If the cadastral map of 1828 does not provide certainty as to the existence or not of Laub Alteckendorf at that date, it does nevertheless indicate that the commune of Alteckendorf had several duplicate buildings in Eckendorf and Altdorf. Two churches, two schools and two police stations. Although the two churches still exist in 2010, in 1835 other buildings were grouped into a single building. One school for 150 students, a house for the teacher, the offices of the Town Hall and the police. This construction, which was razed in 1999 to make way for a more modern school, was at the supposed site of the old Laub. The construction of the single school/town hall was the real starting point for the construction of other buildings along the Laubweg. At the beginning of the 20th century this intermediate zone was completely occupied by farms of varying size. During the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in the German Second Reich, the Laubweg took the names of Dorfgasse or Hauptstrasse. It is this last name that continues today through its translations to French (Rue Principal) and Alsatian (Hauptstross). After the Second World War the mayor, for the sake of economy, suggested an idea to raze the two churches which were the property of the commune, and replace them by a single building. This proposal was quickly aborted. The habitat The building of the \\"Buredewels\\" farm built in 1809 in Altdorf and photographed one hundred years later. The house today The oldest farms are the half- timbered houses that were built in the traditional Alsatian architectural style. The frame of the building is wooden with a filling of mud, the foundations being stone. These mixed farms all have more or less the same basic plan. They are composed of several buildings around a courtyard. The main house, with or without a first floor, is oriented towards the street (with rare exceptions). On the other side of the court are the stables and cowsheds with a barn in the back. The yard is separated from the street by a large gate. Visible from the street are the names of the builders with the date of construction on the buildings or the gates. No construction dates back before the 18th century. Farms rebuilt at the beginning of the 19th century are all within Eckendorf and Oberaltdorf. Those built in the middle of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries are located along the main street. From the last third of the 19th century the builders gradually abandoned wood and mud in favour of baked bricks, the traditional plan, however, was preserved. In 1999 there were 265 lodgings but ten were vacant and three were second homes; 80% were houses and 14% were apartments; 88.1% are 4 rooms or more and 77% are owner-occupied. Between 2008 and 2010 two new districts were created. These subdivisions called Clos Saint Georges in Eckendorf and les Vergers in Altdorf consist of forty dwellings. The municipality, having bought in 2009 two former farms at Eckendorf next to the subdivision of Clos Saint Georges, decided to turn them into a set of eight rental lodgings with a multi-service store. History Middle Ages and Renaissance Before 744 the two villages were imperial possessions. In the 18th Century they were in the possession of Landgraf von Werd in his capacity as the Abbot of the fief of Wissembourg. The first mention of a church in the two villages was in 1313 when Rudolf von H√ºttendorf, son of Burckhard, knight of H√ºttendorf was installed as rector of the church. Possession of the lords of Lichtenberg In the year 1331, the two villages were fiefs of Ludwig von Onovilsheim. The following year, in 1332, they came as a legacy to Hanemann II and to Ludemann III, both Lords of Lichtenberg. After this succession the two squires received with Brumath and the Castle of Grand Arnsberg a series of villages including Altdorf and Eckendorf. This possession was shared between the children of Ludemann III. Simon received among others Altdorf and Eckendorf.p. 13 Lichtenbergisches Gut After the Lords of Lichtenberg had entered into possession of the two villages, they settled in the Eckendorf castle, a feudal lordship that took the name Eckendorf. From 1334 there are the names of Hans von Eckendorf but also Blass, Fritsch, Ludwig, and G√∂tze. This last was Priest and Canon in Saint-√âtienne of Strasbourg in 1365. In 1356 Knight Ludwig von Eckendorf took an oath of citizenship in Strasbourg. In 1384 Ludwig received Lord Ottemann at Ochsenstein, at the fiefs of Furchhausen, Wolschheim, Dettwiller, Hegeney, and Hochfelden. On 12 September 1390 Ludwig von Eckendorf participated in a tournament at Strasbourg. In the middle of the 14th century the nobles of Eckendorf lived in Strasbourg.p. 13 Lichtenbergisches Gut and p. 91 The Noble family of Eckendorf (German) In the year 1365 Knight Hans Zuckmantel the elder was confirmed in his fief at Eckendorf. He succeeded Ludwig von Eckendorf and Otto von Hochfelden, son of Ottemann. These last possessed between them the castle of Eckendorf and the rights to tithe at Eckendorf. Hans Zuckmantel was originally from Silesia. He was a knight in the castle of Brumath with the nobles of Weitersheim with whom he shared arms.

The Armorial of Louis XIV,Departmental Archives of Bas-Rhin, Arms of the communes of Bas- Rhin, passage 53, Illkirch, imprimerie Valblor, 1995, 246 pages took back the seal and revealed a new seal, in heraldic language, for the communities and Oberaltorff Exquendorff: Azure, Saint Martin cutting his cloak in half to give to a pauper sitting sinister, the saint to dexter of a pile of a church set on a hill, all Or. However, the heraldic commission created by the prefect of the Bas-Rhin in 1946 changed this blazon by simplifying it to: Or, the yoke of Saint Martin Azure. However, the municipality was not aware of this work and used a shield representing an apple upside down until 1990. Learning of the existence of the 1577 seal, they decided to adopt a design inspired by that shield. The simplified shield created by the heraldic commission was never used by the municipality. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War From 1618 to 1648 the Thirty Years' War ravaged Europe. Alsace was in the front line. For this period there is a lack of descriptions or reliable statistics on Alteckendorf and more broadly for the entire County of Hanau-Lichtenberg to which the village belonged. It is therefore difficult to get a clear idea. The Battle of Pfaffenhoffen, 31 July 1633 Based on information found in the parish records of the surrounding villages, the county seemed to be in a sad state. Bouxwiller, its capital, was inhabited in 1634 by only eight people. In 1639 Printzheim had only three inhabitants; Ernolsheim-l√®s-Saverne had no more than five men, two widows, and a child; Imbsheim and Kirrwiller had no inhabitants at all. Also in 1639, at Hattmatt, there were no longer any townsfolk and only three cultivated fields.Walter Bodmer, Swiss Immigration in the county of Hanau-Lichtenberg in the 17th century, Strasbourg, Editions Heintz, 1930, Rather than conclude that there was a general massacre, it is more reasonable to assume a migration of villagers before the enemy troops. The pastor of Pfaffenhoffen clearly indicated in one of his books that he had to flee with his parishioners to Lichtenberg and he returned on 10 March 1634. He was found to have recorded no baptisms between 15 May 1633 and 10 August 1634. It was during this time that Pfaffenhoffen and its surroundings were the scene of a battle between 31 July and 1 August 1633, between the victorious Swedish Infantry of the Prince of Birkenfeld and the Lorraine Imperial troops. Another migration occurred between 24 October 1635 and 8 July 1637 when there was also no baptisms registered at Pfaffenhoffen.Richard Schmidt, Pfaffenhoffen and Niedermodern, Protestant Parish Registers, Births, Baptisms. Marriages, Deaths (1568‚Äì1720), publication Cercle G√©n√©alogique d'Alsace, section de Brumath, 2006, 268 pages, As discussed below, for several years migrations of the populations of Pfaffenhoffen and Alteckendorf were spread over much the same periods. The city of Bouxwiller, a haven for Alteckendorfois At that time, cities were surrounded by walls and were better defended militarily. Alsatian towns served as a refuge for rural populations. Saverne, which was then a populated city of 2,000 inhabitants, during the invasion of Mansfeld in 1622 hosted more than 1,600 refugees from 33 different villages.Jean Michel Boehler, A Rural Society in the Rhineland: the peasants of the plain of Alsace. P.U.S. 1994 Vol. 1, page 183 to 194. Strasbourg, a city of 25,000 inhabitants, identified in January 1622, 9,812 refugees who had come from the surrounding villages with their livestock and reserves of wine, flour and cereals. This overcrowding led to plague epidemics that caused 4,388 deaths in that year in Strasbourg.Jean pierre Kintz, Strasbourg City Refuge in Scenes of the History of Alsace 16th-20th centuries, FSHAA, June 2008 By studying the Lutheran parish records of Bouxwiller between 1618 and 1648 it appears that this small town had also seen a large population of refugees. In the worst years, these fugitives were from twenty to thirty villages. Most of these places are located south and southeast of Bouxwiller and the villages were predominantly Lutheran. These were in the immediate surroundings of Kirrwiller and Bosselshausen and in more distant places such as Duntzenheim located more than 13 kilometres away in a direct line. The inhabitants of Catholic villages are also mentioned such as: Lixhausen, Bossendorf, and Ettendorf for example. For the inhabitants of Alteckendorf, three peaks can be distinguished of their presence in Bouxwiller.67005 Alteckendorf, G√©n√©awiki, consulted on 12 February 2010 The first flight of April‚ÄìMay 1622 was the result of the invasion by General Mansfeld of Alsace. The hardest period for Alteckendorfois during the conflict seems to have been between 1633 and 1636. Therefore, most of the acts of baptisms and burials of the people of Alteckendorf registered at Bouxwiller were first between May 1633 and April 1634 with 13 baptisms and 19 funerals. Then secondly between October 1635 and November 1636 with 5 baptisms and 38 funerals, including that of the Schulthei√ü of Alteckendorf, Hans Ziller, on 12 March 1636.Richard Schmidt, Bouxwiller and Riedheim, Protestant Parishional Registers, baptisms, marriages, deaths (1568‚Äì1699) in 3 volumes, publication Cercle G√©n√©alogique d'Alsace, section de Brumath, 2008, 268 pages, , , The long return to normality This conflict undoubtedly affected Alteckendorf. At a minimum the authority exercised by the lordship of the county which had organized religious life since the introduction of the Protestant Reformation in 1545 was no longer able to provide a dedicated pastor from 1622 to 1654. At the height of the unrest and the epidemics the parish was served by deacons from Bouxwiller. Georg Burkhard Knoderer was mentioned in 1622 as pastor of Alteckendorf but during this year one of his children was buried in Bouxwiller, a victim of the plague. After the end of the conflict of 1650 to 1654 Alteckendorf is served by Pastor Zinck from the nearby village of Schwindratzheim. Then, the county's administration was reorganized and from 1654 to 1658 Pastor Johann Georg Ledermann was appointed to the parish. His successor from 1658 to 1680 was Johann Schmeder. According to historian Rodolphe Reuss,History of Alsace in the 17th century, Rodolphe Reuss in 1660 he received 35 Gulden (florins), 20 quartautsA Quartaut is a quarter of a hogshead or about 68.5 litres. See \\"Quartaut\\" in the French wikipedia. of rye, 5 quartauts of wheat, two quartauts of oats and half a cask (about 465.5 litres) of wine. For his role as schoolmaster, he received 50 bales of straw, 50 bundles of sticks and for each child a tuition fee of 2 shillings and 6 pfennig for each term (three terms per year). Local parish registers recorded baptisms, marriages and deaths from 1654 and in 1658 there were two pastors. The ancient books were lost during the conflict. At the end of the war Alteckendorf had a deficit of population. In 1618, before the conflict, the village had 68 households of townsfolk. At the end of hostilities in 1649‚Äì50 there were only 16 households remaining. The peasant population was bout 340 people (estimated from 80 households).Jean-Michel Boehler, 'A Rural Society of the Middle Rhineland: The Peasantry of the plain of Alsace, Vol. 1, pages 180-181, Strasbourg, Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1995, 222 pages, From the marriage register of the Lutheran parish it appears that the two communities of Eckendorf and Oberaltdorf filled the gap by welcoming more population from 1659 to 1725: mostly consisting of thirty Swiss immigrants, of Protestant origin from the Canton of Berne and four German W√ºrttembergers.Parish Register of Marriages for Alteckendorf from 1658 to 1792. However, these migrants lived in a place adjoining the village. The village community had not been completely decimated by the conflict.Remark: The list of marriages of the Swiss immigrants can be found online at: Alteckendorf sur la G√©n√©awiki Moreover, Oberalt und Bann Eckendorffer General Erneuerungs ProtocollThis document is available at the Departmental Archives of Bas-Rhin in Strasbourg under code E2314. (Book of general renewal of finage (boundaries of the village) for Oberaltdorf and Eckendorf) relates that many fields were no longer cultivated by the owners. These uncultivated lands were assigned to the Swiss immigrants such as Adam Gebweiler, Heinrich Fechter, and Peter W√∂lling. The Ancien R√©gime The Eckendorf Castle in 1702 Suggested site of the vanished castle of Eckendorf The military engineer Guillin in the service of King Louis XIV left a description of a large part of Alsace from a military point of view. His interest was focused on all buildings that may have a use for war or defence (towers, castles, walls and ramparts). Here is his description of Alteckendorf: Oberaldorff is a place in the bottom in which there is a small chapel. Eckendorff is located near the bottom of a small creek with a church that has a non-arched belfry. The cemetery is covered in undergrowth. It is said that there is a good castle on the edge of the creek that forms a square face with sides of width 20 Toises flanked by three towers with battlements. The walls are 15 feet high on the ground floor and 2 to 3 feet thick in good condition surrounded by a large ditch full of water 30 to 40 feet across and 6 feet deep while the inside of the castle has been burned..Military Engineer Guillin, Extract from his Report preserved in the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Memoires and documents section, Alsace collection, Vol. 13, folios 159 to 168 According to the statements of Guillin, it is clear that the Eckendorf Castle, today gone, was a military building of the Wasserburg type. The body of the castle was a square of 39 metres. Its walls had a thickness of 65 to 95 cm and a height of about 5 metres. There was a gap in the defences probably filled with water from the Landgraben stream. This gap was 10 to 13 metres wide with a depth of 2 metres. Union of two villages The villages of Altdorf and Eckendorf, from 1474 were a single parish but they actually merged in 1777. On this occasion a feast was celebrated midway between the two locations, near a spinney called \\"die Laube\\". Censuses, migrations, and statistics The plan of 1760 shows two distinct villages (in pink)Departmental Archives of bas-Rhin, document code C556(4) In 1720, 55 fires are listed but in 1750 there were only 51.Collective, Alteckendorf, two bell towers, one village, Strasbourg, passage 64, Editions Coprur, 1991, 224 pages, . Also consult the article Feu fiscal Historians generally apply a factor of 5 giving an estimate of 500 people in 100 households. The village population can then be estimated at approximately 275 people in 1720 and 255 in 1755. This figure is probably an underestimate, since in the census of 1793, 531 people were counted. One of the probable causes of the decline of the local population was religious and economic immigration to the New World. Among other migrants there was Catharina Ruch born on 16 November 1724 in Alt-Eckendorf. On 18 March 1750 she arrived in Herrnhaag in Hesse where she entered the community of the Moravian Church founded by Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Then after stops in Holland and England, she arrived on 25 November 1752 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania via New York. After passing through Nazareth, Pennsylvania she returned to Bethlehem where she founded a family with Johann Krause.Katherine M. Faull, Moravian Woman's Memoires, Their related Lives, 1750-1820, Syracuse, New-York, USA, Syracuse University Press, 1997, 166 pages, , passage 101, Autobiography of Catharina Krause n√©e Ruch, translated from German to English Another of these migrants was Johannes Adam Mattern born 14 March 1700 at Eckendorf. After being having his case dismissed in 1730 by the court of the Sovereign Council of Colmar on a tax surplus of 118 florins, he moved to Ingwiller where he married. On 16 and 21 July 1751 his property situated in this locality was seized and sold at auction after his flight to America. He arrived at the port of Philadelphia on 16 September 1751 from the ship Edinburgh and was required, with twenty members of his family, to swear allegiance to the British king.Pennsylvania German Pioneers In 1782, 45% of farmland extent was the property of the villagers. This represented an area of 930 acres out of a total of 2,072 acres.Etienne Juillard, Rural Life in Basse-Alsace, Strasbourg, Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1992, 585 pages, , passage 510, Appendix For the collection of the tax of 4% of the produce, five farmers were taxed for operations from 30 to 35 hectares, two from 20 to 30 hectares, five from 10 to 20 hectares and eleven for 2-5 hectares.Etienne Juillard, Rural Life in Basse-Alsace, Strasbourg, Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1992, 585 pages, , passage 518, Appendix For 1789 there is a record of the work. This paper identifies three categories of farmers: those who can make available a horse-drawn carriage to the authorities, those who may have an ox-cart, and those who have only themselves. For Alteckendorf, seven farmers had six or more horses, two had five, four had four, and one had three. Eighteen farmers had two cows. In addition, there were 73 labourers available for work.Etienne Juillard, Rural Life in Basse-Alsace, Strasbourg, Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1992, 585 pages, , page 517, source: document E3224 in the Departmental Archives of Bas-Rhin As twelve farmers are taxed for from 10 to 35 hectares and fourteen farmers had from 4 to 10 horses, it is reasonable to assume that the farmer who owned three horses operated at least 10 hectares. During the Revolution Pastor Jakob Christian Roehrich was posted to Alteckendorf from 1795 to 1802 and left in the parish archives a testament about the period of the Terror.p. 29, 149, 159. \\"In our time the most violent persecutions prevailed against worship and ministers of religion. Under the threat of incurring heavy prison sentences and even the death penalty, it was forbidden for the clergy to perform any religious act whatsoever. It was equally forbidden to baptize, to celebrate a wedding to attend the dead, or to bring words of comfort to the sick. Euloge Schneider and his companions, the representatives of a blood thirsty government, were willing to consider any intervention by clergy as an act of hostility to the state or as a Counter- revolutionary crime falling under the threat of intervention by the guillotine that was paraded across the country. Under the government of Robespierre all objects of worship, vases and vestments were removed and the clergy were imprisoned on the basis of the decree of the 1st Thermidor of Year II. This persecution continued even after the fall of Robespierre and until the decree of 3 Vent√¥se in the Year III which granted the free exercise of all religions. The most difficult times of persecution had lasted so long that a whole year passed before parish life could resume. My predecessor, Michael Mehl, died a year ago on the 3 Vent√¥se in Year II. I, Jakob Christian Roehrich from Strasbourg was elected master of religion for this parish and accepted the post on 14 Germinal of the Year III (3 April 1795). I continued to record baptisms, deaths, marriages, and confirmations in the parish register. I also tried to complete the record for the years of persecution when it was forbidden to record. So I tried as much as possible to list all clandestine marriages and baptisms by midwives or other citizens.\\" In the autumn of 1799, a report on the state of public opinion indicated that for the canton of Hochfelden, \\"except for some communes: Alteckendorf Duntzenheim Wickersheim Waltenheim, Wilshausen Hohfrankenheim, Ingenheim, and Melsheim all others comprising the arrondissement are havens for rebel priests, emigrants, deserters, and other bitter enemies of the Republic\\".The Great Exodus of December 1793, Rodolphe Reuss, Librairie Istra, 1924. Page 270. Alteckendorf during the 19th and 20th centuries Population growth (1793-1836) Between 1793 and 1836, like other village communities of the plain of Alsace, Alteckendorf saw its population increase sharply. During these forty-three years, the population grew from 531 inhabitants in 1793 to 777 inhabitants in 1836. An increase of 31.66%. Then from 1836 to 1901 the population of Alteckendorf stabilised. The average population during the second period was 750 people. The lowest was reached in 1856 with 712 inhabitants and the highest in 1901 with 786 inhabitants.Figures from the Cassini website cassini.ehees The Alsatian agricultural world in crisis (1850-1950) The 1850s marked the beginning of a long crisis latent in the Alsatian agricultural world. According to geographer Etienne Juillard,√âtienne Juillard, Rural Life in Basse-Alsace, reprinted 1992, PUS. the Alsatian countryside was not able to adapt to the industrial revolution and the urban explosion which followed. Agricultural and social structures inherited from 18th century prosperity were not able to modernize and compete with other French or European regions more responsive to the needs of the time. Alsatian rural areas then froze and remained characterized by the smallness of its farms, the smallness of its cultivated land, and a rural population attached to the land and its obsolete productive methods. This inability of rural Alsace to adapt to a new more competitive economic environment was accompanied by a rural exodus which continued until the end of the Second World War. Nevertheless, the Alsatian villages retained high population densities (between 75 and 150 people per square kilometre). While the neighbouring villages such Minversheim, Ettendorf, and Buswiller experienced a steady decline in population between 1831 and 1954, Alteckendorf was in a little better demographic situation. Until 1901 the population did not decrease at all but stabilised. The demographic crisis only occurred during the first fifty years of the 20th century. Between 1901 and 1954, the population dropped 23.28% from 786 inhabitants in 1901 to 603 in 1954. Even at the height of the exodus, however, Alteckendorf remained densely populated with 105 inhabitants per square kilometre. The Finitzer family of Alteckendorf circa 1915 Another sign of this crisis in the Alsatian agricultural world was the departure of the rural population to the New World. This migration preoccupied the French royal and imperial authorities. Religious officials were charged with taking an inventory on these departures out of France. In 1856 there was a notice in the baptismal register that said that since 1828, for Alteckendorf, nearly a hundred people went to the Americas. During the 19th century the village community remained very homogeneous from a religious point of view. In 1861 734 people consisted of 725 Lutherans, 3 Catholics, and 6 dissidents. Five years later, in 1866, of 760 people surveyed, 748 were Protestants and the remaining 12 were sectarian. People counted as dissidents or sectarian were probably members of the Fr√∂hlichianer religious movement, a new Anabaptist religion introduced in Alteckendorf by Sophie Abert, the daughter of the local Lutheran pastor from 1802 to 1841: Friedrich Christian Schneider.These descriptions and facts about Alteckendorf can be found in the dictionary Alsace Ancient and Modern in the 1864 edition Philippe Auguste Kroh, a Lutheran pastor who served from 1855 to 1886, in one of his reports indicated that Alteckendorf was primarily an agricultural town. Few could properly be called poor; some relief funds are distributed to well-off people, the welfare office combines a portion of its revenue. Four cabarets in a commune of 760 souls do not promote morality nor economy among the youth. The end of the agricultural world The first decade of the 20th century for Alteckendorf marked the height of its population. In 1901, the village was inhabited by 786 people. This figure is a maximum that will never be reached again. In 1907 there were 156 farms with ten having an area less than half a hectare. Forty- eight farms with areas from a half to 2 hectares, 60 from 2 to 5 hectares, and thirty-eight from 5 to 20 hectares. These figures show the preponderance of small farms. In the 1950s, to maintain a modest income, these farms are operated as polycultures. Within one farm diversification is extreme: a handful of breeding calves and piglets, daily sales from a few litres of milk to the cooperative, crops of tobacco, sugar beet, cereals, and potatoes, for harvest. In 1989 there were only 26 farms, three of which had an area of less than 5 hectares. 7 farms have areas from 4 to 10 hectares, 7 from 10 to 20 hectares, 6 from 20 to 40 hectares and 3 over 40 hectares. In 2006, only 2.2% of workers in Alteckendorf were still engaged in agriculture. The World Wars At the outbreak of World War I Alsace-Lorraine had been German since the Treaty of Frankfurt in 1871. Between 1914 and 1918, 166 Alteckendorfois young men were conscripted into the army of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Nineteen of them were killed or missing. Eight soldiers were killed on the Russian front, one in Morocco and nine on the French front. On 10 December 1919, after the return of Alsace to France, the B√ºrgermeister (Mayor) of Alteckendorf Johann Richert, who had been in office since 1893, resigned because he did not speak French. His successor, Mayor George Luke Richert remained in office until 1940. In that year, he was deposed by the occupying Nazi authorities. He was replaced until the end of the war by Michael Fuchs. In 1940, two Alteckendorfois fighting in French uniform were killed in the fighting against the Germans, one near Seltz and one near Rennes. On 25 August 1942, when Alsace was not officially German, the Nazis, who had controlled the region since 1940, mandated the enlistment of young Alsatians into the Wehrmacht. Sixty-eight young Alteckendorfoises were conscripted and forty-three of them were sent to the Russian front. Twenty of these Malgr√©-nous were killed. From the point of view of fighting in Alteckendorf, there were two air incidents in 1944. On 21 September 1944 a German train was attacked and bombed near the station by allied aircraft. Ten Germans were injured and three were killed. A week later on 28 September 1944 there was a dogfight in the sky above Alteckendorf at low altitude. Three aircraft crashed to the ground at Hochfelden, Issenhausen, and Obermodern and a villager was shot and wounded in the thigh. On 24 November 1944, the village was liberated by U.S. ground forces. The council set up by the Nazis was dissolved and the Francophile Mayor George Richert Luke remained in office until his death, at the age of 65 on 2 November 1949. Heraldry The municipality does not use the simplified official crest and decided to keep the old version so the new one was never used. During part of the 20th century the city used a shield showing an apple upside down which was abandoned in the 1980s. Administration Canton and intercommunality Alteckendorf is one of 29 communes in the canton of Hochfelden. Its general counsel since the partial cantonal elections of 8 and 15 November 2009 is Marie-Paule Lehmann (UMP), Mayor of Scherlenheim. The town is part of the community of communes of Pays de la Zorn which includes 26 of the 29 communes in the canton. This grouping is headed by Bernard Ingwiller (UMP), Mayor of Grassendorf.

From the 21st century, a census of municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 , the so-called \\"law of local democracy\\" and in particular Title V \\"census operations\\" which allow, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is taken into account at the end of the period of five years.

The village passed to Lutheranism in 1545 as did all the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg but the first pastor was not appointed until in 1547. Since the 1970s, the dominance of Lutheranism has been diluted with the arrival of new Catholic residents and the creation of a new Evangelical Free Church. ;The Lutheran parish With churches available, there are services every second Sunday in Altdorf alternating with Eckendorf. The rectory is located at the rear of the church in Eckendorf. The Lutheran parish of Alteckendorf is part of the Consistory of Schwindratzheim and depends on inspections from Bouxwiller. It is a member of the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine (EPCAAL) with about 200,000 members, 235 parishes and 260 pastors (25% women and 75% men). Like all ancient religious communities in Alsace and Moselle, the EPCAAL lives under the Organic Articles, which were promulgated by Napoleon I in 1802. Pastors are treated as civil servants, they are appointed and paid by the State.Wiki Protestants ;The Evangelical Church of Alteckendorf The origin of this young church dates back to 1965 when the Swiss Nicolas Kessely began a work of evangelization among young people in the region. Five years later, he moved to Alteckendorf. From there, he organized parties in various places in the area, where dozens of young people gather to study the Bible, pray, and share with others their religious experiences. In 1974, to meet the spiritual longing of believers, it was decided to form a church: \\"The evangelical church of Alteckendorf\\" was created. In 1980, the Church was registered as a religious association and adhered to the Evangelical Federation of France. Then in 1983, an Alteckendorf barn is transformed into a space for meetings. Ten years later, the premises had become too small and a new worship hall was built in 1994.

Aboriginal significance The island was of cultural importance to the Ngaluma Aboriginal tribe, who called it Warmalana.Tindale, N.B.: Aboriginal Tribes of Australia ‚Äì Ngaluma (WA) , South Australian Museum, 1974. According to Ngaluma legend, the island was formed during the Dreaming when Matalga, a leading Pilbara spirit man, lifted a large rock and threw it into the sea. The rocks and boulders of the island are covered with Aboriginal engravings and rock art. European exploration The island was charted in July 1801 by Fran√ßois-Michel Ronsard, the cartographer on a French expedition led by explorer Nicolas Baudin on board the ship Le G√©ographe. The island was named Ile Depuch after Louis Depuch, a mineralogist on Baudin's expedition. After a visit to the island, Ronsard established that it was volcanic, and was the first evidence of volcanic activity on the Australian continent the expedition had discovered.Chart of Depuch Island , Freycinet Collection, State Library of Western Australia. In 1912, a Norwegian steel sailing ship, the Crown of England, was shipwrecked as it lay anchored on the island loading copper ore, after the area was struck by a cyclone. Many other ships were sunk in the area, such as the passenger liner .Wreck Finder ‚Äì Koombana , Western Australian Museum, 2003. The newly built tug sailing for Fremantle was despatched to rescue the barque Concordia which was left grounded by the storm. Recent activity The discovery of iron ore deposits in the Pilbara region during the early 1960s saw Depuch Island considered for use as a port for the mining facilities being established in the area. In 1962, however, a survey by the Western Australian Museum discovered thousands of Aboriginal engravings, and the port was moved to the Dampier Archipelago.Archaeology and rock art in the Dampier Archipelago ‚Äì Industrial development and archaeological investigation, National Trust of Australia.

The red-billed buffalo weaver is differentiated from the white-billed buffalo weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) by the color of its bill. The feathers of the male are dark chocolate brown in color. The front wing edges and the wing tips are flecked with white. His bill is a shade of red. The eyes are brown and the feet are reddish brown. The female's body is also colored dark chocolate brown, without the white flecks on the wings. However, her chin and throat feathers include broad white colored hems. Her eyes are dark brown and her legs light brown. Adolescent birds are a lighter shade of brown.Fry et al., p. 52 Feeding and foraging The diet of the red billed buffalo weaver consists primarily of insects, seed and fruit. Particular insects the bird feeds on include crickets, locusts, grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetles, weevils, wasps, bees, ants, flies, and spiders. Its diet also includes scorpions. Most of these food sources are located in the soil or in low vegetation. As a result, the red-billed buffalo weaver does most of its foraging on the ground. Climate changes have not significantly affected the abundance of prey for the bird. Habit, habitats, and microhabitats These birds tend to live in dry savannahs and sparse woodlands. They prefer areas usually disturbed by humans and livestock. In fact, if people living in community with a population of red-billed buffalo weavers leave, the birds often depart as well. Thus as places continue to be urbanized, these birds find more homes. Additionally, overpopulation does not tend to be a problem for the red-billed buffalo weaver seeing as they live in colonies. Behavior and social organization The red-billed buffalo weaver has been observed in small family groups or in large flocks. Males tend to be polygamous and control anywhere from one to eight nest chambers with three females. Typically there is one dominant male who controls the most chambers and the most females. The males in lower social positions control fewer chambers and fewer females. These males will defend their chambers and females by showing aggressive displays and giving loud calls. However, two males sometimes cooperate with each other to build the nest, defend their territory, and help feed the chicks. Females do not tolerate other females in their chambers while they are nesting and laying their eggs. Females typically feed the chicks (unless they are part of a cooperative breeding colony). The diet consists of insects, seeds, and fruit found near the nest. Reproduction and breeding baobab in northern Tanzania Red-billed buffalo weavers breed in colonies. The nests are composed of an enormous mass of thorny twigs. These twigs are divided into separate lodges (compartments), each with multiple egg chambers. Each chamber has a smaller nest, typically built by the female (unless they are part of a cooperative breeding colony). The smaller nest is composed of grass, leaves, and roots. The whole nest is usually found in a thorny tree or in a windmill near areas inhabited by humans. When humans leave particular areas, so do the red-billed buffalo weavers living in the same area. White-backed vultures and bateleurs tend to construct their nests above red-billed buffalo weaver nests, which is helpful in camouflaging their nests from predators. Male red-billed buffalo weavers possess a pseudo-penis around 1.5 cm long. It was first reported in an 1831 German anatomist's report on the birds and subsequent research has shown that it is female selected. The pseudo-penis has no blood vessels and does not carry sperm but instead appears to be favored by the females for pleasure and aids males in attracting females; males in colonies have larger pseudo-penises than males which live alone, suggesting male-male competition has also favored the growth of this peculiar organ. Egg laying season can last from September to June, with the peak occurring between December and March. Females lay anywhere from 2 to 4 eggs and incubate them for roughly 14 days. The females are the only ones that tend to the eggs during this period. After 20 to 23 days, the birds leave the nest. Conservation status and threats The red-billed buffalo weaver is currently listed as a least concern (LC) on the IUCN status. While the global population of this species has not been estimated, this bird is considered common and the population is stable. There are currently no programs or organizations established to monitor and maintain the LC status of the bird. Predators of the red-billed buffalo weaver include hawks, eagles, snakes, and baboons. They prey on both adult and adolescent birds. References * Fry, C. Hilary and Keith, Stuart: The Birds of Africa ‚Äì Volume VII., Christopher Helm, London. 2004.

Ordonez was not a full-time professional musician. Most of his working life was spent in the employment of the Lower Austrian Regional Court and his musical activities were pursued in his spare time. Ordonez's choice of career was probably dictated by his social rank. As a member of the nobility, albeit of the lowest rank, he would have been aware that a professional musical career would not have befitted a man of his social standing. Nothing has come to light concerning his general education. However, as a member of the lower classes of the nobility, he may have attended a Ritterakademie, a boarding school for the nobility, and considering his legal career, may have gone on to study law at the University of Vienna in preparation for entry to the civil service. Of his musical training we also known nothing although from his contemporary reputation as a violinist it can be inferred that he received lessons from an early age. Ordonez's professional activities included membership of two prestigious performing bodies: the k.k. Hofund Kammermusik (where he was employed as a Kammermusikus) and the Tonk√ºnstler-Societ√§t in which he was active both as a violinist and as a composer. Ordonez was an early member of the Tonkuenstler-Societaet, an organization devoted to raising money through public concerts for the widows and orphans of musicians, and maintained a close association from 1771, the year of its foundation, until 1784. Ordonez also performed regularly in the houses of the nobility. Dr Charles Burney heard him play at a musical dinner party in 1772 held in the residence of the British Ambassador in Vienna, Lord Stormont: > Between the vocal parts of this delightful concert, we had some exquisite > quartets, by Haydn, executed in the utmost perfection; the first violin by > M. Startzler (J. Starzer), who played the Adagios with uncommon feeling and > expression; the second violin by M. Ordonetz; Count Bruehl played the tenor, > and M. Weigel (F.J. Weigl), an excellent performer on the violoncello, the > base. All who had any share in this concert, finding the company attentive, > and in a disposition to be pleased, were animated to that true pitch of > enthusiasm, which, from the ardour of the fire within them, is communicated > to others, and sets all around in a blaze; so that the contention between > the performers and hearers, was only who should please, and who should > applaud the most! Ill health forced Ordonez to resign both his professional playing appointments in 1783. The same year he was forced to retire on half-salary from his position with the Lower Austrian Land Court, a circumstance which caused him great financial distress. The last three years of Ordonez's life were spent in sickness and poverty. At the time of his death from pulmonary tuberculosis, Ordonez was living a hand-to-mouth existence in shared lodgings. He possessed only a few items of clothing and his total estate, including outstanding pension payments, was valued at less than the cost of his funeral. The outstanding balance was paid by his son-in-law, Joseph Niedlinger, a minor government official in the Upper Building Management Division of the court. For a part-time composer Ordonez was a surprisingly prolific. In addition to his two operatic works - a marionette opera, Musica della Parodie d'Alceste and a Singspiel, Diesmal hat der Mann den Willen - Ordonez is known to have composed a significant amount of church music (now lost), a secular cantata, 73 symphonies, a violin concerto and a large corpus of chamber music of which the 27 authenticated string quartets are of particular importance. Ordonez's sophisticated experiments with cyclic unity and his liking for contrapuntal textures gives his much of his music a very distinctive and original quality. His symphonies were widely disseminated in manuscript copies and Abb√© Stadler noted that they \\"received great applause\\". In particular his opus 1 string quartets are credited as containing \\"some of the most sophisticated pre-19th- century techniques of cyclic unification.\\" Less is known about Ordonez' life because a 1927 fire at the Justizpalast probably destroyed many documents that could've been useful to musicologists interested in him.A.

Recruited to Collingwood from Western Australian based Goldfields Football League side Kalgoorlie Railways, Tyson was a half back flanker and made his VFL debut in 1920. He was named club captain in 1924 and despite not making the finals in his first season in charge he led them to Grand Finals in the next two. It was in the 1926 VFL Grand Final that he found himself in significant controversy. Collingwood lost the match to Melbourne by 57 points and Tyson was accused of 'playing dead'. To this day it is unclear whether the allegations hold water but what was known is that the Collingwood committee considered his relaxed and laid back demeanor as inappropriate for a club captain and were possibly looking for an excuse to get rid of him. Disgruntled with the allegations, Tyson received a clearance to move to North Melbourne for the 1927 VFL season. Tyson topped North Melbourne's goal kicking in his first season with the club and subsequently became captain-coach. Tyson came from a leading Western Australian footballing family; his father Charles Snr, also played for Kalgoorlie Railways, as well as fellow Goldfields' club Coolgardie, and Western Australian Football League (WAFL) clubs East Fremantle and Midland Junction.

It is also found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. The red-rumped cacique's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-rumped cacique in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Cayenne in French Guiana. He used the French name Le cassique rouge and the Latin name Cassicus ruber. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-rumped cacique. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Oriolus haemorrhous and cited Brisson's work. The specific name haemorrhous combines the Ancient Greek words haima \\"blood\\" and orrhos \\"rump\\". The red-rumped cacique is now the type species in the genus Cacicus that introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in 1799.

Description The Selva cacique is entirely black except for a distinctive yellow rump and yellow upper-tail coverts. It is a slender long-tailed bird with a total length of about . The beak and irises are bluish-white while the legs are dark. Distribution and habitat The Selva cacique is endemic to eastern Peru where it is found in the regions of Ucayali, Cusco and Madre de Dios, and the adjoining Acre State in northwestern Brazil. It typically inhabits dense riverside vegetation in forested areas near small rivers and streams, in lowland areas and low foothills at elevations between . Ecology The Selva cacique has been little studied but its behaviour is thought to be similar to that of the Ecuadorian cacique (Cacicus sclateri). It may move through the forest alone or in pairs, or it may do so as part of a small group. Six birds were seen bathing and drinking together by one observer. The birds forage through the canopy and have been observed probing into clumps of seedpods, perhaps for insects, while not feeding in nearby fruit-laden trees. Status The lowland rainforest is being steadily reduced in area as it is cleared for agricultural purposes, and this bird's numbers are also thought to be decreasing. It was never a common bird and is becoming more localised, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there may be between 2,500 and 10,000 mature individuals in total, declining by perhaps 50% in three generations.

Description The male Ecuadorian cacique grows to a length of about , with the female being a little smaller. The plumage of both sexes is entirely black, the beak is whitish, long and pointed, and the iris is blue in adults and brown in juveniles. This bird can be distinguished from the otherwise similar solitary cacique (Cacicus solitarius) because that species is larger, has a darker-coloured iris and spends more time in undergrowth and near the ground and less time in trees.

It is a fairly common bird with a very extensive range so the IUCN has rated it as a \\"species of least concern\\". Description The male solitary cacique has a length of about and the female . It differs from all other entirely black birds with dark irises within its range, by having a large white, chisel-shaped, sharply- pointed beak. It could be confused with the Ecuadorian cacique (Cacicus sclateri), but that is smaller and has a restricted range, or the yellow- billed cacique (Amblycercus holosericeus), but that is not found east of the Andes.

Distribution and habitat The solitary cacique has a very wide distribution in Amazonia. Its range extends southwards as far as northern Argentina and Uruguay at altitudes of up to about . It inhabits forests, gallery forests and flooded areas. It is generally found in the mid-storey of the canopy, or the shrubby understorey, often clambering about among dense vines. Ecology The solitary cacique is often found singly or in pairs but does not join flocks of birds. It forages in tangled undergrowth and is acrobatic, sometimes hanging upside-down. At times it visits flowering trees higher in the canopy. Its diet consists of invertebrates and small vertebrates such as tree frogs, and it also consumes fruit and nectar. Breeding takes place between October to January according to location and in Argentina it is thought that two broods are reared.

The trio signed contracts in November 2007, but did not come close to making a first team appearance, and lacked work permits due to Thailand's low world ranking. Consequently, Kiatprawut was sent on loan to Belgian club Club Brugge. At the end of the season Manchester City went to Thailand on a promotional tour, where Kiatprawut made his only appearance for Manchester City, a 3-1 defeat in a friendly match against a Thailand XI. Shortly after the start of the 2008-09 season, Thaksin's controlling stake in Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group.

She was named one of Variety magazine's 10 Directors to Watch in 2009.Cherien Dabis: 'Amreeka' unveils Arab-American life Early life Dabis was born in Omaha, Nebraska. Her father is a physicianArab in America: Cherien Dabis of Palestinian descent, and her mother is from Salt, Jordan. Cherien grew up in a small town in Ohio, and spent many of her summers in Jordan. Cherien's father was a Palestinian refugee, and at the age of eight years, she visited Palestine for the first time. She and her family were held at the Israeli border for 12 hours, and she was strip- searched along with her sisters. This incident would make Cherien understand \\"what it meant to be Palestinian\\". She would not return to Palestine until 20 years later. Back in the U.S, Cherien's hometown was populated predominantly by middle-class families from German backgrounds. When she would come back from trips to the Middle East, she would be asked if there were telephones and cars back in Jordan. As a Palestinian American, Cherien refused to be seen as an outsider, and instead chose to assimilate to the culture she found herself within. However, when the Gulf War commenced in 1990, things changed for her and her family. Her father lost many of his patients, her mother was called an \\"Arab Bitch\\", and her family began receiving death threats. Although Cherien had no brothers, a rumour began that her father's \\"son\\" was fighting in Saddam Hussein's army. It is also at this time that her family was investigated by the Secret Service because of a rumour that claimed her sister had threatened to Kill George H. W. Bush, who was the president at the time. It is following these incidents that Cherien claims she faced an identity crisis, wherein she became aware of the fact that she was an \\"Arab in America\\". These events would go on to influence her desire to create films. She was 14 years old when she realized that no one was accurately portraying the lives of Arabs in America. She saw a great need to change the way in which Arabs were portrayed in the media. Years later, she would take filmmaking at Columbia University.  Education  Dabis received her B.A. with honors in creative writing and communications from the University of Cincinnati2007 Network of Arab-American Professionals: Conference Speakers and Panelists and her M.F.A. in film from Columbia University School of the Arts in 2004.Boston/Palestine Film Festival Career Film Cherien is a self-proclaimed humanist and describes in her words, \\"after years spent working in Washington, D.C., I realized that I could reach more people and affect more change through fiction than politics.\\" She believes the medium is a powerful tool when discussing various issues. She says that because she was raised between the Middle East and the Mid-West, she has a unique perspective, one that she wanted to represent in her films. As a result, her films are somewhat autobiographical, and the influences drawn from her own personal life are quite evident. And so, her films take on themes of immigration, discrimination, cultural assimilation, and family. Her two first feature films complement one another, and as Cherien puts it, the two \\"complete a diptych\\". Amreeka was about being Arab in America, and May in The Summer was about being American in the Middle East. The two films represent the merging, and often clashing, of two separate worlds. Her first short film, Make a Wish, premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and received awards at other festivals. She was a writer with the television series, The L Word from 2006 to 2008. Dabis made her feature film debut with Amreeka which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. The film also opened to critical praise other important venues.Amreeka Official Site: Bios The DVD for Amreeka was released on January 12, 2010Amreeka DVD with Make a Wish. Dabis' second feature film May in the Summer screened at the opening night of the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. Cherien has two upcoming projects. One will reportedly not tie into her middle-eastern roots and will be a comedy of sorts. The other will be in Arabic, and will in fact be set in Palestine.  Amreeka  Amreeka was Cherien's debut feature film and she says it is \\"loosely based on things that happened to us during the first Gulf War\\". It recounts the story of Muna Farah, a Palestinian divorcee, and her son, Fadi. Muna works in the West Bank, and must pick up her son after school every day. In order to get home, they must cross an Israeli Checkpoint where they are harassed. One day, Muna discovers that she has been awarded a green card though the lottery. Fed up with her living situation, she decides to pack up and leave to the U.S with her son. The film is set following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and so the pair have some trouble at customs. After discovering that a cookie box containing her life savings has gone missing at the airport, Muna decides she needs to find a job. However, her many qualifications do not secure her a high paying job, and so she has no choice but to accept a position at white castle. Alongside this hardship, Muna also finds out that her family is facing a great deal of discrimination within the post 9-11 and Iraq War context. Her family receives threats, and her brother-in-law loses patients. Later on, Fadi gets into a fight at school with other children who are influenced by the information they are getting from the media. His classmates even go so far as to come to White Castle, and make scathing remarks to Muna, who ends up hurting herself after slipping on a drink poured by one of the kids. When Fadi is arrested after causing a fight following this incident, his principal Mr. Novatski speaks on his behalf and gets him released. The film ends with Muna inviting Mr. Novatski to dinner, and everyone sings and dances. The story mirrors the harsh reality many immigrants must face.  May in The Summer  May in the Summer was Cherien's second feature film and was shot on location in Jordan, where she spent her own summers. Not only did she write, direct, and produce the film, but this was also her acting debut. The story follows May Brennan, a successful author from New York City who is engaged to Ziad. The two plan to marry in her hometown of Amman. When she does arrive to Jordan, her mother Nadine, a Born-again Christian, vehemently disapproves of the fact that May is planning on marrying a Muslim man. Her younger sisters Dalia and Yasmine are also a handful. Her estranged father Edward also decides to show up and wants to make amends. As her wedding day gets closer, May has to deal with more issues from her past, as she must remember the painful details of her parent's divorce. May in The Summer is a story about the reconciliation of modern and traditional values.  Television  Cherien began her career as a writer on the popular television show The L Word. She has also directed several episodes of Ramy‚ÄòRamy‚Äô: Star Ramy Youssef Explains Everything You Need to Know About His New Hulu Comedy ‚Äî Watch and two episodes of Ozark.  Personal life  Cherien is based in New York City. She is bisexual.  Inspiration  Cherien grew up watching Egyptian movies. Her family had a vast VHS collection of Egyptian films and Cherien describes them as the beginning of her education in film. E.T and The Wizard of Oz are American films that affected her perception of what films could strive to be.

It is endemic to Madagascar. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-tailed vanga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Madagascar. He used the French name La petite pie-griesche de Madagascar and the Latin Lanius Madagascariensis minor.

When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-tailed vanga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Lanius madagascariensis and cited Brisson's work.

It is based on the Ricardian comparative advantage concept. It most commonly refers to an index, called the Balassa index, introduced by B√©la Balassa (1965). In particular, the revealed comparative advantage of country c in product/commodity/good p is defined by: :RCA_{cp} = \\\\frac {E_{cp}/\\\\sum_{p' \\\\in P} E_{cp'}} {\\\\sum_{c'\\\\in C} E_{c'p}/\\\\sum_{c'\\\\in C, p'\\\\in P}E_{c'p'}}, where: {  -  E  Exports -  c, c'  Country index -  C  Set of countries -  p,p'  Commodity index -  P  Set of commodities } That is, the RCA is equal to the proportion of the country's exports that are of the class under consideration, \\\\frac{E_{cp}}{\\\\sum_{p'}E_{cp'}}, divided by the proportion of world exports that are of that class, \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{c'} E_{c'p}}{\\\\sum_{c', p'} E_{c'p'}}. A comparative advantage is \\"revealed\\" if RCA>1. If RCA is less than unity, the country is said to have a comparative disadvantage in the commodity or industry. The concept of revealed comparative advantage is similar to that of economic base theory, which is the same calculation, but considers employment rather than exports. Example: in 2010, soybeans represented 0.35% of world trade with exports of $42 billion. Of this total, Brazil exported nearly $11 billion, and since Brazil's total exports for that year were $140 billion, soybeans accounted for 7.9% of Brazil's exports. Because 7.9/0.35 = 22, Brazil exports 22 times its \\"fair share\\" of soybean exports, and so we can say that Brazil has a high revealed comparative advantage in soybeans.  References  * Balassa, B.

The complex is one of the largest secure civilian government complexes in Europe. The site is owned by Newcastle Estates Partnership and the principal tenants are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The site consists of a large group of office blocks within a secure perimeter. The official name of the site is \\"Benton Park View\\", but it is known best, especially in Newcastle, as \\"The Ministry\\", after its original purpose as the administrative centre for the Ministry of Pensions (later the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance). The site is well served by public transport. The nearest stop on the Tyne and Wear Metro system is Longbenton, which also serves the nearby suburb in North Tyneside (north of the railway line) called 'Longbenton', and a station at Four Lane Ends is located a short distance away. Both stations are served by trains on the Yellow Line service of the Metro and a number of special bus services to bring workers from outlying areas.http://www.nexus.org.uk/bus/timetables Function The principal function of the site was originally to administer the UK‚Äôs system of retirement and widows‚Äô pensions, along with the system of National Insurance that raises contributions from both employers and employees for the purpose of financing those (and other) benefits of the British social welfare system. These functions had been handled in the past by the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS), the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) before transfer of the contributions aspect to HMRC. This remains the main function of the site today, however as the government continues to rationalise its estate other government departments have moved in and will continue to move to the site. The DWP and its various agencies, including the Pension, Disability and Carers Service, Jobcentre Plus and the Health and Safety Executive also have staff based at the site. Current site Early in the twenty-first century the site underwent a complete physical overhaul. All of the original buildings were demolished, replaced by a series of sixteen contemporary structures, built in grey metal and glass. These buildings include a reception building, a business events centre, and two restaurants, and a service building all of which are single-storey (although one of the restaurants has a basement that contains a sports and fitness centre), as well as eleven multi-storey office blocks. The new site is, compared to the old site, remarkable for its extensive car parking areas, landscaping, and uncluttered appearance. The new buildings provide open plan office space with kitchen facilities, showers, shops selling drinks, snacks, and newspapers, and seating areas for both formal and informal meetings. Each of the buildings has a number, and also a name that is associated with a Northumbrian castle. The office blocks are called Bamburgh House, Lindisfarne House, Warkworth House, Chillingham House, Dunstanburgh House, Alnwick House, Norham House, Langley House, Tynemouth House, Belsay House and Prudhoe House. The two restaurants are called the Amble Inn and the Wark Inn. History The site was created with the founding of the UK welfare system in the late 1940s and consisted of a series of 'H Blocks, So named due to their similarity to the letter 'H' when viewed from above. The old site consisted of a number of brick-built, single-storey H-shaped buildings that dated from the 1940s and a number of other buildings that dated from the 1960s, several of which were multi-storey blocks built in the minimalist concrete-and-glass style of the period. The older single-storey blocks were numbered (1-16) and the newer blocks designated by letter (A-D). The ‚ÄòH‚Äô blocks are believed to have been built as a hospital accommodation for wounded servicemen from World War II, although the buildings were never used for this purpose. It is also widely believed that they were built by German prisoners of war and were never intended for long-term use. These buildings were considered suitable as office space and were to remain in service for fifty years. Over the next few decades, the site grew as a major source of employment in the north-east of England, particularly on Tyneside. During the 1970s, the site employed approximately 10,000 staff, and contained banks, a post office, a gentlemen‚Äôs hairdresser manned by John Compton, a garden shop, and a staff canteen with licensed bar. Special bus transport was provided for staff that travelled to and from many locations in the area. The number of staff employed on the site steadily declined over the 1980s and 1990s, and most of the amenities listed above closed as clerical functions came to be performed by computers and personnel were decanted to other sites, notably the Tyneview Park site, which is located a kilometre or so east of Benton Park View, and to sites at the Cobalt Business Park, situated between North Shields and Shiremoor. The physical deterioration of the buildings had become increasingly evident, and so it was decided to construct the new buildings while demolishing the old, moving staff appropriately. The only remaining remnant of the old site is the George VI plinth, a small stone plinth named after the monarch who opened the site, that once formed the base of the flagpole at the entrance to the old site. The plinth now stands at the centre of a small outside seating area at the rear (or western) end of the site.

The headquarters of Sattari taluka is Valpoi (‡§µ‡§æ‡§≥‡§™‡§à) municipal council. It lies in the north-eastern region of Goa where it is known for its greenery and dense forest. Part of the Western Ghats forms the eastern part of the Sattari taluka. The Mandovi River (popularly known as Mhadei in Sattari taluka) is considered to be the lifeline of Sattari. It has a geographical area of 490 km2; the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary covers 208 km2 of this area. Rural Goa Sattari is part of interior rural Goa. Some of the recent news that emerged from there includes cyclonic winds hitting part of the region in mid-October 2018, farmers protesting land ownership issues, protests over electricity issues and potholes in the roads, among others. Seventy villages Sattari is believed to comprise 70 villages, as suggested by its name, which is believed to be a derivative from the Konkani word 'seventy'. Among these are: * Brahmacarmali, which is directly related to Karmali or Carambolim, connected with the migration of the deity of Lord Brahma and the only home in Goa of a Brahmadeva temple in Goa. (Brahma temples are considered rare. * Dhave/‡§ß‡§æ‡§µ‡•á is a village which was connected by the first Kadamba state-run bus service to Panjim, GDX-001, when it was started in 1980. * Hedoda/Nadoda.

Ambede is a village of veteran litterateur, researcher and scholar Pandit MahadevShastri Joshi who wrote an entire Indian cultural encyclopaedia on his own. He is known to have lost a huge amount of his written literature in Panshet dam tragedy in Pune in the 1960s. * Thane is a village which claims the legacy of the then mighty revenue officers holding the office of the Desai in the Portuguese and pre-Portuguese eras. * Valpoi is the capital of this sub-district or taluka. It is believed that the name Valpoi derived from the phrase vhal poi/ ‡§µ‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§≥ ‡§™‡§≥‡§Ø/ meaning, see the rivulet. Valpoi is the main town of Sattari and hub of merchants and the Muslim community settled there. * Dabose It is a small hamlet of Veluz village falling under Valpoi Municipality area covering ward number 1 with voters population slightly crossing 800. It is situated on the bank of Mhadei river. Villages surrounding dabos are Massordem, Kudcem & Velguem. Dabos has PWD water purification plant which caters the drinking water needs of Sattari Taluka. The village has highly educated youth which are working around the corners of Goa.

The village has a temple of godes Mahalaxmi and every Friday village gather and perform weekly Bhajan and aarties. Most of people are engaged in agriculture and enjoy their day today agricultural products. * Masorde probably has its name derived from the domestic animal, mhais/‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡•à‡§∏/buffalo. * Redeghati is not a village but a famous or infamous location for paranormal activities that are believed to be taking place after sunset. Its name derived from presence of bison in large numbers. * Honda is not to be confused with the Japanese company of the same name. Like Ponda/‡§´‡•ã‡§Ç‡§°‡§æ in Goa, which is probably derived from ‡§´‡•ã‡§Ç‡§°/pit, similarly Honda means Hond/‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§°/pit. * Pissurlem/‡§™‡§ø‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§≤‡•á is one of the prominent mining villages in Goa, Pissurlem was home of famous Maratha warrior Deepajirao Rane. The second family of the Ranes traces its Goa roots here. * Kerim/Keri/‡§ï‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä. A village which shares its name with two other Keri villages in Goa, this village has been a spectator to the development of Rane family in the world of politics from Keri to Sanquelim. Satroji Rane Sardesai was the founder of Rane family in Goa. The village is also famous for the temple of the guardian god, Shree Ajoba. The Rane's first family belongs here. * Poriem/Parye/‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á* Another village from Sattari. * Advoi. Home of Dada Rane, one of the Ranes who revolted against the Portuguese. The Rane's third family belongs to this place. * Gawane. A village settled closed to Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary. Its name is derived from the animal Gawa/ ‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ/ Bison. Gawane is a village densely covered with reserved forest. *Shelop and Shelop Khurd. These twin villages are a part and neighbours to dense reserved forest. The name Shelop might have derived from Sanskrit word ‡§∂‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ. *Morley and morlem colony. Morlem/ ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§≤‡•á is a village neighbouring Parye and Kerim whereas morlem colony is a rehabilitated area of Anjunem Dam victims including villagers of Anjunem/ ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Å‡§£‡•á,Ponsuli/‡§™‡§£‡§∏‡•Å‡§≤‡•á,Gullem/‡§ó‡•Å‡§≥‡•ç‡§≥‡•á and Kelavade/‡§ï‡•á‡§≥‡§æ‡§µ‡§°‡•á. * Vagheri.Vagheri/ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ò‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä is a third highest peak in the sub -district of Satari in North Goa in the state of Goa, trailed by Sosogad/Sonsogor/ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§∏‡•ã‡§ó‡§° which stands first and Kantalanchi Molli/ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§≥‡•Ä being second. * Bhirondem has been called \\"the 20th century village of settlers\\". It has around 500 voters, including 333 voters, and is one of the smallest villages of Goa. Isidore Domnick Mendis writes that the village, according to its chroniclers, had hardly any human residents and the Portuguese government settled many Goans in the village. Most settlers came from other parts of Goa such as \\"Pernem, Arpora, Mapusa, Merces, Loutolim, Poriem, Usgao and Khandepar.\\" Bhirondem is known for the academic branch of prominent institute in Goa, \\"Pilar Fathers\\"; a well developed and maintained farm is a tourist attraction in this village.

It is substantially surrounded by River Clare, which flows into the Corrib. Adjacent villages are Kilmore, Sylane, and Killaloonty. Location Cloonfush is accessed via the main N17 at Clashroe, and is a cul-de-sac single-lane road. The village of Kilmore is reached first, then Cloonfush approx. 1 km later. There is no separation between the two villages today, as houses now line the road almost over its complete length through both villages. The road leading through the village was finally surfaced in the 1950s, with the last 400m remaining with a grass strip in the middle until the early 1980s. There is a peat bog to the south of the village, used predominantly by the inhabitants of both Cloonfush and Kilmore for harvesting turf, which is used as a solid fuel for domestic heating. Facilities Cloonfush does not have any church, shops, schools or other infrastructural amenities. The inhabitants are therefore dependent on the neighbouring town of Tuam and the city of Galway for these services. Until the late 1960s, there was no mains water supply to the village, with each household dependent on obtaining water from the hand water pump located in the village. A local committee was formed and a borehole was sunk near the old hand pump location. A pump house was erected over the borehole. A network of pipes was laid in trenches along the roadside and each house in turn connected. Once commissioned, this system provided fresh clean water to the villages of Kilmore & Cloonfush for almost four decades. Regular independent analysis of the water confirmed its potability. In the early 2000s, the pump house and pipe work were finally abandoned when the network was connected to the mains water supply by Galway County Council. Various travelling shops served the area over the years. The last such service ceased in the late 1970s. History Cloonfush was the location of an abbey, where St.Jarlath was abbot, the ruins of which still exist to this day, some 1,600 years later. The adjacent graveyard (cemetery) is still in use, and since the year 2000 is the location of an annual Mass on the feast day of St. Jarlath (6 June). Cloonfush also features in Griffith's Valuation (Tuam Area) of 1848‚Äì1864.

The Round 1 projects were intended to act as testbeds; building the UK's understanding of offshore wind, whilst in total also providing well over 1000 MW of green generating capacity for the UK. All of the Round 1 offshore wind farms were limited to a maximum area of , and no more than 30 wind turbines. Output The first electricity was supplied by the site on 15 July 2009. The project consists of 25 Siemens Wind Power SWT-107-3.6 wind turbines, each rated at 3.6 MW capacity. This gives the project a maximum output of 90 MW; a third greater than the neighbouring North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm, but with 5 fewer wind turbines and spread over a smaller area. At the time of installation, Rhyl Flats is expected to generate enough electricity to power 60,000 homes on average.

History Communicorp Group Ltd was formed by Denis O'Brien in 1989. It launched its radio operations in Ireland that same year and entered the Czech Republic in 1992. It later added stations in Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland and Hungary. Based in Dublin, the company now owns radio stations including Ireland's Newstalk, Today FM, 98FM, SPIN 1038 and SPIN South West. O'Brien owns both of Ireland's independent (non-state- operated) national radio stations. O'Brien's Communicorp was the highest bidder for Emap's Irish operations when that company decided to sell its radio stations, buying FM104, Highland Radio and Today FM on 14 July 2007. In October 2007, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) approved Communicorp's proposed takeover of Today FM and Highland Radio, but not FM104. The deal was completed by January 2008. Due to a Competition Authority decision, Communicorp was required to sell-on FM104, which it did (to UTV Media) immediately upon its acquisition. O'Brien offloaded Highland Radio in mid-2008. On 21 July 2008, a joint bid from Boxer TV Access and Communicorp, supported by BT Ireland, were successful in obtaining three digital terrestrial television multiplex contracts from the BCI. Boxer DTT Limited withdrew from its agreement to provide a DTT platform on 20 April 2009.

The stations were required to be sold off by the Competition Commission following Global's acquisition of GMG Radio in 2012. The formation of Communicorp UK on 1 April 2014, headquartered in Manchester, allowed Communicorp UK to be operated as a standalone entity. The Bulgarian stations were sold in 2018.

It spent four weeks as a New York Times Bestseller.   Plot summary After terrorists bomb the Israeli embassy in Rome, agents at Israel‚Äôs intelligence service ‚Äîbetter known as the Office‚Äî struggle to determine a precise motive for the attack. The investigation uncovers a CD filled with highly sensitive information about Gabriel Allon, a legendary hit man for the Office. No longer safe outside of Israel, Gabriel returns reluctantly to his homeland with Italian girlfriend and fellow Office agent Chiara Zolli. Lev, the current director of the Office, has long resented Gabriel's close ties to Ari Shamron, former director of the Office, as well as his recent clandestine work for Shamron. Lev demands that Gabriel officially rejoin the Office so he can benefit from the protection of other agents. However, Gabriel and Shamron also recognize that Lev seeks to control and curtail their secret operations. Lev instructs Gabriel to remain in Israel and assigns him a research team to investigate the bombing and its link to Gabriel. Thus, Yossi, Dina, Yaakov, and Rimona come under Gabriel's direction. Dina connects a series of seemingly random terrorist attacks and attributes them to Khaled al-Khalifa, a mysterious descendant of Palestinian warlords. Indeed, Dina points out, Shamron and Gabriel each led operations against Khaled's relatives. Though adopted by Yasser Arafat as a child, Khaled grew up abroad and never became a visible force within the PLO. Dina proposes that, hidden behind a carefully constructed European identity, Khaled has masterminded brutal attacks against Israel, including the recent embassy bombing. In fact, all of the attacks seem to commemorate the murders of Palestinians, including Khaled's father and organizer of Black September, Sabri al-Khalifa. Dina suggests that another attack is imminent: she anticipates an act of terror to commemorate the Israeli razing of Beit Sayeed, the hometown of Khaled's Palestinian ancestors. Only twenty-eight days remain until the fiftieth anniversary of that event. The reader learns that Khaled lives as a prosperous and renowned French archeologist under the identity of Paul Martineau. He organizes terror attacks through an Arab associate in Marseilles. The reader also discovers that the arrangements for Khaled's next attack are underway. As Gabriel and Chiara settle into a new life in Israel, Ari recommends that Gabriel dissolve his marriage to Leah and marry Chiara. He also presses Gabriel to meet with Yasser Arafat to learn of Khaled's whereabouts. Ari's son Yonatan, a member of the IDF, escorts Gabriel to the Mukataa, Arafat's compound. Although the Israeli and Palestinian traditionally work for opposing ideologies, Arafat consents to the meeting because Gabriel once saved his life. Gabriel sees through Arafat's evasive answers and lies and concludes that Khaled did indeed plan the bombing of the Israeli embassy. Gabriel also learns that Tariq al-Hourani worked for Arafat, and the car bomb that killed his son and maimed Leah was also meant to end his own life. Yaakov later introduced Gabriel to Mahmoud Arwish, a reticent Palestinian informant. Arwish confirms that Khaled contacts Arafat regularly and uses a female collaborator to relay important phone messages. Because the most recent of such phone messages came from Cairo, Gabriel travels to Egypt. There, he meets Mimi Ferrere, a polyglot and social butterfly whose voice matches that of Khaled's collaborator. He bugs her phone, intercepts a message from Khaled, and matches the phone number to Marseilles. Aboard the ship Fidelity, Gabriel meets with his team and Ari Shamron to plan Khaled's murder. However, Khaled anticipates their attack and leads Gabriel into a trap: he must put himself into Khaled's hands or Leah will die; Gabriel abandons his team to save his wife. Khaled's instructions lead Gabriel to the Parisian Gare de Lyon, and Gabriel realizes too late that Khaled plans to bomb the train station and pin the crime on Gabriel and Israeli intelligence. With only seconds to spare, Gabriel kills two of Khaled's three bombers and rescues Leah. They return safely to Israel, but Khaled and Mimi leak photographs of Gabriel to the press that link him to the bombing at Gare de Lyon. Although she still suffers psychiatric trauma, Leah regains a piece of herself and begins to communicate with Gabriel for the first time in thirteen years. Chiara decides to leave Gabriel and returns to Venice. Ultimately, Gabriel locates and kills Khaled at an archeological excavation in southern France. He then returns to Israel and art restoration. Historical Application Although Prince of Fire is fiction, Daniel Silva based some of its characters on real people, including Black September mastermind Ali Hassan Salameh as well as Yasser Arafat, who did in reality adopt Salameh's son after Israeli agents killed Salameh. Yasser Arafat died before the completion of Prince of Fire. International titles Portuguese: Pr√≠ncipe de Fogo. (Prince of Fire). (2006). Sources Silva, Daniel. Prince of Fire. G.P.

Originally, iDE was devoted to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of affordable, scalable micro-irrigation and low- cost water recovery systems throughout the developing world. iDE facilitates local manufacture and distribution of these products through local supply chains that sell to farmers at an affordable price which they can repay in one growing season. This strategy allows farmers to grow higher value and surplus crops, and in turn links them to high-value crop markets where they can realize profits from their higher yields. Recently, their success is in the promotion of sanitation products (simple latrines, ceramic water filters) to decrease the practice of open defecation leading to diarrheal disease. iDE has funding affiliates in the United Kingdom, and Canada. The head office is located in Denver, United States.  Overview  iDE distinguishes its approach from traditional charity models, describing its approach as creating an enabling environment for poor rural households to participate effectively in rural market systems so they may increase their income and begin an upward spiral out of poverty. The organization promotes specific innovations in products, services, or business models as solutions to development problems. Three-quarters of people living in extreme poverty earn their living from small farms, and experience has shown that this market-based approach can help poor rural farmers increase their agricultural productivity, improving incomes, food security, and nutritional outcomes. In water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), iDE helps develop local businesses that supply latrines and water filters to low-income households in a manner that allows for the generation of profit along the supply chain while maintaining a price appropriate for poor households. iDE measures its success as average income gain per household (impact), number of farmers reached (scale) and total additional income generated per dollar (cost effectiveness). For every $1 invested in its projects, iDE customers generate on average $10.50 in additional household income in agriculture and $16.30 in increased savings in WASH.iDE 2015 Annual Report iDE currently operates country programs in Nepal, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Zambia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Nicaragua and Honduras. The organization employs nearly 1,000 total staff worldwide and had budget of $25 million in 2015.iDE 2015 Annual Report With funding from more than 110 donors, including USAID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, SDC, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CIDA, DFID, and the World Bank, iDE has implemented more than 275 projects worldwide. Agriculture development iDE invests in the design and initial promotion of affordable irrigation equipment, such as pumps, drip systems, and water storage, and engages the private sector to sustain the necessary supply chains. iDE also implements integrated value chain development approaches that focus on supporting existing enterprises to supply and market appropriate farm inputs, provides technical and business advice for small producers, and improves smallholder farmers‚Äô market access. iDE developed an innovative business model to provide high-quality agricultural inputs and technical advice to poor farmers through commission-based sales agents known as Farm Business Advisors (FBA). iDE provides support to FBAs through training, bulk purchasing power, credit access, market information, and promotion while ensuring standards for product and service quality are maintained. FBAs then analyze individual farms to identify opportunities and match them with the appropriate inputs. FBAs sell the inputs at a profit and provide technical advice during visits throughout the growing season. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) iDE also pioneered market-based approaches in the WASH sector that incorporate private-sector, NGOs, and government stakeholders. Developing markets for sanitation improves rural sanitation at scale by connecting consumers with products and services that they want and can afford. This approach avoids the use of direct subsidies for hardware or installation, instead creating demand for sanitation products and services by promoting them through innovative means that align with the goals and aspirations of the target market. Sanitation marketing also develops sustainable businesses to supply those products and services to low-income households in a manner that allows for the generation of profit along the supply chain while maintaining a price point appropriate for poor households.  Technology   Treadle pumps  The treadle pump is a foot-powered water pump developed in the 1970s by Norwegian engineer Gunnar Barnes.Polak, Paul. Scientific American. September 2005. Page 84 In the 1980s, iDE initiated a campaign to market the pumps to smallholder farmers. Over the course of 12 years, 1.5 million treadle pumps were purchased, increasing the purchasers' incomes by $150 million annually. The cost of the treadle pump program was $12 million, compared with conventional dam and canal systems which would have cost $1.5 billion to irrigate a similar area.Polak, Paul. Scientific American. September 2005. Page 88 The treadle pump program in India won an Ashden Award in 2006.  Drip irrigation  Although drip irrigation is not a new technology, iDE has made major strides in breaking down the costs of irrigation systems to make them affordable and more usable (i.e., by encouraging manufacturers to sell kits sized for one acre farms) to low-income farmers. Micro-irrigation has enormous potential, as it uses 30%-60% less water than traditional methods, reduces salinization, delivers water directly to the roots of crops, and increases yields by 5%-50%.2006 UNDP Human Development Report, page 197.  Ceramic filters  iDE has also promoted the use of ceramic water filters in countries such as Cambodia. Ceramic water filters can significantly improve household water quality (up to 99.99% reduction in E. coli) and can be manufactured locally and sold for under US$10.Water and Sanitation Program. \\"Use of Ceramic Water Filters in Cambodia.\\" August 2007.  Country programs  iDE has country programs in 3 continents and 11 countries: Asia * Bangladesh * Cambodia * Vietnam * Nepal Africa * Burkina Faso * Ghana * Ethiopia * Mozambique * Zambia Latin America * Honduras * Nicaragua  Impact and awards  As of late 2016, iDE estimates that it has improved incomes for more than 26 million peopleiDE Web site and catalyzed the commercial distribution of some 2.5 million irrigation technologies, which, on average, produce $150 of additional income annually. Over the last five years, iDE has facilitated the sale of 222,000 WASH technologies, benefiting over 1 million people, improving health and saving money previously spent on treatment. The income or savings from these interventions allows families to invest in nutrition, healthcare, education and additional business activities. iDE has received a number of awards, including being named #33 in the NGO Advisor Top 500 World NGOs.TOP 500 World 2016, NGO Advisor (subscription required) (In previous years, iDE was #36 (2015), #36 (2014), #30 (2013), and #75 (2012).)

The VIA Nano was released by VIA Technologies in 2008 after five years of development by its CPU division, Centaur Technology. This new Isaiah 64-bit architecture was designed from scratch, unveiled on 24 January 2008, and launched on May 29, including low-voltage variants and the Nano brand name. The processor supports a number of VIA-specific x86 extensions designed to boost efficiency in low-power appliances.  History  Unlike Intel and AMD, VIA uses two distinct development code names for each of its CPU cores. In this case, the codename 'CN' was used in the United States by Centaur Technology. Biblical names are used as codes by VIA in Taiwan, and Isaiah was the choice for this particular processor and architecture. It is expected that the VIA Isaiah will be twice as fast in integer performance and four times as fast in floating-point performance as the previous-generation VIA Esther at an equivalent clock speed. Power consumption is also expected to be on par with the previous-generation VIA CPUs, with thermal design power ranging from 5 W to 25 W. Being a completely new design, the Isaiah architecture was built with support for features like the x86-64 instruction set and x86 virtualization which were unavailable on its predecessors, the VIA C7 line, while retaining their encryption extensions. Several independent tests showed that the VIA Nano performs better than the single-core Intel Atom across a variety of workloads. In a 2008 Ars Technica test, a VIA Nano gained significant performance in memory subsystem after its CPUID changed to Intel, hinting at the possibility that the benchmark software only checks the CPUID instead of the actual features supported by the CPU to choose a code path. The benchmark software used had been released before the release of VIA Nano. On November 3, 2009, VIA launched the Nano 3000 series. VIA claims that these models can offer a 20% performance boost and 20% more energy efficiency than the Nano 1000 and 2000 series. Benchmarks run by VIA claim that a 1.6 GHz 3000-series Nano can outperform the ageing Intel Atom N270 by about 40‚Äì54%. The 3000 series adds the SSE4 SIMD instruction set extensions, which were first introduced with 45nm revisions of the Intel Core 2 architecture. On November 11, 2011, VIA released the VIA Nano X2 Dual-Core Processor with their first ever dual core pico-itx mainboard. The VIA Nano X2 is built on a 40 nm process and supports the SSE4 SIMD instruction set extensions, critical to modern floating point dependent applications. Via claims 30% higher performance in comparison to Intel's Atom with a 50% higher clock. The Zhaoxin joint venture processors, released from 2014, are based on the VIA Nano series. Features floorplan * x86-64 instruction set * Clock speed from 1 GHz to 2 GHz * Bus speed of 533 MHz or 800 MHz (1066 MHz for Nano x2) * 64 KB data and 64 KB instructions L1 cache and 1 MB L2 cache per core. * 65 nm manufacturing process (40 nm for Nano x2) * Superscalar out-of-order instruction execution * Support for MMX, SSE, SSE2,SSE3, SSSE3, and SSE4 instruction set * Support for x86 virtualization with Intel-compatible implementation (disabled before stepping 3) * Support for ECC memory * Pin-compatible with VIA C7 and VIA Eden Architecture overview die floor-plan Nano X2 microarchitecture. * Out- of-order and superscalar design: Providing much better performance than its predecessor, the VIA C7 processor, which was in-order. This puts the Isaiah architecture in line with same year offerings from AMD and Intel. * Instructions fusion: Allows the processor to combine some instructions as a single instruction, reducing power requirements and giving higher performance (the Atom uses a similar strategy in processing x86 instructions in a more 'whole' manner, rather than breaking them into RISC-like micro-ops). * Improved branch prediction: Uses eight predictors in two pipeline stages. * CPU cache design: An exclusive cache design means that contents of the L1 cache is not duplicated in the L2 cache, providing a larger total cache. * Data prefetch: Incorporating new mechanisms for data-prefetch, including both the loading of a special 64-line cache before loading the L2 cache and a direct load to the L1 cache. ** Fetches 4 x86 instructions per cycle as opposed to Intel's 3-5 ** Issues 3 micro-operations/clock to execution units * Memory access: Merging of smaller stores into larger load data. * Execution units: Seven execution units are available, that allows up to seven micro-ops being executed per clock. ** 2 Integer units (ALU1 and ALU2) *** ALU1 is feature complete, while ALU2 lacks some low usage instructions and therefore is more suited for tasks like address calculations. ** 2 Store units, one for Address Store and one for Data Store according to VIA. ** 1 Load unit ** 2 Media units (MEDIA-A and MEDIA-B) with a 128-bit wide datapath, supporting 4 single precision or 2 double-precision operations.

He played in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers, and California Angels. He coached for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Tigers, and the New York Yankees. Career Minor Leagues As a minor leaguer with the Tulsa Oilers in 1972, Kelleher set an American Association record for shortstops with a .979 fielding percentage. Playing career Perhaps Kelleher's most famous moment as a Major Leaguer came as a Cub in 1977. That August 7, in the second game of a doubleheader against the San Diego Padres at Wrigley Field, Kelleher, at 5‚Äì9 and 170 pounds, responded to Dave Kingman's hard slide into him on a double play attempt (Kingman was apparently angered over being hit by a Steve Renko pitch) by jumping on the 6‚Äì6, 210-pound Kingman's back and pummeling him with blows; the ensuing bench-clearing brawl resulted in the ejections of both players. The two became teammates the following season, after Kingman signed with the Cubs as a free agent. In 11 seasons, Kelleher was an infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals (1972‚Äì73 and 1975), Houston Astros (1974), Chicago Cubs (1976‚Äì80), Detroit Tigers (1981‚Äì82) and California Angels (1982). He was a member of the 1982 AL Western Division Champions, playing mostly shortstop and hitting .163 in 49 at bats. He did not appear in the playoffs. Playing in 622 games, Kelleher recorded a career .213 batting average in 1,081 at bats. He is the most recently retired non-pitcher to have more than 1,000 at-bats and no home runs. Coaching career Kelleher consistently worked in major league baseball after his playing career ended. He was a minor league coach and a scout.

It had traditionally been considered a member of the family Cotingidae. It is endemic to Atlantic forest in south-eastern Brazil. For a long time this species was feared to be extinct, as it went unrecorded during the 20th century until two birds were observed in Serra dos √ìrg√£os on several days in October 1996. Since these sightings, there have not been any confirmed records, although at least one recent‚Äîbut unconfirmed‚Äîrecord exists from near Ubatuba. Consequently, it is considered Critically Endangered by BirdLife International. Taxonomy The kinglet calyptura was initially described as Pardalotus cristatus by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1818 in the Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle on the basis of a specimen collected near Rio de Janeiro. It was later placed in the monotypic genus Calyptura, whose name comes from the Ancient Greek words Œ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÄœÑœâ \\"to cover\\", and ŒøœçœÅŒ¨ \\"tail\\", a reference to the kinglet calyptura's very short tail which hardly projects beyond the species' tail- coverts. The specific name cristata comes from the Latin word \\"cristatus\\" crested. Another common name for the species is Kinglet Cotinga. Description Pardalotus cristatus illustrated by Georges Cuvier When classified as a cotinga, it was the smallest known species of that family. The kinglet calyptura's call has been described as brief, hoarse, and disagreeable, as well as surprisingly loud for a bird of its size. Distribution and habitat Due to the paucity of records for this species, most information about their habitat is circumstantial. It has been hypothesized by BirdLife International that these birds are altitudinal migrants due to their diet. This bird can tolerate secondary forest but it is usually restricted to foothill forest. Ecology and behavior The kinglet calyptura is normally found in pairs. This species forages by climbing in all directions on lianas, eating insects or small berries depending on the season. It has a preference for fruits from the Marianeira, which is the Brazilian name for two different species of shrub in the family Solanaceae, Acnistus cauliflorus and Aureliana lucida. The species has also been observed exploring the rosettes of bromeliad leaves in which dew collects. General information The kinglet calyptura is a bird from South American and known only from specimens dating back to the 19th Century. It was placed in the Cotingidae, but is more closely related to the Platyrinchus and Neopipo. These genera also help make up the Rhynchocyclidae (tody-tyrants and flatbills) and Tyrannidae (typical tyrant flycatchers). Its taxonomic history is almost non existent because there is not much behavioral and anatomical data to study. Habitat loss is most likely to have caused its endangerment, but altitudinal migration and specialization could have also played a role. It seems to inhabit higher and wider places with its main food resource being insects, seeds and berries. Instead of remaining high in the trees, it tends to travel through the shrubberies on the ground. There are also no remnants of its skeleton stored anywhere. It is currently considered an endangered species by the BirdLife International. Threats to environment and recent sightings It is endemic to Atlantic forest in south-eastern Brazil, which has seen heavy rise in deforestation and pollution due to industrialization of the country. From the kinglet calyptura's earliest documentations in the 19th Century and fossil evidence from the early 20th Century, there is no reason to believe that it was not uncommon to encounter the bird in the wild (BirdLife International). For a long time this species was feared to be extinct, with threats to the environment doing little to quell those fears. Projects in the 1970s, including the construction of a bridge connecting the area to Rio de Janeiro, have resulted in high amounts of toxic metals such as lead, zinc and copper in this bird's habitat (Neto, Smith, McAllister). Lambert and Kirwan maintain that the lack of sightings is primarily due to the fact that researchers simply cannot explore high areas of the rainforest because they are inaccessible to humans. Contradicting this is the fact that deforestation in Brazil has led to the displacement of as many as 93% of Atlantic birds situated there (Loiselle, Graham, Goerck, Ribeiro). With those numbers in mind, there is no more reason to speculate that the species may be extinct or may have completely relocated to an unknown location. Sightings of the species have been sporadic, with the last official sighting of the bird in Serra dos Orgaos for several days in October 1996. Since these sightings, there have not been any confirmed records, although at least one recent-but unconfirmed- record exists from near Ubatuba. Consequently, it is considered Critically Endangered.

Together they had four children. Boyle was an elected member of the Albany Municipal Council from 1915 until 1920. He then moved to Toodyay and sat on the Toodyay Shire Council for some years, including two years (1928‚àí1930) as its chairman. He stood for the Legislative Assembly seat of Toodyay in 1924 and 1927, on both occasions losing to fellow Country Party member and minister, John Lindsay. When Lindsay transferred to Mount Marshall, Boyle tried again but was beaten by another Country Party candidate, Lindsay Thorn. He was president of the Wheatgrowers' Union from 1931 to 1935 and chairman of directors of its newsletter, The Wheatgrower. In May 1935, he accepted the Country Party's nomination to contest a by-election for the seat of Avon following the death of Harry Griffiths. He served as the member for Avon until the 1943 election, at which time he was defeated by a 15-vote margin by the Labor candidate William Telfer. He appealed against the result to the Court of Disputed Returns, who ordered a fresh election, but Telfer won by 298 votes at the by-election on 1 June 1944. He stood unsuccessfully for the Senate two years later. Boyle died on 15 June 1960 and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

It is endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands where it is only found on Floreana Island. Its name is derived from the fact that the bird's beak is intermediate in size between that of the small tree finch and the large tree finch. Because it has a very small range on a single island, and because of the introduction of a parasitic fly which kills the nestlings, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the medium tree finch as \\"critically endangered\\". Distribution This species is only found on Floreana Island at elevations above 250 meters in moist highland forest habitats. Prime breeding habitat is dominated by Scalesia pedunculata trees. Ecology The diurnal Galapagos short-eared owl is its only remaining natural predator. Medium tree finches generally lay two to three eggs. Eggs are incubated for approximately 12 days, and nestlings are fed by both parents at the nest for approximately 14 days before becoming fledglings. The range of beak sizes of the medium tree finch on Floreana and the large tree finch, Camarhynchus psittacula, on Isabela is roughly the same. This reflects the fact that the two species feed on the same type and size of insect. The beak of the medium tree finch is intermediate in size between the small tree finch and large tree finch. All three species are found in the same habitat country and area. Status The medium tree finch is threatened by introduced predators such as rats, mice, cats and the smooth-billed ani, as well as habitat loss, which has occurred through clearance for agriculture. The introduced fly Philornis downsi is a significant threat to the survival of this species. Parasitic larvae of this fly live in the nest material and feed on the blood and body tissues of nestlings. P. downsi causes high nestling mortality in the medium tree finch. Because of this, and because it has a very small range on a single island, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the medium tree finch as \\"critically endangered\\".

British Speedway Who's Who. Sullivan achieved a career best third in the 2002 Speedway Grand Prix, winning two of the ten Grand Prix run during the year. Career Australia Juniors Sullivan's family moved from Melbourne to Adelaide in the late 1970s, and as a child Sullivan played Australian Rules Football, but became interested in speedway when it became obvious that he was not of the ideal build to be a league footballer. His parents bought him a junior speedway bike and he had his first ride at the Olympic Park Speedway in Mildura in 1985, although his home track was the Sidewinders Speedway in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield, a 112m long track run by the Sidewinders Junior Speedway Club solely aimed at junior Motorcycle speedway development. Within a few seasons Sullivan was seen as one of the best junior riders in South Australia, winning the South Australian Under-16 Individual title in 1990 and 1991 while winning the Pairs Championships in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991. Sullivan finished in second place at the 1990 Australian Under-16 Championship in Perth behind future Australian team mate and three time World Champion Jason Crump. He would go one better on 12 January 1991 winning his first individual Australian title at his home track in Adelaide. Ryan Sullivan won three Australian Under-16 Pairs Championships, first in 1989 with that year's National Individual Champion Brett Tomkins, and backing that up in 1990 teaming with fellow Adelaide rider Troy Norvil. He won his third and last junior pairs title on 13 January 1991 paired with Brett Woodifield, a week before his 16th birthday at which time he would graduate into the senior ranks. Due to e missed winning the Seniors Sullivan's first senior speedway championship came on 14 April 1991 when he won the track championship at the Westline Speedway in South Australia's \\"steel city\\" Whyalla, just three months after graduating to the senior ranks. Sullivan was unbeaten in the heats to finish on 12 points, 4 clear of meeting favourite Brett Tomkins before going on to win the final from Paul Schevienen and Troy Norvill. After having gained his motor mechanic qualifications at age 19, Sullivan was regarded one of the best young riders in Australia, going on to win three South Australian Championships in succession in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and the Australian Under-21 Championship in 1993 and 1996 (the championship was not held in 1994 or 1995). Other than his 1993 Under-21 title which was won at the Olympic Park Speedway in Mildura, his 1996 U/21 title and his state title wins came at his home track, the North Arm Speedway. As North Arm closed at the end of the 1997 season, Sullivan is the last rider to win the SA Championship at the track. One of the first big wins of Sullivan's career came when he took out Round 4 of the 1996 Australian Speedway Masters Series 500 at the Wayville Showground at home in Adelaide, holding out England's multiple Long Track World Champion Simon Wigg in the final. Sullivan scored his first podium finish in the Australian Championship in 1997 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground when he finished equal second on points with Jason Crump, but lost a run-off to Crump and was credited with third place. He again finished in third place in 2002 at the Wayville Showground. In 2004, Sullivan became the first South Australian rider to win the Australian Championship since John Boulger in 1973 when he won the first year that the championship was run as a series (held over 3 rounds), rather than the single meeting format that had been in place since the first running of the title in 1926. Sullivan was undefeated over the three rounds held at the Gold Coast, Gosford and Olympic Park speedways. He defeated defending champion Leigh Adams who finished 2nd in all three rounds, with 1990 World #3 Todd Wiltshire finishing in third with 2 fourth and 1 third placings. This would prove to be Sullivan's only Australian Championship win and the final time he stood on the podium of the event. England Sullivan has spent most of his British career with the Peterborough Panthers, and although he had not ridden in Britain since 2006, in August 2008 he returned to ride for Peterborough until the end of that season. He has also ridden for the Poole Pirates but returned to the Panthers on a full transfer in 2006. He went on to ride in Sweden (Rospiggarna), Poland (Unibax Torun) and Russia (Togliatti). He returned to Peterborough in 2012 to replace the injured Kenneth Bjerre, but suffered a hand injury which ended his season and led to announcing his retirement from the sport in March 2013.\\"Aussie Star Sullivan Retires \\", speedway365.com, 18 March 2013. Retrieved 19 March 2013 International Sullivan qualified for the 1995 and 1996 Under-21 World Championships. He finished third in 1995 at the Kaanaa Speedway Stadium in Tampere, Finland (won by Jason Crump). Sullivan finished in a 4-way tie on 12 points and defeated Tom√°≈° Topinka (Poland), Kai Laukkanen (Finland) and Ben Howe (England) in a runoff to claim third place. In his final shot at winning the title before turning 22, he improved to second in 1996 behind Poland's Piotr Protasiewicz (who scored a 15-point maximum) at the Speedwaybahn in Olching, Germany. Sullivan defeated Danish rider Jesper B. Jensen in a runoff to finish second in 1996 after both finished the meeting on 11 points. Sullivan's first big international career win came when he defeated triple-Australian Champion Leigh Adams in a runoff to win the 1995 Overseas Final in Coventry, England. Sullivan became the first Australian winner of the Overseas Final which had been in place since 1981. In 1997, Sullivan became the first Australian to win the Intercontinental Final when he led home an Aussie 1-2-3 (with Jason Crump and Craig Boyce) in V√§stervik, Sweden. In both 1997 and 2003, Sullivan won the prestigious Golden Helmet of Pardubice at the Sv√≠tkov Stadion in Pardubice, Poland. In 1999, Sullivan was part of the Australian team that took out the Speedway World Team Cup, Australia's first WTC win since 1976. He was also a member of the team when Australia won the Speedway World Cup in 2001 and 2002. He finished second in the SWC in 2003, third in 2007 and fourth in both 2006 and 2008. Sullivan's last major win came in 2009 at the Alfred Smoczyk Memorial in Leszno, Poland.

Polovtsov has graduated from the Imperial School of Jurisprudence and started his work in the 1st department of the Governing Senate.Alexander Polovtsov article in Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary In 1861 Polovtsov marry Nadezhda Mikhaylovna Yunina (1843‚Äì1908), the only foster daughter of the first Chairman of the State Bank of the Russian Empire, Alexander von Stieglitz. According to popular believes Nadezhda was an illegitimate daughter of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia and an unknown lady-in-waiting K. The marriage brought Polovtsov not only one million rubles of dowry and eventually 16-17 millions of rubles as Stieglitz's inheritance but also the help of the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia who was helping his alleged niece. Since 1871 Polovtsov became a senator, since 1873 he was the Secretary of State and simultaneously the Stats-Secretary of the Emperor Alexander III of Russia. Since 1892 until his death in 1909 he was a member of the State Council. Polovtsov was the initiator of the creation of the Russian Historical Society (created in 1865). He was the Secretary of the society in 1866-1879 and the Chairman of the society from 1879 until his death in 1909. The society commissioned works of such historians as Sergey Solovyov, Nikolay Kostomarov, Vasily Klyuchevsky who set the foundation for the History of Russia. Under Polovtsov the society published 128 volumes of Sborniks of Russian Historical Society. Polovtsov also prepared the 25 volumes of the Russian Biographical Dictionary that played an important role as the source of the biographical data on Russian people. To correctly establish the notability Polovtsov refused to include biographies of living people. Polovtsov (together with his father-in-law Alexander von Stieglitz founded the Stieglitz Museum of Applied Arts.

At Bletchley Park during World War II he made significant contributions both to the breaking of the German Enigma code and headed the section tasked with breaking Japanese Naval codes. Early life and education Foss was born in Kobe, Japan, one of five children of the Rt Revd Hugh Foss, Bishop of Osaka and his wife Janet Ovans. As a child of a missionary family stationed in Japan he developed fluency in Japanese from an early age. Foss was later educated at Marlborough College and graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1924. Foss's elder brother Charles Calveley Foss was awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War. Career as a cryptanalyst In December 1924 he joined the Government Code and Cipher School. He recalled learning of two models of the Enigma machine in 1926: the large non-reciprocal typing B model, and the small index C model. In 1927 Edward Travis gave him a small (reciprocal) machine to examine, and he wrote a paper, \\"The Reciprocal Enigma\\", on solving the non-plugboard Enigma. The small [C Model] Enigma was developed by the German services; the standard World War II British Typex machine was also developed from it. In September 1934 Foss and Oliver Strachey broke the Japanese naval attach√© cipher. In November 1940 he was the first person to break a day's worth of the German Enigma code, deciphering 8 May 1940 by the method of Banburismus. In honour of this feat, 8 May is referred to as \\"Foss's Day\\". At Bletchley Park in World War II, Foss headed the Japanese Naval Section (Hut 7) from 1942 to 1943. In December 1944 he went to Washington and worked with U.S. Navy cryptographers on Japanese ciphers. A sandal-wearer, he was known as \\"Lend-lease Jesus\\". Gordon Welchman was told that Foss was highly esteemed by the Americans, and says that \\"before the war he was one of the most brilliant of the professional cryptographers of the Government Code and Cypher School\\". Foss' paper \\"Reminiscences on Enigma\\", written in 1949, is included as chapter 3 in Action this Day.  Deviser of Scottish Country Dances  Foss devised many Scottish country dances, including Fugal Fergus, John McAlpin, Polharrow Burn and The Wee Cooper o'Fife. He published several volumes of these from his own imprint, Glendarroch Press.  Later life Foss retired from GCHQ in 1953 to live at Glendarroch in St. John's Town of Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. He died in 1971 and is buried with his wife Alison in Dalry Kirkyard.

Roberts started his career at Crewe Alexandra at the age of 11, and progressed through the youth ranks at the club; signing a professional contract with The Railwaymen at the age of 19. He played six times during his seven years on the club's books, and was sent out on loan six times during his spell at the club. Following a loan spell at his hometown club, Northwich Victoria, he joined the club on a permanent basis in 2007. Roberts played 20 games for the Cheshire club during the second half of the 2006‚Äì07 season, before returning to the Football League with Accrington Stanley in summer 2007. He played 37 games for the club, before being loaned out to his former club, Northwich Victoria, a move which was later made permanent. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Roberts joined Stevenage on an initial one-month loan deal, before signing permanently in January 2009 for an undisclosed fee. He was made team captain ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, a campaign in which Roberts would help lead the side to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The following season, Roberts helped guide the club to back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. He has also spent two spells as caretaker manager of the club, once in January 2012 and again in March 2013. After a successful four-and-a-half-year spell at Stevenage, Roberts joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in July 2013. He captained Fleetwood to promotion via the play-offs during his first season with the club. After two seasons at Fleetwood, Roberts joined League Two club Cambridge United in May 2015, where he spent two seasons. He subsequently spent the 2017‚Äì18 season at fellow League Two club Forest Green Rovers, before signing for Warrington Town of the Northern Premier League in August 2018. Career Early career Born in Northwich, Cheshire, Roberts started his career at Crewe Alexandra at the age of 11. After progressing through the youth ranks he signed a professional contract with the club on 6 July 2003 at the age of 19. He joined Vauxhall Motors of the Northern Premier League Premier Division on loan and made his debut in a 3‚Äì2 win at home to Southport on 31 January 2004. His first goal came in a 2‚Äì0 home win over Alfreton Town on 6 March 2004, and finished the loan with 19 appearances, scoring three goals, before the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Roberts impressed for Crewe in several pre-season friendlies before the 2004‚Äì05 season, and played his first full 90 minutes for the club in Crewe's 2‚Äì1 friendly win against Everton. Roberts' pre-season performances led to Crewe assistant manager, Neil Baker, saying \\"Mark's a player that I felt could bridge the gap, having worked with him more than the other coaches. The way he coped should give him the belief to go on now.\\" He subsequently made his Crewe debut in September 2004, starting in a League Cup match against Sunderland, a game that Crewe won 4‚Äì2 in a penalty shoot-out after playing out a 3‚Äì3 draw after extra time. Shortly after, he made his league debut for Crewe in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Preston North End, and went on to make five more appearances before his run was curtailed by injury. After struggling to establish himself at Crewe Alexandra, Roberts spent time on loan with Merseyside based club Southport. Roberts made his Southport debut just three days after signing for the club, playing the whole match in a 4‚Äì0 away defeat to Accrington Stanley. He played six games for Southport, before then opting to join Chester City on a one-month loan deal. Roberts only started one game for Chester in a 5‚Äì0 defeat at Carlisle United, and did not feature again for the Cheshire club subsequent to this match. After his unsuccessful loan spell at Chester, Roberts was loaned out to Southport for a second time in March 2006, making his second debut for the club in a 2‚Äì1 win away to Forest Green Rovers, in which he was sent off in the 88th minute for two bookable offences. He returned to first team action in Southport's 1‚Äì1 draw against Altrincham, before playing the whole match in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Accrington Stanley at Haig Avenue. He played 12 times during his second loan spell at the club, playing his final game in Southport's 1‚Äì0 home loss against Aldershot Town in April 2006. Despite still being under contract at Crewe, Roberts had not made a first team appearance for the club since 2004 and was again loaned out ahead of the 2006‚Äì07 season, this time to Yorkshire-based Conference National club Halifax Town. He played his first game for Halifax in the club's first game of the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, starting in a 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Oxford United. He scored his first goal for Halifax in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Cambridge United, the first goal of the game. Roberts featured in thirteen games for the Halifax, scoring once, before ending his loan spell at the club. Roberts playing for Northwich Victoria in 2008 Shortly after, Roberts joined his hometown club Northwich Victoria on another loan deal. He made his debut for Northwich in a 3‚Äì1 away win at St Albans City at Clarence Park, and after playing in three matches, signed for the club on a permanent basis. He featured regularly during the second half of the 2006‚Äì07 season, which witnessed an up-turn in form for Northwich. As a result, Roberts returned to the Football League with Accrington Stanley in July 2007, joining the club for a fee set by a tribunal. Roberts started the first 30 games for the League Two club, whilst featuring in a further three as a substitute. However, he returned to Northwich Victoria on loan in March 2008. He helped Northwich to Conference Premier survival towards the end of the season, scoring his only goal in a match against fellow relegation candidates Stafford Rangers, and played nine times during the loan spell. Despite making a further brief appearance for Accrington towards the end of the season, Roberts re-joined Northwich on a permanent deal after his loan spell. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Roberts continued to play regularly in the centre of Northwich's defence, scoring once in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat against Weymouth in September 2008. He made twenty appearances for Northwich during the first half of the season. Stevenage Stevenage Borough in 2009 In November 2008, Roberts started for Northwich in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Broadhall Way in a match between Northwich and Stevenage, he subsequently joined the Hertfordshire club on loan a week after the match. The deal was made permanent on 1 January 2009, after impressing Graham Westley during his one-month loan spell. He scored his first Stevenage goal in a 2‚Äì0 FA Trophy win away to Farnborough, as well as scoring his second goal for the club in Stevenage's 4‚Äì0 win against Forest Green Rovers. He scored his first league goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 victory away to Altrincham, scoring a stoppage time goal to ensure Stevenage left Moss Lane with three points. Roberts followed this up with another goal in Stevenage's next away fixture, heading in the only goal of the game to give Stevenage a 1‚Äì0 win at Northwich Victoria, his former employers. He was sent off in the club's 2‚Äì1 home win against Cambridge United in April 2009, and continued to play regularly as Stevenage made the play-offs as a result of finishing in the final play-off place. He scored in the semi- final first leg against Cambridge United, heading in Steve Morison's ball across goal, but could not prevent Stevenage from losing 4‚Äì3 on aggregate over two legs. Roberts was awarded Stevenage's Player of the Year at the end of the season despite only joining the club in late November 2008. He also started in all seven of the club's successful FA Trophy campaign during that season, scoring twice in the process and playing in the team's 2‚Äì0 win against York City in the Final. In May 2009, it was announced that Roberts would be team captain for the 2009‚Äì10 season. On Roberts' appointment as captain, Stevenage manager Graham Westley said \\"Roberts is a natural leader who leads in the best way ‚Äì by example. He is the obvious choice.\\" Roberts formed a formidable centre-back pairing with Jon Ashton the following season as the team started putting a decent run of form together during late August and throughout September 2009; with the defence being particularly tight. He scored his first goal of the 2009‚Äì10 season on his 50th appearance for the club, giving Stevenage the lead in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Salisbury City in October 2009. A month later, he doubled his goal tally, scoring the second goal in Stevenage's 2‚Äì0 victory against Chester City, before notching his third goal of the season in a 6‚Äì0 win over Vauxhall Motors in the FA Trophy. Roberts' fourth goal of the campaign came during another 6‚Äì0 win, this time at Eastbourne Borough, side-footing the ball into the net from a well-worked free-kick. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3‚Äì0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow, sliding the ball into the net from close range. Roberts led the side out in their 2‚Äì0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010; the game that ultimately secured promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history, winning the league with two games to spare. Roberts played 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. Stevenage had the best defensive record in the league, conceding just 24 goals in 46 league matches, as well as ending the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceding just two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage. On signing the new deal, Roberts said \\"there was never any doubt that I wanted to stay here, I love the club and love the fans. It will be a privilege to lead the team in the Football League\\". At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Scott Laird. Roberts captained the side in the club's first ever Football League fixture at the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 season, playing the whole game in a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. He scored his first goal of the 2010‚Äì11 season in Stevenage's 3‚Äì0 away win at local rivals Barnet in November 2010. His second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Barnet in January 2011, this time scoring the fourth in a 4‚Äì2 win at Broadhall Way, as well as netting in a 4‚Äì0 win against Cheltenham Town on 26 February. A week later, Roberts was given a straight red card for bringing down Torquay United striker Chris Zebroski when he had rounded the goalkeeper, a match that Torquay would go on to win 2‚Äì0. He scored twice against Macclesfield Town on 26 March 2011, taking his goal tally for the 2010‚Äì11 campaign to five goals. Roberts scored his sixth goal of the season, his highest seasonal goal tally during his three years at Stevenage, in the club's 2‚Äì2 draw at Stockport County on 9 April 2011. The goal, a half- volley at the back post, gave Stevenage a brief lead in the match just after half-time. Stevenage faced one of Roberts' former employers, Accrington Stanley, in the 2010‚Äì11 League Two play-off semi-finals as a result of the club's sixth-place finish. Roberts played in both games, which Stevenage won by a 3‚Äì0 aggregate scoreline. He led the side out at Old Trafford for the final against Torquay United on 28 May 2011, playing the whole match as Stevenage went on to win 1‚Äì0. This meant that Roberts had captained the side to back-to-back promotions, earning a place in League One for the first time in their history. Stevenage also had the best defensive record in League Two during the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, conceding 45 goals. The campaign was also notable for Stevenage's FA Cup run into the Fourth Round, with Roberts playing in all five matches, including the club's 3‚Äì1 home victory over Premier League opposition in the form of Newcastle United. Roberts made 52 appearances in all competitions throughout the season, scoring six times. Roberts captained the side in their first ever League One fixture to start the 2011‚Äì12 season, a 0‚Äì0 draw against Exeter City on 6 August. He signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011. Two weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal of the 2011‚Äì12 campaign in Stevenage's 1‚Äì1 away draw against Oldham Athletic on 10 September. Roberts' goal came in the fourth minute of the match, heading in Michael Bostwick's shot to give Stevenage the lead. His second goal of the campaign came in the club's exit from the Football League Trophy on 4 October, with Roberts scoring a 20-yard volley in injury-time to take the game to penalties, which Stevenage subsequently lost 4‚Äì3. He described the volley as \\"easily the best goal of his career\\". Roberts scored once again, on 29 October, in a 2‚Äì1 away victory against Bury. The goal was a \\"glancing header\\" from Joel Byrom's cross to double Stevenage's advantage in the match with fifteen minutes remaining. A week later, he scored his fourth goal of the season in the club's 2‚Äì1 home win over Sheffield United, turning in the six-yard box before lashing a shot into the roof of the net to give Stevenage a first-half lead. Roberts' fifth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's last home game of 2011, scoring with a header from Robin Shroot's cross to give ten-man Stevenage a two-goal lead in an eventual 2‚Äì1 home victory against Tranmere Rovers. Following Graham Westley's departure to Preston North End on 13 January 2012, Roberts was made player-manager for Stevenage's away trip to Rochdale, with the club securing a 5‚Äì1 victory at Spotland on 14 January. He remained in-charge of the team for two further matches, a 1‚Äì1 draw at Scunthorpe United, and a 4‚Äì2 home victory against Milton Keynes Dons, until the appointment of manager Gary Smith allowed Roberts to concentrate on the playing side of the game. Under Roberts' guidance, Stevenage secured seven points out of a possible nine. He scored in successive games towards the latter stages of the season; a late equaliser against Preston North End, as well as netting the fifth goal in the club's 6‚Äì0 away win against Yeovil Town on 14 April 2012. Roberts played every minute of all 56 of Stevenage's games during the campaign, scoring seven goals from defence, with the club narrowly losing out in the play-off semi-finals. Stevenage also made it to the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, the furthest the club had reached in the competition; with Roberts playing in all six cup matches, including two matches against Tottenham Hotspur as the club took the Premier League side to a replay. He was also named as Stevenage's Player of the Year at the end of the season, becoming only the third player to win the award twice. Roberts playing for Stevenage in March 2013 In the summer of 2012, Stevenage announced that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with defensive partner Jon Ashton, from fellow League One club Doncaster Rovers. Despite the transfer speculation over the summer, he captained the side in Stevenage's first game of the 2012‚Äì13 season, scoring the third goal in a 3‚Äì1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup. Shortly after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. His second goal of the campaign came in another cup competition, scoring from close range to briefly restore parity in a 3‚Äì2 defeat away to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy in September 2012. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4‚Äì1 loss to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award as a result of his work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated ‚Äì \\"we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to day work and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition\\". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was once again placed in temporary charge while the club searched for a new manager. Just four days later, he took charge of Stevenage's televised away trip to promotion-chasing Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3‚Äì1 defeat. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1‚Äì1 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead despite them having to play with ten men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early dismissal. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was \\"proud of the phenomenal performance\\", and that \\"the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity we faced was probably something I haven't seen all season, to that level anyway\\". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was again able to concentrate solely on the playing side of his game. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals. During his successful four-and-a- half-year spell at Stevenage, Roberts made 239 appearances in all competitions, an appearance record that places him sixth on the club's all- time appearance list, and scored 27 goals. Fleetwood Town Following the expiry of his contract at Stevenage, rejecting the club's offer of a new contract, Roberts signed for League Two club Fleetwood Town on a free transfer. On joining Fleetwood, Roberts stated ‚Äì \\"I was massively impressed with this club from the first moment. Joining Fleetwood is an exciting prospect and I jumped at the chance after seeing the plans and hearing the chairman's vision\\". Shortly before the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Roberts was named as Fleetwood's new captain, stating it was a \\"massive honour to be named as club captain for the season\\". He scored just six minutes into his Fleetwood debut, also the first League Two goal of the new campaign, courtesy of a powerful header in a 3‚Äì1 home victory over Dagenham & Redbridge. Roberts was almost ever-present during the campaign and, similarly to his time at Stevenage, he also chipped in with a number of goals from central defence. He scored the winner in a 2‚Äì1 away victory at Rochdale on 14 December 2013, netting from close range after Nathan Pond's header had rebounded off the post and fallen into Roberts' path. He also scored in a 3‚Äì1 win over Bristol Rovers in March 2014, heading in a Josh Morris corner to double Fleetwood's lead. As a result of Fleetwood's fourth-place finish in League Two, the club competed in the League Two play-offs. Roberts played in all three matches, with the team keeping three consecutive clean sheets, as Fleetwood won promotion to League One for the first time in the club's history after a 1‚Äì0 victory over Burton Albion at Wembley Stadium in the final. Roberts made 45 appearances in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring three goals. He remained at Fleetwood for the club's first ever League One campaign, although started the season playing a largely peripheral role, featuring in just one match in the opening two months of the season. Roberts made his first league appearance of the season on 4 October 2014, playing the whole match as Fleetwood secured a 1‚Äì0 win over Port Vale at Highbury Stadium. Despite being part of the defence that kept Fleetwood's second clean sheet of the season, Roberts featured just once further until mid November. After playing the whole 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 away win at Yeovil Town, he was a regular starter for the remainder of the season. Similarly to a year earlier, he scored in an away win at Rochdale, this time heading in Stephen Dobbie's free-kick in a 2‚Äì0 win on 28 December 2014. Roberts scored his second goal of the season when he headed in a late equaliser as Fleetwood drew 1‚Äì1 with Peterborough United in February 2015. On the final day of the regular season, he scored Fleetwood's second goal in the club's 2‚Äì1 win over Port Vale on 3 May 2015, with Roberts tapping the ball in from a yard out after David Ball centred Josh Morris' cross. The game proved to be Roberts' final game for Fleetwood, as the club consolidated their place in League One courtesy of a tenth-placed finish. He made 72 appearances for Fleetwood in all competitions over his two years with the club, scoring six times. Roberts was released by Fleetwood upon the expiry of his contract in May 2015, one of 14 first-team players to be released, with Fleetwood manager Graham Alexander stating the club's \\"drive had shifted to focus on youth development\\". Cambridge United Roberts joined League Two club Cambridge United on 25 May 2015, signing a two-year deal. He was named as the club's captain, a position he had previously held at both Stevenage and Fleetwood Town. Roberts made his debut for Cambridge on the opening day of the 2015‚Äì16 season, playing the full 90 minutes as Cambridge comfortably defeated Newport County 3‚Äì0 at the Abbey Stadium. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì2 draw at York City on 3 October 2015, netting from close range as Cambridge fought back from two goals down to earn a point. A week later, Roberts was sent-off for violent conduct in Cambridge's 3‚Äì1 home defeat to Portsmouth. He was a regular starter for Cambridge up until the end of January 2016, when he was dropped ahead of an away match at Leyton Orient. He was subsequently replaced as captain by Luke Berry, with manager Shaun Derry stating \\"I've spoken to Mark and he's accepted it as a man. He'll respond in the right way because he's a leader of men\\". Roberts spent most of the remainder of the campaign as an unused substitute, although did feature more towards the end of the season, returning to score in a 7‚Äì0 win over Morecambe on 19 April 2016. He made 34 appearances for Cambridge in his first season with the club, scoring twice. Roberts stayed at Cambridge for the 2016‚Äì17 season, with the campaign following a similar pattern to the previous year as he was in and out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their first game of the season as they won 2‚Äì1 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game when he turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd-minute equaliser in an eventual 4‚Äì2 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd-minute winner in a 3‚Äì2 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a rebound in a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had been placed on the transfer-list with a year remaining on his contract. Forest Green Rovers Having made no appearances for Cambridge in the opening weeks of the 2017‚Äì18 campaign, Roberts' contract with the club was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 August 2017. On the same day, he signed for League Two club Forest Green Rovers on a one-year deal. He made his Forest Green debut two days after signing, playing the whole match in a 5‚Äì1 away defeat to Colchester United. Despite initially being a regular in the centre of defence for Forest Green, Roberts found himself out of the first-team picture from the start of 2018, his last appearance for the club coming in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Yeovil Town in the Football League Trophy on 9 January 2018. Having not made an appearance for four months, Roberts left Forest Green upon the expiry of his one-year deal in May 2018. He made 20 appearances during his brief stay with the club. Warrington Town Roberts joined Northern Premier League Premier Division club Warrington Town on a free transfer ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He made his Warrington debut in the club's opening league match of the campaign, a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Farsley Celtic. Roberts was subsequently named as club captain ahead of Warrington's next fixture away at Lancaster City, in what turned out to be their first win of the season. He scored his first goal for Warrington in the club's 3‚Äì3 draw with Nantwich Town on 23 February 2019. Roberts played regularly throughout the season as Warrington finished the season in third place in the Northern Premier Division. He played in all of the club's three play-off fixtures, winning the Northern Premier Division play-offs, before losing 3‚Äì2 after extra-time to King's Lynn Town in the step three super play- off final on 11 May 2019. Roberts made 49 appearances during the season, scoring twice. He signed a one-year contract extension with Warrington on 24 May 2019. Personal life Roberts was born and raised in Northwich, Cheshire. Roberts studied professional sports writing and broadcasting at Staffordshire University, graduating in 2012. He continued his studies after graduating from university, gaining two further football-based business qualifications at the Sports Business Institute. Roberts has stated he has a keen interest in \\"what goes on behind the scenes\\" in football, particularity at boardroom level, gaining his ACGP accreditation after enrolling himself in a corporate governance programme. He is studying for a Master of Business Administration degree at the University of Salford, with the degree focussed on CEOs in sport. He supports Manchester United, and was a season ticket holder at Old Trafford, where he sat in the Stretford End.

Situated near Wesleyville, it was formerly named Norton's Cove but was changed in 1879 when Captain Abram Kean and his family of nine moved there and renamed it Brookfield.Abram Kean, Old and Young Ahead Edited by Shannon Ryan, 2000. Norton's Cove was settled after 1874 and by 1891 had a population of 147 people; in 1911 the population had grown to 372.Naboth Winsor, Resounding God's Praises on Islands in Coves, 1990. The community has since been incorporated into the new municipality of New-Wes-Valley, along with several other former villages. Church History In 1891, 138 of the 147 inhabitants in Brookfield were Methodist. Therefore, in 1889 the people of Brookfield began building a church. It was completed and dedicated in July 1891 by Rev. James Nurse. The church could accommodate almost 200 people and it had a separate area for day and Sunday school. In 1905 a decision was made to build a separate school because the church was no longer large enough for the growing population. Money was being raised since 1891 and with it they renovated their church to make it larger. Ebenezer United Church is still in use in 2008. Captain Abram Kean Captain Abram Kean is one of Newfoundlands most famous sealing captains. He set a record for the most seal pelts at 1,052,737 during his career. Altogether he commanded nine steamers: The Wolf, Hope, Aurora, Terra Nova, Florizel, Stephano, Nascopie, Thetis, and Beothic II. He also set a record for most seals brought in from one voyage in 1910 with 49,069 pelts which was beaten in 1933 by a Captain Albert Blackwood.Abram Kean, Old and Young Ahead, Edited by Shannon Ryan, 2000. Interesting facts * Captain Abram Kean's nephew, Job Kean, lived in Brookfield and was a captain on many sealing steamers between 1896 and 1917. Job and wife Virtue (Hann), and later their youngest son Baxter Wesley Kean ran a general store in brookfield from around 1890 until 1979. The Job Kean Shop was designated a historic structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1988. * In the 1880s, the Bonavista District Ouport Road Boards for the area of Norton's Cove to Pound Cove was represented by Tiller, Bishop, Biddlecombe, Gibbons, Blackwood, Bishop, and Hounsel.The Newfoundland Almanac, 1887.

It is endemic to Mexico. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and it is only found on the narrow coastal strip of the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula. One of the key habitats of this species is the Petenes mangroves ecoregion of the Yucatan coast. It is threatened by habitat destruction. Description The adult Yucatan wren is a small species about long. The face is whitish with a dark eye-stripe and the crown is greyish brown. The upper parts are brown streaked with black and white and the wings are brown barred with dark brown and white. The tail is black barred with grey, with white tips to some of the outer feathers. The underparts are whitish with a dark cheek-stripe and blackish spotting and barring. The juvenile is similar in appearance to the adult but with less contrast between the upper and underparts. Distribution and habitat The Yucatan wren is endemic to a coastal strip of the Yucatan peninsula. It can be found in arid areas with scrub and large cacti, and also the edges of pastureland. Its breeding range is even more restricted to a strip about one kilometre wide edging the mangrove forests which fringe the coast. Ecology The Yucatan wren is usually seen in pairs or small family groups and forages among the foliage and on the ground. Its diet is unknown. The Yucatan wren starts nest-building activities in April but eggs are not laid until June. The nests are globular grass structures with side-entrances, and are built a few metres off the ground in coastal scrub and the borders of the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) forest which thrives along the coasts of the region. Clutch size averages three eggs and both parents help rear the chicks. A third adult has been observed feeding the chicks occasionally, an example of cooperative breeding. Status The population of the Yucatan wren is believed to be stable but its range is small, and the bird is threatened by habitat loss as the area in which it lives is developed for tourism. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as a \\"near-threatened species\\". References * World Wildlife Fund. 2010.

Chesterfield Having been close to joining Blackburn Rovers, he instead signed for Chesterfield, where he made his debut in 1919 at the age of just 16. He went on to play 70 league games for the Spireites before joining Leeds United towards the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season. Leeds United Edwards played for the Elland Road club for 18 years, during which time he was never booked or sent off. He went on to make 444 appearances. Edwards continued turning out for Leeds during the war years and remained at the club after the war. On retiring as a player, he became assistant and he took over the managerial reins when Billy Hampson was dismissed in May 1947. His time as manager was relatively unsuccessful and he resumed his place in the backroom staff in April 1948, where he acted as a scout for the club. He only ended his association with Leeds in 1960, after serving the club for 35 years. England Edwards was capped by England on 16 occasions. His first cap was against Wales on 1 March 1926.

It is found in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica and Panama. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical mangrove forest, and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland. It is threatened by habitat destruction. Description 200px The yellow-billed cotinga grows to an adult length of about . The male has the crown of the head suffused with pearly-grey, but otherwise the plumage closely resembles the much more common snowy cotinga (Carpodectes nitidus), being pure white. However, this bird has a yellow beak, rather than the bluish-grey bill of the snowy cotinga. The female resembles the female snowy cotinga, with its pale brownish-grey upper parts, and greyish-white underparts; it also has a yellow beak. Distribution and habitat The yellow-billed cotinga is endemic to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and the extreme west of Panama. It occurs in a number of small, separate enclaves, the most northerly of which is in Costa Rica at the mouth of the T√°rcoles River and in the Carara National Park nearby. The largest populations are in the area of the Golfo Dulce and the Osa Peninsula, and the main nesting area is at the mouth of the Sierpe River. There are several other locations in Costa Rica where it occurs and it has been seen in Panama, but sightings there are sporadic. It mostly inhabits mangrove forests but is sometimes seen in scrubland and adjacent lowland forests, and occasionally in isolated trees in more open countryside. Behaviour The behaviour of this bird has been little studied. The males (and sometimes the females) perch high in trees by the Sierpe River and fly back and forth low over the water. A swooping form of flight has been observed which is possibly a courtship display. Status Although no exact count has been made of these birds, it is estimated that there are between 150 and 700 mature individuals in total, and that the population is declining. The chief threat they face is the destruction of the mangrove forests in which they live for conversion of the land into shrimp ponds, pasture and rice cultivation. Inland from the mangroves, much of the lowland forest has been felled and the construction of roads and dykes has changed the hydrology of the area. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this bird as \\"endangered\\".

It is found in the Choc√≥ region, from southeastern Panama to northwestern Ecuador ; its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. The male, being white, is conspicuous, but in general it is an uncommon species. Description The black-tipped cotinga reaches an adult length of and has a black bill, red eyes and short rounded wings. The male is pure white except for a narrow black tip to the outer wing feathers and, in young individuals, a black tip to the central tail feathers. The female looks very different, having the head and upper parts brownish-grey, and the wings and tail brownish-black. The wing-coverts and the inner flight feathers have broad white margins. The underparts are pale grey fading to white on the belly. Ecology The white plumage of the male makes it very conspicuous, especially when it perches on an emergent branch high above the canopy or when it flies in its typical slow, looping manner. It is more gregarious than birds in the closely related genus Cotinga, often making swooping flights in mixed- sex groups. No song or call is known for this bird.

It is endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, where it inhabits evergreen montane forests at altitudes of . Although it has a limited range and is not a common bird, the IUCN has assessed it as being a \\"least-concern species\\". Description The Sulawesi thrush is a medium-sized species with a long beak, short rounded wings and robust legs. The head and upper parts are a dark olive brown and the underparts are somewhat paler, sometimes with a gingery or reddish tinge to the under-tail coverts. There is a distinctive black supercilium above the eye. Distribution The Sulawesi thrush is endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Its habitat is evergreen montane forest and moss-forest and its altitudinal range lies between . Four subspecies are recognised; C. t. abditiva from the northern part of the island; C. t. tenebrosa from the southern part; C. t. turdoides from southwestern Sulawesi and C. t. heinrichi from the southeast. It is not present in the central part of the island. Ecology The Sulawesi thrush is a shy bird that is seldom seen and has been little studied. The diet consists of fruits and invertebrates and it forages in the middle and lower storeys of the canopy in evergreen montane forests, and on the ground beneath the trees. In behaviour and appearance it resembles thrushes in the genus Turdus, but it has other behaviours which are similar to those of the Old World babblers (Timaliidae), and the laughing thrushes (Garrulax).

It is monotypic within the genus Catharopeza. It has a dark back that fades into a lighter gradient going towards the chest. It also has a dark head,a dark strip on the breast, and a light orbital. Both male and female have the same plumage. It is endemic to the island of Saint Vincent in the Lesser Antilles. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. It is threatened by habitat loss. This habitat loss is due to volcanic activity and deforestation. Whistling warblers have cup-shaped nests, and spotted eggs. Their diet primarily consists of insects.  Taxonomy  The whistling warbler was originally given the genus, Leucopeza bishopi, but it was later changed to Catharopeza bishopi because of its stoutness in many areas of its body. There are competing beliefs on who the closest relative to the whistling warbler (Catharopeza) is between Phaeothlypis and Dendroica. A study done by Mark Robins and Theodore Parker in 1976 argued that Phaeothlypis was Catharopeza‚Äôs closest relative. This was argued by comparing various characteristics of Phaeothlypis, Dendroica, and Catharopeza. For example, Catharopeza has a dark plumage, while Dendroica has a green one, and Catharopeza‚Äôs foraging, morphology, and song were more similar to Phaeothlypis‚Äô than Dendroica‚Äôs. Other studies believed Dendroica was Catharopeza‚Äôs closest relative. The closeness in relationship between Dendroica and Catharopeza has been widely recognized. When charted according to taxon, they are often placed adjacent to each other due to their similarities in morphology and song. A study that sequenced the DNA of Dendroica and Catharopeza found that Catharopeza‚Äôs closest relative in the Dendroica genus was the Dendroica plumbea species.  Description  The whistling warbler is often compared to a wren in appearance. It has a dusty-black plumage, with a dark head and bill. Some interpretations of the whistling warbler have stated that they have a medium- brown plumage. A bright white ring surrounds the eye, with a hazel iris. There is also an off-white color on a minor portion of the chin and on the ends of feathers on the upper throat. The breast has a black and white stripped-like pattern, with the black between two white bands. The underside of the tail goes from a blackish ash gray to an off-white. The tail's two distal feathers have a white triangle at the end of them. The tarsus and toes are a light orange color, and they also have a small manubrium-sternum bridge. Females have the same plumage. Whistling warblers' length ranges from 5 ¬Ω inches to 5 ¬æ inches. Their wings are 2 ¬æ in, tail is 2 ¬Ω in, tarsus is 7/8 in, and wingspan is 8 ¬Ω inches in length. The immature whistling warbler has black feathers emerging on the crown and has the same appearance of the tail's feather tips as the adult, with the overall tail feather color being black. There is a dark greenish brown color on the top, and lighter color on the bottom. In place of the white marks in an adult, a light reddish-brown is present. The quills are brown. The whistling warbler's song has a rapid rhythm, with an increasing intensity that is comparable to the Troglodytes rufescen, with less variation. The call is compared to a weaker olive-backed thrush song. In Andrle and Andrle's study in 1986, they found that the average of the most common songs were about 4 to 6 second. They also found that the Whistling Warbler's songs could be heard from morning to late afternoon, unless it was heavily raining.  Distribution and habitat  Whistling warblers inhabit the hills and mountains of St. Vincent island, including Richmond Peak, and Grand Bonhomme. St. Vincent is 18 miles in length and is located 13 degrees 10‚Äô north latitude, and 60 degrees 57‚Äô west longitude. Other than the hills and mountains, volcanoes are also present on this island that are both inactive and active. On the top of the hills there are no seasons without rain and with 3800mm of yearly rain, are considered rain forests. These rain forests range from 300 m to 500 m in elevation. Whistling warbler distribution has changed over time. Before an eruption in 1902, whistling warblers were usually found 300m above sea level, but after they are now found in areas 300m to 600m above sea level, with more of them found at lower levels than higher levels. This higher occurrence of Whistling Warblers in lower levels is due to more ravines, gorges, and valleys in those areas and more wet slopes in higher altitudes.  Relationship with humans and status  Volcanic activity and deforestation have led to the whistling warbler's endangerment. The volcanoes on the island have erupted and caused detrimental effects on the habitat. Europeans hurt the Whistling warbler population by deforesting areas for sugarcane. With the combination of volcanic activity and deforestation, it has decreased the Whistling warbler population by 50%. They are starting to re-inhabit Soufriere in St. Vincent and have a distribution of about 90 km2.  Behavior and ecology   Breeding  The whistling warbler's cup-shaped nests are found at low levels and spotted eggs have been seen in them. Nesting has been found to occur in July in one observation, and April in another. Chicks with developed wings from a few days old to a week were seen out of the nest.  Diet and foraging  Whistling warblers forage at low levels usually from the ground to 4 m, and at most at 15 m. They can be found foraging in large rocks along streams, boulders, and decayed logs. They feed on insects, herbaceous plants, and in one case a lizard species was found in the stomach of a whistling warbler. While foraging they hop from branch to branch with a ‚Äúcocked tail‚Äù. The whistling warbler often flicks its cocked tail swiftly when observed foraging.

Polaris is a composite program consisting of a number of bots, including Hyperborean08, the winner of the limit equilibrium series in the 2008 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Computer Poker Competition. Polaris also contains a number of other fixed strategies, and chooses between these strategies during a match. Polaris requires little computational power at match time, so it is run on an Apple MacBook Pro laptop during competitions. Polaris plays only heads- up (two player) Limit Texas hold'em. Play against professionals On July 23‚Äì24, 2007, Polaris played against poker professionals Phil Laak and Ali Eslami at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Vancouver, B.C. The competition consisted of four duplicate matches, with 500 hands per match. In each duplicate match, the same cards were dealt to both pairs of players, human and bot, but with the seating reversed. This meant that if Polaris had poor hands in one half of the match against Laak, the other copy of Polaris would be getting good cards in the other half of the match against Eslami. This was done to reduce variance, or \\"luck factor\\", as neither team could say they got the worse set of cards. The two players were in separate rooms to eliminate the chance of the audience revealing information about the hands, which would be especially problematic in a duplicate match. Laak had previously played the Polaris predecessor Vexbot in 2005 in a prior tournament. Laak admitted to luck playing a part in his victory over Vexbot. After roughly 64 hours of play over two days, Polaris tied the first round, won the second and lost the last two. One of the lost matches was against a learning variant which tried to switch between a few styles of play, while all of the remainder were against large, static, randomized sets of rules which approximate a pair of Nash equilibrium strategies. Laak and Eslami split $1 for the two wins, and $2,500 for the draw. On July 3‚Äì6, 2008, Polaris competed against six human professional poker players in the Second Man-Machine Poker Championship, held in Las Vegas at the 2008 Gaming Life Expo. Polaris defeated the human players with three wins, two losses and one tie. Each of the six sessions was a duplicate match of 500 hands against two different players, resulting in six thousand hands played. Across all six sessions, Polaris won 195 big blinds. The version of Polaris used in the 2008 match was much stronger than the 2007 version, both in the quality of the component strategies and in its ability to learn which component strategy to use.

The male bird is entirely black, with a black crest and inflatable wattle on the throat, and at , may be the largest passerine bird in South America. The female is slightly smaller. Both have an undulating flight, described as woodpecker-like, and the male has a loud, booming call. Podocarpus Reserve - Ecuador The Amazonian umbrellabird feeds on fruit and berries, and may opportunistically take insects and spiders. It forages singly, in pairs or in small groups, in the forest canopy, hopping from branch to branch, but is a secretive species and is more often heard than seen. Description Much larger than the female, the male Amazonian umbrellabird is likely the largest passerine in South America as well as the largest suboscine passerine in the world. The male Amazonian umbrellabird grows to a weight of and a length of . The female averages and weighs up to .The Birds of Ecuador, Vol. 2: Field Guide, Robert S. Ridgely & Paul J. Greenfield, Cornell University Press (2001). Birds of Venezuela, Steven L. Hilty, Princeton University Press (2003). As in the other umbrellabirds, the Amazonian umbrellabird is almost entirely black, has a conspicuous crest on the top of their head, and an inflatable wattle on the neck, which serves to amplify their loud, booming calls. This species has pale eyes, whereas in other umbrellabirds the eye is black. The undulating flying method of this species is considered quite woodpecker-like, with the lack of white on the umbrellabird's plumage distinguishing it from large woodpeckers it co-exists with. The Amazonian umbrellabird is usually seen flying only across openings in the forest, such as over rivers, and usually boldly hops branch to branch while in trees. Distribution This species occurs in two main populations: One found in woodland and forest, mainly near rivers, in the Amazon basin, and a second found in forested foothills of the eastern Andes. The Amazonian umbrellabird is found variously in small groups, pairs or individually. They are usually seen in or near the canopy but due to their wary behavior and scarcity at open spots they are easily missed for a bird of this size. They are heard in the field more often than they are seen. Fruit and berries are usually preferred but insects, spiders and insect larvae are eaten opportunistically.http://animals.jrank.org/pages/1052/Cotingas-Cotingidae- AMAZONIAN-UMBRELLABIRD-Cephalopterus-ornatus-SPECIES-ACCOUNTS.html References * A Guide to the Birds of Colombia, Steven L.

It winters down hill and further south. Further to the east, birds tend to be smaller and the plumage becomes gradually darker.  Taxonomy  The species was once considered to be a kinglet but is today treated as a tit. It is placed in a monotypic genus, Cephalopyrus. Its previous assignment to the family Remizidae was not entirely satisfactory, as this species nests in hollows in trees, as do the true tits and chickadees (Paridae), so it was placed there. It also lays blue eggs, like the verdin Auriparus flaviceps, and not white. Its small cone-shaped bill, and its song however are typical for a penduline tit.  Description  left  Male  Outside the breeding season (September‚ÄìJanuary), the crown is dark olive-brown, with a yellowish olive- green border. The upper parts are yellowish to olive-green. The rump yellowish to olive-golden yellow. The longest tail feathers are dark gray. The tail is dark olive-brown, all the feathers being tipped with white. The wings are the same color as the tail, but with olive-yellow edging larger or smaller on all blankets and feathers. The throat is white. Chest, belly and flanks show a yellow lemon, contrasting with the gray of the thighs, anal area and the underside of the tail. In breeding plumage (February‚ÄìJuly), the male has a slight orange-scarlet colored crest. The eyebrow and around the eye is golden yellow tinged with red. The cheeks, ear coverts and sides of the neck are olive-yellow. The chin and upper throat are orange chrome, melting into golden yellow chest. The sides of the chest and the upper sides are yellow-olive. The rear flanks and belly are pale yellow. The tips of the tail and wing feathers are white but worn. Year round, the iris is brown to dark brown, the bill dark blue-gray with a darker tip. Legs and feet are dark blue-gray. The underwing coverts are white with a yellow fringe tip.  Female  Outside the breeding season, the female is not very different from her partner, although the upper parts (including the cheeks, brow and sides of the neck) are olive- green gray. The chin and throat are whitish gray, blending into the dull gray of the rest of the underparts. The chest is yellow-tinged olive, the upper sides and belly are pale yellow tinged. The axillary and the underside of the wings are gray. In breeding plumage, the forehead is yellow-olive drab. The top of the lower parts (chin and throat chest) olive-yellow contrasts sharply with the belly and anal area whitish yellow.  Egg  Eggs have a dull blue-green color.  Sounds  Calls include a high-pitched but ample and jerky \\"tsit-tsit-tsit-tsit\\" at irregular intervals. Contact call is a soft and low \\"whitoo-whitoo\\". When singing, the male flies or sits on a high well- exposed spot like the top of a tree. The song lasts several minutes. It consists of a series of rapid, high notes, forming well-constructed sentences: \\"pit'su-pit'su-pit'su-pit'su\\".  Behaviour  The fire-capped tit is not shy. It is always active, giving little wing strokes like a warbler. It is reminiscent of the small tit Sylviparus modestus. During migration and in winter, it is usually found in small flocks, but groups of up to 100 may be seen. Most of the time, these groups, flying high above the bare hills, are monotypic, but they sometimes join mixed flocks when foraging. The flight is powerful like that of finches. It seeks its food higher up in large trees, but also sometimes in the bushes close to the ground. It is rather agile, adopting acrobatic positions, upside down, or sliding along vertical branches like parrots. This tit is able to open rolled-up leaves with its beak as starlings do, and hold it with its foot.  Feeding  The fire-capped tit feeds largely on insects but also leaves, flowers, buds and probably pollen and sap. Captured prey is held with the feet and processed with the bill. Large insects are opened and emptied of their contents, the empty carapace being discarded. This practice is quite similar to that of other tits, but unlike them, the fire-capped tit does not cut its prey into small pieces.  Nesting  The nesting season runs from early April to mid-June. The nest is built in a hollow inside a trunk or large branch. The fire-capped tit prefers cavities with their entrance protected by a branch or scar. It usually uses natural cavities but often takes over an abandoned woodpecker nest. Occasionally, a hollow is excavated where a rotting branch fell off. The nest, usually between 6 and 12 meters above the ground, is often very difficult to detect. The nest itself is a bowl built of dry grass, rootlets and sometimes a few feathers. It is lined with finer grasses and feathers. This is done by the female, while the male protects the territory. There are usually four dull blue-green eggs. The incubation period is unknown. If she is disturbed, she tries to deter the intruders by inflating her feathers and making hissing sounds. It is unknown if the male takes part in incubating. Youngsters are fed by both parents. The female takes care of maintenance and cleaning of the nest on her own.  Habitat  The fire-capped tit occurs in forest, woodlands and regions with solitary trees. It prefers temperate rainforest and mixed deciduous forest with oak, hazel, elm and walnut, just below the conifer belt. At higher altitudes it frequents clusters of cherry and scattered willows. In Kashmir and Ladakh it nests in shrubs at high altitude. In China it is reported in spruce, fir and rhododendron. In Thailand, it stays in deciduous hillside forests. Nesting occurs at different altitudes depending on the region. In Pakistan, the fire-capped tit nests between and , in the northwest of India from 1800 m to , and in Nepal from to . Western populations winter in the plains of North-Central India. Populations of the eastern Himalayas spend the period from November to May in southern Sikkim, between and . In the far east of the breeding range, seasonal migration is less pronounced, and in Sichuan and Burma the birds remain during the winter at relatively high altitudes, around 1800 meters. During the winter it is also found in evergreen broad- leaved forest in Thailand.  Subspecies and distribution  * C. f. flammiceps (E.

His usual position was fullback or wing. In January 2013, Stoddart retired from rugby due to injury. His brother Hywel Stoddart is also a professional rugby union player.  Career   Treorchy RFC  Stoddart began his rugby career at Treorchy RFC, working his way through the club's youth ranks before finally making it into the senior team for the 2003‚Äì04 season while still only 18 years old. Stoddart made most of his appearances at fly-half that season, scoring over 250 points for the Rhondda club. However, Treorchy were relegated from the First Division and Stoddart was given a trial at Pontypridd RFC.  Pontypridd RFC  Unlike the previous season, Pontypridd deployed Stoddart at fullback for most of his appearances in the 2004‚Äì05 season, and gradually earned a reputation as one of the most attacking prospects in the Premiership. The following year, Stoddart made the number 15 shirt at Sardis Road his own, and his explosive breaks were said to have provided the catalyst for Ponty's 2006 Konica Minolta Cup triumph over Neath.  Scarlets  Stoddart's performances did not go unnoticed by the Welsh regional sides, and he eventually signed a professional contract with the Llanelli Scarlets in 2006. Throughout the 2006‚Äì07 season, Stoddart played as understudy to Wales international Barry Davies, playing most of his matches for Llanelli RFC, but he eventually made his breakthrough to the regional side in the latter half of the season, making nine appearances, including two in the Heineken Cup. He also scored two tries, including a 25-yard effort against Ulster in the Heineken Cup. Stoddart's efforts were rewarded when he won the Principality Premiership Player of the Year award for his contribution during the 2006/07 season for Llanelli.2005‚Äì2007 Principality Premiership Awards During the 2007‚Äì08 season, Stoddart was given the chance to play at fullback regularly, following the departure of Barry Davies to Brive. Stoddart put in excellent performances which would lead to an international call up to the Welsh national team.  Wales  On 14 November 2007, Stoddart was given his first call-up to the Wales national rugby union team, for the Prince William Cup match against South Africa, and on 20 November, it was announced that he would be given the number 15 shirt as Wales' starting fullback. Although Wales lost 12‚Äì34, Stoddart shone on his debut, setting up Wales' first try and scoring the second. In January 2011 he was recalled to the Wales squad for the 2011 Six Nations Championship,2011 Wales squad a tournament in which he scored two tries in three appearances, one in the opener against England and the other against Italy. On 6 August 2011 during a World Cup warm up match between Wales and England, Stoddart broke his left leg after being tackled by Delon Armitage. The incident was so graphic that match broadcaster Sky Sports chose not to show a replay. The injury ended any hopes Stoddart had of playing in that year's World Cup in New Zealand.

Opened in 1969 along with the airport, the train system was replaced in 1981 with the current WEDway system, built by WED Transportation Systems, a division of what is now known as Walt Disney Imagineering. The Subway serves approximately 240,000 passengers per month, for a yearly ridership averaging 2.9 million. It is built underground and serves landside traffic, unlike the newer Skyway, which is elevated and operates airside. The Subway is notable as the only WEDway people mover built by the Walt Disney Company outside of a Disney property. It uses much of the mechanical technology used by the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover, an attraction in the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The design permits the trains to make tight corners that are necessary along portions of the basement route. Like their Disney counterparts, the trains are completely unpowered, relying on linear induction motors in the track for propulsion. Platform screen doors at each station have a special mechanism unlocking the trains' doors, and on-train station announcements and audible warning messages are provided by a trackside audio system through openings in the tops of the vehicle car-bodies. Eight three-car trains are used on the system, of which six operate at any single time at three-minute intervals at speeds of up to . They stop at eight stations in a circuit serving every terminal and the Houston Airport Hotel, for a round-trip time of 18 minutes. The system is currently maintained and operated by JBT Aerotech. Houston Airport System, the owner of the airport, is conducting preliminary studies of potential new systems to replace the Subway, as both it and major airlines serving the airport have determined that the cost of operating and maintaining the system is no longer viable.

A grammar is essentially noncontracting if there may be one exception, namely, a rule S ‚Üí Œµ where S is the start symbol and Œµ the empty string, and furthermore, S never occurs in the right-hand side of any rule. None of the rules of a noncontracting grammar decreases the length of the string that is being rewritten. If each rule even properly increases the length, the grammar is called a growing context-sensitive grammar.  History  Chomsky (1963) called a noncontracting grammar a type 1 grammar; in the same work, he called a context-sensitive grammar a \\"type 2 grammar\\", and he proved that these two are weakly equivalent (context-free grammars were designated \\"type 4\\" in this work). Here: pp. 360‚Äì363 and 367 The type numbering scheme in this 1963 work of Chomsky does not coincide with the earlier one known today as the Chomsky hierarchy because he was trying to emphasize the distinction between weak [generative] and strong [structural] equivalence; in his 1959 work he had used \\"type 1 grammar\\" to denote a context-sensitive grammar and \\"type 2\\" for context-free.Chomsky, N. 1959a.

A context- sensitive grammar for the same language is shown below.  Transforming into context-sensitive grammar  Every noncontracting grammar (N, Œ£, P, S) can be transformed into a context-sensitive grammar (N‚Äô, Œ£, P‚Äô, S) as follows: # For every terminal symbol a ‚àà Œ£, introduce a new nonterminal symbol [a] ‚àà N‚Äô, and a new rule ([a] ‚Üí a) ‚àà P‚Äô. # In the rules of P, replace every terminal symbol a by its corresponding nonterminal symbol [a]. As a result, all these rules are of the form ‚Üí for nonterminals Xi, Yj and m‚â§n. # Replace each rule ‚Üí with m>1 by 2m rules:For convenience, the non-context part of left and right hand side is shown in boldface. ::{ -  X1  X2  ...

In the 2003 edition, the chapter on noncontracting / context-sensitive languages has been omitted. For example, the above noncontracting grammar for { anbncn  n ‚â• 1 } leads to the following context-sensitive grammar (with start symbol S) for the same language: { -   [a]  ‚Üí  a     from step 1 -   [b]  ‚Üí  b     from step 1 -   [c]  ‚Üí  c     from step 1 -   S  ‚Üí  [a]  [b]  [c]   from step 2, unchanged -   S  ‚Üí  [a]  S  B  [c]  from step 2, unchanged -  ~~[c]~~  ~~B~~  ~~‚Üí~~  ~~B~~  ~~[c]~~    from step 2, further modified below -  [c]  B  ‚Üí  Z1  B    modified from above in step 3 -  Z1  B  ‚Üí  Z1  Z2    modified from above in step 3 -  Z1  Z2  ‚Üí  B  Z2    modified from above in step 3 -  B  Z2  ‚Üí  B  [c]    modified from above in step 3 -  ~~[b]~~  ~~B~~  ~~‚Üí~~  ~~[b]~~  ~~[b]~~    from step 2, further modified below -  [b]  B  ‚Üí  Z3  B    modified from above in step 3 -  Z3  B  ‚Üí  Z3  Z4    modified from above in step 3 -  Z3  Z4  ‚Üí  [b]  Z4    modified from above in step 3 -  [b]  Z4  ‚Üí  [b]  [b]    modified from above in step 3 }  Expressive power  Similarly, there is an easy procedure for bringing any noncontracting grammar into Kuroda normal form. , Theorem 2.2, p. 190 Vice versa, every context-sensitive grammar and every Kuroda normal form grammar is trivially also a noncontracting grammar. Therefore, noncontracting grammars, grammars in Kuroda normal form, and context-sensitive grammars have the same expressive power. To be precise, the noncontracting grammars describe exactly the context-sensitive languages that do not include the empty string, while the essentially noncontracting grammars describe exactly the set of context-sensitive languages.

They reside mostly in the cities of Armavir and Maykop. The total number of Cherkosogai is about 50,000 people (2008 estimate). According to the Russian 2002 Census, 230 Armenians speak Lowland Adyghe and 222 speak Kabardian Adyghe natively.2002 All-Russia Population Census: Language (except Russian) population of the most numerous nationalities (with a population of 400 thousand people or more) Notable Cherkesogai include the first Soviet millionaire Artyom Mikhailovich Tarasov, Prix Goncourt-winning writer Henri Troyat (n√© Lev Aslanovich Tarasov), merchant Nikita Pavlovich Bogarsukov and ballerina Olga Aslanovna Tarasova. History Since the early Medieval period, many Armenians have lived as diaspora, due to foreign invasions of Armenia, national and religious persecution, genocide and wars. Most of the present-day Armenian diaspora in the North Caucasus arrived in the 17th and 18th centuries, though the first Hemshin Armenians arrived in the 8th century. The migrations of Armenians to the Kuban took place in a series of waves. The first took place from the late 1780s to the 1860s, when around 3,000 Armenians came from the Russian towns of Astrakhan, Kizlyar and Mozdok, as well as around 300 Persian Turkish Armenians. During this period, the first Armenian settlements in the Kuban were founded, including Armavir, founded in 1839, considered to be the first. Armenians also established communities in larger towns such as Novorossiysk, Anapa and Ekaterinodar. A second wave of migrants came during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, when around 30,000 mostly Turkish Hemshin Armenians arrived in the region, along with a few from Persia and Transcaucasia. Some came for economic reasons and were attracted by Russian government, while others were forced to leave due to oppression and genocide by the Ottoman government. Migration peaked from the late 1870s to the late 1910s, coinciding with the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, pogroms against Armenians in Turkey and Baku and the 1915‚Äì1920 mass persecution of the Armenian population in Turkey. A third wave of migration took place during the 1950s and comprised less than 300 ethnic Armenians of Georgia (Akhalkalaki Armenians) who mostly settled in Anapsky District, mainly in Gaikodzor. The fourth wave took place in the 1970s and consisted mainly of ethnic Armenians of Azerbaijan (Karabakh Armenians) and Central Asia, such as the Uzbek, Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs. They primarily came to Krasnodar Krai for economic reasons and numbered from 5,000 to 7,000 people. From the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s, around 300,000 more migrants arrived in the Kuban region as a result of the ethnic conflicts across the former Soviet Union, such as those in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Some later came as a result of poor economic conditions in the newly formed republics, from Armenia, Georgia and Central Asia.

The system is 0.7 miles (1.1 km) long, and runs along the north side of the airport, beyond airport security. The system serves all of the airport's five terminals, with four stations at Terminal A, Terminal B, Terminal C, and International Terminal D/E, respectively. Skyway (which operates airside) is one of two people movers currently operating at Bush Intercontinental Airport. The other people mover (which operates landside) opened in 1969 and is known as the Subway (formerly the Inter-terminal Train). The system uses Bombardier Innovia APM 100 people mover vehicles, which are powered from a 600-volt third rail. There are a total of 12 vehicles in the system, and each vehicle travels at 30 mph (50 km/h) and can hold up to 80 passengers. The same type of vehicles are also found at Denver International Airport (Automated Guideway Transit System), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (The Plane Train), San Francisco International Airport (AirTrain), and Tampa International Airport. History The TerminaLink system opened on May 24, 1999 as a 0.1 mile (0.2 km) line with two stations, connecting Terminal C and Terminal B with a maintenance building for the rail vehicles between the two terminals. The system was funded by Continental Airlines at a cost of US $58 million, and was built to provide easy access between the airline's two airport terminals. Construction was completed in a total of 30 months and was the last phase of Continental's US $200 million airport expansion project. In 2001, the system was expanded 0.6 mile (0.9 km) from Terminal C to Terminal D. The electrical work for the expansion was supervised by TAG Electric Company who installed over 71 miles (114 km) of cables and wires for the project. The airport has expanded the line to Terminal A at a cost of US $100 million, and construction began in early 2008 and was completed in 2010.Houston Airport System In 2015, the airport updated its branding. As part of the initiative, TerminaLink and the Inter-terminal Train were renamed to Skyway and Subway, respectively. The new names refer to each APM's location; Skyway is the elevated track, while Subway is underground. This was intended to make it easier for travelers to differentiate the two lines. Skyway vehicles also received blue and green body wraps with the new name.

The black honeyeater exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is endemic to Australia, and ranges widely across the arid areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly in areas where the emu bush and related species occur. A nectar feeder, the black honeyeater has a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers such as those of the emu bush. It also takes insects in the air, and regularly eats ash left behind at campfires. Cup-shaped nests are built in the forks of small trees or shrubs. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest-building or incubating the clutch of two to three eggs. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread and hence is considered to be of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species. Taxonomy Elizabeth Gould's illustration of a female and male drawn from naturealt=Illustration of a brown female and black male on a plant The black honeyeater was first described by English naturalist John Gould in 1838 as Myzomela nigra, using as the specific epithet the Latin adjective niger 'black'. The genus name was derived from the Ancient Greek words myzo 'to suckle' and meli 'honey', and referred to the bird's nectivorous habits. Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori described it as Glyciphila nisoria in 1878, though he incorrectly wrote that it originated in New Guinea. In the 1913 Official Checklist of the Birds of Australia, Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews placed the black honeyeater in the genus Cissomela with the banded honeyeater. He then placed it in its own genus Sugomel in 1922, the name being derived from the Latin sugo 'suck', and mel 'honey'. In 1967 ornithologist Finn Salomonsen transferred the species from Myzomela to the genus Certhionyx, which also contained the banded honeyeater (Certhionyx pectoralis) and pied honeyeater (Certhionyx variegatus), and later authorities accepted this classification. Australian ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason kept the three in the same genus, but conceded the basis for this was weak and classified each species in its own subgenus‚ÄîSugomel for the black honeyeater. In a 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters, the three species classified in the genus Certhionyx were found not to be closely related to one another. Instead, the black honeyeater was closely related to species within Myzomela after all. However, it was an early offshoot and quite divergent genetically, leading study authors Amy Driskell and Les Christidis to recommend it be placed in its own genus rather than returned to Myzomela.. It was subsequently moved to the resurrected genus Sugomel. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA indicated that the ancestor of the black honeyeater diverged from that of the scaly-crowned honeyeater (Lichmera lombokia) just under a million years ago, and that the two have some affinities with the genus Myzomela. It is identified as Sugomel niger by the International Ornithological Committee's (IOC) Birdlist. Mathews described two subspecies‚ÄîMyzomela nigra westralensis from Western Australia on the basis of smaller size and darker plumage, and Myzomela nigra ashbyi from Mount Barker, South Australia, on the basis of larger size and paler plumage‚Äîneither of which is regarded as distinct today. DNA analysis has shown the honeyeater family Meliphagidae to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea.. The Papuan black myzomela, (Myzomela nigrita), found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is also known as the black honeyeater. It is a different but related species. Black honeyeater has been adopted as the official name by the IOC. It is also known as the charcoal bird from collecting ashes after campfires. Description A female on a Jacaranda The black honeyeater has a long, slender, down-curved bill, a small rounded head and slender neck set on a plump body, and a short, slightly cleft tail. It is between long, with an average wingspan of around and a weight of . It has relatively long, pointed wings for a honeyeater, and very long wings for such a small bird, the development of which has been attributed to its feeding behaviour of flying between shrubs and hovering over flowers. The species is strongly sexually dimorphic. Adult males are black and white, with a black head, neck, wings and upperparts, and a black stripe running down from the centre of the chest to the abdomen, and with a white belly, flanks and under-tail coverts. The female's crown, ear coverts and upper parts are buff brown, scalloped paler, with a pale eyebrow, and the chest is speckled grey-brown grading into a dull white belly. In both male and female the iris is dark brown and the bill and legs blackish brown. Immature birds are similar to the adult female; however, the upper breast and throat tend to be more uniform grey-brown and the base of the bill is paler; they are not distinguishable from adult females at a distance. The black honeyeater is quiet when not breeding, but calls before and during the nesting season, often early in the morning. The calls include a soft metallic \\"chwit, chwit\\"; a louder note, a \\"tieee\\", with a monotonously even pitch and spacing at intervals of several seconds between notes; and a weak \\"peeee\\", usually uttered by breeding males. A soft scolding call is given by both sexes after the young hatch, which may be a call to alert the young they have food. The species is also heard making a bill snap when hawking insects. It is constantly on the move, hovering and hawking when feeding, and chasing intruders at food sources. Gould described its flight as \\"remarkably quick, and performed with zigzag starts\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila, in the Simpson Desert The black honeyeater is a bird of the dry inland of Australia, being generally widespread though scattered in western Queensland and New South Wales to the South Australian border, and occasionally recorded in the Victorian Mallee and Wimmera regions. In South Australia, it occurs in the south-east and it is widespread in the central and northern regions of Western Australia, with some rare sightings in the south near Kalgoorlie. In the Northern Territory, it is widespread around Alice Springs, with some vagrants to the Top End. It is dependent on the presence of the berrigan emu bush (Eremophila longifolia) and related species. As a result, the black honeyeater is found in open woodlands and shrublands of arid and semi-arid regions, as well as in mulga or mallee woodlands, and it is also found in spinifex savanna where flowering shrubs such as grevilleas and paperbarks occur. It has been noted that the black honeyeater is able to locate emu bushes, even when clumps consist of only two or three and are separated by many kilometres of country, which suggests the importance of this plant‚Äìbird association. The black honeyeater is considered to be migratory rather than strictly nomadic, with regular seasonal movements related to flowering of food plants, especially the emu bush. Some move south in the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer, and northwards again in autumn and winter. During severe droughts it has been recorded south of Bendigo and in the Hunter Region. Irruptions (sudden population increases) can occur in some areas after rain or the movement of floodwaters. Breeding has generally been recorded in the drainage basins of Cooper Creek and the Darling River in southwestern Queensland and northwestern New South Wales, as well as in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions in Western Australia. However, favourable conditions may result in it breeding anywhere during an irruption. Behaviour The black honeyeater is usually encountered alone or in pairs, though up to 50 may gather at stands of plants in flower. Breeding The breeding season is from July to December (mostly between August and November), or opportunistically after rain. There is apparently some variation based upon location, with birds in Western Australia nesting earlier, whilst those in Queensland breed as late as March. Black honeyeater populations concentrate for breeding wherever the right plants are in flower and there is an abundance of insects, both essential for feeding the young. At the beginning of the mating season, males can be seen soaring in \\"song flights\\", which consist of a series of zigzagging movements, high into the air, accompanied by constant calling. The birds appear to stiffen themselves, with wings pointed downward, as they rise, while uttering a two-note call. Black honeyeaters gather into loose groups of up to fifty birds during the breeding season, with only several pairs within the group breeding. The males agonistically defend a small breeding territory against members of their own species as well as other honeyeaters. Both members of the pair seem to be involved in selecting the nest site. The nest is usually low on a dead limb or in a fork of a small tree or shrub, though sometimes fallen timber is chosen as the nest site. The female gathers nesting material close to the nest site, while the male is engaged in song flights, and she builds the shallow, open, cup-shaped nest from fine twigs, grass, and other plant material bound with spiderweb, lining it with grass, roots, fibre, horse hair, flowers, or wool. As the young grow, the nest can become flattened to a saucer shape, and may be an almost flat platform by the time the chicks fledge. The female lays two to three eggs, which are long, wide and have an unusual swollen oval shape. The eggs are slightly lustrous, buffy white in colour and dotted with reddish-brown and grey blotches that often appear in a cloud over the larger end of the eggs. Black honeyeater nests are occasionally parasitised by Horsfield's bronze- cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis). The female incubates alone, leaving the eggs exposed for short periods during the day to take insects in the air. When approached, the sitting bird attempts to hide by sinking into the nest and, if unsuccessful in deterring the intruder, will tumble to the ground with outstretched wings, giving weak calls in an effort to lure the intruder away from the nest. While the female is incubating, the male remains on guard at one of several regular vantage points. The incubation period is around sixteen days, and the fledging period approximately eighteen days. On hatching, the young birds' eyes are closed, and they are naked except for tufts of down on the head, nape and back. Both sexes feed and care for the young, taking all the insects for the young birds in the air. At one nest, two small young were fed every ten minutes or so, with the male bringing food three to four times more often than the female. All birds leave the vicinity of the nesting site within a few days of the young fledging. Food and feeding A male feeding in a Jacaranda The black honeyeater feeds on nectar, probing flowers and foliage with its long, fine bill. It is mainly found in the crowns of eucalypts, at clumps of mistletoe or in shrubs, especially emu bushes (Eremophila). Observations over a twelve-month period in South Australia recorded black honeyeaters visiting the flowers of berrigan emu bush, twin- leaf emu bush (Eremophila oppositifolia), lerp mallee (Eucalyptus incrassata), and holly grevillea (Grevillea ilicifolia). The species was also frequently observed hawking for small insects. The black honeyeater hovers around flowers, feeding briefly at each one. It may sometimes form large mixed flocks at food sources, associating with other birds such as pied honeyeaters and white-browed woodswallows (Artamus superciliosus). Like many other honeyeaters, the black honeyeater catches insects in flight. The male, in particular, flies up to a height of to seize an insect in mid-air, and then drops to a regularly used perch. A study of black honeyeaters at seven sites in Western Australia regularly recorded breeding females eating ash from campsite fires and often making repeated visits over a brief period of time. It was noted that the birds seemed attracted to the remote campfire with groups of around six hovering around and landing beside the fire, an activity described as similar to \\"bees buzzing around a honeypot.\\" After pecking at the ash, some of the females foraged for insects, sallying from the foliage of nearby Wheatbelt wandoos (Eucalyptus capillosa) before returning for more ash. The activity of the females approaching the fire ranged from a single peck to sustained feeding for a minute or more. Male birds occasionally landed near the fire, but none were seen to take ash. Well-developed brood patches on the birds mist netted near the fires, suggest that the females take ash around the time of laying, and throughout the incubation and feeding period. Wood ash is rich in calcium and it was hypothesised that the females were eating ash to form medullary bone before egg-laying or to repair a calcium deficit after laying. When other small birds, such as American hummingbirds, were recorded eating calcium-rich ash, bones or shell, it was suggested that the bones of small species may not be able to store enough calcium for egg production. Conservation status Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers, and the species has a sufficiently large range, for the species to be evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, biologist Claire A. Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed a slow and incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat specialists and hence may occupy only a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated. The black honeyeater may be adversely affected by the loss of the emu bush due to grazing and weed control by farmers.

It is endemic to tropical northern Australia.  Taxonomy and systematics  The scientific name for the banded honeyeater is Cissomela pectoralis (Gould, 1841). The holotype was Holotype ANSP 18224 male, Australia: north coast, held in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia. The banded honeyeater was previously placed in the genus Certhionyx, but was moved to the monotypic genus Cissomela after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that the original genus was polyphyletic. The genus name Cissomela (Bonaparte, 1854) means \\"honey magpie\\" from the Greek kissa for 'magpie', thus referring to the black and white colouring, and mela meaning 'honey' for its feeding habits. The specific epithet pectoralis comes from the Latin pectoris for 'breast', referring to the distinctive banded breast of this bird.  Description  The banded honeyeater is a small, pied honeyeater with a distinctive black breast band across white underparts. It has a black back, tail and head, a long curved bill and long legs. It has a wingspan of , the bill measures , the body length is and it weighs .  Behaviour and ecology  The IUCN Red List rating, the Northern Territory Conservation Status and Queensland Conservation Status for this species is Least Concern (LC). The banded honeyeater inhabits tropical grassy woodland, open forests, mangroves and Melaleuca swamps. It feeds on the nectar of eucalypts and some other open flowers, such as Grevilleas, paperbarks and Bauhinias, plus insects. It usually moves in pairs or small groups, but large groups can gather when blossom is plentiful. It is a blossom nomad or can have seasonal movements in various parts of its range, which is restricted to tropical northern Australia.

This species is also known as the black and white honeyeater or western pied honeyeater. It is endemic to Australia and is listed as a vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW). Taxonomy In 1999, taxonomists had placed pied honeyeater (Certhionyx variegatus), banded honeyeater (Cissomela pectoralis) and black honeyeater (Sugomel nigrum) in the genus Certhionyx; however, revised DNA analysis indicates that these species are not closely related.

Christidis and Boles placed the pied honeyeater in the clade Acanthagenys in its own monotypic genus. Description The pied honeyeater has a long curved bill and a small pale- blue patch of bare skin below the eye which is semicircular in males and arc- shaped in females and juveniles. Males are black and white, having a black head, neck and upper parts, a white lower rump and upper tail, black wings with a white stripe, and white underparts with a black tipped tail.

The call of the pied honeyeater has been described as a \\"mournful whistle, resembling that of the little grassbird (Megalurus gramineus)\\". North, A 1909, Nests and eggs of birds found breeding in Australia and Tasmania, 2nd edn, F. W. White, Sydney. During the breeding season it utters a \\"melancholy piping note\\".Carter, T 1902b, North-western notes, Emu, pp. 126‚Äì128. A superficially similar honeyeater is the black honeyeater, (Sugomel nigrum). It has a different call, is smaller, with a finer bill, shorter tail and lacks the bare eye-patch. Males of this species also have a distinctive stripe down the center of the chest and abdomen, while females have plainer wings and less streaking on the breast. Distribution and habitat In the early 1900s, this species was \\"widely distributed, principally over the southern half of the continent\\". Data mapping by [Gannon, 1962] shows occurrences primarily across central and western NSW, the arid interior, and the eastern parts of South Australia. Birdlife Australia Atlas project data between 1998 and 2014 indicates that the pied honeyeater is found principally in a band below approximately 18 ¬∞ S, which extends roughly from central Queensland, central NSW and central Victoria in the east and across to the Western Australian coastline [Birdlife Australia, 2014]. Movements Widely considered as nomadic and categorized by Keast as a \\"desert nomad\\", the pied honeyeater has more recently been found to be both sedentary‚Äìresident and irruptive, turning up occasionally in numbers far outside its normal range in tandem with heavy rains following drought periods. Burbridge, A & Fuller P 2007, Gibson Desert birds: Responses to drought and plenty, Emu 107. 126‚Äì134. Movements are poorly understood with no apparent pattern to occurrence or numbers in an area and limited knowledge of actual movements. Occurrences may coincide with the flowering of the emu- bush (Eremophila) [Gannon, 1962] Shelly, D, Baun, R & Kidd, S 2008, The importance of Yapunyah Eucalyptus ochrophloia as a food source for the Pied Honeyeater Certhionyx variegatus in Far West New South Wales, Australian Zoologist, vol. 34 no.4, pp. 561-3.[Read, 2008], and perhaps the need to secure minimal breeding requirements via an abundance of insects. Migration and seasonal movements occur, Birds Australia Western Australia 2005a, Birds of the Mingenew Shire, Birds Australia, Nov 2005. particularly in coastal north-western Australia. \\"The pied honeyeater is one of the commonest winter visitors, occurring in great numbers immediately after the first heavy rain\\". There are some instances of residency,Birds Australia 2005b, Birdwatching around Kalbarri: Number 07a in a series of Bird Guides of Western Australia, Nov 2005, revised Sep 2009. while occurrence has been irregularly observed at the periphery of its range. The pied honeyeater appears to be largely independent in the use of free surface water; its distribution within the landscape is less consistent along gradients in relation to distance from water. Schneider, N & Griesser, M 2009, Influence and value of different water regimes on avian species richness in arid inland Australia, Biodivers Conserv, vol. 18, pp.457-471. Habitat The pied honeyeater is found in the arid and semi-arid zones, on the sandhills of inland plains, inland ranges, granite outcrops , and also on the coastal sandhills of Western Australia. It frequents shrublands and woodlands with the former dominated by emu bush (Eremophila spp.) and grevilleas, and the latter predominantly by mulga . Habitat may include a scattering of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) along watercourses, and Casuarina and Myoporum along dry watercourses and dry salt-lakes. Pied honeyeaters also inhabit spinifex-dominated grasslands within scattered areas of mulga (Acacia aneura), Casuarina, and bloodwood (Corymbia terminalis).Chapman, G., (2014) Pers. comm. 17 October 2014. http://www.graemechapman.com.au/index.php Behaviour There is little known about the social organization and behaviour of this species, in part due to its erratic movements, and also because individuals are widely characterized as very nervous, always on the move, very shy, \\"quick on the wing\\" MacGillivray, W 1910, The region of the Barrier Range: An oologist's holiday, Emu, vol. 10 no.1, pp. 16‚Äì34. and very timid [Burgess, 1946]. Birds are often seen singly or in pairs. However, early Australian records note movements of pied honeyeaters in constant flocks, \\"flying against the wind...in flocks at times of fifty or more\\" Carter, T 1902a, Exploration of the North-West Cape, Emu, pp. 77‚Äì84.and in larger flocks of several hundred. Seasonal flocks have been observed flying in the company of black honeyeaters (Sugomel nigrum), crimson chats (Epthianura tricolor), black-faced woodswallows (Artamus cinereus) and masked woodswallows (A. personatus). The pied honeyeater has been observed feeding in the company of black honeyeaters (S. nigrum), \\"greenies\\" ( Ptilotis penicillata) and yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). During breeding displays, pairs sometimes fly into the air together and \\"literally loop and loop\\" [Burgess, 1946, p. 392] and a male may soar \\"singing, into the air from the top of a tree, and suddenly [drop], always turning over backward in its descent\\". Males advertising territorial display will, similarly, fly singing vertically into the air. Actions in the air appear similar to the black honeyeater [Burgess, 1946] and flight is said to resemble that of the critically endangered regent honeyeater (Anthochaera phrygia). There is little information on feeding behaviour, although Shelly et al. note that the pied honeyeater is rarely observed feeding in mixed flocks. Information on agonistic behavior is also limited. However, territorial calling and aerial displays have been noted, while feigning of lameness or a broken wing, if disturbed off a nest containing young, has also been recorded. Diet and foraging The pied honeyeater feeds primarily on nectar, but also eats insects, fruit and seeds. It utilizes its long bill to explore flowers and foliage of trees and shrubs, especially Emu bush (e.g., Eremophila longifolia, E. sturtii), and various eucalypts (e.g., Eucalyptus largiflorens, E. ochrophloia), and Grevilleas. It has been observed feeding in lignum (Muehlenbeckia cunninghamii), flowering turpentine and tobacco-bush (Nicotiana glauca). It also feeds on the seeds of harlequin fuchsia-bush (Eremophila duttonii) and turpentine (Eremophila sturtii). Stomach content analysis has revealed \\"grape-like\\" seeds, berries, grit, and insects and their larvae (e.g., Coleoptera and Lepidoptera). Lea, A & Gray, J 1936, The food of Australian birds: An analysis of the stomach contents. By the late A. H. Lea, Adelaide and J. T. Gray, Orroroo, South Australia, Emu, vol.35 no.4, p. 264. In the Australian desert, the Meliphagidae are highly dependent on free water, with the pied honeyeater being classified as a \\"summer drinker\\". It has been recorded drinking on more than half of the days on which the temperature exceeded 25 degrees C. Fisher, C, Lindgren, E & Dawson, W 1972, Drinking patterns and behavior of Australian desert birds in relation to their ecology and abundance, Condor vol. 74 no. 2, pp. 111‚Äì136. Reproduction North, A 1909, p. 90 Pied honeyeater nest June and the five following months constitute the usual breeding season of this species, nests with eggs being more frequently found in August and September. However, there have been examples of breeding in March in central and northern Australia, usually following heavy rains. Both sexes contribute with nest construction, incubation of eggs and caring for the young. Nests can be built and eggs laid within 3 days [Burgess, 1946] and may be built in low shrubs or trees, including mulga, cork bark (Hakea lorea), sandalwood (Santalum) or on top of thick creepers, about above the ground. The nest is generally an open, deep, saucer-shaped, well- made structure constructed from twigs or short grass stems, e.g. spinifex, bound with spider-web, which may be placed on thin twigs at the end of a branch or at the junction of several thin horizontal leafy stems and suspended by the rim. Egg sizes are approximately in width to in length. Shape varies from oval to rounded and elongate oval. The shell is close-grained, smooth and usually lustreless with a dull white base colour, over which is evenly distributed freckles and spots of blackish-brown, with underlying markings of dull bluish-grey. Competition There is limited information on competition and predation; however, the pied honeyeater is sometimes harassed in tree canopies by white-plumed honeyeaters (Ptilotula penicillatus) and yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). Diurnal avian predation would seem to be one of the primary selective pressures tending to restrict all but essential drinking in desert birds, primarily that by the brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus) and Australian hobby (Falco longipennis). Predation and competition aspects may be a useful area for further research on the pied honeyeater. Conservation Conservation status {  -  FEDERAL: Secure  QLD: Secure  SA:Secure  NT: Secure -  NSW: Vulnerable  VIC: Secure  WA: Secure  TAS: Not present } The pied honeyeater is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its extremely large range and apparent stability of population size; however, population size has not been quantified. It has been seen to be subject to threatening processes that generally act at the landscape scale (e.g. habitat loss or degradation) rather than at distinct, definable locations. The former Office of Environment & Heritage was developing a targeted approach for managing such landscape species, but the functions of that office now fall under the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. It is unclear whether any studies are ongoing. Identified management actions in the plan included encouragement of the protection of rich nectar-producing patches of woodland and shrubs from stock and goats, development of educational and promotional information to generate conservation interest and status assessments. Environment & Heritage NSW 2011, Channel country: Biodiversity, NSW Department of Environment & Heritage. Targeted management strategies were also being implemented via the NSW Murray Biodiversity Management Plan.Murray Catchment Management Authority 2012, New South Wales Murray Biodiversity Management Plan: A guide to terrestrial biodiversity investment priorities in the central and eastern NSW Murray catchment , Murray Catchment Management Authority, 2012. The mobility of nomadic birds makes it difficult to gain a qualitative impression of population changes, and while migrants and nomads may give the illusion of abundance as large flocks aggregate at rich patches of food, they are not spread evenly across the landscape and their total numbers are often fewer than appears.

The band supported acts such as The Kooks, Babyshambles and The Kaiser Chiefs. They took their name from the Radiohead song ‚ÄòRipcord‚Äô with an added 'h'. The band were signed to 1965 Records and released two singles - Lock Up Your Daughters (And Throw Away The Key) & Backstabber, the first of which was a limited edition single of only 1,000 copies. History BBC & 1965 It was not long before Ripchord had raised enough money from performing to record some demos of their songs at Mad Hat Recording Studios in Wolverhampton. These demos were sold at gigs and one was sent off to a search for the best young band in the West Midlands in 2005. This search was known as the School Of Rock and as made by the BBC. The search was eventually narrowed down to the six bands that celebrity judges, including Roy Wood and Janice Long, selected. The show concluded with a vote for who the public felt was the best band. Ripchord won this vote and gained the prize of funding for more demos and filming a music video. This gave Ripchord even higher exposure and the BBC asked Ripchord to play at a Children In Need concert at a later date. It was at roughly the same time that one of Ripchord's demos was put on a CD featuring unsigned bands that was given to James Endeacott, the man responsible for signing The Libertines. Endeacott liked Ripchord's song and went to see them in Wolverhampton only to gain more interest with them. At the time they met he was just leaving Rough Trade but was about to set up his own record label 1965 Records. He asked Ripchord to sign to his new label to which they all agreed after no moment's hesitation. The band are now defunct. Beal is currently a member of Splashh. Members Phil Wallbank ‚Äì Lead Singer, Rhythm Guitarist James Sullivan ‚Äì Lead Guitarist Tom Beal ‚Äì Bassist Roz Duignan-Pearson - Drums Releases So far Ripchord have released two singles. The first single, Lock Up Your Daughters (And Throw Away The Key) was a limited edition vinyl with only 1,000 copies made. The single was recorded in Elevator Studios in Liverpool and produced by legendary producer Ian Broudie. It was mixed by Steve Harris in RAK Studios, London. They received a considerable amount of airplay on Radio 1 for a limited release. and their video was shown to a large extent on MTV2. The video for the single was shot in London and features Ripchord giving out flyers promoting their own single to passers by. The second single, Backstabber, was released on CD and limited edition vinyl. It was recorded at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool and was mixed by James Lewis at Livingstone Studios in London. Ripchord received glowing reviews from the NME about this single, calling it ‚Äòthe best riff this week by far‚Äô. The video for this single featured a much stronger plot line to its predecessor and was filmed in Ripchord's hometown of Wolverhampton. The shots in which the band are seen performing live in this video are filmed one of the first venues they played in, The Varsity.

Biography   Early life  Grubb was born in Hampstead, England,England & Wales Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915 the son of an Anglican vicar.Once Caught No Escape: My Life Story, hereafter OCNE, by Norman Grubb; Blowing Rock, NC: Zerubbabel Press, 2005, pp. 20-21; Originally published by Lutterworth Press and the Christian Literature Crusade in 1969. He was educated at Marlborough College, an English Public SchoolOCNE, pp. 30-40 before joining the British Army as a lieutenant in World War I.OCNE, pp. 45-46 He received the Military Cross for meritorious action.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, pp. 265-266 After the war, in which he was wounded in one leg,OCNE, p. 56 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge.OCNE, pp. 72-76 Later he married Pauline Studd, the daughter of the famous British cricketer and missionary to Africa C.T. Studd.OCNE, pp. 71-72; 95-98 He left for the Belgian Congo with Pauline in 1920 to follow in the footsteps of his father- in-law, having not yet completed his final term at Cambridge.OCNE, p. 98  Missionary work and beliefs  Despite having a Christian upbringing it was only at the age of eighteen that Grubb seriously began to consider what it meant to be a Christian.OCNE, p. 49. It was a conversation with a family friend that challenged him to think more deeply about his faith, and from that point on he became committed to evangelistic work. While recovering from his bullet wound in 1917 Grubb was handed a tract about the Heart of Africa Mission and the work of C.T. Studd in the Belgian Congo. After reading this tract he felt a calling to join Studd in his missionary activities.OCNE, p. 69. Before setting out for Africa, however, Grubb studied for a while at Cambridge,OCNE, pp. 72-75. where he had the vision for the Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (IVF) (now the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship) whose primary goal was the sharing of the Christian message with other students. Before finishing his studies at Cambridge Grubb met Pauline Studd and became engaged to her.OCNE, p. 98 During their engagement, however, a dispute arose between them regarding Norman telling her that he loved God more than he loved her. The disagreement almost resulted in Pauline calling off the wedding.OCNE, pp. 95-97. Fortunately the two were reconciled to one another when Pauline came to accept Grubb‚Äôs dedication to serving his God, even though it meant that she would have to take second place in her husband‚Äôs life.OCNE, p. 98. In 1920 the newlyweds left for the Congo. They spent ten years there, working with C.T. Studd in evangelising the Africans.OCNE, Part III, pp. 103ff. While there he translated the New Testament into Bangala.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, pp. 265-266. He was also struck by the words of Galatians 2:20: ‚ÄúI am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth within me, and the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.‚ÄùOCNE, pp. 115-116, 122. This verse was to become central to his philosophy. The kernel of his Christian belief was Jesus Christ‚Äôs teaching that He is the vine and we are the branches (John 15),OCNE, p. 122. and that Christians are new creations in Him and therefore exist in union with him. Before C.T. Studd‚Äôs death in 1931 Norman and Pauline returned to England where they ran the mission from its London headquarters. In the book Samuel Rees Howells: A Life of Intercession, Norman explains what happened when C.T. Studd died: ‚ÄúWhen C.T. Studd died in 1931 we were in a helpless condition. That month we had thirty-five missionaries and we had one pound a week for that month. That was all we had! People said to us, 'You‚Äôd better give up. Your founder is dead, the mission is so weak, give up.' But we learned, mainly through Rees Howells, to change our whole attitude and the Lord told us not to give up. The Lord talked to us about going to the world and we laughed. Here we were two missionaries at home, thirty-five starving missionaries on the field and the Lord is speaking to us about going to the world! How does anything get done? By faith of course! Faith is the ability, inspired by the Spirit, to believe something offered to you. It isn‚Äôt I doing it, it is Him doing it.‚ÄùSamuel Rees Howells: A Life of Intercession After Studd‚Äôs death in 1931, it was learned that he had left a letter appointing Grubb as president of the ministry he had founded, World Evangelisation Crusade (W.E.C., WEC International), in place of himself. Grubb however thought it would be better to be called secretary instead.OCNE, p. 163. W.E.C. grew from one mission field with 35 workers to a worldwide mission operating in over 40 fields with thousands of workers from around the world, all living according to the principle that all needs will be supplied by God with no appeals to man. The mission continues to this day under the name of Worldwide Evangelization for Christ.  Writing  During his time as the General Secretary of WEC, Grubb began writing. To begin with he produced tracts and magazines for the mission, and then in 1933 he published a biography of C.T. Studd: C. T. Studd: Cricketer & Pioneer. After this came a string of other books, including his autobiography Once Caught, No Escape, and the pamphlet The Key to Everything. Other books include Continuous Revival, Touching the Invisible, Rees Howells' Intercessor, Modern Viking, Law of Faith, \\"The Liberating Secret\\", The Deep Things of God, God Unlimited, Spontaneous You, Who Am I?, and Yes I Am. Three books of Grubb's letters, including Knight of Faith, Vols. 1 & 2, and My Dear C.U.M.B.: Norman Grubb's Letters To The Cambridge University Missionary Band 1922-1989, have been published.  Retirement  Upon retiring from the position of International Secretary for WEC in 1965, he travelled, mostly around England and the United States, preaching Paul‚Äôs \\"mystery of the gospel, which is Christ in you\\" in churches and conferences and to anyone who would listen. He carried on this work until his death.  Death  Grubb died on 15 December 1993, at the age of 98, at his home in Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania.

Spiegel was born in Amsterdam and is seen as a forerunner to the Golden Age of Vondel, Hooft and Huygens. He is the strongest candidate for the unknown author of the first book on Dutch grammar, the Twe- spraack (Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst), which appeared in 1584. (In the past it was thought to be by his friend, Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert.) He was a rederijker and founding member of the rhetorician's chamber called the Egelantier. On ethics, he wrote \\"Hertspiegel\\" (a summary of a more complex work), and a short play, \\"Numa\\", on the Roman king Numa Pompilius. His sister Geertrui married the Alkmaar regent Pieter Adriaansz Pauw, his sister Mary was one of the founders of the Amsterdam Maagdenhuis, a Catholic girl's orphanage, and his brother Jan became one of the first regents of Amsterdam after the Alteratie. Spiegel was married twice, first to Bregtje van der Berg and Dieuwertje van Marken.Spiegel in Van der Aa When his children contracted chicken pox, his wife kept him away because he had not had it in his youth, but he could not bear being separated from them and thus became ill and died of the chicken pox in Alkmaar, aged 62. His daughter Geertrui married the Amsterdam lawyer Ysbrand van der Hem, and his sons were later the founders of the Amsterdam regency families Backer and Lestevenon. References Bibliography *A.

Biography He was born in Rudolstadt the son of Prince Albert of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and his wife Princess Augusta of Solms-Braunfels (1804‚Äì1865). Princess Augusta was the daughter of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Solms-Braunfels (1770‚Äì1814) and his wife Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg- Strelitz (1778‚Äì1841), the daughter of Grand Duke Charles II. Following the death of his uncle Friedrich G√ºnther on June 28, 1867 his father Albert ascended the throne thereby making Georg the heir apparent with the title Hereditary Prince. His father died on November 26, 1869 two years after ascending the throne, with Georg becoming the new sovereign prince. During his reign the North German Confederation was dissolved following the victory of the Kingdom of Prussia backed by states of the confederation in the Franco- Prussian War over the Second French Empire. As a result, on January 18, 1871 the King of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor and so Prince Georg no longer ruled over an independent state as Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt became a state of the German Empire and therefore Prince Georg was subordinate to the German Emperor. Personal life Prince Georg was engaged to Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, his second cousin once removed and stepdaughter of his cousin Grand Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She broke of engagement in order to marry Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia. After that he never married and following his death in Rudolstadt he was succeeded as prince by his first cousin once removed G√ºnther. He was buried in Stadtkirche in Rudolstadt.

History  Ed Levine, current president, attended the Newhouse School at Syracuse University where his love for radio began. After serving as program director for the college radio station, Mr. Levine and two classmates started Syracuse‚Äôs first live FM radio station in 1978. In 1989, the first Galaxy station, WKLL was launched by the current CEO, Ed Levine, and his business partner, Bob Raide. WKLL was named for Ed and wife Pam‚Äôs then-19-month-old daughter Lauren. In the 1990s, Galaxy launched additional stations in Syracuse and Utica. In 2001, the headquarters was moved from Bridgeport to a new building in Armory Square, located in downtown Syracuse. This building has multiple street level studios allowing people to see the DJs at work. WKLL remains owned by Galaxy to this day. In 2016 Galaxy moved their Utica studios (WKLL, WUMX, WTLB and WRNY) from Washington Mills to Downtown Utica inside the brand new Landmarc building (the old HSBC location) and renamed it Galaxy Media in 2018. Inside their new location the walls on the side of the street for each studio are made entirely of glass allowing people to see DJs at work similar to the \\"Good Morning America\\" Studios. Galaxy divested itself of its Albany, New York cluster and swapped several stations in a multi-owner deal that included Clear Channel Communications in Utica/Rome 2007. In October 2016, Galaxy Communications (through Galaxy II Media, LLC) agreed to acquire Gamma Broadcasting's stations in Berkshire County, Massachusetts for $3.15 million: WBEC, WBEC-FM, and WUPE in Pittsfield, WNAW and WUPE-FM in North Adams, and WSBS in Great Barrington. In 2018, Galaxy Communications rebranded to Galaxy Media company and brought aboard 10 new investors to buy out the shares that had been owned by a private investment firm and help the company reduce debt. Those investors are local people including Ed Levine's long-time friend and Syracuse University basketball coach Jim Boeheim. Additionally in 2018, Townsquare Media acquired the classic rock radio station WOUR-FM 96.9 in Utica from Galaxy Media in Q4.

In 1941, a nationwide frequency reassignment took place by the Federal government which assigned WAZL to 1450 kc. where it stayed until 1948 when the station switched to its current broadcast frequency of 1490 kc.. WAZL was an affiliate of the NBC and Mutual radio networks during its early history. From 1932 to 1994, studios were on the seventh floor in the Hazleton National Bank Building at 101 West Broad Street. The station has struggled in recent years, going silent for a time until Route 81 Radio bought the station and put it back on the air in 2004 as a Full-Service operation serving the local Hazleton community. In mid-July 2008, Route 81 Radio fell into financial difficulty and went into foreclosure. WS2K Acquisition, originally a 50% owner in Route 81 Radio, took over the license. Soon afterwards in August 2008, Hazleton Radio, Inc., a locally-owned corporation, took over management of the station under a LMA. On August 20, 2009, the Hazleton Standard Speaker reported the sale of WAZL to locally-owned Panorama Magazine. On April 25, 2011 the FCC approved the sale to WAZL Partners, LLP, switching to the music format to Classic Rock, before finally settling on Hot Adult Contemporary. In October 2012, WAZL entered into a local marketing agreement with KMCS Broadcasting, LLC, who started stunting Christmas music on November 1, 2012 and then broadcasting an adult hits format on January 1, 2013. This sale fell through in April 2013. In May 2013, Geos Communications began an LMA with WAZL, changed the format to mainstream country, and filed with the FCC to purchase the station. On July 15, 2013, Geos Communications completed its purchase of WAZL, at a price of $30,000. Geos Communications was also the licensee of WGMF/WZMF (Gem 104) in Tunkhannock/Nanticoke, PA. On October 23, 2015, WAZL was sold to JMJ Radio, owners of WQOR AM 750 in Olyphant, broadcasting a Catholic religious format. On December 17, 2015, WAZL switched from a simulcast of classic hits-formatted WGMF 1460 AM to a simulcast of Catholic religious-formatted WQOR 750 AM Olyphant, as a result of a sale to J.M.J. Radio, Inc. The sale took effect on January 4, 2016.

Her work is often associated with Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism.Sterne, Hedda, Sarah L Eckhardt, Josef Helfenstein, and Lawrence Rinder. Uninterrupted flux : Hedda Sterne, a retrospective. Champaign, Ill.: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2006.  Early life and education  Sterne was born as Hedwig Lindenberg in Bucharest, Romania, on August 4, 1910. She was the daughter of Jewish parents Eugenie (n√©e Wexler) and Simon Lindenberg, a language teacher. Her older brother and only sibling, Edouard Lindenberg (1908-1973), would become a prominent conductor in Paris.Eckhardt, 2006 As a young child, Sterne and her brother were educated in music and languages. In addition to Romanian, Sterne was taught to read German, French, and English. She would recall the importance of German philosophy texts and art history books in her development as an artist. Initially encouraged to study piano, Sterne eventually succeeded in convincing her parents to allow her to study art instead.Oral history interview with Hedda Sterne, 1981 December 17. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral- history-interview-hedda-sterne-13262 With the encouragement of Max Hermann Maxy, whom Sterne recalled as a student of her father's, she began formal training in 1918. Sterne's first art teacher was Maxy's former professor at the Bucharest National University of Arts, the sculptor Frederic Storck. In 1919, Sterne's father Simon died and her mother remarried. By 1921, Sterne was attending the Institutul de Domni≈üoare Choisy-Mang√¢ru, a private girl's school in Bucharest. In the late 1920s, Sterne traveled regularly to Vienna, where she took classes in ceramics at the Kunsthistorisches Museum. In 1929 she enrolled at the University of Bucharest where she studied art history and philosophy with various notable intellectuals, including Tudor Vianu, Mircea Florian, and Nae Ionescu. In 1932 she married Friederich (Fritz) Stern (1905-1982; later known as Frederick (Fred) Stafford) and discontinued her formal education.  Early career and Surrealism  In addition to her early work in the studio of Frederic Storck, Sterne was one of several young artists in Bucharest working in the studio of Dada-cofounder and Surrealist painter Marcel Janco, who had returned to Bucharest from Switzerland and France in 1921. Sterne became an active member of Bucharest's thriving avant-garde communities of artists and writers, and in this way, as she would recall, she \\"grew up with Surrealism.\\" Among her closest friends were Constructivist and Surrealist artist Victor Brauner, his brother Th√©odore Brauner and their family; painters Jules Perahim and Medi Wexler, and Wexler's future husband, the surrealist poet Gheorghe Dinu. Beginning in the late 1920s and following her marriage to Fritz Stern in 1932, Sterne traveled frequently between Bucharest and Paris, where she studied briefly in the ateliers of Fernand L√©ger and Andr√© Lhote, and at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re.Simon, Joan. Patterns of thought: Hedda Sterne. Art in America, 2007. Often reconnecting with Victor Brauner in Paris in the 1930s, Sterne closely followed developments in Surrealism and attended exhibitions. She was particularly drawn to the Surrealist practice of automatism and by the late 1930s had developed her own unique method of constructing automatic collages. Some of these works were included in the Association Artistique Les Surind√©pendants' 11th Exposition du Salon des Surind√©pendants at the Porte de Versailles, where they drew the attention of Hans Arp. The following year, her work was shown in the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants' 50th annual Salon des Ind√©pendants.  World War II and emigration  In the summer of 1939, Sterne and her husband returned to Bucharest from France for the last time. With the outbreak of World War II in September, the couple began to prepare to leave Europe for the United States. However, Sterne did not accompany her husband in the spring of 1940 when Fritz Stern left for New York. Instead, she remained in Bucharest with her family, where in January 1941 she was witness to the Bucharest pogrom and increasing political unrest. After trying for several months to acquire all the necessary visas to leave Romania for the U.S., Sterne finally departed Lisbon for New York aboard the S.S.Excambion on October 17, 1941.  Arrival in New York  Hedda Sterne arrived in New York in late October 1941, where she was reunited with her estranged husband. The couple soon after changed their last name from Stern to Stafford. However, by late 1942 she was exhibiting her work under the name \\"Hedda Sterne.\\" By adding an \\"e\\" to the end of her former married name, she maintained a connection to the name she had exhibited under in Europe. In late 1941, Sterne established a studio and apartment on East 50th Street, nearby Peggy Guggenheim's home on Beekman Place. The two became close friends, and through Guggenheim, Sterne met and became reacquainted with many of the Surrealist artists she had known in Paris, including Andr√© Breton, Marcel Duchamp, and Max Ernst. Around this time Sterne also met and became close friends with the author Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry. She would later play a critical role in advising Saint-Exup√©ry to use his own drawings to illustrate his book The Little Prince. In 1942, Sterne was included in the seminal exhibition The First Papers of Surrealism, which opened on October 14 at the Whitelaw Reid Mansion in midtown Manhattan. By 1943, Sterne was regularly shown at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery in New York, including the 1943 Exhibition by 31 Women. In February 1943, Sterne met fellow artist and Romanian refugee Saul Steinberg, whom she would marry on October 11, 1944, after her divorce from Stafford was finalized. By the end of 1943, Sterne had also begun her nearly 40-year collaboration with gallerist Betty Parsons, who gave Sterne her first solo exhibition in the U.S. at Wakefield Gallery in November. When the Betty Parsons Gallery opened in 1947, Sterne was among the first group of artists represented.  The New York School and the \\"Irascibles\\"  Hedda Sterne was included in many major exhibitions of the New York School in the 1940s and 1950s, including Stable Gallery's Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture. During the 1950s, Sterne's notable contribution to Abstract Expressionism came in the form of her use of commercial spray paint to depict motion and light in her abstract renderings of roads, highways, and cityscapes. Pictured with The \\"Irascibles\\" (in back)In 1950, Sterne was a key participant in the \\"Artists' Sessions at Studio 35,\\" a discussion about the modern art scene in New York and the aims of the artists. In addition to Sterne, speakers included Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, Adolph Gottlieb, David Hare, Louise Bourgeois, and David Smith, among others. Following the two-day session, on May 20, 1950, Sterne was among 18 painters and ten sculptors who signed an open letter to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art to protest aesthetically conservative group-exhibition juries. The subsequent media coverage of the open letter to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a now iconic group photograph, gave notoriety to a group of artists including Sterne. After the publication of the letter in the New York Times on May 22, 1950, an editorial in The Herald Tribune of May 23, 1950 dubbed the group the \\"Irascible 18\\" and attacked the artists for \\"distortion of fact\\" in claiming the Metropolitan had \\"contempt\\" for modern painting.\\"The Irascible Eighteen\\". The New York Herald Tribune. 23 May 1950. Life magazine's coverage of the protest in their January 15, 1951 edition included a photograph by Nina Leen.\\"IRASCIBLE GROUP OF ADVANCED ARTISTS LED FIGHT AGAINST SHOW\\". Life: 34‚Äì38. 15 January 1951. Retrieved 27 November 2012. 15 of the letter's 28 signees arrived for the photo shoot: Theodoros Stamos, Jimmy Ernst, Barnett Newman, James Brooks, Mark Rothko, Richard Pousette-Dart, William Baziotes, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt, and Hedda Sterne. Although the sculptors Louise Bourgeois and Mary Callery were among the signers of the letter, Hedda Sterne was the only woman in the photograph. This singularity made her name known to many who were unfamiliar with her work; as she remarked near the end of her life, \\"I am known more for that darn photo than for 80 years of work.\\"Schwabsky, Barry (May 25, 2015). \\"Inside Out\\". The Nation: 27‚Äì30.  Mature career  In 1963, Sterne was granted a Fulbright Fellowship in painting, and spent more than a year working in Venice. Returning to New York in 1964, Sterne eschewed pressure to create a consistent and \\"marketable\\" style of artwork. She would express aversion to the idea of creating a \\"career\\" as an artist, preferring instead to follow her own path of expression and discovery. Her work of the 1960s and forward is often regarded as a progression of \\"series,\\" following Sterne's ongoing and developing interests in visual perception, semiotics, existentialism, and meditation. Though Sterne began to disengage socially from the art world and lead an increasingly private life in the 1960s, she continued to be involved in many exhibitions with Betty Parsons Gallery, CDS Gallery, and others. In 1977, her first retrospective exhibition was held at the Montclair Art Museum. In 1985, her second retrospective, \\"Hedda Sterne: Forty Years\\" was held at the Queens Museum. In November 1992 she met the art dealer Philippe Briet, and began a sustainable friendship which led to several projects until his death in February 1997. In October 1994, Briet introduced writer Michel Butor to Hedda Sterne, which began their collaboration on a book published in September 1995, La R√©volution dans l'Arboretum. In 2006, her third retrospective exhibition, \\"Uninterrupted Flux: Hedda Sterne; A Retrospective\\" was held at the Krannert Art Museum. Sterne was a prolific artist who maintained a daily practice of art-making throughout much of her career. She continued to create new work in her 80s and 90s, even while affected by macular degeneration. By 1998 she could no longer paint, but continued to draw. Between 2004 and 2008, Sterne suffered two strokes, which progressively affected her vision and movement. Hedda Sterne died on April 8, 2011, at the age of 100.  Relationship with Saul Steinberg  Hedda Sterne and Saul Steinberg met in February 1943. Both were Romanian Jews and recent emigrants from Bucharest, though they had not known each other in Europe. Soon after their meeting, Steinberg left New York as an ensign in the US Naval Reserve. He spent the remainder of 1943 and much of 1944 stationed in China, India, North Africa and Italy, providing pictorial propaganda, primarily for the OSS's division of Morale Operations. Sterne and Steinberg maintained correspondence while Steinberg was stationed abroad, much of which has been archived in the Hedda Sterne Papers at the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art and in the Saul Steinberg Papers at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. In 1944, Sterne agreed to marry Steinberg on his return and traveled to Reno, Nevada to secure a divorce from her first husband. Sterne and Steinberg were married in New York on October 11, 1944. Life Magazine featured a profile of the couple in their August 27, 1951 issue, titled \\"Steinberg and Sterne: Romanian-Born Cartoonist and Artist-Wife Ambush the World with Pen and Paintbrush.\\" Sterne and Steinberg lived together in New York until 1960, when they separated. However, they maintained a close friendship and remained married until Steinberg's death in 1999. Awards Sterne was awarded second prize at the Art Institute of Chicago Annual in 1957. In 1963, she was granted a Fulbright Fellowship, and studied in Venice. In 1967, her work won first prize at the Art Institute of Newport Annual. The American Academy of Arts & Letters awarded her a \\"Childe Hassam Purchase Award\\" in 1971, and a \\"Hassam and Speicher Purchase Fund Award\\" in 1984.Portraits. Lee Ault & Company, New York, N. Y.. October 15 - November 8, 1975 In 1999, the French Minister of Culture awarded Sterne Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Artistic style Sterne never liked to define her art or herself into any group socially or artistically. In Eleanor Munro's book Originals: American Women Artists, Sterne remarked: > I believe ... that isms and other classifications are misleading and > diminishing. What entrances me in art is what cannot be entrapped in words. Grace Glueck wrote: > Hedda Sterne views her widely varied works more as \\"in flux\\" than as > definitive statements. She has maintained a stubborn independence from > styles and trends, including Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism ... > Although she never developed a signature style, Ms. Sterne's explorations > have produced a small universe of evocative images.Glueck, Grace. Hedda > Sterne.The New York Times. March 10, 2006. Legacy Sterne has been often overlooked in art historical narratives of the post-war American art scene. At the time of her death, possibly the last surviving artist of the first generation of the New York School, Hedda Sterne viewed her widely varied works more as in flux than as definitive statements. In 2006 the art historian Josef Helfenstein wrote: > From the very beginning of her outstanding but unknown career, Sterne > maintained an individual profile in the face of Jackson Pollock, Willem de > Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman, all of whom she knew personally. > Her independence reflected an immense artistic and personal integrity.

The start of the Cold War saw tensions rise in Korea and March 15, 1951 the 512th activated to support the military actions in the Korean conflict. Shortly thereafter, the 512th was inactivated at New Castle. Need for reserve troop carrier groups During the first half of 1955, the Air Force began detaching Air Force Reserve squadrons from their parent wing locations to separate sites. The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. Continental Air Command (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States. When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Although this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 Activation of 913th Troop Carrier Group As a result, the 913th Troop Carrier Group was established at Willow Grove Naval Air Station, Pennsylvania on 11 February 1963, as the headquarters for the 327th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since July 1958.Maurer, pp. 12‚Äì13 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 327th. The group's mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations. The 913th was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 512th Troop Carrier Wing in 1963, the others being the 912th Troop Carrier Group also at Willow Grove, and the 914th Troop Carrier Group at Niagara Falls International Airport, New York. Redesignation as 913th Tactical Airlift Group The 913th was redesignated as the 913th Tactical Airlift Group (913 TAG) and performed air transportation for airborne forces, airdrops, , and extraction delivery of equipment and supplies, as well as airlift of personnel and cargo. During the Vietnam War the group also helped train Republic of Vietnam Air Force C-119 aircrews in 1967 and ferried aircraft to Southeast Asia in March 1968 and to Taiwan in January 1969. In 1970, the 913th transitioned from the C-119 to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Beginning in 1977 the 913th participated in rotational \\"Coronet Oak\\" operations in the Panama Canal Zone flying airlift in support of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) at Howard AFB. In addition, it has performed humanitarian airlift and supported contingency operations worldwide, including operations in Southwest Asia and the Balkans. Redesignation as 913th Airlift Group and 913th Airlift Wing With the disestablishment of the 913th's active duty gaining command, the Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1992, the 913th was redesignated as 913th Airlift Group (913 AG), with the Air Mobility Command (AMC). From 1993 to 1997, the 913th's gaining command was temporarily changed to Air Combat Command (ACC), until a USAF reorganization returned the unit back to AMC. In 1994, the 913 AG was redesignated as the 913th Airlift Wing (913 AW) as part of an Air Force-wide initiative to redesignate all Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard flying units with unit-assigned aircraft as wings. The 913 AW was inactivated on 1 October 2007 under budget considerations. Reference The 913th AW was not closed under the 2005 BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Act), with its Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft redistributed to other active duty Air Force and Air Force Reserve airlift units. Associate unit The unit was reactivated as the 913th Airlift Group at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas and an activation ceremony was held on 13 July 2014. The group replaced Detachment 1, Twenty-Second Air Force, which had been established at Little Rock in March 2011. The 913th Airlift Group is the first C-130 classic associate unit in the U.S. Air Force. Upon activation, it was associated with the 314th Airlift Wing of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the 189th Airlift Wing (180 AW) of the Arkansas Air National Guard in performing the crew training mission for the C-130. In October 2013, however, its predecessor had already begun transitioning to the combat airlift mission in association with the 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW) of the Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 913th currently flies active duty Lockheed C-130J Hercules assigned to the 19th Operations Group, 19th Airlift Wing, at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas to accomplish all operational and training missions. Late February 2018, the unit returned home from a six-month Operation Enduring Freedom deployment to Kabul, Afghanistan.

Stroh's Ice Cream, founded by the Stroh Brewing Company of Detroit, Michigan, is owned and distributed by Dean Foods of Dallas, Texas. Stroh's Ice Cream is a regional brand distributed mainly in the Midwestern United States. It used to be owned by its namesake company, the Stroh Brewing Company, which had a large presence (and in some cases, like the Detroit area, still has) in this region. History The Stroh Brewery Company, like many other alcohol- producers in the United States, was left searching for ways to restructure its company at the advent of Prohibition in 1920. With the closing of saloons across the nation, ice cream parlors increased in popularity as a new place for the average man to frequent. Julius Stroh, the head of Stroh's Brewery at the time, decided to convert the beer-brewing facilities of its factory in Detroit to producing non-alcoholic products such as near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, and ice. It also produced ice cream under the \\"Alaska\\" brand. At the end of prohibition in America in 1933, the ice cream operation proved to be popular and profitable enough to continue alongside the brewing operation.Blum, Peter H. (1999). Brewed in Detroit: Breweries and Beers Since 1830, p. 72. Wayne State University Press. In the early 1980s, Stroh's built a new ice cream production facility on Maple Street in Detroit, right down the road from its main brewery, which was demolished in 1985. Stroh's sold the facility in 1989 as a part of corporate restructuring at Stroh's. The Stroh Brewery Company sold all of its brands to Pabst Brewing Company and the Miller Brewing Company in 1999 and ended brewing operations. Stroh's Ice Cream was run by Melody Farms for several years, all the time keeping the Stroh's name, until that company was purchased by Dean Foods in 2005. Today Stroh's Ice Cream is still sold primarily in the Metro Detroit area. The primary ice cream plant remained in Detroit until February 2007, when it was announced that the facility would be moving to Belvidere, Illinois, though the Detroit distribution facility would continue to operate.

H. Schulman, starring the Jonas Brothers. The pilot was filmed in September 2008, the series premiered on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009, and became available on demand starting on April 25, 2009. Jonas is the first Disney Channel Original Series since Phil of the Future not to be shot on videotape in a multi-camera format, be filmed before a live studio audience, or use a laugh track. The series was the first on the network to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming. On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Jonas was being picked up for a second season. On May 5, 2010, it was revealed that the name of the series was changed to Jonas L.A., reflecting the move to Los Angeles, making it the first Disney Channel sitcom to have the show's main setting change during the course of the series. The second season premiered on June 20, 2010 and ended on October 3, 2010. In November 2010, Disney Channel announced the series was canceled after two seasons. About Shortly after the Jonas Brothers guest starred on the Hannah Montana episode \\"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\\", development for a TV series and Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock starring the Jonas Brothers began. The original concept for the TV series was about the band playing concerts as a cover while working as government secret agents to save the world and was entitled Jonas (an acronym which stood for \\"Junior Operatives Networking as Spies\\"). At the same time, they tried to hide their double lives from their mother and Frankie. Meanwhile, Stella, ignorant of the Jonas' double lives, dated each of the famous brothers without informing the others and reported the details in her teen magazine column. Said Staub, \\"So pretty much the entire show, it's all of us lying to each other, and kind of everything backfiring, and us getting caught in awkward situations.\\" She described the concept as, \\"like The Monkees and a little of bit of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. There's going to be fun action sequences and still be a sitcom\\". The Jonas pilot was shot in 2007, but the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike impeded progress.Roanoke.com However, Disney Channel Asia aired it during the Sneak Peak 2008. Instead, Disney Channel filmed a mini reality show, the 2008 Disney Channel Original Short Series Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream, which followed the Jonas Brothers on a concert tour and premiered May 16. A few weeks later on June 20, 2008, the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock, in which the brothers starred as the fictional band \\"Connect 3\\", debuted. The Jonas Brothers also released Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience, a Disney Digital 3-D concert film. \\"After this rush of releases, the Jonas Brothers became too popular to imagine them as anything but more dramatic versions of themselves,\\" explained executive producer Michael Curtis. \\"The spy concept was very big and very ambitious and it started to not feel quite right. As the band got bigger and bigger, doing a show that captured more of their real lives and trying to turn that into a more grounded, real version of what they might be doing became more interesting to do and more fun to do.\\". \\"It is now about us being a band and balancing a normal life,\\" Nick Jonas told Access Hollywood. The title of the series changed from J.O.N.A.S. to JONAS, dropping the acronym but remaining in all capitals. Producers have drawn connections between Jonas and productions by earlier bands. Show creator and producer Roger S. H. Schulman claims that \\"It's hard not to make parallel comparisons to The Beatles in 1962 and 1963 when you see the kind of response that the Jonas Brothers' fans have to them,\\" and describes the 1964 A Hard Day's Night and 1965 Help! as \\"very much a template\\" for the series. Producers and critics have also compared the series to The Monkees, a popular but short-lived mid-1960s television comedy also following a real life band. At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2009, Gary Marsh, entertainment president of Disney Channel Worldwide, described Jonas as a cross between The Monkees and Flight of the Conchords. The Chicago Sun-Times remarks that Joe Jonas parallels \\"goofy Micky Dolenz\\", Kevin Jonas \\"quirky Michael Nesmith\\", and Nick Jonas \\"dreamy Davy Jones\\". The Jonas Brothers reportedly watched episodes of The Partridge Family and The Monkees \\"for literally three days straight\\" for inspiration. Characters Cast of Jonas Main * Joseph \\"Joe\\" Lucas (Joe Jonas) ‚Äì Joe is known as the teen heartthrob of the group. He performs lead vocals, as well as keyboards and the rhythm guitar for the brothers' band, JONAS. Girl crazy and flirtatious, Joe will go to any length to get a girl to like him. He is shown to be the most superficial and appearance oriented member of the band, and is obsessed with his hair. Joe tends to be goofier than Nick, but is not quite as quirky as Kevin. Joe likes stuffed animals that make noises. His pockets and backpack are seemingly bottomless and capable of holding comically large quantities. He always carries a blue panda pencil with him. Joe and Stella ‚Äì the brothers' childhood friend and band's stylist ‚Äì are shown to have mutual romantic feelings for one another from the beginning, but both agree that they will not go out, as a potential break-up could ruin both their longtime friendship and working relationship. However, this agreement does nothing to quash Joe's crush on Stella, and he often flirts with her and tries to spend as much time with her as possible. Near the end of season 1, in the episode \\"Double Date\\", Joe and Stella kiss, resolving their romantic tension. They soon decide to become a couple. When the brothers move to Los Angeles, Joe decides to spend his time exploring a career in acting and the film industry. He lands a role in a movie with famous actress Vanessa Page. In the first episode of season 2, \\"House Party\\", Stella witnesses Joe hugging Vanessa, which hurts her and leads to her telling Joe that she'd rather they stay friends. Following the breakup, Joe becomes very jealous when Ben asks Stella out and she accepts. Joe then decides to pursue Vanessa. With Stella dating Ben and Joe dating Vanessa, they still have feelings for one another ‚Äì however, both parties are oblivious to this fact. Joe eventually breaks up with Vanessa after discovering that she dislikes Stella, whom he loves. At the end of the series, he and Stella reunite as a couple, after they both finally become aware of their feelings. * Kevin Percy Lucas (Kevin Jonas) ‚Äì Kevin is the oldest of the brothers, and is usually seen as wild and goofy. Kevin is known to think outside of the box, and likes to imagine wacky animals, such as an otter that can play the trumpet and a bear in a bikini. Kevin often comes up with plans that are insane or impossible, which can make him look na√Øve and unintelligent. However, he shows glimpses of profound thoughts and intellect, and sometimes comes up with genuinely good ideas. Kevin is shown to be very honest, as he's a poor liar; when he lies, his voice becomes comically high- pitched. He owns a full moving rack of guitars, and likes woodland creature stuffed animals. He plays lead guitar and does backup vocals in the brothers' band JONAS, though he once performed lead vocals. He had a crush on a girl that he met in Scandinavia and, when that romance didn't work out, fell for another girl from France, which suggests that he has an affinity for foreign girls. He is more of a risk taker than his brothers. Despite sometimes having a bit of a rivalry (like when they're both vying to get a spot in Justin Timberlake's ping-pong tournament), Nick and Kevin are very close. He also enjoys filmmaking, which is shown in \\"Direct to Video\\", where Kevin very much wants to direct the band's new music video. His middle name, Percy, is revealed by Nick in \\"Date Expectations\\" * Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Lucas (Nick Jonas) ‚Äì Nick is portrayed as being the calm and collected member of the band. He has many short-lived relationships, and his family has criticized him for falling in love too fast. Nick is much more serious than his brothers, sometimes losing his patience with Kevin's silly antics. Nick likes stuffed animals that swim. Nick is the drummer for JONAS, and he occasionally plays the guitar and rhythm guitar for the band. When he was a baby, according to his family, he never smiled ‚Äì Nick claims he was waiting for his teeth to come in (however, when Joe asks what his excuse is now, he does not have a response). Nick is also the mastermind of creative plans gone awry, and can keep a level head amid chaos. He is also seen baking many times in the show; Kevin is unable to resist his blue cookies. In season 2, he develops a relationship with Macy Misa, being smitten by her transformation into a different and more relaxed person who no longer acts like a rabid fangirl to the band. His moments with Macy tend to get interrupted by DZ, to humorous effect. In \\"The Secret\\", Nick is forced to watch over Big Man's niece, Kiara (China Anne McClain), who is aware that he and Macy are dating. In exchange for her silence about their relationship, Nick begrudgingly agrees to do a collaboration with her. He ends up telling the rest of the friends about his relationship through the song that he and Kiara made. Nick is seen to be very thoughtful, and makes a handmade mug for Macy for their one-month anniversary, after learning from Kevin that she likes homemade gifts. Nick suffers from Type 1 diabetes much like Nick Jonas does in real life. * Stella Malone (Chelsea Kane Staub) ‚Äì Stella is Jonas's stylist. She is best friends with Macy and is the brothers' childhood friend ‚Äì she has known the boys since she was three. Stella and Joe both know that they like one another, but don't date, as they don't want a potential breakup to ruin their friendship. However, she gets jealous if she sees Joe with another girl, which was shown when she thought Joe and Macy were dating. Stella created an automated outfit selector called the StellaVator, and is constantly trying to adapt clothes to Jonas's hectic lifestyle. She gets annoyed when her outfits get ruined, which happens a lot more than she'd like. She is addicted to texting, and always has her phone on her. Stella also tries her best to help Macy talk to Jonas normally, instead of like an obsessed fangirl. Unlike her best friend Macy, who is a great athlete, Stella is horrible at sports. She is, however, an excellent seamstress, and once created a dozen girls' volleyball uniforms with very little notice. In the episode \\"Double Date\\", Joe and Stella kiss, and soon become a couple. However, at the beginning of season 2, she sees Joe hugging Vanessa Page, and assumes that they are romantically involved. The incident with Vanessa makes her decide that she only wants to be friends with Joe, rather than be in a relationship. While hiking with Macy, she meets a boy named Ben, whom she goes out with, much to Joe's disappointment. In the episode \\"America's Sweethearts\\", Stella is jealous when Joe's producer asks him to kiss Vanessa. After Joe says that he likes Vanessa, she lies to him, saying that Vanessa doesn't like him back. Stella feels guilty, and admits that she lied. Joe and Vanessa date, and Stella tries her best to not be jealous and spends time with Ben. Neither Joe nor Stella have lost their feelings for one another, however, after Vanessa tells Joe that she doesn't like Stella, Joe breaks up with her. After finally realizing that they both love one another, Stella and Joe become a couple in the series finale. * Macy Misa (Nicole Anderson) ‚Äì Macy is Stella's best friend, as well as the president of JONAS's fan club. In season 1, whenever she approaches the members of Jonas, she becomes incredibly nervous and excited, and either faints or accidentally injures them. She commonly steps on the boys' feet, or hits them in the head with her sports equipment. She often refers to each boy as \\"(first name) of JONAS.\\" When she dates a boy, Randolph, she tries to make him into a JONAS member, even calling the boy \\"Nick\\" as a \\"nickname\\". Macy is very athletic, and plays on a number of sports teams. She also works in her mother's thrift store, called Misa's Pieces. Macy is revealed to be tone deaf, so much so that, according to Stella, they once called Animal Control under the belief that Macy's singing was an injured manatee at a softball game. Macy's dedicated fangirl attitude about Jonas changes into a real friendship with the boys late in season 1, as she begins to see them as people rather than popstars. In the episode \\"Frantic Romantic\\", she and Stella attend a Hollywood Private Party with the boys. In season 2, Macy is shown to have greatly changed, no longer being a passionate fan. This different attitude and the appearance of her real personality intrigues Nick, who eventually falls for her. Her moments with Nick tend to get interrupted by DZ, to a comical effect. In the episode \\"The Secret\\", it officially shows that Macy and Nick are dating ‚Äì however, they want to keep their relationship a secret. It is revealed in a later episode that she has many brothers, and they are a big golfing family. It is also revealed that her mother taught her to play golf and her family only gives handmade gifts. Nick tries to please Macy by making her a mug for their one-month anniversary. Nick and Macy's relationship is eventually revealed, and by the end of the series, they are openly dating and happy with each other. *Thomas ‚ÄúTom‚Äù Lucas (John Ducey; main, season 1; guest, season 2) ‚Äì Joe, Nick, Kevin, and Frankie's father, as well as the manager of Jonas. He is sometimes the voice of reason when his boys have crushes on girls. In his downtime, he often plays hide and seek with Frankie. He is usually nervous when famous people interview the band. It is also shown that he likes woodland creature stuffed animals that can swim and make noises, which are combinations of his son's favorite toys. He is a main character in season 1. In season 2, he appears as a guest in one episode. Recurring * Frankie Lucas (Frankie Jonas) ‚Äì Frankie is the youngest Lucas brother. He is constantly trying to get in the Jonas spotlight. Frankie hopes to get a chance to perform with the band, but his brothers don't think that is likely. Frankie can move very fast, and is an expert at hide- and-seek. He's also very skilled in getting his way. He was raised in New Jersey, and enjoys playing ping-pong. He has a crush on Macy, and was briefly mad at Nick for dating her, even going to lengths to try and \\"steal\\" her. * Big Man (Robert \\"Big Rob\\" Feggans) ‚Äì He is the bodyguard who escorts the band everywhere. He is seen to live with the boys in L.A. He has a niece, Kiara. Season 1 * Sandy Lucas (Rebecca Creskoff) ‚Äì She is the mother of Kevin, Joe, Nick, and Frankie, and is Tom's wife. She's down to earth and always proud of her sons, despite their mistakes. Mrs. Lucas just wants to have a normal family, but has acknowledged that it may not be possible with famous children. She is mostly an off-screen character. * Van Dyke Tosh (Chuck Hittinger) ‚Äì He is Stella's occasional love interest, who habitually makes Joe jealous. Van Dyke asks Stella on a date in the episode \\"Double Date\\", which causes Joe to crash their date. * Mrs. Snark (Tangelina Rouse) ‚Äì The biology/drama teacher who loves Joe, Nick, and Kevin. Much to Joe's chagrin, she often gives them preferential treatment in school, sometimes causing tension between the boys and other students. Her niece is a huge Jonas fan. Season 2 * Dennis Zimmer \\"DZ\\" (Adam Hicks) ‚Äì A new friend who the band meets while in L.A. He is the son of a very wealthy and successful record producer. He shows the band the \\"hot spots\\" in Los Angeles. He is very fun and outgoing. He is also an aspiring rapper, and tries to get his father to listen to his songs but can never get the chance. * Vanessa Paige (Abby Pivaronas) ‚Äì A popular actress who co-stars with Joe in a big-time film, \\"Forever April\\". She is also briefly his girlfriend on the show, until he breaks up with her because she dislikes Stella. * Lisa Malone (Beth Crosby) ‚Äì Stella's aunt who Stella and Macy stay with while residing in Los Angeles. She doesn't want them to date rock stars, as she made the mistake of dating rock stars twelve times. She appears in nearly all of the episodes in season 2, despite not being a main character. * Mona Klein (Debi Mazar) ‚Äì The director of Forever April. In \\"Up in the Air\\", after Joe and Vanessa break up, Mona gives some advice to Joe, saying \\"when you find something real, never let it go\\". * Kiara Tyshanna (China Anne McClain) ‚Äì The niece of Big Man. She is the first one to find out about Nick and Macy dating.  Production  The series was shot at Hollywood Center Studios, which has also been the home to several other Disney Channel sitcoms over the years including The Suite Life on Deck and Wizards of Waverly Place. The series was originally set in New Jersey for the first season, with comedic storylines on the boys trying to lead \\"normal\\" lives while being famous. For the second season, the setting changed to Los Angeles, and shifted towards a more drama, serial-driven story line. In November 2010, Disney Channel officially announced that Jonas L.A. would not return for a third season. The network did mention, however, that they would be working with the Jonas Brothers in the future. As of 2019, Jonas L.A. remains the only Disney Channel Original Series produced by It's a Laugh Productions to not be filmed before a live studio audience. In their 2019 documentary Chasing Happiness, the brothers revealed that they regretted doing the television series. All three agreed that the series was \\"not good\\" and felt that it negatively impacted their image. Nick also felt that the second season in particular limited their growth as a band.  Casting  Nicole Anderson also auditioned for the role of Stella, but actress Chelsea Staub ended up winning the part. According to Staub, her previous work with director Sean McNamara helped her land the role. After the series plot changed, producers decided to create a best friend for Stella and offered Anderson, Staub's real life best friend, the role of Macy.Sprinklepoponline.com Jonas was intended to star Kevin, Nick, and Joe Jonas, who lend their first names to their television counterparts. The role of Frankie Lucas was also created with Frankie Jonas in mind. In addition, Robert \\"Big Rob\\" Feggans, the Jonas Brothers real-life head of security, plays The Big Man, the JONAS bodyguard.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called the show \\"The Monkees for millennials\\" and enjoyed the featured Jonas Brothers music. Variety magazine reviewer Brian Lowry believed that Jonas Brothers' adorers would be pleased with the result, and that those who are not fans would still find an amiable charm within the series. Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times found the series better than Hannah Montana, but commented that Nick Jonas' reserved nature made him the weak link of the premiere episode and that the boys' amateur acting is \\"endearing until they play a scene opposite someone with real comedic timing ‚Äì like John Ducey.\\" The New York Times' John Carmanica was also disappointed with Nick's performance, particularly because, according to Carmanica, he gives off the savviest air in the band's off screen life. Carmanica also criticizes the series' script as blithe, unfunny, and \\"seeded with profound cynicism\\", but praised the believable fraternal interactions and Kevin Jonas' acting.  Viewer reception  The series was the first series on Disney Channel to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming and compete with Nickelodeon's traditional dominance of the evening. The show was paired with the established series Wizards of Waverly Place, which moved from a Sunday early evening timeslot, in the 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) slot. The series debuted on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009, and drew a solid 4.00 million viewers in the US, 73% of which was female. While this amounted to Disney Channel's best ratings in the time slot in eight months,EW.com it was also Disney Channel's second-lowest rated live-action series premiere in nearly four years. The Hollywood Reporter comments that \\"Jonas didn't do poorly, exactly. [...] It's just that one expects the premiere of a show by a heavily promoted major Disney brand like the Jonas Brothers to make a bigger splash.\\" Viewership for the series second episode the following week fell sharply to nearly half its premiere audience‚Äî2.2 million total U.S. viewers and beyond cable's Top 100, which E!: Entertainment Television notes \\"in the grand scheme of things, is still a very good showing - unless you're trying to live up to the media's expectations for a world famous act.\\" E! credits the decline to the premiere of Nickelodeon's hour-long iCarly special, \\"iDate a Bad Boy\\", which earned 6.5 million viewers.Are the Jonas Brothers Over‚Ä¶Again? Ratings improved over the following episodes, and the New York Times reported, \\"If \\"Jonas\\" can dent ratings for iCarly [‚Ä¶] the brothers‚Äô sitcom will be considered a big success internally. However, just weeks after its premiere Disney Channel moved Jonas and Wizards of Waverly Place to Sunday and Friday evenings, respectively, and began airing movies in its old timeslot. In its Sunday timeslot, Jonas has been doing well in key kids demographics and averaging 3.4 million viewers. However, the move to Sundays and Fridays and declining ratings, along with the change in setting and ill-fated strategies in promoting the show would result in Disney's decision to pull the plug on \\"Jonas L.A.\\" On November 8, 2010, it announced that the show will not return for a third season. In a statement from a Disney Channel spokesperson: \\"We've been fortunate to work with the enormously talented Jonas Brothers on several projects, including the Emmy-nominated series JONAS L.A.,\\" adding that \\"We look forward to working with them on new projects in the future.\\"\\"Disney Channel Cancels JONAS L.A.\\" from TV Guide (November 8, 2010)  Awards and nominations  {  - !

Cindai was the first attempt by Siti to sing traditional Malay folk songs. It was the most memorable album in the 1990s for its impact on the Malaysian music industry. The eponymous first track has been nominated for the best song in the 1990s. The album was Nurhaliza's first album to have a title track. Recording Cindai was Nurhaliza's first collaboration with Suhaimi Mohd Zain, fondly known as Pak Ngah, as the album producer and became her first full traditional album. It was produced after the success of her two self-titled albums. Following the success of her first traditional Malay song, \\"Sri Mersing\\" in her album Siti Nurhaliza II, Nurhaliza recorded a fully traditional Malay album. Most of the songs were traditional compositions, with only two originals, namely \\"Cindai\\" and \\"Joget Berhibur\\". The other songs were produced with new arrangements. Musical style Nurhaliza is accompanied by an acoustic band for the traditional feel and adopted the zapin rhythm. Release and reception Cindai was released on 17 November 1997, eleven months after Siti Nurhaliza II. She later emphasized traditional Malay music on her later albums, Seri Balas (a duet album with Noraniza Idris; 1999), Sahmura (2000), Sanggar Mustika (2002) and Lentera Timur (2008). To promote the album, three songs ‚Äì \\"Cindai\\", \\"Joget Pahang\\" and \\"Joget Berhibur\\" - were released and later received music videos. She also performed the title song, \\"Cindai\\", as part of her special performance during the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Cindai was a commercial success and sold over 400,000 copies on its release and was certified 5x platinum. \\"Cindai\\" has also been translated into Mandarin sung by the Chinese singer Chien Bai Hui, though some of the lyrics remained untranslated, in which Chien claimed that she could not alter them due to their perceived beautiful and poetic composition. On 1 April 2005, she sang Cindai as a part of a medley of Zapin songs along with Mahligai Permata and Ya Maulai at the end of Irama Malaysia segments of her solo concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

Doctors believed that ninety percent of insanity cases were curable, but only if treated outside the home, in large-scale buildings. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists considered the architecture of asylums, especially their planning, to be one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of the insane, targeting social as well as biological factors to facilitate the treatment of mental illnesses. The construction and usage of these quasi-public buildings served to legitimize developing ideas in psychiatry. About 300 psychiatric hospitals, known at the time as insane asylums or colloquially as ‚Äúloony bins‚Äù or ‚Äúnuthouses,‚Äù were constructed in the United States before 1900.Yanni, Architecture of Madness, citing Hurd. Asylum architecture is notable for the way similar floor plans were built in a wide range of architectural styles.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~asylums/ Historic Asylums of America Theory and Development of Asylum Architecture The medical profession of psychiatry, known as \\"Asylum Medicine\\" from about 1830 on, in insane hospitals was instrumental in the planning and development of asylum architecture. Nineteenth-century philosophers and architectural theorists argued that the natural and built environment shaped behavior. The doctors who promoted the establishment of mental hospitals used the same rhetoric as social reformers and park enthusiasts: that nature was curative, exercise therapeutic, and the city a source of vice.Henry P. Stearns, ‚ÄúThe Relations of Insanity to Modern Civilization,‚Äù Scribner‚Äôs Monthly 17 (February 1879), 586 Early psychiatrists assumed that mental derangement was caused by environmental factors, particularly the tensions present in the individual‚Äôs current domestic or social environment,John M. Galt, ‚ÄúThe Farm of St. Anne,‚Äù American Journal of Insanity 11 (1854-55), 354. which in turn suggested that a changed setting might alleviate psychic pain. Psychiatrists, also known as medical superintendents, collaborated with architects to enhance the new social environment of the insane asylum. A series of plans, such as the Kirkbride plan and the Cottage plan, resulted from this collaboration, developed using theories that would help facilitate the treatment of patients. The Kirkbride Plan The Quaker reformers, including Samuel Tuke, who promoted the moral treatment, as it was called, argued that patients should be unchained, granted respect, encouraged to perform occupational tasks (like farming, carpentry, or laundry), and allowed to stroll the grounds with an attendant and attend occasional dances.Roy Porter, Mind-Forg'd Manacles: A History of Madness in England from the Restoration to the Regency (London: Athlone, 1987), 147 While the moral treatment could, with difficulty, be employed in an old house or adapted almshouse, this situation was considered a sad compromise. In the United States, doctors developed a highly specialized building type for 250 patients. Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride devised a widely applicable set of planning principles that ensured classification by type of illness, ease of surveillance, short wards for good ventilation, and clarity of circulation.Nancy Tomes, The Art of Asylum-Keeping: Thomas Story Kirkbride and the Origins of American Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994Kirkbride Buildings The buildings helped establish psychiatry as a profession, because the asylum was the only setting for the practice of psychiatry in the nineteenth century, there were no out-patient visits, no doctors‚Äô offices. Professional medical journals were replete with articles on architecture, a constant preoccupation for the asylum superintendent, and architects ventured opinions about the proper classification of patients. The Cottage Plan The Kirkbride plan, also called the linear plan, dominated asylum building. It tended to produce very large, long structures. By the middle of the nineteenth century, some doctors complained that large monolithic asylums had not lived up to their expectations. But psychiatrists did not immediately abandon their belief in the therapeutic environment; instead, they argued for a different therapeutic environment. Clinging to a belief that architecture influenced human conduct, they proposed smaller cottage-like structures to replace the Kirkbride-plan hospitals. These cottages were to be arranged in a village, an homage to the Belgian town of Gheel, where citizens looked after mentally ill people who for centuries gathered there to worship at the shrine of St. Dymphna, the patron saint of lunatics. Dr. John Galt romanticized this medieval model as an ideal setting for the cure of the disease, thus causing a rift among the self-named ‚Äúbrethren‚Äù of asylum superintendents. The cottages varied in size from those which accommodated six to a dozen patients to larger ones which accommodated 20 or more. They were usually constructed either in groups or along streets and avenues as a village. In the group arrangement, the several groups were given up to a particular industry as a farm group, where the patients were employed at farming, and others, as the garden, the brick yard, shop industries, etc., all of these being a part of one institution on a single large estate. In the village plan, the institution was laid off in streets and avenues, and had the appearance of an ordinary village, each cottage having a flower garden in front, shade trees, etc. In either plan, there was conveniently located near the center of the plant an administration building, a hospital for the sick and those requiring special care, a bakery, a laundry and other utility buildings. The cost of construction was small as compared with older plans of asylum construction. This approach was viewed as more homelike, more convenient for administration and as permitting indefinite expansion. Some of the best known institutions constructed on this plan were Alt-Scherbitz near Leipzig; Gabersee near Munich, Germany; the Saint Lawrence State Hospital at Ogdensburg, New York; the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Etobicoke, Ontario; and the Craig Colony for Epileptics at Sonyea, New York. Other Some doctors proposed that the insane be treated on farms or in the community, which is some ways was a precursor to \\"Care in the Community\\" in the twentieth century. The concept was notably different, however, from de- institutionalization of the latter half of the twentieth century.Andrew Scull, Decarceration: Community Treatment and the Deviant--a Radical View, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice Hall, 1977), 112; 107 First Purpose Built Asylum The first purpose-built asylum in the United States was the Public Hospital in Virginia of 1770. It housed mentally ill people as well as developmentally disabled people. The Public Hospital was reconstructed in 1986. It is now a museum at Colonial Williamsburg. The first purpose-built asylum in the United Kingdom was Bethel Hospital, Bethel Street in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Founded and built by Mary Chapman (1647-1724), who was the wife of Reverend Samuel Chapman and built wholly at her own expense in 1713. The plan for the building was along an \\"H\\" block architectural design style.  Major Architects and the Kirkbride Plan  At the peak of the success of the Kirkbride plan, these hospitals were technological marvels that demonstrated advanced fireproof construction, state-of-the-art heating and ventilation, and fresh water delivery systems; some had their own railroads. They were surrounded by well-designed picturesque gardens that predate many public parks. Accomplished architects, including John Haviland, John Notman, Andrew Jackson Downing, Samuel Sloan, Thomas U. Walter, Frederick Clarke Withers, Calvert Vaux, Frederick Law Olmsted, and H.H. Richardson designed asylum grounds and buildings.Carla Yanni, The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States, University of Minnesota Press, 2007. Decline The complicated decline of the large-scale insane asylum was caused partly by overcrowding and neglect, but also by massive changes in the practice of psychiatry. With the ascent of neurology, which focused attention on mental illness as a result of physical causes, the environment ceased to seem like an important cause or likely cure, and a new generation of doctors regarded architecture as irrelevant to the practice of psychiatric medicine.Gerald Grob, The Mad Among Us: A History of the Care of America's Mentally Ill, Harvard University Press, 1995, passim.

The school has students from Pre-kindergarten to 12th grade and is non-sectarian and coeducational. History Isle of Wight Academy started in the space previously occupied by the Isle of Wight Elementary School, as a segregation academy. It was open for one year until, in the fall of 1968, a fire completely destroyed the school building, leaving only the original gymnasium (which remains the only building standing on the campus from the original school structure). With funding from the school community, the academy was able to rebuild with four permanent classroom buildings and a new gymnasium. The academy was one of many such schools which lost tax-exempt status in the early 1970s because of racially discriminatory admissions policies. During the 1980s enrollment began to decrease. After briefly losing its tax-exempt status again in 1985 it finally regained it June 1987. In 1988, The school enrolled three African-American students out of 300, and in 1989 one. Headmaster Don Deaton told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that \\"We would like to have more African-American students but it's hard to attract them.\\" The early 1990s saw a reversal of fortune for the school. Enrollment began a steady increase and more programs began to be offered to the growing student body. Enrollment now stands at approximately 650 students, the most ever enrolled at the Academy. On December 3, 2013, Smithfield Foods, a subsidiary of Shuanghui International Holdings Limited, pledged $1 million to the school for facilities and scholarships. Mission The philosophy is to \\"accept students of average or above average ability and develop them to their fullest potential by providing a quality program, which will build the student mentally, physically, and spiritually. The school emphasizes the honor, integrity, social development, and citizenship of the student.\\"  Academics  Being a college-preparatory institution, Isle of Wight Academy has courses with an emphasis upon equipping the students for a college education. In order to aid with this, the school has a variety of dual-enrollment and Advanced Placement (AP) classes. IWA partners with Paul D. Camp Community College and Richard Bland College to offer the following dual credit courses at present: US History (6 credits), French IV ( 8 credits), Spanish IV (8 credits), Economics (6 credits), English (6 credits), and Statistics/Linear Algebra (6 credits). AP US Government and AP English Literature and Compositon are the currently offered Advanvced Placement classes. Some of the recent institutions attended by IWA graduates include the University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary, Virginia Tech, James Madison University, Old Dominion University, as well as others.  Extracurricular Activities  Isle of Wight Academy has a number of extracurricular activities for the Upper and Lower School students. For the Upper School, clubs such as the Student Council Organization (SCO), Key Club, Drama Club, and Science Club have the largest degree of participation. The Upper School also has a number of academic competition teams, such as the Scholastic Bowl, Battle of the Brains, Science Bowl, Blue Crab Bowl, and Envirothon teams. The Upper School has chapters in four national honor societies, the National Honor Society, National Junior Honor Society, French National Honor Society, and Spanish National Honor Society. The Lower School has the Junior Student Cooperative Organization (JSCO) and the Middle School Science Club to offer academic enrichment outside of the classroom. Isle of Wight Academy offers half-credit courses in fine arts, such as Upper School Band, Chorus, and Audio Visual Technology. The Upper School participates in the Association of Virginia Academies (AVA) Forensics and Fine Arts competitions, where many students place high in their respective categories. Athletics Isle of Wight Academy is a member of both the Virginia Colonial Conference and Metro Athletic Conference. In its history, IWA has won 70 conference season championships, 35 conference tournament championships, and 11 state championships (five in softball, five in football, and one in baseball). IWA sponsors the following varsity and junior varsity sports: football, basketball, volleyball, baseball, softball, cross country, soccer, golf, and winter and fall cheerleading. Daniel Brown attended Isle of Wight Academy, where he was a three-sport athlete (basketball, football, and baseball). From 2005-2007, he helped Isle of Wight win three consecutive state championships. He is a tight end for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL).

Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (1893 ed.) Gijsbrecht van Aemstel ()In isolation, van is pronounced . was a 17th-century history play by Joost van den Vondel, written to inaugurate Amsterdam's first city theatre. The first production was planned to take place on 26 December 1637, but was postponed until 3 January 1638. The piece was then performed annually (on New Year's Day) in Amsterdam until 1968. Plot Set in 1304, it tells the story of the siege of Amsterdam and its surrounding towns, united by the Kennemers and Waterlanders. The reason for the siege is Gijsbrecht's alleged involvement in the abduction and manslaughter of Floris V in 1296. The enemy soldiers appear to leave but smuggle themselves into the town, hidden in a cargo of firewood being shipped in by the citizens of Amsterdam. After a violent battle, Gijsbrecht is forced to flee to Prussia, to found a \\"New Holland\\" there. Historical accuracy In reality, the nobleman who in 1304 invaded Amsterdam (to recover his position and possessions lost in 1296) was not Gijsbrecht IV (1235‚Äì1303), but his son Jan I (1270‚Äì1345). Historian Pim de Boer at the University of Groningen has found serious (though not entirely conclusive) indications that Gijsbrecht - after his exile, with a few followers - founded Pruissisch Holland (now in Poland), not far from Elbing (also now in Poland).

The role was formed in February 2020, with the existing Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop taking on additional responsibilities for economic matters (effectively adding the responsibilities of the former Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work to her existing culture responsibilities). Responsibility for external affairs was transferred to the Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations, with the post being renamed Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, Europe and External Affairs, whilst tourism moved to the Rural Economy brief. The cabinet secretary is supported by two ministers, the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills and the Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation. History The Europe and External Affairs brief was instituted in 2000 and combined with Education as the Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs which was a Cabinet position in the McLeish Government. After 2001 the Europe and External Affairs Brief was abolished as a ministerial position. From 1999 to 2001, the Culture brief was a junior post in the Scottish Government as Deputy Minister for Culture and Sport. It was made into a Cabinet position as Minister for Culture and Sport in the First McConnell government from 2001‚Äì2003. The Second McConnell government from 2003‚Äì2007 combined the Culture and Sport brief with Tourism to form a Cabinet post in the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Culture was combined with External Affairs and Europe, to form a junior ministerial position, of Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture in the Salmond government following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. In February 2009 the role was expanded to deal with constitutional issues this additional role was later removed in December 2009 following the publication of the National Conversation. After the 2011 Scottish Parliament election the office-holder returned to the Cabinet with the junior ministerial post being transformed into the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs.

Formation After Ghana attained its independence on 6 March 1957, the Parliament of Ghana passed the Avoidance of Discrimination Act, 1957 (C.A. 38), which banned all parties and organizations that were confined to or identifiable to any racial, ethnic or religious groups with effect form 31 December 1957. The title of the Act was: > An Act to prohibit organizations using or engaging in tribal, regional, > racial and religious propaganda to the detriment of any community, or > securing the election of persons on account of their tribal, regional or > religious affiliations and for other purpose connected therewith. This law meant that all the existing political parties would become illegal. These parties included the Northern People's Party, Muslim Association Party, National Liberation Movement (NLM), Anlo Youth Organization, Togoland Congress and the Ga Shifimokpee. They therefore merged under the leadership of Kofi Abrefa Busia as the United Party. Demise The party's effectiveness as the opposition suffered when it was no more recognised as the official opposition after Ghana became a republic in 1960. In September 1962, the National Assembly passed a resolution calling for a one-party state. This was accepted following a referendum in January 1964. This effectively sounded the death of all opposition parties in Ghana and this situation persisted until February 24, 1966 when the Nkrumah government was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat. Political tradition The United Party, though it was an amalgam of all opposition parties of the time, was dominated by the NLM which was the biggest opposition party before its formation. The NLM saw some of its roots in the Ghana Congress Party and the United Gold Coast Convention. The following parties all claimed their roots from the \\"UGCC - UP tradition\\". * Progress Party - led by Busia and formed Busia government between 1969 and 1972. * Popular Front Party - led by Victor Owusu, was the largest opposition party between 1979 and 1981. * New Patriotic Party - first led by Albert Adu Boahen.

This includes regulating cooperation that hinders competition, misuse of a dominant market position and control of buy-outs and mergers. The authority is based in Bergen. History Competition regulation in Norway dates back to the break-out of World War I when merchants made large profits maximizing the price of necessary goods. To counter this, the authorities regulated the price and availability of food through rations. On July 21, 1917 the Norwegian Price Directorate was created to regulate the Norwegian market. The present name came in 1994 when a new Competition Act was passed and the authority restructured. In 2003, the agency was moved from Oslo to Bergen, along with six other directorates and inspectorates which were moved out of Oslo, in a program initialized by Victor Norman, Minister of Government Administration and Reform of the Conservative Party. It cost 729 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to move the seven agencies. An official report from 2009 concluded that the agencies had lost 75 to 90% of their employees, mostly those with long seniority, and that for a while critical functions for society were dysfunctional. No costs reductions had been made, there was no significant impact on the target area, and there was little impact on the communication between the agencies and the ministries. In a 2010 report, Professor Jarle Trondal concluded that none of the agencies had become more independent after the move, despite this being one of the main arguments from the minister. Norman successor, Heidi Grande R√∏ys of the Socialist Left Party, stated that the moving had had an important symbolic effect on the target areas, and that she did not see the lack of advantages as a reason to not move similar agencies later.

A single- engined monoplane, it was unsuccessful, with only two examples being built. The Fairey Barracuda, built to the same specification, would fill this role. Design and development The Type 322 was designed by Supermarine to meet a 1937 requirement (Specification S.24/37) for a replacement for the British Royal Navy's Fairey Albacore biplane (even though the Albacore was yet to fly, with orders placed both with Supermarine, and with Fairey Aviation for what became the Barracuda.Mason 1994, p. 354. Supermarine's design was a high-wing monoplane, originally intended to be powered by the Rolls-Royce Exe engine. Unusually it featured a variable-incidence wing, first demonstrated on the French Paul Scmitt biplane at the Paris Airshow in 1913.Thetford 1946, p. 31. Variable incidence allowed the fuselage to be kept at the optimum angle for good visibility whilst maintaining lift ‚Äì particularly useful for a carrier- borne aircraft and with tail-wheel undercarriage. The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the flap setting was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a stalling speed of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded ‚Äì a remarkable technical achievement in view of the small increase in structural weight involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity.Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 163. It would have been very challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings. It was primarily of wooden construction, in common with the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber since, when it was being built, there was a danger of light alloy being in short supply. The Exe was cancelled in 1938, and the Rolls- Royce Merlin was substituted in the design. Operational history Two Type 322s, nicknamed \\"Dumbo\\", were built. Originally due for completion in early 1941, the project was delayed owing to the high priority then in force for the production of Spitfires. The first prototype (R1810) flew on 6 February 1943, followed by the second prototype (R1815) with the Merlin 32 in place of the Merlin 30, a four-blade rotol constant speed airscrew, a tail of greater area and alclad covered outer wings. By this time, however, Fairey's competing design had entered service as the Fairey Barracuda, and the two Type 322s were used as experimental aircraft. A developed version was planned as the Supermarine type 380. It was also intended that this wing technology was to the incorporated in a replacement for the Sea Otter ‚Äì variable incidence benefiting seaplanes where the optimum angle of the floats can be maintained during takeoff and landing. Postwar, R1815 was retained by the company and was used in 1946 for chase in the low-speed handling trials of the Supermarine Attacker.Chorlton 2012, p. 59.

Other common names include the bull-headed catfish, blue catfish, broad-headed catfish, jelly wolffish, and the Arctic wolffish. Inuit in the Western Arctic (Bathurst Inlet) do not distinguish between the northern wolffish and the Bering wolffish (A. orientalis), calling both by the name akoak or akoaksaluk (\\"old woman fish\\"). This fish, sometimes considered \\"charmingly ugly\\", is found across the North Atlantic Ocean from north of Russia to the Scotian Shelf, off Nova Scotia. Its western Atlantic population declined dramatically during the 1980s, in part because it is often caught by fishers seeking other catch. The population was observed to decline by more than 90% from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. This species has been identified as Threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. It is listed under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and was afforded protection under the SARA as of June 2004. Under the SARA, a recovery strategy must be developed for this species. Additional protection is afforded through the federal Fisheries Act.  Characteristics  Chessington Sealife Centre Northern wolffish are demersal fish. In summer, mature females lay up to 30,000 extremely large eggs in a nest on the sea floor. Adults are observed to make limited movements and are not migratory. The northern wolffish favours open continental-shelf water that is cold, usually between , and mainly at depths between . The fish is thought to prefer a rocky or muddy sea floor, but is found over all types of ocean bottoms. Sharp teeth and powerful jaws allow the northern wolffish to capture moving (pelagic) fish, starfish, sea urchins, and crabs. They also include some bottom-dwelling (benthic) organisms in their diets. Their fearsome teeth, however, ensure they have few natural predators. They are not retained by fishermen for food because of their watery and jelly- like flesh. In the Canadian Arctic, northern wolffish occur primarily in Davis Strait, with their northernmost limit in Baffin Bay. A few records report them in the western Arctic, including as far west as Prince Patrick Island, NWT. In the North Atlantic, they are found on both sides of the ocean, from southern Newfoundland to the Barents Sea. In Canada, they occur primarily off the northeast Newfoundland/Labrador Shelf and the outer Grand Banks.  Identification  This image was drawn in 1896 in Oceanic Ichthyology by G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean The northern wolffish is thick and heavyset, with a large head and teeth at the front of the jaw that are smaller and sharper than the other two wolffish species found in Atlantic Canada. The shape and size of its mouth and teeth allow it to capture moving (pelagic) prey. It can grow to in length and almost in weight. The northern wolffish has a more uniform body colour than the other wolffish species, ranging from grey to dark chocolate, sometimes with a light violet sheen. Habitat and life history Northern wolffish are found offshore in cold water (below ), at depths ranging between the surface and , but most often below . These fish inhabit a wide range of bottom types, including silt, rocks, coarse sand, and shell hash. They use large rocks for shelter and nest building. Late in the year, females lay about 46,500 large eggs (up to in diameter) which sink to the sea floor, where they are guarded in nests by the males until they hatch. Growth rates are slow, and they mature at five years or older. Their lifespans are at least 12 years. Unlike other wolffishes, northerns have been found off the bottom during both the juvenile and adult stages. The species does not form large schools or undertake long migrations. This fish feeds in open water on comb jellies and jellyfish, and on bottom-living crustaceans and invertebrates, such as crabs, sea urchins, brittle stars, and starfish.  Threats  No direct studies of factors responsible for the observed declines in abundance have been conducted, but overfishing and habitat alteration are believed to have played a role. This species is not targeted by the fishing industry, but bycatch mortality by offshore trawlers and long-liners is considered a threat. In addition, activities that disturb the ocean bottom, such as trawling, may damage spawning habitat.  Similar species  The northern wolffish can be distinguished from the spotted wolffish (A. minor) and the Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.  Conservation status  The northern wolffish is protected under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A recovery team for the northern and spotted wolffish has almost completed a recovery strategy and plan for both species. The strategy provides a framework for improving the status of wolffish through an enhanced understanding of their life history, potential sources of harm, and implementing management measures such as live release of captured wolffish. The plan also includes habitat stewardship and educational activities designed to involve stakeholders and inform the public.

Besides tangible property, economic rights are also usually treated as property, in addition to being covered by the law of obligations. Principles Israel came into existence on 14 May 1948 with its Declaration of Independence. The Provisional State Council's first legislative act was the \\"Law and Administration Ordinance of 1948\\", a reception statute. The act adopted all existing laws \\"with such modifications as may result from establishment of the State or its authorities.\\" In respect of land law matters, Ottoman laws, as had been modified by British land law during the Mandate period, continued to apply. Most of these laws have been repealed by the last quarter of the 20th century. Over time, a modern set of codificative statutes have been enacted. These are mostly a codification of common law norms, albeit with a notable continental influence. Chief among these are the Land Law, 1969 and the Movable Property Law, 1971. They are joined by a multitude of other legislative acts pertaining to property law, in addition to a highly detailed body of case law by the Supreme Court and lower courts. Some of the main tenets of Israeli property law are: #In land law, a system of title registration (Torrens title) is in place, allowing any person to quickly retrieve (usually through the internet) a summary of ownership and other rights towards any parcel of land. The legal transfer of land is only effectuated when a deed is executed and registered in the Land Registry Bureau (also known as Tabo or Tabu, ◊ò◊ê◊ë◊ï). Under the Torrens title system, the Land Registry serves as an absolute guarantee of the title, allowing for a relatively easy and safe negotiation of land transactions. As of 2016, about 4% of the country's land area is still registered under a pre-Torrens, deeds registration system. #Private property rights enjoy a fairly strong protection from encroachment, both by other private parties and by the government. Even when eminent domain is utilized, the government almost universally has to compensate for the fair value of the land. #While private ownership of land is common (mainly in urban areas), most of the land in Israel (over 90% of the land area) is in the ownership of either the State of Israel, the Development Authority (Rashut Hapituakh, ◊®◊©◊ï◊™ ◊î◊§◊ô◊™◊ï◊ó) or the Jewish National Fund. According to Basic Law: Israel Lands, enacted in 1960, the land owned by these three bodies is administered by the Israel Land Authority (ILA). The land so owned is often leased to private persons, typically in a long-term lease for a period of 99 years. This creates a situation where, on the one hand, the land is privately held for most practical purposes; on the other hand, the ILA still wields a considerable bureaucratic power over citizens, particularly during the transfer of lease from one person to another, or various other procedures related to land use and registration, where the law requires consent or ongoing involvement by the ILA. Beginning in the first decade of the 21st century, the Knesset has enacted laws encouraging the full transfer of ownership, for no additional payment, from the ILA-represented bodies to the lessees, who thereby become owners. #The most common type of housing in Israel is condominiums. The Land Law, 1969 details the legal structure of this type of property, including the rights of tenants among themselves (mainly in regard to common areas) and towards third parties. A contractual document, the bylaws (takanon, ◊™◊ß◊†◊ï◊ü), is required to exist for every condominium; often, the common bylaws, provided as an appendix to the Land Law, 1969, are used, but many condominiums do have more detailed bylaws, agreed between apartment owners. #The Land Law, 1969 enacts a \\"closed list\\" approach, listing five types of proprietary claims that may exist towards land: ownership, rental (including lease), mortgage, beneficial use and right of first refusal. However, in practice, other types of claims exist and are treated as equitable. In addition, a warning note or caveat (he'arat azhara, ◊î◊¢◊®◊™ ◊ê◊ñ◊î◊®◊î) is regularly placed in the Land Registry after a transaction is agreed upon and before its registration is completed. In many cases, due to various impediments to completing the registration, the warning note remains on the Land Registry for decades, commonly perceived as providing a sufficient protection to the acquirer's interests. Overview In 1945, of the 26.4 million dunams (26,400 km¬≤) of land in Mandatory Palestine, 12.8 million was either owned or held in indefinite lease by Arabs, 1.5 million by Jews, 1.5 million was public land and 10.6 million constituted the desertic Beersheba district (Negev). Of the 9.2 million dunams of land that was arable, 7.8 million dunams was owned by Arabs, 1.2 million by Jews and 0.2 million was public land.Village Statistics of 1945: A Classification of Land and Area ownership in Palestine By 1949, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had fled or been expelled from their lands and villages. Israel was now in control of some 20.5 million dunams (approx. 20,500 km¬≤) or 78% of lands in what had been Mandatory Palestine: 8% (approx. 1,650 km¬≤) were privately controlled by Jews, 6% (approx. 1,300 km¬≤) by Arabs, with the remaining 86% being public land.Abu Sitta, Salman (2001): From Refugees to Citizens at Home.

Land laws were passed to legalize changes to land ownership.Ruling Palestine, A History of the Legally Sanctioned Jewish-Israeli Seizure of Land and Housing in Palestine. Publishers: COHRE & BADIL, May 2005, p. 37. As at 2007, the Israel Land Administration (ILA), which was established in 1960, manages 93% of Israel's land comprising 19,508 km¬≤ under the following laws and land policy. The remaining 7% of land is either privately owned or under the protection of religious authorities. * Basic Law: Israel lands (1960) states that all the lands owned by the state of Israel will remain in state ownership, and will not be sold or given to anyone, but allows for the Kenesset to override that ban on privatization by legislation.Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) * Israel Lands Law (1960) details several exceptions to the basic law. * Israel Land Administration Law (1960) describes the details of establishing and operating the Israel Land Administration.Israel Land Administration Law * Covenant between the State of Israel and the World Zionist Organization, establishing the Jewish National Fund (1960).Israel Land Administration. General Information 13 percent of Israel's land belongs to the Jewish National Fund, which is managed by the ILA. Use of land in Israel usually means leasing rights from the ILA for a period of 49 or 98 years. Under Israeli law, the ILA cannot lease land to foreign nationals, which includes Palestinian residents of Jerusalem who have identity cards but are not citizens of Israel. In practice, foreigners may be allowed to lease if they show that they would qualify as Jewish under the Law of Return. History Ottoman era The Ottoman Empire embarked on a systematic land reform program in the second half of the 19th century. Two of the new laws were the 1858 land registration law and the 1873 land emancipation act. Prior to 1858, land in Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire since 1516, was cultivated or occupied mainly by peasants. Land ownership was regulated by people living on the land according to customs and traditions. Usually, land was communally owned by village residents, though land could be owned by individuals or families.Ottoman Land Registration Law as a Contributing Factor in the Israeli-Arab Conflict , Jon- Jay Tilsen, Congregation Beth El‚ÄìKeser Israel (retrieved August 14, 2006) The Ottoman Land Code of 1858 required land owners to register ownership. The reasons behind the law were twofold: (1) to increase tax revenue, and (2) to enable the government exercise greater state control over the area. However, many peasants did not register their claims, for several reasons: for example, land owners were subject to military service in the Ottoman Army, there was general opposition to official regulations from the Ottoman Empire, and to evade payment of taxes and registration fees to the Ottoman Empire. The registration process itself was open to falsification and manipulation. Land collectively owned by village residents ended up being registered to one villager, and merchants and local Ottoman administrators took the opportunity to register large areas of land in their own name. The result was that land became registered to people who had never lived on the land; while the peasants, having lived there for generations, retained possession, but became tenants of absentee owners. The 1873 land emancipation act gave Jews the right to own land in Palestine under their own name. This 1873 secular land reform/civil rights law was popularly confused with a religious law and it was held as a \\"humiliation to Islam that Jews should own a part of the Muslim Ummah\\". The confusion between religious and secular law made the laws (ended in 1873) against Jewish ownership of land 'religious laws'. Over the course of the next decades land became increasingly concentrated on fewer hands; the peasants continued to work on the land, giving landlords a share of the harvest. This led to both an increased level of Palestinian nationalism as well as civil unrest.Palestinian Private Property Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories Stacy Howlett, Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law (Volume 34 number 1, January 2001, retrieved August 14, 2006) At the same time, the area witnessed an increased flow of Jewish immigrants who did not restrict themselves to the cities where their concentration offered some protection from persecution. These Jews came hoping to create a new future in what they regarded as the homeland of their ancestors. Organizations created to aid Jewish settlement in Palestine bought land from Arab and absentee landowners. British Mandate World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire led to British control over the area in 1917, followed by the creation of the Mandate for Palestine by the League of Nations in 1922, which remained in effect until the establishment of Israel in 1948. During this period several new land laws were introduced, including The Land Transfer Ordinance of 1920, The Correction of Land Registers Ordinance of 1926 and The Land Settlement Ordinance of 1928.Kenneth W. Stein, \\"The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939\\" (1987), University of North Carolina Press, (excerpts: ) It was the policy of the Zionist Organisation to encourage Jewish acquisition of land in Palestine for Jewish settlement. For that purpose, the Fifth Zionist Congress (1901) set up the JNF to buy suitable land. The rules of the JNF forbade it from selling the land it acquired, but to lease it. Land owned by the JNF was leased to kibbutzim and other Jewish settlements on long-term leases. At the end of 1935, JNF held 89,500 acres (362 km¬≤) of land housing 108 Jewish communities. In 1939, 10% of the Jewish population of the British Mandate of Palestine lived on JNF land. JNF holdings by the end of the British Mandate period amounted to 936 km¬≤.Walter Lehn, The Jewish National Fund, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 3, No. 4. (Summer, 1974), pp. 74-96. By 1948, the JNF owned 54% of the land held by Jews in the region,Donald H. Akenson. \\"God's Peoples\\"; Cornell University Press, 1992, p.168 or a bit less than 4% of the land in Palestine (excluding Transjordan).Dan Leon.\\"The Jewish National Fund: How the Land Was ‚ÄòRedeemed‚Äô: The JNF‚Äôs historical concept of exclusively Jewish land is wholly anachronistic\\"; Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol 12 No. 4 & Vol 13 No. 1, 05/06 / From 1936, the British administration introduced a series of land regulations: The Land Transfer Regulations of 1940 divided the country into zones, with different restrictions on land sales in each. As summarized by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946, > In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony > hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. > In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a > Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted > at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, > consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the > most fertile areas- land sales remained unrestricted.Anglo-American > Committee of Inquiry report: Appendix IV; copy at The Inquiry recommended the repeal of the Regulations, without effect. State of Israel After the Israel's declaration of independence on 14 May 1948, state lands of the Mandate reverted to the State of Israel. In addition, property left by Arab refugees passed into the control of the new Israeli government. The newly formed Israeli ministries, committees and departments took over functions performed earlier by ‚ÄòNational Institutions‚Äô. One of the first steps adopted by the new state was the reactivation of the Defence [Emergency] Regulations adopted earlier by the British in 1939 (and later repealed). Since British regulations had applied to the whole country, the Government of Israel passed the Law and Administration Ordinance [Amendment] Law [1948] to reverse the British repeal and reinstate these Emergency Regulations. Some of this land was sold by the government to the JNF, which had developed expertise in reclaiming and developing waste and barren lands and making them productive. In 1960, under Basic Law: Israel Lands, JNF-owned land and government-owned land were together defined as \\"Israel lands,\\" and the principle was laid down that such land would be leased rather than sold. The JNF retained ownership of its land, but administrative responsibility for the JNF land and government-owned land, passed to a newly created agency called the Israel Land Administration or ILA. The lease principle is hardly new to the area however as it was practiced for centuries under the Ottoman tapu system. To this day, the Land Registration Office is commonly known in Israel as the tabu, the Arabic pronunciation of the Turkish tapu.State, society, and land in Jordan, Michael R. Fischbach Emergency laws and regulations Proclamation, 5708-1948 The proclamation repealed the White Paper of 1939 and sections 13 and 15 of the Immigration Ordinance of 1941.

The law repealed sections 13 to 15 of the 1941 Immigration Ordinance and regulations 102 to 107C of the 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations, in order to allow Jews who entered the country illegally under Mandate to remain as legal immigrants. The 1940 Land Transfers Regulations were repealed retroactively from 18 May 1939, to allow unregistered transfers to be filed. In 1967, the law was used for de facto annexation of East Jerusalem.Michael Dumper, The politics of Jerusalem since 1967, p. 39-41. Columbia University Press (1997). Area of Jurisdiction and Powers Ordinance, 5708-1948 After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Area of Jurisdiction and Powers Ordinance, 5708-1948, extended Israeli land laws to \\"any part of Palestine which the Minister of Defence has defined by proclamation as being held by the Defence Army of Israel\\"Ruling Palestine, A History of the Legally Sanctioned Jewish-Israeli Seizure of Land and Housing in Palestine.

Abandoned Areas Ordinance, 5708-1948 (published 30 June 1948, effective retroactively from 16 May 1948) defined an \\"abandoned area\\" as \\"any area or place conquered by or surrendered to armed forces or deserted by all or part of its inhabitants, and which has been declared by order to be an abandoned area\\". The Ordinance also provided for regulating \\"the expropriation and confiscation of movable and immovable property, within any abandoned area\\". The government was authorised to determine what would be done with this property. Defence (Emergency) Regulations  Article 125 Article 125 states: > A Military Commander may by order declare any area or place to be a closed > area for the purposes of these regulations.

According to Kirshbaum, the law was used to exclude a land owner from his own land so that it could be expropriated under the Land Acquisition (Validation of Acts and Compensation) Law (1953).Kirshbaum, David A. Israeli Emergency Regulations and The Defense (Emergency) Regulations of 1945. Israel Law Resource Center, February, 2007 Emergency Regulations (Security Zones) Law, 5709-1949 According to the Journal of Palestine Studies, the law designated an area as \\"security zone\\" which meant that no one could permanently live in, enter, or be in said zone.Apartheid, Israeli Style. Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 11, No. 4, [Also Vol. 12, no. 1]. Special Issue: The War in Lebanon (Summer, 1982), pp. 270-273 According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 40), \\"this measure was used extensively in various parts of the country, including areas in the Galilee, near the Gaza Strip and close to the borders. Lands so acquired would often be sold to the JNF. These regulations remained in place until 1972.\\" Emergency Regulations (Cultivation of Waste [Uncultivated] Lands) Law, 5709-1949  According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 40) this law (in Hebrew: ◊™◊ß◊†◊ï◊™ ◊©◊¢◊™ ◊ó◊ô◊®◊ï◊ù (◊¢◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ì ◊ê◊ì◊û◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ï◊ë◊®◊ï◊™)) was originally enacted in 1948 and amended in 1951 as the Emergency Regulations (Cultivation of Waste Lands) Law, 5711-1951. This law authorises the Ministry of Agriculture to declare lands as ‚Äòwaste‚Äô lands (Article 2) and to take control over ‚Äòuncultivated‚Äô lands (Article 4). Article 2 states: > The Minister of Agriculture may warn the owner of waste land to cultivate > the land or to ensure-that it is cultivated. Article 4 reads: > If the owner of the waste land does not apply to the Minister of Agriculture > as specified in regulation 3, or if the Minister of Agriculture is not > satisfied that the owner of the land has begun or is about to begin or will > continue to cultivate the land, the Minister of Agriculture may assume > control of the land in order to ensure its cultivation. COHRE and BADIL (p. 40) consider that \\"this law operated in conjunction with other laws including those declaring ‚Äòsecurity areas‚Äô. Once people (Arabs) were barred from their lands, these could be defined as ‚Äòuncultivated‚Äô and seized\\". Emergency Land Requisition (Regulation) Law, 5710-1949  This law repeals the earlier Emergency Regulations (Requisition of Property) Law, 5709-1948. The law authorises the requisition of land when (Article 3): > ...the making of the order is necessary for the defence of the state, public > security, the maintenance of essential supplies or essential public > services, the absorption of immigrants or the rehabilitation of ex-soldiers > or war invalids. The law includes clauses concerning the requisition of houses (chapter three), and states (Article 22b) that: > A competent authority may use force to the extent required for the carrying > into effect of an order made by a competent authority or a decision given by > an appeal committee under this Law. According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), \\"the law retroactively legalised land and housing requisitions that were carried out under existing emergency regulations. The law was amended in 1952 and 1953. A 1955 amendment, Land Requisition Regulation (Temporary Provision) Law, 5715- 1955, allows the Government to retain property seized under the law for longer than the three years originally specified. Along with a later (1957) amendment, the law also specified that any property held after 1956 would be determined to have been acquired on the basis of the British Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance of 1943. The 'Absentees Property Law' ‚ÄòAbsentees‚Äô property‚Äô laws were several laws which were first introduced as emergency ordinances issued by the Jewish leadership but which after the war were incorporated into the laws of Israel. As examples of the first type of laws are the Emergency Regulations (Absentees‚Äô Property) Law, 5709-1948 (December) which according to article 37 of the Absentees Property Law, 5710-1950 was replaced by the latter;See article 37 the Emergency Regulations (Requisition of Property) Law, 5709-1949, and other related laws.Ruling Palestine, A History of the Legally Sanctioned Jewish-Israeli Seizure of Land and Housing in Palestine. Publishers: COHRE & BADIL, May 2005, p. 41. According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), unlike other laws that were designed to establish Israel‚Äôs legal control over lands, this body of law focused on formulating a legal definition for the people (mostly Arabs) who had left or been forced to flee from these lands. Specific laws in this category include: *The Absentees‚Äô Property Law, 5710- 1950 *The Land Acquisition (Validation of Acts and Compensation) Law, 5713-1953 *Absentees‚Äô Property (Eviction) Law, 5718-1958 *Absentees‚Äô Property (Amendment No.3) (Release and Use of Endowment Property) Law, 5725-1965 *Absentees‚Äô Property (Amendment No. 4) (Release and Use of Property of Evangelical Episcopal Church) Law, 5727-1967 *Absentees‚Äô Property (Compensation) Law, 5733-1973 As a result, two million dunams were confiscated and given to the custodian, who later transferred the land to the development authority. This law created the novel citizenship category of \\"present absentees\\" (nifkadim nohahim), persons present at the time but considered absent for the purpose of the law. These Israeli Arabs enjoyed all civil rights-including the right to vote in the Knesset elections-except one: the right to use and dispose of their property. About 30,000-35,000 Palestinians became \\"present absentees\\".Benvenisti, Meron (2002): Sacred Landscape. University of California Press, p.201 According to Simha Flapan,Flapan, Simha (1987): The Birth of Israel, Myths and Realities. London and Sydney: Croom Helm, 1987 \\"a detailed account of exactly how abandoned Arab property assisted in the absorption of the new immigrants was prepared by Joseph Schechtman\\": > It is difficult to overestimate the tremendous role this lot of abandoned > Arab property has played in the settlement of hundreds of thousands of > Jewish immigrants who have reached Israel since the proclamation of the > state in May 1948.

It also considerably relieved the financial burden of > absorption.Schechtman, Joseph (1952): The Arab Refugee Problem. New York, > pp. 95-96, 100-01. How much of Israel's territory consists of land confiscated with the Absentee Property Law is uncertain and much disputed. Robert Fisk interviewed the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property, who estimates this could amount to up to 70% of the territory of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip: :The Custodian of Absentee Property does not choose to discuss politics. But when asked how much of the land of the state of Israel might potentially have two claimants ‚Äî an Arab and a Jew holding respectively a British Mandate and an Israeli deed to the same property ‚Äî Mr. Manor [the Custodian in 1980] believes that 'about 70 percent' might fall into that category (Robert Fisk, 'The Land of Palestine, Part Eight: The Custodian of Absentee Property', The Times, December 24, 1980, quoted in his book Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War). The Jewish Virtual Library, estimates that Custodial and Absentee land comprises 12% of Israel's total territory. The Jewish National Fund, from Jewish Villages in Israel, 1949: > Of the entire area of the State of Israel only about 300,000-400,000 dunums > -- apart from the desolate rocky area of the southern Negev, at present > quite unfit for cultivation -- are State Domain which the Israeli Government > took over from the Mandatory regime.

Jerusalem. pg XXI. The absentee property played an enormous role in making Israel a viable state. In 1954, more than one third of Israel's Jewish population lived on absentee property and nearly a third of the new immigrants (250,000 people) settled in urban areas abandoned by Arabs. Of 370 new Jewish settlements established between 1948 and 1953, 350 were on absentee property (Peretz, Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, 1958). The Absentees‚Äô Property Law, 5710- 1950 This law replaced the Emergency Regulations (Absentees‚Äô Property) Law, 5709-1948. According to Sabri Jiryis (p. 84),Jiryis, Sabri (1981): Domination by the Law. Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 11, No. 1, 10th Anniversary Issue: Palestinians under Occupation. (Autumn, 1981), pp. 67-92. the definition of \\"absentee\\" in the law was framed in such a way as to ensure that it applied to every Palestinian or resident in Palestine who had left his usual place of residence in Palestine for any place inside or outside the country after the adoption of the partition of Palestine resolution by the UN. Article 1(b) states that \\"absentee\\" means: > \\"absentee\\" means - > (1) a person who, at any time during the period between the 16th Kislev, > 5708 (29th November, 1947) and the day on which a declaration is published, > under section 9(d) of the Law and Administration Ordinance, 5708-1948(1), > that the state of emergency declared by the Provisional Council of State on > the 10th Iyar, 5708 (19th May, 1948) > (2) has ceased to exist, was a legal owner of any property situated in the > area of Israel or enjoyed or held it, whether by himself or through another, > and who, at any time during the said period - > :(i) was a national or citizen of the Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, SaudiArabia, > Trans-Jordan, Iraq or the Yemen, or :(ii) was in one of these countries or > in any part of Palestine outside the area of Israel, or :(iii) was a > Palestinian citizen and left his ordinary place of residence in Palestine > ::(a) for a place outside Palestine before the 27th Av, 5708 (1st September, > 1948); or ::(b) for a place in Palestine held at the time by forces which > sought to prevent the establishment of the State of Israel or which fought > against it after its establishment; (2) a body of persons which, at any time > during the period specified in paragraph (1), was a legal owner of any > property situated in the area of Israel or enjoyed or held such property, > whether by itself or through another, and all the members, partners, > shareholders, directors or managers of which are absentees within the > meaning of paragraph (1), or the management of the business of which is > otherwise decisively controlled by such absentees, or all the capital of > which is in the hands of such absentees; According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), the provisions in the law made sure that the term 'person' did not apply to Jews. The law also applied to Arabs who had become citizens of the State of Israel but were not in their usual place of residence as defined by the law. In this case, they were referred to as 'present absentees' and many lost their lands. The Law then appointed a Custodianship Council for Absentees' Property, whose president was to be known as the Custodian of Absentees' Property (Article 2). The law then made these properties the legal holdings of the Custodian. According to Art. 4.(a)(2): > every right an absentee had in any property shall pass automatically to the > Custodian at the time of the vesting of the property; and the status of the > Custodian shall be the same as was that of the owner of the property. According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), those who were found to occupy property in violation of this law could be expelled, and those who built on such property could have their structures demolished. The law came to apply not only to Palestinians who fled but also to those who were away from their regular places of residence (as described in the previous paragraph). According to the Israel Government Yearbook, 5719 (1958) (p. 235), the \\"village properties\\" of absentee Arabs \\"which was appropriated by the Custodian of Absentees' Property\\" included \\"[the land of] some 350 completely abandoned or semi-abandoned [Arab] villages, the aggregate area of which was about three-quarters of a million dunums .... Among the agricultural properties were 80,000 dunums of abandoned groves... [and] more than 200,000 dunums of plantations were taken over by the custodian. \\"It was estimated that \\"the urban properties ... include[d] 25,416 buildings in which there are 57,497 dwellings and 10,727 business and trade premises.\\"Jiryis, Sabri (1981): Domination by the Law. Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 11, No. 1, 10th Anniversary Issue: Palestinians under Occupation. (Autumn, 1981), p. 89 According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), \\"estimates of the total amount of ‚Äòabandoned‚Äô lands to which Israel laid claim vary between 4.2 and 5.8 million dunum (4 200-5 800 km¬≤). Between 1948 and 1953 alone, 350 of the 370 new Jewish settlements were created on lands confiscated under the Absentees‚Äô Property Law.\\" The Absentees‚Äô Property Law underwent several amendments, including: * , * . Both amendments clarifying rental arrangements and tenant protection rights on such property. * and subsequent amendments to the latter. Land Acquisition (Validation of Acts and Compensation) Law, 5713-1953 According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 42), the Government of Israel did not automatically gain title to lands seized under the Absentees‚Äô Property Law. This was accomplished under the Land Acquisition (Validation of Acts and Compensation) Law, 5713-1953. This law legalised expropriations (retroactively in many cases) for military purposes or for the establishment of (Jewish) settlements. The law allows the Government to claim the property of lands which are not in the possession of its owner as of 1 April 1952. Article 2 (a) states: > Property in respect of which the Minister certifies by certificate under his > hand-- :(1) that on the 6th Nisan, 5712 (1st April, 1952) it was not in the > possession of its owners; and :(2) that within the period between the 5th > Iyar, 5708 (14th May, 1948) and the 6th Nisan, 5712 (Ist April 1952) it was > used or assigned for purposes of essential development, settlement or > security; and :(3) that it is still required for any of these purposes The further states the monetary compensation for those losing their lands and that in the case were the lands corresponded to agricultural lands, where those lands formed their main source of livelihood, lands elsewhere would be offered. Article 3 reads: > (a) The owners of acquired property are entitled to compensation therefore > from the Development Authority. The compensation shall be given in money, > unless otherwise agreed between the owners and the Development Authority. > The amount of compensation shall be fixed by agreement between the > Development Authority and the owners or, in the absence of agreement, by the > Court, as hereinafter provided. > (b) Where the acquired property was used for agriculture and was the main > source of livelihood of its owner, and he has no other land sufficient for > his livelihood, the Development Authority shall, on his demand, offer him > other property, either for ownership or for lease, as full or partial > compensation. A competent authority, to be appointed for this purpose by the > Minister, shall, in accordance with rules to be prescribed by regulations, > determine the category, location, area, and, in the case of lease, period of > lease (not less than 49 years) and the value of the offered property, both > for the purpose of calculating the compensation and for determination of the > sufficiency of such property for a livelihood. > (c) The provisions of subsection (b) shall add to, and not derogate from, > the provisions of subsection (a). According to Alexandre Kedar (p. 153), until 1959, compensation was calculated on the basis of the 1950 land values. The author cites a 1965 ILA report which shows that over 1.2 million dunum (about 1 200 km¬≤) of Arab land were taken in this manner.Kedar, Alexandre (1996): Israeli Law and the Redemption of Arab Land 1948-1969. Thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Juridical Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, May 1996. The Absentees‚Äô Property (Amendment No.3) (Release and Use of Endowment Property) Law, 5725-1965 This law extends the scope of the Absentees' Property Law and earlier regulations concerning the Muslim religious endowment, the Waqf. Article 29A (c) states: > For the purposes of this section and of sections 29B to 29H, \\"endowment > property\\" means Muslim waqf property being immovable property validly > dedicated. According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), it allows the Government to confiscate vast amounts of Muslim (charity) land and other properties, including cemeteries and mosques, and place them under Government administration. According to the law, income from these properties would be used in part to build institutions and provide services for the Muslim inhabitants in areas where such property is located. The law amends the 1950 law in the following way: > In section 4 of the Absentees' Property Law, 5710-1950(1) (hereinafter > referred to as \\"the principal Law\\"), the following subsection shall be > inserted after subsection (a): > :(1) Where any property is an endowment under any law, the ownership > thereof shall vest in the Custodian free from any restriction, qualification > or other similar limitation prescribed, whether before or after the vesting, > by or under any law or document relating to the endowment if the owner of > the property, or the person having possession or the right of management of > the property, or the beneficiary of the endowment, is an absentee. The > vesting shall be as from the 10th Kislev, 5709 (12th December, 1948) or from > the day on which one of the aforementioned becomes an absentee, whichever is > the later date. :(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not void any > restriction, qualification or other similar limitation prescribed by or > under this Law or imposed by the Custodian and shall not void any > transactions effected by him.\\". (b) This section shall have effect > retroactively as from the date of the coming into force of the principal > Law. According to Meron Benvenisti: > \\"Most Waqf property in Israel was expropriated under the Absentee proberty > Law (giving rise to the sarcastic quip -\\"Apparently God is an absentee [in > Israel]\\") and afterward handed over to the Development Authority, ostensibly > because this was necessary to prevent its being neglected, but actually so > as to make it possible to sell it. Only about one-third of Muslim Waqf > property, principally mosques and graveyards that were currently in use, was > not expropriated. In 1956 its administration was turned over to the Board of > Trustees of the Muslim Waqf, which by then was made up of collaborators > appointed by the authorities. These \\"trustees\\" would sell or \\"exchange\\" land > with the ILA without any accountability to the Muslim community. Anger over > these deeds led to acts of violence within the community, including > assassinations.\\".Benvenisti, Meron (2000): Sacred Landscape. University of > California Press, p.297-298 The Absentees‚Äô Property (Compensation) Law, 5733-1973 This law establishes the procedure to compensate owners of lands which have been confiscated under the Absentees‚Äô Property Law (1950). It establishes the requirements to be eligible for compensation (Article 1): > The persons entitled to compensation are all those who were Israel residents > on 1 July 1973, or became residents thereafter, and prior to the property > becoming vested in the Custodian of Absentees' Property were :1.the owners > of property, including their heirs, or :2.the tenants only of urban > property, including spouses living with them at the last mentioned date, or > :3.the lessees of property, or :4.the owners of any easement in property. Other provisions specify the time limit legally allowed for filing a claim, whether compensation would be awarded in cash or bonds (depending on circumstances), the payment schedule (generally over a fifteen-year period) and other provisions. Appended to the law is a detailed schedule of how compensation is to be calculated for each type of property, urban or agricultural. Some provisions of this law were amended in later years.Ruling Palestine, A History of the Legally Sanctioned Jewish-Israeli Seizure of Land and Housing in Palestine. Publishers: COHRE & BADIL, May 2005, p. 42. Laws enacted to legalise further acquisition of depopulated lands, and related laws Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance (1943) This ordinance was originally enacted by the British in 1943 and later used by Israel to authorise the confiscation of lands for Government and ‚Äòpublic‚Äô purposes (see eminent domain). These included building Government offices, creating lands and parks, and suchlike. Kedar (p. 155) describes this law as ‚Äúthe main general land expropriation law in force in Israel today‚Äù. A 1964 amendment to this law, Acquisition for Public Purposes (Amendment of Provisions) Law, 5724-1964, specifies procedures to be followed in the acquisition of lands based on this and other laws, including the original Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance (1943), the Town Planning Ordinance (1936), and the Roads and Railways (Defence and Development) Ordinance (1943). The 1964 amendment also defines circumstances under which no compensation would be offered to those whose lands had been expropriated; generally, where the expropriation had occurred prior to the coming into force of this law. Additional amendments corrected various laws under which such lands might be expropriated, substituting Israeli laws for earlier British versions and clarifying rights to compensation. According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 43), Israel used this law extensively to expropriate Palestinians lands. Many Palestinians challenged the expropriations and did not accept compensation. A 1978 amendment to the law, Acquisition for Public Purposes (Amendment of Provisions) (Amendment No.3) Law, 5738-1978, addresses this issue by decreeing that where the owner refuses compensation or does not give consent within the time allotted, these funds would be deposited with the Administrator-General in the name of the owner. However, this provision has no bearing on the matter of the expropriation itself. According to the COHRE and BADIL study, lands acquired under this law were used for the building of new Jewish settlements or other ventures from which Arab Palestinians with Israeli citizenship were excluded. The Jewish-dominated sector of Upper Nazareth was created in this manner and was the subject of several lawsuits filed at the Supreme Court. According to Fast Magazine, with the law 40 percent of the owner‚Äôs land can be confiscated without compensation and public purposes are usually Jewish: From 1200 dunams confiscated in Nazareth for public purposes, 80 dunams were used for public buildings and the rest was used to build Jewish housing.Article in Fast Magazine Jerusalem Military Government (Validation of Acts) Ordinance, 5709-1949 According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), this law extends Israeli jurisdiction to ‚Äòthe Occupied Area of Jerusalem‚Äô (the western part of Jerusalem that was incorporated into Israel in 1948). It declares that all orders and regulations enacted by the Military Governor or other Government ministries shall be given the force of law. Development Authority (Transfer of Property) Law, 5710-1950 According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 42), the ‚ÄòAuthority for the Development of the Country‚Äô (or the ‚ÄòDevelopment Authority‚Äô) was established to work with relevant Government agencies to acquire and prepare lands for the benefit of newly arriving Jewish immigrants. Vast amounts of land allocated for this purpose were bought from the ‚ÄòCustodian of Absentee Property‚Äô. Pursuant to this law, lands passing into the hands of the State or to JNF control would be deemed inalienable. Article 3(4)(a) reads: > The Development Authority is competent: :to sell or otherwise dispose of, > let, grant leases of, and mortgage property;provided that ::(a) the > Development Authority shall not be authorised to sell, or otherwise transfer > the right of ownership of, property passing into public ownership, except to > the State, to the Jewish National Fund, to an institution approved by the > Government, for the purposes of this paragraph, as an institution for the > settlement of landless Arabs, or to a local authority; the right of > ownership of land so acquired may not be re-transferred except, with the > consent of the Development Authority, to one of the bodies mentioned in this > subparagraph; ::(b) the Development Authority shall not be authorised to > sell immovable property not being land passing into public ownership, unless > such property has first been offered to the Jewish National Fund, and the > Jewish National Fund has not agreed to acquire it within a period fixed by > the Development Authority; ::(c) the total area of immovable property, not > being land passing into public ownership, which the Development Authority > may sell, or the right of ownership of which it may otherwise transfer, > shall not exceed 100,000 dunams, but immovable property acquired by any of > the bodies mentioned in subparagraph (a) shall not be taken into account for > the purposes of this subparagraph; ::(d) the sale, or the transfer of the > right of ownership in any other way, of immovable property, being land > passing into public ownership or other immovable property, shall be effected > by decision of the Government in each individual case; Prescription Law, 5718-1958 The Prescription Law was first enacted in 1958 and amended in 1965. It repeals critical provisions of, and reverses British practices in relation to, the Ottoman Land Code (1858). According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 44), the Prescription Law is one of the most critical to understanding the legal underpinnings of Israel‚Äôs acquisition of Palestinian lands. Although not readily apparent in the language of the law, the purpose behind this legislation was to enable Israel to claim as ‚ÄòState lands‚Äô areas where Palestinians still predominated and where they could still assert their own claims on the land (for example, in the north of the country). The authors claim that this law, in conjunction with the Land (Settlement of Title) Ordinance (Amendment) Law, 5720-1960, the Land (Settlement of Title) Ordinance (New Version), 5729-1969 and the Land Law, 5729-1969, was designed to revise criteria related to the use and registration of Miri lands ‚Äì one of the most prevalent types in Palestine ‚Äì and to facilitate Israel‚Äôs acquisition of such land. Under this law, farmers are required to submit documentation proving uninterrupted cultivation of designated plots of land over a 15-year period (the ‚Äòprescription‚Äô period). Article 5 states: > The period within which a claim in respect of which an action has not been > brought shall be prescribed (such period being hereinafter referred to as > \\"the period of prescription\\") shall be :(1) in the case of a claim not > relating to land ‚Äî seven years; :(2) in the case of a claim relating to land > ‚Äî fifteen years or, if the land has been registered in the land register > after settlement of title in accordance with the Land (Settlement of Title) > Ordinance(1), twenty-five years. The law adds the proviso that lands purchased after 1 March 1943 would be subject to a 20-year verification period. The law also specifies a five-year hiatus between 1958 and 1963 that would not be counted toward this ‚Äòprescription‚Äô period. According to COHRE and BADIL, by 1963, much of the lands in question had still not been surveyed. Therefore, calculations of the requisite 20-year verification period were in effect halted, and the State was in a position to press its own claims to these lands. The authors consider that the Prescription Law had even more complex ramifications. For example, Israel decided that British aerial photographs of 1945 would be used to verify cultivation. Arab farmers who had not yet begun tilling their lands at the time the photographs were taken found they were by definition unable to meet the requisite 15-year ‚Äòprescription‚Äô period. Also, as Israel did not accept other evidence of cultivation, such as tax records, many Palestinians fell victim to a ‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô: in the process of trying to establish their legal ownership they (retroactively) lost their lands. According to COHRE and BADIL a 1965 report by the Israeli Land Administration (ILA) reflects on the rationale behind the law: > In the Northern area, there was a danger of the [acquisition of rights] by > prescription according to the Statute of Limitation (1958) regarding all > State land, and those [lands] of the Custodian of Absentee Property and the > Development Authority. Particularly in the area of the [Arab] minorities > where various elements began to take over State land and those of the > Development Authority, and [sic] there was worry that these lands would be > taken away from the hand of the ILA [Israeli Land Administration] and be > transferred to the ownership of the trespassers.Report of the Activity of > the ILA No. 4 (1964-1965), quoted in Kedar, p. 170.

In one sense, it was the Spartan Constitution, believed to have been formulated and established by the legendary lawgiver, Lycurgus. In the legend Lycurgus forbade any written constitution. It was therefore presumed to have been oral. In a second sense, the rhetra refers to an oracle of Delphi, which was believed to have contained the entire constitution in verse. The credo of being unwritten fails in this case, as a written record of all oracles was maintained by the priests at Delphi. They and others consulted it frequently. It survived long after the demise of the oracle but is missing now, except for fragments handed down by classical authors. The classical authors and the literate population of Sparta knew better than to suppose that the rhetra went into effect as written by an oracle and remained unchanged. A double tradition developed: tales of the oracular rhetra and stories of the laws of Lycurgus. As there is no history of any constitutional issues dividing the Spartans, they seem to have had no problem accepting its contradictions, perhaps because they knew it was legendary. Also, the concept of the constitution being truly oral and a state secret presents certain paradoxes, such as how the classical authors knew so much about it. Moreover, the workings of the government of a major Greek state over centuries cannot have been either unwritten or a secret. For example, Cyrus the Younger knew perfectly well that Lysander was forbidden by law to hold a second term as navarch, and yet he requested the Spartan government to make an exception. And finally, if the Spartans were forbidden to write anything down, the existence of inscriptions in the Eurotas valley becomes problematic. The institution of the rhetra in fact coincides with the innovation of the Greek alphabet based on the Phoenician alphabet. Genesis of the constitution Herodotus' version According to Herodotus,The History Book I Section 65. at some time before the reigns of Leon of Sparta and Agasicles, the Spartans \\"had been the very worst governed people in Greece.\\" Lycurgus, \\"a man of distinction among the Spartans,\\" decided to ask advice of the Delphic oracle. On reaching the inner sanctum of the temple, he heard: Thereupon the oracle delivered the entire constitution of Sparta, which Lycurgus took back and implemented. But, says Herodotus, the Lacedaemonians tell a different story. Lycurgus while regent for his nephew, Labotas, seized the opportunity to establish a new state. Imitating customs he found in Dorian Crete he innovated the Gerousia, the Ephorate, the Enomotiae, the Triacades and the Syssitia. Herodotus does not mention the oracle in the second report. The associated kings offer a rough date for the genesis of the Great Rhetra. Herodotus says the Rhetra predated the reigns of Agasicles and Leon, who acceded to their thrones about 590 BC. Labotas on the other hand began his reign in 870, implying an early 9th century date of the rhetra. If there was an oracle, the question of what writing system, if any, was the vehicle of the oracles is moot. Linear B was gone and the alphabet had not yet arrived in Greece. Plutarch's version The younger source, Plutarch, speaks less confidently of the details of Lycurgus' life, being faced by that time with multiple traditions, and having no way to judge between them. He says: \\"There is so much uncertainty in the accounts which historians have left us of Lycurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, that scarcely any thing is asserted by one of them which is not called into question or contradicted by the rest.\\" After repeating some of the opinions of sources available to him he launches into his own reconstruction based, he says, on the majority opinion. Lycurgus was the younger son of the Eurypontid king, Eunomus. He was thus passed over for the throne in favor of his brother, Polydectes, but the latter died. The inheritance changed by law to Lycurgus. However, Polydectes's wife having been found to be pregnant, Lycurgus became regent instead for the first several months of the infant Charilaus' life. There is no mention of the Agiad Labotas in this version.D. Ogden, \\"Crooked speech: the genesis of the Spartan rhetra,\\" JHS 114 (1994) 85‚Äì102.

His territory was Amstelland, and his son was Jan I.  Life  His family probably originated from Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, now in the province of North Holland, deriving their name from their castle on the River Amstel, and tried to create an independent principality between Utrecht and Holland. To this end Gijsbrecht IV‚Äîalong with the other powerful lords Zweder of Abcoude, Arnoud of Amstel, and Herman VI of Woerden‚Äîinstigated a revolt against Floris V, Count of Holland, and John I, Bishop-Elect of Utrecht. They held lands on the border with the adjacent Bisopric of Utrecht‚Äîthe area of Amsterdam, Abcoude, IJsselstein, and Woerden‚Äîat the expense of the bishop, and were backed by the craftsmen of Utrecht, the peasants of Kennemerland‚ÄîAlkmaar and surroundings‚ÄîWaterland, and Amstelland and the West Frisians. However, when Floris made a treaty with the craftsmen and made concessions to the peasants (Kennemerland was a duneland, where the farmers had far fewer rights then the farmers in the polders), the revolt was brought to an abrupt halt. In 1278, Floris captured Gjisbrecht and exiled Herman. The bishop of Utrecht eventually (in 1279 or 1281) also added the lands of the rebellious lords to Floris's territory in retribution. Gijsbrecht changed sides when opportune, and some accounts allege him to have been involved in Floris's later capture and assassination. After his resulting exile, he established himself probably in Oss in the Duchy of Brabant. He died in exile in Flanders, though Professor Pim de Boer at the University of Groningen has found serious, though not entirely conclusive, indications that Gijsbrecht‚Äîafter his exile, with a few followers‚Äîfounded Pruissisch Holland, not far from Elbing.  Popular culture  He was the eponymous hero of a play by Joost van den Vondel, Gijsbrecht van Aemstel. This was set during the siege of 1304, and switched him with his son Jan. Through this mistaken-identity, Gijsbrecht has become a hero of Amsterdam, with a statue in the Beurs van Berlage and a city park in southern Amsterdam named after him, the Gijsbrecht van Aemstelpark.

Branch location in Honolulu History Jodo Shinshu Buddhism was established in Hawaii as a result of the immigration of Japanese people to work the sugarcane plantations in Hawaii. The first Hongwanji temple in the Hawaiian islands was dedicated on March 3, 1889. In 1897, the Nishi Hongwanji in Kyoto, Japan began sending official ministers to establish temples for Japanese immigrants in Hawaii and the mainland United States. The first was Kenjun Miyamoto, who laid the groundwork for the ministry. Honi Satomi was the first priest, serving from 1898 until 1900, when he returned to Japan. Yemyo Imamura took over for Satomi in 1900, and served until his death in 1932. Since these early days, 36 temples have been established across the Hawaiian Islands, including the Honpa Hongwanji Hawaii Betsuin and the Honpa Hongwanji Hilo Betsuin. The mission operates the Hongwanji Mission School and Pacific Buddhist Academy. It is administered separately from the Buddhist Churches of America, the umbrella organization of Jodo Shinshu temples in the continental United States. In 1976, insurance executive Paul Yamanaka went to Yoshiaki Fujitani, Bishop of the Mission, with the idea to create a program called \\"Living Treasures of Hawai'i\\" modeled after the Living National Treasures program of Japan.

She died in 1964, just before her last book was published. A devout Roman Catholic, O'Connor often used religious themes in her work: Plot summary Ruby Turpin is a large Southern woman who is, like so many of O'Connor's characters, stuck in a narrow way of perceiving the world. She feels her actions and decisions make her superior to black people and those she calls \\"white trash.\\" The story opens as she and her husband Claud enter a doctor's crowded waiting room. She insists that he take the last vacant chair. She notices a dirty toddler with a runny nose lying across two seats and is quietly affronted that the child's dirty, uncouth mother doesn't make him move over for Mrs Turpin to sit. Mrs. Turpin strikes up a conversation with a \\"pleasant\\" woman who is there with her college age daughter, Mary Grace. The daughter is studying a book with the title Human Development, and only looks up from her reading to glare hatefully at Mrs Turpin. She and the woman chat about the importance of being hard working, clean, and having a good disposition. They also talk about being grateful and how it is important to be thankful for the good things you have been given in life. As the pleasant lady and Mrs Turpin chat, Mary Grace seems to grow angrier. The pleasant lady begins to speak about Mary Grace in the third person: \\"I know a girl ... whose parents would give her anything...\\" and obviously frustrated, says that \\"this girl\\" should be grateful for all she has in life. Claud then suggests that \\"this girl\\" ought to be paddled. Outraged, Mary Grace hurls the book, Human Development, at Mrs. Turpin. The book strikes Mrs. Turpin above her eye. Mary Grace then lunges across the table, and clutches Mrs Turpin's throat, choking her. The girl is subdued and given a sedative by the doctor and nurse who call an ambulance. Before Mary Grace succumbs to the sedative, Mrs Turpin feels the need to confront her: \\"What you got to say to me?\\" she asks Mary Grace. She looks into Mary Grace's eyes and has a feeling that Mary Grace has a knowing of her and a message to give. \\"Go back to hell where you came from, you old wart hog,\\" whispers Mary Grace as the sedative takes effect and she is taken away. Mrs. Turpin finds this comment very unsettling, and she wonders if it may have been a message from God, who may be trying to intervene in her life. Hating the notion, and still upset, she returns home. While hosing down her own hogs in their sty and obsessing on what she is terrified may be an intrinsically true message from God, Mrs. Turpin rages. She scolds God, demanding to know how she could possibly be herself (the upstanding, polite, good Christian she sees herself as) and a \\"wart hog\\" at the same time. As the sun sinks low in front of her, she angrily echoes Job's question to God: \\"Who do you think you are?\\" At that point the rays of the setting sun become a kind of road from the earth to the sky. She has a vision of redeemed souls winding their way to Heaven. Her vision is that she, Claud, and \\"proper\\" white Christians are at the back of the throng. In front of them, arriving in heaven first, are all the people Mrs Turpin considers inferior and unworthy of either her or God's love and at the rear of this parade into heaven she sees the faces of herself, Claud, and her proper Christian friends as they appear \\"shocked and altered.\\" This seems to be her revelation: that even what she considers to be basic human virtues are incomparable and expendable to God. Theme Ruby's feelings of superiority and love of self show that she thinks more of her own goodness than she does of God. She has a revelation from her interaction with Mary Grace that shows her a vision that her \\"moral superiority\\" means nothing if it does not come from her love of God and all of his children. Symbolism Flannery O'Connor uses the names of the characters in this story to aid the reader in identifying the true nature of the same characters. The word \\"turpitude\\" means ugliness and is suggestive of the ugliness of Mrs. Turpin's judgments on those she has contact with. She also has great contempt for the physical ugliness of those that she views as being beneath her. Yet the name Mary Grace is suggestive of the mother of Jesus, the Virgin Mary. This is the exact opposite of what Mrs. Turpin sees when she looks at the young woman that is acne covered and surly. The name Grace is also ironic with the complete lack of grace that is presented with the girl's appearance. The conclusion to the story shows that on the surface Mary Grace does not represent her name, but instead becomes a messenger of God's grace for Mrs. Turpin.

It took place on the weekend of May 25-27, 2007, at the 3.561 km Silverstone International Circuit in the United Kingdom. Troy Bayliss won the only Superbike race, as race 2 was cancelled because of heavy rain. Anthony West won the Supersport race. Races summary Heavy rains made for a wet first Superbike race and Supersport race at Silverstone and also caused the second Superbike race to be cancelled. Troy Bayliss took the win in the only Superbike race over Noriyuki Haga. Third was Troy Corser. Roberto Rolfo rode a good race to score fourth position, Regis Laconi took fifth place, his best result of the year so far. Max Biaggi finished sixth and Lorenzo Lanzi was seventh and the last rider not to be lapped by the Bayliss. Championship leader James Toseland crashed on lap three and he rejoined the race down in 18th place and eventually finished eighth. Ruben Xaus also fell on lap 24, allowing Toseland through, but also rejoined to finish ninth. Only 13 riders finished the race at Silverstone. In the Supersport race, Anthony West scored a fabulous win in only his second Supersport race, proving to be the clear victor by some 33 seconds from Robbin Harms. The race was red-flagged six laps earlier than scheduled when a fallen machine blocked the racing line. Katsuaki Fujiwara was the final podium finisher. Championship leader Kenan Sofuoƒülu fell on lap one and was ruled out of the points for the first time this year. Superbike race 1 classification {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" ! Pos ! No ! Rider !

It was broadcast on BBC One on 19 April 2008. It features the return of the Ood, who appeared in the second series episodes \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and \\"The Satan Pit\\". The episode takes place in the year 4126 on the Ood-Sphere, the titular planet of the episode. The Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) investigate Ood Operations, a company that is selling the Ood as a servant race, to discover the reason the Ood are happy to serve. When they find a group of unprocessed Ood, they become horrified at the alterations performed and resolve to free the Ood. The episode was well-received for its central theme of slavery. Plot The Tenth Doctor and Donna land on a planet called the Ood-Sphere in 4126, where a company called Ood Operations has been harvesting and selling the Ood as servants. Several people have been killed in the weeks before the Doctor arrived. The CEO of Ood Operations, Klineman Halpen, tells the Doctor the method of killing each time is identical: the victims are electrocuted by the Ood's translation spheres. One of the Red-Eye Ood, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. Donna becomes sympathetic to the Ood and is horrified by their enslavement. The Doctor also takes an interest in the Ood, noting that no species could naturally evolve to be servants. He and Donna travel through the complex and find a batch of uncultivated Ood singing together. Instead of a translation sphere, they hold a \\"hindbrain\\" that gives them individuality. This hindbrain is being removed and replaced with the translation sphere by the humans to make them subservient, and the Doctor rebukes Halpen for lobotomising the Ood. The Doctor and Donna are captured by Ood Operations' security force. Shortly after, the Ood begin a mass revolution and the complex is evacuated, but everyone from the complex is slaughtered en masse. The Doctor and Donna escape with some help from the Ood (after convincing them to resist their brainwashing) and follow Halpen to a locked warehouse that contains a large brain, which is revealed to be the Ood's collective consciousness. The brain's control of the Ood is limited by a circle of pylons emitting a forcefield. Halpen plans to kill the brain and by extension all of the Ood, but is stopped by the Doctor, Donna, and Dr. Ryder. Dr. Ryder reveals that he is secretly an activist for \\"Friends of the Ood\\", and had slowly infiltrated the company to gain access to the pylons and lower their force field to cause the revolution. Halpen is outraged at his betrayal, so he throws Dr. Ryder into the brain, killing him. Halpen's personal Ood servant, Ood Sigma, has been using Halpen's hair loss medication to slowly convert Halpen into an Ood. Ood Sigma tells the Doctor and Donna that he will take care of Halpen. The Doctor shuts down the pylons, freeing the Ood and allowing them all to sing in a telepathic collective. As the Doctor and Donna prepare to leave, Ood Sigma promises to include the \\"Doctor-Donna\\" in the Ood's song. He also tells the Doctor that his song will soon be ending. Continuity The red eye phenomenon in the Ood is a symptom of their being possessed. In \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and \\"The Satan Pit\\" they were under the Beast's control. The Ood-Sphere is in the same planetary system as the Sense- Sphere, the location for the 1964 serial The Sensorites; the Sensorites and Ood are visually and mentally similar. Production The episode was written by Keith Temple and directed by Graeme Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies had envisioned the Ood's return because their previous appearance, the 2006 two-part story \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and \\"The Satan Pit\\", had been overshadowed by the appearance of the Devil. Davies subsequently provided Temple with a brief for the episode which included the term \\"ice planet\\" and the storyline of a business selling the Ood as a commodity. Temple's drafts of the episode were described as \\"too dark\\" and \\"too old Doctor Who\\"; Temple stated on the episode's commentary that his early draft was \\"a six-part [serial] in 45 minutes\\". Temple and Davies thought that the episode was not a \\"fun reappearance\\" of an old monster; instead, they felt that there was \\"an actual story to tell\\". Temple emphasised in his script that the Doctor overlooked the Ood under the shadow of the Devil, and the character had to see his shortcomings. Temple's script also emphasised the Ood's slavery; both Temple and lead actor David Tennant commented that the existence of a species born to serve was complicated, the latter stating complications with Richard Dawkins' selfish gene theory. Donna's role in the episode was to further humanise the Doctor, and her opinion of the Ood changing from her initial disgust at their appearance to empathy for them was important to the episode and her character development. Susie Liggat cited the writing as part of Doctor Who's importance‚Äîshe thought the story about \\"liberating oppressed people\\" could be applied domestically or globally. The episode's antagonist, Klineman Halpen, is portrayed by Tim McInnerny. Davies considered his character‚Äî\\"a middle manager who's out of his depth\\"‚Äîa perfect villain. Temple described him as \\"narcissistic\\", \\"preening\\" and \\"ruthless ... without sentiment\\". McInnerny said \\"It's always nice to play a bastard... I'm glad Halpen's a three-dimensional bastard! That makes him interesting!\\". Temple epitomised Halpen in a scene where he kills an operative for the activist group \\"Friends of the Ood\\"; Davies and Tennant felt that his \\"disgusting\\" and \\"gothic ... Edgar Allan Poe\\" fate would be undeserved otherwise. Filming for the episode took place in August 2007. The opening and closing outdoor scenes were filmed in Trefil Quarry in the Brecon Beacons, the external scenes of the complex at Aberthaw Cement Works, and scenes in the \\"battery farm\\" were filmed in a hangar at RAF Saint Athan. CGI was used sparingly in production; the snow was paper snow adhered by water, and the Ood heads contained complex animatronics. McInnerny wore a prosthetic mask with two layers for his transformation scene though the production team's best boy provided motion capture for the computer-generated profile of the appendages coming out of his mouth when this needed to be refilmed and McInnerny was unavailable. Reception \\"Planet of the Ood\\" was the most watched programme in its timeslot, with 7.5 million viewers. The episode was the second most-watched programme of the day, beaten by Britain's Got Talent, and was the twelfth most watched programme of the week. The episode's Appreciation Index was 87 (considered Excellent). Scott Matthewman, writing for The Stage, gave a mixed review of the episode. He thought that \\"pretty much the only surprise in the way the humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards,\\" and \\"the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed.\\" However, he thought Donna was becoming \\"fast ... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series' history\\", and \\"there were some nice interpretations of the Ood‚Äôs natural development\\". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was \\"really really good ... ‚Äì one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'\\". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate \\"really, really isn‚Äôt that bad when she says [\\"We don't have slaves.\\"]\\". Ben Rawson- Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying \\"Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit,\\" citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode. He thought the episode as a whole \\"exemplifies just how powerful and emotive Doctor Who can be when writing, direction and performance are all harmonious and complete their own Ood-like circle\\", and was appreciative of the acting. The episode's only flaw was when Donna said \\"Why do you say 'Miss'? Do I look single?\\", but was otherwise \\"an extremely impressive, contemplative examination of the abhorrent nature of humanity\\".

The male is mostly dark brown with blackish streaking. The breast and throat are bright red and there is a white spot on the face near the base of the bill. The bold supercilium is white behind the eye and red in front of it. Females are paler than the males with the red markings restricted to a wash on the belly and the supercilium and throat are buff. It breeds in southern Chile and southern and western parts of Argentina. Some birds migrate northwards in winter. An endemic subspecies, L. loyca falklandica, occurs in the Falkland Islands, where it is known as the military starling.http://www.falklands.net/BirdGuideLongTailedMeadowLark.shtml Long- tailed meadowlarks are found in open habitats such as grassland where they forage on the ground, feeding mainly on invertebrates. The nest is made of dry grass and is built by the female. It is placed on or near the ground amongst grass. Whenever the female leaves the nest, she first walks a few meters from it hiding among the dry grass in order to prevent the nest from being found by predators who see her leave. The same method is used when arriving at the nest, she first lands a few meters from the nest and then walks towards it. Two clutches of two to four eggs are laid during the breeding season. They are bluish-white with dark blotches and streaks.

Although governments have various reasons for implementing such a policy, the main reason cited is improving accessibility for working- and middle-class students. A tuition fee freeze is a common political goal of the Canadian student movement, especially the Canadian Federation of Students. A tuition freeze is best known as a Canadian political construct, and can accurately be applied only to other countries that offer post-secondary education at a cost. However, the practice of regulating the rates paid by consumers, a formal regulatory process known as utility ratemaking, is carried out in many countries, including the United States, where many industries are classified as public utilities. Although the classification of public utilities has changed over time, typically such businesses must constitute a de facto monopoly (or \\"natural monopoly\\") for the services they provide within a particular jurisdiction. Since a monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity, it can be argued that colleges are an enterprise, or group of businesses that have sole access to a market of higher education, as they are the only supplier of a college degree, and are thus comparable to the monopoly of a group electric companies, who are the sole supplier of electricity. In Canada, where government regulation of college tuition is practiced, it is applied (currently) at the provincial level, as education (including post-secondary education) is a provincial responsibility under the division of powers between provincial and federal governments. Currently, the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland have tuition fee freezes in place. The provinces of British Columbia and Ontario have previously had tuition fee freezes.

He was one of nineteen sportsmen to achieve the Derbyshire Double of playing cricket for Derbyshire and football for Derby County, but died aged 26 as a result of an accident while playing football for Staveley. Cropper was born at Brimington, Derbyshire, the son of Thomas and Mary Cropper, and was a bricklayer.British Census 1881 He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1882 season. He also played for the North of England team. He shared most wickets for the club in the 1883, 1884, 1885 and 1886 seasons. In 1886, he played one football match for Derby County. Derbyshire lost first-class status for the 1888 season but Cropper continued playing for the side. Cropper played 113 innings in 60 first-class matches to score 1638 runs with an average of 15.00 and a top score of 93 not out. He took 171 first-class wickets, with an average of 17.13 and a best performance of 7 for 25. From 1888, Cropper played football for the Derbyshire side of Staveley. While playing for Staveley, on 12 January 1889 against Grimsby Town at Clee Park, Lincolnshire, Cropper collided with Dan Doyle, the Grimsby rightback, after fifteen minutes. He was badly injured by Doyle's knee in his abdomen and left the field in obvious distress. The collision resulted in a ruptured bowel and he died in the dressing room at Grimsby in the arms of his Staveley and Derbyshire County Cricket Club teammate George Hay. Cropper was buried in Brimington churchyard and a memorial stone was erected from the proceeds of a subscription fund raised by his family and friends which can still be seen today.

Generac's power systems range in output from 800 watts to 9 megawatts,2010 Generac Holdings Annual report and are available through independent dealers, retailers and wholesalers. Generac is headquartered in Waukesha, Wisconsin,HQ may now be based in Genesee, Wisconsin according to more recent publication: and has manufacturing facilities in Berlin, Oshkosh, Jefferson, Eagle, and Whitewater; all in Wisconsin.  History  Founded by Robert Kern in 1959, the company soon began producing portable generators for Sears, Roebuck and Co. under the Craftsman brand. During the 1970s, Generac expanded its offerings in the portable and recreational vehicle markets, and in the 1980s the company entered the commercial and industrial markets with its backup power generation systems. By end of the 1980s, the company was manufacturing residential, commercial and industrial generators, and in 1989, Generac introduced the first gaseous-fueled automatic home standby system. In 1992, Generac began private labeling generator sets for Caterpillar, Inc. As the partnership grew between the two companies, they discussed a potential acquisition of Generac by Caterpillar, although a deal was never finalized. In June 1996, Caterpillar decided to terminate the private labeling agreement. Generac then sued Caterpillar under the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law (\\"WFDL\\"), the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Wisconsin common law concerning restrictive covenants, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. The federal district court, in two separate orders, disposed of the action in Caterpillar's favor. Generac then challenged the lower court's rulings in the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Generac's claims were properly dismissed by the lower court. Generac continued to supply some transfer switches to Caterpillar until 2002, when Caterpillar changed suppliers. In 1998, Generac sold its portable products division to the Beacon group, a private equity firm, who later sold it to Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Upon expiration of a non-compete agreement related to the sale in 2007, Generac re-entered the portable generator market in 2008. In late 2006, Generac was purchased by CCMP Capital of New York. In 2009 CCMP took a write- off, described as a non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charge, of $583.5 million against their purchase of Generac.GENERAC HOLDINGS INC. - FORM S-1/A - January 25, 2010 Aaron Jagdfeld was appointed president and chief executive officer in September, 2008 and is the current CEO.

Scientific frame of the network  The network scientific priorities relate to the following global issues : *An increased demand for plants, for both food and non-food purposes *The necessary adaption of crops to climate change *The prevention of risks such as plant pests and diseases, diminishing natural resources, risks related to food safety, social risks‚Ä¶ The network is composed of high level scientific teams, organized in two tightly connected fields : *Plant integrative biology, in the broadest sense: genetics and genomics, plant breeding, ecophysiology; plant pests and diseases, integrated crop protection, population ecology‚Ä¶ *Socio-technical dynamics of innovation : agri-environmental innovation, food industry innovation, social innovation and social management of innovation The thematics involved are centering on the plant : the plant, from the gene to the whole plant ; the plant in its environment; plant products and their food and non-food uses‚Ä¶ A network of research Units In 2007, the network is composed of 29 research units (including 19 joint research units and 10 in-house research units); Approx. 780 scientists are involved : *580 scientists belonging to the three initial founding institutions (500 working in Montpellier and Avignon and 80 scientists abroad). *200 scientists from partner institutions of the joint research units (CNRS, IRD, the University of Montpellier I and II, the University of Avignon, and CIHEAM-IAMM) Aims of the Foundation The Foundation is aiming at *increasing the international openness, attractiveness and renown of the Montpellier agronomic research complex especially by attracting high level foreign scientists and by contributing to the development of international cooperation projects. *stimulating the collaboration between the research units in the network. *strengthening the offer in education through research especially towards students from emerging and developing countries To fulfill these aims, the foundation will support incoming high level foreign scientists, finance post-doctoral and doctoral positions, contribute to the development of structuring technological projects (i.e. technical platforms, shared equipment‚Ä¶), support thematic training sessions and scientific events of international importance, as well as various others actions (release from teaching duties, support for the setting up of international projects ‚Ä¶). The Foundation‚Äôs actions are to be linked to those of the Agropolis International association to allow Montpellier institutions involved in agricultural sciences as a whole (totalizing approx. 2300 scientists) to reach the same international repute as other agricultural research institutes at European (e.g. Wageningen University, with 1400 scientists) or international (e.g. the CGIAR centers network, with 1800 scientists) level. For example, since 2009 the foundation is part of the consortium supporting Pl@ntNet, an app for automatic plant identification through photographs.

Its courses include postgraduate education. History The Kyiv Conservatory was founded on 3 November 1913 at the Kyiv campus of the Music College of the Russian Musical Society. The initiative to create the Conservatory belongs to P. Tchaikovsky, who in 1891 wrote the submission to the Emperor of Russia, arguing the necessity to open an institution of higher musical education in Kyiv. The organization of the conservatory was spearheaded by Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Glazunov. The first directors were V. Pukhalsky (1913) and Reinhold Gli√®re (1914‚Äì1920). In 1925, the junior classes were separated from the conservatory to form a Music College, while the senior classes were merged into the formerly private Music and Drama Institute of Mykola Lysenko (today the Kyiv National I. K. Karpenko-Kary Theatre, Cinema and Television University). Viktor Kosenko taught at both institutions. The conservatory was revived when Kyiv once again became the capital of Ukraine in 1934. The Music and Drama Institute of Mykola Lysenko was dissolved and its music department was merged back with the Music College, while the drama department served as the basis for creation of the Kyiv State Theater Institute of Les Kurbas. In 1938, the conservatory received the Order of Lenin award. In 1940, the conservatory was named after Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. In 1995, the President of Ukraine elevated the conservatory's status, and renamed it the Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine. The conservatory occupies a building built in the 1890s as the Hotel Continental (architects Eduard Bradtman and Georg Schleifer). The building was destroyed during World War II, but was rebuilt in 1955, at which point a concert hall was added (architects L. Katok and Ya. Krasny). It is located on Horodetsky street 1-3/11.

History of the term  In their original appearance in the prefaces of the Kokin wakash≈´, the six rokkasen are not actually referred to with this term. There are numerous phrases that show the conceptualization of these six as a cohesive group, but the term \\"Rokkasen\\" first appeared in an early Kamakura-period commentary on Kokin wakash≈´, titled Sanry≈´sh≈ç ‰∏âÊµÅÊäÑ.  Members  The members of the rokkasen, and their total poems in Kokin wakash≈´, are as follows: *≈åtomo no Kuronushi, 3 poems *Ono no Komachi, 18 poems *Ariwara no Narihira, 30 poems *Kisen H≈çshi, 1 poem *S≈çj≈ç Henj≈ç, 17 poems *Fun'ya no Yasuhide, 1 poem  Tsurayuki's Criticism  In his prefaces to the anthology Kokin wanash≈´, Ki no Tsurayuki first praises two poets, Kakinomoto no Hitomaro and Yamabe no Akahito, from the period before the rokkasen and then praises these six poets of the generation preceding his own, but also critiques what he considers to be weaknesses in their personal styles. His criticism in both prefaces is as follows: Kana preface Mana preface There are varying theories on both why Tsurayuki chose these six poets and why he chose to criticize them in this manner. Helen McCullough claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of Han Dynasty poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources. Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (kokoro ÂøÉ) and words (kotoba Ë®ÄËëâ).  Legacy  The concept of the rokkasen had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods. In 1009‚Äì1011, Fujiwara no Kint≈ç compiled an expanded list known as the Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry, which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the \\"Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry,\\" and the \\"Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry.\\" Many Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of waka poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the waka anthologies Man'y≈çsh≈´ and Kokin wakash≈´. When discussing the waka poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (ÂÖ≠Ê≠å‰ªôÊôÇ‰ª£ rokkasen jidai), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of Emperor K≈çk≈ç, but disagree on whether it begins with Emperor Ninmy≈ç or Emperor Montoku. Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ry≈çji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmy≈ç is the better choice for the start of this periodization. Additionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, ≈åtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, Hyakunin issh≈´.

Life Born in Schwerin in the former East Germany, Norbert Bleisch was the second child of the Bleisch family. His father was a local official and his mother was a homemaker. Bleisch was raised Catholic by his mother, attending religious school twice a week for ten years as well as Sunday mass. He spent his childhood mostly in his own company, and when he came into puberty at an early age he knew nothing about sexual matters. He secretly enjoyed watching his friends when they went skinny-dipping; however, the shy boy did not participate. At 19 he often participated in competitive cycling, and at that time he had a heavy crush on a 14-year-old boy who was among his fellow cyclists. Bleisch was a skilled plasterwork professional and worked as musician, theatrical stagehand, nurse and lifeguard. He became known in East Germany with his first book, Kontrollverlust. In April 1991 he was awarded the Alfred D√∂blin Achievement Award for Viertes Deutschland. In 2004 Bleisch changed his last name to that of his wife and has since been published as Norbert Leithold. Arrest and conviction Bleisch's filming career came to an abrupt halt when he was arrested on 16 September 1996 during the filming of five boys being intimate in a hangar in Ludwigslust. Some of the parents of Bleisch's models had become suspicious about their sons' activities with the director and the police had initiated a criminal investigation. On 20 May 1997 Sebastian Bleisch was sentenced to two-and-a-half years' detention by the regional court in Schwerin for having used adolescents who were still under 16 years old in the 60 or so pornographic films he had directed since 1990. He evaded conviction on more serious charges, however, after the defence showed that the boys had approached Bleisch willingly and no psychological harm had occurred. While Bleisch served his sentence in the B√ºtzow Penal Institution he wrote a trilogy of novels for which a publisher has not yet been found.Norbert B.: Sebastian B..

History The predecessor of the province was Vyborg Governorate, which was established in 1744 from territories ceded by the Swedish Empire to Russia in 1721 (Treaty of Nystad) and in 1743 (Treaty of √Öbo). These territories originated as parts of the Viborg and Nyslott County and Kexholm County in 1721, and parts of the Savolax and Kymmeneg√•rd County in 1743. The governorate was also known as Old Finland. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Kingdom of Sweden had allied itself with the Russian Empire, United Kingdom and other parties against Napoleonic France. However, following the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Russia made peace with France. In 1808, supported by France, Russia successfully challenged Swedish control over Finland in the Finnish War. In the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809, Sweden was obliged to cede all its territory in Finland east of the Torne River to Russia. The ceded territories became a part of the Russian Empire and were reconstituted into the autonomic Grand Duchy of Finland, with the Russian Tsar as Grand Duke. In 1812, the territories of the Vyborg Governorate were transferred from Russia proper to the Grand Duchy of Finland and established as Viipuri Province. The transfer announced by Tsar Alexander I just before Christmas, on December 23, 1811 O.S. (January 4, 1812 N.S.), can be seen as a symbolic gesture and an attempt to appease the sentiment of the Finnish population, which had just experienced Russian conquest of their country by force. Siestarjoki was transferred to Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1864. When Finland became independent from Russia in 1917, the status of Viipuri Province remained unchanged. The provincial capital, Vyborg (, ), was at this time the fourth largest city in Finland. World War II On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland and started World War II. On September 17, 1939, the USSR, in accordance with the secret protocols of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, invaded Poland from the east. Within months, the Soviet Union launched a war against Finland. As a result of this war, Finland was forced to cede territory, including parts of Viipuri Province, to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty in early 1940. Finland lost its natural border along the Rajajoki River () in the south. 22,973 km2, or 71.5 percent of the province on the Karelian Isthmus, including the cities of Viipuri and Sortavala, became part of the newly established Karelo-Finnish SSR in the Soviet Union. Following the peace treaty, the entire population of the ceded territories, more than four hundred thousand people, was evacuated to central Finland. In 1941 the Continuation War broke out and Finland recaptured the territories, but in 1944 its forces were pushed back and by the Moscow Armistice on September 19, 1944, and the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947 the territorial losses were confirmed again. Winter war evacuees had returned following the Finnish offensive in 1941 and were evacuated again in 1944 after the Soviet counterattack, and the territories were repopulated by people from other parts of the Soviet Union. This time, the Karelian Isthmus became part of the Vyborgsky and Priozersky districts of the Leningrad Oblast, and only Ladoga Karelia and Border Karelia became part of the Karelo-Finnish SSR. While Ladoga Karelia retained most of its original toponyms, the vast majority of toponyms in the Karelian Isthmus were renamed by the Soviet government around 1948. In 1945 the parts of the province that remained in Finnish hands were renamed Kymi Province, with its center at Kouvola. The Kymi Province was in turn merged with other provinces into the larger Southern Finland Province in 1997.

In 1856 Saimaa Canal (, Saymensky kanal) was opened, linking Lake Saimaa and Finnish Lakeland to the Vyborg Bay. The development of the province was bolstered further by the construction of the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìRiihim√§ki railroad in 1870, the Viborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad in 1894 and the Petrograd‚ÄìHiitola railroad in 1917. Granite, marble (in Ruskeala) and bog iron mining as well as logging were important branches of industry. Starting from the beginning of the 20th century, a number of hydroelectric power plants were built by Enso in the higher reaches of the River Vuoksi to supply its pulp and paper mills.

Continuity is a nice property for (the sample paths of) a process to have, since it implies that they are well-behaved in some sense, and, therefore, much easier to analyze. It is implicit here that the index of the stochastic process is a continuous variable. Some authorsDodge, Y. (2006) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. (Entry for \\"continuous process\\") define a \\"continuous (stochastic) process\\" as only requiring that the index variable be continuous, without continuity of sample paths: in some terminology, this would be a continuous-time stochastic process, in parallel to a \\"discrete-time process\\". Given the possible confusion, caution is needed. Definitions Let (Œ©, Œ£, P) be a probability space, let T be some interval of time, and let X : T √ó Œ© ‚Üí S be a stochastic process. For simplicity, the rest of this article will take the state space S to be the real line R, but the definitions go through mutatis mutandis if S is Rn, a normed vector space, or even a general metric space. Continuity with probability one Given a time t ‚àà T, X is said to be continuous with probability one at t if :\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\left \\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} \\\\big X_{s} (\\\\omega) - X_{t} (\\\\omega) \\\\big = 0 \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) = 1. Mean-square continuity Given a time t ‚àà T, X is said to be continuous in mean-square at t if E[Xt2] < +‚àû and :\\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[ \\\\big X_{s} - X_{t} \\\\big^{2} \\\\right] = 0. Continuity in probability Given a time t ‚àà T, X is said to be continuous in probability at t if, for all Œµ > 0, :\\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\left \\\\big X_{s} (\\\\omega) - X_{t} (\\\\omega) \\\\big \\\\geq \\\\varepsilon \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) = 0. Equivalently, X is continuous in probability at time t if :\\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\big X_{s} - X_{t} \\\\big}{1 + \\\\big X_{s} - X_{t} \\\\big} \\\\right] = 0. Continuity in distribution Given a time t ‚àà T, X is said to be continuous in distribution at t if :\\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} F_{s} (x) = F_{t} (x) for all points x at which Ft is continuous, where Ft denotes the cumulative distribution function of the random variable Xt. Sample continuity X is said to be sample continuous if Xt(œâ) is continuous in t for P-almost all œâ ‚àà Œ©. Sample continuity is the appropriate notion of continuity for processes such as It≈ç diffusions. Feller continuity X is said to be a Feller-continuous process if, for any fixed t ‚àà T and any bounded, continuous and Œ£-measurable function g : S ‚Üí R, Ex[g(Xt)] depends continuously upon x. Here x denotes the initial state of the process X, and Ex denotes expectation conditional upon the event that X starts at x. Relationships The relationships between the various types of continuity of stochastic processes are akin to the relationships between the various types of convergence of random variables. In particular: * continuity with probability one implies continuity in probability; * continuity in mean-square implies continuity in probability; * continuity with probability one neither implies, nor is implied by, continuity in mean-square; * continuity in probability implies, but is not implied by, continuity in distribution. It is tempting to confuse continuity with probability one with sample continuity. Continuity with probability one at time t means that P(At) = 0, where the event At is given by :A_{t} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\left \\\\lim_{s \\\\to t} \\\\big X_{s} (\\\\omega) - X_{t} (\\\\omega) \\\\big eq 0 \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, and it is perfectly feasible to check whether or not this holds for each t ‚àà T. Sample continuity, on the other hand, requires that P(A) = 0, where :A = \\\\bigcup_{t \\\\in T} A_{t}. A is an uncountable union of events, so it may not actually be an event itself, so P(A) may be undefined! Even worse, even if A is an event, P(A) can be strictly positive even if P(At) = 0 for every t ‚àà T. This is the case, for example, with the telegraph process.

It has a population of 81. History of the town Kristianopel (old spelling Christianopel) is located in the easternmost part of Blekinge, which was the easternmost part of Denmark in beginning of the 17th century. The town of Avask√§r, located just a few hundred metres north of present-day Kristianopel, was too difficult to defend from Swedish attacks. The Danish king Christian IV had a fortress built south of it in 1603 and named it after his newborn son - Prince Christian (1603‚Äì1647) or Kristian, with Danish spelling.Michael Roberts (1953) Gustavus Adolphus. A History of Sweden 1611-1632. Volume one: 1611-1626 (London: Pearson Longman) The Germanised Greek suffix '-opel' was given to give the town a cosmopolitan ring similar to Constantinople. Construction of the town was completed in 1606 and held approximately 700 inhabitants. During the Kalmar War, prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (1594‚Äì1632), took the town with a small force on June 25, 1611 and destroyed the supplies the Danes had stored there. The town was burned down and the church was demolished. The city privileges of Avask√§r and neighboring Lyck√• were transferred to Kristianopel in 1622, and the town was fortified in 1637. Lyck√• Castle was demolished in order to use it as building material at Kristianopel. Kristianopel Church (Kristianopels Kyrka) or Church of the Holy Trinity was rebuilt between 1618 and 1624. The building was retrieved limestone and granite from √ñland and bricks from nearby N√§ttraby. It is the only preserved building from the time when Kristianopel was a fortified city and the last outpost of the Danish kingdom at the border to Sweden. Kristianopel's significance as a frontier fortress vanished when Blekinge became Swedish as a consequence of the treaty of Roskilde in 1658 and in 1676 the fortress' equipment was transferred to Karlshamn. September 25 that same year the abandoned fortress was taken by Danish lieutenant colonel L√ºtzow, who began shoring up the partially demolished fortifications and made Kristianopel a strongpoint for the Snapphane guerrilla. L√ºtzow was forced to yield Kristianopel on February 22, 1677, whereupon the fortress was razed to the ground and the burghers commanded to move to other towns. The town was declared dangerous to the security of Sweden, and in 1678 an order decreed that no building be left standing in Kristianopel. The remaining inhabitants were resettled in Ronneby, V√§xj√∂, and Karlshamn.

He co-founded the NO!Art movement which calls for socially and politically involved art that would resist and combat the forces of the market. His controversial work, often related to the Holocaust, has frequently irritated critics and curators. Though he lived as a penniless artist, Lurie amassed $80 million by buying penny stocks and real estate which was used on August 8, 2009, to create the Boris Lurie Art Foundation. Early life Lurie was born in Leningrad into a Jewish family and grew up in Riga. From 1941 to 1945 he was imprisoned in the Riga Ghetto, then the Lenta Arbeitslager, and then three separate concentration camps, including Salaspils, Stutthof, and the Buchenwald satellite camp at the Magdeburg Polte-Werke; his mother, grandmother and sister were murdered by the Nazis in the Rumbula massacre. In 1946 he immigrated to New York and began his career as an artist. For a short time he attended the Art Students' League, where he studied with George Grosz and produced figurative work inspired his wartime memories and of his life in New York, especially the dance halls around 14th Street. One of his best-known and most controversial works is \\"Railroad Collage\\" (1959), a collage juxtaposing a pin-up model undressing over the top of a wagon piled high with bodies of former prisoners in the newly liberated Buchenwald concentration camp.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Photograph Number: 74604 Over the course of his life, he produced thousands of drawings, etchings, paintings, collages, assemblages, and objects, often with pornographic or Holocaust- related imagery, as well as the novel House of AnitaHouse of Anita (2016) (released in a 2016 edition with texts and commentary by Terence Sellers), a large memoir entitled \\"In Riga\\" (published in 2019), and scores of poetry, collected in the volume Geschriebigtes - Gedichtigtes: NO!art in Buchenwald (2003) Geschriebigtes - Gedichtigtes: NO!Art in Buchenwald.

Their art was made out of a sense of disillusionment with the contemporary art scene, especially the emergence of pop. The goal was to have art address disconcerting truths: racism, imperialism, anti-semitism, nuclear holocaust, sexism, the art market, vulgarity, and depravity. Because of the content of Lurie's work, which often features the word \\"NO,\\" and the 1963 NO Show at the Gallery: Gertrude Stein (24 East 81 Street, New York, NY), the group would become known as the NO!art movement. The movement favors \\"totally unabashed self-expression leading to social action\\" and is opposed to the worldwide capitalist \\"investment art market\\", to pop-art that celebrates consumerism and to decorative \\"salon art\\" such as abstract expressionism. Lurie's art and the NO!Art movement were largely ignored by the establishment, by part for Boris Lurie abominated established artists like Andy Warhol, and in 1970 Lurie wrote his critique \\"MOMA as Manipulator.\\" One of the movement's earliest champions was the Italian art dealer, Arturo Schwarz.\\"Look Ma, No ... Sculpture\\", The Realist, November 1964 Pieces by Lurie are now contained in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.) and the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA; NYC). In 2001, the NO!Art movement was subject of a retrospective at the University of Chicago, the University of Nebraska and at the Whitney Museum of American Art (NYC). In 2002, Amikam Goldman completed a documentary on Boris Lurie entitled No!Art Man, which was premiered at the Anthology Film Archives with Mr. Lurie present. Lurie's art has found more resonance in Germany than in the United States. Germany saw two large exhibitions of his work in 1995 and 2004. A documentary, Shoah and Pin-Ups: The NO!-Artist Boris Lurie, was shown on German TV in 2007. On January 7, 2008, Lurie died from kidney failure, days after having suffered a stroke. At age 83, he was the last surviving founder of the NO!Art movement.

They gave the name NO!Art to the movement on the occasion of their show at the Gallery Gertrude Stein. They set themselves against the contemporary trends in Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art in art, and used their work to attack fascism, racism and imperialism in politics. The NO!art exhibitions bore titles such as the Doom Show, the Involvement Show, the No Show and the Vulgar Show.

The post was originally focused on schools: from 1999 to 2000, responsibility for schools rested with the Minister for Children and Education, which became the Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs in the McLeish Government of 2000 to 2001. From 2001 to 2007, the schools portfolio rested with the Minister for Education and Young People. The skills brief also rested with the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning between 1999 and 2007. The Salmond government, elected following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, created the junior post of the Minister for Schools and Skills who assisted the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, in the Scottish Executive Education Department. This was then retitled on 7 December 2011 following the creation of the Minister of Youth Employment post which took over the responsibility for skills and training. A further change occurred in May 2016, following Nicola Sturgeon's reshuffle. The post was rebranded as Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science. The post was vacant for a period over as the summer of 2018, as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's original choice, Gillian Martin, was revealed to have posted comments of a transphobic nature in a blog in 2007. Ms Martin's name was omitted from the list of appointments to be approved by Parliament on 28 June 2018 following a reshuffle. Richard Lochhead was later appointed to the role.

It is associated with Hizen Province in modern-day Saga Prefecture.\\"Hizen Province\\" at JapaneseCastleExplorer.com; retrieved 2013-5-28. In the han system, Hasunoike was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West. History Hasunoike Domain was originally a sub- domain of the Saga Domain, founded for Nabeshima Naozumi, the fifth son of the first daimy≈ç of Saga Domain, Nabeshima Katsushige. Naozumi was assigned holdings of 52,000 koku. The headquarters of the domain were within the san- no-maru (third bailey) of Saga Castle; later a separate structure, a jin'ya in the Hasunoike district of Saga city was erected. Hasunoike initially had sankin-k≈çtai and was treated as if an independent domain. However, in 1730, it petitioned the Tokugawa shogunate to be permitted to stop making the expensive trips to Edo, and was consequently was allowed to attend as part of the retinue of Saga Domain. During the unsettled Bakumatsu period, the 9th (and last) daimy≈ç of Hasunoike, Nabeshima Naotada was he was ordered the Tokugawa shogunate to take responsibility of the defenses of the Nagasaki area against possible incursions by foreign ships, and was forced to raise and train troops, and build coastal defense fortifications in 1854. This greatly strained the already precarious finances of the domain, which could only be resolved by placing the domain into great debt. In 1864, Naotada dispatched troops to Kyoto to assist the Tokugawa forces in keeping public order.

At the time of the photograph, the toll plaza had a 70-cent toll for cars. A barrier toll system (also known as an open toll system) is a method of collecting tolls on highways using toll barriers at regularly spaced intervals on the toll road's mainline. Motorists are typically charged a flat-rate toll, unlike toll roads with a ticket system where the toll rate is determined by the distance traveled or number of exits passed. Some highways use coin-drop machines on toll plazas. For toll roads whose ramps have no toll plazas, it is possible to exit the toll road before the mainline toll plaza, use local streets to bypass it, then re-enter the highway via an interchange on the other side of the toll plaza. Thus it is possible to drive on some barrier toll roads while paying less or not paying at all; this is the basis of the \\"open\\" descriptor. There are two main methods by which planners may prevent such toll evasion. One method is to simply remove highway entrances after and exits before toll plazas, so that detouring around toll plazas becomes such an inconvenience that most users will not bother. Another method is to place toll plazas on exits before and entrances after mainline toll barriers, so that all users will always have to pay at least one toll, regardless of entry or exit point. The second method is sometimes called a \\"barrier-ramp\\" system; it can be deemed open or closed, respectively, depending upon whether it is consistently applied to all entrances and exits, or only some of them. Examples of the second method may be found on the Everett Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, and the Autostrada dei Laghi. The barrier toll system can create more congestion than the ticket system, since it forces all motorists to stop for several toll plazas each time they travel down the highway. Open road tolling can alleviate this issue by allowing most users to proceed through the barrier at full speed.  Highways where used  The following is a list of some toll roads that use the barrier system: * Maine Turnpike * Spaulding Turnpike * Everett Turnpike * Garden State Parkway * Delaware Route 1 * Delaware Turnpike (only one barrier exists for both directions of traffic in Newark) * Atlantic City Expressway * West Virginia Turnpike * Tri-State Tollway * Jane Addams Memorial Tollway  Highways that formerly used the barrier system  * Dallas North Tollway‚Äîentire length (replaced by open road tolling on December 11, 2010) * New England Thruway (replaced by open road tolling on December 19, 2018) * President George Bush Turnpike‚Äîentire length (replaced by open road tolling on July 1, 2009) * Camino Colombia Toll Road--entire length for its duration as a privately owned toll road from the late 1990s until 2004.

Kindermusik is a method of early childhood education and is one of the most widely recognized music and movement programs for young children. History In the 1960s in West Germany, a group of teachers developed a program they called \\"Musikalische Fr√ºherziehung\\" (early musical instruction). The goal of the program was to teach children about music before they were old enough to begin formal music instruction. This program was eventually adapted for use in the United States and was renamed Kindermusik. In the 1980s the Kindermusik program was rolled out to countries around the world. In 2002, the company's employees purchased the company from its 96 investors.Kindermusik Change is Music to Employees' Ears; Company's 55 Workers Buy Business, The News & Record (Piedmont Triad, NC), April 11, 2002 Today, there are over 5,000 licensed Kindermusik instructors teaching classes around the world.Overview presented on Kindermusik website Curriculum Kindermusik offers classes structured around singing, games, movement to music, and listening activities for all age groups (and their parents) between birth and 7 years. The philosophy of Kindermusik education involves parents as the most important teachers and the home environment as the most important place to learn.Robert A. Cutietta, Raising Musical Kids: A Guide for Parents, Oxford University Press, Inc. (New York, NY), 2001, page 31, [cloth] [paperback] The following classes are typically offered: * Village - Village is designed for babies up to 18 months, along with a caregiver. Classes are held once a week for 15 weeks for 45 minutes and provide an opportunity for the baby to learn through music and movement. * Our Time - For children from 18 months to 3 years, Our Time fosters communication, self-confidence, and self-control. For 15 weeks, the child attends the weekly 45 minute class with a caregiver. Children are encouraged to sing, dance, listen and play instruments. * Imagine That - This course is designed for children aged 3 to 5 and encourages socialization, sharing and participation in group activities. Children are often asked to use their imaginations. Once again, this class meets once a week for 15 weeks for 45 minutes, however the caregiver only participates for the last 15 minutes of class. * Young Child - Young Child classes are conducted once a week for 15 weeks and last from 60 to 75 minutes. This class is designed as a precursor to starting formal music lessons. Children learn basic musical symbols and play a variety of instruments (e.g., keyboards, stringed and woodwind instruments). * Music Box - This program is designed for 3 to 5 year olds who attend preschool. Thirty minute classes are offered weekly for 10 weeks. The program is designed to foster self-expression and creativity through age-appropriate music and movement activities. * Summer Camp - A five session Kindermusik summer camp for all children aged newborn to 7 years. Classes are offered for different age ranges. * Sign and Sing - Designed for hearing children aged 6 months to 3 years, Sign and Sing is a five-week course. Classes are held once a week for 40‚Äì50 minutes. Children are introduced to more than 50 signs presented through music and play. * Family Time - This class is designed for families with multiple children. Classes are held once a week for 10 weeks and last 40‚Äì50 minutes. Basic musical concepts are introduced weekly and then structured free time is provided for the whole family to learn together. Winter, spring, and summer sessions are usually offered. A theme is chosen for each session and home materials are provided. Typically, home materials include a music CD, books, an instrument, and a carrying case. Study In 2003, Kindermusik International awarded a grant to two professors in Applied Developmental Psychology at George Mason University (Fairfax, VA). The professors conducted a study titled \\"The Role of Music in the Development of Self-Regulation in Preschool Children.\\" The study concluded that children that were currently enrolled in Kindermusik exhibited more self- control than those not currently enrolled. Musical exposure seemed to increase self-control in the four-year-olds included in the study when compared to those with less music exposure. The study also tested the effect of \\"clean-up\\" music which was played while the children were putting toys away, concluding that the music had no impact on the children's willingness to clean (or lack thereof), but did make things easier for parents.The Role of Music in the Development of Self-Regulation in Preschool Children by Ducenne, Winsler and Koury, George Mason University (Fairfax, VA), 2003-2005 References External links *Kindermusik International's website Category:Music education organizations ","title":"Kindermusik International"},{"id":"12442688","text":"Several high schools are known as Camden High School including: *Camden High School (New Jersey) *Camden High School (Camden, New York) *Camden High School (Camden, South Carolina) *Camden High School (San Jose, California) *Camden High School (New South Wales) (Australia) See also *Camden County High School (disambiguation) ","title":"Camden High School"},{"id":"12442691","text":"The German foundation Berthold Leibinger Stiftung was founded in 1992 by the engineer, entrepreneur and patron Berthold Leibinger in Ditzingen near Stuttgart, Germany.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The church dates mainly from the 14th century. Its features include the Ridley chapel, the alabaster chest tomb of Sir Hugh Calveley and the tomb of Sir George Beeston. Raymond Richards, author of Old Cheshire Churches, considers it is architecturally one of the most important examples of its period in Cheshire. Alec Clifton-Taylor includes it in his list of 'best' English parish churches. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Malpas. Its benefice is combined with that of St Jude, Tilstone Fearnall. History From the 8th century a church has been on the site, initially a wooden Anglo-Saxon church. By 1135 a stone Norman church was present. The church was rebuilt in the decorated style in 1320. In 1385‚Äì86 Sir Hugh Calveley endowed it as a collegiate church, which resulted in more rebuilding: much of the existing structure dates from this time. A chantry chapel was added in 1527 by Sir Rauph Egerton of Ridley. After the dissolution of the chantries and collegiate churches in 1547, Thomas Aldersey acquired the church's tithes and advowson, and he endowed a preacher and a curate in Bunbury. He donated the tithes and advowson to the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, who followed his wishes in appointing Puritan ministers who later included William Hinde. Nave galleries were added in the 18th century. From 1863‚Äì66, restoration work was done by Pennington and Bridgen, when wall paintings, galleries, and box pews were removed, the floor was tiled, and a new roof was constructed. In 1940 a land mine seriously damaged the church. The roof was replaced in 1950 by Marshall Sisson. Architecture Exterior The church, built in red sandstone with a lead and slate roof, is mainly Perpendicular in style. At the west end a tower leads to a broad six-bay nave and narrow eight-bay north and south aisles which enclose the tower. The three-bay chancel is narrower than the nave and leads to a sanctuary with a vestry to the north. To the south of the chancel is the Ridley chapel. A south porch extends from the fifth bay from the west. The tower has a west doorway above which is a three-light window. The ringers' windows are single lancets, and the belfry windows are of four lights. The top of the tower is surmounted by battlements and pinnacles. The parapet of the north aisle consists of stone openwork with crocketed pinnacles; the parapet of the south aisle is crenellated. Interior Fragments of wall paintings remain inside the church. The octagonal stone font is dated 1662 and the oak communion rail dates from 1717. The choir stalls are of carved oak, as is the pulpit, which rests on a stone base. The brass chandelier in Baroque style is dated 1756. The chancel screen is by F. H. Crossley and is dated 1921. The stone screen to the Ridley chapel, a chantry chapel constructed in 1527 on the instructions of Sir Ralph (Raufe) Egerton of Ridley, is \\"the only substantial painted medieval screen to survive in Cheshire\\". Twelve painted figures also survive from a former parclose screen of around 1450, which include Saint Catherine, Saint Apollonia, and Saint Anthony of Egypt; they were restored in 1988 and are currently mounted along the south wall. In several windows there are fragments of original stained glass. Windows by Kempe dated 1905 are in the south chancel wall, and in the north chancel wall are windows dated 1952 by R. C. Evetts. The glass in the east and west windows and in the east window of the north aisle is by Christopher Webb of St Albans. Monuments Tomb of Sir Hugh Calveley Sir Hugh Calveley (d.1394) Sir Hugh Calveley (died 23 April 1394) was an English knight and commander, who took part in the Hundred Years' War, gaining fame during the War of the Breton Succession and the Castilian Civil War. He held various military posts in Brittany and Normandy. He founded the college of which St Boniface was the collegiate church, in the 1380s. His alabaster tomb and effigy is in the centre of the chancel and is enclosed within contemporary ironwork, though there is some doubt as to whether he was in fact buried there. The niches in the sarcophagus originally contained weepers (small figures of mourners). The effigy was likely commissioned by Sir Robert Knolles. Sir George Beeston (d.1601) Tomb of Sir George Beeston In the north wall of the sanctuary is the tomb of Sir George Beeston who was the commander of Dreadnought when it fought against the Spanish Armada. At this time he was reputedly aged 89, and his memorial states he died at the age of 102,'BEESTON, Sir George (c.1520-1601), of Beeston, Cheshire' in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603, ed. P.W. Hasler (London: 1981). According to this biography, documentary evidence states he was only 22 at his father's death in 1542, suggesting age at death of only 80/81. The Latin inscription is as follows, translated into English:Translated from Latin by Rylands and Beazley in The Monuments of Bunbury Church, 1918 > \\"Here lies buried George Beeston, knight, a promoter of valour and truth; > having been brought up from his youth in the arts of war he was chosen one > of his company of pensioners by the invincible King Henry the Eighth, when > he besieged Boulogne [1544]; he merited [the same] under Edward the Sixth in > the battle against the Scots at Musselburgh [1547]. Afterwards under the > same King, under Mary, and under Elizabeth, in the naval engagements as > captain or vice-captain of the fleet, by whom, after that most mighty > Spanish fleet of 1588, had been vanquished, he was honoured with the order > of knighthood; and now, his years pressing heavily on him, when he had > admirably approved his integrity to princes, and his bravery to his > adversaries, acceptable to God, and dear to good men, and long expecting > Christ, in the year 1601 and in the ... of his age, he fell asleep in Him, > so that he may rise again in Him with joy. And together with him rests a > most beloved wife, Alice, daughter of [Thomas] Davenport of Henbury, > esquire, a matron most holy, chaste, and liberal to the poor, who, when she > had lived in matrimony 66 years, and had borne to her husband three sons, > John, Hugh, and Hugh, and as many daughters, Ann, Jane, and Dorothy, passed > into the heavenly country in the year 1591 and in the [refer below] year of > her age, with Christ for ever to live. The dutifulness of their son Hugh > Beeston, esquire, the younger, Receiver General of all the revenues of the > Crown as well as in the county palatine of Chester as in the counties of > North Wales, set up this monument to parents most excellent and beloved.\\" His daughter Dorothy (d.29 July 1601) became the wife of John Copleston Esq. (d.1606), of Eggesford, Devon, and their sole daughter Anne Copleston (1588‚Äì1616) married Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester (1568‚Äì1648) Governor of Carrickfergus and Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh, in Ireland.Memorial tablet in Eggesford Church erected in 1614 Under the semi- circular tomb arch and above Sir George Beeston's effigy in armour a further inscription, when translated, reads: > \\"Hugh Beeston, knight, son of George Beeston, knight, mindful of mortality, > and in certain hope of rising again in Christ, placed this monument to his > parents, himself, and George Beeston an only son, of the same knightly > order, a youth, alas! snatched away by a too early death. Hugh, the father, > died in the year of our salvation, 1627, but George, the son, 1611.\\" Other features In the south wall of the sanctuary are a triple sedilia and a double-draining piscina. In the south aisle are 15th century painted wooden panels which were formerly part of parclose screens; they were restored at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1988. In the north aisle is a standing effigy of Jane Johnson, who died in 1741. Around 1760, it was removed to the churchyard and buried on the instruction of the incumbent. It was rediscovered in the 19th century and was restored to the interior of the church. Also in the church are three memorial boards which are believed to have been painted by members of the Randle Holme family of Chester. At the back of the church in the northeast corner are a number of stone coffin lids, and defaced effigies dating from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The organ was built in 1895 by P. Conacher of Huddersfield. It was extensively rebuilt in 1968 by Henry Willis & Sons. The tower contains a ring of eight bells. The oldest two of these date from around 1500 and around 1610. Two later bells were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1715 and 1758. The remaining bells were cast in the Whitechapel Bell Foundry by Thomas Mears II in 1817, and by Mears and Stainbank, two in 1895 and one in 1898. The parish registers begin in 1559 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1655. Carved stones dating from the Norman period have been discovered beneath the floor of the church and these are stored in the south porch. External features The west gates The north gates to the church yard are listed at Grade II, as are the west gates which were reconstructed as memorial gates around 1919. In the church yard are two other structures listed at Grade II, a red sandstone sundial dated 1710, and a gravestone consisting of two sandstone slabs probably dating from the early 16th century.

It is an old routing of US-6 and US-50. The entire route is co-signed with U.S. Route 6 Business. Route description From its western terminus at the offramp of US-6/US-191, the highway goes east on 100 North. At its junction 300 East, it turns south briefly before returning east on Main Street. It continues on Main Street, which veers to the south until meeting again with another grade-separated intersection. The route is listed as part of the National Highway System. History Looking eastbound on SR-55 in Price toward SR-10 The route through downtown Price had been designated SR-8 early in the state highway system's history; it would also become US-50 in 1926 and US-6 in 1937. The underlying state route designation was changed to SR-27 in 1969, but otherwise the routes did not change. However, by the 1970s, a new super-two bypass of the city center was being built for long- distance through traffic. As a result, the U.S. routes were moved onto this bypass, and the modern iteration of SR-55 was created in 1975 on the old routing of US 6/50. Since then, the route has not been changed.

Due to the rapid increase in the population of the school, the school had to expand and relocate to Haddon and Newton Avenues. On May 9, 1969, a group of 100 white residents marched to the home of Camden Mayor Alfred R. Pierce to insist that white students receive protection from the black students that were the majority at Camden High School. Black students were fighting for administrative and curriculum changes, wanted more courses on African American culture and history in school and sought the appointment of an African American principal and athletic coaches. The Mayor planned to call in the police to deal with the situation at the school but he did not let the parents know. The white parents were not going to send their children back to school until the situation was resolved. Charles V.

Demolition  Construction Work on Camden High School after the demolition In 2008, Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie announced plans to renovate Camden High School. He approved a budget of $100 million for renovation until in 2011 when he decided that it was not be the best way to solve the problems of the school. This ultimately led to the decision to demolish and rebuild the high school because it was much more economical to rebuild a new school than to renovate the old school. The school was demolished after the end of the 2016/2017 school year. On November 27, 2017, the attempt to demolish Camden High School by the school's parent association was denied by Judge Nan S. Famular . It was denied because the superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard and the city school board as defendants said that it was a violation of New Jersey Register of Historic Places Act to destroy the high school. Mo'Neke Ragsdale, a member of the Camden High PTA, believed that putting resources towards saving the school was not worth the effort but still wanted to save the school. The final decision was ruled by a state Superior Court Judge allowing the demolition of the high school. The parts of the school that were to be demolished were the ones that were built before 1917. They would be replaced with a $133 million budget for academic buildings that would be considered state-of-the-art. Alumni of Camden High School and the group \\"Stop the Demolition of Camden High\\", led by Mo'Neke Ragsdale, fought to preserve the old Camden High School. They sought to add Camden High School to the list of National Register of Historic Places. They wanted the construction to be on the back of the school because they had over 18 acres of land. The students will use the Cooper B. Hatch Middle school for their classes while construction continues in their school. As of 2019, the construction of the new Camden High School is expected to be finished by 2021.

Traditional pessimistic replication systems try to guarantee from the beginning that all of the replicas are identical to each other, as if there was only a single copy of the data all along. Optimistic replication does away with this in favor of eventual consistency, meaning that replicas are guaranteed to converge only when the system has been quiesced for a period of time. As a result, there is no longer a need to wait for all of the copies to be synchronized when updating data, which helps concurrency and parallelism. The trade-off is that different replicas may require explicit reconciliation later on, which might then prove difficult or even insoluble. Algorithms An optimistic replication algorithm consists of five elements: # Operation submission: Users submit operations at independent sites. # Propagation: Each site shares the operations it knows about with the rest of the system. # Scheduling: Each site decides on an order for the operations it knows about. # Conflict resolution: If there are any conflicts among the operations a site has scheduled, it must modify them in some way. # Commitment: The sites agree on a final schedule and conflict resolution result, and the operations are made permanent. There are two strategies for propagation: state transfer, where sites propagate a representation of the current state, and operation transfer, where sites propagate the operations that were performed (essentially, a list of instructions on how to reach the new state). Scheduling and conflict resolution can either be syntactic or semantic. Syntactic systems rely on general information, such as when or where an operation was submitted. Semantic systems are able to make use of application-specific information to make smarter decisions. Note that state transfer systems generally have no information about the semantics of the data being transferred, and so they have to use syntactic scheduling and conflict resolution. Examples One well-known example of a system based on optimistic replication is the CVS version control system, or any other version control system which uses the copy-modify-merge paradigm. CVS covers each of the five elements: # Operation submission: Users edit local versions of files. # Propagation: Users manually pull updates from a central server, or push changes out once the user feels they are ready. # Scheduling: Operations are scheduled in the order that they are received by the central server. # Conflict resolution: When a user pushes to or pulls from the central repository, any conflicts will be flagged for that user to fix manually. # Commitment: Once the central server accepts the changes which a user pushes, they are permanently committed. A special case of replication is synchronization, where there are only two replicas. For example, personal digital assistants (PDAs) allow users to edit data either on the PDA or a computer, and then to merge these two datasets together. Note, however, that replication is a broader problem than synchronization, since there may be more than two replicas. Other examples include: * Usenet, and other systems which use the Thomas Write Rule (See Rfc677) * Multi-master database replication * The Coda distributed filesystem * Operational Transformation, a theoretical framework for group editing * Peer-to-peer wikis * Conflict-free replicated data types * The Bayou distributed database * IceCube Implications Applications built on top of optimistic replicated databases need to be careful about ensuring that the delayed updates observed do not impair the correctness of the application. As a simple example, if an application contains a way of viewing some part of the database state, and a way of editing it, then users may edit that state but then not see it changing in the viewer. Alarmed that their edit \\"didn't work\\", they may try it again, potentially more than once. If the updates are not idempotent (e.g., they increment a value), this can lead to disaster. Even if they are idempotent, the spurious database updates can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when the database systems are processing heavy loads; this can become a vicious circle. Testing of applications is often done on a testing environment, smaller in size (perhaps only a single server) and less loaded than the \\"live\\" environment. The replication behaviour of such an installation may differ from a live environment in ways that mean that replication lag is unlikely to be observed in testing, masking replication-sensitive bugs. Application developers must be very careful about the assumptions they make about the effect of a database update, and must be sure to simulate lag in their testing environments. Optimistically replicated databases have to be very careful about offering features such as validity constraints on data. If any given update may or may not be accepted based on the current state of the record, then two updates (A and B) may be individually legal against the starting state of the system, but one or more of the updates may not be legal against the state of the system after the other update (e.g., A and B are both legal, but AB or BA are illegal). If A and B are both initiated at roughly the same time within the database, then A may be successfully applied on some nodes and B on others, but as soon as A and B \\"meet\\" and one is attempted on a node which has already applied the other, a conflict will be found. The system must, in this case, decide which update finally \\"wins\\", and arrange for any nodes that have already applied the losing update to revert it. However, some nodes may temporarily expose the state with the reverted update, and there may be no way to inform the user who initiated the update of its failure, without requiring them to wait (potentially forever) for confirmation of acceptance at every node.

It is an occupational lung disease and a type of work-related asthma. Agents that can induce occupational asthma can be grouped into sensitizers and irritants. Sensitizer-induced occupational asthma is an immunologic form of asthma which occurs due to inhalation of specific substances (i.e., high-molecular-weight proteins from plants and animal origins, or low-molecular-weight agents that include chemicals, metals and wood dusts) and occurs after a latency period of several weeks to years. Irritant-induced (occupational) asthma is a non- immunologic form of asthma that results from a single or multiple high dose exposure to irritant products. It is usually develops early after exposure; however can also develop insidiously over a few months after a massive exposure to a complex mixture of alkaline dust and combustion products, as shown in the World Trade Center disaster. Unlike those with sensitizer-induced occupational asthma, subjects with irritant-induced occupational asthma do not develop work-related asthma symptoms after re-exposure to low concentrations of the irritant that initiated the symptoms. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is an severe form of irritant induced asthma where respiratory symptoms usually develop in the minutes or hours after a single accidental inhalation of a high concentration of irritant gas, aerosol, vapor, or smoke. Another type of work-related asthma is work-exacerbated asthma (WEA) which is asthma worsened by workplace conditions but not caused by it. WEA is present in about a fifth of patients with asthma and a wide variety of conditions at work, including irritant chemicals, dusts, second-hand smoke, common allergens that may be present at work, as well as other ‚Äúexposures‚Äù such as emotional stress, worksite temperature, and physical exertion can exacerbate asthma symptoms in these patients. Both occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma can be present in an individual. A number of diseases have symptoms that mimic occupational asthma, such as asthma due to nonoccupational causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritable larynx syndrome, hyperventilation syndrome, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Signs and symptoms  Like other types of asthma, it is characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airways obstruction, and bronchospasm, but it is caused by something in the workplace environment. Symptoms include shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, coughing, sputum production and wheezing. Some patients may also develop upper airway symptoms such as itchy eyes, tearing, sneezing, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Symptoms may develop over many years as in sensitizer induced asthma or may occur after a single exposure to a high-concentration agent as in case of RADS.  Risk factors At present, over 400 workplace substances have been identified as having asthmagenic or allergenic properties.(T78) Occupational Asthma : Table of agents, products and substances which can cause asthma Agents such as flour, diisocyanates, latex, persulfate salts, aldehydes, animals, wood dusts, metals, enzymes usually account for the majority cases, however, the distribution of causal agents may vary widely across geographic areas, depending on the pattern of industrial activities. For example, in France the industries most affected are bakeries and cake-shops, automobile industry and hairdressers, whereas in Canada the principal cause is wood dust, followed by isocyanates. Furthermore, the most common cause of occupational asthma in the workplace are isocyanates. Isocyanates are used in the production of motor vehicles and in the application of orthopaedic polyurethane and fibreglass casts. The occupations most at risk are: adhesive handlers (e.g. acrylate), animal handlers and veterinarians (animal proteins), bakers and millers (cereal grains), carpet makers (gums), electronics workers (soldering resin), forest workers, carpenters and cabinetmakers (wood dust), hairdressers (e.g. persulfate), health care workers (latex and chemicals such as glutaraldehyde), janitors and cleaning staff (e.g. chloramine-T), pharmaceutical workers (drugs, enzymes), seafood processors, shellac handlers (e.g. amines), solderers and refiners (metals), spray painters, insulation installers, plastics and foam industry workers (e.g. diisocyanates), textile workers (dyes) and users of plastics and epoxy resins (e.g. anhydrides) The following tables show occupations that are known to be at risk for occupational asthma, the main reference for these is the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety. {  -

Various diagnostic tests can be used to aid in diagnoses of work related asthma. A spirometer is a device used to measure timed expired and inspired volumes, and can be used to help diagnose asthma. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is a hand held device which measures how fast a person can exhale and is a reliable test for occupational asthma. Serial PEFR can be measured to see if there is a difference in ability to exhale at work compared to that in a controlled environment. A non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity test can be used to support the diagnose occupational asthma. It involves measuring the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV-1) of the patient before and after exposure to methacholine or mannitol. Presence of airway responsiveness i.e. significant drop in FEV-1 can be seen in patients with occupational asthma. Specific inhalation challenges test consist of exposing the subjects to the suspected occupational agent in the laboratory and/or at the workplace and assess for asthma symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV1. Other tests such as skin prick test, serum immunologic testing and measurement of sputum eosinophils can also be useful in establishing the diagnosis of occupational asthma.  Prevention  Several forms of preventive measures have been suggested to prevent development of occupational asthma and also detect risk or disease early to allow intervention and improve outcomes. These include: comprehensive programs, education and training, medical examinations, use of medications, reduction of exposures and elimination of exposures.A video on research on preventing asthma in health careAsthma symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness can persist for several years after removal from the offending environment. Thus, early restriction from exposure to the trigger is advisable. Completely stopping exposure is more effective treatment than reducing exposure, but not always feasible. Management Medication Medications used for occupational asthma are similar to those used for other types of asthma such as short-acting beta-agonists like salbutamol or terbutaline, long-acting beta-agonists like salmeterol and formoterol and inhaled corticosteroids. Immunotherapy can also be used in some cases of sensitizer induced occupational asthma.  Epidemiology  Occupational asthma is one of the most common occupational lung disease. Approximately 17% of all adult-onset asthma cases are related to occupational exposures. About one fourth of adults with asthma have work-exacerbated asthma. Patients with work-related asthma are more likely to experience asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and worsening of their asthma symptoms compared with other adult asthma patients. Society and culture  Compensation  When a person is diagnosed with occupational asthma, it can result in serious socio-economic consequences not only for the workers but also for the employer and the healthcare system because the worker must change positions. The probability of being re-employed is lower for those with occupational asthma compared to those with normal asthma. The employer not only pays compensation to the employee, but will also have to spend a considerable amount of time and energy and funds for hiring and training new personnel. In the United States, it was estimated that the direct cost of occupational asthma in 1996 was $1.2 billion and the indirect cost $0.4 billion, for a total cost of $1.6 billion. However, this can entail severe socio-economic consequences for the worker as well as the employer due to loss of job, unemployment, compensation issues, medical expenditures, and hiring and re-training of new personnel.

History Kenner's international fame was primarily as the lead vocalist for The James Gang from 1972 until 1974. He joined the group after the departure of Joe Walsh and was with the band with guitarist Domenic Troiano and later Tommy Bolin. He was also with Domenic Troiano in the Canadian bands Mandala and Bush, both of which had some degree of international success, and sang on Troiano's solo albums.Jeremy Frey, [ Profile of Roy Kenner]; AllMusic. In the 1970s, Kenner was instrumental in launching the career of Lisa Dal Bello. Her first single, \\"(I Don't Want To) Stand in Your Way,\\" was written by Kenner, and is regarded as one of the strongest songs on her self-titled 1977 debut album. Following his time with The James Gang, Kenner worked with a Toronto-based television musical variety show, Music Machine, for approximately two years, after which he worked with Garry Peterson (drummer for The Guess Who) in an unrecorded R&B; band, Delphia. In 1975, Kenner joined the U.S. band, Law,Not to be confused with the later Paul Rodgers ‚Äì Kenney Jones band of the same name. and recorded two albums with them, on the Goldhawke RecordsGoldhawke record label, owned by Roger Daltrey. Kenner then rejoined Domenic Troiano, co- writing and singing on Troiano's 1979 album, Fret Fever. The record included the dance hit \\"We All Need Love,\\" Troiano's biggest commercial success. The two also collaborated on TV soundtracks, in particular the theme to the TV series \\"Night Heat\\". Despite his international success as a lead vocalist, Kenner has never released a solo album. In 1982, he contributed to one half of a six-song EP, Roy Kenner/The Royals, with three songs co-written with and produced by Domenic Troiano.The other songs on the EP featured George Olliver and Bobby Dupont, two well-known Toronto-based rhythm and blues artists. Nearly fifteen years earlier, Kenner had succeeded Olliver as the lead singer of Mandala, resulting in Kenner, rather than Olliver, contributing the vocals to Mandala's 1968 Soul Crusade album. Kenner currently does jingles and voice- over work in Toronto, in addition to performing occasionally. He has performed at the 2006 and 2007 \\"We All Need Love\\" tribute concerts for Domenic Troiano, who succumbed to cancer in 2005.

Also see Auschwitz Protocols. Auschwitz Report (2006) is a non-fiction report on the Auschwitz extermination camp by Primo Levi and Leonardo de Benedetti. When Levi and de Benedetti were in a Soviet holding camp in Katowice in 1945 the Soviet authorities asked them to document the living conditions in Auschwitz. De Benedetti had been on Levi's transport from Fossoli, near Modena, Italy. Both had been left behind when the camp was evacuated and so their time at Auschwitz coincided exactly. De Benedetti was a medical doctor, though he acted as one only in the final weeks of his time at the camp. His survival was extremely unusual, since he was in his 40s when he arrived: normally, those over the age of 30 were sent directly to the gas chambers on arrival. Much of the report describes the facilities for treating the sick. Treatments were rudimentary, medicines were in short supply and the skill of the nurses was minimal. Normal practices of hygiene were ignored. Cross-contamination and infection were widespread. The hospital was set up only a few months before Levi's arrival. There had previously been no medical treatment at all. Sick inmates worked until they collapsed, at which point they were beaten: if they moved, they were sent back to work, and if not, they were sent to the gas chambers.

Considered a kwaito artist, his debut album, Shimaliw' Osatana, was released in 2004 to mixed reviews. The Dogg was part of the group Omalaeti O'Swapo, which released one album in 2004. His music is enjoyed internationally, in countries such as South Africa, Botswana, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Dogg has performed in France, England and Canada. He has received awards and nominations from Channel O. He is one of the highest awarded artist in his country, as well as one of the highest selling. The Dogg is the owner of the Mshasho Productions record label and the associated Mshasho Clothing.  Early life  The Dogg began his formal education at Onayena Primary School situated in Onayena, a village in east Ondangwa, where he has been living since returning from exile in Zambia, in 1989. Morocky is the youngest child of four siblings. His aspiration as a child was to become a mechanical engineer while music remained a dormant passion. In 1997, he moved to Windhoek City to attend his secondary education at Augustineum Secondary School in Khomasdal. After graduating from high school, Morocky chose to study for a Science degree at the University of Namibia. He left the university after one academic year to pursue a career in music.  Musical career   Rise to fame  The Dogg used to perform at school concerts in his high-school years. When he was in grade nine, he and long-time friend Joe Basson, now known as Auntie Sousa, created a kwaito dancing group called Amasilkies. Before pursuing a career in music, he was a backup artist, a dancer and he also opened shows for his famous cousin Killa B and well-known friend Jossy Joss. Morocky also opened concerts for well known South African artists, including Mzekezeke, Malaika, Mafikizolo, Mandoza, Brown Dash, Brickz and Ishmael among others. He rose to fame following the release of his hit single \\"Jesus Otati\\", a kwaito-gospel song produced by Elvo in 2003. \\"Jesus Otati\\" (meaning \\"Jesus is saying\\") opened doors for Morocky's career. The song was very popular and earned him comparison to South African kwaito star Mandoza due to the roughness in his voice, which was compared to that of Mandoza. His voice was also compared to American rapper DMX, who is also known as The Dog, from which Morocky possibly got his stage name. The success of \\"Jesus Otati\\" propelled The Dogg to win the award for Artist of the Year and Best Kwaito song at the 2003 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. He then in 2003 founded Mshasho Productions, which gained popularity in 2004 after his second album. Early career  While struggling to compile his album, The Dogg met and befriended upcoming artist Gazza, who had just returned to Namibia from studies in South Africa. The two started recording together and with the help of Elvo they recorded \\"Ghetto Life\\", a song by Gazza. This song's credits would later bring tension between the two artists. The two later signed solo recording contracts with a kwaito label, RC-Ghetto Records. The Dogg immediately started working on his debut album, releasing the critical acclaimed hit \\"Perfecto Tromentos\\" later that year. Around the same time, The Dogg was featured by Gazza on his hit \\"Shidolodolo\\", which went on to be very popular and won an award for Best Collaboration at the 2004 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. Morocky's released his debut album Shimaliw' Osatana in February 2004 under RC-Ghetto. It became the first full-length kwaito album in his country and won the award for Best Selling album at the 2004 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The album was primarily produced by Elvo, who by then became The Dogg and Gazza's mentor. Later that year in December, Morocky released his second studio album, Take Out Yo Gun. The album was released on his label Mshasho Productions. The lead single from the album, \\"The Dogg Is Back\\", won awards for Best Kwaito song and Best Video at the 2005 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. Morocky would later win the Artist of the Year award for the third time in three years at the 2005 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The Artist of the Year award raised eyebrows by other artist, who started discriminating against Sanlam- NBC's awarding system. This situation would later bring bad blood between The Dogg and music partner Gazza, whom critics claimed was robbed the award. Morocky signed the first artist to his Mshasho label, Sunny Boy, whom he met while studying at University of Namibia. It later turned out that Sunny refused a recording offer from Gazza before signing with The Dogg. At a concert in Luderitz (2005) The Dogg and Gazza got involved in a rooted argument which would later turn sour, prohibiting the two to work together in future. The argument was driven by Sunny Boy's decision to sign with Mshasho, which Gazza claimed was a betrayal as he had plans for signing him to his Gazza Music Productions. After the news hit the media, fans started taking sides. A lot of other issues surfaced, including an argument surrounding the Sanlam-NBC Artist of Year award, which was unfairly awarded to The Dogg. In May 2006 Morocky released his third album, Introducing TeeDee. The Dogg co- produced the entire album with Jay Malgas. On the album The Dogg also introduced his label's artist (OmPuff, Sunny Boy, Tre and Nasti) who all appear on the album. The first single, \\"Baby Don't Go\\", won two awards at the 2006 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards, for Best Collaboration and Best Afro-pop. It also won two awards at the 2006 Namibian Music Awards for Best Collaboration and Best Single. The Dogg also won the award for Best Hip Hop Song in 2006 at the Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. In 2007 it was nominated and won the award for Best Newcomer at the Channel-O Spirit of Africa Video Awards. You Can't Ignore In 2007 The Dogg continue to enjoy success with his music career, he performed in Europe in the beginning of the year and had various tours around Namibia with his Mshasho crew. Despite the success of his last album Introducing TeeDee, he was highly criticized of selling out. He prove critics wrong with the released of You Can't Ignore, which was considered a comeback classic and was compared to his first and second album for its hardcore beats and dark lyrics. The album was well received, denying Gazza's 2007 double album 467/GMP Till I Die airplay at the time of its release. The entire album was self-produced under the mentor guidance of Elvo, with only two songs produced by DJ Kboz. The first single from the album, \\"Can You Feel It\\", was produced by DJ Kboz. It features Mshasho artist Tre Van Die Kasie. The song became a popular hit across Namibia's borders, winning an award at the 2008 Channeol O Music Video Awards for the category Best Kwatito Video. It also won Song of the Year and Best Single at the 2007 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The album became very successful, winning The Dogg his fourth award for Artist of the Year at the same ceremony in 2007. The Dogg has won this award four times in five years. Another popular song was \\"Get Sum More\\", produced by DJ Kboz, and featuring most anticipated rapper at the time Qonja. The song was a very popular club hit. It won an award for Best Collaboration 2008 Namibian Music Awards. Another popular song \\"My Girl\\" also won Best Single at the same awards. The success of the album made it possible for The Dogg to win the People's Choice Award at the same awards. The video for \\"Hands Up\\" was nominated by Channeol O Music Video Awards in 2009 in the category Best Kwaito Video and lost to Gazza's \\"Passop\\". The Dogg also approached Gazza on \\"He He He\\" and Jericho on \\"Hands Up\\".  2009 and beyond  The Dogg's fifth studio album, This Is My Time, was released on 3 April 2009. The Dogg produced the entire album himself with guidance from Elvo. In March 2009, The Dogg was nominated for \\"African Artist of the Year\\" by Nigeria's Hip-Hop World Awards. The award ceremony which was secretly held and never revealed who the winner was and denied nominating the rapper. The organizers made a controversial comment about who he was and from which country he was from. When asked about the issue, Dogg said it was funny to nominate a musician you do not know. The Dogg was chosen to be the first celebrity guest in the Big Brother Africa 4 house. He entered the house on Friday 16 (week 6 of the show) and left on Sunday 18. He also appeared the eviction show, performing \\"Forget\\" with Namibian singer Ricardo. The Dogg released his sixth studio album, The Power of 7 ‚Äì Elevating Elevators, on 30 April 2010. The album was criticized for its poor track listing and the ever-repeating sole production of The Dogg, which makes the album sound similar to its predecessors. In November of that year he announced that he was busy working on an album with rapper Qonja. The two rappers collaborated on a short album entitled Lets Celebrate, released on 16 December 2010 on Mshasho Records. Produced by The Dogg and Elvo, the album features the hits \\"Let's Celebrate\\" with TeQuila, \\"Be My Shepherd\\" with KK and Lil' D, and \\"Merry Christmas\\". Mshasho released The Dogg's seventh studio album, The Deception, on 2 July. It was entirely produced by The Dogg and features big-name artists. It features South African kwaito star Brickz on the song \\"Tromentos\\" and Zambian singer JK on the song \\"End of Time\\", and both songs feature Sunny Boy. Mshasho artist OmPuff also appeared on \\"End of Time\\". The Dogg announced via his Facebook fan page that The Deception would shortly be followed by a part two album, also announcing the title of the upcoming album although not stating when it would be released: \\"MY NEW SINGLE FROM DDECEPTION PART 2 WILL MUTE AFRICA ....PAKAMISH\\".  Producer role  Besides being a musician The Dogg is also an active music producer. He has produced hits for several famous Namibian artists. He started producing music in 2005 under the guidance of his mentor Elvo. He has so far shared production credits with Elvo, DJ Kboz and Christian Poloni. He has produced and served as executive producer on all albums released under Mshasho Records. Additionally he has produced hits for non-Mshasho artists, including Sunny Boy, Qonja, Kamasutra, Faizel MC and Kavax. The Dogg served as the main producer on all of his solo albums since the 2006 release Introducing TeeDee. \\"I've tried a few different things, like mixing some house and rave beats with traditional kwaito beats. I'm working on establishing my own unique blend of music,\\" says The Dogg in an interview with Mtc.com, in October 2007. Through his production career he has collaborated with Elvo and DJ Kboz, the only two producers to have shared production credit with The Dogg.

It is a communally nesting resident bird of arid scrub in the Middle East which lives together in relatively stable groups with strict orders of rank. Taxonomy The Arabian babbler was formerly placed in the genus Turdoides but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus Argya. The Leiothrichidae primarily occur in the Ethiopian and Oriental realms, but a few species in the genera Turdoides and Argya have penetrated into the Palearctic zone north of the tropics where they live in arid areas of North and East Africa, India and the Middle East. Description It is long with a wingspan of and a weight of . It has a fairly long curved bill, a long tail, rounded wings and strong legs and feet. The plumage is grey-brown above, paler below. There are dark streaks on the back and the throat is whitish. It has a variety of calls including whistles, trills and chattering. Distribution and habitat The Arabian babbler prefers to settle along dry river beds with few trees and bushes. It is found in eastern, southern and western Arabia, occurring in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen and western Saudi Arabia but absent from the central and north-eastern parts of the peninsula. Its range extends north to Jordan, Israel and eastern Sinai. It inhabits arid scrubland and savanna, occurring up to 2800 metres above sea- level in Yemen. Behaviour Photographed et al. Ain, Abu Dhabi, UAE Babblers dance and take baths together, offer each other gifts, clean themselves, and sometimes enter into conflict with each other for the privilege of helping another babbler. They may also feed their counterparts. This peculiar behaviour made them a privileged example for ethological theories concerning altruism among animals. Starting in the 1970s, Amotz Zahavi observed the babbler at length, giving rise to his theory of signal and its correlative, the handicap principle. Although babblers were considered particularly altruistic animals, Zahavi reinterpreted their behaviours according to his theory. Thus, Zahavi (1974) theorized that chick feeding by Arabian babbler helpers acts as a signal by the helper to gain social prestige within the group. Group structure and breeding biology Arabian babblers are cooperative breeders that live in groups and defend territories year round. Group size varies from two to 10 individuals. Their territories vary with the group size as well the presence of neighboring groups. Groups consist of a reproductive pair and other non-breeding members who may or may not be direct offspring or close relatives. Helpers usually do not reproduce, but they participate in rearing the offspring, that is, in providing food, as well as other parental behavior like incubation, territory defense and defense against predators. Groups are labelled according to the relatedness of helpers to the reproductive pair: #Simple group: where all helpers are direct offspring of the breeding pairs. #Polyandrous group: where helpers include potential male breeder #Polygynous group: where helpers include potential female breeders #Complex group: Have non-related helpers of both sexes. Nest Babblers build open cup-shaped nests in the dense part of the tree or bush. Their breeding period starts generally from February and varies up to July and is highly dependent on the seasonal rainfall of the region which in turn regulates the food availability. They copulate throughout the year. Eggs are laid usually from February to July. Most clutches contain four eggs, laid on consecutive days. Incubation usually starts after laying the last egg and continues for 14 days until the chicks hatch. The nestlings fledge about 14 days after hatching. Diet The diet of the babblers includes a variety of invertebrates (mostly arthropods), small vertebrates (lizards, geckos, snakes) and plant material, like nectar, flowers, berries, leaves and seeds.

Under the ownership of Greek millionaire Giannis Goulandris, production was moved to the Greek isle of Syros during the oil crisis of 1973, although the vehicles were, according to one report, sent back to be assembled on the Isle of Wight. (actually the cars were completely built on Syros and sent to Britain for installation of the batteries) . Models Enfield 465 Enfield 465 publicity photo The Enfield 465 was a small 2+2-seater electric car built only in prototype form in 1969. It was equipped with a 48 V, electric motor and had an ICI royal plastic body with no metal chassis. It is believed that only three were Built but only two remain as one failed the crash testing. The rear axle came from a Bond Bug with the Motor parrell to it. Enfield 8000 The Chairman of the Electricity Council and other EC Board members on the date of signing the contract for the Enfield 8000 The Enfield 8000 (also known the E8000 ECC or \\"Electric City Car\\") was similar to the 465, but with an motor and aluminium body. 120 Enfield 8000s were built on Syros in the mid-1970s, of which 65 were used by the Electricity Council and southern English electricity boards. The E8000ECC had passed all the necessary tests for production in the United Kingdom and was on its way to be produced in the United States of America. Then Governor of California Ronald Reagan sent a cargo plane to have three E8000ECCs moved to California in support of his Clean Air legislation. However, the E8000ECC was never produced in the United States. The unique aerodynamics of the E8000ECC were not based on traditional industry principles and ideas. They were based on designs made by Konstantine Adraktas, the Chairman and Managing Technical Director of Enfield. The car was eventually produced in Greece after the company was incorporated into Neorion (also owned by Mr. Goulandris) and renamed Enfield-Neorion. Key Characteristics *It had an aluminum body to guard against corrosion. *It was available in a \\"Bicini\\" version which had a body composed of simple flat panels and was never crash tested. *A leather interior was available. *Early models no gear lever, reverse was entered with the use of switch. *It was based on widely available components and parts for easy maintenance and worldwide replacement part availability. *It had an on-board charger (which recharged batteries fully while freewheeling downhill in the Alps.)

The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by urban planners in the United States. In Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an Official Community Plan or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.  History  During the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the American Revolution, the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city. Cities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the Sanitary Reform Movement. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. Frederick Law Olmsted was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The City Beautiful movement was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities. In 1898, Ebenezer Howard published his book entitled \\"Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform,\\" in which he developed the idea of a Garden City. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a green belt and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, Letchworth and Welwyn, England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth. After the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was Daniel Hudson Burnham who re- created the city plan for Washington, D.C. created by Pierre Charles L'Enfant in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. Over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of Cleveland, Ohio and in 1906 he created the city plan for San Francisco, California. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. The plan of Chicago is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.  Comprehensive planning process  Comprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs and wants. Identifying issues The planner must first address the issue they are investigating. \\"To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future.\\"Anderson, Larz. (1995) Guidelines for Preparing Urban Plans Chicago: APA Planners Press. Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens. Stating goals Once issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community. Collecting data Data is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the United States Census Bureau, however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs. Preparing the plan The plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format. ‚Üî Creating implementation plans During this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives. Evaluating alternatives Each alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals. Adopting a plan The community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The City Council may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development. Implementing and monitoring the plan Using the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired. A comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.  Legal basis  The basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens. The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act which was written by the United States Department of Commerce in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the United States Congress but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used. In states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In Georgia, for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily. However, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding. A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.

He is the author of many creative essays such as Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? (2002), How to Talk about Books You Haven't Read (2007), and Sherlock Holmes Was Wrong (2008).  Creations  Pierre Bayard is the founder of \\"interventionist criticism\\", he is opposed to neutral and uncommitted criticism of literary works. In the course of his essays, he has, among other things, chased down unpunished literary criminals (due to the negligence of their creators), provided tips and tricks for talking about books and places that have not been read or seen, or reflected on the resistance/collaboration dilemma. Bayard's most popular book Comment parler des livres que l'on n'a pas lus (Minuit, 2007) (How to talk about books you haven't read) is a bestseller in France in which he engages in a study of the different ways of not reading a book, and recommends solutions to be able to talk about it anyway. Assuming that some readers have a terrifying understanding of reading, he tries to make them feel free from guilt for not having read canonical literature. The essential thing in culture being to have an overview, he claims the possibility of having a perforated and incomplete culture. Pierre Bayard has renewed this system in Comment parler des lieux o√π l'on n'a pas √©t√©, a work in the second degree again, in which he reviews the authors who have spoken of places they have not visited. His books have been considered as cases of \\"novelistic criticism,\\" in that they present revisionist readings of famous fictional mysteries. In his 2008 book L'Affaire du Chien des Baskerville, for example, published in English as Sherlock Holmes was Wrong: Re-opening the Case of the Hound of the Baskervilles he analyzes the famous Sherlock Holmes case, and in his earlier book Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? he re-investigates Agatha Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. His book on Hamlet argues that Claudius did not kill Hamlet's father,... In these essays on Agatha Christie, Shakespeare and Conan Doyle, he engages in real literary counter-investigations, studying the motivations of the characters, highlighting the inconsistencies of the intrigues and humorously showing that fictional characters escape their creators. Moreover, humour is a fundamental element of his writing. In How to talk about books you haven't read, the narrator teaches the way not to read, which is a joke because he himself is a great reader. For Pierre Bayard, humour has an analytical function. It allows you to mark a gap between yourself and yourself, and therefore to distance yourself from what you read. In his latest book, La v√©rit√© sur \\"Dix Petits n√®gres\\" (Minuit, 2019) Pierre Bayard totally questions the solution delivered by Agatha Christie to the outcome of his novel. His entire book is therefore the counter-investigation that must restore the truth: we find in fact the procedure he already used in Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? and in Sherlock Holmes was wrong: attempts to rectify certain fictional police investigations that he considers unlikely. And he proposes to come back to a new literary misunderstanding and shed light on a mystery that no one has solved, not even Agatha Christie. The novelty this time being that he lets the real murderer of the And Then There Were None speak for himself to lead us to the only acceptable solution.

It includes three species. Taxonomy B. insignis was first described for an unusual akysid by Franz Steindachner in 1881. The genus had been monotypic since its description until a revision in 1998, along with the description of the two species B. cessator and B. hypselurus. This genus stands out as derived among the akysids due to the large increase in vertebrae count. B. insignis and B. cessator are more closely related to one another than to B. hypselurus, the sister group to the clade formed by the former two species.  Species  * Breitensteinia cessator Ng & Siebert, 1998 * Breitensteinia hypselurus Ng & Siebert, 1998 * Breitensteinia insignis Steindachner, 1881 Distribution and habitat Breitensteinia species inhabit the middle and upper reaches of rivers in Borneo and Sumatra. B. cessator is known from the Batang Hari and Tulangbawan drainages in Sumatra and the Kapuas River drainage in western Borneo. B. hypselurus is known only from the Kapuas River basin in western Borneo. B. insignis comes from the Barito River drainage of southern Borneo. Description Breitensteinia is a genus of akysid catfish lacking an adipose fin but having a long low adipose ridge, with a very long and slender caudal peduncle, with the gill openings not extending above the base of the pectoral spine, with 11-12 principal caudal- fin rays, and with 42-45 vertebrae. Like other akysids and unusually among catfish, they have a low principal caudal fin ray count and more rays in the upper caudal fin lobe than the lower. They have an elongate body, reflected by their high number of vertebrae which is eight to twelve more than in other akysid species, a clear sign of monophyly. Breitensteinia species have a head that is depressed, broad, and covered with small tubercles, a tubular anterior nostril, a narrow occipital process with its tip tapering and reaching predorsal plate, a body with tubercles arranged in five to six longitudinal rows on each side, a dorsal profile rising evenly but not steeply from the tip of snout to the origin of dorsal fin and then sloping gently ventrally from there to the caudal peduncle, a horizontal ventral profile to the origin of the anal fin and then rising to the caudal peduncle, a dorsal fin origin nearer to the tip of the snout than caudal flexure, and a truncate caudal fin. B. hypselurus has a smooth posterior edge to its dorsal fin spine, relatively tall neural spines on the caudal vertebrae, a shorter caudal peduncle, a longer snout, greater distance between the eyes, and fewer vertebrae than the other two species. Between B. insignis and B. cessator, B. cessator has larger eyes, greater distance between the eyes, and evenly scattered brown spots on the dorsal and pectoral fins, while B. insignis has smaller eyes, less distance between the eyes, and the brown spots on dorsal and pectoral fins concentrated in a dark band near the edges. B. cessator grows to about 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in) SL. B. hypselurus grows to about 12.2 cm (4.8 in) SL. B. insignis grows to about 22.0 cm (8.7 in) SL. The dorsal surface of the head is brown, with dark-brown spots scattered randomly throughout. The dorsolateral and lateral surfaces of the body are dark brown with spots on the dorsolateral surface extending from the predorsal area to the base of the caudal fin. The adipose ridge is light brown. In B. cessator and B. insignis, a small patch of light brown is occasionally present on the predorsal area. The belly, chest, and ventral surface of the head is cream or light brown, with a few scattered brown spots in B. insignis. In B. cessator, the dorsal and pectoral fins are cream with numerous brown spots scattered throughout and the pelvic and anal fins are cream with one or two dark-brown bands, one present occasionally at the base of the fins and another in the distal half of the fins; in B. hypselurus and B. insignis, the dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins are cream with a dark-brown band in the distal half of the fins. The caudal fin is cream with a dark brown band in the distal half and with a narrow midlateral prolongation. The barbels and pectoral spines are cream or light brown, with dark-brown spots, only present sometimes on the dorsal surfaces in B. cessator and B. insignis. Sexual dimorphism is exhibited by B. insignis. Males have the anus situated immediately in front of a genital papilla, which is located immediately posterior to the pelvic-fin base. The genital opening is situated at the tip of the papilla, covered by a fleshy flap. In females, the anus is situated more posteriorly and the genital opening is located at the tip of a short genital appendage. The pelvic fins of females are also more closely set. Ecology Prawns are included in the diet of these fish. Breitensteinia species may moult their skin. This is accompanied by a temporary loss of pigmentation.
