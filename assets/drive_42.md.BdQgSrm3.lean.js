Corbu changed his story about Sauni√®re in 1962 (see below). ==Early life== Born on 27 April 1912 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris to D√©sir√©-Victor-Henri Corbu and Marguerite-Marie Corbu ( Rousseau), the granddaughter of Fran√ßois-de-Sales- Narcisse Rousseau (1810-1866), an attorney based in Clamecy, Ni√®vre who, in the aftermath of the French coup d'√©tat of 1851, had been forced to flee into exile into Belgium to escape deportation to Cayenne. Corbu had an elder brother, ten years his senior named Charles-Pierre Corbu, an airline pilot employed by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale des Transports A√©riens, who died alongside his mechanic, during a test flight of a commercial aircraft carrying no passengers at Le Bourget Airport, on 10 December 1927. The young No√´l Corbu lived in Morocco due to his father being an attach√© at the Embassy there, before obtaining the degree of Doctor of Science in Paris. While living in Perpignan, Corbu met his future wife, Henriette Coll, ten years his senior and a native of the town who was then living at 16, rue J. Tastu, where she ran her business of selling poultry, eggs and cheese. The couple married on 21 January 1935. In the following years, Corbu set up a pasta factory which he named les p√¢tes Claire after his eldest child, his daughter Claire, situated at route d'Elne, Perpignan. By the end of 1942, Perpignan became occupied by German troops. ==Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau== It was soon afterwards that Corbu decided to send his two children, his daughter Claire and her younger brother, to a more remote and less accessible place, to the village of Bugarach. Corbu published his detective novel, Le Mort cambrioleur (\\"The Burglar Dead\\") in 1943.No√´l Corbu, Le Mort cambrioleur (Perpignan, Impr. du Midi, 1943). Republished in 2005. Through the intermediary of his children's school teacher (once Marie D√©narnaud's lodger), Corbu found out that Marie D√©narnaud was selling her estate in Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau.Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, L'H√©ritage De L‚ÄôAbb√© Sauni√®re (Editions B√©lisane, 1985 reprinted in 2000). After two years of hesitation, Marie D√©narnaud finally agreed to sell her property en viager\\"A real estate transaction, popular in France, in which homeowners sell their property to a buyer for an amount of cash equivalent to a down payment in addition to a lifetime of monthly payments. Under this arrangement, the homeowner remains in the home until death, at which point the buyer takes possession\\". to the Corbus and by her Holographic will dated 22 July 1946, she named Corbu and his wife her sole legatees. Marie D√©narnaud could not afford to keep up her estate, which was in need of repairs and she had run into serious debts (that were settled by No√´l Corbu upon purchase). The property comprised the Villa Bethania, the Tour Magdala, an Orangery, and the Belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery.Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du Tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (√âditions B√©lisane, 1985). In 1950 Corbu returned to Morocco hoping to set up a sugar refinery, without success.Vinciane Denis, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, Le Tr√©sor de l'Abb√© Sauni√®re (Paris: Marabout, 1996). When Marie D√©narnaud died in 1953, Corbu inherited her archives relating to B√©renger Sauni√®re. During Easter 1955 Corbu turned the Villa Bethania into a Hotel (called L'h√¥tel de la Tour) and opened a restaurant located underneath the belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery (Corbu installed the windows). Later during the 1990s, the Villa Bethania was turned into a hotel again. In January 1956, the local newspaper La D√©p√™che du Midi serialised an interview with Corbu in who claimed that Father Sauni√®re discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which 'according to the archives' consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis, a prisoner of the Saracens, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. Sauni√®re had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.Albert Salamon, D'un coup de pioche dans un pilier du ma√Ætre-autel, l'abb√© Sauni√®re met √† jour le tr√©sor de Blanche de Castille (\\"With one blow of the pick-axe in a pillar of the main altar Abb√© Sauni√®re uncovered the treasure of Blanche de Castile\\"), in La D√©p√™che du Midi 12, 13, 14 January 1956. Corbu also claimed Sauni√®re had in 1892 discovered \\"parchments\\" whilst renovating his church \\"written in a mixture of French and Latin, which at first glance could be discerned passages from the Gospels\\".Robert Charroux, Treasures of the World, p.220 (Frederick Muller Limited, 1966; English translation by Gloria Cant√π). It has been noted by critics however that Sauni√®re began renovating his church in 1886, not 1892,Jean-Jacques Bedu, Rennes-Le-Ch√¢teau: Autopsie d'un mythe (Ed. Loubati√®res, 1990). and that \\"there was no evidence that these parchments had ever existed\\".Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, The Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, A Mystery Solved, p.112 (Sutton Publishing Limited, revised paperback edition, 2005, ). Corbu claimed that Marie D√©narnaud would confide a secret to him before she died, saying \\"Pray do not worry yourself, Monsieur Corbu. You shall have more money than you will be able to spend!\\" Robert Charroux, Tr√©sors du monde: enterr√©s, emmur√©s, engloutis (Paris: Fayard, 1962). Translated into English in 1967. Corbu provided a tape-recording of his story for his guests, a transcript of which was deposited in the Archives de l'Aude, Carcassonne on 14 June 1962 by Maurice Tous of Alet-les-Bains.Archives d√©partmentales, c√¥te 2J248; Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, The Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau: A Mystery Solved, pages 19; 255 (Revised paperback edition, 2005. ). Corbu's story inspired author Robert Charroux to develop an active interest and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of The Treasure Seekers' Club (that he founded in 1951), scanned the village of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau and its church dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene for treasure using a metal detector. The Dowsing-by-Pendulum enthusiast and hypnotist Rolland Domergue, with medium Germaine Goyard, joined Corbu in 1958 to look for the treasure, and thus began the extensive accumulation of pilgrimages to the site by many various people from all over France, that on 28 July 1965 forced the local Municipal council to introduce a local By-law prohibiting excavations in the village. In April 1961, the French Television Channel RTF made a documentary directed by Marina Grey entitled La Roue Tourne (\\"The Wheel Turns\\"), that cast No√´l Corbu as Father Sauni√®re.Ren√© Descadeillas, Mythologie du Tr√©sor de Rennes: Histoire Veritable de L'Abb√© Sauni√®re, Cur√© de Rennes-Le-Ch√¢teau (M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, Ann√©es 1971-1972, 4me s√©rie, Tome VII, 2me partie; 1974). Corbu then changed his story about Sauni√®re on an interview for the France Inter radio programme to Robert Charroux in 1962,Broadcast on France Inter radio on 30 July 1962 called Aujourd‚Äôhui Le Tr√©sor du cur√© aux milliards (\\"Today, the treasure of the priest with the billions\\").The full transcript of Corbu's radio interview was given in Parle- moi de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau!, Number 2, pages 22-41, 2005 (privately published by Patrick Mensior). dropping all references to Blanche of Castile and claiming that Sauni√®re's alleged treasure discovery relied upon two alleged inscriptions discovered in 1928: one on a gravestone in the cemetery and another on a stone found on farmland property close to Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (Corbu alleged both \\"artifacts\\" were discovered by a retired amateur archaeologist, Ernest Cros, who died in 1946). In the revised edition of his book Treasures of the World published during the 1970s (not translated into English), Robert Charroux added the material given in the 1962 radio interview, but also retained parts of the original chapter on Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau that mentioned Blanche of Castile.Robert Charroux,Tr√©sors du monde, tr√©sors de France, tr√©sors de Paris (Paris: Fayard, 1972). These references to inscriptions by Corbu inspired two documents of unknown provenance called Recherches de Mons. L'Ingenieur en chef Ernest Cros; entreprises dans la Haute Vall√©e de l'Aude, surtout durant les ann√©es 1920 √† 1943, commonly called \\"The Cros Report\\" (one of them is said to have originated on Corbu's typewriter, the other is attributed to Ren√© Chesa).The documents are reproduced in the revised edition of Claire Corbu and Antoine Captier's book, L'h√©ritage de l'Abb√© Sauni√®re (√âditions de l'Oeil du Sphinx, 2012. ). ==Priory of Sion hoax== No√´l Corbu's account of the discovery of the parchments by Father Sauni√®re was later quoted in the document Un Tr√©sor M√©rovingien √† Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau (1966) attributed to \\"Antoine L'Ermite\\",Pierre Jarnac, Les Myst√®res de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, M√©langes Sulfureux, p. 20-21 (CERT, 1994). that for \\"stylistic reasons suggest that this was written by Pierre Plantard and/or Philippe de Ch√©risey\\".John Saul, Janice Glaholm, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, A Bibliography, p. 28 (Mercurius Press, 1985). Philippe de Ch√©risey confessed to having forged the famous parchments that appeared in G√©rard de S√®de‚Äôs 1967 book, L'Or de Rennes (as well as faking \\"The Cros Report\\") in his manuscript \\"Stone and Paper\\".Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau ‚Äì Gisors ‚Äì Le Testament du Prieur√© de Sion, Le Cr√©puscule d‚Äôune T√©n√©breuse Affaire, p.184-228 (Editions P√©gase, 2006, ). The text of the document attributed to \\"Antoine L'Ermite\\" was modelled on Charroux's account found in his book, Tr√©sors du Monde, where he extensively quoted No√´l Corbu. ==Heritage, tourism and archaeology== No√´l Corbu sold the Sauni√®re estate in 1964 to Henri Buthion (1924‚Äì2002) and moved to the Ch√¢teau of Saint-F√©lix-Lauragais which he recently acquired. On 20 May 1968, on his way to Fanjeaux from Montpellier, Corbu's car, a Renault 16 was hit by a truck who had failed to yield the right-of-way. Corbu who was not in the driving seat and not wearing his seat belt, was killed instantly, the driver suffered only minor injuries. Corbu was interred in a burial vault alongside his wife (who died in 1966) in the cemetery of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. The estate has been the property of the local Municipal council since 2000. No√´l Corbu's daughter Claire Corbu with her husband Antoine Captier (whose grandfather was the carillonneur of the church of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, when B√©renger Sauni√®re was the local priest), first published their book L'H√©ritage de l‚ÄôAbb√© Sauni√®re in 1985, reproducing a selection of archives relating to B√©renger Sauni√®re,Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, L'H√©ritage De L‚ÄôAbb√© Sauni√®re (Editions B√©lisane, 1985 reprinted in 2000, revised edition 2012). and in May 1989 opened the Sauni√®re Museum in the village of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau as part of the Association Terre de Rhedae, also part of the local Municipal council. When the Sauni√®re Museum re-opened on 1 March 2009, the story of B√©renger Sauni√®re and the history of Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau was presented in four different languages. The museum was re-opened and re-furbished more recently in 2016 and called Le Mus√©e Domaine de l'Abb√© Sauni√®re. While the local Municipal council superficially accepts the legend of the treasure of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau because it acts as a tourist magnet attracting substantial financial revenue (for example, endorsing DVDs that publicise the legend), the legend is not treated seriously by French archaeology (itself part of the French Ministry of Culture).See for example, Christiane Amiel, \\"L‚Äôab√Æme au tr√©sor, ou l‚Äôor fant√¥me de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau\\" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), Imaginaires arch√©ologiques, pages 61‚Äì86 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: √âditions de la Maison des sciences de l‚Äôhomme, 2008). . For example, when the then village mayor gave the go- ahead to excavate the Tour Magdala in 2003 he was subsequently threatened with legal action by the local body of Direction r√©gionale des affaires culturelles (or DRAC) for doing so without gaining prior official permission and therefore breaching the French Code du patrimoine.La DRAC a port√© plainte contre le Maire de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau pour 'Fouilles illicites\\" suite aux fouilles entreprises sous la Tour Magdala Les Z√©chos de Rhedae, N¬∞24/25 - Octobre/Novembre 2003Code du Patrimoine, Legifrance.gouv.fr ==Published works== *Le Mort cambrioleur (1943), Imprimerie du Midi, 14 rue de la loge, Perpignan.

It was released posthumously on December 15, 1979 and peaked at number 30 on the British album charts. The album features the two singles \\"My Way\\" and \\"Something Else\\". These songs also appeared in the film and album The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle along with \\"C'mon Everybody\\", which did not appear on this album. Most of the album features cover versions of other artists' songs whilst only one original by Vicious is featured on the album, that being \\"Belsen Was a Gas\\", originally a Sex Pistols song that Vicious regularly performed and so far the only known Sex Pistols song that has a solo version done by him. ==Overview== The album is thin on liner notes; there are no musicians' credits or recording info, and the production credit goes to \\"The Engineer,\\" John \\"Boogie\\" Tiberi. The bulk of the album comes from lo-fi recordings of performances at Max's Kansas City in New York on 28, 29 and 30 September 1978. The version of the Johnny Thunders song \\"Born to Lose\\" on this album reportedly comes from a Sex Pistols concert at Huddersfield, on 25 December 1977. During the children's matinee performed during the day, lead singer Johnny Rotten stepped off stage to act as Father Christmas, while the remaining trio played a set, including among other songs \\"Born to Lose\\" and \\"Chinese Rocks\\". Despite having an audio fidelity not much better than the rest of the album, \\"My Way\\" comes from a studio session in Paris with French session musicians. The remixed version that was released as a single and on The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle features a different vocal take, an overdubbed guitar solo from Steve Jones and strings, arranged by Simon Jeffes. But on the video version of the song it features Vicious' vocals on Sid Sings but an instrumental version from The Great Rock and Roll Swindle. There is also another demo version available from the album Too Fast To Live, which is entitled \\"My Way (Take 3)\\". Mick Jones from The Clash was long rumored to play on the album. His two sets with Vicious have now been released on CD in the double album Sid Lives, released by Jungle Records. The album was not designed by Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols' art designer, but he created the guitar swastika that appeared on the labels of the original UK pressings (though the German pressing had a blank spot instead due to the swastika's illegality in that country). ==Track listing== All tracks are live, with the exception of \\"My Way\\". ;Side one #\\"Born to Lose\\" (Johnny Thunders) #\\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" (Iggy Pop, Ron Asheton) #\\"Take a Chance On Me\\" (Jerry Nolan, Walter Lure) #\\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\" (Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart) #\\"My Way\\" (Paul Anka, Claude Fran√ßois, Jacques Revaux) (alternate version without strings) ;Side two #\\"Belsen Was a Gas\\" (Johnny Rotten, Paul Cook, Sid Vicious, Steve Jones) #\\"Something Else\\" (Sharon Sheeley, Eddie Cochran) #\\"Chatterbox\\" (Johnny Thunders) #\\"Search And Destroy\\" (Iggy Pop, James Williamson) #\\"Chinese Rocks\\" (Dee Dee Ramone, Richard Hell) #\\"My Way (I Killed The Cat)\\" (shorter live version Of \\"My Way\\") Tracks 2, 3, 10, 11 ‚Äì 1st set, Max's Kansas City, New York City, September 29, 1978 Tracks 4, 6, 8, 9 ‚Äì 1st set, Max's Kansas City, New York City, September 28, 1978 Track 7 ‚Äì 1st set, Max's Kansas City, New York City, September 30, 1978 Track 5 - Studio de la Grande Armee, Paris, April 10, 1978 There are talking bits edited in from both the 28th and 29th sets, including quite a few from the second set of the 28th, although no music is included from that set.

Its largest business area is the production of nitrogen fertilizer, however it also encompasses the production of nitrates, ammonia, urea and other nitrogen-based chemicals. The company was established in 1905 as Norsk Hydro ‚Äì the world's first producer of mineral nitrogen fertilizers ‚Äì and de-merged as Yara International ASA on March 25, 2004. Yara is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and has its headquarters in Oslo. The company has around 13,000 employees, production sites on six continents, operations in more than 50 countries and sales to about 150 countries. The Norwegian government owns more than a third of Yara and is its largest shareholder. ==Business== The company has three primary areas of activity: * Industrial products: a wide range of nitrogen and specialty chemicals and civil explosive solutions * Environmental solutions: solutions for NOx abatement, odor control, water treatment and corrosion prevention * Agricultural products: complete portfolio of fertilizers and solutions, covering all necessary nutrients for any crop ==History== ===1900‚Äì1919=== The history of Yara dates back to the establishment of Norsk hydroelektiske kvelstoffaktieselskab, or Norsk Hydro, as it later became known, in December 1905 after nitrogen fertilizer was successfully produced at Notodden. Norsk Hydro was founded by Sam Eyde, Kristian Birkeland, and Marcus Wallenberg. In 1903, Birkeland and Eyde had developed direct nitrogen fixation, called the Birkeland-Eyde process, based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784. The company used Norway's large hydroelectric-energy resources to produce its first product. Between 1906 and 1919 Norsk Hydro built two hydroelectric power plants in Notodden and Rjukan. The company sent its first shipment to China in 1913. ===1960‚Äì1977=== Following the successful production of mineral fertilizer, the company expanded into other businesses such as oil and metals. In 1969, Norsk Hydro entered into its first joint venture, with authorities in Qatar. With access to a competitive source of gas and a strategic location in the Middle East, the joint venture opened up a global market for the company. Norsk Hydro was led by Johan Berthin Holte as CEO from 1967 until 1977. By the 1970s, the company was established in Asia, the Middle East and North America. The late 1970s to the mid-1980s was a period of rapid growth, through the acquisition of major fertilizer companies in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. At the end of the 1990s, the company was also established in Brazil and South Africa. ===2004‚Äì2008=== In 2004, Hydro Agri de-merged from Norsk Hydro and became an independent company called Yara International ASA. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on March 25, 2004 and is a leading producer of ammonia, nitrates, nitrogen products, and NPK specialty fertilizers. Since then, Yara has continued to expand its global presence through investments in other countries, with many acquisitions, joint ventures, and new projects, primarily in Africa and North and South America. In July 2006 Yara paid $126 million for a controlling share in Fertibras. This acquisition gave Yara more than 99% of the voting stock in Fertibras and 15% of Fosfertil, the largest producer in Brazil of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. ===2008‚Äì2014=== In 2008, Thorleif Enger retired, and became CEO. On his appointment, Haslestad stated: \\"Yara must continue its growth strategy. The company has many exciting opportunities to pursue, for instance when it comes to the environment, where we contribute to better balance in agricultural development and deliver some interesting industrial solutions to environmental problems.\\" Haslestad held the office until 2014, when the company fired him, saying they needed someone who could complete the upcoming merger negotiations and that Haslestad had been on the point of retiring. Svein Richard Brandtzaeg ten days earlier had decided not to leave Hydro to take over the helm of Yara, after contract negotiations were leaked and charges were laid against Enger, the prior CEO. In January Yara reached an agreement with Vale to sell its Brazilian shares of Fosfertil for $785 million US. Also in 2010, ANZ Bank called in the receivers on the 65% share of Burrup owned by, which was later sold to Yara and to Apache Corporation of New York, which had a gas supply agreement with Burrup. In 2016 the Oswal couple was still litigating the fairness of the proceedings, alleging coercion. Radhika has also been accused of dodging a $186 million tax bill. Also in separate proceedings, her husband is alleged to have taken more than $150 million from entities associated with the fertiliser plant and to have spent the money on private planes and other luxury goods. The two left Perth for Dubai in 2010. On February 25, 2011 the US Treasury Department lifted sanctions that had been in place against Yara subsidiary Libyan Norwegian Fertilizer because of its affiliation with the Libyan government. In March 2011 the Dutch government froze about ‚Ç¨3 billion in Libyan assets, including Yara's Sluiskil joint venture, half-owned by the LIA and the NOCL On August 3, 2011 Yara announced that it was selling its share in its Russian Rossosh NPK plant for $390 million US, or 2.1 billion kroner (NOK) In 2013 Yara was enmeshed in a scandal that involved many companies and transactions that may not have taken place, Dagens N√¶ringsliv. Norway's business daily, reported that Yara had paid over eight million Norwegian krone to Shukri Ghanem, formerly Libya's prime minister, oil minister, and senior commander of the state oil company. Ghanem had been found dead in the Austrian Danube in 2012. Yara issued fictitious invoices to account for the money transfers, which were deposited in the bank account of a relative of Ghanem in the UBS Bank in Switzerland. The Norwegian (√òkokrim) anti-corruption agency noticed the payments in 2011. The head of the upstream segment, Tor Halba, had warned of possible corrupt practices in a 2008 internal email. Investigators came across the payments when they seized business records for two Swiss-based businesses, one of them Yara's fertilizer trading subsidiary, Balderton. Yara's own investigation uncovered additional corruption in India. √òkokrim charged the company with gross corruption in both cases. On October 26, 2013 Yara acquired OFD Holding Inc.(OFD) from Omimex Resources Inc. for US$425 million, gaining production facilities in Colombia and distribution companies across Latin America. ===2014=== Norwegian authorities had been informed by the company in 2011 that it might have been involved in corruption in connection with 2008 negotiations leading to 2009's investment of 1.5 billion Norwegian kroner into a 50% share of Libyan Norwegian Fertiliser Company, or LIFECO.Dagens N√¶ringsliv, 2011-04-16, p.4 In January 2014, the corporation agreed to pay a $48 million fine in a case involving corruption between 2004 and 2009. The company admitted bribing senior government officials in India and Libya, as well as to suppliers in Russia and India. The fine was the largest ever of its kind in Norway. The case puts two cohorts of Yara executives up against each other. On 10 January 2014 the Norwegian Cabinet approved the indictment of former deputy CEO Daniel Clauw in connection with Norway's investigation of Yara. Three other Yara executives were also indicted in the case. They were sentenced July 7, 2015. Enger, the former CEO, received the harshest sentence, three years. The former chief legal officer, Kendrick Wallace, was given a 2¬Ω-year sentence, and Clauw and former upstream coordinator Tor Halba were given two-year sentences.

He completed the gymnasium in Nagyb√°nya/Baia Mare (the first 6 grades) and in Nagyv√°rad/Oradea (the last 2 grades of the gymnasium), before moving on to study Law at the Nagyv√°rad Academy. After graduating from the Oradea Academy in 1859, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti found a clerk's job, but shortly after he was conscripted in the Austrian Imperial Army and participated in the Second Italian War of Independence (1859‚Äì1860). In 1860, after he had been released from the active service, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti returned to his native county, where he worked as first praetor in Hadad/Hodod and as a judge. In 1860, he married Maria Lo»ôon»õi, with whom he had 2 children: Maria Carolina (who died at the age of 1 on 16 January 1862) and Elena (1862‚Äì1940). According to a source, Maria Lo»ôon»õi, the widow of the Baron Sebe»ôi, had had with Pop de BƒÉse»ôti in 1859 another daughter out of wedlock, Ana, before they married one year later. ==Political activity== ===Deputy in the Diet of Hungary=== Ethnic groups of the Hungarian Kingdom according to the 1880 census (ethnic Romanians depicted in grey) On 22 June 1872, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was elected for the first time deputy in the Hungarian diet in the Szil√°gycseh electoral district, where, for the following nine years (he was again elected in 1875 and 1878), he advocated for the rights of ethnic Romanians living in Transylvania. In that capacity Pop de BƒÉse»ôti protested vehemently against the consequences of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Magyarization conducted via the education laws of 1868 and 1879, the Nationalities Law, the Electoral and Press laws, comparing the status of the Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary with that of the Irish in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: \\"For the Ireland of the Magyar state, for this is what the unfortunate Transylvania is, we have endured in these lands for longer than 2000 years. All our tribulations and hopes bond us to the land on which we live\\". On the adoption of the Trefort education bill in 1879, which sought to make the Hungarian language mandatory in primary and confessional schools, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti stated the following: \\"If it's a sin to make an attempt on another man's life, in the case of the present law it is a greater sin to make an attempt on the life of an ethnicity, even of more nationalities, of all nationalities of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen\\". Pop de BƒÉse»ôti's personality gained the respect of his political opponent K√°lm√°n Tisza, who declared: \\"You're a fierce man, fanatical Daco-Romanian! We are a world apart from each other. We shall never find any common ground. However I respect the deep convinction with which you defended so heartily the cause of your people\\". In 1879, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti resigned from the (where he held the position of vice president) after having lost the belief that Romanians' and Hungarians' interests could be reconciled. His resignation provided the occasion for K√°lm√°n Tisza to attempt convincing Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti to join his party: \\"We would need brave and determined men. Come and join us and I guarantee there is no dignity in Hungary you couldn't obtain\\", to which Pop de BƒÉse»ôti replied: \\"Even if you gave me the whole Hungary I would not betray the righteous cause of my poor and unfortunate people, who, beside God, my comrades and myself, has no other defenders against your oppressive tendencies\\". ===Romanian National Party=== Subsequently, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti joined the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania. Between 12‚Äì14 May 1881, he participated at the national conference in Nagyszeben that sealed the merger of the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania with the National Party of Romanians in Banat and Hungary into the Romanian National Party (, PNR). Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was also elected in the executive committee of the party as the central coordinator for the Szil√°gy, Szatm√°r and M√°ramaros counties. In 1881, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti ran again for a deputy seat in Szil√°gycseh, however he lost after the authorities called in 120 gendarmes from 5 surrounding counties. He would not run again until 1905, after the PNR had abandoned the strategy of political passivism. ===The Transylvanian Memorandum=== At the 1887 national conference of the PNR the participants voiced their grievances in regard to the worsening situation of the ethnic Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary and decided to present the Emperor a petition encompassing the growing complaints against the consequences of the Ausgleich: the discrimination and the Magyarization process conducted against the ethnic Romanians, their underrepresentation in the Hungarian Parliament through the electoral laws despite their demographic majority in Transylvania and the way the Ausgleich was adopted, without consulting the Transylvanians. Nevertheless, at the next national conference (1890) it was decided to postpone this endeavor to a later, more convenient date. As a result of this decision, in November 1891, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti asked for the resignation of the PNR president Vincen»õiu Babe»ô and argued that the leadership of PNR should be taken over \\"by an appeasing person, with a calm temperament and above all totally independent and master of his own ideas and beliefs\\". The signatories of the Memorandum (among them Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, third from the left, bottom row) Heeding his call, the delegates of the PNR elected in 1892 as president and Pop de BƒÉse»ôti as vice president of the PNR. The new leaders decided to task Vasile Lucaciu and Iuliu Coroianu with drafting and publishing the petition. Under the name of \\"Transylvanian Memorandum\\", the petition was approved by the PNR on 25 March 1892 and brought on 28 May 1892 to Vienna by 300 delegates of the PNR (among them 48 members from Szil√°gy County, including Pop de BƒÉse»ôti) to be presented to the Emperor Franz Joseph in a sealed envelope. At the request of the Hungarian government, Franz Joseph did not receive the delegation and forwarded the unopened envelope to the Hungarian Prime-Minister, which in turn forwarded it unopened to the Torda-Aranyos Isp√°n in order to be returned to the sender, Ioan Ra»õiu, arguing that the Hungarian Ministry of Interior was not authorized to present the Emperor with petitions of individuals not entitled to represent the ethnic Romanians in Hungary. The building (called \\"Redoubt\\", nowadays the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania) where the trial took place between 7 and 27 May 1894 V√°c Prison (as of 2015) Met with refusal, PNR published the memorandum in the press. Tensions ran high: Ra»õiu's home in Torda was damaged by Hungarian demonstrators, leading to protests in Romania. After a while, the government in Budapest gave in to pressure from the Hungarian nationalists and in May 1893 it launched proceedings against the PNR president, Ra≈£iu, the vice president, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, the secretaries Vasile Lucaciu and Septimiu Albini, and other PNR leaders who acknowledged their involvement in drafting and publishing the petition. Consequently, on 7 May 1894, 14 leaders of the PNR, including Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, were put on trial in Kolozsv√°r for various charges, ranging from disturbing the peace to high treason. On 25 May 1894, the verdicts were handed down: all the accused were found guilty, and on 27 May 1894, the judge sentenced them to imprisonment for terms ranging from 5 years (Vasile Lucaciu) to 1 year, in total 31 years and 2 months. Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was handed the mildest sentence (of one-year imprisonment), his only regret being that he received less than the others. Present at the trial, Octavian Goga witnessed that moment: \\"All the accused acknowledged the sentences in a manful manner. Leading the group, Father Lucaciu seemed to be an ancient hero. Mr. Ra»õiu came in with his head held high. [..] Only Brother Gheorghe wept because he said they mocked him by handing him a milder sentence than his fellows.\\" On 28 July 1894, the PNR was banned by the Hungarian authorities, who invoked the lack of a party statute and \\"relations with foreign elements\\". Pop de BƒÉse»ôti served his sentence in the V√°c prison until 5 August 1895. As his wife Maria passed away he was shortly released on parole on 11 June 1895 so that he could attend her burial. Eventually all signatories of the memorandum were pardoned by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1895, following secret negotiations between Austria-Hungary and the Romanian king Carol I. ===Later political activity=== Greek Catholic Church in Szil√°gysomly√≥/»òimleu Silvaniei during the Annual General Meeting of ASTRA, held between 7 and 9 August 1908. Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti is the first from the right, front row After Ioan Ra»õiu's death in 1902, Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was elected president of the PNR. On 10 January 1905, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti summoned the national conference of the PNR in Nagyszeben, where it was decided to rescind the policy of political passivism and to engage again in the electoral process. At the elections that year he ran for the deputy seat in Szil√°gycseh, nevertheless he lost in the second round against the Liberal candidate, Baron Elem√©r Bornemisza, after harsh measures had been employed to rig the results: Pop de BƒÉse»ôti (then 69 years old) and his supporters were beaten (some of them to death) by political opponents. The situation would repeat during the 1906 elections. ===Philanthropic work=== Although he never abandoned politics, Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti focused on providing for poor children in his native area, sponsoring Romanian-language magazines in Transylvania (Federa»õiunea, Lupta, Gazeta de Transilvania) and founding credit unions to help the ethnic Romanians. By 1909, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti led 6 credit unions: \\"Aurora\\" (Nayb√°nya/Baia Mare), \\"Chiorana\\" (Nagysomk√∫t/»òomcuta Mare), \\"Codreana\\" (Szil√°gyill√©sfalva/BƒÉse≈üti), \\"SƒÉtmƒÉreana\\" (Szin√©rv√°ralja/Seini), \\"SƒÉlƒÉgeana\\" and \\"Silvania\\" (Szil√°gysomly√≥/»òimleu Silvaniei). He also served in the board of directors of the ' and wrote a book about agriculture. When the World War I started, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti decided to write his testament and leave his whole wealth (estimated at around 4 million Kronen) to the Greek Catholic Metropolitan in Bal√°zsfalva/Blaj. The will provided that the donated wealth was to be used to establish agricultural schools and Romanian cultural institutes, to award scholarships and to help preserve the local church and school in his native village of BƒÉse»ôti. ===President of the Alba Iulia National Assembly=== The National Assembly in Alba Iulia (1 December 1918) Towards the end of World War I, the Austrio-Hungarian monarchy began to disintegrate. On 18 October 1918, inspired by Wilson's Fourteen Points and mandated by the executive committee of the PNR, deputy Alexandru Vaida-Voevod demanded in the Hungarian Diet the right of self-determination of the Romanians in Hungary, and afterwards the executive committee established the Romanian National Council, which proceeded to organize elections for a National Assembly of all Romanians in Hungary. On 30 November 1918 Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, elected as a representative and accompanied by lieutenant Alexandru Ki»ô of the Romanian National Guard, set off by train to Alba Iulia, despite his old age. The trip was not without incident: in the RƒÉzboieni railway station their railcar was fired upon by the Hungarian National Guard, killing . However, according to other sources, Ioan Arion, the 24-year old representative of Agri»ô, was killed in the Teiu»ô railway station. After he had arrived in Alba Iulia, on a blistering cold day, the monk Leon Manu asked him: \\"For the love of God, Brother George, how could you venture to make such a long and exhausting journey on such weather?\\", to which Pop de BƒÉse»ôti replied: \\"How could I have missed it since I've been waiting for this day for 80 years? I came even if I should pay with my life for this, because now nothing else remains for me to say but the following, like the righteous Simeon of the Gospels: 'Lord, now let your servant depart in peace'\\". The event in Alba Iulia attracted large crowds, which put the local lodging capacity under strain. After a long wait and repeated requests, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti and lieutenant Ki»ô were finally given an unheated room in the Hotel \\"Hungaria\\" (whose name was later changed to \\"Dacia\\"). They were later joined there by Pop de BƒÉse≈üti's son-in-law Francisc Hossu-Longin, who was the representative of Deva in the National Assembly. The Alba Iulia Military Casino (nowadays Union Hall), where the representatives of the National Assembly convened on 1 and 2 December 1918 On 1 December 1918, at Iuliu Maniu's proposal, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was elected president of the Assembly. As a leading figure of the PNR he unified all the divergent currents in the Assembly and bridged the differences, his election as president ending all rivalries among the representatives. In his opening speech he emphasized that the National Assembly of all Romanians of Transylvania and the Banat was destined to obliterate the bondage of the past, ending with the following words: \\"Brethren, let yourselves be enthralled by the holy joy of this bright national feast and in the utmost brotherly harmony let us lay the foundation of our future happiness. God bless this assembly and its resolutions\\". On the same day the Assembly unanimously decreed the union between the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania, the Banat, Cri»ôana and Maramure»ô. The next day the Assembly established the () as the provisional parliament of Transylvania, and the () as the provisional government of Transylvania, electing Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti as president of the High Council and Iuliu Maniu as president of the Directory Council. After closing the session of the High National Romanian Council, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti repeated the words attributed to Simeon: \\"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace\\", adding \\"as I have seen the salvation of my people\\". ==Death== Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti Memorial House (as of 2014) After spending a couple of days at his daughter's house in Deva and two night stops in Teiu»ô and Cluj (also not without incidents), on the way back from the Ulmeni railway station to his home in BƒÉse»ôti, on an icy weather, Pop de BƒÉse»ôti caught a severe cold that would confine him to bed. According to another source, his overnight stay in the unheated hotel room in Alba Iulia was another cause for him becoming ill. The prolonged illness caused his death a few months later on 23 February 1919, at the age of 83, after skirmishes of the initial stage of the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War had been occurring in the neighboring villages of Strem»õ/B√ºkkt√≥tfalu and Ode»ôti/Vadafalva. Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was buried in his native village while the funeral procession was fired upon by Hungarian troops. His epitaph reads: \\"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace\\", the words he uttered at Alba Iulia.

Both of these \\"tracings\\" are made as seen by the signer if right-handed, as shown by the illustrations in this article.

Travis Dougherty explains and demonstrates the ASL alphabet. Voice-over interpretation by Gilbert G. Lensbower. In most drawings or illustrations of the American Manual Alphabet, some of the letters are depicted from the side to better illustrate the desired hand shape. For example, the letters G and H are frequently shown from the side to illustrate the position of the fingers. However, they are signed with the hand in an ergonomically neutral position, palm facing to the side and fingers pointing forward. Several letters have the same hand shape, and are distinguished by orientation. These are \\"h\\" and \\"u\\", \\"k\\" and \\"p\\" (thumb on the middle finger), \\"g\\" and \\"q\\" and, in informal contexts, \\"d\\" and \\"g/q\\". In rapid signing, \\"n\\" is distinguished from \\"h/u\\" by orientation. The letters \\"a\\" and \\"s\\" have the same orientation, and are very similar in form. The thumb is on the side of the fist in the letter \\"a\\", and in front for \\"s\\". ==Rhythm, speed and movement== When fingerspelling, the hand is at shoulder height. It does not bounce with each letter unless a letter appears twice in a row. Letters are signed at a constant speed; a pause functions as a word divider.

He is best known for his creation of fake parchments published in the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes by G√©rard de S√®de, as part of his involvement in the Priory of Sion hoax between 1962-1983. ==Early life== Coming from a wealthy family in the Lorraine, de Ch√©risey decided to become an actor against his family's wishes. He enrolled in the Ren√© Simon drama school in 1946 where he started his actor's training,Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, page 524 (Tome 2, Editions B√©lisane: Nice, 1988) and his most notable film appearance was in Jeux interdits in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy. ==Surrealism== Philippe de Ch√©risey was a follower of the surrealist movement. He claimed acquaintance with Eugene Ionesco and was like him a member of the College of Pataphysics, although - like his membership of Oulipo - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of Dagobert II. He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella Circuit (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the Biblioth√®que nationale de France until 1971). ==Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau== By the early 1960s Philippe de Ch√©risey met Pierre Plantard, and together they developed an interest in Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. From the mid-1950s local hotelier No√´l Corbu circulated a story to boost trade, that the 19th century priest B√©renger Sauni√®re of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile. The author Robert Charroux published Corbu's story in his 1962 book Tr√©sors du Monde.Robert Charroux, Tr√©sors du monde: enterr√©s, emmur√©s, engloutis (Paris: Fayard, 1962). In a letter dated 2 April 1965 to his girlfriend, de Ch√©risey wrote: \\"Don't tell anyone, but I'll be setting out again for four days in the Pyrenees with Plantard to see if we can get any closer to Mary Magdalene.\\"L'ABC de RLC ‚Äì l'Encyclop√©die de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, pages 97-98 (Marseille: √âditions Arqa, 2009). A mixture of de Ch√©risey's humor and surrealism can be identified within his activities relating to the Priory of Sion hoax, Gisors and Rennes- le-Ch√¢teau, contained in his correspondence as well as in his documents that he deposited in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. ===Parchments=== During the early 1960s, de Ch√©risey forged two parchments, photocopies of which appeared in the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes by G√©rard de S√®de.G√©rard de S√®de, L'Or de Rennes ou la Vie insolite de B√©renger Sauni√®re, cur√© de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (Paris: Ren√© Julliard, 1967). De S√®de's book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion. The parchments hinted at the survival of the line of the Frankish king Dagobert II, that Plantard claimed to be descended from, as well as attempting to verify the existence of the 1000-year-old secret society, the Priory of Sion. The two parchments were later used as source material for the 1982 book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which was itself used as a primary source for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code. Other documents, containing fake genealogies, were planted in the French National Library, the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Pierre Plantard and G√©rard de S√®de fell out over book royalties when L'Or de Rennes was published in 1967, at the same time Philippe de Ch√©risey announced that he had forged the parchments. De Ch√©risey elaborated about this in his 1978 unpublished document L'√ânigme de Rennes, claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled Sign√© Furax.Philippe de Ch√©risey, L'√ânigme de Rennes. Biblioth√®que Nationale, EL 4- Z PIECE- 110. D√©p√¥t L√©gal, 6 June 1978 A second document by de Ch√©risey entitled Pierre et papier (\\"Stone and Paper\\") provides a more detailed explanation, giving the more complicated decoding technique to one of the parchments by using a Knight's Tour 25-letter alphabet, omitting the letter \\"w\\", the knowledge of which can only be known to the forger.Quoting Philippe de Ch√©risey from Stone and Paper: \\"my grid decipherment has only 25 letters whereas the French alphabet has 26 ‚Äì I have left out W. Was I cheating? No, not at all, as I drew up Documents I and II in semi-uncial handwriting to give the impression that they dated from an historical period when the letter W was unknown to the Western world as U and V were used instead.\\" Pierre Plantard published a correct Knight's Tour decoding technique in Vaincre Number 3, page 19 (September 1989), showing he held the right information. An English translation of this document, together with a reproduction of the original, was published by Jean-Luc Chaumeil in 2010.Jean-Luc Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion: Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau and the Priory of Sion (Avalonia, 2010). ===Details of the forgeries=== The text of parchment 1 was copied from Codex Bezae,Originally identified by Wieland Willker an Old Latin/Greek diglot from the 5th century CE contained in the book by Fulcran Gr√©goire Vigouroux, Dictionnaire De La Bible (1895).Fulcran Vigouroux, Dictionnaire de la Bible, contenant tous les noms de personnes, de lieux, de plantes, d'animaux mentionn√©s dans les Saintes √âcritures, les questions th√©ologiques, arch√©ologiques, scientifiques, critiques, relatives √† l'Ancien et au Nouveau Testament, Tome Premier 1895 (Paris: Letouzey et An√©, 1895-1912) Philippe de Ch√©risey's reason for copying the passage from the Codex Bezae was his interest in the phrase \\"In Sabbato Secundo Primo\\", also found in the Gospel of Luke 6:1. Philippe de Ch√©risey stated: \\"This phrase has given headaches to the anonymous (secret) societies. It has to be said that 'A day of Sabbath, second first' is not really translatable. No one has ever heard of that. So, as the disciples walk through a cornfield and, being hungry, eat the corn, there and then, it must mean 'Second Sabbath following the first day of the shewbread.' This is the only interpretation we could find.\\" De Ch√©risey went on to provide his own interpretation: \\"In Sabbato Secundo Primo does not mean 'A day of Sabbath, second first' but rather 'As second in command, Sabassius became first.' What is interesting is that the witches' meetings are called 'Sabbaths', not because of the Jewish celebrations, but because of Sabassius, god of the Phrygians\\".Jean-Luc Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion - Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau and the Priory of Sion, pages 149-150 (Avalonia, 2010) This parchment also contained an encrypted message written in modern French: \\"√Ä Dagobert II Roi et √† Sion est ce tr√©sor et il est l√† mort.\\" (translated as \\"To King Dagobert II and to Sion does this treasure belong, and he is there, dead\\"). De Ch√©risey also chose to copy material from Vigouroux because he was a priest connected with the Church of St Sulpice, a location that had been exploited as part of the Priory of Sion myths as created by Plantard and de Ch√©risey, so de Ch√©risey's utilisation of this priest fitted in nicely into these myths. According to an investigation into the Priory of Sion hoax by the American news program 60 Minutes, parchment 2 was copied from a 19th-century version of the Latin Vulgate published by John Wordsworth and Henry J. White Novum Testamentum Domini Nostri Iesu Christi latine secundum sancti Hieronymi (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1889‚Äì1954),Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood. The Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau, A Mystery Solved (Sutton Publishing Limited, Gloucestershire GL5 2BU, England, 2003.) and the original forged parchments are now in the possession of Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a French writer, who states that he had their age analyzed, and it was confirmed that they were merely decades old, not centuries. Chaumeil also has letters by de Ch√©risey, which contain proof that De Ch√©risey was knowingly engaging in a fraud. That Philippe de Ch√©risey was not a specialist of Latin paleography and had even a bit lost his Latin knowledge (got from high school) is demonstrated in his copying of the Latin Text from the Codex Bezae for one of his parchments: for instance, he made several of the most basic errors in copying the Latin uncials, which therefore garbles the spelling of multiple words. This information is frequently omitted by those who present the parchments as being authentic. In an interview during the 1970s with author Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Philippe de Ch√©risey asserted: \\"the parchments of the Gospel according to Saint Luke fabricated by me and for which I pinched the uncial text from the work L'arch√©ologie chr√©tienne (Christian Archaeology) by Dom Cabrol at the National Library, section C25\\".Published in Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Le Tr√©sor du Triangle d'Or, page 80 (Nice: Alain Lefeuvre, 1979). Translation given in Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion, page 148 (Avalonia, 2010). Philippe de Ch√©risey asserted in a letter dated 29 January 1974 to French author Pierre Jarnac: \\"P.S. Do you know that the famous manuscripts supposedly discovered by the Abb√© Sauni√®re were composed in 1965? And that I took responsibility for being the author?\\"Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du Tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, page 268 (L‚ÄôAssociation pour le d√©veloppement de la lecture, 1985; reprinted by Editions B√©lisane: Nice, 1998). According to Henry Lincoln, one of the co- authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail, Plantard admitted to him in person that the various documents had been forged, and identified de Ch√©risey as their creator.Henry Lincoln, The Key To The Sacred Pattern (The Windrush Press, Moreton-in-Marsh, 1997). ===Relationship with Plantard=== A schism developed between Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Ch√©risey in 1983, when de Ch√©risey began collaborating with Paul Rouelle (his dentist) on a book which would have incorporated the Priory of Sion concepts.Paul Rouelle, Court-circuit, avec un feu d'artifices de Philippe de Ch√©risey (written in 1983). Published in 2010 with a preface by Henry Lincoln (Paris: ODS). French author Pierre Jarnac reproduced part of a letter he received dated 22 May 1985 from Pierre Plantard: \\"You need to know only that I have no involvement whatsoever with the 'deathless prose' of Monsieur Philippe de Ch√©risey, who was the co-author with Monsieur Paul Rouelle of the book COURT-CIRCUIT, lodged with the BN in December 1984 or January 1985, which dragged my name through the mud. The Marquis de Ch√©risey was a good friend of mine from university days, but I very often disapprove of his books which are really quite bizarre.\\"Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, page 550 (Tome 2, Editions B√©lisane: Nice, 1988) ==Later years== Philippe de Ch√©risey died in Paris on 17 July 1985, while working to finish an encyclopedia of trema.Cf. and about the first part published in 1979. His funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris and he was buried in the family vault at R≈ìux (Pas-de-Calais).Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, page 525 (Tome 2, Editions B√©lisane: Nice, 1988) His death was announced by Gino Sandri in number 10 of Etudes M√©rovingiennes (August 1985), the journal of the association Cercle Saint Dagobert II. ==Works== *Un mauvais quart d'heure √† passer, ou La Vengeance de la grosse molaire ( and Pierre Tchernia, 1949).

Man.Network (Originally published in Play magazine, volume 3, issue 4 (April 2004)). Archived from the original on December 15, 2005. Retrieved June 29, 2013. is a fictional character from Capcom's Mega Man video game series. Proto Man first appeared in the 1990 video game Mega Man 3, and was known as Break Man (though Proto Man's in-game appearance differs slightly from Break Man's). At the end of Mega Man 3, Dr. Light reveals that Break Man's actual name is Proto Man, and that he is Mega Man's older brother. == Appearances == ===Video games=== Proto Man is the early prototype of Mega Man that made his first appearance in NES game Mega Man 3 (1990) and is found in the Magnet Man, Hard Man, Shadow Man and Gemini Man levels. He has a grey and red uniform and a yellow scarf. He wears a red helmet with a silvery decoration and a dark visor which hides his eyes. He always appears after his distinctive whistle. At the end of Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, it is revealed by Dr. Light that Proto Man's body has a fatal defect in its energy system, and as a result is in great pain and has a more limited lifespan. In Mega Man Powered Up, Proto Man reveals in a dialog with the Yellow Devil that his reactor is already unstable, which due to being a Nuclear reactor, could result in disaster with \\"one big shock\\". In the various Mega Man manga, Proto Man has appeared in casual clothing, usually standing atop a building wearing a trenchcoat, sunglasses, slacks, and black shoes. His scarf is tucked into the trenchcoat, but still noticeable. He can be unlocked as a playable character in Mega Man Powered Up, the PlayStation Portable remake of the first Mega Man game, as well as in Mega Man 9 as part of that game's extra downloadable content in the original release or in the Legacy Collection 2 release of Mega Man 9 by either completing the game or by using the secret code at the Mega Man 9 title screen.Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is available now! -Capcom Unity He is also a playable character in Mega Man 10. ===Other appearances=== In the Ruby-Spears Mega Man cartoon, Proto Man, having been reprogrammed by Dr. Wily, is villainous and serves as Dr. Wily's main henchman alongside Cut Man and Guts Man in the cartoon series, having similar capabilities as Mega Man and identical to his appearance in the games except the fact that he lacks his shield. He is obsessed with destroying Mega Man and sometimes gets in the way of Wily's plots by going out of his way to do so. In Dead Rising 2: Off the Record the player can unlock a Proto Man costume, which can be used by the main character Frank West. Proto Man also appeared in Mega Mans comics published by Archie Comics. Another spin-off of the series, Mega Man Battle Network, features ProtoMan.EXE as a friend and rival of the protagonist, MegaMan.EXE. In this series, the characters are computer programs called \\"NetNavi\\" rather than robots and exist only in the digital world, although connections to the real world exist and progress through the series. Each person has his or her own NetNavi, and are known as \\"operators\\". MegaMan.EXE's operator is Lan, the series protagonist along with MegaMan, while ProtoMan.EXE's operator is Chaud, Lan's rival and a master operator, working with law enforcement. Proto Man also features as a central character in the works of the band the Protomen, namely in their retelling of the Mega Man series as a dystopian rock opera. Proto Man makes a cameo in Nova's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a member of the new \\"Mega Nova Corps.\\" In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Proto Man's armor and helmet (through paid DLC) can be worn by Mii fighters. He also appears as a collectible trophy in the Wii U version. In the following game, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Proto Man appears alongside Bass in Mega Man's updated Final Smash.

Ultimate - Mii Fighter Costumes #3 - Nintendo Switch He is a playable character in the fan-made Mega Man 2.5D. ==Reception== Proto Man's character was generally received with positive critical response by publications for video games. IGN's Colin Moriarty said Proto Man is \\"the biggest addition\\" to Mega Man 10, adding \\"playing as Proto Man adds more depth to the game, and gives you a reason to play through again once you've beaten Mega Man 10.\\" Complex ranked eight a Proto Man action figure on its list of \\"The 50 Coolest Video Game Action Figures and Statues\\". GamesRadar listed him and Mega Man as having one of the best brotherly rivalries in gaming, commenting that he is \\"quite the anti-hero\\" and \\"the cool cat of the two.\\" The same site also said \\"Everyone loves Mega Man, but some fans prefer the bad boy style of his rival/ally Proto Man\\", and listed Proto Man as one of the 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years, adding \\"It's hard to say who‚Äôs the better robot slayer, but Proto Man‚Äôs scarf and shield at least make him the more fashionable of the two.\\" ==References== == External links == * Category:Male characters in video games Category:Mega Man characters Category:Robot characters in video games Category:Robot superheroes Category:Video game characters introduced in 1990 Category:Video game characters who can teleport Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game sidekicks ","title":"Proto Man"},{"id":"1294241","text":"Dr. Anton√≠n Benjamin Svojs√≠k (September 5, 1876‚ÄìSeptember 17, 1938) was the founder of the Czechoslovak Scouting organization Jun√°k.

Williams II. She was aided by an accomplice, a drug dealer and probable lover, Rogers Lacaze. Frank is the only woman on death row in Louisiana, at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. ==Police career== Antoinette Frank applied to the New Orleans Police Department in early 1993. According to author Chuck Hustmyre, a former federal agent and author of the book Killer with a Badge, Frank was caught lying on several sections of her employment application, and failed two standard psychiatric evaluations. Psychiatrist Philip Scurria examined her and advised in no uncertain terms that she should not be hired, saying she was \\"shallow and superficial\\". Despite this, Frank got a second chance to apply. The NOPD was chronically short-handed; at the time, its officers were paid less than in similarly sized cities, and it was losing officers faster than they could be replaced. Its ranks had been decimated by several arrests for murder and drug activity. Many potential applicants were shut out due to a requirement that all officers be residents of New Orleans - a requirement that was only changed in 2014. Additionally, Frank was a black female, and police officials thought having more African-Americans on the force would ease longstanding racial tensions in the majority-black city. Frank was hired on February 7, 1993, and graduated from the Police Academy on February 28. Although Frank graduated near the top of her academy class, her tenure with the NOPD was mostly undistinguished. Her fellow officers thought she was rather shy, had no idea what police work really entailed, and lacked the decisiveness to be a good officer. At times, they thought she veered into irrational behavior. As early as August 1993, Frank's superiors wanted to send her back to the academy for further training. She frequently had to go through supervisory review. On occasion, though, she did distinguish herself, winning \\"Officer of the Month\\" awards from the local Kiwanis Club for her work in the community. ==Relationship with Rogers Lacaze== On November 25, 1994, Frank handled an incident in which Rogers Lacaze, a known drug dealer, had been shot. An investigator with the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DOC) believed this was the first contact between the two, although in her statement, she claims that they met some eight months before the murders. Frank had taken a statement from Lacaze after he was shot on the street, and initially got closer to him in hopes of turning his life around. However, she was smitten by Lacaze's \\"bad boy\\" persona, and their relationship soon turned sexual. She kept up her relationship even though she was well aware she was jeopardizing her career. The association between Frank and Lacaze became noticeable after other police officers witnessed Lacaze driving her car, and even observed him moving her police unit at the scene of an accident she was investigating. On one occasion, Lacaze accompanied her on a complaint call where she introduced him as a \\"trainee\\"; on other occasions, she introduced Lacaze as her nephew. Prior to the murders, others testified that Frank and Lacaze would pull over and rob motorists while in a squad car. Frank refused to discuss her relationship with Lacaze during the DOC investigation, except to say that she was trying to help him. It was later revealed that the two had a sexual relationship. When asked why she would continue the relationship, knowing that Lacaze had been involved in dealing drugs and in a shooting, she responded that she would not disassociate herself from him just because of his past. The investigator also questioned Frank about trying to buy 9mm ammunition for Lacaze at Walmart on the day before the Kim Anh murders, but stated that she was a police officer and that there was nothing wrong with her buying ammunition. In her statement, she claimed that she and Lacaze were not dating and had never been intimate. Frank refused to discuss anything regarding the murders - every time the investigator asked her a question, she told him to \\"look it up in the record,\\" or asserted her innocence. However, during her interview with the DOC investigator, Frank did claim to have had a male suitor, but refused to go into specifics because he worked for the police department. Two men who claimed they met Lacaze at a party on February 4, 1995, John Stevens and Anthony Wallace, testified in court. As the two were leaving the party, a verbal altercation between Stevens and Lacaze ensued, but Wallace suggested that they leave. The two men got in a car and drove several blocks until a police vehicle pulled the car over. Frank, in police uniform, exited the squad car and told both Wallace and Stevens to get out and go to the back of the car. At that point Wallace saw Lacaze, and noticed that he was holding a gun. According to Stevens, Wallace then rushed Lacaze and the two men began fighting, then both Stevens and Frank also jumped in the fray and the weapon discharged. Stevens began running, but another man appeared and grabbed both Lacaze and Wallace. Frank then told the man that \\"Lacaze was the good guy\\" and that Wallace was the one causing the problems. Wallace was restrained until a back-up unit arrived on the scene, when he was subsequently arrested and charged with attempted murder and armed robbery. Irvin Bryant, a civil sheriff in 1995, testified that on the evening of February 4, he observed a stopped police vehicle with its lights flashing. Bryant thought that the officer was making a traffic stop, but as he got closer he saw the officer and two black men fighting on the side of the road. At that time Wallace broke away, ran and picked up a TEC-9 semi-automatic weapon off the grass. Bryant ordered Wallace to drop the gun, which he did immediately and was restrained; Lacaze then lunged towards Wallace but Bryant grabbed him. Frank informed him that Lacaze was with her and ordered him released. Despite his involvement in the altercation, Bryant was never questioned by police and he never gave a formal statement. ==Restaurant robbery murders== damaged after floods resulting from levee failures caused by Hurricane Katrina Officer Ronald A. Williams II After midnight on March 4, 1995, Frank and Lacaze visited Kim Anh, a Vietnamese restaurant run by the Vu family in New Orleans East. Frank had sometimes worked there off-duty as a security guard. As the employees cleaned the closed restaurant, Chau Vu went into the kitchen to count money and entered the dining room of the restaurant to pay Ronald A. Williams II. Williams was a colleague of Frank who had been working as the security guard that night to supplement his policeman's salary. He joined the New Orleans Police Department in 1992 and was a married father of two. When Chau went to pay Williams, Chau noticed Frank approaching the restaurant. Frank and Lacaze had been at the restaurant twice earlier in the night to get leftover food to eat. When Chau had let her out on the last visit, she could not find the front door key, and with Frank returning again for a third time, she sensed something was wrong. Chau ran to the kitchen to hide the money in the microwave. Frank entered the front door using the key that she had stolen from the restaurant earlier, and walked quickly past Williams, pushing Chau, Chau's brother Quoc, and a restaurant employee into the doorway of the restaurant's kitchen. Williams started to follow in hopes of finding out what was going on when shots rang out. Lacaze had slipped behind Williams and shot him in the neck, severing his spinal cord and instantly paralyzing him. As Williams fell, Lacaze continued to shoot him in the head and back, mortally wounding him. As Frank turned back to the dining room of the restaurant, Chau grabbed Quoc to hide somewhere. Chau, Quoc, and the employee hid in the rear of a large walk-in cooler in the kitchen, turning out its light as they entered. They did not know the whereabouts of their other sister and brother, Ha and Cuong Vu, who had been sweeping the dining room floors when Frank entered the restaurant. From inside the cooler, Chau and Quoc could partially see the kitchen and the front of the restaurant. Chau initially could see Frank looking for something in the kitchen. As Frank moved out of Chau's line of vision, additional gunshots were fired but then observed Frank searching where the Vus usually kept their money. Frank and Lacaze had been shouting at Ha and Cuong demanding the restaurant's money, but they did not know where Chau had hidden it. Frank pistol-whipped 17-year-old Cuong when he hesitated in revealing the location of the money. Frank got the money out of a microwave, then shot 21-year-old Ha three times as she knelt pleading for her life. Then, she shot Cuong six times. After Frank and Lacaze left the premises, Chau tried frantically to call 911 on her cell phone, but the cooler prevented her from getting a usable signal. Quoc emerged from the cooler and ran out the back door of the restaurant to a nearby friend's home to call 911 to report the murders. The robbers fled the restaurant, and Frank dropped off Lacaze at a nearby apartment complex, both knowing that there were witnesses left behind. Frank heard the 911 call on her portable police radio saying that an officer was down at the Kim Anh restaurant. She borrowed a patrol car and returned to the scene. Posing as a responding officer, she intended to kill Chau and Quoc in order to ensure there would be no witnesses. Parking in the rear, Frank entered through the back door of the restaurant and made her way through the kitchen to the dining room, where Chau waited for help at the front door. As Chau bolted through the restaurant's front door to the safety of arriving officers, Frank immediately identified herself as a police officer. Chau told Frank that she knew what she had done and cried to the officers that Frank had committed the crimes. Eddie Rantz, the homicide detective who worked the case, believed Frank and Lacaze planned the robbery to get revenge on Williams. Frank believed Williams was shortchanging her on hours and pay at the Kim Anh, and wanted revenge. Rantz subsequently described Frank as the most cold-hearted person he'd ever encountered in three decades as an officer. Chau and Frank were questioned in detail while seated at different tables in the restaurant. Frank was arrested and charged with three counts of first degree murder. Lacaze was arrested and charged later that night. Frank was taken to police headquarters for additional questioning, where she later confessed to the crimes along with Lacaze. She was believed to be the first New Orleans police officer to have been charged with killing a fellow officer. ==Trial and conviction== Frank and Lacaze were indicted by an Orleans Parish grand jury on April 28, 1995. Their trials were severed, and Lacaze was tried first on July 17‚Äì21, 1995, before Judge Frank Marullo. He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to death. His main tip-off had been using Williams' Chevron credit card at a Chevron station in Gretna just minutes after the robbery and murders. Frank's trial began on September 5, 1995, also before Marullo. Although Frank's attorneys had subpoenaed 39 witnesses, they didn't call a single one. On September 12, 1995, the jury needed only 22 minutes to return a guilty verdict on all counts‚Äîat the time, a record for a capital murder case in New Orleans. The next day, they needed only 45 minutes to recommend the death penalty.Sanz, Cynthia. A Killer in Blue. People, 1995-10-02. She was formally sentenced to death on October 20, 1995, and sent to Death Row at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women (LCIW) in St. Gabriel, near Baton Rouge.Davis, Robert Leon. My visit with Antoinette Frank on death row: convicted cop killer, undated circa 2008‚Äì2009. ==Aftermath and later developments== Officer Williams was interred in Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery on March 7, 1995. His name was inscribed on the Memorial Wall at The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington D.C. Initially, the Vu family kept the restaurant open at the site of the tragedy in New Orleans East for a decade, until suffering flood damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and post-storm looters stealing jewelry which Ha and Cuong had been wearing when they were killed. After that, Quoc Vu and his mother Nguyet sold the location, re-opening the restaurant in Harahan, and moving their residence to Metairie, where they said they felt safer.Giusti, Autumn C. \\"Why Stay? Vu family stays because of the kindness of the people of New Orleans\\", New Orleans CityBusiness. June 11, 2007; . Retrieved on November 3, 2010. In 1993, a year and a half before the murders at the Kim Anh, Frank's father had stayed at her home for a time before she then reported him missing. In November 1995, a month after she received her first death sentence, a dog led police to find a human skull with a bullet hole buried under Frank's house. In a 2005 retrospective, Chuck Hustmyre said, \\"As for those human bones unearthed beneath Frank‚Äôs house, so far, authorities have made no serious effort to identify them. The 10-year-old case, they say, remains under investigation.\\"Hustmyre, Chuck. \\"Blue on Blue: Murder, Madness and Betrayal in the NOPD\\", New Orleans Magazine, February 2005, accessed September 9, 2011. Police and prosecutors believe that the skull was that of Adam Frank, and that Antoinette murdered him. However, since she is facing the death penalty in the Kim Anh murders, they have made no effort to try her for her father's death. On October 18, 2006, Frank's lawyers argued before the Louisiana Supreme Court that her death sentence should be overturned because she was denied state- funded experts to help prepare for the sentencing phase of the trial. They argued that the defense needed to conduct \\"an investigation into the defendant's background for possible mitigating evidence.\\" Frank's attorneys introduced the testimony of psychiatrists who said that possible traumatic events in Frank's childhood could have affected her behavior at the time of the murders and she may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. A psychiatrist retained by the state disagreed that Frank showed symptoms of trauma; he agreed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial tendencies given to Frank by doctors at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women. On May 22, 2007, the state Louisiana Supreme Court ruled 5‚Äì2 that the death penalty should be upheld. On April 22, 2008, District Judge Frank Marullo signed the death warrant for Antoinette Frank. According to the warrant, Frank was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on July 15, 2008. In May, however, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued a 90-day stay of execution effective June 10 pending ongoing appeals. On September 11, 2008 the day that the state supreme court stay was to end, a new death warrant was signed by the same judge. According to this second warrant, Frank was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, 2008. In a new round of appeals, defense attorneys argued they had had too little time to review the voluminous record before the deadline for filing appeals. The state supreme court ruled on the case again. Their decision, made public November 25, 2008 effectively voided the death warrant signed by Judge Marullo in September. In September 2009, Frank's lawyers moved to have Judge Marullo removed from her ongoing post-conviction appeals on grounds of bias, given that he had already signed two death warrants for her. Louisiana state Judge Laurie White heard the motion in September 2009 and, on January 3, 2010 ruled that Marullo should not be taken off the case. Frank's attorney stated she would appeal the ruling to the state's supreme court, which had already overruled both of Marullo's death warrants.Filosa, Gwen. \\"Antoinette Frank case to stay in Marullo's courtroom\\", Times-Picayune, January 4, 2010 accessed September 9, 2011. However, yet another lower court state judge, ruled in October 2010 that Marullo had to be recused from the Frank and Lacaze cases because it was unclear if he had been open with the defense teams about his own surprising connection to the gun used in the restaurant murders. Marullo's signature appeared on an order authorizing Frank to take the murder weapon from the evidence room; Marullo has long maintained the signature was forged.Filosa, Gwen. \\"Kim Anh trial judge's testimony sought during appeal seeking post-conviction relief\\", Times-Picayune, September 11, 2009 accessed September 9, 2011.Gill, James.

On July 23, 2015, retired district judge Michael Kirby threw out Rogers Lacaze's conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial. Kirby said that Lacaze deserved a new trial because one of the jurors hid the fact that he was a Louisiana state trooper and previously worked as a railroad policeman. At the time, commissioned law enforcement officers were legally barred from sitting on a jury. Kirby wrote that while he felt the evidence of Lacaze's guilt was \\"overwhelming\\", the juror misconduct amounted to a \\"structural defect\\" and a \\"violation of a constitutional right so basic to a fair trial\\" that the only remedy was a new trial. Kirby's ruling has no effect on Frank's conviction. An appellate court later overturned the new trial order for Lacaze. 4th Circuit appellate judges Edwin Lombard, Paul Bonin and Madeleine Landrieu ruled \\"After review of the state's writ application in light of the applicable law and arguments of the parties, we find that the trial court erred in finding that the seating of Mr. Settle on the defendant's jury was a structural error entitling him to a new trial\\". Frank was profiled in an episode of Deadly Women in 2009, Snapped: Killer Couples in 2015, and I'd Kill For You in 2016. LCIW was damaged by 2016 flooding, so its prisoners, including Frank, were moved to other prisons. Lacaze was re-sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on December 13, 2019. Lacaze is serving his sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary (\\"Angola\\") in West Feliciana Parish. ==See also== *List of women on death row in the United States *Len Davis - another New Orleans police officer on death row ==Sources== ===General sources=== * * ==References== ==Further reading== * Dittrich, Stacy, (2009), Murder Behind the Badge: True Stories of Cops Who Kill, Prometheus Books. * Hustmyre, Chuck, (2008), Killer with a Badge: The Story of Antoinette Frank, The Copkilling Cop, Iuniverse Books.

Epidendroideae is larger than all the other orchid subfamilies together, comprising more than 15,000 species in 576 genera. Most epidendroid orchids are tropical epiphytes, typically with pseudobulbs. There are, however, some terrestrials such as Epipactis and even a few myco-heterotrophs, which are parasitic upon mycorrhizal fungi. They typically contain the remaining orchids with a single, fertile anther ( = monandrous), which is also fully incumbent ( = strongly convex) to suberect (= ascending towards the edges). The anther form arises from column elongation or, as in the vandoids, from early anther bending. The incumbent anther forms a right angle with the column axis or is pointed backward in many genera. Most have hard pollinia, i.e. a mass of waxy pollen or of coherent pollen grains. The pollinia are with caudicle and viscidium or without. The stigma are entire or three-lobed; a beak is present. The apical part of the middle stigma lobe forms a stipe ( = pollinium stalk). The ovary is unilocular. The leaves are distichous or spiraling, growing on thickened stems. The Epidendroideae are difficult to classify. They have been divided in ‚Äúlower epidendroids‚Äù and ‚Äúhigher epidendroids‚Äù. ==Description== Epiphytes are plants which grow above the ground, on top of other plants. They are not planted in the soil and are not parasitic (i.e. they do not feed on other plants; however, some types still damage their host in various ways). By growing on other plants, the epiphytes can reach to the light better or where they can avoid struggling for light. Many mosses and lichens are epiphytes, as are approximately 10 per cent of all seed plants and ferns. Epiphytes are common in some groups of plants, such as ferns, mosses, lichens, and algae. Over half of the 20,000 species of orchids are epiphytes. ==Habitat== Most epiphytic seed plants and ferns are found in tropical and subtropical rainforests because they need high humidity to survive. The areas which most epiphytes grow are the montane rainforests. Epiphytic orchids are found on many positions of the host tree, depending on species requirements and size, some large species will grow in a fork, whereas some small species scramble through thin branches, other species will climb up the trunk etc. etc. The trees provide many habitats with different conditions of temperature, contact and light. In temperate places, epiphytes are most common in moist forests, such as the rainforests in Queensland. ==Adaptation== Epiphytes are not adapted to droughts in the same way are other flora, because they don‚Äôt have access to the ground, but they still have some mechanisms to help them survive. Some become completely dormant for months at a time; many epiphytes show crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which involves taking in CO2 at night, and photo-fixing it during the day with closed stomata to reduce water loss by transpiration. They also contain absorptive plants that are capable at quickly taking up water when it is available and preventing drought when water is scarcer. CAM can be impeded by higher night-time temperatures, dehydrated tissues, and high saturation deficits in the surrounding air, which lower the \\"stomata conductance\\" of the epiphytes, reducing the CO2 uptake, which in turn reduces growth and reproduction and even induces carbon loss. Higher temperatures, strain on evaporation, and contact to light cause CAM- idling, which is the epiphyte closing its stomata when it becomes stressed, that brings down the range of habitats a species can inhabit. Epiphyte species work biomasses are much more sensitive to different relative moisture levels than other plants. ==Tribe classification== The subfamily Epidendroideae is divided into two clades or subgroups known as the higher epidendroids and the lower epidendroids. The higher epidendroids are partly monophyletic and partly polyphyletic (tribes Arethuseae and Epidendreae). The tribes are listed below: This classification has a rather ephemeral nature and is prone to frequent revision. Changes are likely to occur as new morphological and genetic data become available.Cameron, Kenneth M. et al. American Journal of Botany. 1999.

Wilhelm Traugott Krug (22 June 177012 January 1842) was a German philosopher and writer. ==Life== Krug was born at Radis in Saxony, and died at Leipzig. He studied at Wittenberg under Franz Volkmar Reinhard and Karl Gottfried Jehnichen, at Jena under Karl Leonhard Reinhold, and at G√∂ttingen. From 1801 to 1804 he was professor of philosophy at Frankfurt (Oder), after which he succeeded Immanuel Kant in the chair of logic and metaphysics at the University of K√∂nigsberg. From 1809 till his death he was professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig. He fought in the War of Liberation (1813‚Äì14) as captain of mounted chasseurs. ==Views== In philosophy his method was psychological; he attempted to explain the Ego by examining the nature of its reflection upon the facts of consciousness. Being is known to us only through its presentation in consciousness; consciousness only in its relation to Being. Both Being and Consciousness, however, are immediately known to us, as also the relation existing between them. By this Transcendental Synthesis he proposed to reconcile Realism and Idealism, and to destroy the traditional difficulty between transcendental, or pure, thought and things in themselves. Krug challenged Schelling to deduce his quill or pen from German Idealism's Philosophy of Nature. In so doing, he challenged the thinking that particular, perceptually real things could be logically known from general concepts. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Philos. des XIX. Jahrh. (1835‚Äì1837) contains criticisms of Hegel and Schelling. He was a prolific writer on a great variety of subjects, excelling as a popularizer rather than as an original thinker. His work stimulated freedom of thought in religion and politics, and he was a firm supporter of Jewish emancipation.Gotthard Deutsch, S. Mannheimer, \\"Krug, Wilhelm Traugott\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. ==Personal life== In 1804, Krug married Wilhelmine von Zenge (1780‚Äì1852), the eldest daughter of a Prussian major-general.

Battery electric buses and trains are charged at charging stations. It is a common type of current collector.

Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.US Patent No. 764,224The Street Railway Journal, Vol.24, No.3, July 16, 1904, p.116The Key Route, Harre Demoro, v.1, pp.16-17, publ. Interurban Press (1985) They appear in photographs of the first day of service, 26 October 1903. For many decades thereafter, the same diamond shape was used by electric-rail systems around the world and remains in use by some today. The pantograph was an improvement on the simple trolley pole, which prevailed up to that time, primarily because the pantograph allows an electric-rail vehicle to travel at much higher speeds without losing contact with the overhead lines, e.g. due to dewirement of the trolley pole. Notwithstanding this, trolley pole current collection was used successfully at up to on the Electroliner vehicles of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, also known as the North Shore Line. == Modern use == The most common type of pantograph today is the so-called half-pantograph (sometimes 'Z'-shaped), which evolved to provide a more compact and responsive single-arm design at high speeds as trains got faster. Louis Faiveley invented this type of pantograph in 1955.Louis Faiveley, Current Collecting Device, , granted May 3, 1960. The half-pantograph can be seen in use on everything from very fast trains (such as the TGV) to low-speed urban tram systems. The design operates with equal efficiency in either direction of motion, as demonstrated by the Swiss and Austrian railways whose newest high performance locomotives, the Re 460 and Taurus, operate with them set in the opposite direction. In Europe the geometry and shape of the pantographs are specified by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. == Technical details == The (asymmetrical) 'Z'-shaped pantograph of the electrical pickup on the Berlin Stra√üenbahn. This pantograph uses a single-arm design The electric transmission system for modern electric rail systems consists of an upper, weight-carrying wire (known as a catenary) from which is suspended a contact wire. The pantograph is spring-loaded and pushes a contact shoe up against the underside of the contact wire to draw the current needed to run the train. The steel rails of the tracks act as the electrical return. As the train moves, the contact shoe slides along the wire and can set up standing waves in the wires which break the contact and degrade current collection. This means that on some systems adjacent pantographs are not permitted. Flexity Outlook LRV with its pantograph raised. Note the trolley pole in the rear, which provides compatibility with sections not yet upgraded for pantograph operation. Pantographs are the successor technology to trolley poles, which were widely used on early streetcar systems. Trolley poles are still used by trolleybuses, whose freedom of movement and need for a two-wire circuit makes pantographs impractical, and some streetcar networks, such as the Toronto streetcar system, which have frequent turns sharp enough to require additional freedom of movement in their current collection to ensure unbroken contact. However, many of these networks, including Toronto's, are undergoing upgrades to accommodate pantograph operation. Pantographs with overhead wires are now the dominant form of current collection for modern electric trains because, although more fragile than a third rail system, they allow the use of higher voltages. Pantographs are typically operated by compressed air from the vehicle's braking system, either to raise the unit and hold it against the conductor or, when springs are used to effect the extension, to lower it. As a precaution against loss of pressure in the second case, the arm is held in the down position by a catch. For high-voltage systems, the same air supply is used to \\"blow out\\" the electric arc when roof-mounted circuit breakers are used. == Single and double pantographs == Close up of a single arm pantograph on a British Rail Class 333. Diagram of parts of a pantograph from ICE S Pantographs may have either a single or a double arm. Double-arm pantographs are usually heavier, requiring more power to raise and lower, but may also be more fault-tolerant. On railways of the former USSR, the most widely used pantographs are those with a double arm (\\"made of two rhombs\\"), but since the late 1990s there have been some single-arm pantographs on Russian railways. Some streetcars use double-arm pantographs, among them the Russian KTM-5, KTM-8, LVS-86 and many other Russian-made trams, as well as some Euro-PCC trams in Belgium. American streetcars use either trolley poles or single-arm pantographs. == Metro systems and overhead lines == Prague tram Most rapid transit systems are powered by a third rail, but some use pantographs, particularly ones that involve extensive above-ground running. Most hybrid metro-tram or 'pre-metro' lines whose routes include tracks on city streets or in other publicly accessible areas, such as line 51 of the Amsterdam Metro, the MBTA Green Line, RTA Rapid Transit in Cleveland, Frankfurt am Main U-Bahn, and San Francisco's Muni Metro, use overhead wire, as a standard third rail would obstruct street traffic and present too great a risk of electrocution. Among the various exceptions are several tram systems, such as the ones in Bordeaux, Angers, Reims and Dubai that use a proprietary underground system developed by Alstom, called APS, which only applies power to segments of track that are completely covered by the tram. This system was originally designed to be used in the historic centre of Bordeaux because an overhead wire system would cause a visual intrusion. Similar systems that avoid overhead lines have been developed by Bombardier, AnsaldoBreda, CAF, and others. These may consist of physical ground-level infrastructure, or use energy stored in battery packs to travel over short distances without overhead wiring. Overhead pantographs are sometimes used as alternatives to third rails because third rails can ice over in certain winter weather conditions. The MBTA Blue Line uses pantograph power for the entire section of its route that runs on the surface, while switching to third rail power before entering the underground portion of its route. The entire metro systems of Sydney, Madrid, Barcelona, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Kobe, Fukuoka, Sendai, Jaipur, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi use overhead wiring and pantographs (as well as certain lines of the metro systems in Beijing, Chongqing, Noida, Hyderabad, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Singapore, Sapporo, Budapest, and Mexico City). Pantographs were also used on the Nord- Sud Company rapid transit lines in Paris until the other operating company of the time, Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris, bought out the company and replaced all overhead wiring with the standard third rail system used on other lines. Numerous railway lines use both third rail and overhead power collection along different portions of their routes, generally for historical reasons. They include the North London line and West London lines of London Overground, the Northern City Line of Great Northern, four of the five lines in the Rotterdam Metro network, Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, and the Chicago Transit Authority's Yellow Line. In this last case, the overhead portion was a remnant of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad's high-speed Skokie Valley Route, and was the only line on the entire Chicago subway system to utilize pantograph collection for any length. As such, the line required railcars that featured pantographs as well as third rail shoes, and since the overhead was a very small portion of the system, only a few cars would be so equipped. The changeover occurred at the grade crossing at East Prairie, the former site of the Crawford-East Prairie station. Here, trains bound for Dempster-Skokie would raise their pantographs, while those bound for Howard would lower theirs, doing so at speed in both instances. In 2005, due to the cost and unique maintenance needs for what only represented a very small portion of the system, the overhead system was removed and replaced with the same third rail power that was used throughout the rest of the system, which allowed all of Chicago's railcars to operate on the line. All the pantographs were removed from the Skokie equipped cars. In 2010, the Oslo Metro line 1 changed from third rail to overhead line power at Fr√∏en station. Due to the many level crossings, it was deemed difficult to install a third rail on the rest of the older line's single track. After 2010 third rails were used in spite of level crossings. The third rails have gaps, but there are two contact shoes. ==Three-phase supply== Experimental three- phase railcar, Germany, 1901 On some systems using three phase power supply, locomotives and power cars have two pantographs with the third-phase circuit provided by the running rails. In 1901 an experimental high-speed installation, another design from Walter Reichel at Siemens & Halske, used three vertically mounted overhead wires with the collectors mounted on horizontally extending pantographs. ==Inclined pantographs== Tilted pantograph used with offset overhead line to allow loading of open wagons On lines where open wagons are loaded from above, the overhead line may be offset to allow this; the pantographs are then mounted at an angle to the vertical. == Weaknesses == Contact between a pantograph and an overhead line is usually assured through a block of graphite. This material conducts electricity while working as a lubricant. As graphite is brittle, pieces can break off during operation. Bad pantographs can seize the overhead wire and tear it down, so there is a two-way influence whereby bad wires can damage the pantograph and bad pantographs can damage the wires. To prevent this, a pantograph monitoring station can be used. At sustained high speeds (above ) friction can cause the contact strip to become red hot, which in turn can cause excessive arcing and eventual failure. In the UK, the pantographs (Brecknell Willis, Stone Faiveley etc.) of vehicles are raised by air pressure, and the graphite contact \\"carbons\\" create an air gallery in the pantograph head which release the air if a graphite strip is lost, activating the automatic drop device and lowering the pantograph to prevent damage. Newer electric traction units may use more sophisticated methods which detect the disturbances caused by arcing at the point of contact when the graphite strips are damaged. There are not always two pantographs on an Electrical Multiple Unit, but in cases where there are the other one can be used if one is damaged; an example of this situation would be a British Rail Class 390. The rear pantograph in relation to the direction of travel is often used as to avoid damaging both pantographs in case of entanglements: if the front pantograph was used, debris from an entanglement could cause damage to the rear pantograph, rendering both pantographs and the vehicle inoperable. == See also == * Bow collector * Current collector * Pantographs and underbody collectors * Railway electrification system * Trolley pole == References == Category:Locomotive parts Category:Tram technology Category:Electric buses ","title":"Pantograph (transport)"},{"id":"1294418","text":"Karl Leonhard Reinhold (26 October 1757 ‚Äì 10 April 1823) was an Austrian philosopher who helped to popularise the work of Immanuel Kant in the late 18th century. His \\"elementary philosophy\\" (Elementarphilosophie) also influenced German idealism, notably Johann Gottlieb Fichte, as a critical system grounded in a fundamental first principle. He was the father of Ernst Christian Gottlieb Reinhold (1793‚Äì1855), also a philosopher. ==Life== Reinhold was born in Vienna. In late 1772, at the age of fourteen he entered the Jesuit college (Roman Catholic seminary) of St. Anne's Church, Vienna (Jesuitenkollegium St. Anna). He studied there for a year, until the order was suppressed in 1773, at which time he joined a similar Viennese Catholic college of the order of St. Barnabas, the Barnabitenkollegium St. Michael. In 1778 he became a teacher at the Barnabitenkollegium, on August 27, 1780, he was ordained as a priest, and on April 30, 1783, he became a member of the Viennese Freemasonry lodge \\"Zur wahren Eintracht.\\"Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Essay on a New Theory of the Human Capacity for Representation, Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. x. Finding himself out of sympathy with monastic life, he fled on November 19, 1783 to Leipzig,Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Vorstellungsverm√∂gens: Teilband 1. Vorrede. Erstes Buch, Meiner Verlag, 2010, p. 166. where he converted to Protestantism. In 1784, after studying philosophy for a semester at Leipzig, he settled in Weimar, where he became Christoph Martin Wieland's collaborator on the German Mercury (Der Teutsche Merkur), and eventually his son-in-law. Reinhold married Wieland's daughter Sophia Catharina Susanna Wieland (October 19, 1768 ‚Äì September 1, 1837) on May 18, 1785. In the German Mercury Reinhold published, in the years 1786‚Äì87, his Briefe √ºber die Kantische Philosophie (Letters on the Kantian Philosophy), which were most important in making Immanuel Kant known to a wider circle of readers. As a result of these Letters, Reinhold received a call to the University of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to 1794. In 1788, Reinhold published Hebr√§ischen Mysterien oder die √§lteste religi√∂se Freymaurerey (The Hebrew Mysteries; or, The Oldest Form of Freemasonry) under the pseudonym Decius. The fundamental idea of this work is that Moses derived his system from the Egyptian priesthood. He presented them in the form of two lectures in Leipzig that year. In 1789 he published his chief work, the Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsverm√∂gens (Essay towards a New Theory of the Faculty of Representation), in which he attempted to simplify the Kantian theory and make it more of a unity by basing it on one principle, Reinhold's principle of consciousness (Satz des Bewu√ütseins). In 1794 he accepted a call to the University of Kiel, where he taught till his death in 1823, although his independent activity had come to an end. In later life he was powerfully influenced by J. G. Fichte, and subsequently by F. H. Jacobi and Christoph Gottfried Bardili. However, his historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier activity. The development of the Kantian standpoint contained in the New Theory of Human Understanding (1789), and in the Fundament des philosophischen Wissens (1791), was called by its author Elementarphilosophie. > Reinhold lays greater emphasis than Kant upon the unity and activity of > consciousness.

The basic Christian doctrines of a transcendent God and an immortal human soul were presuppositions in his thinking. Reinhold tried to show that Kant's philosophy provided an alternative to either religious revelation or philosophical skepticism and fatalistic pantheism. But Kant's Critique of Pure Reason was a difficult and confusing book. It was not widely read and had little influence. Reinhold decided to write his comments on it in the literary journal The German Mercury. He skipped over the beginning and middle of the book and started at the end. Reinhold showed that the book was best read backwards, that is, starting with the end section. The last part of the Critique is where Kant discussed the issues of morality and their relation to the Rational Ideas of God, Free Will, and life after death. These issues were Reinhold's main concern. By presenting these concerns to the public, instead of the extremely difficult epistemology that took up most of the beginning and middle of the book, Reinhold aroused great interest. As a result, Kant's Critique immediately became a book of great importance. According to historian of philosophy Karl Ameriks, \\"Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Schiller, H√∂lderlin, Novalis, and Friedrich Schlegel all developed their thought in reaction to Reinhold's reading of Kant...\\"Karl Ameriks, Reinhold: Letters on the Kantian Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. xl. There is a Faustian tendency in Reinhold's assertion that a person can hope for a future reward only because that person is constantly striving to be good. It is not moral to be good merely in the hope of reward. Reinhold's emphasis on history is evident in his declaration that philosophies and religions are to be judged on the way that they respond to the needs of reason in a particular era. Philosophical development, to him, has an underlying rationality. New philosophies are fated to struggle repeatedly in order to survive in a dialectic of history in which progress is unconsciously occurring. With regard to a transcendent God, the human internal moral law is externalized in such a deity. This extreme otherness or alienation is part of a rational process. It makes possible a subsequent deeper regaining of the self through something other than the self. ===Establishing Kant on secure ground=== Kant's critical philosophy was not being accepted as the final truth. According to Professor George di Giovanni, of McGill University, Reinhold tried to provide a foundation for Kant's philosophy in order to remedy this situation. Reinhold distinguished two levels of philosophy. The most basic level was the concern with consciousness and the representations that occurred in it. The second, less basic, level, was the concern with the possibility and structure of the known or desired objects. Kant's important realization was that the possibility of metaphysics can be established. This can be done only by describing what occurs when the mind is conscious of objects. Kant's weakness was in being overly concerned with the objects themselves. He remained at the second, less basic, level of philosophy. He rarely examined what occurred in consciousness, which is the basic level of philosophy. Kant did not provide a phenomenological description of consciousness. Reinhold was convinced that Kant should have identified the fundamental fact of consciousness that was essential in making cognition itself possible. Reinhold's Essay towards a New Theory of the Human Faculty of Representation is a description of the main parts and attributes of consciousness. In writing this book, Reinhold turned his attention from the moral issues that Kant addressed in the end section of his Critique of Pure Reason to the epistemological concerns of the beginning and middle sections. *General theory of representation **The thing-in-itself necessarily exists, but cannot be known. **Human knowledge is restricted to appearances only. **Reinhold's principle of consciousness ‚Äì The thinking subject distinguishes, in his/her consciousness, the representation or mental image from both the observing subject and the observed object. ***This is a certain fact of consciousness. ***The observing subject is the location of the representation or mental image. ***The observed object is anything that is represented as being present to the mind of the observing subject. Reinhold examined the necessary conditions of representation, such as subject and object, that must exist in order for an object to be consciously present. *Representation's material and form **The representation's material (Stoff) is a given or received manifold of sensation which is unified when it is attributed to a transcendental object. It allows the thinking subject to distinguish a thing- in-itself. **The representation's form is a spontaneous unifying act which occurs according to the subject's conditions. It allows the thinking subject to distinguish a self-in-itself. **The self-in-itself and the thing-in-itself must be assumed in order for the thinking subject to be able to make a distinction between consciousness itself and the object of consciousness. *We can never know anything in itself, that is, as not representation. An object- in-Itself or subject-in-itself does not have matter (sensation) or representational form, so they cannot be known. Only that which is represented can be known *Consciousness must contain representation. **An empirical representation takes its material from a source that is supposed to be external to it. **A pure representation takes its material by reflecting on consciousness **A clear and distinct consciousness of an object is an awareness that consciousness itself is a representation in a subject of an external object. *Special theory of cognition **Cognition is clear, distinct knowledge that consciousness contains a representation of an object. ***Cognition is consciousness's awareness that its own content is a subject's representation of an object. ==Works in English translation== * Essay on a New Theory of the Human Capacity for Representation, Berlin-Boston: Walter de Gruyter, 2011. * Karl Ameriks (ed.), Letters on the Kantian Philosophy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ==See also== * Aenesidemus ==Notes== ==References== * Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Letters on the Kantian Philosophy, edited by Karl Ameriks, translated by James Hebbeler, Cambridge University Press, 1995, * George di Giovanni (ed.), Karl Leonhard Reinhold and the Enlightenment, New York: Springer, 2010, * Dieter Henrich, Between Kant and Hegel: Lectures on German Idealism, translated, with introductions, by George di Giovanni and H.S.

The town has a population of about 17,000 and is also the district administrative centre. It is the birthplace of Oskar Schindler and an important centre of the Czech Esperanto movement, with an Esperanto museum that is part of the town museum. ==History== The town's origins date back to around 1150 when Premonstratensian monks from nearby Litomy≈°l built a church and founded a village at a ford on the river Svitava (\\"pure\\", \\"clear\\"), from which the settlement got its name. Svitavy was first mentioned in 1256 when it was taken over by the bishop of Olomouc, Bruno von Schauenburg. Settlers were then brought in from Germany. In 1330, Svitavy was promoted to the status of a town, and at the end of the 14th century, walls were built around the town with three gates. In the 16th century the town flourished economically as a center of weavers and drapers. During the Hussite, Thirty Years', Napoleonic and Austro-Prussian wars, the town suffered as armies passed through the town. During the Thirty Years' War the town was devastated and in 1781 it burned down by accident. In the 19th century the building of a railway line through Zwittau contributed to the development of the town, especially the textile industry. Svitavy was historically a German-speaking town with a Czech minority; in 1930, 88.4% of the population was German-speaking. In the beginning of the 20th century the town saw tensions between Czech and German speaking people. In October 1938, the town was added to Sudetenland and occupied by the German army. After the end of the World War II in 1945, the German population was expelled as a result of the Bene≈° decrees. The industrialist Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,200 Jews working at his factory during the war, was born in Zwittau. ==Sights== Svitavy has a valuable historical core, which includes the elongated main square with the second longest arcade in the Czech Republic and a collection of architecturally noteworthy civic buildings, several churches, remains of town walls, and baroque statues. Among the most notable buildings in Svitavy are the old town hall and the neighboring building \\"U mou≈ôen√≠na\\" (\\"The Moor\\"), located on the main square. Also of particular interest are the Town Museum and the Ottendorfer House. The oldest church in Svitavy is the Church of St. Giles. There are only a few remains left of the town walls, including a semi-circular bastion. There are a variety of monuments and statues in the town's public spaces. ===Civic buildings=== * Main square - N√°mƒõst√≠ M√≠ru (Peace Square), an elongated square surrounded by baroque and classicist buildings and their arcades, carefully reconstructed in the 2000s. * Old town hall ‚Äì originally a Renaissance building with a tower, extensively rebuilt after the fire of 1781 and again in 1849; it served as the town hall until 1933 (and in addition, it housed the town treasury, a court, a police station, and a jail), now it is used for commercial purposes. The fa√ßade of the building has the town's emblem (the head of a male goat between two towers), on top of the tower there is a Turkish crescent. * \\"The Moor\\" ‚Äì neighboring the old town hall and linked to it by a corridor above the street. The Austrian emperor Joseph II spent a night here in 1776. The tourist information center is now located in the building. * Ottendorfer House ‚Äì a red-brick historicist building with a tower, it is one of the symbols of the town, built in 1892 by the locally born philanthropist, the American journalist Valentin Oswald Ottendorfer on the site of the cottage where his was born. It originally housed the public Ottendorfer Library, until the World War II the largest and most modern German-language library in Moravia (what is left of the collection is now located at the Town Museum and Gallery), later a town cultural center. Since 2008 the Esperanto Museum and a tea room are located on the ground floor, the ornate hall on the floor above continues to serve as a concert hall. * Langer villa (Present town hall) ‚Äì historicist building with rich stucco ornamentation, localed at the edge of Jan Palach Park, built in 1892 by architect Hugo Wanderley, son of Professor Germano Wanderley, designer of the building, who also designed the Ottendorfer House. The house belonged to one of the richest families in Svitavy, local businesspeople. During the Depression, it was rented out to the town treasury, which in turn in 1933 rented the house to the town authorities, who bought the house and transferred the town hall to it. It was extensively renovated in 1989. * Old treasury ‚Äì neoclassical building dating from 1902, located on the main square, in the 1990s the interior was decorated with sculptures by Olbram Zoubek. It currently houses a bank. * Former orphanage and old people's home ‚Äì with elements of the Italian Renaissance, built in 1886 with the financial support of Valentin Oswald Ottendorfer. It currently houses an elementary school. ===Ecclesiastical buildings=== * Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary on the main square ‚Äì originally probably a romanesque structure, built ca. 1250, Gothic and baroque adaptations, with an accessible tower with a panoramic view * Church of St. Giles ‚Äì originally a romanesque basilica from the mid-12th century, three-nave structure, rebuilt in the early baroque period, with valuable baroque internal ornamentation, in the vicinity of the valuable Gothic Roman Catholic parish house * Church of St. Joseph ‚Äì three- nave, two-tower, neo-romanesque basilica built in 1896, originally called the Red Church because of the red bricks out of which it was built * Monastery of the Sisters of Grace of the St. Vincent de Paul order, founded in 1871, served as a hospital, primarily for children, and an old people's home ‚Äì currently the \\"Home at the Crossroads\\", taking care of mentally handicapped women ===Museums, galleries and other cultural institutions=== * Town Museum and Gallery ‚Äì located in a villa, built in 1892 in German Renaissance style, originally belonged to former mayor and businessman Johann Budig. In 1947 the town museum was installed in the confiscated building, later a wing was added on the right side. The first museum collection was established already in 1894 kaj place in the town orphanage. Among the permanent exhibits is the \\"Search for the Star of David\\" ‚Äì a biographical presentation on Oskar Schindler, the Righteous Among Nations, the unique \\"History of Washing Technology\\", the photo exposition \\"History of Svitavy\\" showing photos of the town from the beginning of the 20th century and the \\"Villas of Svitavy\\". In addition, the museum organizes temporary thematic exhibits. At the beginning of June the museum organizes a Museum Night with a rich program and throughout the year organizes lectures, discussions, and other cultural programs. There is a photo exhibit on the life and works of Valentin Oswald Ottendorfer in the corridors of the Ottendorfer House. In addition, a branch of the museum is located on the ground floor of the Ottendorfer House: * Esperanto Museum ‚Äì established in 2008, run by the Czech Esperanto Association.

The theory was originally developed to explain the pattern of the species‚Äìarea relationship occurring in oceanic islands. Under either name it is now used in reference to any ecosystem (present or past) that is isolated due to being surrounded by unlike ecosystems, and has been extended to mountain peaks, seamounts, oases, fragmented forests, and even natural habitats isolated by human land development. The field was started in the 1960s by the ecologists Robert H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, who coined the term island biogeography in their inaugural contribution to Princeton's Monograph in Population Biology series, which attempted to predict the number of species that would exist on a newly created island. == Definitions == For biogeographical purposes, an insular environment or \\"island\\" is any area of habitat suitable for a specific ecosystem, surrounded by an expanse of unsuitable habitat. While this may be a traditional island‚Äîa mass of land surrounded by water‚Äîthe term may also be applied to many nontraditional \\"islands\\", such as the peaks of mountains, isolated springs or lakes, and non-contiguous woodlands. The concept is often applied to natural habitats surrounded by human-altered landscapes, such as expanses of grassland surrounded by highways or housing tracts, and national parks. Additionally, what is an insular for one organism may not be so for others, some organisms located on mountaintops may also be found in the valleys, while others may be restricted to the peaks. == Theory == The theory of insular biogeography proposes that the number of species found in an undisturbed insular environment (\\"island\\") is determined by immigration and extinction. And further, that the isolated populations may follow different evolutionary routes, as shown by Darwin's observation of finches in the Galapagos Islands. Immigration and emigration are affected by the distance of an island from a source of colonists (distance effect). Usually this source is the mainland, but it can also be other islands. Islands that are more isolated are less likely to receive immigrants than islands that are less isolated. The rate of extinction once a species manages to colonize an island is affected by island size; this is the species-area curve or effect. Larger islands contain larger habitat areas and opportunities for more different varieties of habitat. Larger habitat size reduces the probability of extinction due to chance events. Habitat heterogeneity increases the number of species that will be successful after immigration. Over time, the countervailing forces of extinction and immigration result in an equilibrium level of species richness. This diagram shows the effect of an island‚Äôs distance from the mainland on the amount of species richness. The sizes of the two islands are approximately the same. Island 1 receives more random dispersion of organisms, while island number two, since it is farther away, receives less random dispersion of organisms. This diagram shows the effect of an island‚Äôs size on the amount of species richness. The diagram shows two islands equidistant from the mainland. Island 1 receives less random dispersion of organisms. While island 2 receives more of the arrows and therefore more random dispersion of organisms. === Modifications === In addition to having an effect on immigration rates, isolation can also affect extinction rates. Populations on islands that are less isolated are less likely to go extinct because individuals from the source population and other islands can immigrate and \\"rescue\\" the population from extinction; this is known as the rescue effect. In addition to having an effect on extinction, island size can also affect immigration rates. Species may actively target larger islands for their greater number of resources and available niches; or, larger islands may accumulate more species by chance just because they are larger. This is the target effect. === Influencing factors === Total number of reptilian and amphibian species on seven small and large islands in the West Indies * Degree of isolation (distance to nearest neighbour, and mainland) * Length of isolation (time) * Size of island (larger area usually facilitates greater diversity) * The habitat suitability which includes: ** Climate (tropical versus arctic, humid versus arid, variability, etc.) ** Initial plant and animal composition if previously attached to a larger land mass (e.g. marsupials, primates) ** The current species composition * Location relative to ocean currents (influences nutrient, fish, bird, and seed flow patterns) * Location relative to dust blow (influences nutrients) * Serendipity (the impacts of chance arrivals) * Human activity == Historical record == The theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the Carboniferous Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this Carboniferous rainforest collapse event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles. == Research experiments == The theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student Daniel Simberloff in the mangrove islands in the Florida Keys. Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with methyl bromide to clear their arthropod communities. Following fumigation, the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonized to pre-fumigation levels. However, Simberloff and Wilson contended this final species richness was oscillating in quasi-equilibrium. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size. Research conducted at the rainforest research station on Barro Colorado Island has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations. == Applications in conservation biology == Within a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of conservation biology had been realised and was being vigorously debated in ecological circles. The idea that reserves and national parks formed islands inside human-altered landscapes (habitat fragmentation), and that these reserves could lose species as they 'relaxed towards equilibrium' (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal Nature and reported in the New York Times, showed a strong correlation between the size of a protected U.S. National Park and the number of species of mammals. This led to the debate known as single large or several small (SLOSS), described by writer David Quammen in The Song of the Dodo as \\"ecology's own genteel version of trench warfare\\". In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff's papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in reserve design. This view was in particular championed by Jared Diamond. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected. Island biogeography theory also led to the development of wildlife corridors as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity. In species diversity, island biogeography most describes allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering sympatric speciation, the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred. == See also == * Disturbance (ecology) * Island ecology * Mammals of the Caribbean * Patch dynamics * Distance decay * Sky island == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Biogeography Biogeography Category:Landscape ecology ","title":"Insular biogeography"},{"id":"1294455","text":"Flite may refer to: * A small run-time speech synthesis engine used by Festival Speech Synthesis System * A new name for Widgetbox (a San Francisco, California based company that enables businesses to create and deliver applications to their customers) * A quarrel, dispute, wrangling; a scolding: see wiktionary:flite ==See also== *Flight (disambiguation) *Flyte (disambiguation) ","title":"Flite"},{"id":"1294466","text":"Sir Michael Niko Jones (born 8 April 1965) is a New Zealand former rugby union player and coach. He was named by Rugby World magazine as the third best All Black of the 20th century after Colin Meads and Sean Fitzpatrick.\\"The greatest All Blacks of the century\\". Rugby World. January 2000. John Hart, who first selected him for Auckland, called him \\"almost the perfect rugby player\\". ==Early years== Jones was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and grew up in Te Atat≈´ South, a suburb in the west of Auckland, attending Edmonton Primary, Rangeview Intermediate and Henderson High School. His talent for playing was discovered early, as a 10-year-old tackling 15 to 18 year-olds at the weekend kick-abouts at the primary school. He played for the primary school team when still in standard one, when he was three years younger than the other players and by the time he attended Henderson High School, he was already well known locally. He then helped turn a mediocre high school first XV into a successful rugby team that could compete with Auckland Grammar and Kelston Boys High (the regional heavyweights) for the first time. He played for the local Waitemata Rugby Club and it wasn't long before the Auckland representative team (coached by John Hart) took notice.McConnell, Robin (1994). Iceman ‚Äì The Michael Jones Story (1st ed.). Auckland ‚Äì Rugby Press. ==Playing career== Jones played initially as an open side flanker, and made his provincial debut for Auckland aged 20 in the 1985 National Provincial Championship, scoring three tries against South Canterbury. He also played for New Zealand Colts. He made his international debut for Western Samoa, for whom he qualified through his mother, in 1986. After one cap for Samoa, and a British tour with the New Zealand Barbarians in 1987, he first played for New Zealand in the first game of the inaugural World Cup in the same year. He scored the second try of the tournament and played in four games, including the final, as New Zealand went on to win the competition. Jones's career was blighted by injuries, notably two serious knee injuries (in 1989 and 1997) and a broken jaw in 1993. Due to this he only played 55 international games during a period when New Zealand played almost 90 internationals, even though he was usually first choice whenever fit. His international career was also affected by his strong Christian beliefs, as he refused to play on Sundays. Although he was selected for the 1987 and 1991 All Black World Cup squads, he missed three Sunday games in the 1991 tournament due to his religious beliefs. Jones was omitted from the 1995 squad as he would have been unavailable for the quarterfinal and semifinal games. He was once asked how a Christian such as himself could be such an uncompromising tackler. In reply he quoted a phrase from the Bible: is better to give than receive. Jones was a member of the successful Auckland and Auckland Blues teams which dominated New Zealand rugby in the late 1980s and 1990s. Between 1985 and 1999 Auckland won 9 NPC titles, 5 Super 6 championships, and defended the Ranfurly Shield a record 61 consecutive times (between 1985 and 1993), while the Blues won the first two Super 12 competitions in 1996 and 1997. In 1997 he succeeded Zinzan Brooke as captain of Auckland and the Blues. He was an outstanding openside flanker, and scored 13 international tries. Later in his career, and after his injuries had reduced the speed which characterised his early career, he played predominantly as a blindside flanker or number eight. In 1998 he was dropped from the New Zealand team at the age of 33 after a loss over Australia and retired at the end of the 1999 season. ==Coaching career== On 7 April 2004 Jones was appointed national coach of Samoa, replacing New Zealander John Boe. He had previously served as Boe's assistant coach during the 2003 World Cup. In 2007, just after the players flew out to New Zealand to prepare for their tour of South Africa, there was speculation that Jones had resigned as coach. However, after talks with the Manu Samoa Union over whether his role should become full-time until the World Cup, Jones joined the team on tour. ==Personal life== Jones graduated from the University of Auckland with three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Bachelor of Planning. Jones and his wife Maliena have three children. He is the uncle of actor KJ Apa. ==Honours and awards== A role model, particularly for Pacific Islander youth in New Zealand, Jones was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, for service to the Pacific Island community. In the 1997 New Year Honours, Jones was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby. In 2003, he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He was promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to the Pacific community and youth. Jones has been given the matai title (Samoan chiefly title) of La'auli and Savae from his ‚Äòaiga (extended family). ==References== ==External links== * *Waitemata Rugby Club Category:1965 births Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand rugby union coaches Category:New Zealand people of Samoan descent Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:Samoa international rugby union players Category:World Rugby Hall of Fame inductees Category:Auckland rugby union players Category:Blues (Super Rugby) players Category:Rugby union flankers Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Rugby union players from Auckland Category:Knights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:Living people Category:People educated at Henderson High School, Auckland Category:Rugby players and officials awarded knighthoods Category:New Zealand Christians ","title":"Michael Jones (rugby union)"},{"id":"1294494","text":"Red chalk can refer to: * Sanguine for the material used for drawing * Hunstanton Formation for the now obsolete stratigraphic term 'Red Chalk' employed in the geology of eastern England.

His best known roles include Jack Abbott on The Young and the Restless, Mason Capwell on Santa Barbara and Royce Keller on As the World Turns. == Early life and education == Lester was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated from Southport High School and began an acting career while at DePauw University. == Career == He starred in the 1976 children's series Ark II, followed by roles in Airport 1975 and the 1978 Kiss movie Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park. Lester's big break came when he joined CBS daytime soap The Young and the Restless in 1980. He originated the role of Jack Abbott, a scoundrel who never met a woman (including his own father's wife) he didn't want to take to bed. Lester was so popular that The Young and the Restless creator William J. Bell wrote an entire family for him. The series was going through a transition period which many fans believed his star quality helped the show build more viewership rising to #1 in daytime soap ratings. In spite of his popularity, by the end of the decade Lester felt his role on the show was steadily declining. In 1989 he not only quit but took the rare step of going to the daytime press and singling out Bill Bell's young daughter, Lauralee Bell (who plays ingenue Christine Blair), for his dwindling role. He felt the excess airtime given to her came at the expense of both himself and other actors. Lester was replaced by Peter Bergman, who has played the part of Jack ever since. Lester switched to NBC to take over the role of Mason Capwell on Santa Barbara for a year. In November 1992, he joined As the World Turns to play the charming Royce Keller, who was soon revealed to be suffering from multiple personalities which caused him to kill his own sister in the series. The role was complex, causing raves for Lester, but the headwriter behind the story, Douglas Marland, died suddenly in 1993, and Lester once again found his screentime diminishing. He left the series on May 5, 1994. The remainder of his professional life consisted of appearances in primetime shows such as Walker, Texas Ranger and Star Trek: Voyager along with various tours in musicals and plays. == Death == On November 28, 2003, Lester died of a heart attack at the age of 53. ==Filmography== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Roles in television and film - ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Role ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes -  1975  Airport 1975  Mr. Kelly  Film; uncredited -  1975  Barbary Coast  Bret Hollister  Episode: \\"The Barbary Coast\\" -  1976  Ark II  Jonah  Main role -  1978  Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park  Sam  Television film -  1978  Flying High  Billy Bob  Episode: \\"Swan Song for an Ugly Duckling\\" -  1979  Eight Is Enough  Reed Ellis  Episode: \\"The Cupid Crisis\\" -  1979  Dallas  Rudy Millington  Episode: \\"Return Engagement\\" -  1980  Once Upon a Spy  Rudy  Television film -  1980‚Äì1989  The Young and the Restless  Jack Abbott  Regular role -  1985  Blade in Hong Kong  Joe Blade  Television film -  1985  Hotel  Chad Wheeler  Episode: \\"Echoes\\" -  1987  In Self Defense  Dan Edwards  Television film -  1989‚Äì1990  Santa Barbara  Mason Capwell  Regular role -  1991‚Äì1994  As The World Turns  Royce Keller  Recurring role -  1995  Star Trek: Voyager  Haron  Episode: \\"Maneuvers\\" -  1997  JAG  Chief Petty Officer Fred Holst  Episode: \\"Rendezvous\\" -  1997  Diagnosis: Murder  Jeffrey Porter  Episode: \\"Open and Shut\\" -  1999  Walker, Texas Ranger  Earl McMartin  Episode: \\"Power Angels\\" - } == References == == External links == * * * Category:1950 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American male soap opera actors Category:Place of death missing Category:American male television actors Category:DePauw University alumni Category:Gay actors Category:Male actors from Indianapolis Category:LGBT entertainers from the United States Category:20th-century American male actors ","title":"Terry Lester"},{"id":"1294563","text":"Bi-Mart is an employee-owned chain of retailers located in the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

Bi-Mart's first store opened in Yakima, Washington in 1955, but it did not open a second store until 1962. In 1976, Bi-Mart was bought by Pay 'n Save, which itself was acquired by Thrifty Corporation in 1984. It was subsequently merged into the former Kmart subsidiary PayLess Drug, and finally purchased by Rite Aid in 1996. In 1997, Bi-Mart's management and Endeavour Capital (a Portland-based venture capital firm) bought the company; they sold it to employees March 1, 2004, for $94 million, which included $12.5 million contributed from the 401(k) plan. Bi-Mart is the sole surviving store name of former Pay 'n Save subsidiaries. (Schucks Auto Supply retained its name until acquired by O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and rebranded in 2010.) In October 2003, Bi-Mart announced it was expanding eastward. Eight stores were planned with the first store in Havre, Montana. The second store opened three years later in Weiser, Idaho. In 2006, Bi-Mart exited the Montana market due to poor sales. ==Pharmacy Closures== In 2019, Bi-Mart announced the closure of pharmacies at their East Wenatchee, Washington location, two locations in Vancouver, Washington, and their location in Scappoose, Oregon. Bi-Mart announced in November, 2019 that it will also close pharmacies at an additional 13 stores in the Portland area. https://www.kptv.com/news/bi-mart- ending-pharmacy-services-at-stores-around-portland- area/article_07f37dbc-0269-11ea-a3f6-575e5c40de2c.html The stores affected by the pharmacy closures will remain open. ==Cascade Farm and Outdoor== In 2014, Bi-Mart opened its first location under the Cascade Farm and Outdoor name in Walla Walla, Washington. Bi-Mart announced that they were looking at empty buildings in a variety of locations for future stores. Additional locations have since opened in Coos Bay, Oregon and Keizer, Oregon. Unlike Bi-Mart's regular stores, a membership is not required at Cascade Farm and Outdoor. ==References== == External links == * *Smaller and steady win the race, a December 2004 article from The Oregonian Category:Companies based in Eugene, Oregon Category:Retail companies established in 1955 Category:Discount stores of the United States Category:Economy of the Northwestern United States Category:Employee-owned companies of the United States Category:Pay 'n Save Category:1955 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Bi-Mart"},{"id":"1294565","text":"Louis E.

The serial is set more than ten thousand years in the future. In the serial, the insectoid aliens the Wirrn intend to absorb the humans along with their knowledge on board Space Station Nerva. ==Plot== The TARDIS materialises on an aged space station. Sarah is overcome by lack of oxygen. While Harry and the Fourth Doctor explore, Sarah is transported away and placed into cryonic suspension by the station computer. Harry and the Doctor explore and realise the station is a kind of ark. Discovering Sarah, Harry searches for a resuscitation unit but discovers a mummified alien insect instead. A woman called Vira revives from suspended animation. Vira revives both Sarah and Noah, Space Station Nerva's leader. The Doctor tells Vira that Nerva's inhabitants have overslept by several millennia, thanks to the insect visitor that sabotaged the control systems. Noah and the visitors clash, and Noah accuses them of murdering a missing crewmate. Noah investigates the power room and is infected by an alien creature. The Doctor realises the alien insect laid eggs inside the missing crewman, who became an alien now inhabiting Nerva. Noah kills a crewmate, but recovers enough to order Vira to revive the remaining crew and evacuate, but the Doctor realises the alien pupae will mature too quickly for this. He proposes that they destroy the Wirrn while they are in their dormant, pupal stage. Dissection of the Wirrn corpse reveals the Wirrn are vulnerable to electricity. As he tries to reactivate the station power, the fully transformed Noah attacks him. Noah reveals that the Wirrn were driven from their home by human settlers and now intend to absorb all human knowledge. The Doctor plans to electrify the cryogenic chamber to prevent the Wirrn from attacking more of the human crew. Because the Wirrn have disabled the station's power supply, the crew decide to use the generators on board a transport ship docked at the space station. Sarah volunteers to crawl through a narrow conduit carrying the power cable from the ship, and the Doctor succeeds in electrifying the cryogenic chamber. Set back, Noah, as the Swarm Leader, offers the others safe passage from Nerva if they leave the sleeping crew for the Wirrn, but the crew declines. Noah leads the entire swarm in an assault on the transport ship. Vira and the rest of the crew escape the transport ship after setting the autopilot. The transport blasts off carrying the entire swarm away from the station. The Doctor wonders whether this was Noah's plan all along, to save Nerva, and that there was some spark of humanity left in him. Noah transmits one final good-bye to Vira before the transport explodes with the entire Wirrn swarm on board. In the closing sequence, the TARDIS party teleport down to Earth to repair the receiver terminal and allow the ark colonists to repopulate the Earth. ==Production== The script, written by Robert Holmes, is from a story by John Lucarotti, which was rewritten because it was considered unusable. Holmes rewrote The Ark in Space as a four-part serial as a lead-in to the two part The Sontaran Experiment. Lucarotti does not receive any on-screen credit. Barry Letts had planned the story, originally called Space Station, before Philip Hinchcliffe took over as producer. Letts had also planned to produce the four-part serial alongside the two-part Sontaran Experiment, so it was treated as a single six- part story to save money; The Ark in Space was filmed entirely in-studio, while The Sontaran Experiment was filmed entirely on location. The Ark in Space is the first broadcast story from Hinchcliffe as producer. Hinchcliffe believed that in order to expand the show's core audience, it was necessary to broaden the show's appeal to adults, and Ark in Space demonstrates this with its use of horror, particularly the inexorable transformation of Noah into an alien creature. A scene in which the half-transformed Noah begs Vira to kill him was deemed too scary for children and had to be cut. The title sequence for Part One was tinted green as an experiment, but was not repeated for subsequent episodes. The title sequence would stay constant for the next six years. The Ark in Space was recorded in-studio in October and November 1974. The sets for this story were re-used for Revenge of the Cybermen, partially set on Space Station Nerva at an earlier time. ==Broadcast and reception== Part Two of this story charted at number five for the most-watched television programmes across the week on all channels. This was the highest chart placing ever attained by a single episode of Doctor Who until 2007's \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" placed second for both that week and the entire year. The highest rated episode (in terms of viewing audience) is Part Four of City of Death. The story was edited and condensed into a single omnibus edition, broadcast at 6:35 pm on 20 August 1975 and reached 8.2 million viewers. The compilation was included on the Special Edition DVD release of the story. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a favourable review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writing, \\"The Ark in Space rises above the dodginess of the effects by treating its themes so seriously it's a possible influence on Alien\\". (a view echoed by Steven Moffat, prior to the broadcast of the 2014 Doctor Who Christmas Special, replying to a question on borrowing material from the Alien films, he countered with \\"They never asked Doctor Who to borrow the plot of the Ark in Space\\"). In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the story \\"contains some of the most horrific material to have been featured in the series up to this point\\". They praised the set design and the dramatic tension, as well as the effects of the Wirrn. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was positive towards the series' turn towards horror, writing that the poor effects were successful in conveying what they intended. Mulkern also praised the cast. DVD Talk's J Doyle Wallis gave the serial three and a half out of five stars, calling it \\"a neat little slice of science fiction adventure\\". Reviewing the 2013 rerelease for the same site, Ian Jane gave it four stars, saying that it was \\"a lot of fun\\" despite the production values being a \\"mixed bag\\". Will Salmon of SFX rated the serial four and a half out of five stars, calling it \\"brimming with confidence\\". Salmon wrote that the concept of the Wirrn were so terrifying that the poor effects did not matter. The Ark in Space is considered to have drawn explicitly on the Biblical story of Noah's Ark In an analysis of apocalyptic themes in Doctor Who, academic Andrew Crome highlighted the explicit religious influences on the writing of The Ark in Space. He considered the eponymous Ark to be an analogue of the Biblical story of Noah's Ark, the ancient flood myth related in the Book of Genesis, and that the naming of the Nerva Beacon commander as Noah was an overtly Biblical allusion. Crome also drew parallels between the commandment given by God to Man in ‚Äî \\"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth\\" ‚Äî and the High Minister's rousing speech to the humans awakening from cyogenic sleep on Nerva Beacon: According to Crome, the catastrophe of solar flares burning the Earth was represented in the Ark in Space as a purifying event which led to the renewal of human society, drawing heavily on the Genesis flood narrative. At Inside the World of Doctor Who, a live event hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts on 29 November 2008, Russell T Davies, producer of the 21st century revival of Doctor Who, said that The Ark in Space was his favourite story from the original run of Doctor Who as did Steven Moffat. The Ark in Space was placed in 28th position in Doctor Who Magazine's Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who serial to that point in order of preference. ==Commercial releases== ===In print=== A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published by Target Books in 1977. It was subsequently reprinted by Virgin Publishing in 1991 with a new cover. BBC Books also reprinted the book in 2012 in an edition featuring an introduction by Steven Moffat.https://www.gamesradar.com/doctor-who-6-more-glorious- classic-target-books-reprints/ This was Marter's first novelisation for Target; he would go on to write seven more. Marter had wanted to correct some logical problems he had found in the story. He considered writing in first person from Harry's point of view, but abandoned this when he realised that many important plot points took place when Harry was not present. Notably, Marter changed the spelling of \\"Wirrn\\" to \\"Wirrrn\\". Marter alters the ending so that the travellers leave in the TARDIS. ===Home media=== The Ark in Space was first released on VHS in 1989 in an omnibus format. It was then re- released in 1994 in its original episodic format (but the 1999 US release is still in omnibus format). It was released on Laserdisc in 1996 in its original episodic format. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2002. It was released for sale on iTunes on 11 August 2008. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 90 on 13 June 2012. The Ark in Space was released as a special edition DVD on 25 February 2013. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * ===Target novelisation=== * Category:Doctor Who serials novelised by Ian Marter Category:Fourth Doctor serials Category:1975 British television episodes Category:Fiction set in the 11th millennium or beyond Category:Television episodes set in space ","title":"The Ark in Space"},{"id":"1294615","text":"Prince Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin (December 22, 1770 ‚Äì May 6, 1840) was an emigre Russian aristocrat and Catholic priest known as The Apostle of the Alleghenies. Since 2005, he has been under consideration for possible canonization by the Catholic Church. His current title is Servant of God. ==Early life== Prince Dimitri Dmitrievich Gallitzin was born on December 22, 1770 at The Hague. His father, Prince Dimitri Alexeievich, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, was an intimate friend of Voltaire and a follower of Diderot. His mother was the Prussian Countess Adelheid Amalie von Schmettau, the daughter of Field Marshall Samuel von Schmettau.Brownson, Sarah. Life of Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, Prince and Priest, Fr Pustet & Co., New York, 1873 When Prince Demitri was about two years old the Empress Catherine the Great visited The Hague, and as a sign of special favor to his father, cradled the child in her arms, and appointed the boy an officer of the guard. He was raised as a nominal member of the Russian Orthodox Church, although his father, like many Russian aristocrats of his age, had little connection to or fondness for religion. As was fashionable at the time, the language of the household was French, which was Prince Dmitri's native tongue. In his youth his most constant companion was William Frederick, son of William V, then reigning Stadtholder of the Netherlands. This friendship continued even after William became King of the Netherlands and Duke of Luxemburg as William I.Kittell, Ferdinand. \\"Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 Aug. 2014 Each summer, his mother would take Dimitri and his sister traveling to the principal cities of Germany, explaining to them important geographical or historical features. Demetri was, by nature, rather reserved and timid. His sister made friends more readily, but Dimitri kept them longer. After his mother's return to Catholicism in 1786, he was greatly influenced by her circle of intellectuals, priests, and aristocrats. At the age of 17, Prince Dimitri was formally received into the Catholic Church. To please his mother, whose birth (1748), and marriage (1768), occurred on 28 August, the feast of Saint Augustine, he assumed at confirmation that name, and thereafter wrote his name Demetrius Augustine. A cousin, Elizabeth Gallitzin, would also eventually convert and join the Society of the Sacred Heart, founding a number of religious houses in the United States. His father, who had been planning a military career for him, was quite unhappy with the change and was barely dissuaded from sending his son to Saint Petersburg, where he hoped a stint in a Russian Guards Regiment would force his son back into Orthodoxy. In 1792, his son was appointed aide-de-camp to General von Lillien, the commander of the Austrian troops in the Duchy of Brabant;\\"Servant of God, Demetrius Gallitzin\\" but, after the death of Leopold II of Austria and the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden, Prince Dimitri, like all other foreigners, was dismissed from Austrian Service. ==America== As was the custom among young aristocrats at the time, he then set out to complete his education by travel. As the French Revolution had made European tours unsafe, his parents resolved that he should spend two years in traveling through America, the West Indies, and other foreign lands. His mother provided him with letters of introduction from the prince-bishops of Hildesheim and Paderborn to Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore, and with his tutor, Father Brosius, afterwards a prominent missionary in the United States, he embarked from Rotterdam on August 18, 1792 and landed in Baltimore, October 28. To avoid the inconvenience and expense of travelling as a Russian prince, he assumed the name of Augustine Schmettau. This name then became Schmet or Smith, and he was known as Augustine Smith for many years after. Conewago Chapel, Adams Co. PA Not long after his arrival, he became interested in the needs of the Church in the United States.Balliet, Kathleen E., \\"Gallitzin, Father Demetrius Augustine\\", Pennsylvania State University, Fall 2005 To the shock and horror of his father, Prince Dimitri decided to join the priesthood and offered to forgo his inheritance. The Ambassador subsequently persuaded Catherine the Great to award his son a commission in one of the Palace Guards Regiments, and formally summoned him to active duty in St. Petersburg. Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin entered the newly established Seminary of St. Sulpice in Baltimore on November 5, 1792. Father Gallitzin was ordained on March 18, 1795, by Archbishop Carroll. Gallitzin was the first to make all his theological studies in the United States.Hennessey, James J., American Catholics : A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States, Oxford University Press, 1981 Gallitzin then was sent to work in a church mission at Port Tobacco, Maryland, whence he was soon transferred to the Conewago district where he served at Conewago Chapel until 1799. Note: This includes His missionary territory extended from Taneytown, Maryland to Martinsburg, then in Virginia, and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Kerney, Martin Joseph. \\"Reverend Demetri Augustine Gallitzin\\", The Metropolitan, Vol.IV, No. 4, p. 201, May 1856 In 1794, Gallitzin traveled to Middleway, WV, near Martinsburg to accompany Father Dennis Cahill in the investigation of an apparently haunted house, known locally as the Wizard Clip. Gallitzin wrote of this experience much later, around 1839. Heyden, Thomas. A Memoir on the Life and Character of the Rev. Prince Demetrius A. de Gallitzin: Founder of Loretto and Catholicity, in Cambria County, Pa., Apostle of the Alleghanies, p. 122, J. Murphy & Company, 1869 ==Missionary== Stained- glass depiction of Father Demetrius Gallitzin and Father Peter Helbron, St. Patrick Church, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania In the Allegheny Mountains, in 1799, Gallitzin founded the settlement of Loretto, Pennsylvania in what is now Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Loretto in turn was an expansion upon a small clearing, \\"the McGuire Settlement\\", established by Captain Michael McGuire in 1788. McGuire, who died in 1793, bequeathed 400 acres in trust to Bishop Carroll for the eventual establishment of a full Catholic community with resident clergy.\\"Who was Servant of God Demetrius Gallitzin\\", The Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown Gallitzin's military training had taught him engineering fundamentals, and in 1816 he marked out Loretto on the southern slope of a pleasant hillside. He named the town after the place of Marian devotion in Italy.Tobin, Thomas J., \\"The Pastoral Courage of Demetrius Gallitzin\\" With Gallitzin in the lead, Loretto became the first English-speaking Catholic settlement in the United States west of the Allegheny Front. Gallitzin dedicated Loretto's parish church to the honor of St. Michael the Archangel, both as a nod to Gallitzin's Russian roots and, indirectly, to Michael McGuire. For several years St. Michael's Church was the only Catholic Church between Lancaster, Pennsylvania and St. Louis, Missouri. The church today is known as the Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel.\\"Prince's Tour\\", The Basilica of Saint Michael the Archangel In 1802, Gallitzin became a naturalized citizen of the United States under the name Augustine Smith. Seven years after he was naturalized and became a citizen of the United States, an Act passed by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania authorized him to establish his name, Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, and to enjoy all of the benefits accruing to him under the name Augustine Smith. ==In the Alleghenies== It was a 150-mile sick-call that first brought Father Gallitzin to \\"the McGuire settlement.\\" After he was established in Loretto, if a sick-call was within a few miles of wherever he was staying, he travelled on foot. The last four years of his life he travelled by sled because a fall prevented him from riding horseback. When Gallitzin first started, there were few families, and those were widely scattered. He bought land to attract other Catholic settlers.Richardson, Hester Dorsey. \\"Prince Gallitzin, Priest and Pioneer\\", Lippincott's Magazine, Vol. XLIX, January - June 1892. p. 235, J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, 1892 Gallitzin is believed to have spent $150,000 (USD) of his own funds, to purchase some additional 20,000 acres (81 km¬≤), which he gave or sold at low prices to newly arriving Catholic settlers. Travelling from one valley to the next, he was often away for over a week, sleeping on bare floors. For most of his time in the mountains, he worked alone and was relatively isolated. In September 1807, he wrote to Bishop Carroll: > ... I am hardly recovered from a severe spell of sickness which attacked me > in Greensburgh, and which has left me so weak I can scarcely crawl about, > ... My constitution being weak, and my heart perhaps too susceptible of deep > impressions from disappointments, losses, &c.;, I have been wonderfully low > this great while, ... I can better feel than describe the gloomy and > melancholy state of my mind, especially since the death of my mother. ...my > own solitary situation in the wilderness of the Allegheny, my sufferings and > persecutions here, conspire to overwhelm me with sorrow and melancholy. ... > for God's sake send me a companion, a priest, to help and assist me, -a > friend to help me bear the burden. ==Lost inheritance== Over the years, Gallitzin had received some money from his mother, Princess Gallitzin. From time to time he borrowed against his expected inheritance. Upon his father's death, Father Gallitzin, as a Catholic priest, was not allowed, according to Russian law, to receive the inheritance from his father. His representatives in Europe assured him this was not an insurmountable problem, and his sister Maria Anna had pledged to see that he received his share. However, circumstances changed when her subsequent marriage to an insolvent German prince absorbed most of the estate, although he did receive periodic remittances from her. William I of the Netherlands was persuaded to purchase some valuable items from Princess Gallitzin's estate with the understanding that the proceeds were to be sent to his old friend. However the funds were delivered to Gallitzin's brother-in-law, and he saw little of it. His sister bequeathed him an annual stipend, but he saw little of that either. Gallitzin was often encouraged to return to Europe to claim his rights, but as he was reluctant to abandon his flock, he left the matter in the hands of his representatives, who were sometimes less than assiduous. He soon found himself deeply in debt. Besides land, he had provided his parishioners with a grist mill and sawmill to help the community prosper. He obtained a loan from Charles Carroll. Cardinal Cappellari, afterwards Pope Gregory XVI, donated two hundred dollars. The Russian ambassador to the United States loaned him $5,000, and then used the promissory note to light his cigar. Later, when Gallitzin was suggested for the see of Philadelphia in 1814, Bishop Carroll objected. Carroll agreed that Gallitzin's debts had been contracted for excellent and charitable purposes, but it was not clear Gallitzin had the financial acumen to run a diocese as important as Philadelphia, Carroll believed. In 1815, Gallitzin was suggested for the bishopric of Bardstown, Kentucky, and in 1827 for the proposed see of Pittsburgh. Gallitzin resisted proposals to nominate him first bishop of Cincinnati, and first bishop of Detroit, but he did accept appointment as Vicar-General for Western Pennsylvania. By the end of his life, he had eradicated the debts incurred in building the community. ==Writings== Notwithstanding his various duties, Father Gallitzin found time to publish several tracts in defense of Catholicism. He was provoked to respond to a sermon delivered on Thanksgiving Day 1814, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, by a certain minister who went out of his way to attack what he called \\"popery\\". Father Gallitzin first published his Defense of Catholic Principles, which ran through several editions. This was followed by A Letter on the Holy Scriptures and An Appeal to the Protestant Public.Gallitzin, Demetrius A., A defence of Catholic principles in a letter to a Protestant clergyman: to which is added, \\"An appeal to the Protestant public\\", The Catholic Publication Society, New York, 1880Gallitzin, Demetrius A., A letter to a Protestant friend on the Holy Scriptures : being a continuation of the \\"Defense of Catholic principles\\", Christian Press Association Publishing Company, New York ===Quotes=== > Whatever differences on points of doctrine may exist amongst the different > denominations of Christians, all should be united in the bonds of charity, > all should pray for one another, all should be willing to assist one > another; and, where we are compelled to disapprove of our neighbor's > doctrine, let our disapprobation fall upon his doctrine only, not upon his > person.Bunson, Michael. \\"Apostle of the Alleghenies: Reverend Demetrius > Augustine Gallitzin\\" (Johnstown: Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown), 2001 ==Death== Dimitrius Gallitzin marker For 41 years, Gallitzin traveled the Allegheny Mountains, often in very difficult conditions, preaching, teaching, serving, praying and offering the sacraments. A doctor had recommended bedrest and warmth for the exhausted priest, but he was reluctant to curtail any of the Lenten or Holy Week services. Father Gallitzin ministered faithfully until the very end of his life, and after a brief illness, died at Loretto on May 6, 1840, shortly after Easter. He was buried near St. Michael's church in Loretto. ==Legacy== Grave on the property of the Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel in Loretto Gallitzin's part in building up the Catholic church in western Pennsylvania cannot be overestimated; it is said that at his death there were 10,000 Catholics in the district where forty years before he had found a scant dozen. Loretto today is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown. In 1899-1901, the steel industrialist Charles M. Schwab funded the construction of a large stone church, which is the current basilica, at Prince Gallitzin's tomb. Schwab also provided funds for a bronze statue of Gallitzin. The nearby town of Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, is named for western Pennsylvania's first English-speaking Catholic priest. It is in this town that the Pennsylvania Railroad would tunnel through the summit of the Allegheny Mountains. Eventually, the railroad would operate three tunnels through the ridge into Gallitzin. The Gallitzin Tunnel was closed as part of Conrail's massive double-stack clearance project in the 1990s. In the mid-1960s, Pennsylvania christened a new nearby state park in honor of Prince Gallitzin, as he is called locally.\\"Prince Gallitzin State Park\\", Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources In 1990, the Most Rev. Joseph V. Adamec, Bishop-Emeritus of the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, established the Prince Gallitzin Cross Award, which is given annually to Catholics in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown who exemplify the evangelizing spirit of the Prince-Priest, Demetrius Gallitzin.\\"Prince Gallitzin Cross\\", The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Altoona-Johnstown On June 6, 2005, it was announced that Gallitzin had been named a Servant of God by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the first step on the path toward possible future sainthood. ==Notes== ==References== *Brownson, Sarah.

In 1963, Sullivan ran for Governor of Mississippi and lost to eventual winner, Lt. Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr. Sullivan was a staunch segregationist and modeled his campaign on defending racial segregation in Mississippi as it came under attack by the federal government and local civil rights activists. Sullivan won statewide political office during a hard-fought campaign during the 1967 elections. As Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr., running for his old spot as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, campaigned for law and order, Sullivan and eventual Governor-elect John Bell Williams emphasized their ability to roll back required federal changes to the state's segregation policy as outlined by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite thousands of blacks newly registered to vote in Mississippi, the two segregationist candidates for the executive office, Williams and Sullivan, claimed overwhelming victories. In the next four years of Sullivan's term, he and Williams attempted to mollify whites' angst in response to the school desegregation orders (often called \\"immediate integration\\") as ordered by the Federal judiciary in Alexander v.

It has dramatically affected the country's domestic and foreign policy, changing Ukraine's orientation at the time from Russia to the West and damaging Kuchma's career. The scandal started on 28 November 2000, in Kyiv, when Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz publicly accused President Kuchma of involvement in the abduction of journalist Georgiy Gongadze and numerous other crimes. Moroz named Kuchma's former bodyguard, Major Mykola Melnychenko, as the source. He also played selected recordings of the President's secret conversations for journalists, supposedly confirming Kuchma's order to kidnap Gongadze. That and hundreds of other conversations were later published worldwide by Melnychenko. Journalists nicknamed the case after the compact audio cassette used by Moroz. Melnychenko himself was supposedly using digital equipment, not cassettes, for recording in the President's office. ==Consequences== Georgiy Gongadze, journalist, founder of a popular Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, who was kidnapped and murdered in 2000. The described events provoked a crisis, with mass protests in Kyiv from 15 December 2000 to 9 March 2001. Opposition started a campaign of non-violent resistance called UBK (\\"Ukraine without Kuchma!\\"), demanding Kuchma's resignation. Despite economic growth in the country, President Kuchma's public approval ratings fell below 9%. In 2002, the governments of United States and other countries became more deeply involved after one of the recordings revealed the alleged transfer of a sophisticated Ukrainian defence system \\"Kol'chuha\\" to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. As a result, Leonid Kuchma was boycotted by Western governments for a time. In particular, he experienced an offensive diplomatic d√©marche when visiting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit that took place on 21‚Äì22 November 2002 in Prague. Breaking the decades-lasting tradition, the list of participating countries was announced in French, not English. As a result Turkey was named after Ukraine, instead of the United Kingdom and United States, thereby avoiding the appearance of Kuchma next to Tony Blair and George W. Bush. Moreover, widely publicized conversations depicted Kuchma as a rude and spiteful person, using bad language and speaking an unusual mixture of Russian and Ukrainian languages. Advocates argue that excessive foul language is the proof of a deliberate montage of the recordings using extrinsic audio samples. However, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Carlos Pascual, revealed that the tapes are genuine, undistorted, unaltered, and not manipulated because of the conclusion from FBI Electronic Research Facility's analysis of the original recording device and the original recording found that there are not unusual sounds which would indicate a tampering of the recording, the recording is continuous with no breaks, and there is no manipulation of the digital files. Influenced by all above-mentioned, the President soon became disillusioned with European integration and started to loosen Ukraine's relations with the United States and European Union, critical to his regime. Instead, he boosted integration with Russia, considering the fact that its new leader, Vladimir Putin, was continuously supporting Kuchma and refusing to recognize the allegations. In September 2003, Ukrainian troops joined U.S.-led stabilization forces in Iraq, which is widely perceived as Kuchma's effort to improve relations with the West. Since then, high-level relations were partially restored. Commenting on the scandal and Mel'nychenko's actions in particular, Leonid Kuchma persistently claims they were a result of foreign interference, but never accuses any specific country. However, some of his statements on the issue may be interpreted as cautious hints on the role of either United States or Russia. According to him his voice was indeed one of those on the tapes, but he claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004 (Europa Publications), Routledge, December 12, 2003, (page 504) ==Legacy== Many figures of the scandal remained influential in Ukrainian politics. The case was directly connected with the political career of Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's Prime Minister at the time and also Ukraine's former President. Oleksander Moroz concluded an alliance with Yushchenko, resulting in the reformation of Ukraine's constitution (in favor of the parliament). Hundreds of politicians and activists taking part in the 2001 protests led the 2004 Orange Revolution. Yushchenko led the revolution after the presidential election, and became President on 23 January 2005. Mykola Mel'nychenko (who received U.S. political asylum) released new portions of his recordings. In 2004, Volodymyr Tsvil', a Ukrainian businessman who assisted Mel'nychenko in his escape, publicly accused him of not revealing certain details of the case and trying to sell the audio archive to Kuchma's aides. Mel'nychenko visited Ukraine in 2005 to release new allegation details, but hasn't disclosed any details of his possible eavesdropping operation. The criminal investigation regarding the circumstances of Mel'nychenko's records and Georgiy Gongadze's death remains inconclusive despite a mass of information revealed by numerous journalistic investigations. Mel'nychenko's recordings were declared evidence when former President Kuchma was charged with abuse of office and giving illegal orders to Interior Ministry officials; a criminal case into the murder of Gongadze was opened against Kuchma on March 21, 2011.Marchuk says he had no face-to-face interrogations with Kuchma or Melnychenko, Kyiv Post (April 1, 2011) A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient.Court clears Kuchma of Gongadze murder charges, Kyiv Post (14 December 2011) The court rejected Mel'nychenko's recordings as evidence.Court rejects Melnychenko's tapes as evidence in Gongadze case, Kyiv Post (14 December 2011) ==See also== *Myroslava Gongadze, widow of Georgiy Gongadze. *Orange Revolution *Ukrayinska Pravda, newspaper founded by Gongadze *Mykola Mel'nychenko, bodyguard of the former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. *Politics of Ukraine *History of Ukraine ==References== *slate.com - Article on Gongadze scandal *REQUIEM'2002 - Article by Reporters Sans Fronti√®res *Guardian Unlimited - Kuchmagate Category:2000 in Ukraine Category:History of Ukraine since 1991 Category:Political scandals in Ukraine Category:Ukrayinska Pravda Category:2000 scandals ","title":"Cassette Scandal"},{"id":"1294630","text":"Chris Harris may refer to: ==Sportspeople== * Chris Harris (basketball) (born 1933), English basketballer * Chris Harris (cricketer) (born 1969), New Zealand cricketer * Chris Harris (darts player), Welsh darts player * Chris Harris (rower) (born 1985), New Zealand rower * Chris Harris (rugby union) (born 1990), English born, Scottish rugby union player * Chris Harris (safety) (born 1982), American football coach and former NFL player * Chris Harris (speedway rider) (born 1982), English motorcycle speedway rider * Chris Harris (wrestler) (born 1973), American professional wrestler * Chris Harris Jr. (born 1989), American football cornerback for the Los Angeles Chargers ==Others== * Chris Harris (actor) (1942‚Äì2014), English performer and writer specialising in pantomime and comic acting * Chris Harris (author) (born 1964), English business author * Chris Harris (journalist) (born 1975), English automotive journalist and automotive racing driver * Chris Harris (New South Wales politician) (born 1951), City of Sydney councillor and Green politician * Chris Harris (Texas politician) (1948‚Äì2015), Texas State Representative and State Senator * Zeuss (Chris Harris, born 1972)), American record producer, mixer, guitarist, and songwriter ==See also== * Chris (name) * Harris (disambiguation) * Christopher Harris (disambiguation) * Christine Harris (disambiguation) * Christie Harris * Chris Heaton-Harris (born 1967), British Conservative Party politician ","title":"Chris Harris"},{"id":"1294633","text":"Erich Rudolf Bagge (30 May 1912, in Neustadt bei Coburg ‚Äì 5 June 1996, in Kiel) was a German scientist.

See Archive - Leipzig University. was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War. He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Physik in Berlin. Bagge, who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948, was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels, and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship-Building and Seafare. The first German nuclear vessel, the \\"NS Otto Hahn\\", was launched in 1962. A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons. == Uranium enrichment == Dr. Bagge developed a gaseous uranium enrichment device (Isotopenschleuse or isotope sluice)'German National Socialism and the Quest for Nuclear Power, 1939-49', see pp.133-135 by Mark Walker, published by Cambridge University Press, 1992. for enriching the U-235 isotope content of uranium in 1944, using three methods; centrifugal force, electromagnetism and thermal diffusion. It was built by BAMAG-MEGUIN under the direction of Kurt Diebner. Yellow cake uranium oxide powder was reacted with hydrofluoric acid to form gaseous uranium hexafluoride. It was pumped into the sluice, which consisted of a centrifuge and spun at great speeds to fling heavier non-fissile 238U to the periphery. Electromagnets helped to keep 235U nearer the core of the centrifuge. Slight heating near the bottom of the \\"bowl\\" helped 238U to migrate to the bottom whilst 235U bubbled to the top of the chamber. Uranium hexafluoride gas with an enriched content of 235U was then sluiced off the top layers. Bagge got a patent in 1955 for the isotope sluice but it never achieved any economic importance. == Post-war activity == From June to December 1945, Bagge was (together with Kurt Diebner, Walther Gerlach, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Werner Heisenberg, Horst Korsching, Max von Laue, Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, and Karl Wirtz) detained at Farm Hall near Cambridge, England. After the war, Bagge became Professor in Hamburg, later Professor and Head of the Department of Physics at the University of Kiel, Germany.

He was also a playwright, historian, journalist, editor, and publisher. In 1912 he founded the African Times and Orient Review, later revived as the African and Orient Review, which published in total through 1920. He lived and worked mostly in England, with time in the United States and Nigeria. In the latter location, he founded the Comet Press Ltd, and The Comet newspaper in Lagos. ==Early life== Ali was born in 1866 in Alexandria, Egypt. His father, Abdul Salem Ali, was an officer in the Egyptian Army. His mother was Sudanese. He received his early training in Egypt, but at the age of 9 or 10, his father arranged for him to go to England to be educated,David Dabydeen, John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), The Oxford Companion to Black British History, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 25. His father died in 1882 while serving at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in Egypt. After that, the younger Ali, then 16, was forced to return to Egypt. After settling affairs with his father's estate, Ali returned to England. As the ward of Canon Berry, he pursued studies at King's College London. Ali had originally intended to study as a doctor and had started on related studies before his father's death. Afterward he wanted to write and act. On completing his studies at the University of London, ==Actor and playwright== Ali was in the company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree and in Lillie Langtry's production of Antony and Cleopatra at the Royal Princess Theatre, London. As an actor, Ali toured the British Isles. He produced Othello and The Merchant of Venice at Hull, Yorkshire, in 1902, playing the parts of Othello and the Prince of Morocco. He earned praise from the British press. He wrote several plays, producing The Jew's Revenge (1903) at the Royal Surrey Theatre in London, A Cleopatra Night (1907) at Dundee, and the Lily of Bermuda (1909), a musical comedy at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. The productions were praised by the British and American press. His production and performance in A Daughter of Judah (1906), which he first produced in the Glasgow Empire Theatre (GET) received particularly good reviews. .\\" Mohamed toured in the United States, where he produced several plays and won recognition as an actor. In London, he founded the Hull Shakespeare Society, of which Sir Henry Irving was the first President. Representing his political interests and considerable British interest in the Orient, he founded the Anglo-Ottoman Society, London. Its members included Lords Newton, Lamington, Stourton and Mowbray. In 1915 Ali founded and was Secretary of the Indian Muslim Soldiers' Widows' and Orphans' War Fund. Among its patrons were Consuelo, the Duchess of Marlborough, the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, Sir Edward Grey, Lord and Lady Lamington, Lord and Lady Newton, the Marquis and Marchioness of Crew, Mrs. H. H. Asquith, Sir Austen and Lady Chamberlain, Lord Curzon, and almost all the members, of the British Cabinet. ==Lecturer and journalist== After the First Universal Races Congress held at the University of London in 1911, Ali, with the help of John Eldred Jones, a journalist from Sierra Leone, in 1912 founded the African Times and Orient Review (ATOR) in London. Financial assistance in launching the paper was given by some West Africans who were temporarily in London, including J. E. Casely Hayford, a journalist and activist; Francis T. Dove and C. W. Betts from Sierra Leone, founded as a British colony; and Dr. Oguntola Sapara from Lagos, Nigeria. The journal advocated Pan-African nationalism. It became a forum for African and other intellectuals and activists from around the world. It attracted numerous contributors, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Annie Besant, Sir Harry H. Johnston, Henry Francis Downing, and William H. Ferris. The young Marcus Garvey, then studying in London from Jamaica, frequently visited Ali's Fleet Street office and was mentored by him. The journal covered issues in the United States, the Caribbean, West Africa, South Africa, and Egypt. Garvey briefly worked for Ali and contributed an article to the journal's October 1913 issue. The journal ceased publication in October 1918 during the Great War, after it was banned by Britain in India and its African colonies. It was succeeded by the African and Orient Review, which operated through most of 1920. In Europe Mohamed Ali was considered an authority on Oriental [meaning the Near East at the time] affairs, political and social. Mohamed Ali also contributed to several leading European and American periodicals; his articles were translated and published in Germany, France, Austria, Turkey, Egypt and Japan. In 1921, following the demise of the African and Orient Review, Ali travelled to the United States, never returning to Britain. In the US he briefly worked with Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) movement. He also contributed articles on African issues to UNIA's the Negro World. He taught in a department of African affairs. ==Travels and settlement in Nigeria== Ali first travelled to Nigeria in July 1921. The Lagos community welcomed him at the Shitta Mosque. He returned to Lagos in 1931, primarily to watch over his interests in the cocoa business. He settled in Lagos, where he was appointed editor of the Nigerian Daily Times. On 3 October 1932, Ali produced the play A Daughter of Pharaoh in the Glover Memorial Hall, Lagos. According to The Nigerian Daily Times, it \\"set a new standard in Lagos entertainment, introducing real stagecraft.\\" Before long Ali became editor of the daily Daily Telegraph (Nigeria), having as his immediate assistant Ayo Lijadu (subsequently editor of the Nigerian Daily Times. Expanding his publishing interests, on 27 July 1933 Ali began publication of The Comet, a weekly newspaper. He took great interest in the educational and general welfare of the Muslim community in Lagos. Following a protracted illness, Mohamed Ali died at the age of 78 in the African Hospital, Lagos, on 25 June 1945. His funeral took place on 27 June 1945. Attendees numbered well over 5,000, including political, social and religious leaders. A short khutba (sermon) in English was delivered by L. B. Agusto, President of the Islamic Society of Nigeria. A short oration in Arabic was also delivered by D. Couri, a friend. A large funeral procession went through the streets to Okesuna Muslim Cemetery, where Ali was buried. ==Plays== *The Jew's Revenge (1903) * A Daughter of Judah (1906) * A Cleopatra Night (1907) * Lily of Bermuda (1909), musical comedy ==Journals and newspapers== *Founded African Times and Orient Review (1912) in London; superseded by African and Orient Review (1919) *Founded The Comet newspaper, Lagos, Nigeria ==References== ==Further reading== *Ali, Duse Mohamed, \\"Leaves from an Active Life,\\" The Comet, 1937‚Äì1938; The African Times and Orient Review (1912‚Äì1918) *Ian Duffield, \\"Duse Mohamed Ali, Afro-Asian Solidarity and Pan-Africanism in Early Twentieth-Century London\\", in S.

His peak Elo rating was 2644 in 2000. Gulko is noted to be the only person to win both the Soviet Chess Championship and the U.S. Chess Championship, and for having a positive score against Garry Kasparov. ==Life and career== Boris Gulko was born in 1947 to a Jewish family. His father was a soldier of the Red Army and was stationed in East Germany. His family returned to the Soviet Union after a few years. Gulko became an International Master in 1975, and a Grandmaster in 1976. He won the USSR Chess Championship at Leningrad in 1977 along with Iosif Dorfman. The Soviets usually would break ties for the title of Soviet Champion with a multi-game match, and 1977 was no exception. However, Gulko and Dorfman were even after the six game playoff, so they shared the title and prestige of Soviet Champion. They finished half a point ahead of a field that included three former World Champions. Shortly after, Gulko applied to leave the country, but permission was refused. He and his wife, Anna Akhsharumova, who is a Woman Grandmaster of chess, became prominent Soviet Refuseniks. As a vehement anti- Communist, he was once arrested and beaten by KGB agents. They weren't allowed in top-level chess competition until the period of glasnost arrived, and Gulko was finally allowed to immigrate to the United States in 1986. \\"Thirty-nine is too old to start playing and training to reach the highest achievement in chess,\\" said Boris, \\"those seven years were a serious blow for my chess career, but I don‚Äôt regret them.\\" After moving to the U.S. he won the U.S. Chess Championship in 1994 and 1999. He is the only chess player ever to have held both the American and Soviet championship titles. Gulko also holds an amazing positive score against Garry Kasparov, with three victories, four draws, and only one defeat, in games played from 1978 to 2001 (according to ChessGames.com). Gulko was subject to anti-semitic discrimination 20 years later. He qualified to play at the 2004 World Chess Championship in Libya. The president of the Libyan Organizing Committee, dictator Gaddafi‚Äôs son, announced: ‚ÄúWe did not and will not invite the Zionist enemies to this championship.‚Äù Gulko and several other Jewish players withdrew from the tournament, and Gulko said in a letter to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of FIDE: ‚ÄúI implore you not to be the first president of FIDE to preside over the first world chess championship from which Jews are excluded.

A medical guideline (also called a clinical guideline, standard treatment guideline, or clinical practice line) is a document with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment in specific areas of healthcare. Such documents have been in use for thousands of years during the entire history of medicine. However, in contrast to previous approaches, which were often based on tradition or authority, modern medical guidelines are based on an examination of current evidence within the paradigm of evidence-based medicine.Institute of Medicine (edt.) Clinical practice guidelines we can trust. Washington DC, 2011 They usually include summarized consensus statements on best practice in healthcare. A healthcare provider is obliged to know the medical guidelines of his or her profession, and has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of a guideline for an individual treatment.Council of Europe. Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice. Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002. ==Background== Modern clinical guidelines identify, summarize and evaluate the highest quality evidence and most current data about prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy including dosage of medications, risk/benefit and cost-effectiveness. Then they define the most important questions related to clinical practice and identify all possible decision options and their outcomes. Some guidelines contain decision or computation algorithms to be followed. Thus, they integrate the identified decision points and respective courses of action with the clinical judgement and experience of practitioners. Many guidelines place the treatment alternatives into classes to help providers in deciding which treatment to use. Additional objectives of clinical guidelines are to standardize medical care, to raise quality of care, to reduce several kinds of risk (to the patient, to the healthcare provider, to medical insurers and health plans) and to achieve the best balance between cost and medical parameters such as effectiveness, specificity, sensitivity, resolutiveness, etc. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the use of guidelines by healthcare providers such as hospitals is an effective way of achieving the objectives listed above, although they are not the only ones. ==Publication== Guidelines are usually produced at national or international levels by medical associations or governmental bodies, such as the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Local healthcare providers may produce their own set of guidelines or adapt them from existing top-level guidelines. Healthcare payers such as insurers practicing utilization management also publish guidelines. Special computer software packages known as guideline execution engines have been developed to facilitate the use of medical guidelines in concert with an electronic medical record system. The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) is a computer representation format for clinical guidelines that can be used with such engines.GLIF website The USA and other countries maintain medical guideline clearinghouses. In the US, the National Guideline Clearinghouse maintains a catalog of high-quality guidelines published by various health and medical associations. In the United Kingdom, clinical practice guidelines are published primarily by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In The Netherlands, two bodies‚Äîthe Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) and College of General Practitioners (NHG)‚Äîhave published specialist and primary care guidelines, respectively. In Germany, the German Agency for Quality in Medicine (√ÑZQ) coordinates a national program for disease management guidelines. All these organisations are now members of the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), an international network of organisations and individuals involved in clinical practice guidelines. ==Compliance== Checklists have been used in medical practice to attempt to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the World Health Organization by Dr. Atul Gawande. According to a meta-analysis after introduction of the checklist mortality dropped by 23% and all complications by 40%, but further high- quality studies are required to make the meta-analysis more robust. In the UK, a study on the implementation of a checklist for provision of medical care to elderly patients admitting to hospital found that the checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices, but that work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex multidisciplinary care. ==Problems== Guidelines may lose their clinical relevance as they age and newer research emerges. Even 20% of strong recommendations, especially when based on opinion rather than trials, from practice guidelines may be retracted. The New York Times reported in 2004 that some simple clinical practice guidelines are not routinely followed to the extent they might be.Gina Kolata \\"Program Coaxes Hospitals to See Treatments Under Their Noses\\". The New York Times December 25, 2004. It has been found that providing a nurse or other medical assistant with a checklist of recommended procedures can result in the attending physician being reminded in a timely manner regarding procedures that might have been overlooked. Guidelines may have both methodological problems and conflict of interest. As such, the quality of guidelines may vary substantially, especially for guidelines that are published on-line and have not had to follow methodological reporting standards often required by reputable clearinghouses. Patients and caregivers are frequently excluded from clinical guidelines development, in part because there is a lack of guidance for how to include them in the process. Guidelines may make recommendations that are stronger than the supporting evidence. In response to many of these problems with traditional guidelines, the BMJ created a new series of trustworthy guidelines focused on the most pressing medical issues called BMJ Rapid Recommendations. ==Examples== * The American Heart Association Guidelines for the Prevention of Infective Endocarditis * The BMJ Rapid Recommendation guideline on transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. ==See also== * Clinical formulation * Clinical prediction rule * Clinical trial protocol * Medical algorithm * Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter ==References== ==External links== * British Columbia Medical Guidelines ‚Äì In Canada, British Columbia's guidelines and protocols are developed under the direction of the Guidelines and Protocols Advisory Committee (GPAC), jointly sponsored by the B.C.

He composed primarily in Welsh, but was also responsible for the first known poem in the English language written by a Welshman. His father Hywel Swrdwal was also a poet, and there are doubts as to whether a number of extant works should be attributed to the father or to the son. He is reputed to have composed a history of Wales, but this has not survived. The Hymn to the Virgin was written by Ieuan at Oxford in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the awdl, and Welsh orthography; for example: The poem consists of 96 lines in 13 stanzas. It is an address to Christ through the Virgin Mary. An alternative claim for the first poem in English written by a Welshman is made for John Clanvowe's The Book of Cupid, God of Love or The Cuckoo and the Nightingale, a long love poem based on The Owl and the Nightingale. ==References== Garlick, Raymond, and Roland Mathias.

It looks at Wales from an international perspective, and at the world from the standpoint of Wales. The magazine enjoys a vibrant and diverse international readership, and is read by key figures in the Welsh political cultural scene. ==History== Planet publishes high-quality writing, artwork and photography by established and emerging figures, and covers subjects across politics, the arts, literature, current events, social justice questions, minority language and culture, the environment and more. It was originally set up as a bi-monthly publication by Ned Thomas in 1970, and was published continually until 1979. This followed a decision in 1967 to devolve the function of The Arts Council of Great Britain in Wales to the Welsh Arts Council. Thomas explained that \\"The arts council's literature director, Meic Stephens, had a vision of creating a publishing base in Wales that hadn't existed before\\". The magazine was renamed Planet: The Welsh Internationalist in 1977. On the eve of the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum, predicting a \\"no\\" vote, Thomas decided to bring the magazine to an end as he believed \\"that a no vote would mean that Planet's stance and ideology had failed, and a yes vote would mean that Wales needed a magazine published more often than once every two months\\". He was persuaded to relaunch the magazine in 1985, and with improved funding, John Barnie was employed as a full-time assistant before becoming editor in 1990. Barnie was succeeded by his wife Helle Michelsen, in 2006, and in 2010 by Jasmine Donahaye. In 2012, Emily Trahair became the current editor, with Dafydd Prys ap Morus as Production Editor and Helen Pendry as Assistant Editor. With Helen and Dafydd departing, Lowri Angharad Pearson joined in 2015 as Administrative and Marketing Assistant and Hywel Edwards in 2017 as Production Officer. The team also puts together the Planet Extra website. In 2002, funding was moved from the Arts Council to the Welsh Books Council, and in 2009, the Welsh Books Council changed their magazine's funding remit to a quarterly. The first expanded quarterly issue was published in April of that year. The magazine celebrated its 40th anniversary with its 200th issue in November 2010. Originally published in Llangeitho, the magazine's headquarters later moved to the publishing heartland of Aberystwyth. Planet also publishes a book imprint. ==Editors== *1970-1990 Ned Thomas *1990-2006 John Barnie *2006-2010 Helle Michelsen *2010-2012 Jasmine Donahaye *2012- Emily Trahair ==References== ==External links== *Magazine web site Category:Aberystwyth Category:Visual arts magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Bi-monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Political magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1970 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1979 Category:Literary magazines published in Wales ","title":"Planet (magazine)"},{"id":"1294720","text":"Dictation can refer to: *Dictation (exercise), when one person speaks while another person transcribes *Dictation: A Quartet, a collection of short stories by Cynthia Ozick, published in 2008 *Digital dictation, the use of digital electronic media for dictation *Music dictation, an ear training exercise in which the student copies down music while listening to it ==See also== *Dictatorship *Dication ","title":"Dictation"},{"id":"1294755","text":"Salisbury Cathedral, which developed the Sarum Use in the Middle Ages. The Use of Sarum (or Use of Salisbury, also known as the Sarum Rite) is the Latin liturgical rite developed at Salisbury Cathedral from the late eleventh century until the English Reformation. It is largely identical to the Roman rite, with about ten per cent of its material drawn from other sources. The cathedral's liturgy was widely respected during the late Middle Ages, and churches throughout the British Isles and parts of northwestern Europe adapted its customs for celebrations of the Eucharist and Liturgy of the Hours. The use has a unique ecumenical position in influencing and being authorized by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches. ==Origins== A page from a Sarum missal. The woodcut shows an altar shortly before the English Reformation. In 1078, William of Normandy appointed Osmund, a Norman nobleman, as bishop of Salisbury (the period name of the site whose ruins are now known as Old Sarum). As bishop, Osmund initiated some revisions to the extant Celtic-Anglo-Saxon rite and the local adaptations of the Roman rite, drawing on both Norman and Anglo-Saxon traditions. Nineteenth-century liturgists theorized that the liturgical practices of Rouen in northern France inspired the Sarum liturgical books. The Normans had deposed most of the Anglo-Saxon episcopate, replacing them with Norman bishops, of which Osmund was one. Given the similarities between the liturgy in Rouen and that of Sarum, it appears the Normans imported their French liturgical books as well. ==Dissemination== The revisions during Osmund's episcopate resulted in the compilation of a new missal, breviary, and other liturgical manuals, which came to be used throughout southern England, Wales, and parts of Ireland. Some dioceses issued their own missals, inspired by the Sarum rite, but with their own particular prayers and ceremonies. Some of these are so different that they have been identified as effectively distinct liturgies, such as those of Hereford, York, Bangor, and Aberdeen. Other missals (such as those of Lincoln Cathedral or Westminster Abbey) were more evidently based on the Sarum rite and varied only in details. Liturgical historians believe the Sarum rite had a distinct influence upon other usages of the Roman rite outside England, such as the Nidaros rite in Norway and the Braga Rite in Portugal. ==Reception== Even after the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church, the Canterbury Convocation declared in 1543 that the Sarum Breviary would be used for the canonical hours. Under Edward VI of England, the use provided the foundational material for the Book of Common Prayer and remains influential in English liturgies. Mary I restored the Use of Sarum in 1553, but it fell out of use under Elizabeth I. Sarum Use remains a permitted use for Roman Catholics, as Pope Pius V permitted the continuation of uses more than two hundred years old under the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum. In practice, a brief resurgence of interest in the 19th century did not lead to a revival. Some Western-Rite Orthodox congregations have adopted the use due to its antiquity and similarities with the Byzantine Rite. This includes Western Rite members of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. In spite of interest in the Sarum Use, its publication in Latin sources from the sixteenth century and earlier has inhibited its modern adoption. Several academic projects are gradually improving its accessibility. In 2009‚Äì13, Bangor University produced a series of films and other resources as part of 'The Experience of Worship' research project. In 2006, McMaster University launched an ongoing project to create an edition and English translation of the complete Sarum Use with its original plainsong, resulting in the publication of over 10,000 musical works, and expected to be completed in 2022. ==Sarum ritual== Illustration from a manuscript on the Sarum Rite, c. 1400 The ceremonies of the Sarum Rite are elaborate when compared not only to the post-1969 Roman Rite Mass, but even to the Tridentine Mass. The Mass of Sundays and great feasts involved up to four sacred ministers: priest, deacon, subdeacon, and acolyte. It was customary for them to visit in procession all the altars of the church and cense them, ending at the great rood screen, where antiphons and collects would be sung. At the screen would be read the Bidding Prayers, prayers in the vernacular directing the people to pray for various intentions. The procession then vested for Mass. (This vesting would usually have taken place at the altar where Mass was to be celebrated, since vestries and sacristies are, except in the largest churches, largely a modern introduction.) Some of the prayers of the Mass are unique, such as the priest's preparation prayers for Holy Communion. Some ceremonies differ from the Tridentine Mass, though they are not unknown in other forms of the Western Rite: the offering of the bread and wine was (as in the Dominican and other rites) made by one act. The chalice was prepared between the readings of the Epistle and the Gospel. In addition, in common with many monastic rites, after the Elevation the celebrant stood with his arms outstretched in the form of a cross; the Particle was put into the chalice after the Agnus Dei. It is probable that communion under one kind was followed by a 'rinse' of unconsecrated wine. The first chapter of St John's Gospel was read while the priest made his way back to the sacristy. Two candles on the altar were customary, though others were placed around it and on the rood screen. The Sarum missal calls for a low bow as an act of reverence, rather than the genuflection. ===Influence on Anglo-Catholics=== The ritual of Sarum Use has influenced even churches that do not use its text, obscuring understanding of the original: Many of the ornaments and ceremonial practices associated with the Sarum rite‚Äîthough not the full liturgy itself‚Äîwere revived in the Anglican Communion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as part of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement in the Church of England. Some Anglo-Catholics wanted to find a traditional formal liturgy that was characteristically \\"English\\" rather than \\"Roman.\\" They took advantage of the 'Ornaments Rubric' of 1559, which directed that English churches were to use \\"...such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all Times of their Ministration, shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of England, by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of the Reign of Edward VI of England, i.e. January 1548 - January 1549, before the First Prayer Book came into effect in June of the latter year (which authorized the use of traditional vestments and was quite explicit that the priest shall wear an alb, vestment (=chasuble) or cope and that the deacons shall be vested in albs and tunicles (dalmatics). However, there was a tendency to read back Victorian centralizing tendencies into mediaeval texts, and so a rather rubrical spirit was applied to liturgical discoveries. It was asserted, for instance, that Sarum had a well-developed series of colours of vestments for different feasts. There may have been tendencies to use a particular colour for a particular feast (red, for instance, was used on Sundays, as in the Ambrosian rite), but most churches were simply too poor to have several sets of vestments, and so used what they had. There was considerable variation from diocese to diocese, or even church to church, in the details of the rubrics: the place where the Epistle was sung, for instance, varied enormously; from a lectern at the altar, from a lectern in the quire, to the feature described as the 'pulpitum', a word used ambiguously for the place of reading (a pulpit) or for the rood screen. Some scholars thought that the readings were proclaimed from the top of the rood screen, which was most unlikely given the tiny access doors to the rood loft in most churches. This would not have permitted dignified access for a vested Gospel procession. Chief among the proponents of Sarum customs was the Anglican priest Percy Dearmer, who put these into practice (according to his own interpretation) at his parish of St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, in London. He explained them at length in The Parson's Handbook, which ran through several editions. This style of worship has been retained in some present-day Anglican churches and monastic institutions, where it is known as \\"English Use\\" (Dearmer's term) or \\"Prayer Book Catholicism\\". ==References== ==External links== *The Use of Sarum, commonly known as the Sarum Rite: ongoing edition and English translation of the complete Sarum Use *The Experience of Worship: films and resources for the general public on worship in late medieval England produced in 2009‚Äì13 Category:Anglican sacraments Category:Anglo-Catholicism Category:Book of Common Prayer Category:Latin liturgical rites Category:Diocese of Salisbury ","title":"Use of Sarum"},{"id":"1294756","text":"Severinus of Noricum ( 410 ‚Äì 8 January 482) is a saint, known as the \\"Apostle to Noricum\\". It has been speculated that he was born in either Southern Italy or in the Roman province of Africa. Severinus himself refused to discuss his personal history before his appearance along the Danube in Noricum, after the death of Attila in 453. However, he did mention experiences with eastern desert monasticism, and his vita draws connections between Severinus and Saint Anthony of Egypt. Saint Severinus of Noricum is not to be confused with Severinus of Septempeda, the brother of Saint Victorinus of Camerino, and a bishop of Naples. == Life == Little is known of his origins. The mysterious high-born Severinus is first recorded as travelling along the Danube in Noricum and Bavaria, preaching Christianity, procuring supplies for the starving, redeeming captives and establishing monasteries at Passau and Favianae,Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúSaint Severinus, Abbot, and Apostle of Noricum, or Austria‚Äù.

His efforts seem to have won him wide respect, including that of the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. Eugippius credits him with the prediction that Odoacer would become king of Rome. However, Severinus warned that Odoacer would rule not more than fourteen years. Severinus also supposedly prophesied the destruction of Asturis (perhaps ), Austria, by the Huns under Attila. He established refugee centers for people displaced by the invasion, and founded monasteries to re-establish spirituality and preserve learning in the stricken region. He died in his monastic cell at Favianae while singing Psalm 150. Six years after his death, his monks were driven from their abbey, and his body was taken to Italy, where it was at first kept in the Castel dell'Ovo, Naples, then eventually interred at the Benedictine monastery rededicated to him, the Abbey of San Severino in the city of Naples. Severinus was the childhood guardian and spiritual father of St. Anthony the Hermit. == Accounts of his life == The coat of arms of San Severo, Apulia, feature Saint Severinus. Paul the Deacon, in his 8th-century History of the Lombards, mentions the monastery founded by Severinus at Eiferingen, at the foot of the Kahlenberg, not far from Vienna: The Vita of Severinus was written by Eugippius. Beyond Eugippius' work, the only other contemporary source that mentions Saint Severinus is the Vita beati Antonii by Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia. In the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon notes that the disciples of Saint Severinus were invited by a \\"Neapolitan lady\\" to bring his body to the villa in 488, \\"in the place of Augustulus, who was probably no more.\\" The villa was converted into a monastery before 500 to hold the saint's remains. Martin Luther made reference to St. Severinus in point 29 of his famous Ninety-five Theses suggesting that it is unclear whether all of the souls in purgatory desire to be brought out from it. == Notes == == References == * Giesriegl, K.

Security alarms are used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties for protection against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders. Security alarms in residential areas show a correlation with decreased theft. Car alarms likewise help protect vehicles and their contents. Prisons also use security systems for control of inmates. Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors. Systems range from small, self- contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer monitoring and control. It may even include two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and Monitoring station. == Design == Exterior alarm bell box Alarm CPU panel with inputs and outputs The most basic alarm consists of one or more sensors to detect intruders, and an alerting device to indicate the intrusion. However, a typical premises security alarm employs the following components: * Premises control unit (PCU), Alarm Control Panel (ACP), or simply panel: The \\"brain\\" of the system, it reads sensor inputs, tracks arm/disarm status, and signals intrusions. In modern system, this is typically one or more computer circuit boards inside a metal enclosure, along with a power supply. * Sensors: Devices which detect intrusions. Sensors may be placed at the perimeter of the protected area, within it, or both. Sensors can detect intruders by a variety of methods, such as monitoring doors and windows for opening, or by monitoring unoccupied interiors for motions, sound, vibration, or other disturbances. * Alerting devices: These indicate an alarm condition. Most commonly, these are bells, sirens, and/or flashing lights. Alerting devices serve the dual purposes of warning occupants of intrusion, and potentially scaring off burglars. These devices may also be used to warn occupants of a fire or smoke condition. * Keypads: Small devices, typically wall-mounted, which function as the human-machine interface to the system. In addition to buttons, keypads typically feature indicator lights, a small multi-character display, or both.etc. * Interconnections between components. This may consist of direct wiring to the control unit, or wireless links with local power supplies. In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the premises control unit contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, notifying police, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals may be transmitted via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet. ==Sensor types== ===Hermetically sealed reed switches=== The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or normally closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the design is normally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components. ===Passive infrared detectors=== A passive infrared sensor used to detect motion The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensors found in household and small business environments. It offers affordable and reliable functionality. The term passive refers to the fact that the detector does not generate or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by detecting the heat energy given off by other objects. Strictly speaking, PIR sensors do not detect motion; rather, they detect abrupt changes in temperature at a given point. As an intruder walks in front of the sensor, the temperature at that point will rise from room temperature to body temperature, and then back again. This quick change triggers the detection. PIR sensors may be designed to be wall- or ceiling- mounted, and come in various fields of view, from narrow-point detectors to 360-degree fields. PIRs require a power supply in addition to the detection signalling circuit. === Infrasound detectors === The infrasound detector works by detecting infrasound, or sound waves at frequencies below 20 hertz. Sounds at those frequencies are inaudible to the human ear. Due to its inherent properties, infrasound can travel distances of many hundreds of kilometers. Infrasound signals can result from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, gravity waves, opening and closing of doors, forcing windows to name a few. The entire infrasound detection system consists of the following components: a speaker (infrasound sensor) as a microphone input, an order-frequency filter, an analog to digital (A/D) converter, and finally an MCU, which is used to analyse the recorded signal. Each time a potential intruder tries enter into a house, she or he tests whether it is closed and locked, uses tools on openings, or/and applies pressure, and therefore he or she creates low- frequency sound vibrations. Such actions are immediately detected by the infrasound detector before the intruder breaks in. The primary purpose of such system is to stop burglars before they enter the house, to avoid not only theft, but vandalism. The sensitivity can be modulated depending on the size of a house and presence of animals. ===Ultrasonic detectors=== Using frequencies between 15 kHz and 75 kHz, these active detectors transmit ultrasonic sound waves that are inaudible to humans. The Doppler shift principle is the underlying method of operation, in which a change in frequency is detected due to object motion. This is caused when the object must cause a change in the ultrasonic frequency to the receiver relative to the transmitting frequency. The ultrasonic detector operates by the transmitter emitting an ultrasonic signal into the area to be protected. The sound waves are reflected by solid objects (such as the surrounding floor, walls and ceiling) and then detected by the receiver. Because ultrasonic waves are transmitted through air, then hard-surfaced objects tend to reflect most of the ultrasonic energy, while soft surfaces tend to absorb most energy. When the surfaces are stationary, the frequency of the waves detected by the receiver will be equal to the transmitted frequency. However, a change in frequency will occur as a result of the Doppler principle, when a person or object is moving towards or away from the detector. Such an event initiates an alarm signal. This technology is considered obsolete by many alarm professionals, and is not actively installed. ===Microwave detectors=== This device emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves or reduction in beam intensity using a receiver. The transmitter and receiver are usually combined inside a single housing (monostatic) for indoor applications, and separate housings (bistatic) for outdoor applications. To reduce false alarms this type of detector is usually combined with a passive infrared detector, or Dual Tec brand or similar alarm. Microwave detectors respond to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the reflected energy, by a phase shift, or by a sudden reduction of the level of received energy. Any of these effects may indicate motion of an intruder. * Advantages: low cost, easy to install, invisible perimeter barrier * Disadvantages: May be affected by weather conditions like rain, snow and fog. Typically need a sterile clearance area to prevent partial blocking of the detection field. ===Compact surveillance radar=== Compact surveillance radar emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves. They are similar to microwave detectors but can detect the precise location of intruders in areas extending over hundreds of acres. With the capability of measuring range, angle, velocity, direction and size of the target, a CSR is able to pinpoint a precise GPS coordinate of an intruder. This target information is typically displayed on a map, user interface or situational awareness software that defines geographical alert zones or geofences with different types of actions initiated depending on time of day and other factors. CSR is commonly used to protect outside the fenceline of critical facilities such as electrical substations, power plants, dams, and bridges. ===Photoelectric beams=== Photoelectric beam system detect the presence of an intruder by transmitting visible or infrared light beams across an area, where these beams may be obstructed. To improve the detection surface area, the beams are often employed in stacks of two or more. However, if an intruder is aware of the technology's presence, it can be avoided. The technology can be an effective long-range detection system, if installed in stacks of three or more where the transmitters and receivers are staggered to create a fence-like barrier. Systems are available for both internal and external applications. To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a sealed condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source. ===Glass-break detection=== The glass-break detector may be used for internal perimeter building protection. Glass-break acoustic detectors are mounted in close proximity to the glass panes and listen for sound frequencies associated with glass breaking. Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition. Window foil is a less sophisticated, mostly outdated detection method that involves gluing a thin strip of conducting foil on the inside of the glass and putting low-power electric current through it. Breaking the glass is practically guaranteed to tear the foil and break the circuit. ===Smoke, heat, and carbon monoxide detectors=== Most systems may also be equipped with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24-hour zones (which are on at all times). Smoke and heat detectors protect from the risk of fire using different detection methods. Carbon monoxide detectors help protect from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Although an intruder alarm panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system. Traditional smoke detectors are technically ionisation smoke detectors which create an electric current between two metal plates, which sound an alarm when disrupted by smoke entering the chamber. Ionisation smoke alarms can quickly detect the small amounts of smoke produced by fast-flaming fires, such as cooking fires or those fueled by paper or flammable liquids. A newer, and perhaps safer, type is a photoelectric smoke detector. It contains a light source in a light-sensitive electric sensor, which is positioned at a 90-degree angles to the sensor. Normally, light from the light source shoots straight across and misses the sensor. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the sensor and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors typically respond faster to a fire in its early, smoldering stage ‚Äì before the source of the fire bursts into flames. ===Motion sensors=== Motion sensors are devices that use various forms of technology to detect movement. The technology typically found in motion sensors to trigger an alarm includes infrared, ultrasonic, vibration and contact. Dual technology sensors combine two or more forms of detection in order to reduce false alarms as each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Traditionally motion sensors are an integral part of a home security system. These devices are typically installed to cover a large area as they commonly cover up to 40 ft with a 135¬∞ field of vision. ===Driveway alarms=== Driveway alarm systems can be tied into most security and automation systems. They are designed to alert residents to unexpected visitors, intruders, or deliveries arriving at the property. They come in magnetic and infrared motion sensing options. Driveway alarms can also be purchased in hard-wired and wireless systems. They are common in rural security systems as well as for commercial applications. ===Electro-mechanical (shaker) sensors=== These electro-mechanical devices are mounted on barriers and are used primarily to detect an attack on the structure itself. The technology relies on an unstable mechanical configuration that forms part of the electrical circuit. When movement or vibration occurs, the unstable portion of the circuit moves and breaks the current flow, which produces an alarm. The medium transmitting the vibration must be correctly selected for the specific sensor as they are best suited to different types of structures and configurations. This technology is gradually being replaced by intelligent digital accelerometer-based systems. * Advantages: Low-cost and easily installed on existing fences. * Disadvantages: Must be fence-mounted. Being mechanical in nature, the system is unable to analyze differences in the pattern of vibrations (for example, the difference between gusts of wind and a person climbing the fence). ===Passive magnetic field detection=== This buried security system is based on the magnetic anomaly detection principle of operation. The system uses an electromagnetic field generator powered by two wires running in parallel. Both wires run along the perimeter and are usually installed about 5\\"/12 cm apart on top of a wall or about 12\\"/30 cm below ground. The wires are connected to a signal processor which analyses any change in the magnetic field. This kind of buried security system sensor cable could be embedded in the top of almost any kind of wall to provide a regular wall detection ability, or can be buried in the ground. They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars. However, they cannot be installed near high voltage lines, or radar transmitters. ===Electrostatic field=== Sometimes referred to as E-field, this volumetric sensor uses Electric field proximity sensing and can be installed on buildings, perimeters, fences, and walls. It also has the ability to be installed free-standing on dedicated poles. The system uses an electromagnetic field generator powering one wire, with another sensing wire running parallel to it. The sensing wire is connected to a signal processor that analyses: * amplitude change (mass of intruder), * rate change (movement of intruder), * preset disturbance time (time the intruder is in the pattern). These items define the characteristics of an intruder and when all three are detected simultaneously, an alarm signal is generated. The barrier can provide vertical protection from the ground to the height of the mounting posts (typically 4-6 metres of height), depending on the number of sensor wires installed. It is usually configured in zones of about 200 metre lengths. * Advantage: High-security (difficult to defeat), high vertical detection field. * Disadvantages: Expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost). ===Microphonic systems=== Strain-sensor cable installed on a chain-link/barbed-wire fenceMicrophonic systems vary in design (for example, time-domain reflectrometry or piezo-electric) but each is generally based on the detection of an intruder attempting to cut or climb over a fence. Usually the microphonic detection systems are installed as sensor cables attached to rigid chainwire fences, however some specialised versions of these systems can also be installed as buried systems underground. Depending on the version selected, it can be sensitive to different frequencies or levels of noise or vibration. The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensor cable with the controller having the ability to differentiate between signals from the cable or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad weather conditions. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. The tuning of the system is usually accomplished during commissioning of the detection devices. * Advantages: Relatively inexpensive compared to other systems and easy to install. * Disadvantage: some systems have a high rate of false alarms because some of these sensors might be too sensitive. Although systems using DSP (digital signal processing) will largely eliminate false alarms on some cases. ===Taut wire fence systems=== A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack. *Advantages: low rate of false alarms, very reliable sensors, and high rate of detection. *Disadvantages: very expensive and complicated to install. ===Fibre optic cable=== A fibre-optic cable can be used to detect intruders by measuring the difference in the amount of light sent through the fibre core. A variety of fiber optic sensing technologies may be used, including rayleigh scattering or interferometry, If the cable is disturbed, the light will be changed and the intrusion detected. The cable can be attached directly to a chainwire fence or bonded into a barbed steel tape that is used to protect the tops of walls and fences. This type of barbed tape provides a good physical deterrent as well as giving an immediate alarm if the tape is cut or severely distorted. * Advantages: Being cable-based, very similar to the microphonic system and easy to install. * Disadvantage: Typically performs in a manner similar to microphonic-based systems but at a higher cost and complexity due to the use of fiber optic technology. ===Ported coaxial cable=== right This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (3 ft) apart. The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable. When the change in field strength weakens due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is covert after installation. Care must be taken to ensure the surrounding soil offers good drainage in order to avoid nuisance alarms. *Advantage: concealed as a buried form. *Disadvantages: can be affected by RF noise, difficult to install. ===Security electric fence=== Multi-zone security electric fence used on top of a physical barrier Security electric fences consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security electric fence energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, and/or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone. In practical terms, security electric fences are a type of sensor array that acts as a (or part of a) physical barrier, a psychological deterrent to potential intruders, and as part of a security alarm system. *Advantages: less expensive than many other methods, less likely to give false alarms than many other alternative perimeter security methods, and highest psychological deterrent of all methods. *Disadvantage: potential for unintended shock. == Wired, wireless, and hybrid systems== Installing a wireless magnetic contact breaker on a door The trigger signal from every sensor is transmitted to one or more control unit(s) either through wires or wireless means (radio, line carrier, infrared). Wired systems are convenient when sensors (such as PIRs, smoke detectors, etc.) require external power to operate correctly; however, they may be more costly to install. Entry-level wired systems utilize a star network topology, where the panel is at the center logically, and all devices home run their line wires back to the panel. More complex panels use a Bus network topology where the wire basically is a data loop around the perimeter of the facility, and has drops for the sensor devices which must include a unique device identifier integrated into the sensor device itself (e.g. id. biscuit). Wired systems also have the advantage, if wired properly for example by dual loop, of being tamper- evident. Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less expensive start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on distance and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home easily, an advantage for those who rent or who move frequently. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system protects against a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of an internet provider. This full wireless setup is commonly referred to as 100% wireless. Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensors to achieve the benefits of both. Transmitters can also be connected through the premises' electrical circuits to transmit coded signals to the control unit (line carrier). The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, etc.). ==Alarm connection and monitoring== Depending upon the application, the alarm output may be local, remote or a combination. Local alarms do not include monitoring, though may include indoor and/or outdoor sounders (e.g. motorized bell or electronic siren) and lights (e.g. strobe light) which may be useful for signaling an evacuation notice for people during fire alarms, or where one hopes to scare off an amateur burglar quickly. However, with the widespread use of alarm systems (especially in cars), false alarms are very frequent and many urbanites tend to ignore alarms rather than investigating, let alone contacting the necessary authorities. In short, there may be no response at all. In rural areas where nobody may hear the fire bell or burglar siren, lights or sounds may not make much difference, as the nearest emergency responders may arrive too late to avoid losses. Remote alarm systems are used to connect the control unit to a predetermined monitor of some sort, and they come in many different configurations. High-end systems connect to a central station or first responder (e.g. police/fire/medical) via a direct phone wire, a cellular network, a radio network (i.e. GPRS/GSM), or an IP path. In the case of a dual signalling system two of these options are utilized simultaneously. The alarm monitoring includes not only the sensors, but also the communication transmitter itself. While direct phone circuits are still available in some areas from phone companies, because of their high cost and the advent of dual signalling with its comparatively lower cost they are becoming uncommon. Direct connections are now most usually seen only in federal, state, and local government buildings, or on a school campus that has a dedicated security, police, fire, or emergency medical department (in the UK communication is only possible to an alarm receiving centre ‚Äì communication directly to the emergency services is not permitted). More typical systems incorporate a digital cellular communication unit that will contact the central station (or some other location) via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and raise the alarm, either with a synthesized voice or increasingly via an encoded message string that the central station decodes. These may connect to the regular phone system on the system side of the demarcation point, but typically connect on the customer side ahead of all phones within the monitored premises so that the alarm system can seize the line by cutting-off any active calls and call the monitoring company if needed. A dual signalling system would raise the alarm wirelessly via a radio path (GPRS/GSM) or cellular path using the phone line or broadband line as a back-up overcoming any compromise to the phone line. Encoders can be programmed to indicate which specific sensor was triggered, and monitors can show the physical location (or \\"zone\\") of the sensor on a list or even a map of the protected premises, which can make the resulting response more effective. For example, a heat sensor alarm, coupled with a flame detector in the same area is a more reliable indication of an actual fire than just one or the other sensor indication by itself. Many alarm panels are equipped with a backup communication path for use when the primary PSTN circuit is not functioning. The redundant dialer may be connected to a second communication path, or a specialized encoded cellular phone, radio, or internet interface device to bypass the PSTN entirely, to thwart intentional tampering with the phone line(s). Just the fact that someone tampered with the line could trigger a supervisory alarm via the radio network, giving early warning of an imminent problem (e.g. arson). In some cases a remote building may not have PSTN phone service, and the cost of trenching and running a direct line may be prohibitive. It is possible to use a wireless cellular or radio device as the primary communication method. In the UK the most popular solution of this kind is similar in principle to the above but with the primary and back up paths reversed. Utilizing a radio path (GPRS/GSM) as the primary signalling path is not only quicker than PSTN but also allows huge cost savings as unlimited amounts of data can be sent at no extra expense. ==Broadband alarm monitoring== Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service. Dial-up analog alarm panels or systems with serial/parallel data ports may be migrated to broadband through the addition of an alarm server device which converts telephone signaling signals or data port traffic to IP messages suitable for broadband transmission. But the direct use of VoIP (POTS port on premises terminal) to transport analog alarms without an alarm server device is problematic as the audio codecs used throughout the entire network transmission path cannot guarantee a suitable level of reliability or quality of service acceptable for the application. In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often can use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products. When the Internet is used as a primary signaling method for critical security and life safety applications, frequent supervision messages are configured to overcome concerns about backup power for network equipment and signal delivery time. But for typical applications, connectivity concerns are controlled by normal supervision messages, sent daily or weekly. Various IP Alarm transmission protocols exist but most in use today are proprietary. Just as the formats used for conventional telephone reporting were standardized and published, broadband signaling for alarm reporting is being standardized today. In 2007, US alarm manufacturers developed an open standard called DC-09. This standard has been accepted as an American National Standard, and is published as ANSI/SIA DC-09-2007. [ref: ANSI/SIA DC-09-2007] The protocol provides an encoding scheme and transport mechanism to carry data from 17 previously defined alarm protocols, including the latest Contact ID, SIA DC-03 and SIA 2000 protocols. [ref: ANSI/SIA DC-07-2001.04] Several manufacturers of panels and receivers are reported to be developing or have released support for DC-09. ==Radio alarm dual signalling== Dual signalling is a method of alarm transmission that uses a mobile phone network and a telephone and/or IP path to transmit intruder, fire and personal attack signals at high speed from the protected premises to an Alarm Receiving Centre (ARC). It most commonly uses GPRS or GSM, a high-speed signalling technology used to send and receive ‚Äòpackets‚Äô of data, with a telephone line in addition. The option of IP is not used as frequently due to issues with installation and configuration as a high level of I.T expertise is often required in addition to alarm installation knowledge. A dual signalling communication device is attached to a control panel on a security installation and is the component that transmits the alarm to the ARC. It can do this in a number of different ways, via the GPRS radio path, via the GSM radio path or via the telephone line/or IP if that has been chosen. These multiple signalling paths are all present and live at the same time backing each other up to minimise exposure of the property to intruders. Should one fail there is always one form of back up and depending on the manufacturer chosen up to three paths working simultaneously at any one time. Prior to the availability of dual signalling systems, police and keyholders were often called out to the premises because of an alarm signal on the telephone path only to discover that it was a network fault and not a genuine alarm Dual paths allow distinction between hardware failures and a genuine attack on the alarm. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. Dual signalling has helped considerably with the restoration of Police response as in an instance where a phone line is cut as the dual signalling device can continue to send alarm calls via one of its alternative paths either confirming or denying the alarm from the initial path. In the UK, CSL DualCom Ltd pioneered dual signalling in 1996. In doing so, the company offered the first credible alternative to existing alarm signalling while setting the current standard for professional dual path security monitoring. Dual signalling is now firmly regarded as the standard format for alarm signalling and is duly specified by all of the leading insurance companies. ==Listen-in alarm monitoring== Monitored alarms and speaker phones allow for the central station to speak with the homeowner or intruder. This may be beneficial to the owner for medical emergencies. For actual break-ins, the speaker phones allow the central station to urge the intruder to cease and desist as response units have been dispatched. Listen-in alarm monitoring is also known as Immediate Audio-Response monitoring or Speaking Alarm Systems in the UK. ==Alarm monitoring services== The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management. Increasingly, the Central Stations are making this information available directly to end users via the internet and a secure log- on to view and create custom reports on these events themselves. ==Alarm response== In the United States, police respond to at least 36 million alarm activations each year, at an estimated annual cost of $1.8 billion. Depending upon the zone triggered, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other factors, the alarm monitoring center may automatically initiate various actions. Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency services immediately, or to first call the protected premises or property manager to try to determine if the alarm is genuine. Operators could also start calling a list of phone numbers provided by the customer to contact someone to go check on the protected premises. Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which room may be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Some alarm systems use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to verify the legitimacy of an alarm. In some municipalities around the United States, this type of alarm verification allows the property it is protecting to be placed on a \\"verified response\\" list, allowing for quicker and safer police responses. The first video home security system was patentedU.S. Patent #3,482,037 on December 2, 1969 to inventor Marie Brown. The system used television surveillance. ==Access control and bypass codes== To be useful, an intrusion alarm system is deactivated or reconfigured when authorized personnel are present. Authorization may be indicated in any number of ways, often with keys or codes used at the control panel or a remote panel near an entry. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose. Failed authorizations should result in an alarm or at least a timed lockout to prevent experimenting with possible codes. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. This feature is useful for permitting a single door to be opened and closed before the alarm is armed, or to permit a person to leave, but not return. High-end systems allow multiple access codes, and may even permit them to be used only once, or on particular days, or only in combination with other users' codes (i.e., escorted). In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. As with access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery. Fire sensors can be isolated, meaning that when triggered, they will not trigger the main alarm network. This is important when smoke and heat is intentionally produced. The owners of buildings can be fined for generating false alarms that waste the time of emergency personnel. ==False and absent alarms== The United States Department of Justice estimates that between 94% and 98% of all alarm calls to law enforcement are false alarms. System reliability and user error are the cause of most false alarms, sometimes called \\"nuisance alarms.\\" False alarms can be very costly to local governments, local law enforcement, security system users and members of local communities. In 2007, the Department of Justice reported that in just one year, false alarms cost local municipalities and their constituents at least $1.8 billion. In many municipalities across the United States, policies have been adopted to fine home and business owners for multiple false alarm activations from their security system. If multiple false alarms from the same property persist, that property could even be added to a \\"no response\\" list, which bars police dispatch to the property except in the event of verified emergency. Approximately 1% of police alarm calls actually involve a crime. Nuisance alarms occur when an unintended event evokes an alarm status by an otherwise properly working alarm system. A false alarm also occurs when there is an alarm system malfunction that results in an alarm state. In all three circumstances, the source of the problem should be immediately found and fixed, so that responders will not lose confidence in the alarm reports. It is easier to know when there are false alarms, because the system is designed to react to that condition. Failure alarms are more troublesome because they usually require periodic testing to make sure the sensors are working and that the correct signals are getting through to the monitor. Some systems are designed to detect problems internally, such as low or dead batteries, loose connections, phone circuit trouble, etc. While earlier nuisance alarms could be set off by small disturbances, like insects or pets, newer model alarms have technology to measure the size/weight of the object causing the disturbance, and thus are able to decide how serious the threat is, which is especially useful in burglar alarms. ==False alarm reduction== Many municipalities across the United States require alarm verification before police are dispatched. Under this approach, alarm monitoring companies must verify the legitimacy of alarms (except holdup, duress, and panic alarms) before calling the police. Verified response typically involves visual on- scene verification of a break-in, or remote audio or video verification. Home and business owners can now choose a new type of keypad control panel designed to help reduce false alarms. Based on a standard called CP-01-2000, developed by the American National Standards Institute and Security Industry Association, the new generation of keypad control panels takes aim at user error by building in extra precautions that minimize unwarranted dispatch of emergency responders. Some of the features of CP-01 keypads include a progress annunciation function that emits a different sound during the last 10 seconds of delay, which hastens exit from the premises. Also, the exit time doubles if the user disables the pre-warning feature. Other \\"rules\\" address failure to exit premises, which results in arming all zones in Stay Mode and a one-time, automatic restart of exit delay. However, if there is an exit error, an immediate local alarm will sound. ==Audio and video verification== Alarms that utilize either audio, video, or combination of both audio and video verification technology give security companies, dispatchers, police officers, and property managers more reliable data to assess the threat level of a triggered alarm. Audio and video verification techniques use microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, usually an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the central station where monitors retrieve the images through proprietary software. The information is then relayed to law enforcement and recorded to an event file, which can be used to plan a more strategical and tactical approach of a property, and later as prosecution evidence. An example of how this system works is when a passive infrared or other sensor is triggered a designated number of video frames from before and after the event is sent to the central station. A second video solution can be incorporated into a standard panel, which sends the central station an alarm. When a signal is received, a trained monitoring professional accesses the on- site digital video recorder (DVR) through an IP link to determine the cause of the activation. For this type of system, the camera input to the DVR reflects the alarm panel's zones and partitioning, which allows personnel to look for an alarm source in multiple areas. The United States Department of Justice states that legislation requiring alarm companies to verify the legitimacy of an alarm, before contacting law enforcement (commonly known as \\"verified response\\") is the most effective way to reduce false burglar alarms. The Department of Justice considers audio, video, or an eye-witness account as verification for the legitimacy of a burglar alarm. ==Cross-zoning== Cross- zoning is a strategy that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one area, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the customer. A second alarm signal‚Äîreceived in an adjacent zone within a short time‚Äîis the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window. ==Enhanced call verification== Enhanced call verification (ECV) helps reduce false dispatches 25‚Äì50% while still protecting citizens, and is mandated in several US jurisdictions, although the alarm industry has successfully opposed it in others. ECV requires central station personnel to attempt to verify the alarm activation by making a minimum of two phone calls to two different responsible party telephone numbers before dispatching law enforcement to the scene. The first alarm-verification call goes to the location the alarm originated. If contact with a person is not made, a second call is placed to a different number. The secondary number, best practices dictate, should be to a telephone that is answered even after hours, preferably a cellular phone of a decision maker authorized to request or bypass emergency response. ECV, as it cannot confirm an actual intrusion event and will not prompt a priority law enforcement dispatch, is not considered true alarm verification by the security industry. ==Independent certification== Some insurance companies and local agencies require that alarm systems be installed to code or be certified by an independent third party. The alarm system is required to have a maintenance check carried out every 6 ‚Äì 12 months (in the UK, 'Audible Only' intruder alarm systems require a routine service visit once every 12 months and monitored intruder alarm systems require a check twice in every 12-month period) to ensure all internal components, sensors and PSUs are functioning correctly. In the past, this would require an alarm service engineer to attend site and carry the checks out. With the use of the Internet or radio path and a compatible IP/radio transmitting device (at the alarmed premises), some checks can now be carried out remotely from the central station. ==See also== *Access control *Alarm management *Door security *Dual loop *Emergency service *Environmental design *Fire alarm *Glass-break detector *Perimeter intrusion detection system *Physical security *Security lighting *Vandal-resistant switch *Voice- activated radio-dispatched alarm ==References== ==Sources== *Trimmer, H.

FFL publishes a biannual magazine, The American Feminist, and aims to reach young women, college students in particular. FFL's anti-abortion positions have been criticized by some traditional feminists. Katha Pollitt, columnist for The Nation, argues that FFL seeks to make abortion illegal in all cases, including those of rape, incest, health, major fetal defects, and \\"even some abortions most doctors would say were necessary to save the woman's life\\".Katha Pollitt, \\"Feminists for (Fetal) Life\\", The Nation, Aug. 11, 2005. ==Methods== FFL uses \\"pro-women\\" language in order to convince women that abortion is \\"immoral\\". They use the \\"pro-woman\\" term as a substitute for \\"feminist\\", while at the same time opposing mainstream feminism. FFL holds that abortion is antithetical to feminism. Goltz argued that the legalization of abortion allowed sexually exploitative men to avoid responsibilities such as paying for child support.Ziegler, M. (2013). Women's Rights on the Right: The History and Stakes of Modern Pro-Life Feminism. Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law Justice28(2), 232-268. FFL argues that abortion comes from gender inequality. In response to Roe v. Wade, Callaghan made several claims, including that abortion causes bodily injury to women \\"in a third to a half of the cases\\", and that the Supreme Court legalized abortion because they \\"hate poor and unwed mothers\\". Professor Kelsy Kretschmer said these claims are unsubstantiated, but that the FFL uses such claims to undermine the idea that legal abortion is a feminist \\"victory\\". ==History== ===Origins=== Feminists for Life was founded by Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan in Ohio in 1972. Goltz and Callaghan met in a judo club on the campus of Ohio State University, where Callaghan was a tenured professor of linguistics. In 1974, Goltz was expelled from the Columbus, Ohio, chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) for arguing that abortion violated feminist principles,Dennis Doyle, \\"Catholic Social Teaching and Movements\\", The Church Emerging from Vatican II: A Popular Approach to Contemporary Catholicism (1992), p.212. although she and Callaghan were not expelled from national NOW membership. ===Mid-1970s=== After five years as president of FFL, Goltz retired. In 1977, organizational management was moved to Wisconsin. The group's activities focused on being a presence at both anti-abortion and feminist events, distributing literature, and writing letters to various publications. A national workshop that became an annual conference for anti-abortion feminists was launched during this time. Many members supported both the Equal Rights Amendment and a Human Life Amendment as \\"complementary in their concern for human life\\".\\"Reflecting as FFL Celebrates Its Tenth Birthday\\" and \\"HLA and ERA‚ÄîInedible Alphabet Soup?\\" in Pro-Life Feminism: Different Voices, , pp. 17, 35 ===1980s=== In June 1984, at the annual FFL meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, peace activist Rachel MacNair was elected president of FFL. Out of her office at a crisis pregnancy center in Kansas City, Missouri, she ran FFL for ten years. Under MacNair, FFL began to receive more national exposure through media interviews, involvement in a broad spectrum of anti-abortion issues, and invitations to speak at anti- abortion events. By 1989, FFL was reporting that their research had found statements against abortion that had been made by early feminists. Some of these findings were challenged by specialists in women's history, especially in the case of Susan B. Anthony, leading to a public dispute about her views on abortion. During 1992, MacNair also worked toward founding the Susan B. Anthony List as a political action committee working against abortion through electing anti-abortion candidates. ===1990s=== In the 1990s, FFL worked within the anti-abortion movement but they used \\"pro-woman\\" language to establish a \\"feminist\\" identity separate from both feminists and anti-abortion activists. Professor Laury Oaks noted that, in practice, their actions revealed a \\"pro- life stance\\" from which they attacked mainstream feminism. They backed laws which limited access to abortion. FFL did not usually state that their group's ultimate goal was to outlaw abortion, but they supported radical activism in Operation Rescue's effort to blockade abortion clinics by filing amicus curiae briefs in the 1993 Supreme Court case Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic. FFL also supported two attempts in the 1990s to enact a \\"partial- birth\\" abortion ban, both of which were vetoed by President Bill Clinton. In 1994‚Äì1995 after MacNair stepped down as leader, FFL's office was moved to Washington, D.C., and reorganized as a more politically pragmatic operation under Serrin Foster. Foster began in 1994 to visit college campuses where she spoke out against abortion. This effort was expanded in 1996 to a college outreach campaign involving all of FFL. In 1999 the FFL proposed that the Violence Against Women Act should not allow abortions of pregnancies from rape. ===2000s=== In mid-2005, the Woodward Building, which housed the offices of Feminists for Life, the National Organization for Women, and The Hill newspaper, among others,Woodward Building, 733 15th St NW DC.

Retrieved September 24, 2010. ===Contraception=== FFL states that its members and supporters \\"hold a broad spectrum of opinions\\" about contraception,Martin, Michel. \\"Women's Group Advocates For Abortion Alternatives\\" on Tell Me More, National Public Radio, January 22, 2010. with FFL taking no official position on the matter.\\"Feminists for Life Thrilled to See Sarah Palin as Vice Presidential Nominee\\", Catholic News Agency, 29 August 2008 (\\"Palin...is in support of contraception, a position that lies beyond the scope of FFL‚Äôs mission, Ms. Foster said.\\")\\"The Battle to Ban Birth Control\\", Salon, Mar. 20, 2006 (\\"Feminists for Life refused interview requests ... [because] contraception lies outside of its purview\\".) Prominent FFL member Sarah Palin stated in 2006, \\"I'm pro-contraception, and I think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues\\".Mehta, Seema, \\"GOP Ticket Split Over Condom Use\\", Los Angeles Times, 6 September 2008. Some commentators have criticized FFL for not promoting contraception. Katha Pollitt says that she asked Serrin Foster about it, and that Foster replied in part that the Pill did not work for teenagers, which Pollitt said was a belief she knew to be false. Feminist scholar Laury Oaks pointed out that FFL's silence on the subjects of contraception and safer sex \\"fails to address some of the most critical sexual and reproductive issues for women and presents views on pregnancy that cannot encompass the reality of many women's experiences\\". ==The American Feminist== FFL publishes a biannual magazine called The American Feminist which includes original and reprinted articles. ==College Outreach program== Susan B. Anthony image and quoted text, used by FFL to portray her as \\"anti-choice\\". The quote deals with child custody in estate law rather than abortion. In 1994, Foster began to visit college campuses to deliver her speech \\"The Feminist Case Against Abortion\\". FFL established a college outreach program in 1996. For a college audience, FFL designed a promotional campaign that challenged abortion rights advocacy and provided information for pregnant women, not including how to obtain an abortion. FFL members created several kits for student activists, a kit for residential advisers and psychological counselors, a feminist history kit for libraries, and challenging ads for college audiences, in addition to the resources available through FFL's website.\\"The Feminist Case Against Abortion\\" was included in the Women's Rights anthology of the Great Speeches in History book series (2001, ). Two of the eight \\"Question Abortion\\" posters offered in 2000 touched upon political issues, one of these saying \\"No law can make the wrong choice right\\". One poster used an image of Susan B. Anthony and an out-of- context paraphrased quote determined two years earlier by FFL historian Mary Krane Derr to be about estate law, not abortion. Other posters recast choice as the \\"imperative to have an abortion\\", or implied that life was better before abortion rights, back when abortion was illegal. Other FFL posters reveal an anti-abortion stance even in case of rape or incest. One of the goals of the college program is to get members of college campuses to help advocate for student parenting as a way to reduce the prevalence of abortion. This is an example of \\"common ground\\" advocacy. Both sides of the abortion issues are coming together in attempt to work together to find solutions for other issues relating to abortion.Joffe, C. (1997). Abortion as single-issue politics. Society, 34(5), 25-29. FFL believes that there should be daycares on college campuses', dorm housing for women with children, and maternity coverage in health insurances.BAILEY, C. (2006). \\"Taking Back the Campus\\": Right-Wing Feminism as the \\"Middle Ground\\" Feminist Teacher, 16(3), 173-188. They blame abortion rights activists for failing to secure provisions that would help make motherhood an easier choice for women. ==\\"Women Deserve Better\\" campaign== FFL supported the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Students Act, which was criticized by writer Emily Bazelon in Mother Jones as a \\"largely hollow 'message bill'\\".Bazelon, Emily (January‚ÄìFebruary 2007) \\"Suffragette City: Pro-life Feminists.\\" Mother Jones, Politics, Current Affairs. Retrieved on January 12, 2010. Bazelon opined that the 10 million dollars provided by the bill would be \\"paltry\\" when spread nationwide. Bazelon quoted Frances Kissling, leader of the abortion rights organization Catholics for a Free Choice, as calling the bill \\"not serious\\", and adding that \\"if we support these message bills that don't really give women much help, then the real message we send is that we're not strongly committed to women\\". ==References to 19th century feminists== Suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (seated) and Susan B. Anthony FFL's website features what are said to be quotes from several early feminists, some of which have been challenged by specialists in women's history. The quotes attributed to Anthony led to a dispute about her views on abortion. Much of the dispute centered on an anonymous article called \\"Marriage and Maternity\\" published in 1869 in Anthony's newspaper and signed \\"A\\". Anonymously written articles were common in The Revolution, which published a variety of viewpoints. The author of this article used fervent religious language and called abortion \\"child-murder\\". Pro-Life Feminism, a book published in 1995 by FFL leaders, said that Susan B. Anthony was the \\"A\\" who wrote the article. The article was reprinted under the heading \\"'A Dreadful Volume of Heart-Histories' by Susan B. Anthony\\". The authors said in an endnote that it was signed \\"A\\" but provided reasons for believing that it was written by Anthony. Ann Dexter Gordon, an academic expert on Anthony, disagreed, saying that Anthony did not sign her writings as \\"A\\" and that \\"many of the ideas expressed in the article clash with her known beliefs.\\" Another article in The Revolution that was signed \\"A\\" took issue with one of its editorials, generating a discussion in which the editors referred its author as \\"Mr. A.\\" FFL cites the writings of Stanton as supposedly opposing abortion, using her image many times on posters, flyers and other media. However, Stanton was a radical activist bent on reforming religious and society norms in order to halt the subjugation of women. She stayed out of the American Medical Association-generated debate about enacting laws against abortion, and she never voiced support for the criminalization of abortion or the restriction of women's right to choose. Instead, she advocated that women should always be allowed to choose when to have children, and how many to have ‚Äì an approach which she called \\"voluntary motherhood.\\" She assisted in the defense of poor women who were accused of killing their infants after birth, the most famous case being Hester Vaughn. Stanton was consistent in her belief that every woman should be the sole person to choose whether and how often she participated in childbearing. Stanton herself was a likely practitioner of contraception to enable family planning, and she was an opponent of the Comstock laws restricting education about contraception and abortion. Stanton helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, and she was responsible for putting women's right to vote on the list of convention demands. Regarding the 1868 \\"Child Murder\\" article in the Revolution, from which FFL takes a supposed Stanton quote, Gordon concluded that Stanton was not the author of this article, saying its \\"flat style\\" does not match Stanton's. Rather, it was likely written by Revolution co-editor Parker Pillsbury who used that same style in other articles. Thomas said that Pillsbury performed most of the day-to-day editorial activities for the newspaper because Stanton was away on speaking tours for much of the year, sending in her articles by mail. ==Prominent members== In 2007, Foster noted that FFL had reached 26,000 members, including the families of women who joined. During the confirmation hearings for John Roberts, his position on abortion was questioned in light of his wife's FFL membership, leading to intensified focus by the media on the group. Sarah Palin, the first woman to be nominated by the Republican Party for Vice President of the United States and the first female governor of Alaska, has been a FFL member since 2006.\\"Abortion Draws Clear Divide in State Races\\", Juneau Empire, accessed Aug. 29, 2008\\"Governor‚Äôs Race: Top Contenders Meet One Last Time to Debate\\", Anchorage Daily News, Nov. 3, 2006.\\"Same-sex Unions, Drugs Get Little Play\\" , Anchorage Daily News, Aug. 6, 2006 ==Susan B.

He is also a songwriter, pianist, arranger and producer. ==Early life and early career== Hatch was born in Pinner, Middlesex. Encouraged by his musical abilities, his mother ‚Äì also a pianist ‚Äì enrolled him in the London Choir School in Wansunt Road, Bexley, Kent when he was 10. Instead of continuing at the Royal Academy of Music, he left school in 1955 and found a job with Robert Mellin Music in London's Tin Pan Alley. Not long after working as a tea boy, he was writing songs (under the name Mark Anthony) and entered the recording industry when he joined The Rank Organisation's new subsidiary Top Rank Records; there he worked for future Decca Records A&R; man Dick Rowe. While he served his National Service, he became involved with the Band of the Coldstream Guards. On his return in 1959, Hatch began producing Top Rank artists such as Bert Weedon, the then unknown Adam Faith (\\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\\"), Josh MacRae (together with MacRae's early recordings with Scottish folk trio The Reivers), Jackie Dennis, Carry On comedy actor Kenneth Connor, and The Knightsbridge Strings, and started his own recording career with a cover version of Russ Conway's piano instrumental \\"Side Saddle\\". Though he used his real name Tony Hatch as a performer and producer, through about 1964 virtually all his compositions were credited to Mark Anthony. In 1960, Garry Mills's recording of the Mark Anthony composition \\"Look for a Star\\", featured in the film Circus of Horrors, became a Top Ten hit in the UK for Top Rank. Four versions of the song charted simultaneously in the United States, including Mills' original and a version by 'Garry Miles' (a recording alias of future member of The Crickets, Buzz Cason). Top Rank, despite some worldwide success with artists such as Jack Scott and The Fireballs, ultimately failed because of an unusual distribution arrangement with EMI. A swift succession of events ensued through 1961 that Top Rank was sold to EMI, briefly operated as a subsidiary, with hits by John Leyton, and shuttered, with its artists transferred to other EMI labels. Hatch moved on to a part-time job with Pye Records, where he assisted his new mentor, Alan A. Freeman, with the recording of \\"Sailor\\", a number 1 hit for Petula Clark. As Mark Anthony, Hatch continued to write songs for Pye artists, including \\"Messing About on the River\\" for Josh MacRae. In 1963, Philadelphia teen idol Bobby Rydell hit the charts with \\"Forget Him\\" written and produced by Hatch (still writing as Mark Anthony); Hatch produced, arranged and wrote for other American stars such as Chubby Checker, Connie Francis, Pat Boone, Big Dee Irwin and Keely Smith. In 1964 he wrote (under the pseudonym of Fred Nightingale) the Searchers' hit \\"Sugar and Spice\\". By mid-1964, Hatch finally began using his own name as a composer regularly, with Tony Hatch being the credited composer of many of Petula Clark's biggest mid-1960s hits, including \\"Downtown\\", \\"I Know a Place\\", and \\"Sign of the Times\\", among others. In November 1965, Hatch performed with David Bowie (then known as Davy Jones) in the band the Lower Third, in an unsuccessful audition for the BBC's Talent Selection Group. The band weren't picked up for broadcast, with one member of the judging panel commenting \\"I don‚Äôt think they'll get better with more rehearsals.\\" While at Pye, he produced many of their artists: the Searchers, David Bowie, Mark Wynter, the Settlers, the Viscounts, Julie Grant, Gary Miller, Benny Hill, the Overlanders, Roy Budd, the Brook Brothers, Jimmy Justice, the Montanas, Miki & Griff, Emile Ford, Craig Douglas, Bruce Forsyth, Sue Nicholls, the Breakaways, Norman Vaughan, Buddy Greco, Sacha Distel, Anne Shelton, Sweet Sensation, David Parton, and Graduate among others. His production of The Searchers' entire Pye catalogue was significant in that nearly every song was issued in true stereo. The only other UK chart acts with so much stereo were George Martin producing The Beatles and Ron Richards producing The Hollies (although a handful of early Hollies albums were initially issued only in mono). Hatch also recorded various lounge style albums with his orchestra; he also made solo piano recordings and some tracks as a vocalist. ==Collaboration with Petula Clark== After \\"Valentino\\", the first of Hatch's compositions to be recorded by Petula Clark, he became her regular producer. They collaborated on a series of French-language recordings for Vogue Records. (Clark, whose husband was French and who spoke the language fluently, had a successful career throughout Europe.) Hatch became one of her regular songwriting partners, in addition to supplying English lyrics for songs she had composed with French lyricists. In 1964 Hatch made his first trip to New York City in search of new material for Clark. The visit inspired him to write \\"Downtown\\", originally with The Drifters in mind. When Clark heard the still unfinished tune, she told him that if he could write lyrics to match the quality of the music, she would record the song as her next single. Its release transformed her into a huge international star, topping charts globally early in 1965, and introducing her to the US market. \\"Downtown\\" peaked at number two in Britain, stuck behind the Beatles' great hit \\"I Feel Fine\\". Clark then charted with three consecutive hits written by Hatch: \\"I Know a Place\\", \\"You'd Better Come Home\\", and \\"Round Every Corner\\", which all charted higher in the US than in the UK. She and Hatch co-wrote \\"You're The One\\", which peaked at 22 in Britain but which gave The Vogues a major debut hit in the States. Tony Hatch and Petula Clark became established as the British equivalent of Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick. In 1965 Hatch's first album under his own name was released. The Downtown Sound of Tony Hatch, features instrumental versions of some of his best known songs, along with new compositions. The song \\"Call Me\\", written for and recorded by Petula Clark in 1965, was recorded by Chris Montez later in the year. Released in November 1965, Montez's version entered the US Easy Listening Top 40 in Billboard that December, and the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1966, peaking that March on the Easy Listening chart at #2 and on the Hot 100 at #22. Petula Clark's run of 1966 and 1967 hits include many written by Hatch: \\"My Love\\" (a US number one), \\"A Sign of the Times\\", \\"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\\", \\"Who Am I\\", \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\", \\"Colour My World\\", and \\"The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener\\". He wrote all of these (except \\"My Love\\") with his wife Jackie Trent. \\"A Sign of the Times\\", \\"Who Am I\\" and \\"Colour My World\\" were not hits in Britain. ==Collaboration with Jackie Trent and later career== In 1964, Hatch was hired to write his first television theme, for the soap opera Crossroads. It would become one of his best-known compositions, and was re-worked by Paul McCartney and Wings. He would continue to write television themes throughout the 1960s, including the themes to Man Alive, The Champions, and The Doctors. When asked to write a song to be featured in the Inspector Rose series, It's Dark Outside, he supplied \\"Where Are You Now?\\", with lyrics and vocals by a recently signed Pye artist, Jackie Trent. The song immediately clicked with the public and shot to number 1 in the charts. Though still married to his first wife, Hatch began an affair with Jackie Trent, who had become a frequent songwriting collaborator. This ongoing affair was the inspiration for the song \\"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\\". Hatch and Trent married in 1967. Their duet \\"The Two Of Us\\" reached number three in the Australian charts in 1967 and created a demand for concert and cabaret performances earning the duo the nickname of \\"Mr & Mrs Music\\". The couple also wrote the song \\"Joanna\\", a hit for Scott Walker. One of their more unusual collaborations was the song \\"We'll Be With You\\" written for Stoke City Football Club in the club's successful run for the League Cup in 1972. The song featured the team and supporters and was recorded at the supporters club using Pye's mobile studio. The song is still sung by fans as the team runs out on matchdays. During the 1970s, Hatch and Trent diversified into musical theatre. Their first project, The Card, based on Arnold Bennett's novel, with book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, ran in London's West End with Jim Dale and Millicent Martin in the lead roles. (Coincidentally, Petula Clark had starred in the 1952 film version with Alec Guinness.) An original cast album was released in 1975. A rewritten version of the show, starring Peter Duncan and Hayley Mills, played the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in the 1990s and spawned a new cast album. The second Hatch/Trent musical was Rock Nativity, with book and lyrics by David Wood. Initiated and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, it first played in Newcastle. An updated version of the show toured nationally in 1976 and was broadcast nationally by Scottish TV. A full-length concert version was recorded at the Cork Opera House for the Irish television state broadcaster RT√â. In 1972, he composed the original theme to Emmerdale Farm, as well as the themes to Hadleigh and Sportsnight. During the 1970s Hatch was also a regular panellist on the talent show New Faces where his blunt style of assessing the contestants has proved to be a forerunner of approaches to come in later, similar series. After completing the music score to the movie Sweeney 2 (1978), Hatch and Trent moved to Dublin, where they remained for four years, hosting their own TV series, Words And Music and It's A Musical World. Hatch continued to produce hit TV themes for series such as Seagull Island and Airline before moving to Australia in 1982. While there, the couple wrote one of their best known compositions, the theme for the TV soap opera Neighbours. Hatch produced the Original Australian Cast Recording of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats in 1985, whilst serving as the show's production musical director. Hatch and Trent separated in 1995, and divorced in 2002. Trent died on 21 March 2015 in Menorca after a long illness. ==Other later events== In 2003, a disco remix of the original recording of \\"Downtown\\" was released in Australia by The OUTsiDER with the blessing of both Hatch and Clark and became a hit. A souvenir CD box set of six of Hatch's albums (four from the 1960s and two from the 1970s ‚Äì including one with Jackie Trent), was released in 2005. Hatch performed at the Hackney Empire on 9 September 2012, for a Grand Order of Water Rats evening - 'The Golden Years of Variety'. At the piano he played the theme tunes of Emmerdale Farm, Neighbours, and Crossroads and encouraged a sing-along to \\"Downtown\\". On 13 June 2013, Hatch was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, at a ceremony held at the New York Marriott Marquis. He was accompanied by his wife, Maggie. Hatch performed in October 2016 at the inaugural Variety Hall of Fame Awards, with Petula Clark, and hosting \\"As Heard on TV\\" on BBC Radio 2 on 1 November 2016. Hatch was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity. ==Family life== Hatch has two daughters from his first marriage to Jean, Sharon and Amanda as well as a son, Darren and daughter Michelle from his marriage to Jackie Trent. He now has two stepchildren too with his wife Maggie Hatch - Alex and Charlie. He lives in Menorca, Spain, with his third wife, Maggie. ==Selected compositions== ===Film and television=== *1962: Stork Talk (Film) *1964: Crossroads (TV) *1965: Man Alive (TV) *1968: The Champions (TV) *1969: Who- Dun-It (TV) *1969: The Doctors (TV) *1972: Travels with My Aunt (Film) *1972: Emmerdale Farm (TV) *1972: Mr & Mrs (TV) *1973: Hadleigh (TV) *1973: Love Story (TV) *1973: Sportsnight (TV) *1977: Backs to the Land (TV) *1978: Sweeney 2 (Film) *1981: Seagull Island (TV) *1982: Airline (TV) *1983: Waterloo Station (TV) *1985: Neighbours (TV) ==See also== *:Category:Songs written by Tony Hatch ==References== ==External links== * *Spectropop: Tony Hatch * * Category:1939 births Category:English musical theatre composers Category:English pianists Category:English jazz pianists Category:English songwriters Category:English television composers Category:English male composers Category:Living people Category:English record producers Category:British music arrangers Category:English expatriates in Spain Category:English expatriates in Australia Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Pinner Category:British male pianists Category:21st-century pianists Category:21st-century British male musicians Category:British male jazz musicians Category:Easy listening musicians ","title":"Tony Hatch"},{"id":"1294836","text":"Op√©ration Turquoise was a French-led military operation in Rwanda in 1994 under the mandate of the United Nations. == Background == On 6 April 1994 Rwandan President Juv√©nal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira were assassinated, sparking the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. The United Nations already had a peacekeeping force, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), in Kigali that had been tasked with observing that the Arusha Accords were being carried out. Following the start of the genocide and the murder of several kidnapped Belgian soldiers, Belgium withdrew its contribution to UNAMIR, which was commanded by Canadian Rom√©o Dallaire; Dallaire was prohibited from involving the force in the protection of civilians. By late April, several of the non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) were trying to convince the major powers to agree to a UNAMIR II. As opposed to UNAMIR, which had a peacekeeping mandate under Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter, UNAMIR II would be authorised under Chapter VII to enable the UN to prevent further harm. The French had provided the Hutu-dominated Habyarimana government with extensive military, and diplomatic support, including a military intervention to save the government during an offensive by the rebel Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in 1990. Immediately after the genocide began, the RPF began another offensive to overthrow the genocidal government and steadily gained ground. By late June, the RPF controlled much of the country and was nearing a complete victory. RPF units carried out retributive attacks within areas they controlled, but they were not of the scale and organization as those carried out in the genocide. ==Implementation== French parachutists, part of the international military force supporting the Rwandan relief effort, stand guard at the airport. On 19 June, the French government made an announcement of their intentions to organize, establish, and maintain a \\"safe zone\\" in the south-west of Rwanda. At the brink of defeat and retreat, the news of an intervention from their allies was broadcast across the country by the genocidaires, with a consequent increase in their confidence, and the continuation of their hunt for genocide survivors.Dallaire, Shake Hands with the Devil, p. 426. The French said the objectives of Op√©ration Turquoise were: On 20 June, France sent a draft resolution to the UNSC for authorization of Operation Turquoise under a two-month Chapter VII mandate. After two days of consultations and the personal approval of the U.N. Secretary General, it was adopted as Resolution 929 (1994), on 22 June, with 10 votes of approval and five abstentions. The \\"multilateral\\" force consisted of 2,500 troops, only 32 of them being from Senegal and the rest French. The equipment included 100 APCs, 10 helicopters, a battery of 120 mm mortars, 4 Jaguar fighter bombers, 8 Mirage fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft.Caplan, Gerard, Pambazuka News 142: Rwanda Ten Years After the Genocide: Some Reminders of the International Response to the Crisis , Pambazuka News, 5 February 2004 The helicopters were intended to lay a trail of food, water and medicine. The area that was selected ended up with the result that refugees were enabled to escape predominantly westward, into eastern Zaire. The zone affected by Operation Turquoise was changed after 2 members of a French reconnaissance unit were captured by the victorious RPF rebels and were released in exchange for a revision in the area of Operation Turquoise. There was an evacuation of the population westward, enforced by the Hutu regime, now set to flee from the Tutsi rebels, after it had been made clear the French were only there to provide a \\"safe zone\\", rather than assistance in the conflict. Unfortunately, there were roadblocks and checkpoints along the way, and the Tutsis left alive, and even Hutus without ID cards, were killed.Dallaire, Shake Hands with the Devil, p. 439. The outflow of refugees exacerbated the already great numbers of refugees in the region, known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis spilling out of Rwanda, and neighbouring Hutu-Tutsi Burundi, predominantly into Zaire. Approximately, 2.1 million people lived in Zaire in refugee camps. The militarization of these camps led to the invasion of Zaire by Rwanda and Uganda, known as the First Congo War. The area of French influence, known as Zone Turquoise, within the Cyangugu-Kibuye-Gikongoro triangle, was spread across a fifth of the country. Rwanda: ‚ÄòGenocidal slaughter‚Äô claims as many as 1 million ‚Äî UN authorises ‚ÄòOperation Turquoise‚Äô to protect displaced persons, UN Chronicle, Vol 4 (1994) Although it was meant to save lives and stop the mass killings, killings did occur. When the Hutu government moved the Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille-Collines radio transmitter, a key tool in encouraging Hutus to kill their Tutsi neighbors, into the Zone Turquoise, the French did not seize it. The radio broadcast from Gisenyi, calling on \\"you Hutu girls to wash yourselves and put on a good dress to welcome our French allies. The Tutsi girls are all dead, so you have your chance.\\" The French did not detain the government officials they knew had helped coordinate the genocide. When asked to explain that in the French parliament, the French foreign minister of the time argued that the UN mandate given to the French contained no authorization to investigate or arrest suspected war criminals.cf , fichier auditio1.rtf, p.94 Regardless, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand claimed that the Operation had saved \\"tens of thousands of lives\\".Power, A Problem from Hell, p. 380 The force left as the mandate of the operation expired on 21 August. The RPF immediately occupied the region, causing another refugee outflow. == Controversy == Op√©ration Turquoise is controversial for two reasons: accusations that it was a failed attempt to prop up the genocidal Hutu regime and that its mandate undermined the UNAMIR. The RPF, well aware that French assistance to the government had helped blunt their 1990 offensive, opposed the deployment of a French-led force. By early June, the RPF had managed to sweep through the eastern half of the country and move south and west, while besieging Kigali in the center. The advance resulted in a massive refugee outflow, though the Hutu government was also implicated in encouraging the flight (see Great Lakes refugee crisis.) Regardless, the Zone Turquoise was created in the steadily shrinking areas out of RPF control. The RPF was one of many organisations that noted that the French initiative to safeguard the populace was occurring six weeks after it had become apparent mass killings were occurring in Rwanda. On 22 July, French Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur addressed the Security Council, stating that France had a \\"moral duty\\" to act without delay and that \\"without swift action, the survival of an entire country was at stake and the stability of a region seriously compromised.\\" In May 2006, the Paris Court of Appeal accepted six courtsuits deposed by victims of the genocide to magistrate Brigitte Reynaud. The charges raised against the French army during Operation Turquoise from June to August 1994 are of \\"complicity of genocide and/or complicity of crimes against humanity.\\" The victims allege that French soldiers engaged in Operation Turquoise helped Interahamwe militias in finding their victims, and have themselves carried out atrocities.\\"Validation des plaintes visant l'arm√©e fran√ßaise au Rwanda.\\" Press Release. Reuters.Online posting. Lib√©ration France 29 May 2006. The former Rwandan ambassador to France and co-founder of the RPF Jacques Bihozagara testified, \\"Operation Turquoise was aimed only at protecting genocide perpetrators, because the genocide continued even within the Turquoise zone.\\" France has always denied any role in the killing.\\"France accused on Rwanda killings\\", BBC News, 24 October 2006 UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire had also opposed the deployment, having sent extensive communication back to U.N. Headquarters that the placement of two U.N.-authorised commands with different mandates and command structures into the same country was problematic. Dallaire was also a strong proponent of strengthening UNAMIR and transitioning it to a Chapter VII mandate, rather than introducing a new organisation. Concern over conflicting mandates led to five countries on the UNSC to abstain in the vote approving the force. The UN-sponsored \\"Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda\\" found it \\"unfortunate that the resources committed by France and other countries to Operation Turquoise could not instead have been put at the disposal of UNAMIR II.\\" On 21 June, Dallaire replaced 42 UNAMIR peacekeepers from Francophone Congo, Senegal and Togo with UN staff from Kenya after the negative reaction of the RPF to Op√©ration Turquoise. Over the two months of the mandate, there were confrontations, and risk of confrontations, between RPF and French-led units around the zone, during which UNAMIR was asked to convey messages between the two. The UN independent inquiry drily noted that this was \\"a role which must be considered awkward to say the least.\\" ==Notes on the text== ==References== * * ==External links== *Human Rights Watch \\"Leave None to Tell the Story\\" Category:Rwandan genocide Category:Military operations involving France Category:1994 in Rwanda ","title":"Op√©ration Turquoise"},{"id":"1294841","text":"Mount Victoria may refer to either peaks or communities named after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. ==Peaks== ;In Australia: * Mount Victoria (Tasmania), Australia ; In Canada: * Mount Victoria (British Columbia), Canada, in the Jervist Inlet area of the British Columbia Coast * Mount Victoria (Bow Range), on the Alberta-British Columbia border ; In New Zealand: * Mount Victoria, Wellington, New Zealand (a hill, and a suburb of Wellington) * Mount Victoria, Auckland, New Zealand (a volcano) ;In Oceania and elsewhere: * Mount Victoria, Burma, also known as Nat Ma Taung, in western Myanmar/Burma * Mount Tomanivi, formerly Mount Victoria, in Fiji * Mount Victoria, Palawan, on Palawan island, Philippines * Mount Victoria, Papua New Guinea in the Owen Stanley Ranges ==Communities== * Mount Victoria, New South Wales, Australia * Mount Victoria, Maryland, United States ==Electoral districts== * Mount Victoria (New Zealand electorate), a former parliamentary electorate, 1946‚Äì1954 == See also == * Victoria Peak, Hong Kong ","title":"Mount Victoria"},{"id":"1294846","text":"Sight attached to an L85A2 The Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux, or SUSAT, is a 4√ó telescopic sight, with tritium-powered illumination utilised at dusk or dawn. The full name of the current model is the SUSAT L9A1. The sight is not designed as a sniper sight, but is rather intended to be mounted on a variety of rifles and to be used by all infantrymen. A similar device is the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight. ==Use== SUSAT was the primary sighting system for the British Army's SA80 series weapons and L108 and L110 light machine guns. It was phased out and replaced by ACOG and ELCAN sight units during mid-life upgrade programmes. As of March 2019 it is still in use with much of the UK armed forces due to budgetary constraints. It is (or has been) also used by the armies of Cameroon, Oman, Spain and Sweden, in assault rifles such as the Swedish Ak5B and the Spanish CETME LV, although after the replacement of the latter by the HK G36, those sights have been employed in Rheinmetall MG3 machine guns. A similar unit known as the L2A2 SUIT Sight was used on the L1A1 SLR. ==Reticle== View through a SUSAT. The reticle of the SUSAT is of unusual design. Unlike the traditional crosshair layouts commonly used, which are in essence a cross intersecting the target, the SUSAT has a single obelisk-shaped post protruding from the bottom edge of the sight. This type of reticle is sometimes referred to as the \\"German Post\\". This obscures the target at long range and the foreground. The reticle is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming. The radioactive tritium light source has to be replaced every 8‚Äì12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. The L2A2 SUIT Sight uses a similar single post to the SUSAT, but protrudes from the top edge of the sight down to the middle of the field. ==Manufacturing== SUSAT is constructed from a one-piece, pressure die-cast, aluminium body, into which the eyepiece, objective lens and prisms are fitted as assemblies. The SUSAT sight was developed in the United Kingdom by Royal Armament Research Development Establishment (RARDE) and is manufactured by United Scientific Instruments and Avimo, now known as Thales Optics. ==Specifications== SUSAT L9A1 *Overall dimensions: (L x W x H): 145 x 60 x 55 mm *Weight: 417 grams *Magnification: 4√ó *Field of view: 10 degrees (177 mils) *Objective diameter: 25,5 mm *Exit pupil: 6.375 mm *Eye relief: 25 mm *Light permeability: >80% *Reticle illumination: Red tritium, glass ampoule *Illumination strength: Adjustable *Tritium ampoule lifetime: 8‚Äì12 years *Focus: ‚àí0.75 to ‚àí1.25 dioptres *Operational temperature: ‚àí46 to +71 ¬∞C *Range Settings: 100 to 600 meters (SUSAT L9A1) or 300 to 800 meters (SUSAT L12A1) in 100 m intervals *NATO Stock Number (NSN): 1240-99-967-0947 (Sight Unit Small Arms Trilux (SUSAT) L12A1) ==See also== *C79 optical sight *ACOG Optical Sight *L2A2 SUIT Sight ==External links== *United Scientific Instruments‚ÄîOfficial website *SIGHT UNIT SMALL ARMS TRILUX (SUSAT) Category:Firearm sights Category:British Army equipment ","title":"SUSAT"},{"id":"1294850","text":"Natasha Shanta Reid (born May 31, 1981), better known by her Korean name Yoon Mi-rae (), is an American-born South Korean rapper and singer who is currently a member of Korean hip hop trio MFBTY. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Yoon was born on May 31, 1981, in Fort Hood, Texas to a South Korean mother and an African-American father. Her father had been a radio DJ while serving with the U.S. military in South Korea in the district of Uijeongbu. Yoon's father cites his record collection as an influence to pursue her music career. After she moved to South Korea as a child, she often faced discrimination because of her mixed heritage. Yoon dropped out of school at age 15 and later took a high school equivalence exam. ===Discovery and Uptown=== Yoon was discovered in 1995 when she accompanied a friend to an audition for a new Korean hip hop group. She did not audition herself, but a World Records representative heard her singing outside of the audition room and signed her to join a new group called Uptown. The group debuted in 1997 when Yoon was just 16. In 1999, she also formed hip hop and R&B; duo \\"Tashannie\\" with singer Annie. They released one album, called Parallel Prophecies. Yoon's name, Natasha, was hard for South Koreans to pronounce, so she used the name \\"Tasha,\\" in order to better appeal to the intended audience. Uptown broke up in 2000 after several group members were arrested on drug charges. Yoon's then-boyfriend, rapper Tiger JK, was also arrested and spent a month and a half in jail. Yoon herself went into hiding during that period. ===Solo career and MFBTY=== Yoon debuted as a solo artist in 2001, under the moniker \\"T\\" which she shortened even more from \\"Tasha\\". She released her first album, As Time Goes By that same year. Her second album, Gemini and her third album, To My Love, were released the following year in 2002. In 2006, she joined Jungle Entertainment, a label founded by her now-husband Tiger JK. The following year, she released the album T3 ‚Äì Yoon Mi Rae, on which she shared the difficulties she faced as a mixed race artist in Korea. That year, she performed in Seoul, South Korea with American singer Amerie, who is also of African-American and Korean heritage. In 2012, Yoon became the face of the computer brand Hewlett-Packard in Korea, having signed a one-year contract to appear in their print media and radio advertisements. She was also a judge on the third and fourth seasons of the television talent competition Superstar K. Yoon, Tiger JK and rapper Bizzy, formed the hip hop trio MFBTY (My Fans Better Than Yours) in 2013. The group's first single, \\"Sweet Dream,\\" ranked #1 on three Korean music charts shortly after its release. They had debuted the song at a concert in Cannes, France. MFBTY signed to Tiger JK's newly created Feel Ghood Music label later that year. In September 2013, Yoon earned the #1 spot on Billboard's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 list with her song \\"Touch Love\\" from the South Korean drama Master's Sun. In December 2014, Yoon released the single \\"Angel,\\" which quickly became #1 on four Korean music charts. Also that month she revealed that the American film The Interview used her song \\"Pay Day\\" without permission, and that she was taking legal action. ==Personal life== In June 2007, she married Tiger JK in a private ceremony in a Buddhist Temple. The wedding occurred a month before the death of Tiger JK's grandmother who had wanted to see them wed before her passing. Yoon gave birth to their son Jordan Seo in March 2008. Yoon and her husband are advocates against child abuse. In 2011, they appeared in a photoshoot with their son in Vogue Korea for the \\"Stop Child Abuse & Love Children\\" campaign. They also filmed a public service announcement for the World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse, performing at the 2011 Child Abuse Awareness Concert. In 2012, South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare commended the couple for their efforts in promoting child abuse prevention. Yoon has also promoted awareness of multiculturalism within Korean families. In 2008, she volunteered for seven months at a multicultural youth camp. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:5em;\\"  Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Sales - !

It is denoted mmHg or mm Hg. Although not an SI unit, the millimetre of mercury is still routinely used in medicine, meteorology, aviation, and many other scientific fields. One millimetre of mercury is approximately 1 Torr, which is of standard atmospheric pressure ( ‚âà ). Although the two units are not equal, the relative difference (less than ) is negligible for most practical uses. ==History and definition== Mercury manometers were the first accurate pressure gauges; they are less used today due to mercury's toxicity, the mercury column's sensitivity to temperature and local gravity, and the greater convenience of other instrumentation. They displayed the pressure difference between two fluids as a vertical difference between the mercury levels in two connected reservoirs. An actual mercury column reading may be converted to more fundamental units of pressure by multiplying the difference in height between two mercury levels by the density of mercury and the local gravitational acceleration. Because the specific weight of mercury depends on temperature and surface gravity, both of which vary with local conditions, specific standard values for these two parameters were adopted. This resulted in defining a \\"millimetre of mercury\\" as the pressure exerted at the base of a column of mercury 1 millimetre high with a precise density of when the acceleration due to gravity is exactly . The density chosen for this definition is the approximate density of mercury at , and is standard gravity. The use of an actual column of mercury to measure pressure normally requires correction for the density of mercury at the actual temperature and the sometimes marked variation of gravity with location, and may be further corrected to take account of the density of the measured air, water or other fluid. Each millimetre of mercury can be divided into 1000 micrometres of mercury, denoted ŒºmHg or simply microns. ==Relation to the torr== The precision of modern transducers is often insufficient to show the difference between the torr and the millimetre of mercury. The difference between these two units is about one part in seven million or . By the same factor, a millitorr is slightly less than a micrometre of mercury. ==Use in medicine and physiology== In medicine, pressure is still generally measured in millimetres of mercury. These measurements are in general given relative to the current atmospheric pressure: for example, a blood pressure of 120 mmHg, when the current atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg, means 880 mmHg relative to perfect vacuum. Routine pressure measurements in medicine include: * Blood pressure, measured with a sphygmomanometer * Intraocular pressure, with a tonometer * Cerebrospinal fluid pressure * Intracranial pressure * Intramuscular pressure (compartment syndrome) * Central venous pressure * Pulmonary artery catheterization * Mechanical ventilation In physiology manometric units are used to measure Starling forces. ==See also== * Bar (unit) * Inch of mercury * Inch of water * Pound per square inch * Torr ==References== Category:Units of pressure Category:Mercury (element) ","title":"Millimetre of mercury"},{"id":"1294857","text":"Bexley is an area of south-east London, England, sometimes known as Bexley Village.

The carvings date back as far as the 7th century AD, depicting and influenced by Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist beliefs. Some are in rock-cut cave shrines, in the usual Chinese Buddhist style, but many others are rock reliefs carved into the open rock faces. ==World Heritage Site== Listed as a World Heritage Site, the Dazu Rock Carvings are made up of 75 protected sites containing some 50,000 statues, with over 100,000 Chinese characters forming inscriptions and epigraphs. The sites are located in Chongqing Municipality within the steep hillsides throughout Dazu County, located about 165 kilometers west of the urban area of Chongqing. The highlights of the rock grotto are found on Mount Baoding and Mount Beishan. The carvings were listed as a World Heritage Site in 1999, citing \\"‚Ä¶their aesthetic quality, their rich diversity of subject matter, both secular and religious, and the light that they shed on everyday life in China during this period. They provide outstanding evidence of the harmonious synthesis of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.\\" ==History== The earliest carvings were begun in 650 AD during the early Tang dynasty, but the main period of their creation began in the late 9th century, when Wei Junjing, Prefect of Changzhou, pioneered the carvings on Mount Beishan, and his example was followed after the collapse of the Tang dynasty by local and gentry, monks and nuns, and ordinary people during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-65). In the 12th century, during the Song dynasty, a Buddhist monk named Zhao Zhifeng began work on the elaborate sculptures and carvings on Mount Baoding, dedicating 70 years of his life to the project. Off limits to visitors for many years, the carvings were opened to Chinese travellers in 1961 and foreign visitors in 1980. Until 1975, there was only a muddy path between the town of Dazu and the main cluster of carvings. The isolation helped keep the art unharmed during the massive anti-religious vandalism of the Cultural Revolution. ==Gallery== File:Dazu Stone Carving.jpgDazu rock carving on Mount Baoding.

A leading cleric in the Scottish Episcopal Church, he was Bishop of Brechin from 1847 until his death in 1875. ==Biography== St Drostan's Episcopal Church, Tarfside He was the second son of John Hay Forbes, Lord Medwyn, a judge of the court of session, and grandson of Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet of Pitsligo. He studied first at the Edinburgh Academy, then for two years under the Rev. Thomas Dale, the poet, in Kent, passed one session at Glasgow University in 1831 and, having chosen the career of the Indian Civil Service, completed his studies with distinction at the East India Company College. In 1836 he went to Madras and secured early promotion, but in consequence of ill health he was obliged to return to England. In 1840, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where in 1841, he obtained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship. He graduated with a B.A. in 1844. He was at Oxford during the early years of the movement known as Tractarianism, and was powerfully influenced by association with John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. This led him to resign his Indian appointment. In 1844 he was ordained deacon and priest in the Church of England, and held curacies at Aston Rowant and St Thomas's, Oxford; but being naturally attracted to the Episcopal Church of his native land, then recovering from long depression, he removed in 1846 to Stonehaven, the chief town of Kincardineshire. The same year, however, he was appointed to the vicarage of St Saviour Church, Richmond Hill, Leeds, a church founded to preach and illustrate Tractarian principles. On 28 October 1847 Forbes was consecrated to succeed Bishop Moir in the see of Brechin. He removed the episcopal residence to Dundee, where he resided till his death, combining the pastoral charge of the congregation with the duties of the see. When he came to Dundee the churchmen were accustomed owing to their small numbers to worship in a room over a bank. Through his energy several churches were built, and among them the pro-cathedral of St Paul's. He was prosecuted in the church courts for heresy, the accusation being founded on his primary charge, delivered and published in 1857, in which he set forth his views on the Eucharist. He made a powerful defence, and was acquitted with a censure and an admonition. Keble wrote in his defence, and was present at his trial at Edinburgh. Forbes was a good scholar, a scientific theologian and a devoted worker, and was much beloved. He died at Dundee on 8 October 1875. Forbes' younger brother George Hay Forbes was also a member of the Episcopalian clergy, patristics scholar and editor. Bishop Forbes' correspondence is held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee as part of the Brechin Diocesan Library Manuscripts Collection. This collection includes correspondence with William Gladstone. St Drostan's Episcopal Church in Tarfside, Glen Esk was built in 1879 in memory of Bishop Forbes. ==Principal works== *A Short Explanation of the Nicene Creed (1852) *An Explanation of the Thirty-nine Articles (2 vols, 1867 and 1868) *Commentary on the Seven Penitential Psalms (1847) *Commentary on the Canticles (1853) ==References== ;Secondary sources * Mackey, Bishop Forbes, a Memoir ==External links== *Bibliographic directory from Project Canterbury *The Scottish Communion Office Done into Greek (1865) *Catalogue of Correspondence of Alexander Penrose Forbes, Bishop of Brechin and George Frederick Boyle held at the University of Dundee Category:1817 births Category:1875 deaths Category:Anglican saints Category:Scottish Episcopal theologians Category:Bishops of Brechin (Episcopalian) Category:People from Edinburgh Category:People educated at Edinburgh Academy Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:Anglo-Catholic bishops Category:19th- century Anglican bishops Category:19th-century Christian saints Category:Scottish Anglo-Catholics Category:Anglo-Catholic theologians ","title":"Alexander Forbes (bishop of Brechin)"},{"id":"1294886","text":"Marty Montez Booker (born July 31, 1976) is a former American football wide receiver who played for eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for Louisiana-Monroe, he was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 1999 NFL Draft. During his first tenure with the Bears, he earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2002. He also played for the Miami Dolphins from 2004 to 2007, Bears in 2008, and Atlanta Falcons in 2009. ==Early years== Marty Montez Booker was born July 31, 1976 to Vera and Calvin Booker of Jonesboro, La. Booker attended Jonesboro-Hodge High School in Jonesboro, Louisiana. He was a two-sport standout in both football and track. In football, he was a quarterback and passed for and 48 combined touchdowns as a senior, at a college meet, he was told that he was super athletic, and quarterback wasn't the right spot for him, he chose WR. Following his senior season, he finished as the runner-up for the national Gatorade High School Player of the Year award. In track, he was ranked second in the state high jump finals as a senior. Booker also was a standout basketball player. ==College career== Marty Booker attended the University of Louisiana-Monroe where he was a three-year starter. He finished his college career with 178 receptions for 2,784 yards (15.6 avg.) and 23 touchdowns. He was an All-Independent first-team selection as a senior with 75 catches for and 11 touchdowns, averaging per game. He ranks second in school history for career receptions. ==Professional career== ===First stint with Bears=== Booker was drafted in the third round (78th overall) in the 1999 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. He started four of the nine games in which he played during his rookie season, catching 19 passes for 219yd and three touchdowns. He did not play in each of the first six games of the season, with his first regular season action coming on an October 24 contest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Booker's first career reception occurred on November 14 against the Minnesota Vikings, when he grabbed seven passes for 134yd and two touchdowns in what was also the first start of his career. He became the first Bears rookie to register a receiving game since Willie Gault in 1983. Booker also combined with Marcus Robinson to become the 15th tandem in Bears history to record receiving games in the same contest. In 2000, Booker started seven of the 15 games in which he played, finishing third on the team with 47 receptions for and a pair of scores . He was inactive for a September 17 game against the New York Giants with a shoulder injury. He had five catches for against the Detroit Lions on September 24 - a game which began his streak of 82 straight games with a reception. In 2001, Booker started all 16 games and set a Bears single-season reception record with 100, breaking the old mark of 93 set by Johnny Morris in 1964. That total also ranked second in the NFC and sixth in the NFL. On the season, he totaled 1,071 receiving yards, good for ninth in the NFC. He became just the seventh receiver (8th time) in Bears history to post a receiving season. He collected a season-high nine receptions on five occasions, including each of the first two games. In a 31-3 win at the Atlanta Falcons on October 7, he had a TD catch from Jim Miller and a TD pass to Marcus Robinson. He hauled in seven passes for and a career-high three touchdowns in 27-24 win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 18, including a career-long TD catch (from Miller) in the game. Booker earned the first Pro Bowl berth of his career in 2002 as he accumulated 97 receptions for and six touchdowns. He became the first Bears wide receiver to earn Pro Bowl status since Dick Gordon in 1972. Booker's reception total was second in team history, trailing only his 100 catches from 2001, while his yardage total was the fourth-best single-season figure. His reception total also was third in the NFC and tied for sixth in the NFL in 2002 while yardage figure was seventh in the NFC and ninth in the NFL. He became just the second Bear to account for multiple receiving seasons in a career, joining Harlon Hill (1954, 1956) Booker tied for fourth in the NFL with 20 receptions of or longer, while placing seventh in the NFC with 54 first-down catches and sixth in the conference with 24 third-down receptions. He amassed a career-high three receiving games on the season, including the opener against the Minnesota Vikings on September 8 when he produced - tied for the third highest single- game total in Bears history. His second game of the season occurred against the Green Bay Packers on October 7, when he hauled in a career-high 12 passes - the fourth-highest single-game total in team history. Booker also threw a touchdown pass to Marcus Robinson against the New England Patriots on November 10. Booker all 13 games in which he played in 2003 and was the Bears‚Äô leading receiver for the third straight year, catching 52 passes for and four touchdowns. He was inactive for three games in October and November with an ankle injury. He compiled the seventh receiving game of his career as he totaled on five receptions, including a TD catch, at Green Bay on December 7, when he tied Neal Anderson for fifth on Chicago‚Äôs all-time receiving list with 302. Booker caught six passes for in finale at the Kansas City Chiefs on December 28, as he set a Bears record for consecutive games with a reception (58). Booker concluded his Chicago career with 315 receptions for and 23 touchdowns. He ranks fifth on the team‚Äôs all-time chart for receptions and sixth for receiving yards. His reception total was the most by any Bear in his first five years with the club while his yardage figure was third during this same time span. On August 23, 2004, the Bears traded Booker and their third- round draft pick in 2005 to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for defensive end Adewale Ogunleye, who was coming off a career-high 15 sacks with the Dolphins in 2003. The following April, the Dolphins used the third-round draft choice acquired from the Bears on Florida linebacker Channing Crowder, who has since developed into a productive starter for the team. ===Miami Dolphins=== Booker started 15 games during his first season with the Dolphins in 2004. He finished third on the team with 50 receptions for 638 yards and a touchdown, behind fellow wide receiver Chris Chambers and tight end Randy McMichael. He had a reception in every game that he played for the fourth year in a row. Booker turned in his most productive receiving day of the season at the New England Patriots on October 10, when he hauled in seven passes for 123 yards. His entire receiving total from the game came in the second half as he became the first Dolphin to account for 100 yards receiving in a half since December 15, 2002 when Chris Chambers had 117 yards in the first half against the Oakland Raiders. Booker tossed a 48-yard completion to Chambers against the St. Louis Rams on October 24 for the third and longest completion of his career. That led to a Sammy Morris eight-yard touchdown run on the next play from scrimmage for the Dolphins‚Äô first score of a game they went on to win, 31-14, as they earned their initial victory of the season. He was inactive for finale at the Baltimore Ravens on January 2, 2005 with an ankle injury. In 2005, Booker started 12 of the 15 games in which he played, and was inactive for one contest. The three games he did not start occurred when Dolphins opened with two tight ends. He caught 39 passes for 686 yards and three touchdowns on the season. His reception total ranked third on the team, behind Chris Chambers and Randy McMichael while his yardage figure was second (behind only Chambers). Booker's average per catch of 17.6 was the best on the team among players with more than five receptions, and also marked a personal best. It also was the best figure by a Dolphin since 2002 when James McKnight put together an 18.2 mark. Booker accounted for a pair of 100-yard receiving games on the year, including the season opener against the Denver Broncos when he hauled in five passes for 104 yards. Included in that total was a 60-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Gus Frerotte - the second-longest pass play by the Dolphins in 2005. It was also Booker's fourth career catch of 60 yards or longer and his longest since he had a 61-yard touchdown catch on December 7, 2003 at Green Bay as a member of the Chicago Bears. He had five catches for 102 yards against the New England Patriots on November 13, marking the first time since 2002 that he had two or more 100-yard receiving games in the same season. He was held without a catch at Cleveland on November 20, snapping his streak of 82 straight games with a reception. Prior to that, the last time he did not have a catch was on September 10, 2000 at Tampa Bay as a member of the Chicago Bears. Booker had two receptions for 56 yards on December 18 against the New York Jets, including a 50-yard touchdown catch from Sage Rosenfels 4:05 into the fourth quarter, which broke a 17-17 tie as the Dolphins held on for a 24-20 victory. Booker hauled in a 15-yard touchdown pass from Gus Frerotte in fourth quarter of a January 1 contest against the New England Patriots, giving the Dolphins a 25-13 lead in their 28-26 victory. In 2006, Booker finished first on the team in reception yardage and in touchdown receptions with 55 catches for 747 yards and six touchdowns. He had two other receptions for two-point conversions and also has three rushes for 19 yards. His receiving totals were his highest in all three categories since his 2002 season as a member of the Chicago Bears. In addition, his six touchdown receptions is tied for the second highest single season total of his career (along with his six TD catches in 2002 as a member of the Bears), surpassed only by his eight touchdown catches in 2001 with the Bears. Booker because a favorite target of quarterback Joey Harrington later in the season, with four touchdown catches in three games from Weeks 11 to 13. Booker started 14 games during the season and was inactive twice - on December 25 against the New York Jets due to an ankle injury and on October 15 at the New York Jets due to a chest injury. A projected starter in 2007, it was reported on April 26 that Booker was on the trade bloc. However, Booker remained with the Dolphins as their No. 2 receiver behind Chris Chambers, with the team trying to work rookie first round pick Ted Ginn Jr and Derek Hagan more into the offense. Following a disastrous start to the season for the Dolphins, Chris Chambers was traded on October 16 to the Chargers for their second round draft pick in 2008. Booker then became the only experienced receiver for rookie QB John Beck and career back-up Cleo Lemon to throw to for the rest of the season. During the following offseason on February 11, 2008, Booker was one of nine players released by the Dolphins. ===Chicago Bears (second stint)=== On March 4, 2008, Booker agreed to a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears worth $3.5 million. He caught only 14 passes for 211 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 51-yard touchdown reception. Booker was released by the Bears on February 13, 2009. ===Atlanta Falcons=== Booker signed with the Atlanta Falcons on August 6, 2009, after the team waived undrafted rookie wide receiver Bradon Godfrey. Booker became an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2009 season. ==References== ==External links== *Chicago Bears bio Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Jonesboro-Hodge High School alumni Category:Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks football players Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:People from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Category:People from Jonesboro, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana ","title":"Marty Booker"},{"id":"1294887","text":" The fourth USS Columbia (C-12/CA-16) was a protected cruiser in the United States Navy during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. She was the lead ship of her class of two cruisers; her sister ship was . The class was originally designed with three funnels; however, Columbia was built with four and Minneapolis with two. This may have been to make them resemble specific passenger liners. Columbia was launched 26 July 1892 by William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company, Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss H. Morton; and commissioned 23 April 1894, Captain George Watson Sumner in command. ==Service history== USS Columbia at night, 1898 USS Columbia in Guantanamo Bay. Image of the USS Columbia published in THE BLISS MAGAZINE Columbia joined the North Atlantic Squadron, and from 30 July 1894 to 5 January 1895 cruised to protect American interests in the Caribbean. She participated in the intervention in Nicaragua from July to August 1894. She visited Europe in the summer of 1895 and represented the United States at the ceremonial opening of the Kiel Canal in June. Returning to the east coast in August, she operated in the western Atlantic until going in ordinary, in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard 13 May 1897. On 28 April, 1896 passenger steamer () struck the anchored ship at Newport News, Virginia and sank. Wyanoke had 107 passengers and 42 crew onboard, of with two passengers and 1 crewman drowned, and one crewman died of injuries in the hospital. Recommissioned 15 March 1898 for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Columbia patrolled along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies until 26 August. She convoyed troops to Puerto Rico and aided in its occupation between July and 14 August. Columbia was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard 31 March 1899. Following recommissioning on 31 August 1902, Columbia served as receiving ship at New York and from 9 November 1903 as a part of the Atlantic Training Squadron. Once more out of commission at Philadelphia between 3 May 1907 and 22 June 1915, the cruiser then joined the Submarine Flotilla as flagship. After cruising between the various Atlantic submarine bases on inspection tours, she was detached 19 April 1917. Columbia patrolled off the Delaware Breakwater from 21 April 1917 as flagship of Squadron 5, Patrol Force until July when she joined the Cruiser Force as a convoy escort. Between 1 January and 13 November 1918 she made five Atlantic escort voyages, protecting the passage of men and supplies for the American Expeditionary Force in France. On her detachment 7 January 1919, she became flagship of Squadron 2, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, operating along the East Coast and in the Caribbean. She was relieved as flagship on 29 May but continued cruising until decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard 29 June 1921. Reclassified CA-16, 17 July 1920, she was renamed Old Columbia 17 November 1921, and sold 26 January 1922. ==Awards== * Sampson Medal * Navy Expeditionary Medal * Spanish Campaign Medal * Cuban Pacification Medal * World War I Victory Medal with \\"Atlantic Fleet\\" clasp ==References== * ==External links== * * Naval Historical Center: USS Columbia Category:Protected cruisers of the United States Navy Category:Columbia-class cruisers Category:Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War cruisers of the United States Category:World War I cruisers of the United States Category:Ships built by William Cramp & Sons Category:1892 ships Category:United States Navy South Carolina-related ships ","title":"USS Columbia (C-12)"},{"id":"1294888","text":"The term choice theory is the work of William Glasser, MD, author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in psychology and counselling. ==Characteristics== Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour (choices) are driven by five genetically driven needs: survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power. Survival needs include: * food * clothing * shelter * breathing * personal safety * security and sex, having children and four fundamental psychological needs: * Belonging/connecting/love * Power/significance/competence * Freedom/autonomy * Fun/learning Choice theory suggests the existence of a \\"Quality World\\". Glasser's idea of a \\"Quality World\\" restates the Jungian idea of archetypes but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's \\"Quality World\\" and what Jung would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable. Our \\"Quality World\\" images are our role models of an individual's \\"perfect\\" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's \\"Quality World\\" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted. Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and icons, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our \\"Quality World\\". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory. Glasser also posits a \\"Comparing Place\\" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating‚Äîas best we can‚Äîour real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes). Behavior (\\"Total Behavior\\" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components: acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology. A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed relationships with people important to us: spouses, parents, children, friends and colleagues. The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as mental illness. Glasser believed that \\"pleasure\\" and \\"happiness\\" are related but are far from synonymous. Sex, for example, is a \\"pleasure\\" but may well be divorced from a \\"satisfactory relationship\\" which is a precondition for lasting \\"happiness\\" in life. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory‚Äîthe \\"new reality therapy\\". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation. Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. Reality therapy is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices. == The ten axioms of choice == # The only person whose behavior we can control is our own. # All we can give another person is information. # All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems. # The problem relationship is always part of our present life. # What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future. # We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World. # All we do is behave. # All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology # All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think. # All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable. == In classroom management == William Glasser's choice theory begins: behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to \\"help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it\\".Charles, C.M. (2008). Building Classroom Discipline. (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education. For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life. ==Education== Glasser was no supporter of Summerhill. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning. == Critiques == In a book review,Review of Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health, Jackson, W. Clay. 2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2 W. Clay Jackson writes, \\"Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the DSM-IV-TR is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings.\\" ==See also== * Cognitive psychology * Introspection illusion * L√©opold Szondi ==References== * Bourbon, W.

Assembled in 1941, the purpose of the group was to reinforce the British colonial garrisons in the Far East and deter Japanese expansion into British possessions, particularly Malaya and Singapore. Lack of aircraft to protect Force Z, underestimation of the Japanese armed forces and the political rather than naval motive for its deployment, are blamed for the destruction of the force. ==Background== ===Strategy for Far East reinforcement=== Inter-war British planning for a war against the Empire of Japan sought to defend British interests in China (the \\"offensive\\" strategy), and to defend imperial lines of communications, particularly through the Indian Ocean (the \\"defensive strategy\\"). Singapore was chosen as the main Royal Navy (RN) base. It put the fleet within steaming range of China. The base was also on the \\"Malay Barrier\\", the eastern forward defence zone for the Indian Ocean,Boyd: page 60 although strictly speaking Singapore was not required to pursue a defensive strategy.Boyd: page 72 In the 1920s the RN could reinforce the Far East fleet from Britain and the Mediterranean SeaBoyd: page 75 to sufficiently to pursue the offensive strategy.Boyd: page 56 By the late 1930s, war with Germany and a stronger Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had to be considered; in the event of a European war the fewer naval forces would be available for the Far East fleet; reinforcement would arrive incrementally and the total end strength would suffice only for the defensive strategy.Boyd: page 70 In strategic discussions during 1940, Britain requested naval assistance from the United States in the Atlantic (against Germany) and the Malay Barrier (specifically to Singapore, against Japan) in the event that the United States entered the war. The required US naval forces would come from the Pacific Fleet. The Pacific Fleet was not large enough to fulfill both missions. The Americans had misgivings about deploying the Pacific Fleet to Singapore and chose the Atlantic. The Allies agreed that the Atlantic theatre was paramountBoyd: page 212 and the choice was affirmed at the ABC-1 talks the next year.Boyd: pages 186-188 Still, the British wanted a naval force at Singapore, which they believed was the only place where the vital Indian Ocean trade routes and the eastern British Dominions could be adequately covered.Boyd: page 216 To accomplish this, American naval forces arriving in the Atlantic would replace British naval forces, freeing British naval forces to redeploy eastwards. In February 1941, the RN planned the creation and movement of the Eastern Fleet to the Indian Ocean and Singapore based on this substitution.Boyd: page 215 The reinforcement of the Far East by the Eastern Fleet would occur in two phases. The first phase moved, at the earliest possible time, a minimum force into the Indian Ocean able to counter Japanese cruisers engaged in commerce raiding; the first phase would occur early in the Atlantic substitution. The second phase moved the bulk of the Eastern Fleet - if able to, to Singapore or - if Singapore had already fallen - the eastern Indian Ocean after American naval mobilization in the Atlantic was complete. The transfer of the Eastern Fleet was projected to be completed 80 days after the entry of the United States into the war. The basic structure of the plan remained unchanged from February 1941 to early December 1941, although the details were subject to regular revisions.Boyd: page 209-210 By August 1941, phase 1 was planned as Force H, joined as soon as possible by the phase 2 battleships, the s and s. The limiting factor to forming the full Eastern Fleet was a shortage of cruisers and destroyers.Boyd: page 280-281 The first British capital ships to arrive in the Indian Ocean were the battleship in mid-September, and the battlecruiser in early October.Boyd: page 284 ===Return to offensive plans=== The United States did not wait to enter the war to become active in the Atlantic. By August 1941, there was sufficient American participation in the Atlantic to make a peacetime execution of the British Far East naval reinforcement plan feasible.Boyd: page 275 In September, it was proposed that phase 1 could be made more powerful, and the core of the Eastern Fleet could be in place by January 1942. The shortage of destroyers would prevent the deployment of capital ships beyond the Malay Barrier, but retaining capital ships in the Indian Ocean would free cruisers to operate beyond the Malay Barrier. With such a powerful force, the RN returned to offensive plans against Japan in September. At ABC-1, the United States rejected reinforcing the United States Asiatic FleetBoyd: page 186 with an US aircraft carrier task force.Boyd: page 191 The new RN plan resurrected the concept. Singapore would be the Eastern Fleet's main repair base. Manila, in the Philippines, would be its forward operating base come wartime.Boyd: page 285 It would over-optimistically rely on Royal Air Force (RAF) cover in Malaya, and the major American air reinforcement of the Philippines announced at the Atlantic Conference;Boyd: page 285Boyd: page 287 the latter factor may not even have been considered by the RN strategists.Boyd: page 289 ===British assessment of Japanese intentions=== In July, the Japanese moved into southern Indochina. In response, the British reassessed Japanese intentions from August to early September, which came to a number of conclusions. The Japanese were waiting for the outcome of the German invasion of the Soviet Union before deciding on a northern or southern expansion strategy, but were concentrating resources in anticipation of the former. Malaya was vulnerable due to the Japanese encroachment in Indochina, but was not immediately threatened due to the northern option and the monsoon season, which would prevent amphibious landings on Malaya until February 1942. The assessment was fatally flawed. It underestimated economic factors driving Japanese toward the southern strategy.Boyd: page 290-291 It also failed to appreciate that the Gulf of Thailand was reasonably sheltered against the monsoon.Boyd: page 292 As a result, air reinforcement to Malaya was deferred; aircraft went to the Middle East, and to the Soviet Union as aid. Overall, Japan seemed at such a disadvantage that increased military deterrence might still prevent war or delay its onset. ===Selecting Prince of Wales=== In late August, Prime Minister Winston Churchill discussed Far East reinforcement with Admiral Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord. Churchill proposed augmenting phase 1 with a . The United States declared its intent to deploy modern battleships to the Atlantic at the Atlantic Conference in early August; this would make a King George V-class ship available.Boyd: page 279-280 Pound favoured keeping the King George Vs in Britain.Boyd: page 281 Pound proposed basing the Nelsons, the battlecruiser , and an aircraft carrier at Singapore. This would be for deterrent value in peacetime, to be withdrawn to Ceylon on the onset of war; the British believed a wartime fleet at Singapore had to be competitive with a major portion of the IJN.Boyd: page 281-282 Interestingly, Pound did not envision an aircraft carrier in the Far East until spring 1942.Boyd: page 282-283 In meetings on 17 and 20 October, the British Defence Committee formally discussed Far East naval reinforcement in response to the fall of the moderate Konoe government on 16 October. In agreement with August-September assessment of Japanese intentions, Churchill and his cabinet favoured the deployment of a modern battleship for deterrent effect.Boyd: page 294-295 The RN, as part of its offensive strategy, planned to send the Nelson and Revenge- class battleships to Singapore, but the Nelsons could not deploy. was damaged in the Mediterranean Sea in late-September. Crew leave prevented from deploying until mid-December, and a gun refit scheduled from February to May 1942 was required before she could conduct further operations. With working up, the earliest either could reach the Far East was August 1942. The King George V-class was, aside from the Revenges, the only worked-up battleship that could sail east before Spring 1942.Boyd: page 295 On 20 October, the Committee decided to send Prince of Wales to Cape Town, South Africa.Boyd: page 297 Once at Cape Town, a review would decide whether to send the ship onward to Singapore;Mahoney and Middlebrook: chapter 3 this would keep Prince of Wales available to respond to an emergency in home waters.Boyd: page 311 Churchill requested an aircraft carrier for Force Z on 17 October, but nothing came of this;Boyd: page 301 the earliest available carrier would be in November after working up.Boyd: page 290-291 Contrary to post-war accounts, Indomitable was not allocated to Force Z. Neither Admiralty plans during the period, nor the secret session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 19 December concerning the loss of Force Z, nor the 7 December tabulation of current and intended fleet strength in the Far East, allocate the carrier to the Eastern Fleet. The carrier did not receive any orders to this effect prior to grounding in Kingston, Jamaica, on 2 November, at the start of a three-week work-up. Joining Force Z by 8 December would have required no grounding and abandoning the work-up.Boyd: page 302 ==Prince of Wales sails to Singapore== Prince of Wales and the escorting destroyers , , and , were formed into Force G in Britain; they sailed from Greenock on 25 October 1941. The group was commanded by Admiral Sir Tom Phillips,Mahoney and Middlebrook: chapter 4 who had played a major role in shaping naval strategy in the Far East.Boyd: chapter 7 Hesperus was temporarily assigned from Western Approaches Command. Three days later also temporarily joined the escort while Electra and Express detached to refuel at Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Hesperus and Legion left Force G the following day with the return of the other destroyers. Force G refuelled at Freetown on 5 NovemberMahoney and Middlebrook: chapter 5 and arrived at Cape Town early on the 16 November.Boyd: page 312 On 2 November, Churchill was notified that Pound intended to conduct the review agreed upon on 20 October before Force C arrived at Cape Town. Pound never conducted the review. The Admiralty, in accordance with its offensive plans, was committed to the move to Singapore before Prince of Wales sailed. On 21 October, the Admiralty informed relevant naval commands that the battleship was on route to Singapore. Once Force G sailed, the Admiralty sought to expedite the transit. On 6 November, Phillips expected to stay in Cape Town for seven days, and arrive at Singapore on 13 December. On 11 November, the Admiralty formally ordered Prince of Wales to combine with Repulse at Ceylon before proceeding to Singapore. The orders also suggested - with reservations from Churchill - that the battleship might abandon its escort in the interest of speed; consequently, Force G remained in Cape Town for only two days. Up to 5 October, Churchill still believed the decision to move Prince of Wales beyond Cape Town was still under review, and accepted Pound's advice and decisions; it was indicative of Churchill not understanding the Admiralty's new offensive predilection the previous October. British plans to provide media coverage of the arrival of Force G at Cape Town for propaganda and deterrence were disrupted by the shortened duration of the visit. Interviews of ships crew and visits by photographers were cancelled. Japanese diplomats reported the visit on 19 November; thereafter the Japanese expected Prince of Wales to arrive at Singapore at the end of November.Boyd: page 314 Force G departed Cape Town on the afternoon of 18 November. It refuelled at Mauritius and Port T, Addu Atoll on the journey eastwards. It arrived at Ceylon on 29 November and was joined by Repulse, and the destroyers and ; the destroyers were transfers from the Mediterranean Fleet. Phillips disembarked and flew ahead to Singapore to meet with local commanders; on 4 December he also flew to the Philippines to meet with American commanders.Boyd: page 314 Force G finally arrived at Singapore on 2 DecemberBoyd: page 317 and was redesignated to Force Z on 8 December at the outbreak of war.Boyd: page 294 ==Final deployment and loss== Phillips ordered Force Z to sortie on 8 December against Japanese amphibious landings on Malaya in the Gulf of Thailand. Encounter and Jupiter were out of action with defects and were replaced by the First World War destroyers and .Mahoney and Middlebrook: chapter 6 Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941, becoming the first capital ships moving at sea to be sunk solely by enemy aircraft. British air forces in Malaya were insufficient to provide air cover to Force Z. Poor pre-war forecasts of Japanese intentions caused the deferment of air reinforcement,Boyd: page 290-291 and by the time war was likely it was impossible to provide sufficient reinforcement in time.Boyd: page 171 Phillips also failed to make full use of intelligence resources. As a result, he grossly underestimated the scale of attack, and believed that the majority of enemy attack aircraft would be level bombers rather than land-based naval torpedo bombers.Boyd: page 320-323 ==See also== * Force B * Force H * Force K ==References== ===Notes=== ===Books=== * * Category:Royal Navy task forces Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"Force Z"},{"id":"1294897","text":"Sammy D.

He is married to Freda Knight, a Hampton University Graduate. They have four daughters named Shianne, Samone, Savannah, and Sasha. Knight also has an older daughter named Aneka. ==Professional career== ===New Orleans Saints=== ====1997==== On April 25, 1997, the New Orleans Saints signed Knight to a one- year, $138,500 contract as an undrafted free agent after he went undrafted in the 1997 NFL Draft. Throughout training camp, Knight competed to be the starting strong safety against Je'Rod Cherry, Vashone Adams, and rookie Rob Kelly. Head coach Mike Ditka named Knight the backup strong safety to begin the regular season, behind starting strong safety Vashone Adams. He made his professional regular season debut in the New Orleans Saints' 38‚Äì24 season- opening loss at the St. Louis Rams. On September 28, 1997, Knight earned his first career start and recorded 11 combined tackles and made his first career interception during a 14‚Äì9 loss at the New York Giants in Week 5. Knight made his first career interception off a pass by Giants' quarterback Dave Brown, that was originally intended for wide receiver Kevin Alexander, and returned it for a 32-yard gain in the third quarter. On September 30, 1997, the New Orleans Saints released Vashone Adams after Knight surpassed him on the depth chart and became the starting strong safety. In Week 14, Knight recorded eight combined tackles and made two interceptions in the Saints' 16‚Äì13 win at the Carolina Panthers. Knight made two interceptions off pass attempts by Kerry Collins and Steve Beuerlein during the game. Knight finished his rookie season in 1997 with 84 combined tackles and five interceptions in 16 games and 12 starts. ====1998==== On February 18, 1998, the New Orleans Saints offered Knight a one-year restricted free agent contract tender to remain with the team. Knight became the starting free safety after Anthony Newman departed in free agency. Head coach Mike Ditka named Knight the starter to begin the season, alongside strong safety Chad Cota. Knight was inactive for two games (Weeks 4‚Äì5) due to an injury. On November 8, 1998, Knight made three tackles, two interceptions, and scored his first career touchdown during a 31‚Äì24 loss at the Minnesota Vikings in Week 10. Knight intercepted a pass by Vikings' quarterback Brad Johnson and returned in for a 91-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. In Week 16, he collected a season-high ten combined tackles and returned an interception for a touchdown in the Saints 19‚Äì17 loss at the Arizona Cardinals. Knight intercepted a pass by Cardinals' quarterback Jake Plummer, that was intended for wide receiver Frank Sanders, and returned it for a 32-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Knight finished the 1998 NFL season with 75 combined tackles and a career-high six interceptions in 14 games and 14 starts. His six interceptions tied for eighth most in the league in 1998. ====1999==== On March 23, 1999, the New Orleans Saints signed Knight to a five-year, $10 million contract with a signing bonus of $2 million.

In the process, racers often drive dangerously close to traffic, barriers, and spectators watching from the roadsides without any protection. Tafheet driver practice and events are generally seen on the wide sectioned highways of Riyadh, Al- Qassim Province and, less notably, in other parts of Saudi Arabia. The technique does not involve recognised high-speed rally racing skills such as high-speed cornering using power slides. The skill involves sliding around on a wide flat straight road section at high speed, drifting sideways, and recovering with opposite lock, repeatedly. Tafheet practice and events occur with little or no concern for vehicle occupants, other drivers, or spectator safety. Many videos and compilations of the minor and horrific accidents that result are posted online. ==Culture== Some of the more popular tafheet maneuvers include: * Axeyat: turning the car 180 degrees from side to another completing a full 360 by starting from the right to the left or opposite, kind of street sweeping * Harakat Almawt (Death movement or stir): a power slide where one must keep the car going on forward in a straight line until the car stops by itself without fixing the steer or going off track * Sefty: spinning the car a full 360 degrees starting from any side and then spinning the opposite side of the first 360 with a short power slide between * Ta'geed: spinning the car a full 360 degrees while driving either straight or sideways more than once * Tanteel: repeatedly creating a power slide and steering it back with opposite lock at high speed , starting with 4 or more power slides and usually concluded with Ta'geed, Sefty, or Axeyat. It is also considered the main maneuver. * Tatweef: passing another vehicle, truck, or more going sideways at very high speed up to on a public highway no matter how busy the traffic is Lack of hobbies amongst youth in the country, and lack of interest in the arts by mainstream society, has been cited as the motivation for youths to participate in drifting exhibitions. The cars are generally stock rental cars and are basic mid-size front wheel drive vehicles, such as the Toyota Camry, minimizing personal cost and repair liability. While there have been instances involving high-end vehicles such as Ferraris and Nissan GT-Rs, these are relatively less common compared to joyriders stealing sedans or compact cars for the purpose of drifting, abandoning them after an event. ==Response== Often the police receive reports about high-speed drifting from concerned citizens demanding an arrest because of the risk to public safety. The drifters are rarely caught as the events are organised using an illegal spotter or spotters who use mobile phones to disband the vehicle activity before the police arrive on the scene. Although the police response is rapid, investigations often prove fruitless; generally, the spectators and drivers have left or are dispersing into regular traffic when the police arrive. Videos of tafheet events are often uploaded to the Internet to be seen by the spectators and drivers. Occasionally, police attempt to intercept the drivers but are chased away by both the drivers and spectators. In March 2014, a 23-year-old Saudi nicknamed \\"The King of Nazeem Neighborhood\\" was sentenced to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for a series of car drifting and firearms offenses in Riyadh and Al-Qassim Province. The drifter was also banned from driving for life. To combat this, academies and leagues have since been established by professional racers in the region, in an effort to mitigate illegal street drifting incidents and to educate youths against the dangers of such activities, encouraging them instead to participate in officially sanctioned events. ==See also== * Street racing ** Boy racer ** Hoon ** Mat Rempit == Bibliography == * Abdullah Aldawsari, Investigating 'tafheet' as a Unique Driving Style Behaviour, 2016, Montfort University *Suhasini Ramisetty- Mikler, Abdulkarim Almakadma, Attitudes and behaviors towards risky driving among adolescents in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 2016 *Salameh Ahmad Sawalah, Talal M.

He served in the Worcestershire Regiment in the Second World War, reaching the rank of sergeant, but was captured in 1940 and spent five years as a prisoner of war in Germany. During this time he obtained a BSc in economics from University of London as an external student and became a chartered secretary.Worcestershire Regiment (29th/36th of Foot) Web site At the end of the war, he received an adult scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, and after a brief spell on an economics fellowship at the University of Cambridge (1948‚Äì50) he trained as a barrister, being called to the Bar in 1954. ==Parliamentary career== Mulley had been a member of the Labour Party since 1936 and at the 1945 general election he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Sutton Coldfield. He became Member of Parliament for Sheffield Park in 1950, a position he held until deselected by his local party prior to the 1983 general election.

Ivo Bligh until 1900, lord of the Manor of Cobham, Kent, was a British noble, parliamentarian and cricketer. Bligh captained the England team in the first ever Test cricket series against Australia with The Ashes at stake in 1882/83. Later in life, he inherited the earldom of Darnley and sat at Westminster as an elected Irish representative peer. ==Background and education== Bligh was born in London, the second son of John Bligh, 6th Earl of Darnley, by Lady Harriet Mary, daughter of Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1882. At Cambridge, he was secretary of the University Pitt Club. and played for Cambridge against Oxford in the Real Tennis Varsity Match of 1880https://www.tennisandrackets.com/downloads/TennisResults/OxfordandCambridgeDoubles.pdf ==Cricket career== Although the history of Test cricket between England and Australia dates from 1877, it was after an English team led by Monkey Hornby lost to the Australians at The Oval in 1882, that The Sporting Times newspaper wrote a mock obituary to English cricket, noting that the body would be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia. The following winter's tour to Australia was billed as an attempt to reclaim The Ashes. Bligh's team was successful, winning the three-match Ashes series two-one, although a fourth game, not played for The Ashes, and hence a matter of great dispute, was lost. A small terracotta urn was presented to The Hon. Ivo Bligh, as England captain, by a group of Melbourne women after England's victory in the Test series. The urn is reputed to contain the ashes of a bail, symbolising \\"the ashes of English cricket\\". While the urn has come to symbolise The Ashes series, the term \\"The Ashes\\" predates the existence of the urn. The urn is not used as the trophy for the Ashes series, and, whichever side \\"holds\\" the Ashes, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at Lord's. Since the 1998/99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners. Bligh is commemorated by a poem inscribed on the side of the urn: :When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn; :Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return; :The welkin will ring loud, :The great crowd will feel proud, :Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn; :And the rest coming home with the urn. Bligh also played for Cambridge University and Kent in a first-class cricket career which lasted from 1877 to 1883. He was elected President of the Marylebone Cricket Club for 1900/01 and of Kent County Cricket Club in 1892 and 1902. ==Public offices== Bligh succeeded his elder brother Edward as Earl of Darnley in 1900. As the holder of an Irish peerage he was not automatically entitled to a seat in the House of Lords (his brother's English peerage, the barony of Clifton, had passed to Edward's daughter Elizabeth), but was elected as soon as was practicable, in March 1905, to sit in Parliament as an Irish Representative Peer. The year after his succession to the family titles, Lord Darnley was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Kent. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 4th Volunteer Battalion, The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) on 16 July 1902. ==Personal life== He married Florence Rose Morphy, daughter of John Stephen Morphy, of Beechworth, Victoria, Australia on 9 February 1884. She had been a music teacher at Rupertswood, where her future husband had stayed during his tour of Australia. They had two sons and a daughter: *Esm√© Bligh, 9th Earl of Darnley (1886‚Äì1955) *Hon.

Moody's preaching, after C. T. Studd invited him to attend Moody's campaign meeting. Lord Darnley died at Shorne, Kent in April 1927, aged 68, being succeeded in the family titles by his eldest son, Esm√©.

He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1873, Officer in 1878, and Commander in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Cabanel in the Institut de France. Henner's most widely known work is his 1885 painting of Saint Fabiola. Although the original is now lost, it was copied by artists around the world for devotional purposes. Artist Francis Al√øs has collected over 500 copies of the painting in a variety of media. The collection is known as the \\"Fabiola Project\\". Henner died at age 76 in Paris. ==Pupils== Henner had numerous pupils; among them were the American painter Mathilde Mueden Leisenring and the Romanian artist Dimitrie Serafim. From 1874 to 1889, organized with Carolus-Duran, what he called \\"the studio of the ladies\\" for women were not allowed entry to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Some also served as his models.

A Federalist, Duer wrote in support of ratifying the United States Constitution as \\"Philo-Publius.\\" He had earlier served in the Continental Congress and the convention that framed the New York Constitution. In 1778, he signed the United States Articles of Confederation. ==Early life== Duer was born in county of Devon, Great Britain, in 1743. He was the son of John Duer, a planter in Antigua in the West Indies, who kept a villa in Devon, and Frances Frye. She was the daughter of Sir Frederick Frye, who held a command in the West Indies, where she met and married Duer. Duer was educated at Eton, and while still under age, was put into the army as ensign. He accompanied Robert Clive as aide-de-camp on his return to India as governor general in 1762. He suffered severely from the climate, so Lord Clive sent him back to England, where he remained five years until his father's death, upon which he inherited his father's estates in Dominica. ==Career== Having left the army, Duer went to Antigua. He traveled to New York State, for the first time in 1768, to arrange for a regular and constant supply of lumber for his plantations in Antigua and Dominica. As a planter, he traded extensively with Philip Schuyler, who persuaded him to move to New York early in the 1770s. On a previous trip to the area, Duer had purchased tracts of land on the upper Hudson River near Albany. The area, known as Fort Miller, served both as Duer's first residence and as the site of his early financial ventures. Duer set up sawmills, warehouses, and a store. In 1773 he returned to England, where he obtained a contract to supply the Royal Navy with timber for masts and spars. By 1776, had built a moderately successful mercantile business based primarily on lumber production. ===American Revolution=== Duer was originally a moderate Whig, somewhat reluctant to become involved in active resistance to the British government. But he became a member of the Provincial Congress in 1775; he was one of the committee which drafted the original New York Constitution the next year. Duer was a member of the 1st New York State Legislature, serving in the New York State Senate for the Eastern District from September 9, 1777 to June 30, 1778. He served as a member of the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779. While in Congress, he reportedly impressed future president John Adams and financier Robert Morris from Philadelphia, with whom he served on the finance committees as well as the \\"Board of War,\\" the precursor to the War Department. In 1779, Duer returned to private business, in partnership with John Holker, the French commercial agent. He also did well in his business of supplying the American army, under contracts arranged for him by Robert Morris. ===Later life=== Duer became a prominent speculator after the peace; he was also elected to the New York General Assembly in 1786. When Alexander Hamilton, Schuyler's son-in-law, became first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789, Duer became the first Assistant Secretary. He continued to speculate in American bonds, including the failed Scioto Company scheme to buy up the American debt to France at a discount. Duer went bankrupt as a result of the Panic of 1792, and was held in debtor's prison for the rest of his life.Cowan, David J. (2009, Spring). \\"William Duer and America's First Financial Scandal\\", Financial History, 97, 20‚Äì35. His failure has been cited as a cause of the panic, reportedly the first in New York caused by speculation. The loss was estimated at $3,000,000, and impoverished many in all classes. ==Personal life== Catherine Duer In 1779, Duer married Lady Catherine Alexander (1755‚Äì1826), second daughter of Sarah (n√©e Livingston) Alexander and General William Alexander, the claimant of the Scottish earldom of Stirling, and a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The marriage took place at Alexander's country seat, \\"The Buildings,\\" near Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was designed in the style of a residence of an English nobleman, with all the appointments of an English country seat. Catherine's paternal grandparents were New Jersey Attorney General James Alexander and merchant Mary Spratt Provoost Alexander, and her maternal grandparents were Catherine Van Brugh Livingston and Philip Livingston, 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor. She was, descended from the De Peysters, Livingstons, and Schuylers, and occupied a prominent place in the society of the period. Together, they were the parents of eight children, including: * William Alexander Duer (1780‚Äì1858), who was a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and for many years the President of Columbia University. He married Hannah Maria Denning (1782‚Äì1862), daughter of U.S. Representative William Denning. * John Duer (1782‚Äì1858), who was a noted lawyer and jurist of New York.

Westcott, in 1815. Duer died in New York City on April 18, 1799 at the age of 57. He was buried in the family vault under the old church of St. Thomas, and later reinterred in Jamaica, Long Island, New York. After his death, his widow remarried to William Neilson on September 15, 1801. ===Descendants=== Through his eldest son William, he was the grandfather of Denning Duer, great-grandfather of James Gore King Duer, and the great-great-grandfather of Alice Duer Miller (1874‚Äì1942), the feminist poet and writer.Burstyn, Joan N.

He was a president of Columbia University, then called Columbia College. His family wealth derived from the transatlantic slave trade.Columbia University and Slavery ==Early life== He was the son of William, a member of the Continental Congress and Catherine Alexander Duer. His brother John Duer was a New York lawyer and jurist. His nephew William Duer, the son of John Duer, also served in Congress. William A. Duer studied law in Philadelphia, and with Nathaniel Pendleton in New York. ==Career== During the quasi-war with France in 1798 he obtained the appointment of midshipman in the navy, and served under Stephen Decatur. After the conflict with France ended, he resumed his studies with Pendleton, and was admitted to the bar in 1802. He engaged in business with Edward Livingston, who was then district attorney and mayor of New York. After Livingston moved to New Orleans, Duer formed a professional partnership with his brother-in-law, Beverley Robinson. In addition to practicing law, he contributed to a partisan weekly paper called the Corrector, conducted by Peter Irving in support of Aaron Burr. Duer later moved to New Orleans to again form a law partnership with Livingston, and also made a study of Spanish civil law, which had governed New Orleans in its early years. Duer found the climate in New Orleans disagreeable to his health, and this factor coupled with his marriage with the daughter of William Denning, a prominent New York politician and businessman, convinced him to return to New York City. In New York, he contributed literary articles to the Morning Chronicle, the newspaper of his friend Peter Irving. He next opened an office in Rhinebeck, and in 1814 was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he was appointed chairman of a committee on colleges and academies, and succeeded in passing a bill, which is the original of the existing law on the subject of the common-school income. He was also chairman of the committee that arranged the constitutionality of the state law vesting the right of navigation in Livingston and Robert Fulton, and throughout his service bore a prominent part in promoting canal legislation. From 1822 until 1829, he was a judge of the New York Supreme Court. In 1829, he was elected president of Columbia College (now Columbia University), where he remained until failing health compelled him to resign in 1842. During his administration he delivered to the senior class a course of lectures on the constitutional jurisprudence of the United States (published in 1833; revised ed., 1856). He delivered a eulogy on President James Monroe from the portico of the city hall. After his retirement he resided in Morristown, New Jersey. ===Works=== After retiring, he wrote the life of his grandfather, Lord Stirling (published by the Historical Society of New Jersey). In 1847 he delivered an address in the college chapel before the literary societies of Columbia, and in 1848 an historical address before the St. Nicholas Society, which gives early reminiscences of New York, and describes the scenes connected with the inauguration of President Washington, both of which were published. He was the author of two pamphlets addressed to Cadwallader D. Colden on the \\"Steamboat Controversy,\\" and the \\"Life of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling\\" (New York, 1847). ==Family== He was married to Hannah Maria Denning (1782‚Äì1862), daughter of William Denning, a prominent whig of New York.

Dicks had the distinction in the 1979 general election of being the only Conservative candidate in the whole South of England outside London to be defeated by a Labour candidate with a five figure majority, he was beaten with a majority of 11,183. He obtained the nickname Phil for, according to The Telegraph, \\"elevating Philistinism to an art form\\". ==Early life and career== Dicks was born in Bristol on 17 March 1937 with cerebral palsy. His early jobs included work at Imperial Tobacco as a clerk until 1959. He was educated at the University of Oxford (DipEcon) and the London School of Economics (BSc (Econ)).‚ÄòDICKS, Terence Patrick, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014. ==Political career== ===Outside Parliament=== Dicks was elected to Hillingdon Borough Council in 1974. In 1978 he attracted controversy after treating a white Rhodesian family differently to an Asian family, despite the fact that both had arrived in the UK as immigrants. He was suspended in 1982 when the Greater London Council took issue with comments he made regarding arrears from the Strongbridge Housing Association. Dicks was selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for the seat of Bristol South in the 1979 general election, but he lost out to Labour's Michael Cocks. From 1999 until he retired in June 2009, Dicks was a member of Surrey County Council, representing the town of Addlestone. Beginning in 2011, he was a Runnymede district councillor for Chertsey South and Row Town. ===Member of Parliament=== Dicks was elected as the Member of Parliament for Hayes and Harlington in 1983 in succession to Neville Sandelson. He was known for his hardline right-wing views and caused controversy over several public statements he made. His strong opposition to state funding for the arts inspired Labour MP Tony Banks to claim, in a February 1990 debate, that Dicks' presence in the House of Commons was \\"living proof that a pig's bladder on a stick can get elected to Parliament.\\"Iain Dale \\"The Right Hon wag\\", The Guardian, 10 January 2006. In another arts funding debate in July that year, his remarks were controversial enough for fellow Conservative MP Patrick Cormack, in a heated House of Commons, to say, \\"This man is a disgrace to the House of Commons.\\" Dicks replied, \\"My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South (Cormack) reminds me of Henry VIII not with all the doublet and hose, but at least well fed.\\" Regarding Derrick Gregory, a mentally subnormal man who had been sentenced to death in Malaysia for drug smuggling, Dicks said he would be writing to the Malaysian government congratulating it on its approach. On Farzad Bazoft, an Observer journalist hanged by Saddam Hussein in 1990, Dicks said he \\"deserved to be hanged\\" on the eve of his execution.Leader, The Observer, 18 March 1990. In 1990, when Nelson Mandela declined to meet the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a trip to London, a greatly offended Dicks asked, rhetorically, \\"How much longer will the Prime Minister allow herself to be kicked in the face by this black terrorist?\\" Dicks, unfaltering in this belief, further insisted that the African National Congress \\"were just terrorists\\", adding \\"a terrorist is a terrorist. I don't accept this view of freedom fighters one day ‚Äì terrorists one day, freedom fighters the next. No. No. And if they had wanted to they could have executed him. Seriously.

An opening batsman, Shrewsbury played his cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and played 23 Test matches for England, captaining them in 7 games, with a record of won 5, lost 2. He was the last professional to be England captain until Len Hutton was chosen in 1952. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1890.

The football tour in fact added to the losses, ending in an ¬£800 deficit to add to the ¬£2400 lost on the cricket leg of the tour. ==1888 Australian rules football and Rugby tour of Australasia== Shrewsbury organised and played on a little known and unique tour in which a British team played a series of matches in Australian rules football, in Victoria and South Australia and Rugby matches in Australia's northern states and New Zealand.Football's Forgotten Tour, the story of the British Australian rules venture of 1888 This tour is noteworthy as it was the only tour in the history of Australian rules football, apart from New Zealand's early participation in the sport's interstate competition, where an international team toured Australia. It was also of note because on the tour a number of people involved on the British side commented that they liked the Australian game more than Rugby. Shrewsbury also participated in organising a return tour by an Australian team to Britain, in which the Australian rules side of the tour was cancelled at the last moment. At the time in England and Scotland there was interest in Australian rules football and games were played, and it has been suggested that had the Australian rule side of tour gone ahead then Australian rules football could possibly have spread around the world like a number of other sports from the British Empire. ==Best batsman in England== Shrewsbury scored a century against Sussex in his first match back in England, but this was his highest score of the 1889 season.

During the spring his health started to improve, but it was unlikely that he would play county cricket in 1903. On 12 May 1903 Shrewsbury bought a revolver from a local gunsmith. He returned a week later after having difficulty in loading the gun. The clerk found that Shrewsbury had the wrong bullets and supplied the correct ones. Shrewsbury went to his bedroom that evening and shot himself first in the chest and then, when that did not prove fatal, in the head. His girlfriend, Gertrude Scott, found him bleeding from a head wound and by the time a doctor arrived Shrewsbury was dead. At the inquest, held the following day, the coroner decided that Shrewsbury had committed suicide, his mind having been unhinged by the belief that he had an incurable disease. The coroner added that there was, however, no evidence to show Shrewsbury was suffering from a major illness.

B. Fry described his play thus: \\"The idea that he is slow is mistaken. True, he is often half an hour without scoring; but somehow he makes up for it and is all but even with his more mobile partner. The fact is he waits for the ball he wants, and then secures a certain fourer. He does not waste time and energy in banging ball after ball into fieldsman's hands.\\" Edward Sewell, a contemporary of Shrewsbury's, described his play like this: \\"And so, little by little, this little man playing a quite different kind of cricket to any other Big Noises of his time, perfected his own chosen method; never heeding anything in the shape of advice or an adviser, until he became a king of legend.\\" The method of play Sewell was referring to is back-play, which allowed Shrewsbury to master the bad wickets which were often found on county grounds. Most batsmen of 1870s and 1880s typically played off the front foot. His Wisden obituary contains similar sentiments: \\"As a batsman he had a style of back play peculiarly his own, and his judgment of the length of bowling was almost unequalled. It was said of him that he seemed to see the ball closed up to the bat than any other player.\\" Shrewsbury was not a strong or muscular man and stated that he did not hit the ball, but steered it in the desired direction. Shrewsbury's technique was criticised by Rait Kerr in his book 'The laws of cricket'. He wrote: \\"As we have seen the improvement in pitches enabled Arthur Shrewsbury to develop a new gospel of defensive batsmanship which soon made many converts. From about 1885 this technique involved an increasing use of the pads.\\" At the time the lbw law stated that for the batsman to be out, the ball had to pitch between wicket and wicket. In 1888 the MCC considered a change to the law but instead issued a statement saying that defending the wicket with the body was against the spirit of the game. ==Shaw and Shrewsbury== During the 1879 tour of North America Shrewsbury along with Alfred Shaw finalised plans to start a business. 'The Midland Cricket, Lawn Tennis, Football and General Athletic Sports Depot' in Carrington Street, Nottingham. Following the profitable tour of 1881/2 they opened a factory under the name 'Gresham Works' situated in Waterway Street and in the spring of 1884 the name of the firm was changed from 'The Midland Cricket, Lawn Tennis, Football and General Athletic Sports Depot' to 'Shaw and Shrewsbury'. Their trademark of a kangaroo and emu with a cricket bat between them was introduced in 1886. Following the financial losses made during the tour of Australia in 1887/8 the firm downsized from the two buildings into a single building in Queen's Bridge Road. After Shrewsbury's death his share in the firm was split between his brother, William, and four of his nephews. The firm was closed in 1939 with its assets being bought by Grays of Cambridge. ==See also== * History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883 * History of Test cricket from 1884 to 1889 * History of Test cricket from 1890 to 1900 ==References== ==Cited sources== * ==External links== * Cricinfo Profile * CricketArchive stats * Lenton Listener Article Category:1856 births Category:1903 deaths Category:England Test cricket captains Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:United North of England Eleven cricketers Category:Midland Counties cricketers Category:Cricketers who committed suicide Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:People from Lenton, Nottingham Category:Suicides by firearm in England Category:English rugby union administrators Category:Players of the North cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:C.

In the late 16th century the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was experiencing a short period of internal stability. This, however, was threatened by the Cossacks, who organised raids into Crimea, Moldavia, and other lands of the Ottoman Empire. To counter the threat, Sultan Murad III threatened Poland‚ÄìLithuania with war if the Cossack pillaging was to continue. In 1580 the Sejm in Warsaw passed the Order in Ukraine (PorzƒÖdek ze strony Ni≈ºowc√≥w i Ukrainy) Act, in which the Registered Cossacks were banned from raids to the Zaporizhian Sich, taking captives and pillaging. Any Cossack who broke this law was to be put to death without trial. In 1591 Kosi≈Ñski, who was at that time one of the colonels of the Registered Cossacks in Kiev Voivodship, was deprived of his estate in the villages of Rokitno and Olszanice by the Ostrogski family. To take his lands back, Kosi≈Ñski gathered his regiment and captured the castle of Bila Tserkva. There he named himself a Hetman of Cossacks and started a revolt against Polish rule in Ukraine and the rule of local Ruthenian nobility and magnates in the lands of Kiev and Bratslav. What started as a private act of revenge soon turned into a full-scale civil war between local Ruthenian nobility and the Cossacks. By 1592 a large part of the society of Ukraine supported the revolt and it spread to Volhynia. However, the conflict was seen by Polish hetman and chancellor Jan Zamoyski as yet another struggle for power in Ukraine and the Polish forces of hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski did not enter the war. The local nobles started a levee en masse and with their own private forces began a pursuit of Kosi≈Ñski's forces. The two armies clashed near the village of PiƒÖtek on 2 February 1593. After a short fight, the forces of the Cossacks were defeated by Duke Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski. In what became known as the Battle of PiƒÖtek, Kosi≈Ñski himself was taken prisoner. He promised to obey the orders of the Hetmans of the Crown and the rebellion ended. However, the following year he broke his promise and escaped to Zaporizhia, where he started to organise yet another Cossack army. Moreover, on 13 May 1593 he signed a document in which he subjected Ukraine to Muscovite tsar Feodor I. Soon afterwards he gathered approximately 2000 men and began a fast march towards the seat of the starost of Cherkasy. Local nobility organised a strong defence composed mainly of their private forces. Little is known of the fate of the campaign. According to Aleksander Wi≈õniowiecki, Kosi≈Ñski was killed in a battle against his forces, while the chronicle of Marcin Bielski mentions that Kosi≈Ñski was found drunk in a guest house and killed in a duel. In the spring of 1593 the Sejm passed a revised Of Ni≈ºowcy (O Ni≈ºowcach) Act, in which it declared all the remaining forces of Kosi≈Ñski guilty of high treason and sentenced them to death. The remaining Cossack forces signed an agreement in August of the same year in which the Registered Cossacks could return home with their arms and boats as well as amnesty in exchange for their loyalty. ==See also== * Nalyvaiko Uprising * Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:Cossack uprisings Category:Wars involving Poland Category:Warfare of the Early Modern era Category:1590s conflicts Category:16th-century rebellions Category:16th century in Ukraine Category:Rebellions in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:Military history of Ukraine ","title":"Kosi≈Ñski uprising"},{"id":"1295142","text":"Aubrey Geoffrey Frederick Rippon, Baron Rippon of Hexham, PC, QC (28 May 1924 ‚Äì 28 January 1997) was a British Conservative politician. He is most known for drafting the European Communities Act 1972 which took the United Kingdom into the European Communities on 1 January 1973. He was Chairman of the European- Atlantic Group. ==Early life== Born in Penn, Buckinghamshire, the son of the Somerset cricketer Sydney Rippon, Geoffrey Rippon was educated at King's College, Taunton, and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was president of the University Conservative Association. He was called to the Bar in 1948 and was Mayor of Surbiton 1951‚Äì52 and a member of the London County Council from 1952, representing Chelsea. From 1958, he was the leader of the Conservative Party group on the council. ==Parliamentary career== After unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Shoreditch and Finsbury in both 1950 and 1951, he became MP for Norwich South in 1955. As Minister for Public Building and Works in 1962, Rippon controversially sought to demolish and redevelop the Italianate Foreign and Commonwealth Office main building designed in the 1860s by Sir George Gilbert Scott. After a campaign led by the Victorian Society and a public outcry the decision was overturned and the building was subsequently granted Grade I listed building status. In 1964 Rippon was defeated, but moved to the constituency of Hexham in Northumberland at the 1966 general election and remained MP there until retiring in 1987. Among his posts in the Shadow Cabinet was that of Shadow Defence Secretary from 1969 to 1970. In 1970 he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under Edward Heath, and being in favour of the Common Market was given the responsibility of negotiating Britain's entry into it. In 1972 he moved to become Secretary of State for the Environment. During his tenure the Department of the Environment was housed on Marsham Street in unattractive tower blocks nicknamed 'the three ugly sisters'. Rippon is supposed to have commented to his civil servants that the view from the top floor was the best in London, as one could not see the towers themselves. While Secretary of State for the Environment he introduced the Water Act 1973, which amalgamated over 1500 separate private, and local authority water provision, sewage, water treatment, and regulatory entities into 10 Regional Water Authorities, organised on a natural Hydrological basis. He was at one time a prominent member of the Conservative Monday Club, for whom he authored a booklet entitled Right Angle, and was guest-of-honour at their Annual Dinner in 1970. The Club was, however, divided on the EEC (European Community) issue, and at their conference in October 1971 members moved and carried a resolution opposing Britain's entry. From 1979 to 1982, Rippon was President of the European Documentation and Information Centre (CEDI). He was created a life peer on 5 October 1987 taking the title Baron Rippon of Hexham, of Hesleyside in the County of Northumberland. ==Arms== ==References== * Copping, Robert, The Story of The Monday Club ‚Äì The First Decade, (Foreword by George Pole), Current Affairs Information Service, Ilford, Essex, April 1972, (P/B). == External links == * - - - - - Category:1924 births Category:1997 deaths Category:20th-century English lawyers Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:British Secretaries of State for the Environment Category:Chancellors of the Duchy of Lancaster Category:Conservative Party (UK) MEPs Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Rippon of Hexham Category:Councillors in Greater London Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:English barristers Category:MEPs for the United Kingdom 1973‚Äì1979 Category:Mayors of places in Greater London Category:Members of London County Council Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home governments, 1957‚Äì1964 Category:People educated at King's College, Taunton Category:People from Chiltern District Category:Presidents of the Oxford University Conservative Association Category:UK MPs 1955‚Äì1959 Category:UK MPs 1959‚Äì1964 Category:UK MPs 1966‚Äì1970 Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:UK MPs 1979‚Äì1983 Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 ","title":"Geoffrey Rippon"},{"id":"1295153","text":"Boxgrove is a village, ecclesiastical parish and civil parish in the Chichester District of the English county of West Sussex, about north east of the city of Chichester. The village is just south of the A285 road which follows the line of the Roman road Stane Street. The Anglican parish has an area of . According to the 2001 census it had a population of 901 people living in 423 households of whom 397 were economically active. The 2011 Census indicated at population of 957. Included in the parish are the hamlets of Crockerhill, Strettington and Halnaker. ==Governance== An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches northwest to West Dean with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,235. ==History== ===Archaeology=== Boxgrove is best known for the Lower Palaeolithic archaeological site discovered in a gravel quarry known as Amey's Eartham Pit located near the village but in Eartham Parish. Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of University College London. Numerous Acheulean flint tools and remains of animals (some butchered) dating to around 500,000 years ago were found at the site.Fox, Alex, Europe‚Äôs Oldest Bone Tools Hint at Early Hominin Sophistication, Smithsonian, August 14, 2020 The area therefore was used by some of the earliest occupants of the British Isles. Remains of Homo heidelbergensis were found on the site in 1994, the only postcranial hominid bone to have been found in Northern Europe. Teeth from another individual were found two years later. ===Hundred of Boxgrove=== The ancient hundred of Boxgrove was listed in the Domesday Book (1086) as comprising nine settlements with 246 households. The settlements were Aldingbourne, Halnaker, Strettington, Runcton, East Hampnett, Merston, Westhampnett and Upwaltham, and Boxgrove village itself had 13 households. ===Boxgrove Priory=== A Benedictine monastery was founded at Boxgrove by Robert de Haia (or de la Haye) early in the 12th century. The priory church remains as the Church of England parish church of St Mary and St Blaise, minus the original nave, and mostly dates from the 13th century. ===Early cricket=== Several parishioners of Boxgrove were prosecuted for playing cricket in the churchyard in 1622. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was the charge that \\"a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt\\".McCann T (2004) Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century, p.xxxi.

It is about twice the size of a regular (soprano) oboe and sounds an octave lower; it has a deep, full tone somewhat akin to that of its higher- pitched cousin, the English horn. The bass oboe is notated in the treble clef, sounding one octave lower than written. Its lowest note is B2 (in scientific pitch notation), one octave and a semitone below middle C, although an extension may be inserted between the lower joint and bell of the instrument in order to produce a low B2. The instrument's bocal or crook first curves away from and then toward the player (unlike the bocal/crook of the English horn and oboe d'amore), looking rather like a flattened metal question mark; another crook design resembles the shape of a bass clarinet neckpiece.Example: See 1:04 at The bass oboe uses its own double reed, similar to but larger than that of the English horn. ==Etymology== The instrument is known popularly as the \\"bass oboe\\" in the English language and \\"hautbois baryton\\" (baritone oboe) in French. The bass designation is in resonance with that of the bass flute in the flute family and the bass clarinet in that family: an instrument pitched an octave below the principal instrument of its genre. ==History== Early bass oboes were modeled after bassoons, with a boot joint and bocal (such as the Triebert's'instruments, which still had a bulb bell) and some holes drilled obliquely; later an enlarged English horn design was adopted. The concept of the bass oboe as an enlarged English horn survived, and the hautbois baryton, redesigned by Fran√ßois Lor√©e, was introduced in 1889. Some confusion exists between the bass oboe and the Heckelphone, a double reed instrument of similar register introduced by the firm of Wilhelm Heckel in 1904, and which is distinguished from standard members of the oboe family by its wider bore, different fingering system (on older instruments), and larger bell. As a result, it is not always clear in English orchestral works of the early 20th century which of the two instruments is intended when the composer requests \\"bass oboe\\". The instrument has been manufactured sporadically by various companies, including F. Lor√©e, Marigaux, Rigoutat, Fossati, and others. It is usually a \\"special order\\" instrument, and its purchase price normally exceeds that of a top-of-the-line English horn. ==Repertoire== *In the Great Museum of our Memory, for Bass Oboe by Brian Cherney *The East Coast Concerto for Bass Oboe and Orchestra by Gavin Bryars *Earth Spirit for bass oboe and orchestra by Yuang Chen One of the most notable uses of the bass oboe is in Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\", where the instrument is used to great effect and provides a tone of which no other instrument is capable. Notable solo lines include some faint parts during \\"Mars\\", during the bitonal runs in the woodwind in \\"Mercury\\", numerous exposed lines in the quieter moments of \\"Saturn\\" (probably the best example of a solo in the whole work), and in the 5th and 6th bars of the bassoon's soli after the opening notes of \\"Uranus\\". The bass oboe is also prominently featured in the First Interlude of Sir Michael Tippett's Triple Concerto. There is also a very substantial solo in the second movement of Thomas Ades' \\"Asyla\\". Frederick Delius scored for the bass oboe in six of his works: Songs of Sunset, A Mass of Life, Requiem, An Arabesque, Fennimore and Gerda and Dance Rhapsody No. 1, however, the latest research reveals that despite his use of this term, Delius' intended instrument was the Heckelphone. Arnold Bax calls for it in his Symphony No. 1, and Havergal Brian requires an instrument in both the Gothic Symphony and his Symphony No. 4 Das Siegeslied. Humphrey Searle calls for the instrument in his Third Symphony (1960). Percy Grainger includes the bass oboe in Children's March and The Warriors. The bass oboe has not as yet come into its own as a solo instrument; only a single solo bass oboe concerto has been written to date (The East Coast, by English composer Gavin Bryars, composed in 1994). The work was written for the Canadian performer Lawrence Cherney, who uses a bass oboe manufactured by F. Lor√©e. Two concerti have been written featuring the bass oboe in addition to the other four members of the oboe family, these works being David Stock's \\"Oborama\\" and James Stephenson's \\"Rituals and Dances\\", both written for Alex Klein. Robert Moran's Survivor from Darmstadt, for nine amplified bass oboes, was commissioned by oboist Nora Post and premiered in 1984. At least one sonata for bass oboe and piano, by Simon Zaleski, has been written. A very recent discovery (2015) is a unique bass (or baritone) oboe in E, in the possession of Peter Hurd. This instrument, playable with a single-reed mouthpiece and clarinet reed, was very likely made for a pit or jazz band alto saxophonist to be able to switch to an ostensible double-reed instrument while continuing to use the same part and without significant embouchure alteration. ==References== ==External links== *Baritone oboe page from Rigoutat site *Bass oboe page from F.

During approximately the first 15 years of this period, many comic book characters were redesigned, creators gained prominence in the industry, independent comics flourished, and larger publishing houses became more commercialized. An alternative name for this period is the Dark Age of Comic Books, due to the popularity and artistic influence of titles with serious content, such as Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen.Voger, Mark (2006), p. 6. ==Developments== Because the time period encompassing the Modern Age is not well defined, and in some cases disputed by both fans and most professionals, a comprehensive history is open to debate. Many influences from the Bronze Age of Comic Books would overlap with the infancy of the Modern Age. The work of creators such as John Byrne (Alpha Flight, Fantastic Four), Chris Claremont (Iron Fist, Uncanny X-Men), and Frank Miller (Daredevil) would reach fruition in the Bronze Age but their impact was still felt in the Modern Age. The Uncanny X-Men is the most definitive example of this impact as Bronze Age characters such as Wolverine and Sabretooth would have a huge influence on the Marvel Universe in the 1980s and beyond. For DC, Crisis on Infinite Earths is the bridge that joins the two ages. The result was the cancellation of The Flash (with issue 350), Superman (with issue 423), and Wonder Woman (with issue 329). The post-Crisis world would have Wally West as the new Flash, John Byrne writing a brand-new Superman series, and George P√©rez working on a new Wonder Woman series. Batman would also get a makeover as the Batman: Year One storyline would be one of the most popular Batman stories ever published. In rough chronological order by the beginning of the trend, here are some important developments that occurred during the Modern Age, many of which are interrelated: ===Rise of independent publishers=== The late 1970s saw famed creators going to work for new independent publishers. The arrival of Jim Shooter as Editor in Chief at Marvel Comics saw the departure of key creators at Marvel such as Steve Gerber, Marv Wolfman, and others. In these new companies (Pacific, Eclipse, First) creators were free to create very personal stories. Mike Grell's Jon Sable Freelance, Howard Chaykin's American Flagg!, Mike Baron and Steve Rude's Nexus, Dave Steven's Rocketeer and John Ostrander's GrimJack attracted some attention and garnered a number of awards. These creators were brought in by DC editor Mike Gold to create defining works such as Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters by Grell, Blackhawk by Chaykin, and Hawkworld by Truman. With Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Art Spiegelman's Maus (which would later receive the Pulitzer Prize), this period marks the summit of the artform per comics expert Scott McCloud. ===Fantasy and horror=== The Comics Code Authority was established in 1954, and specified that no comic should contain the words \\"horror\\" or \\"terror\\" in its title. This led EC Comics to abandon its horror comics line. Publishers such as Dell and Gold Key comics did run an expanding line of silver-age horror and \\"mystery\\" titles during the early 1960s, and Charlton maintained a continuous publishing history of them, during the later 1960s, a gradual loosening of enforcement standards eventually led to the re- establishment of horror titles within the DC and Marvel lineups by the end of the decade. Since this genre's evolution does not neatly match the hero- dominated transitional phases that are usually used to demarcate different eras of comic books, it is necessary to understand this \\"silver age\\" and \\"bronze age\\" background. 1970s horror anthology series merely continued what had already been established during the late 1960s, and endured into the 1980s until they were markedly transformed into new formats, many of which were greatly influenced by, or directly reprinted, \\"pre-code\\" content and styles of the early 1950s. Starting with Alan Moore‚Äôs groundbreaking work on DC's Swamp Thing in the early 1980s, horror comic books incorporated elements of science fiction/fantasy and strove to a new artistic standard. Other examples include Neil Gaiman‚Äôs The Sandman (followed a few years later by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon‚Äôs Preacher). DC's Vertigo line, under the editorship of Karen Berger, was launched in 1993, with the goal of specializing in this genre. Existing titles such as Animal Man, Doom Patrol, Hellblazer, and Shade, the Changing Man were absorbed into this new line. Other titles later were created for the line, which continued successfully into the 2010s. Starting in the 1990s and throughout the 2000s, a number of successful movie adaptations of comic books, partly due to improvements in special effect technology, helped to extend their market audience, attracting the attention of many new readers who previously had not been interested in comic books. This also led to an avalanche of other comic book adaptations which included previously lesser known Vertigo titles, notably Constantine (based on the comic book Hellblazer) and V for Vendetta. ===Rise of antiheroes=== In the mid-1970s, Marvel antiheroes such as the X-Men's Wolverine, the Punisher, and writer/artist Frank Miller‚Äôs darker version of Daredevil challenged the previous model of the superhero as a cheerful humanitarian. Miller also created Elektra, who straddled the conventional boundary between love interest and villain. Two artistically influential DC Comics limited series contributed to the trend: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, also by Frank Miller and Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, both of which were series of psychological depth that starred troubled heroes. By the late 1980s DC had published many mature titles such as John Constantine, Hellblazer, Swamp Thing, and Lobo. They featured morally ambiguous characters such as the cynical John Constantine and the violence-loving Lobo with graphic violence and adult content that differentiated them from other mainstream titles. DC later separated these titles to their launched Vertigo imprint that publishes titles outside of the DC Universe. By the early 1990s, antiheroes had become the rule rather than the exception, and among the most popular were Marvel Comics' Cable and Venom and Image Comics' Spawn. The trend of creating characters with more psychological depth that were less black-and-white, also affected supervillains. For example, the Joker, Batman's nemesis, was portrayed less as an evil criminal and more as a mentally ill psychopath who cannot control his actions, Marvel Comics' galactic planet-eater Galactus became a force of nature who means no personal malice in his feedings, and the X-Men's nemesis Magneto became more benign and sympathetic as a man who fights for an oppressed people, albeit through means that others deem unacceptable. ==Development of the X-Men franchise== By the mid-1980s, X-Men had become one of the most popular titles in comics. Marvel decided to build on this success by creating a number of spin-off titles, sometimes collectively referred to as \\"X-Books\\". These early X-Books included New Mutants (which would later become X-Force), X-Factor, Excalibur, and a Wolverine solo series. There were many new popular additions to the X-Men in the 1990s, including Cable and Bishop. By the early 1990s, X-Men had become the biggest franchise in comics, and by the middle of the decade over a dozen X-Men-related comic books, both continuing and limited series, were published each month. On an almost annual basis from 1986 until 1999, one storyline crossed-over into almost every X-Book for two to three months. These \\"X-Overs\\" usually led to a spike in sales. This sales boom resulted in a great deal of merchandising, such as action figures, video games and trading cards. This success was thanks in no small part to the Fox Network's animated X-Men series, which debuted in 1992 and drew in a large number of younger fans. The sales boom began to wane in the mid to late 1990s, due to the crash of the speculators' market and the effect it had on the industry. Marvel declared bankruptcy in 1996,Randy Duncan & Matthew J. Smith, The Power Of Comic History Form & Culture (London, England: The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc.) and as a result, scaled back all of their franchises, including X-Men. A number of \\"X-books\\" were canceled, and the amount of limited series published, as well as general merchandise, was reduced. In the early 2000s, a series of blockbuster X-Men movies have kept the X-Men franchise healthy, and have resulted in a larger market presence outside of comics. In 1999‚Äì2000, a new animated series, X-Men: Evolution debuted, while new toys have been developed and sold since the success of the first X-Men feature film. The comic books themselves have been reinvented in series such as Grant Morrison's New X-Men and the Ultimate X-Men, which, like Marvel's other \\"Ultimate\\" series, is an alternative universe story, starting the X-Men tale anew. This was done for X-Men, and other books, because Marvel feared that the long and complex histories of the established storylines of certain titles were scaring off new readers. ===Effect on other comics=== Many series tried to imitate the model the X-Men carved as a franchise. Marvel and DC expanded popular properties, such as Punisher, Spider-Man, Batman, and Superman into networks of spin-off books in the mid-to-late 1980s. Like the X-Books, some of these spin-offs highlighted a concept or supporting character(s) from a parent series, while others were simply additional monthly series featuring a popular character. In another similarity to the X-Books, these franchises regularly featured crossovers, in which one storyline overlapped into every title in the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù for a few months. With regards to storylines overlapping, the Superman stories from 1991‚Äì2000 were written on a weekly basis. One needed to buy Superman, Adventures of Superman, Action Comics, and Superman: The Man of Steel (and eventually, Superman: The Man of Tomorrow) to keep up with any existing storylines. If a collector only bought Action Comics, they would only get twenty-five percent of the story. A triangle was featured on the cover of every Superman title with a number on it. This number indicated which week of the year the Superman title was released. ==Makeovers and universe reboots== Complementing the creation of these franchises was the concept of redesigning the characters. The Modern Age of comics would usher in this era of change. The impact of Crisis on Infinite Earths was the first example as Supergirl died in issue 7, and long-time Flash (Barry Allen) died in issue 8. Specifically, Barry Allen signified the beginning of the Silver Age of Comics and his death was highly shocking at the time. Marvel Comics' Secret Wars would usher in a new change as well as Spider-Man would wear a black costume. This costume change led to the development of the character Venom. The interest in the speculator market of a new Spider-Man costume led to other changes for Marvel characters in the 1980s. Iron Man would have a silver and red armor in issue 200. Captain America would be fired and would be reborn as the Captain, wearing a black outfit in issue 337 of the series. The Incredible Hulk would revert to his original grey skin color in issue 325. Issue 300 of the first Avengers series resulted in a new lineup including Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, of the Fantastic Four. Within the decade, Wolverine would switch to a brown and yellow costume, Thor would be replaced by Thunderstrike, Archangel would emerge as the X-Men's Angel's dark counterpart after serving as one of Apocalypse's Horsemen, and many other Marvel characters would have complete image overhauls. The changes to Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine and most other Marvel characters would be undone in the early 1990s. The 1990s would bring similar changes to the DC Universe, including the death of SupermanSuperman vol 2 #75 and the crippling of Bruce WayneBatman #497 in 1993. The only lasting change was Kyle Rayner replacing Hal Jordan as Green Lantern. In addition to individual character or franchise/family wide makeovers, Crisis on Infinite Earths ushered in a popular trend of \\"rebooting\\", \\"remaking\\" or greatly reimagining the publisher-wide universes every 5‚Äì10 years on varying scales. This often resulted in origins being retold, histories being rewritten, and so forth. These reinventions could be on as large a scale as suddenly retconning seminal story points and rewriting character histories, or simply introducing and/or killing off/writing out various important and minor elements of a universe. Crisis on Infinite Earths resulted in several miniseries which explicitly retconned character histories, such as Batman: Year One, Superman: Man of Steel and Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals. An example of a less ambitious scale of changes is Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters, which did not explicitly retcon or retell Green Arrow's history, but simply changed his setting and other elements of the present, leaving the past largely intact. This trend of publisher wide reinventions, which often consists of a new miniseries and various spinoff storylines in established books, continued for decades, with DC's New 52 in 2011 and Marvel's Secret Wars in 2015. ==Image Comics and creator rights disputes== Spawn #1. Art by Todd McFarlane. In the mid-1980s, artist Jack Kirby, co-creator of many of Marvel's most popular characters, came into dispute with Marvel over the disappearance of original pages of artwork from some of his most famous titles. Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and many other contemporary stars became vocal advocates for Kirby. By the early 1990s, these events, as well as the influence of vocal proponents of independent publishing, helped to inspire a number of Marvel artists to form their own company, Image Comics, which would serve as a prominent example of creator-owned comics publishing. Marvel artists such as X-Men‚Äôs Jim Lee, The New Mutants/X-Force‚Äôs Rob Liefeld and Spider-Man‚Äôs Todd McFarlane were extremely popular and were idolized by younger readers in ways more common to professional athletes and rock musicians than comic book artists. Propelled by star power and upset that they did not own the popular characters they created for Marvel, several illustrators, including the above three formed Image Comics in 1992, an umbrella label under which several autonomous, creator- owned companies existed.\\"Bye Bye Marvel; Here Comes Image: Portacio, Claremont, Liefeld, Jim Lee Join McFarlane's New Imprint at Malibu,\\" The Comics Journal #148 (February 1992), pp. 11‚Äì12. Image properties, such as WildC.A.T.s, Gen¬π¬≥, Witchblade and especially McFarlane‚Äôs Spawn provided brisk competition for long-standing superheroes. Image in particular is singled out by some critics for contributing to the conditions which led to the speculator market crashing, as Image titles favored alternative covers, foil covers, and other \\"collectible\\" comics.\\"Newswatch: Industry Sales Records in 1993 Shadowed by Collapse of Speculator Boom: Image Receives Brunt of Criticism for Their Role in Market Crash,\\" The Comics Journal #166 (February 1994), pp. 27‚Äì33. Many popular creators followed Image's lead and attempted to use their star power to launch their own series; ones for which they would have licensing rights and editorial control. Chris Claremont, famous for his long run as the writer of Uncanny X-Men, created Sovereign Seven for DC; Joe Madureira, also made popular by Uncanny X-Men, launched Battle Chasers for WildStorm Productions; and Kurt Busiek, Alex Ross, and Brent Anderson created Astro City for Image. ==Milestone Comics and racial diversity== In 1993, a coalition of African-American writers and artists started Milestone Comics, believing that minority characters were underrepresented in American superhero comics. Some of the company's better-known series include Static, about an African-American teen who became Milestone's key character, Hardware, an example of Afrofuturism, Icon, about an alien mimicking the appearance of an African- American, and Blood Syndicate, a series about a multicultural gang of superheroes. All of these flagship titles were co-created by Dwayne McDuffie. In 1997, the Milestone Universe merged with the DC Universe. ==Rise and fall of the speculator market== By the late 1980s, important comic books, such as the first appearance of a classic character or first issue of a long-running series, were sold for thousands of dollars. Mainstream newspapers ran reports that comic books were good financial investments and soon collectors were buying massive amounts of comics they thought would be valuable in the future. Publishers responded by manufacturing collectors‚Äô items, such as trading cards, and ‚Äúlimited editions‚Äù of certain issues featuring a special or variant cover. The first issues of Marvel Comics' X-Force, X-Men vol. 2, and Spider- Man became some of the first and most notorious examples of this trend. Another trend which emerged was foil-stamped covers. The first Marvel comic book with a foil-stamped cover was the third volume of the Silver Surfer, issue 50 (June 1991). A glow-in-the-dark cover for Ghost Rider, volume 3, issue 15 appeared as well. This led a market boom, where retail shops and publishers made huge profits and many companies, large and small, expanded their lines. Image Comics in particular became notorious for this, with many of its series debuting with alternative covers, wide use of embossed and foil covers and other \\"collectible\\" traits. This trend was not confined to the books themselves, and many other pieces of merchandise, such as toys, particularly \\"chase\\" action figures (figures made in smaller runs than others in a particular line), trading cards, and other items, were also expected to appreciate in value. McFarlane Toys was notable for this, as it created many variations in its high-quality toys, most of which were main characters or occasional guest stars in the Spawn series. But few, in the glut of new series, possessed lasting artistic quality and the items that were predicted to be valuable did not become so, often because of huge print runs that made them commonplace. The speculator market began to collapse in summer 1993 after Turok #1 (sold without cover enhancements) badly underperformed and Superman's return in Adventures of Superman #500 sold less than his death in Superman #75, something speculators and retailers had not expected. Companies began expecting a contraction and Marvel UK's sales director, Lou Marks, stated in September 29 that retailers were saying there was \\"simply no room to display all the comics being produced\\".STARLOGGED reprinting Comic World #22, December 1993 The resulting crash devastated the industry: sales plummeted, hundreds of retail stores closed and many publishers downsized. Marvel made an ill-judged decision during the crash to buy Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor, which resulted in both distribution problems for Marvel and the industry's other major publishers making exclusive distribution deals with other companies, which would lead to Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. becoming the only distributor of note in North America. In 1996, Marvel Comics, the largest company in the industry and hugely profitable just three years before, declared bankruptcy (it has since rebounded). The crash also marked the relative downfall of the large franchises, inter-connected \\"families\\" of titles that lead to a glut of merchandising. While the big franchise titles still have a large amount of regular titles and merchandising attached to them, all of these things were notably scaled back after the crash. ==Rise of the trade paperback format== Although sales of comic books dropped in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, sales rose for trade paperbacks, collected editions in which several issues are bound together with a spine and often sold in bookstores as well as comic shops. In addition, the publishing format has gained such respectability as literature that it became an increasingly prominent part of both book stores and public library collections. Some series were saved from cancellation solely because of sales of trade paperbacks, and storylines for many of the most popular series of today (DC's JLA and various Batman series and Marvel's Ultimate Spider-Man and New X-Men) are put into trade paperback instantly after the storyline ends. Trade paperbacks are often even given volume numbers, making them a serializations of sorts. Due to this, many writers now consider their plots with the trade paperback edition in mind, scripting stories that last four to twelve issues, which could easily be read as a \\"graphic novel.\\" The popularity of trade paperbacks has resulted in older material being reprinted as well. The Essential Marvel line of trade paperbacks has reprinted heroes such as Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and has been able to introduce these Silver Age stories to a new generation of fans. These editions tend to resemble a phone book in that these are very thick books and are black-and-white (to help keep the cost down). DC Comics has followed suit by introducing a line called Showcase Presents. The first four have included Superman, Green Lantern, Jonah Hex, and Metamorpho the Elemental Man. Other characters have included Green Arrow, the Superman Family, the Teen Titans and the Elongated Man. ==Comics creators' mainstream success== While many comic book artists and writers had become well known by their readership as early as the 1940s, some comics creators in the late 1980s and the 1990s became known to the general population. These included Todd McFarlane, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore, and Frank Miller. Some, such as Gaiman, went on to write critically and commercially successful novels. Others, like Miller, became Hollywood screenwriters and directors. Conversely, film and TV directors and producers became involved with comics. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of TV's Babylon 5, was recruited to write Marvel Comics' The Amazing Spider-Man and, later Fantastic Four filmmaker Reginald Hudlin became the writer of Marvel's Black Panther. Joss Whedon, creator of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, wrote Marvel's Astonishing X-Men and Runaways, among other series. Richard Donner, who directed the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s, became a writer on the Superman feature in Action Comics in 2006, co-writing with comics writer (and Donner's former production assistant) Geoff Johns. Paul Dini, producer and writer of Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series, started writing for DC in 1994 on special projects and took the helm as writer of Detective Comics in 2006. Comics writer Peter David's career as a novelist developed concurrently with his comic-book career. Sandman writer Neil Gaiman has also enjoyed success as a fantasy writer and number one New York Times Bestseller. Michael Chabon who won the Pulitzer Prize with The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, a novel about the start of the Golden Age of Comic Books, then went on to write comics for DC and Dark Horse. Novelist Brad Meltzer saw success in the comics field with the controversial miniseries Identity Crisis, as well as runs on Green Arrow and Justice League of America. ==Influence of other countries, genres, media and markets== The mid to late 1980s would see the quiet introduction of various translated Japanese manga into North America. While not the first company to release translated manga, the first company to do so to a large degree was Eclipse which introduced Area 88, Legend of Kamui, and Mai the Psychic Girl, the three titles that are generally associated with the first wave of manga translated into English. Along with Comico and Eternity Comics's adaptation of the Robotech animated series, various other companies would release manga style comics such as Ben Dunn's Ninja High School and Barry Blair's Samurai. Dark Horse Comics would release many translated manga during the 1990s. Marvel's Epic Comics line would also license an English translation of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. As of the 2010s, most translated manga are distributed by subsidiaries of the original Japanese property owners, such as Kodansha, Shogakukan or Bandai. While manga translations were previously presented in the traditional American comic magazine format, the digest size publications traditional to manga has become common. In some cases, the books are presented in the original form intended to be read from right to left. Tokyopop was the first company to contract non- Japanese artists to produce and market (Original English-language manga). OELs are original material written by non-Japanese authors who directly emulate manga style in both storytelling and art and openly identify their works as manga. Previous manga-style comics consisted mostly of selective borrowing of manga or anime elements for a work that nevertheless is not intended to be regarded as manga. In October 2019 industry analyst Milton Griepp presented data at an ICv2 conference in New York showing that for the first time in decades, the market was dominated not by traditionally American monthly comics of the superhero genre, but graphic novels and trade paperbacks of other genres, particular those aimed at younger readers, such Dav Pilkey‚Äôs Dog Man and Raina Telgemeier‚Äôs Guts, and Japanese manga and manga-inspired books. These books see high sales in book stores, though the shift was also reflected in comics shops. According to data by Bookscan, child-oriented comics and graphic novels accounted for a 41% of sell-through at bookstores, and manga is 28%, while books of the superhero genre constituted less than 10%, a drop of 9.6% year-over-year. ==See also== * Events from the Modern Age of Comic Books * Portrayal of women in American comics ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1980s in the United States Category:1990s in the United States Category:2000s in the United States Category:2010s in the United States ","title":"Modern Age of Comic Books"},{"id":"1295187","text":" USS Roe (DD-24) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, and later in the United States Coast Guard designated CG-18.

With the new month, April, she was assigned to Squadron 2, Division 5, Patrol Force and ordered to assist Treasury and Labor Department officials at Wilmington, North Carolina, in preventing the destruction or escape of German merchant vessels. On the 6th, as the United States entered World War I, she sent an armed guard aboard Hohenfelde (see ). During her service in World War I, she was commanded by Captain William A.

It runs for 0.18 miles (0.29 km) approximately west-east between Marshall Street and Wardour Street, crossing Berwick Street. Broad Street was notorious as the centre of an 1854 outbreak of cholera. Dr John Snow traced the outbreak to a public water pump on the street, and disabled the pump. Before this time, the disease was widely thought to be caused by air-borne 'miasma'; Snow's findings showed it to be water-borne.

She was the first ship named for Edward A. Terry, and the first ship commanded by future Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King. Terry was laid down on 8 February 1909 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, launched on 21 August 1909, sponsored by Mrs. George Henry Rock, and commissioned on 18 October 1910, Lieutenant Commander Martin E. Trench in command. ==United States Navy== ===Pre-World War I=== Following trials off the east coast, Terry joined the Atlantic Fleet Torpedo Flotilla in winter operations in Cuban waters. She conducted both torpedo exercises with the flotilla and general maneuvers with the Fleet as a whole. In 1911 Terry made the first airplane rescue at sea, saving the life of James McCurdy 10 miles from Havana, Cuba. The routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean alternated with spring and summer operations along the New England coast continued until November 1913, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina for overhaul. Soon after entering Charleston Navy Yard, Terry was placed in reserve. Though still in reserve after her overhaul was completed, Terry continued to be active. During 1914, she patrolled the coast of Florida, and by February 1915, she was back in Cuban waters for winter maneuvers. That summer, Terry steamed as far north as Newport, Rhode Island to conduct another round of torpedo exercises. Upon completion of the mission, she returned to her base at Charleston. By 1 January 1916, the torpedo boat destroyer was operating with a reduced complement destroyer division. On the 31st, she cruised with units of the Atlantic Fleet to Key West, Florida. In May, she steamed to Santo Domingo. On 10 June, while maneuvering in the inner harbor at Puerto Plata, she struck a reef and settled until the greater part of the main deck was submerged. On the 13th, under the supervision of the commanding officer of , Terrys officers and men joined the staff of a wrecking company in salvage operations. The warship was refloated on 26 July, temporarily repaired by 7 July, and returned to Charleston Navy Yard on 15 July. ===World War I=== America's entry into World War I saw Terry undergoing extensive repairs at Charleston. Upon completion, she began patrolling under Lieutenant John F. Shafroth Jr. along the Atlantic coast and escorting merchantmen bound for Europe. In January 1918, Terry put to sea for operations with the destroyer force based at Queenstown, Ireland. There, she escorted convoys through the submarine-infested waters surrounding the British Isles. Her tour of duty at Queenstown was a relatively peaceful, though rigorous, one. While she never sighted a German U-boat nor engaged in combat operations, on one voyage she escorted a convoy which lost one ship to a submarine. On another occasion, 19 March 1918, she assisted with casualties after that destroyer was damaged by an accidental depth charge explosion. ==United States Coast Guard== In December 1918, Terry returned to the United States, and after 11 months of extremely limited service, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 November 1919.

He was a scion of the Irish Taaffe noble dynasty, who held hereditary titles from two countries: Imperial Counts (Reichsgrafen) of the Holy Roman Empire and viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland (in the United Kingdom). ==Family background and early years== Taaffe Coat of Arms Taaffe was the second son of Count Louis Taaffe, 9th Viscount Taaffe (1791‚Äì1855), Austrian Minister of Justice during the Revolutions of 1848 and president of the court of appeal. His ancestor Francis Taaffe, 3rd Earl of Carlingford (1639‚Äì1704) had entered the service of the Habsburg Monarchy in the 17th century; the family held large estates in Bohemia. As a child, Eduard Taaffe was one of the chosen companions of the young Archduke Francis Joseph, who in 1848 was crowned Emperor of Austria. That connection led to a distinguished political career for Taafe in the service of the Habsburgs. He studied law at the University of Vienna and entered public service in 1852. From 1861 he served at the Bohemian crown land government in Prague and in 1863 was appointed Landespr√§sident (stadtholder) in the Duchy of Salzburg. He backed the implementation of the February Patent constitution under State Minister Anton von Schmerling and in 1864 became a member of the Bohemian Diet (Landtag), where he did however not excel. In 1867 the Chairmen of the Ministers' Conference Count Richard Belcredi appointed him Upper Austrian stadtholder at Linz. By the death of his elder brother Charles (1823‚Äì1873), colonel in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Eduard Graf von Taaffe succeeded to the Irish titles. He had married Countess Irma Tsaky in 1862, by whom he left four daughters and one son, Henry. == Political life == ===Minister-President (first term)=== During the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Emperor Francis Joseph offered him the post of Minister of the Interior in Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust's cabinet. In June he became vice-president of the ministry, and at the end of the year he entered the first ministry (B√ºrgerministerium) of the newly organized Austrian portion of the monarchy. For the next three years he took a notable part in the confused political changes, and probably more than any other politician represented the wishes of the emperor. Taaffe had entered the ministry as a German Liberal, but he soon took an intermediate position between the Liberal majority of the B√ºrgerministerium (\\"Citizen's Ministry\\" because it was mainly commoners) and the party which desired a federal constitution and which was strongly supported at court. From September 1868 to January 1870, after the retirement of Auersperg, he was president of the cabinet. In 1870, the government fell on the question of the revision of the constitution: Taaffe with Potocki and Johann Nepomuk Berger wished to make some concessions to the Federalists; the Liberal majority wished to preserve undiminished the authority of the Imperial Council. The two parties presented memoranda to the emperor, each defending their view and offering their resignation: after some hesitation the emperor accepted the policy of the majority, and Taaffe with his friends resigned. Bascom Barry Hayes. Bismarck and Mitteleuropa. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1994, 9780838635124. === Second term === Count Eduard Taaffe The Liberals, however, failed to form a new government, as the representatives of most of the territories refused to appear in the Imperial Council: they resigned, and in the month of April Potocki and Taaffe returned to office. The latter failed, however, in an attempt to come to an understanding with the Czechs, and in their turn they had to make way for the Clerical and Federalist cabinet of Hohenwart. Taaffe now became governor of Tyrol, but in 1879, on the collapse of the Liberal government, he was recalled to high office. At first, he attempted to carry on the government without a change of principles, but he soon found it necessary to come to an understanding with the Feudal and Federal parties and was responsible for the conduct of the negotiations which in the elections of the same year gave a majority to the different groups of the National and Clerical opposition. In July he became minister president: at first he still continued to govern with the Liberals, but this was soon made impossible, and he was obliged to turn for support to the Conservatives. Legislation to help the working class emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in state economic matters. In Germany Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had used such policies to neutralize socialist promises. The Catholics studied the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 that limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.Margarete Grandner, \\"Conservative Social Politics in Austria, 1880‚Äì1890.\\" Austrian History Yearbook 27 (1996): 77-107. === Election reform of 1882 === Count Taaffe is mostly remembered for his election reform of 1882, which reduced to 5 guilders the minimum tax base required for men over the age of 24 to vote. Before this reform, the tax base was set locally, but was usually at a considerably higher level, so that only 6% of the male population of Cisleithania had been entitled to vote. However, even after this reform, there were still four classes of voters whose vote counted differently, depending on how much tax an individual was paying. The next election reform was enacted in 1896 by Kasimir Felix Graf Badeni, who succeeded in bringing about more radical reforms than Taaffe had achieved. === Policies on nationalities === It was Taaffe's great achievement that he persuaded the Czechs to abandon the policy of abstention and to take part in the parliament. It was on the support of them, the Poles, and the Clericals that his majority depended. His avowed intention was to unite the nationalities of Austria: Germans and Slavs were, as he said, equally integral parts of Austria; neither must be oppressed; both must unite to form an Austrian parliament. Notwithstanding the growing opposition of the German Liberals, who refused to accept the equality of the nationalities, he kept his position for thirteen years. == Late years == In 1893 he was defeated on a proposal for the revision of the franchise, and resigned. He retired into private life, and died two years later at his country residence, Ellischau, in Bohemia. == Notes == ==Further reading== * Grandner, Margarete. \\"Conservative Social Politics in Austria, 1880‚Äì1890.\\" Austrian History Yearbook 27 (1996): 77-107. * Taylor, A.J.P.

She also authored the memoir, Father Struck It Rich, together with Boyden Sparkes. ==Early life== Evalyn was born on August 1, 1886, in Leadville, Colorado, the only daughter of Carrie Bell Reed, a former schoolteacher, and Thomas Walsh, an Irish immigrant miner and prospector. She had one sibling, a brother, Vinson Walsh (1888‚Äì1905), who died in a car accident in Newport, Rhode Island, when he was 17 years old. When she was twelve years old, her father discovered a gold mine and became a multimillionaire. The family moved to a large mansion on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. At the age of fourteen, Evalyn moved to Paris for singing lessons. Instead she lived a wild life, coloring her hair and drinking alcohol. She began adding rouge to her cheeks to adopt the look of prostitutes. ==The Hope Diamond== On January 28, 1911, in a deal made in the offices of The Washington Post, McLean's husband purchased the Hope Diamond for $189,000 () from Pierre Cartier of Cartier Jewelers in New York. The Hope Diamond was traditionally associated with a curse, but no tragic events befell the couple until eight years later.

In January 1980, she sold the mansion to Yoko Ono and John Lennon. She turned down the Hope Diamond in 1952, when offered to her by her husband, after his mother's death, due to the alleged \\"curse\\" associated with it.\\"LENNON MANSION BRINGS $3.5 MILLION\\", by Julie Eagle,South Florida SunSentinel, February 6, 1986.

Gregory, with whom she had two children. *Edward Beale McLean, Jr., married Ann Carroll Meem, in May 1938. Their divorce was granted in July 1943 and, in August, he married actress Gloria Hatrick, with whom he had two sons, Ronald and Michael. Ronald died, in 1969, from enemy fire, while serving in Vietnam as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. McLean and Hatrick divorced in January 1948 and, that October, McLean married Manuela Mercedes \\"Mollie\\" Hudson, who had been the first wife of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. In August 1949, Gloria married actor James Stewart. McLean Jr. and Hudson-Vanderbilt separated in the 1960s, then divorced in 1973, after which he married a fourth time, to Patricia Dewey.Nashua, New Hampshire Telegraph, August 9, 1949 The site of the McLean home, Friendship -- a sprawling country mansion built for her father-in-law by John Russell Pope and which was located on Tenleytown Road, N.W. -- is now a condominium complex known as McLean Gardens. The original house was demolished in the 1940s though some of the property's garden features remain intact, as does the Georgian- style ballroom. A later residence, also known as Friendship, is located at the corner of R Street, N.W. and Wisconsin Avenue, and remains a private home. Her childhood home, a grandiose Second Empire-style mansion at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., is now the Indonesian embassy. McLean was a friend and confidante to Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Florence Harding, the wife of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. McLean and Harding frequented movie theaters and played bridge together and had a close relationship.Anthony 1998, p. 136 McLean and her husband made a highly- publicised journey to Russia, shortly after the October Revolution, in an effort to get Ned's uncle, George Bakhmeteff, reinstated as the Russian ambassador to the US. An American diplomat, William Bullitt, had to talk McLean out of flaunting the Hope Diamond on the streets of Moscow as a symbol of the superiority of capitalism. McLean was a victim of Gaston Means, a former BOI agent, murder suspect, and grifter, who claimed he had set a deal to free the Lindbergh baby for a ransom of over US$100,000, which Evalyn McLean advanced him. Means disappeared with the money, only to resurface months later in California, and ask McLean for additional funds. Suspicious of Means' activities, she helped lead police to him; he was also wanted for various other crimes and civil actions. That ultimately led to his conviction and imprisonment on larceny charges. Edward McLean eventually died in a mental institution in 1941. ===Death and estate=== On April 26, 1947, Evalyn Walsh McLean, aged 60, died of pneumonia, and was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington D.C., in the Walsh family tomb, alongside her daughter. The Reverend Edmund Walsh, S.J. vice president of Georgetown University read her funeral service, which was attended by family, and close friends including United States Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy. Upon her death, the principal of her estate and her jewelry, including the Hope Diamond, were left to her seven grandchildren, to be managed by four trustees until the five oldest grandchildren passed their twenty-fifth birthdays. The trustees were: *Frank Murphy, United States Supreme Court Justice *Thurman Arnold, former Assistant Attorney General *Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen, American bishop and later archbishop of the Catholic Church *The Reverend Edmund Walsh, S.J. vice president of Georgetown University Her sons, however, received the proceeds of the Walsh Trust, which was established by her father Thomas Walsh, who had died in 1910. She gave her son-in-law, the former United States Senator Robert Rice Reynolds, lifetime use of the McLean home, Friendship. If the home was sold by the Trustees, he was to receive the proceeds of the sale for his own use. ==In popular culture== Her highly-promoted trip to the Russian SFSR is mentioned in the Cole Porter song, \\"Anything Goes\\", in the lines \\"When Mrs Ned McLean (God bless her) / Can get Russian reds to \\"yes\\" her, / Then I suppose / Anything goes.\\" ==References== ==External links== *The Hope Diamond, PBS *The Thomas Walsh Mansion, Embassy Row, Washington DC *Queen of Diamonds, Joseph Gregory McLean *The World of Famous Diamonds * *The Notorious Hope Diamond Category:1886 births Category:1947 deaths Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Burials at Rock Creek Cemetery Category:People from Lake County, Colorado Category:American socialites Category:McLean family (United States) ","title":"Evalyn Walsh McLean"},{"id":"1295284","text":"Fuel-rich staged combustion cycle. Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas. After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer. The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine. In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages. The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity. Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber. In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant. In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust. The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. The staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing. ==History== Staged combustion (') was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.George Sutton, \\"History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\\", 2006 About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket. The non-cryogenic N2O4/UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket. After the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant. Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing. Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.Cosmodrome History Channel, interviews with Aerojet and Kuznetsov engineers about the history of staged combustion The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle. Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets. The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2019. The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow. Hydrogen peroxide/kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. The RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight. ==Variants== Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center. In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber. Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist. Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich. The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners. The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion. Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin- shaft. In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. Examples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners. Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor. Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps. In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation. For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap- off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner. ===Full-flow staged combustion cycle=== Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners. The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name. The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. Benefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability. Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines. Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber. This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency. Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. As of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government-funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019. The first flight test of a full-flow staged-combustion engine occurred on 25 July 2019 when SpaceX flew their Raptor methalox FFSC engine at their South Texas Launch Site. ==Applications== ===Oxidizer-rich staged combustion=== *S1.5400‚ÄîFirst staged combustion rocket engine used on the Blok L upper stage. *NK-33‚ÄîSoviet engine developed for the never-flown upgraded version of the N-1 launch vehicle.

Eugen \\"Jen≈ë\\" Varga studied philosophy and economic geography at the University of Budapest. In 1906, he started writing in socialist and academic journals, mainly on economic subjects, but also on other topics. Before World War I he gained some fame by discussing with Otto Bauer about the origins of inflation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this period he belonged to the Marxist Centrists, of whom Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding were the most prominent spokesmen. ===Hungarian revolution=== He participated as minister of finance in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919. After the overthrow of the Soviet Republic he fled to Vienna. ===Soviet emigration=== In 1920 he went to the Soviet Union with Arthur Holitscher. Here he started working for the Comintern, specializing in international economic problems and agrarian questions. In years 1922-1927 he was working at the department of trade in the Soviet embassy in Berlin. In the 1930s he became an economic adviser to Joseph Stalin. He survived the purges of the 1930s. During World War II he advised the Soviet Government in matters of post-war reparations. He attended the Potsdam Conference of 1945 as an expert. Like most of his compatriots living and working in Moscow, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but he also remained active in the Hungarian Communist Party. He authored the economic reports the congresses of the Comintern discussed between 1921 and 1935. A large number of his writings were studies of the international economic conjuncture, in which he made great effort to assess quantitative trends in output, investment and employment using official economic data from numerous countries. He also extensively studied German imperialism. In 1946 he published The Economic Transformation of Capitalism at the End of the Second World War, in which he argued that the capitalist system was more inherently stable than had been hitherto believed. This led to the closure of the Institute which he headed. (See: Paolo Spriano, Stalin and the European Communists. London: Verso, 1985). Finally, in 1949 he would make his self- criticism. Though he remained a leading academic economist, his prestige had diminished. In the second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia he was qualified as a \\"bourgeois economist.\\" ===Years after Stalin=== After Stalin's death in 1953, he reappeared on the scene, but the new men in power in the Kremlin believing in the virtues of peaceful co-existence were not interested in Varga's predictions of the outbreak of a \\"necessary\\" economic crisis in the United States. In 1954 and 1959 he received the Lenin Orders, in 1954 he obtained a Stalin Prize and in 1963 a Lenin Prize. After his death, his selected works in three volumes were published in the Soviet Union, Hungary, and East Germany. Varga never returned to living in his native Hungary. Because he was very close to M√°ty√°s R√°kosi, he was several times invited as an economic advisor to Hungary. In this period (1945-1950) he had specialized in economic planning, pricing and monetary reforms, i.e. reforms the Hungarian Communists now in power were carrying out. After the fall of R√°kosi caused by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the take-over by the K√°d√°r team, Varga's advisory work was not appreciated anymore. ==Footnotes== == Further reading == * Gerhard Duda, Jeno Varga und die Geschichte des Instituts f√ºr Weltwirtschaft und Weltpolitik in Moskau 1921-1970.

Captured and tortured by the Germans, Potier committed suicide. ==World War II service== In May 1940, Potier was Capitaine-Commandant in the Belgian airforce. With the outbreak of World War II, Potier travelled across France, Spain and Portugal and arrived in England in March 1942. At age 39, he was rejected by the RAF as too old for active flying duties. He then joined MI9 and in July 1943 was parachuted into southeast Belgium (Province of Luxembourg) near Suxy, accompanied by a Canadian radio operator Conrad Lafleur. At this time, many allied aircrew, on bombing raids to Germany, were being shot down over the Belgian Ardennes. Potier's mission, known as Mission Martin in Belgium and the Possum Line in France, was to organise the recovery of these airmen and shelter, feed and provide them with false identity documents, before moving them to safe houses in and around Reims in Northern France. Unlike the Ardennes, this area was suitable for evacuation by air, using Lysander aircraft. Between August and December 1943, three successful operations took place repatriating eleven airmen and one SOE agent. The organisation also provided for and escorted airmen to the Brittany coast, in November 1943, for rescue by sea; an operation organised by the Jade-Fitzroy network. Possum operated safehouses in Paris, allowing evaders to be passed on to the Com√®te organisation. The two organisations in many ways supplemented each other's activities. There are no records, but it is estimated some 60‚Äì70 airmen had passed through or were being sheltered by Possum. After returning to England for a period, Potier was parachuted back into France on 20 December. On 28 December, Lafleur was transmitting messages to London, when he was surprised by the Germans. He escaped, but it was the start of a sequence of events that eventually led to the arrest of Potier. Initially he was taken to Fresnes prison in Paris, then returned to Reims, where after being subjected to considerable torture, he committed suicide on 11 January 1944. As more arrests followed, the organisation around Reims effectively collapsed. Of the 70 network members arrested in the French sector of Possum, some 60 were deported. Less than half returned. ==Reburial== Potier's remains were exhumed from Reims and, on 18 September 1950, he was reburied with full military honours in the Pelouse d'Honneur A√©rienne, Cimeti√®re Communal de B-1140 Bruxelles-Ev√®re. ==External links== *Le r√©seau d'√©vasion Possum *The Possum Escape Line *Conscript- heroes.com Category:1903 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Belgian military personnel of World War II Category:People from Seraing Category:Belgian Air Component officers ","title":"Edgard Potier"},{"id":"1295385","text":"Alfred von Arneth Alfred Ritter von Arneth (10 July 181930 July 1897) was an Austrian historian. His principal scholarly work is a ten-volume biography of the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa, first published in installments from 1863 to 1879 and still regarded as the standard work on the subject. Born at Vienna, he was the son of Joseph Calasanza von Arneth (1791‚Äì1863), a well- known historian and archaeologist, who wrote a history of the Austrian Empire (Vienna, 1827) and several works on numismatics and brother of Doctor Franz Hektor von Arneth (1818‚Äì1907). ==Life== Alfred Arneth studied law, and became an official of the Austrian state archives, of which in 1868 he was appointed keeper. He was a moderate liberal in politics and a supporter of German unity. As such he was elected to the Frankfurt parliament in 1848. In 1861 he became a member of the Lower Austrian diet and in 1869 was nominated to the Upper House of the Austrian Reichsrat. In 1879 he was appointed president of the Kaiserliche Academie der Wissenschaften (Academy of Sciences) at Vienna, and in 1896 succeeded von Sybel as chairman of the historical commission at Munich. Von Arneth was an indefatigable worker, and, as director of the archives, his willingness to listen to the advice of experts, as well as his own sound sense, reportedly helped to promote the more scientific treatment and use of public records in most of the archives of Europe. He was noted for his scientific temper and for drawing from original sources.

Its mission statement lists abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and assisted suicide, as its areas of concern. In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked (then Rev.) James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in the reform of policy on abortion. The National Right to Life Committee was founded in 1967 as the \\"Right to Life League\\" to coordinate its state campaigns under the auspices of the NCCB.\\"God's Own Party: The Making of the Religious Right\\", pp. 113‚Äì116. . Daniel K. Williams. Oxford University Press. 2010. To appeal to a more broad- based, nonsectarian movement, crucial Minnesotan leaders proposed an organizational constitution that would separate the NRLC from the direct supervision of the NCCB, and by early 1973 NRLC Director (then Rev.) James T. McHugh and his executive assistant, Michael Taylor, proposed a different plan to move the NRLC toward independence from the Catholic Church. ==Organization== The national organization of National Right to Life comprises the: * National Right to Life Committee, Inc. (NRLC), 501c(4), EIN: 52-0986196; * National Right to Life Committee Educational Trust Fund, 501c(3), EIN: 52-1241126; * National Right to Life Educational Foundation, Inc., 501c(3), EIN: 73-1010913; * National Right to Life Conventions, Inc., 501c(4), EIN: 52-1257773; * National Right to Life Political Action Committee (NRLPAC); and * National Right to Life Victory Fund, an independent expenditure political action committee, i. e., a \\"SuperPAC\\". ==History== ===National Conference of Catholic Bishops: 1968‚Äì73=== In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked (then Rev.) James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in the reform of policy on abortion. At the time then Fr. McHugh was Director of the United States Catholic Conference (USCC) Family Life Bureau, and later became the Bishop of Camden and then of Rockville Centre. The NCCB asked Fr. McHugh during its annual conference in April 1967 to organize the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and fund the established NRLC with $50,000 to \\"initiate and coordinate a program of information\\" with state affiliates that would inform stakeholders of the wave of proposed state legislation to liberalize statutes prohibiting abortion. The National Right to Life Committee was formalized in 1968. McHugh hired executive assistant Michael Taylor to help with the day to day needs of the organization. In October 1968, they published the first NRLC newsletter formally introducing the organization and providing information on the efforts to change abortion laws. On the state level, independent right to life organizations were beginning to form and began to rely on NRLC for direction and information. The newsletter lasted until 1971. NRLC held its first meeting of nationwide anti-abortion leaders in Chicago, Illinois in 1970 at Barat College. New Jersey attorney Juan Ryan served as the first President of NRLC. In the following year NRLC held its first convention at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. \\"The only reason that we have a pro-life movement in this country is because of the Catholic people and the Catholic Church\\", stated the Executive Director of NRLC in 1973.\\"God's Own Party: The Making of the Religious Right\\", p. 116. . Daniel K. Williams. Oxford University Press. 2010. ===Incorporation and Human Life Amendment=== The NRLC was formally incorporated in May 1973, in response to the Roe v. Wade ruling of the US Supreme Court and the desire to separate from the Catholic Church to attract more Protestants to the organization. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops launched a campaign to amend the United States Constitution by enacting a Human Life Amendment that not only invalidated Roe v. Wade but also prohibited both the US Congress and the States from legalizing abortion in the United States. Its first convention as an incorporated organization was held the following month in Detroit, Michigan. At the concurrent meeting of NRLC's Board, Ed Golden of New York was elected President. Among the founding members was Mildred Jefferson, the first African-American woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. Jefferson subsequently served as President in 1975. ===Schism forms the American Life League=== In 1978, NRLC found itself $100,000 in debt after Jefferson's presidency. Rather than acknowledge her record, she left the organization to form the Right to Life Crusade. On April 1, 1979, the American Life League (ALL) was foundedhttp://www.clmagazine.org/article/index/id/MTM1NDE A saintly influence: Pope John Paul II's impact on American Life League‚Äîand me. Judie Brown. Celebrate Life Magazine. by Judie Brown, former public relations director of NRLC, and 9 others after a schism within the NRLC. Within less than a year of its foundation, ALL had 68,000 members and received assistance from Howard Phillips, publicity from Paul Weyrich, a co-founder of Heritage Foundation, and the benefits of extensive lists of membership provided by the direct mail specialist Richard Viguerie. === Media publicity === Since its incorporation, the NRLC prioritized its politics over getting publicity due to its concern of being portrayed in a poor light and lack of funds. But by 1980 NRLC's annual budget increased to $1,600,000 and retained a membership of 11 million, allowing the organization to invest in media strategy and established its media department in 1984. The organization worked quickly and in 1985 had a communications department that produced and distributed a radio program, media campaigns, and maintained press connections. Its media strategy worked to create a public image that differentiated the NRCL from allies by using medical professionals, including its president and primary spokesperson Dr. John Willke, to lend legitimacy and hiring a young African-American woman. One hallmark of their media campaign was utilizing the slogan \\"Love them Both\\" which embraced claims of women's rights and welfare through compassion to gain the support of those ambivalent on the issue. In 1995, the NRLC coined the term \\"partial-birth\\" abortion to describe a new medical procedure also known as \\"dilation and extraction,\\" or D&X;, and \\"intact D&E;\\" in which the fetus is removed intact from the uterus after 20 weeks gestation. The organization illustrated and published drawings of the procedure in booklets and paid newspaper advertisements to create public opposition of both the procedure and abortion in general. The NRCL was later critical of President Clinton's 1995 veto of a bill that would ban the procedure. The phrase was later used in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. Efforts paid off and in 1992 and 1998, Fortune magazine recognized the NRLC as the most publicly recognized and politically effective anti-abortion organization. In 1999, Fortune ranked them as the 8th most influential public policy group working in Washington, DC. ===The Silent Scream=== In 1984 the Committee co-produced the documentary The Silent Scream on abortion with Bernard Nathanson. In 1985, following 2 years of a boycott of a product of the Upjohn Company that NRLC coordinated, the Company ceased all research on abortifacient drugs. Three years later, NRLC joined other anti-abortion organizations in notifying drug companies that if any company sold an abortifacient drug the millions of Americans who opposed abortion would boycott all the products of that company.\\"Boycott Threat Blocking Sale of Abortion-Inducing Drug\\" New York Times ===NRLC boycott of Hoechst Marion Roussel and Altace=== In the 1990s the NRLC began a nationwide grassroots lobbying campaign against the Freedom of Choice Act, and announced a boycott of the French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf and its American affiliates for permitting its abortion drug, mifepristone, into the United States. The U.S. National Right to Life Committee announced a 1994 U.S. boycott of all Hoechst pharmaceutical products including Altace, targeting the abortion pill RU-486.http://www.ewtn.com/library/PROLIFE/RUBOYCOT.TXT Now's the Time to Defend Our Borders - A Pro-Life Boycott Could Keep RU 486 out of the U.S. According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the language of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the term \\"partial birth abortion\\" was developed in early 1995 at a meeting of herself, Charles T. Canady, and NRLC lobbyist Douglas Johnson.Gorney, Cynthia. Gambling With Abortion . Harper's Magazine, November 2004. The phrase elicited strong negative reactions from a focus group and became a key phrase in NRLC's attack on abortion. ==Affiliates== Its Virginia affiliate, the Virginia Society for Human Life, was founded in 1967 as the first state right to life organization.

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps. The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs. A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure. Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps. A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks. Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened. If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter. Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves. They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. Care must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures. The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state. It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel. Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs. Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module. Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines. These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. Pressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity. The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable. Other vehicles or companies using pressure- fed engine: *OTRAG (rocket) *Quad (rocket) of Armadillo Aerospace *XCOR EZ- Rocket of XCOR Aerospace *Masten Space Systems *Aquarius Launch Vehicle *NASA's Project Morpheus prototype lander *NASA Mighty Eagle mini lunar lander *CONAE's Tronador II upper stage ==See also== *Gas-generator cycle *Combustion tap-off cycle *Expander cycle *Staged combustion cycle ==References== ==External links== *Rocket power cycles Category:Rocket propulsion Category:Rocket engines Category:Thermodynamics ","title":"Pressure-fed engine"},{"id":"1295416","text":"Dini may refer to: == Places == *Dini Ya Msambwa, African traditional religion, labeled as an anti-colonial ; Iran *Ala ol Dini-ye Olya, a village in Eslamabad Rural District, in the Central District of Jiroft County, Kerman Province *Kamal ol Din, Bardsir, a village in Mashiz Rural District, in the Central District of Bardsir County, Kerman Province *Nur ol Dini,a village in Kheyrgu Rural District, Alamarvdasht District, Lamerd County, Fars Province *Tang-e Baha ol Dini, a village in Howmeh Rural District, in the Central District of Larestan County, Fars Province *Tolombeh-ye Rokn ol Dini, a village in Arzuiyeh Rural District, in the Central District of Arzuiyeh County, Kerman Province *Zeyn ol Dini, a village in Kal Rural District, Eshkanan District, Lamerd County, Fars Province == People == *Abdi Dini (born 1981), professional Canadian wheelchair basketball player *Abdulkadir Sheikh Dini, Somali politician and military officia *Ahmed Dini Ahmed (1932-2004), Djiboutian politician *Andrea Dini (born 1996), Italian football player *Dino Dini, English games developer *Joe Dini (1929-2014), Nevada state assemblyman and casino owner *Lamberto Dini, Italian politician *Lorenzo Dini (born 1994), Italian long-distance runner *Mohamed Dini Farah, Djiboutian politician *Mohammed Nuru Dini (born 1987), Ghanaian football player *Muguette Dini, French politician *Nh.

He was known for his work in geometry, particularly in enumerative geometry and the singularity theory of algebraic curves, in algebraic geometry. He also worked on invariant theory and projective differential geometry. ==Biography== He did his studies at √âcole Polytechnique (X 1862), where he graduated in 1866. He continued his education at √âcole d'Application de l'Artillerie et du G√©nie de Metz. As a lieutenant of Artillery he was sent Auxonne first and then to Strasbourg. In 1872, Halphen settled in Paris, where he became a lecturer at the √âcole Polytechnique and began his scientific studies. He completed his dissertation in 1878. In 1872 he married Rose Marguerite Aron, with whom he had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Of the four sons, three joined the military and two of them died in World War I. Louis Halphen (1880-1950) was a French historian specialized in medivial times; Charles Halphen (1885-1915), was deputy secretary of the Soci√©t√© math√©matique de France. One of his grandsons was √âtienne Halphen (1911‚Äì1954), who did significant work in applied statistics. ==Awards== Georges-Henri Halphen received in the Steiner prize of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1880 along with Max Noether. In 1881 Halphen received the Grand Prix of the Acad√©mie des sciences for his work on linear differential equations: M√©moire sur la Reduction des Equations Diff√©rentielles Lin√©aires aux Formes Int√©grales. He received the Prix Poncelet in 1883 and the Prix Petit d'Ormoy in 1885.

Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded. Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling. The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine. Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps. The gas is then exhausted. Because something is \\"thrown away\\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle. There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle. The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber. This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine. The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles. However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine. This is seen in the F-1 rocket engine used on the Saturn V booster stage. As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas- generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling). The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity. Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines. Engines using this system are mechanically simple, but have poor specific impulse. ==Usage== Gas-generator combustion engines include the following: *Vulcain, HM7B *Merlin *RS-68 *RS-27A *J-2X *F-1 *RD-107 *CE-20 Rocket launch systems that use gas- generator combustion engines: *Ariane 5 *Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy *Delta IV *Saturn V *Soyuz (rocket family) *Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle III *Long March 3B, Long March 2F == See also == * Combustion tap-off cycle * Expander cycle * Pressure-fed engine * Rocket engine * Staged combustion cycle == References == == External links == * Rocket power cycles * Rocket-Engine Cooling at NASA Category:Combustion Category:Rocket engines Category:Spacecraft propulsion Category:Thermodynamic cycles ","title":"Gas-generator cycle"},{"id":"1295472","text":"Gordon Thomas Calthrop Campbell, Baron Campbell of Croy, (8 June 1921 - 26 April 2005) was a British Conservative politician and diplomat. == Biography == === Early life and career === Campbell was born in Quetta, British India (now in Pakistan), the son of Major General James Alexander Campbell and was educated at Rockport School in Holywood, County Down, then at Wellington College before joining the Royal Artillery in 1939. He fought in the Second World War with the Royal Artillery from 1940, winning the Military Cross and Bar. Invalided out in 1947 with the honorary rank of major, he served the Foreign Office in New York and Vienna until 1957. === House of Commons === Elected to Parliament in 1959, he served as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Moray and Nairn until February 1974 when he was defeated by Winnie Ewing of the Scottish National Party. He served as a Government Whip, 1961‚Äì62; Lord Commissioner of the Treasury and Scottish Whip, 1962‚Äì63; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, 1963‚Äì64. He was Opposition Spokesman on Defence, 1967‚Äì68 and a member of the Shadow Cabinet, 1969‚Äì70. === Secretary of State for Scotland === He was Secretary of State for Scotland during the whole of Edward Heath's government. During his term in office the issues of fishing and oil led to him losing his Moray coastal seat to the SNP. Government papers released under the 30 year rule reveal an attitude that may explain that loss. Papers from 1970 revealed how the Scottish Office was prepared to have a \\"weaker and less efficient national fleet\\" to enable the UK to sign up to the controversial Common Fisheries Policy. On oil in 1972 Campbell was against any move to pump oil revenues directly into the Scottish economy despite Heath asking government departments to explore such an arrangements to help revive Scotland's economy with \\"its own resources\\". Further papers from 1974 revealed how he proposed \\"exceptional measures\\" to force Shetland Islands Council to accept an oil terminal without financial benefit to the islands. === House of Lords === After being defeated by Winnie Ewing of the Scottish National Party at the February 1974 general election, Campbell was made a life peer as Baron Campbell of Croy, of Croy in the County of Nairn on 9 January 1975. He became Chairman of the Scottish Board in 1976, and was Vice President of the Advisory Committee on Pollution at Sea from 1976 to 1984. ===Personal life=== He married Nicola Madan, daughter of Geoffrey Spencer Madan and his wife Marjorie Noble, and had three children. * Hon.

The Hong Kong Observatory is the official timekeeper of the Hong Kong Time. ==Time standards== In Hong Kong, Hong Kong Time is defined in the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap 1), Laws of Hong Kong. Section 67(2) of the Ordinance states that: > \\"Hong Kong Time\\" () means the time used for general purposes throughout Hong > Kong namely, 8 hours, or such other period as may be determined by the > Legislative Council by resolution under this subsection or under section 16 > of the Oil (Conservation and Control) Ordinance (Cap 264), in advance of > Universal Standard Time.section 67 of the Interpretation and General Clauses > Ordinance , Laws of Hong Kong. Currently, Hong Kong time is defined as UTC+08:00. The reference in section 67(2) to the Oil (Conservation and Control) Ordinance is actually a power given to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to change Hong Kong Time for the purposes of conserving oil, i.e. to implement daylight saving time. However, no daylight saving time has been observed since 1979. The Hong Kong Time was first set to Local Mean Time (GMT+07:36:42) on 1 January 1885 at 13:00 by the then Royal Observatory Hong Kong. In 1904, the Greenwich Mean Time was adopted as the basis for Hong Kong Time, the time was set at 8 hours in advance of Greenwich Mean Time. The current Coordinated Universal Time system was adopted as an official time standard on 1 January 1972. However, the legal Hong Kong Time still remained based on Greenwich Mean Time until it was changed to Universal Standard Time in 1998section 25 of the Adaptation of Laws (Interpretative Provisions) Ordinance (26 of 1998) , Laws of Hong Kong. after the Hong Kong handover. ==Timekeeping== The time ball in front of Marine Police Headquarters Compound, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon circa 1908.The time ball tower at Blackhead Point in 1908.From 1885, Hong Kong Time was determined by astronomical observations at the Hong Kong Observatory using a 6-inch equatorial mount and a 3-inch Transit Circle. The time was announced to the general public, particularly mariners, by dropping a 6-feet diameter time ball from a mast exactly at 13:00 daily in front the Marine Police Headquarters Compound, where it is visible from the Victoria Harbour. In January 1908, the time ball was relocated to the hill of Blackhead Point where it had even higher visibility. With the rise of radio broadcast and the launching of Radio Hong Kong in 1922, the importance of the time ball decreased. It was decommissioned on 30 June 1933. During the Second World War, the equatorial mount and transit circle were lost. After the war, a pendulum clock was installed and regulated by radio time signals from other timekeeping centres. Timing accuracy gradually improved from the daily engineering tolerance of a few seconds to one-fifth of a second. In 1966, the pendulum clock in the Royal Observatory Hong Kong was replaced by a crystal oscillator timing system. In the same year, the Royal Observatory started to broadcast the time directly with a 6-pip time signal on 95 MHz. This continued until 16 September 1989. In 1980, the Royal Observatory adopted a timing system based on a Caesium beam atomic clock. This system narrowed the engineering tolerance down to less than 1 millisecond. The frequency standard of the clock is based on the primary standard used by Japan's Communications Research Laboratory. In 1994, the atomic clock was replaced with a newer model. Current Hong Kong Time can be obtained from the Observatory's Network Time Server. ==Daylight Saving== Hong Kong adopted daylight saving measures in 1941.

He studied medicine at Greifswald and Berlin, and was appointed an associate professor of anatomy at Halle in 1854. Five years later he became a full professor of anatomy and histology and director of the Anatomical Institute at the University of Bonn.\\"Schultze, Max(imilian) Johann Sigismund\\", in Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB). Band 23, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 2007, , pp. 703 ff. He died in Bonn on 16 January 1874; his successor at the anatomical institute being Adolph von La Valette-St. George. He was the older brother of obstetrician Bernhard Sigmund Schultze (1827‚Äì1919). He founded, in 1865, and edited the important \\"Archiv f√ºr mikroskopische Anatomie\\", to which he contributed many papers, and he advanced the subject generally, by refining on its technical methods. His works included: *Beitr√§ge zur Naturgeschichte der Turbellarien (1851). *Uber den Organismus der Polythalamien (1854). *Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis der Landplanarien (1857). *Zur Kenntnis der elektrischen Organe der Fische (1858). *Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes, (In 1865 Schultze provided the first accurate description of the platelet). *Zur Anatomie und Physiologie der Retina (1866). His name is especially known for his work on the cell theory. Uniting F√©lix Dujardin's conception of animal sarcode with Hugo von Mohl's of vegetable protoplasma, he pointed out their identity, and included them under the common name of protoplasm, defining the cell as a nucleated mass of protoplasm with or without a cell wall (Das Protoplasma der Rhizopoden und der Pflanzenzellen; ein Beitr√§g zur Theorie der Zelle, 1863). Max Schultze studied medicine with the naturalist Fritz M√ºller, a German biologist and doctor who became a naturalized Brazilian. It was mainly because of his friendship and correspondence with Schultze that M√ºller to some extent was able to follow the debate in Europe about Darwin's theory of evolution. Max periodically sent him scientific literature, among which was Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and a small microscope manufactured in Berlin, by Friedrich Wilhelm Schiek (1857). Thanks to this microscope, M√ºller hypothesized from his own studies that \\"all higher Crustacea probably will be traceable to a Zoea ancestor\\". Based on these studies M√ºller also wrote his book F√ºr Darwin, in defense of Darwin's theories, corroborating the theory of natural selection. ==See also== * Schultze reagent ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1825 births Category:1874 deaths Category:German zoologists Category:German anatomists Category:German microbiologists Category:People from Freiburg im Breisgau Category:University of Greifswald alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Halle faculty Category:University of Bonn faculty Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Baden ","title":"Max Schultze"},{"id":"1295496","text":"Thomas Harvey \\"Sean\\" Bonniwell (August 16, 1940 ‚Äì December 20, 2011) was an American singer-songwriter/guitarist, who was known as the creative force behind the 1960s garage rock band, The Music Machine. Bonniwell was quoted in Richie Unterberger's 1998 book, Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll, as saying \\"Rock and roll was a teenager in the '60s, and I used that climate to express my confusion, my anger, at the injustice of the world.\\" ==Life and career== ===Early years to 1960s=== Bonniwell was born in San Jose, California. During his teens, Bonniwell was inspired to form a high school vocal group after hearing the song \\"Only You\\" by The Platters. After high school, Bonniwell's first serious musical incarnation was that of clean-cut pop-folk guitarist for the quartet The Wayfarers. The Wayfarers released three albums under the RCA label. As the folk music craze died out, Bonniwell sought to create music with \\"fuzz and fangs.\\" In 1965, he formed a trio called The Ragamuffins, which quickly grew into The Music Machine. Adopting Beatles-style moptop hair and all-black outfits (and Bonniwell's signature single black leather glove), Music Machine churned out a diversified style of garage rock. After the band debut's album spawned the successful single \\"Talk Talk\\" (1966), the original line-up broke apart. Bonniwell continued on with Music Machine, now signed to Warner Bros. Records and renamed The Bonniwell Music Machine (1967). Unhappy with the way things were going, Bonniwell sold the rights to the band name to his label to be released from their contract. In 1969, along with Mosaic Tweed and a duo consisting of Brad Truitt and Billy Woodruff, he was signed to the talent roster of Kevin Deverich and Associates run by Kevin Deverich.Record World, May 31, 1969 ‚Äì Page 56 New Deverich Complex Also that year, Bonniwell released a solo album (Close) on Capitol Records. This recording marked a change in identity for Bonniwell, who not only chose to make gentle, sensitive music (contrasting that for which he was known), but also chose to record under the name of T.S. Bonniwell. The recording received minor label support and displeased Bonniwell enough that he left the music industry altogether. He entered a period of spiritual quest and internal soul-searching, grew a beard, sold everything he owned, and drove around the US in a Volkswagen bus. ===1990s to 2000s=== In 1996, Bonniwell self-published a memoir called Talk Talk, which was later revised and re-titled Beyond The Garage, published by the small press Christian Vision. Several years later, Sundazed Records put out previously unreleased Music Machine material from the 1960s, along with demo recordings from The Ragamuffins. Bonniwell claimed to have written over 300 songs since 1970. In November 2004, Bonniwell embarked on his first European Tour, performing his hits with musicians from the US and Europe. In 2006, Bonniwell recorded his first new material in several years, as a guest musician appearing on a self-titled debut album by The Larksmen, a garage rock group from Los Angeles, California. He appeared on two songs entitled \\"Burn Like A Boy\\" (actually written back in 1967 for The Music Machine but never released) and \\"Out Of Darwin's Mind\\". ==Death== Bonniwell died on December 20, 2011, in Visalia, California, from lung cancer.

Hyman competed as a member of the U.S. Finswimming Team at the 8th World Championship held in Hungary during August 1996. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Hyman was only expected to contend for silver in women's 200-meter butterfly on the night of September 20, 2000, as Australian Susie O'Neill was expected to repeat her title (O'Neill had been undefeated in the 200-meter butterfly for the previous 3‚Äì4 years; and was swimming in her home country). Hyman was so shocked that she looked at the scoreboard three times just to make sure that she had won. Hyman's victory was largely credited to her expert use of the very difficult fish kick on turns.

He received a doctorate in materials science from Tampere University of Technology in Finland. After graduation he continued superconductor research at the university, in the Materials Science department, until his expulsion in 1997. After which he moved back to Moscow where it is reported that he took an engineering job. Since leaving Tampere in 1997 Podkletnov has avoided public contact or appearances. There is a report that he later returned to Tampere to work on superconductors at Tamglass Engineering Oy. ==Gravity shielding== According to the account Podkletnov gave to Wired reporter Charles Platt in a 1996 phone interview, during a 1992 experiment with a rotating superconducting disc: :\\"Someone in the laboratory was smoking a pipe, and the pipe smoke rose in a column above the superconducting disc. So we placed a ball-shaped magnet above the disc, attached to a balance. The balance behaved strangely. We substituted a nonmagnetic material, silicon, and still the balance was very strange. We found that any object above the disc lost some of its weight, and we found that if we rotated the disc, the effect was increased.\\" ===Public controversy=== Podkletnov's first peer-reviewed paper on the apparent gravity- modification effect, published in 1992, attracted little notice. In 1996, he submitted a longer paper, in which he claimed to have observed a larger effect (2% weight reduction as opposed to 0.3% in the 1992 paper) to the Journal of Physics D. This is believed to be substantially the same paper accepted for publication in 1996 by Journal of Physics D which was later withdrawn by the author. According to Platt, a member of the editorial staff, Ian Sample, leaked the submitted paper to Robert Matthews, the science correspondent for the British newspaper, the Sunday Telegraph. On September 1, 1996, Matthews's story broke, leading with the startling statement: \\"Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's first antigravity device.\\" In the ensuing furor, the director of the laboratory where Podkletnov was working issued a defensive statement that Podkletnov was working entirely on his own. Vuorinen, listed as the paper's coauthor, disavowed prior knowledge of the paper and claimed that the name was used without consent. Podkletnov himself complained that he had never claimed to block gravity, only to have reduced its effect. Podkletnov withdrew his second paper after it had been initially accepted. The resulting furor over the alleged claims in the withdrawn paper is reported to be the primary reason for his expulsion from his lab and the termination of his employment at the university. ===Attempted verification=== In a 1997 telephone interview with Charles Platt, Podkletnov insisted that his gravity-shielding work was reproduced by researchers at universities in Toronto and Sheffield, but none have come forward to acknowledge this. The Sheffield work is known to have only been intended as partial replication, aimed at observing any unusual effects which might be present, since the team involved lacked the necessary facilities to construct a large enough disc and the ability to duplicate the means by which the original disc was rotated. Podkletnov counters that the researchers in question have kept quiet \\"lest they be criticized by the mainstream scientific community\\". Podkletnov is reported to have visited the Sheffield team in 2000 and advised them on the conditions necessary to achieve his effect, conditions that they never achieved. In a BBC news item, it was alleged that researchers at Boeing were funding a project called GRASP (Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion) which would attempt to construct a gravity shielding device based on rotating superconductors, but a subsequent Popular Mechanics news item stated that Boeing had denied funding GRASP with company money, although Boeing acknowledged that it could not comment on \\"black projects\\". It is alleged that the GRASP proposal was presented to Boeing and Boeing chose not to fund it. In July 2002, an article by Nick Cook in Jane's Defence Weekly reported about Boeing's internal project GRASP ‚Äî Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion to evaluate the validity of Podkletnov's claims. The briefing obtained by Jane's says \\"If gravity modification is real, it will alter the entire aerospace business.\\" The briefing allegedly says that Boeing, as well as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin tried to approach Podkletnov directly and that \\"Podkletnov is strongly anti-military and will only provide assistance if the research is carried out in the ‚Äòwhite world‚Äô of open development.\\" ==Gravity beam== Also during the 1997 telephone interview with Platt, Podkletnov said that he was continuing to work on gravitation, claiming that with new collaborators at an unnamed \\"chemical research center\\" in Moscow he has built a new device. He said: :\\"Normally there are two spheres, and a spark jumps between them. Now imagine the spheres are flat surfaces, superconductors, one of them a coil or O-ring. Under specific conditions, applying resonating fields and composite superconducting coatings, we can organize the energy discharge in such a way that it goes through the center of the electrode, accompanied by gravitation phenomena - reflecting gravitational waves that spread through the walls and hit objects on the floors below, knocking them over...The second generation of flying machines will reflect gravity waves and will be small, light, and fast, like UFOs. I have achieved impulse reflection; now the task is to make it work continuously.\\" ==See also== * Anti-gravity * Ning Li ==References== ==External links== *Eugene Podkletnov on Antigravity A recounting of recent work claimed by supporters in 2014. *Russia's 'gravity-beating' scientist A BBC News profile on Podkletnov from 2002.

While a pupil at the gymnasium, he pursued botany and mineralogy in his leisure time, till in 1823 he entered the University of T√ºbingen. After graduating with distinction in medicine he went to Munich, where he met a distinguished circle of botanists, and found ample material for research. This seems to have determined his career as a botanist, and he started in 1828 those anatomical investigations which continued till his death. In 1832 he was appointed professor of botany in T√ºbingen, a post which he never left. Unmarried, his pleasures were in his laboratory and library, and in perfecting optical apparatus and microscopic preparations, for which he showed extraordinary manual skill. He was largely a self-taught botanist from boyhood, and, little influenced in his opinions even by his teachers, preserved always his independence of view on scientific questions. He received many honours during his lifetime, and was elected foreign fellow of the Royal Society in 1868. The process of cell division as observed under a microscope was first discovered by Hugo von Mohl in 1835 as he worked on green algae Cladophora glomerata. Mohl's writings cover a period of forty-four years; the most notable of them were republished in 1845 in a volume entitled Vermischte Schriften (For lists of his works see Botanische Zeitung, 1872, p. 576, and Royal Soc. Catalogue, 1870, vol. iv.) They dealt with a variety of subjects, but chiefly with the structure of the higher forms, including both rough anatomy and minute histology. The word protoplasm was his suggestion; the nucleus had already been recognized by R. Brown and others; but Mohl showed in 1844 that the protoplasm is the source of those movements which at that time excited so much attention. He recognized under the name of primordial utricle the protoplasmic lining of the vacuolated cell, and first described the behaviour of the protoplasm in cell division. These and other observations led to the overthrow of Schleiden's theory of origin of cells by free-cell-formation. His contributions to knowledge of the cell-wall were no less remarkable; he held the view now generally adopted of growth of cell-wall by apposition. He first explained the true nature of pits, and showed the cellular origin of vessels and of fibrous cells; he was, in fact, the true founder of the cell theory. Clearly the author of such researches was the man to collect into one volume the theory of cell-formation, and this he did in his treatise Die vegetabilische Zelle (1851), a short work translated into English (Ray Society, 1852). Mohl's early investigations on the structure of palms, of cycads, and of tree ferns permanently laid the foundation of all later knowledge of this subject: so also his work on Isoetes (1840). His later anatomical work was chiefly on the stems of dicotyledons and gymnosperms; in his observations on cork and bark he first explained the formation and origin of different types of bark, and corrected errors relating to lenticels. Following on his early demonstration of the origin of stomata (1838), he wrote a classical paper on their opening and closing (1850). In 1843 he started the weekly Botanische Zeitung in conjunction with Schlechtendal, which he edited jointly till his death. He was never a great writer of comprehensive works; no textbook exists in his name, and it would indeed appear from his withdrawal from co-operation in Hofmeister's Handbuch that he had a distaste for such efforts. In 1850, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In his latter years his productive activity fell off, doubtless through failing health, and he died suddenly at T√ºbingen on 1 April 1872. == References == * * * Proc. Roy.

Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role. The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III, who turned it into a grander property, designed to defend against a potential French attack, as well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London. Built on a soft hill of London clay, the castle has often been subject to subsidence; this, combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century, has led to it now being ruined. The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument. ==History== ===13th century=== Hadleigh Castle was first built by Hubert de Burgh, the 1st Earl of Kent, who was a key supporter of King John.Alexander and Westlake, p.9. De Burgh was given the honour of Rayleigh by John in 1215 as a reward for his services, but chose not to develop the existing caput of Rayleigh Castle, instead building a new fortification south of the town of Hadleigh. The exact date of construction is uncertain, but it is now believed the work was conducted early in de Burgh's tenure of the site, permission being retrospectively officially confirmed through a licence to crenellate in 1230 under Henry III. The site was chosen on top of the South Essex south ridge, overlooking the Thames estuary, formed from generally soft deposits of London clay.Alexander and Westlake, p.3. In the 13th century, marshlands would have stretched away to the south of the castle, with the tide occasionally reaching up as far as the base of the hill itself, and the area would have been more wooded than today.Alexander and Westlake, pp.3, 9. By 1235 the park of Hadleigh had been formed around the castle, including woodland, a fishpond, stables and a park lodge, but the castle was also associated with a wider estate including Rayleigh, Thundersley and Eastwood Parks.Creighton, p.191; Alexander and Westlake, p.29. The first castle built on the site was probably of an octagonal design, running along the top of the ridge, protected by square and semi-circular mural towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern entrance.Alexander and Westlake, p.9; Pounds, p.149. It probably resembled White Castle, remodelled by de Burgh in the same period, or Bolingbroke and Beeston Castles, both built in the 1220s.Alexander and Westlake, p.11; Pounds, p.150. The castle was built of Kentish ragstone and cemented by a mortar containing a large proportion of seashells, particularly cockleshells from the cockle beds of neighbouring Canvey Island.King, p.84. A valuable tidal watermill had been built by 1249, essential for making bread for the castle; recent archaeological work suggests that it was positioned on a wharf reaching out into the estuary just to the south-east of the castle.Alexander and Westlake, p.26. Terraced gardens were built along the south side of the castle overlooking the estuary, probably including vineyards.Alexander and Westlake, pp.56‚Äì7. De Burgh finally fell out of favour with Henry III; he was imprisoned and then finally stripped of Hadleigh Castle in 1239. For the rest of the century, Hadleigh was retained as a royal castle, as part of an estate containing of agricultural land, the park and the castle mill. By the 1250s, the castle had fallen into neglect and, despite some investment after it was given to Queen Eleanor in 1273, it remained in relatively poor condition. Only the mill, vital for the operation of the wider estate, appears to have been well-maintained. A new 17-metre-wide by 9-metre-long (56 foot by 30 foot) hall and an adjacent solar complex were built at the castle around 1290, but collapsed due to subsidence shortly afterwards. In 1299 the castle was given to Queen Margaret, who complained about the quality of the building and insisted that repairs were carried out. Her husband, Edward I, visited the castle twice, using it as a base for hunting in the area. ===14th century=== Plan of Hadleigh Castle in the late 14th century, based on the 1862 excavations: A ‚Äì barbican entrance; B ‚Äì royal apartments; C ‚Äì postern gate Edward II took a much closer interest in Hadleigh, leading to a period of renewal and rebuilding during his reign and that of his son, Edward III.Alexander and Westlake, p.13. Edward II first stayed there in 1311, and work was done to renovate the castle before he arrived, including building new royal quarters and repairing some of the castle walls that had succumbed to subsidence. Amongst the buildings known to be in the castle during the period were the castle hall, larder, kitchen, cellar, a long house, prison, an \\"old chamber\\" and armoury; they were guarded by a garrison of 24 soldiers during crises. Edward stayed there frequently during his reign up until 1324, on occasion travelling to Hadleigh Castle from London on his royal barge, which docked at a wharf to the south of the castle. Edward III acquired Hadleigh Castle in 1330, when he recovered it from his mother, Isabella of France, who had taken it from Edward when she deposed him in 1326.Alexander and Westlake, p.14. Edward paid little initial interest to the castle, but in the 1360s decided to make much greater use of the property, ordering large parts of it to be rebuilt at a cost of more than ¬£2200. Between 1361 and 1363 the internal buildings were renovated and new royal lodgings built along the south walls, after which the east side of the castle was rebuilt entirely, with two large circular towers installed in a new stretch of curtain wall, completed by 1365.Alexander and Westlake, pp.14‚Äì5. The north side of the castle was rebuilt to include a main entrance with a portcullis and a drawbridge, protected by a barbican and a large circular tower called the \\"High Tower\\", which was complete by 1370.Alexander and Westlake, p.15; Kenyon, pp.75, 82, 92. The work was probably overseen by William of Wykeham.Alexander and Westlake, p.15. Originally, historians believed that Edward's decision to rebuild much of the castle was in response to the growing tensions with France; in this version of events, Hadleigh would have formed an importance coastal fortification along the Thames estuary, protecting it from French raids.Alexander and Westlake, p.16. Current historical opinion plays down this motivation, noting that at the time of the work on Hadleigh relations with France were unusually good. Instead, it is suspected that the increasing elderly Edward intended Hadleigh more as a personal retreat close to London, where he could stay in privacy and considerable comfort.Alexander and Westlake, p.17. Whilst the entrance on the inland side remained relatively basic, the building work created a grander impression from the estuary ‚Äì any visitors to London, English or French, would have passed by Queenborough Castle on the south bank and Hadleigh on the north, the combination communicating a strong sense of royal power.Alexander and Westlake, p.17; Kenyon, p.82. ===15th‚Äì19th centuries=== The towers, royal lodgings and remaining walls as seen from the south in an engraving of 1783, after Francis Grose Edward III's grandson, Richard II, made little use of Hadleigh, and the use of the castle was granted to Aubrey de Vere until his death in 1400.Alexander and Westlake, p.18. The castle was passed amongst a number of high-status owners during the 15th century, but saw little use by the crown. Edmund of Langley and his son Edward of Norwich, the Dukes of York, used the castle in the early years, before passing it on to Humphrey of Lancaster, the Duke of Gloucester. Richard, Duke of York, used the castle next, before it passed to Edmund Tudor in the middle of the century. The tradition of the castle forming part of the queen's property was then reinstated and it was granted to Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. Henry VIII made no known use of the castle himself, but it formed part of the dower of three of his wives - Catherine of Aragon, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Parr - and the castle's parks were used as sources of timbers for his navy.Alexander and Westlake, p.19. After 1544 the estate began to be broken up; first the parks were sold and then the castle itself, bought by Lord Richard Rich from Edward VI for ¬£700 in 1551. Rich dismantled the castle for the value of its stone, primarily between 1551 and 1575, and the castle, now thoroughly ruined, passed through Rich's descendants.Alexander and Westlake, p.20. The English painter John Constable visited Hadleigh in 1814 and made a drawing of the castle as preparation for ten oil sketches and a single painting. The oil painting Hadleigh Castle was produced in 1829 and exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year. One of the sketches is currently displayed at the Tate Gallery, London, while the painting now hangs in the Yale Center for British Art at New Haven, United States.Constable's Sketch for Hadleigh Castle: A Technical Examination, Duff, Natasha, accessed 26 September 2012. Constable's painting, \\"one of his most monumental works\\" according to the art historians Tammis Groft and Mary Mackay, depicts the early 19th-century Hadleigh Castle as a decaying, man-made structure, succumbing to the elemental power of nature.Groft and Mackay, p.86. William Booth purchased Hadleigh Castle and its surrounding site in 1891 for the use of the Salvation Army, which established a farm to train the English poor prior to them being sent overseas to the British colonies. Considerable subsidence and slippage on the ridge occurred between 1898 and 1923, causing a collapse of the southern curtain wall.Alexander and Westlake, p.52. ===Today=== The Salvation Army gave the castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, and it is now owned by English Heritage, classed as a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002.Alexander and Westlake, pp.6, 52. One of the three-storey towers at the eastern side stands to nearly full height with narrow rectangular windows in the upper levels. The second tower has only about one-third of its original form. Some sections of the curtain wall have survived, as well as the foundations of the great hall, solars, and the kitchen.Bettley and Pevsner, p.438. The castle is still surrounded by the 19th-century Salvation Army farm, and beyond that by Hadleigh Country Park, owned and managed by Essex County Council and a Site of Special Scientific Interest with special regard for invertebrates.Welcome to Hadleigh Country Park, Hadleigh Country Park, accessed 27 April 2011. In 2008, Hadleigh Farm, close to the castle, was announced as the venue for the mountain biking competition in the 2012 Summer Olympics.Essex venue to host 2012 biking BBC Sport, accessed 27 April 2011. ==See also== * Castles in Great Britain and Ireland * List of castles in England ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Alexander, Magnus and Susan Westlake.

Most lobosans possess broad, bluntly rounded pseudopods, although one genus in the group, the recently discovered Sapocribrum, has slender and threadlike (filose) pseudopodia. In current classification schemes, Lobosa is a subphylum, composed mainly of amoebae that have lobose pseudopods but lack cilia or flagella. The group was originally proposed in 1861 by William B. Carpenter, who created it as a taxonomic order containing the single family Amoebina. Carpenter's Lobosa consisted of amoeboid organisms whose endoplasm (endosarc) flows into lobe-like \\"pseudopodian prolongations.\\" This type of pseudopod, which was understood to be typical of the genus Amoeba \\"and its allies,\\" differed from the filose (thread-like) or reticulose (netlike) pseudopods of the Foraminifera. The name Lobosa was chosen for these amoebae \\"as expressing the lobe-like character of their pseudopodial extensions\\". As currently defined, the subphylum Lobosa includes both shelled (testate) and naked amoebae (gymnamoebae), but excludes some organisms traditionally regarded as \\"lobosean\\", such as Pelomyxa and Entamoeba (Amoebozoa) and some Heterolobosea (Excavata).

He was the first Welshman to become Chairman of the Conservative Party, serving from 1970 to 1972, and the first Conservative to serve as Secretary of State for Wales, holding that office from 1970 to 1974. ==Early and family life== Thomas was born in Llanrwst, where his father was a solicitor. He was educated at the village school, and then Epworth College in Rhyl, before reading law at Jesus College, Oxford. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1939, on the outbreak of the Second World War. He was shot down while serving as a bomber pilot in 1941, and spent four years in prisoner-of-war camps in Germany, moving from Stalag Luft VI to Stalag Luft III and then at Stalag XI-B. He continued his legal studies while imprisoned, and was also an amateur actor. He became a barrister after the war, and was called to the Bar in 1947 at Middle Temple. He practised on the Wales and Chester circuit, and took silk in 1965. He became deputy chairman of Cheshire quarter sessions in 1966, and then of Denbighshire quarter sessions in 1968, serving in both offices until 1970. He was a Crown Court recorder from 1974 to 1988, and also sat as an arbitrator on the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. He was bilingual in Welsh and English, and took an active part in the Gorsedd, attending Eisteddfodau under the bardic name Pedr Conwy (Welsh: Peter from Conway). He married Tessa Dean in 1947. She was the daughter of actor and film and theatrical producer Basil Dean and his wife, Lady Mercy Greville. His wife died in 1985, and he outlived both of their two sons. He was survived by his two daughters upon his death in February 2008 at the age of 87. ==Political career== Thomas was elected to Parliament as MP for Conway in 1951, winning a narrow majority in the marginal seat over the Labour incumbent. He turned down the position of Under-Secretary of State for Wales at the Home Office to concentrate on his legal career, but later served as Parliamentary private secretary to Sir Harry Hylton-Foster (the Solicitor General and later Speaker) from 1954 to 1959. He was a member of the Council of Europe from 1957 to 1959, and sponsored the private members bill that became the Eisteddfod Act 1959. He served as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Labour 1959‚Äì61, taking charge of the measures that abolished the requirements for employees to be paid in cash and the maximum wage for professional footballer (¬£14 per week in November 1960). He moved to become Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office in 1961, travelling to Moscow with Lord Home in 1963 to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He was promoted to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in 1963, and was sworn of the Privy Council in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1964, but left office when his party lost the 1964 general election. In opposition, he was a spokesman on foreign affairs and then law from 1965‚Äì66. Although he had held his Conway seat (and steadily increased his majority) since 1951, he narrowly lost to Labour at the 1966 general election, but returned as MP for Hendon South at the general election in June 1970, a position which he held until retiring in 1987. During the whole of Edward Heath's premiership he held the position of Secretary of State for Wales. He was Secretary of State during a period of violent activism by proponents of the Welsh language, including bombings and a campaign by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) to remove English road signs. In February 1971, paralleling plans to reorganise local government in England, Thomas announced the plans to replace the existing 181 local councils with 7 new county councils counties and 36 district councils. An extra county council was added later, for Cardiff. Thomas also served as Chairman of the Conservative Party between 1970 and 1972. Thomas remained Welsh spokesman after the Conservative Party lost the general election in February 1974, but left the front bench when Margaret Thatcher became party leader in February 1975. He became active on backbench committees, and was president of the Conservative Friends of Israel. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1987 general election, and was raised to the peerage for life in the Dissolution Honours that year, gazetted as Baron Thomas of Gwydir, of Llanrwst in the County of Gwynedd. ==Arms== ==References== *Obituary, The Times, 7 February 2008 *Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 7 February 2008 *Obituary, The Guardian, 6 February 2008 *Obituary, The Independent, 7 February 2008 ==External links == * Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Thomas of Gwydir Category:Secretaries of State for Wales Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:British Queen's Counsel Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1951‚Äì1955 Category:UK MPs 1955‚Äì1959 Category:UK MPs 1959‚Äì1964 Category:UK MPs 1964‚Äì1966 Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:UK MPs 1979‚Äì1983 Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Chairmen of the Conservative Party (UK) Category:Ministers in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home governments, 1957‚Äì1964 ","title":"Peter Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir"},{"id":"1295629","text":"Majora (Majora - M√°rio J.

Cards are either dealt into separate piles around the table, one per player, or (particularly when played with young children) into a single shared pile. Gameplay is related to Egyptian Ratscrew. In China, Snap usually refers to the game Slapjack. ==The game== The pack of cards is dealt out among the players in face-down stacks as equally as possible. Play proceeds with the players taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of their stack and place it face-up on a pile alongside it. If two cards on the tops of any of these piles are ever identical (or, if a conventional pack of cards is used, are of the same number), the first player to shout \\"Snap!\\" takes both face-up piles and adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all the cards wins. A \\"snap pool\\" is created from matching stacks if two players shout \\"Snap!\\" at the exact same time, or from a player's own stack if they shout \\"Snap!\\" in error. Players can shout \\"Snap pool!\\" instead of \\"Snap!\\" if the matching cards also match the pool, and may take the pool for doing so. (If multiple players call \\"snap pool\\", the newly matching cards are also added to the pool.) ==Variations== Cards can be played onto a single shared stack, and players call \\"snap!\\" if two consecutive cards on this pile are identical. This makes the game easier for younger children. In this version, players may race to call \\"snap\\" while slapping the central pile, making the game similar to Slapjack. The game is often one of the first card games to be taught to children and is often played with special packs of cards featuring popular children's characters from television programmes or recent films. ==In popular culture== In J. K.

He was also regarded, particularly in later years, as a non- political figure of stature in Wales having held posts of importance in bodies such as the University of Wales. ==Early life== Cledwyn Hughes was born at 13 Plashyfryd Terrace, Holyhead, the elder son of Henry David Hughes and Emma Davies (n√©e Hughes), who was a young widow with a son, Emlyn, when she remarried in 1915. His father, widely known as Harri Hughes, had left school at the age of twelve to work in the Dinorwic quarry, as several generations of his family had done. Aged 21, he resumed his education and entered the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, serving as the minister of Disgwylfa Chapel in Holyhead from 1915 until his death in 1947. In turn his son regularly preached on Sundays in Anglesey's chapels, even when serving as a cabinet minister. David Hughes was a prominent local Liberal and a strong supporter of Lady Megan Lloyd George, who served as the Liberal MP for Anglesey from 1929. Hughes was educated at the Holyhead Grammar School and at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he studied Law and became president of the Liberal Society. After graduating in 1937, he returned to Holyhead, and was articled to a local solicitor. As local unemployment deepened, and the Czechoslovak crisis intensified, he listened to local Independent Labour Party speakers, and joined the Labour party in 1938. Hughes qualified as a solicitor in 1940. During the Second World War, Hughes served in the RAFVR in an administrative role, achieving the rank of Flight Lieutenant. ==Early political career== In 1944, local Labour activists urged him to stand in the post-war general election against Lady Megan Lloyd George, who had served as Liberal MP for the Anglesey constituency since 1929. Despite the resistance of his father, Hughes fought the 1945 election with very little organisational support. He made 50 speeches - 45 of them in Welsh, and came within 1,081 votes of victory. Following demobilisation in 1946, Hughes returned to Holyhead to practise as a solicitor and was appointed acting clerk to Holyhead District Council. In 1946, he became the youngest member of Anglesey County Council when he was elected to represent the Kingsland Ward in Holyhead. He remained a county councillor until 1953 and maintained good relations with the County Council throughout his time as a Member of Parliament, and had some success in bringing employment to the island. In 1950, he challenged Lady Megan again, but she beat him by 2,000 votes. This was partly because, although a Liberal, she had identified with Labour. In 1951 general election, however, when Labour lost ground nationally, he ousted her by 595 votes. ==Early parliamentary career== Tablet at the Brecon Beacons Mountain Centre with references to Cledwyn Hughes and Tudor Watkins In his maiden speech on 8 November 1951, Hughes addressed a number of issues that would recur during his parliamentary career, including the deficiencies of housing on Anglesey, the case for devolution in Wales, and his concerns about the future of the Welsh language. In his first term as MP for Anglesey, Hughes placed considerable emphasis on attracting new jobs to the island. He was acutely aware that a large proportion of the young people were obliged to leave Anglesey to look for work, and Hughes was active in the process of securing the Wylfa nuclear power station and later an aluminium smelter project to be located on the island. Such efforts contributed to an increase in his majority to 4,568 at the 1955 General Election. During his early parliamentary career, Hughes concentrated on Welsh issues. Together with a number of other Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, he supported the Parliament for Wales Campaign. In 1955, he seconded a bill proposed by S.O. Davies in favour of such a parliament but it was supported by only fourteen members of the Commons. A national petition was launched in 1956, which resulted in his being reported to the Labour national executive by the south-Wales-dominated Welsh Council of Labour. Following the failure of this campaign, Hughes supported efforts to secure a Secretary of State for Wales and this became Labour's official policy by the 1959 General Election. In 1957 he was appointed to the Public Accounts Committee. In the following year he conducted a month-long visit to St Helena on behalf of the Labour Party. Hughes was the first MP to visit the island since it was ceded to the British Government by the East India Company in 1843. Hughes submitted a highly critical report describing the \\"appalling poverty\\" of the island's inhabitants and assisted with the establishment of the island's first trade union. This visit established Hughes's reputation as a politician actively involved with the affairs of the Commonwealth. In 1959, Hugh Gaitskell appointed Hughes as a shadow spokesman on housing and local government. When Labour came to power in 1964, Hughes was appointed Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations and this turned out to be an inspired appointment which Harold Wilson considered to be \\"one of the Government's outstanding successes\\". During his two years in post Hughes was heavily involved with decolonization and represented the British Government at the independence celebrations of Malta, Kenya and the Gambia. His negotiating skills were tested by conflicts within the Commonwealth, notably in Cyprus, Malaysia and the Indian sub-continent where Hughes negotiated a cease-fire between India and Pakistan following a military conflict in the Rann of Kutch during June 1965. Hughes was also involved in the negotiations to avert a unilateral declaration of independence in Southern Rhodesia. In July 1965, he visited Salisbury for talks with Ian Smith, but these were unsuccessful and Smith declared UDI the following November. ==Secretary of State for Wales== In 1966, Wilson made him Secretary of State for Wales in succession to Jim Griffiths. Hughes was supported as Minister of State by George Thomas until 1967 and then by Eirene White who spoke warmly of his support and encouragement in that he allowed her to carry out her duties without undue interference. His first months at the Welsh Office were difficult despite the fact that Labour had won 32 of the 36 Welsh constituencies. On 14 July 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the Carmarthen by-election to become the first Plaid Cymru MP leading to an upsurge in support for political nationalism, which was also reflected in the Welsh Language Society's active campaign for bilingual road tax licences. Within the Labour Party a minority of Welsh MPs and activists supported some form of devolution reminiscent of the campaign which Hughes had supported in the 1950s. At the same time many of Hughes's Labour colleagues, particularly veteran MPs in the industrial south, were fiercely opposed to any form of devolution. Hughes ended up caught between these two wings, and disappointed those who had anticipated a greater move towards devolution. In 1968 Hughes was succeeded as Secretary of State by George Thomas, whose views on the subject were fundamentally opposed to those of his predecessor. Hughes's term of office was also deeply affected by the tragedy at Aberfan in October 1966, when a colliery spoil heap engulfed the primary school, leaving 144 dead, the vast majority of them children. Hughes immediately flew to the scene, and helped direct the rescue effort and ensure the well-being of survivors. An inquiry was set up under Lord Justice Edmund-Davies which, amongst its conclusions, stated that Lord Robens, the National Coal Board chairman, had misled Hughes in claiming that all tips were regularly inspected. Hughes described the Aberfan disaster as the darkest days of his life. He spent much of his time developing the nascent Welsh Office, creating a new civil service structure in Wales and seeking to build the economic base. This included the opening of the Anglesey Aluminium smelter at Holyhead in his constituency. In 1967, Hughes was successful in securing that the Royal Mint be located at Llantrisant in south Wales rather than in Scotland or Durham, as argued by his cabinet colleagues William Ross and Anthony Greenwood respectively. The episode was regarded as enhancing the stature of the relatively new Welsh Office, as well as strengthening Hughes's position in the Cabinet. ==Minister for Agriculture== In 1968 Wilson moved Hughes to become Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Hughes was disappointed to leave the Welsh Office, not least because he had done much preparatory work for the investiture of the Prince of Wales scheduled for 1969. This included sending a monthly letter on Welsh affairs to the Prince, then at Cambridge. At Agriculture, Hughes replaced Fred Peart, who was strongly opposed to the Common Market. In contrast, Hughes was a supporter, and a great admirer of Roy Jenkins. Despite an early gaffe when he told Danish bacon producers that their product was \\"the choice of the British housewife\\", Hughes fared better than most Labour incumbents in this post, and set out to boost home food production with incentives for producers of cereals and red meat. He also dealt effectively with the consequences of a severe outbreak of foot and mouth disease by ensuring that the recommendations of an enquiry chaired by the Duke of Northumberland were implemented. This action prevented another major occurrence of the disease for many years. During his time as Secretary of State for Wales, Hughes had favoured extending the nascent department's powers over agriculture and health; as Minister of Agriculture, he transferred powers over agriculture in Wales to the Welsh Office. ==Later Commons career== The 1970 General Election in Anglesey was a difficult one for Hughes, who was heavily criticized by Plaid Cymru supporters. At the count there were unpleasant scenes. Following Labour's defeat, Hughes was not elected to the Shadow Cabinet but kept the Agriculture portfolio. However, in 1972 he was dismissed by Wilson for voting in favour of entry into the Common Market. He remained a strong pro-European and was a vice-president of the umbrella group Britain in Europe during the 1975 referendum. On return to office in 1974, Hughes was disappointed not to be offered a ministerial post. However he successfully challenged Ian Mikardo for the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and held the post throughout the parliament. His ability to nudge people into loyalty were in great demand in view of the Government's small majority. In 1976, Wilson resigned suddenly and Hughes was tasked as chairman of the PLP with organizing the election of a successor. Hughes was close politically not only to Roy Jenkins but also to James Callaghan who he had first met in 1949 at the home of Glenys Kinnock's parents in Holyhead. Upon his election, James Callaghan recommended the appointment of Hughes as a Companion of Honour. In March 1977, Hughes was actively involved in the negotiations that led to the Lib-Lab pact. In the autumn of the following year, when the Callaghan government did not have a majority in the Commons, Hughes persuaded the three Plaid Cymru members to support the government in return for a commitment to legislate for compensation to workers suffering from silicosis as a result of working in the slate quarrying industry. In late 1978 he was once again despatched as an envoy to Rhodesia, seeking to accelerate the handover of power to the majority population, but as in 1965, he made little headway in persuading Ian Smith to co-operate. Hughes also failed to persuade Joshua Nkomo to give up the armed struggle. In 1979 was hugely disappointed by the decisive referendum vote against devolution for Wales held on 1 March 1979. He did eventually participate in the 1997 campaign that led to a narrow vote in favour. Weeks later, he stood down from his Anglesey seat and was succeeded as Labour candidate by his close ally, Elystan Morgan. However, the seat was surprisingly lost to the Conservative candidate Keith Best with a substantial swing. The result underlined the extent to which Hughes had built up a personal vote during his 29 years as MP for the constituency. Labour did not recapture the seat until 2001. ==House of Lords== On 16 July 1979 he was made a life peer as Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos, of Holyhead in the Isle of Anglesey. After the death of Lord Goronwy-Roberts in July 1981, Cledwyn became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords. In November 1982 he challenged Fred Peart for the role of Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords, following dissatisfaction among leading Labour peers towards Peart's leadership. For the next decade he proved highly skilled in organizing the resources at his disposal to keep the government under scrutiny. There were only around 120 Labour peers, and a third of them were too unwell or elderly to regularly participate in debates. During this time the debates in the Lords were televised (at a time when those in the Commons were not) and this gave significant prominence to the Labour opposition in the Lords. For most of his decade as Labour leader and, as such, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Neil Kinnock was the leader of the Labour Party and they formed a strong working relationship. Had Labour won the 1992 General Election, Kinnock would have appointed Lord Cledwyn to a Cabinet post. Labour's defeat was a great disappointment to him, as he was unable to implement his proposals to reform the institution. The leadership passed to another Welshman, Lord Richard of Ammanford. ==Later life== During his later years, Lord Cledwyn took on a number of roles in Welsh public life. From 1976 until 1985 he was President of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He has a building named after him at Aberystwyth, which is home to the School of Business and Management. He relinquished this post in 1985 on being appointed Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales. Over the next decade he devoted much of his time to the University's various problems, including financial challenges. In particular, he was successful in obtaining funding from the Conservative government to allow the merger of the University College at Cardiff with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology to form what became Cardiff University. In 1995 he became President of the University College of North Wales, Bangor. Another of his great interests was his involvement in campaigns for recognition of the Welsh language. Most notably, in 1980, he played a leading part in persuading William Whitelaw to change government policy and to establish a Welsh language television service. He was thus instrumental in persuading Gwynfor Evans to abandon his intention to begin a hunger strike. The new channel was launched as S4C in 1982. Most of his contributions in the House of Lords during the last decade of his life were on Welsh subjects. ==Family== In 1949 he married Jean Beatrice, daughter of Captain Jesse Hughes, of Holyhead.Dod's Parliamentary Companion, Vacher Dodd Publishing, Ltd, 2000, p. 462 She shared both his religion and politics. Cledwyn and Jean Hughes had two children, a daughter, Ann and son, Harri. From 1955 until 1959 the family lived in London, but in 1959 decided that they move back to Anglesey where the children could be brought up in a Welsh speaking community. Lord Cledwyn died, aged 84, at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan on 22 February 2001. Following a public funeral service at Disgwylfa Chapel on 27 February, he was buried at Maeshyfryd Cemetery, Holyhead. ==Tributes and assessment== On learning of his death, former Prime Minister James Callaghan said that Cledwyn Hughes 'was an unfailing counsellor to me throughout my political life, and especially during my time as prime minister. Wales has lost a great man, and I mourn a true friend.' Cledwyn Hughes was regarded primarily as an efficient administrator, but also as a person of great warmth and humour, with a considerable talent for storytelling. During the 1960s and 1970s his florid complexion was a familiar sight in the news. In Wales and beyond, he was known simply as Cledwyn. ==References== ==Sources== ===Books and journals=== * * ===Online=== * * * ===Hansard (Parliamentary debates)=== * * ===Other=== * Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1979 == External links == * Category:1916 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Agriculture ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Alumni of Aberystwyth University Category:Bards of the Gorsedd Category:Councillors in Wales Cledwyn of Penrhos Category:Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964‚Äì1970 Category:People associated with the University of Wales Category:People educated at Holyhead High School Category:People from Anglesey Category:Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II Category:Secretaries of State for Wales Category:UK MPs 1951‚Äì1955 Category:UK MPs 1955‚Äì1959 Category:UK MPs 1959‚Äì1964 Category:UK MPs 1964‚Äì1966 Category:UK MPs 1966‚Äì1970 Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:Welsh Labour Party MPs ","title":"Cledwyn Hughes, Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos"},{"id":"1295652","text":"Hermann Schultz (December 30, 1836 - May 15, 1903), German Protestant theologian, was born at L√ºchow in Hanover (now in Lower Saxony). ==Education== He studied at G√∂ttingen and Erlangen, became professor at Basel in 1864, and eventually (1876) professor ordinarius at G√∂ttingen.

The film was written and directed by David Steiman, a former assistant to Brett Ratner; Ratner served as a producer. ==Plot== On Christmas Eve, the Mason family (played by a cast of all Jewish celebrities in bit roles) is bickering about their wealth and material possessions while eating Christmas dinner when Santa Claus (Bill Goldberg, coincidentally also Jewish) comes down the chimney and kills them all in various graphic displays of Christmas-themed violence, such as drowning the matriarch Virginia (Fran Drescher) in eggnog, using the star atop a Christmas tree as a ninja star and stabbing the patriarch's hands to the table with silverware and suffocating him by stuffing a leg of turkey in his mouth. Riding on his sleigh driven by his \\"hell-deer\\" the Buffalo-like Beast, Santa arrives at Hell Township and decimates the locals in various holiday-themed ways. In one of his kills, Santa slaughters the occupants of a local strip club, frequented by Pastor Timmons (Dave Thomas), a crooked minister, who manages to survive the massacre. Later, Santa murders the local Jewish delicatessen owner Mr. Green, (Saul Rubinek), using his own menorah. Meanwhile, teenager Nicholas Yuleson (Douglas Smith) is living with his crazy grandfather (Robert Culp), a crackpot inventor who has built a bunker in their basement to survive Christmas. When Nicholas asks Grandpa why he hates Christmas, he is shown \\"The Book of Klaus\\", which reveals the origins of Santa Claus. Apparently, Santa was the result of a virgin birth produced by Satan (just as Jesus was the result of a virgin birth produced by God‚Äîmeaning that Santa is somewhat of an Antichrist). Christmas was \\"The Day of Slaying\\" for Santa until A.D. 1005, when an angel defeated him in a curling match and sentenced him to deliver presents on Christmas for 1,000 years. This means that Santa is free to kill again in 2005. Upon arriving at the delicatessen, Nicholas is taken to the police station for questioning about Mr. Green's murder. He is bailed out by his girlfriend, Mary \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie (Emilie de Ravin), just before Santa arrives and kills all of the officers. Santa pursues Nicholas and Mac in a police car, but they are able to escape, thanks to a shotgun left in Mac's truck by her gun-crazed father (Jeff Hanna). They flee to Mr. Yuleson's bunker, with Santa still in pursuit. Nicholas and Mac manage to escape using Grandpa's snowmobile; but Grandpa is run over by Santa's \\"hell-deer\\" and killed. The two teens hide in a local high school, hoping that Santa's powers will end once Christmas ends; but they are eventually forced to confront him in the gym. They are almost killed by Santa on a Zamboni but are saved by Grandpa, who is actually the angel who originally defeated and sentenced Santa. With Christmas over and his powers gone, Santa flees in his sleigh; but his \\"hell-deer\\" are shot down by Mac's father with a bazooka. Pastor Timmons is found dead in a Santa suit and is presumed to be the killer, while, in fact, the real killer Santa Claus is boarding a flight from Winnipeg to the North Pole. After the credits, Santa is seen looking over his Naughty List, when he looks into the camera and says \\"Who's Next?\\" ==Cast== *Douglas Smith as Nicholas Yuleson * Bill Goldberg as Santa Claus * Emilie de Ravin as Mary McKenzie * Robert Culp as Grandpa * Dave Thomas as Pastor Timmons * Saul Rubinek as Mr. Green * James Caan as Darren Mason (uncredited) * Rebecca Gayheart as Gwen Mason * Chris Kattan as Jason Mason * Fran Drescher as Virginia Mason * Alicia Loren as Beth Mason * Annie Sorell as Taylor Mason * Donna Zuk as Mrs. Talbot * Tom 'Tiny' Lister as a gas station attendant * Scott Francis Gibson as the S.W.N.D.S.U. place kicker * Jimmy Herman as Vinny * Michael David Simms as Captain/Officer Caulk * Donald Bland as a bouncer * Kevin Gillese as a disgruntled youth * Ronnie as Santa‚Äôs Helldeer * Apache as Santa‚Äôs Helldeer * Joan Dunham as a random grandmother * Kendall Garwryluk as a random father ==Release== Santa's Slay was released on DVD in the United States by Lionsgate on December 20, 2005.

The film was not without its detractors. Jon Condit from Dread Central was highly critical of the film, awarding it 1.5 out of 5 stars. In his review, Condit criticized the film's writing and direction as being \\"sloppy\\" and \\"amateurish\\", also criticizing the abrupt ending. ==References* Category:2005 comedy horror films Category:2000s Christmas films Category:2005 films Category:2005 horror films Category:American black comedy films Category:American Christmas films Category:American films Category:American slasher films Category:Canadian Christmas films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian slasher films Category:Christmas horror films Category:Films set in 2005 Category:Films shot in Edmonton Category:Lionsgate films Category:Santa Claus in film Category:Demons in film Category:2005 comedy films ","title":"Santa's Slay"},{"id":"1295711","text":"Hegemonic stability theory (HST) is a theory of international relations, rooted in research from the fields of political science, economics, and history. HST indicates that the international system is more likely to remain stable when a single nation-state is the dominant world power, or hegemon.Joshua S. Goldstein. International Relations. New York: Pearson- Longman, 2005. 107. Thus, the fall of an existing hegemon or the state of no hegemon diminishes the stability of the international system. When a hegemon exercises leadership, either through diplomacy, coercion, or persuasion, it is actually deploying its \\"preponderance of power.\\" This is called hegemony, which refers to a state's ability to \\"single-handedly dominate the rules and arrangements ...[of] international political and economic relations.\\"Joshua S. Goldstein. International Relations. New York: Pearson-Longman, 2005. 83. HST can help analyze the rise of great powers to the role of world leader or hegemon. Also, it can be used to understand and to calculate the future of international politics through the discussion of the symbiotic relation between the declining hegemon and its rising successor. Research on hegemony can be divided into two schools of thought: the realist school and the systemic school. Each school can be further sub-divided. Two dominant theories have emerged from each school. What Robert Keohane first called the \\"theory of hegemonic stability,\\"Robert Gilpin. The Political Economy of International Relations. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987. 86. joins A. F. K. Organski's Power Transition Theory as the two dominant approaches to the realist school of thought. Long Cycle Theory, espoused by George Modelski, and World Systems Theory, espoused by Immanuel Wallerstein, have emerged as the two dominant approaches to the systemic school of thought.Terry Boswell and Mike Sweat. \\"Hegemony, Long Waves, and Major Wars: A Time Series Analysis of Systemic Dynamics, 1496-1967,\\" International Studies Quarterly (1991) 35, 124. Charles P. Kindleberger is one of the scholars most closely associated with HST, and is regarded by some as the theory's father.Helen Milner. \\"International Political Economy: Beyond Hegemonic Stability,\\" Foreign Policy, (1998) In the 1973 book The World in Depression: 1929-1939, he argued that the economic chaos between World War I and World War II that led to the Great Depression was partly attributable to the lack of a world leader with a dominant economy. Kindleberger's reasoning touched upon more than economics, however: the central idea behind HST is that the stability of the global system, in terms of politics, international law, and so on, relies on the hegemon to develop and enforce the rules of the system.Vincent Ferraro. \\"The Theory of Hegemonic Stability.\\" http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/hegemony.htm In addition to Kindleberger, key figures in the development of hegemonic stability theory include Robert Gilpin, Joanne Gowa, Robert Keohane, Stephen Krasner, George Modelski and others.Michael C. Webb and Stephen D. Krasner. \\"Hegemonic Stability Theory: An Empirical Assessment\\", Review of International Studies (1989) 15, 183‚Äì98Barry Eichengreen, \\"Hegemonic Stability Theory and Economic Analysis: Reflections on Financial Instability and the Need for an International Lender of Last Resort\\" (December 9, 1996). Center for International and Development Economics Research. Paper C96-080. == Hegemonic rise == In order for a nation-state to rise to the level of hegemon, there are some attributes it must or is more advantageous to have. First of all, it must have political strength, military force, and superior national power that is necessary for its ability to forge new international laws and organizations. In terms of military force, a standing defensive army is not enough. A superior navy, or air force is. This explains why many hegemons have been geographically situated on peninsulas or islands. Peninsularity and insularity provide added security, and, where naval power is necessary, the ability to project military forces. In some cases, hegemons have not been insular or peninsular. The United States of America, for instance, has become a virtual island. It has two massive seaboards, and its neighbors are strong allies, and relatively reliable. Also, the modern invention of nuclear weapons, and the presence of a superior air force provide highly reliable security for the country, setting it apart from the rest of the world. Secondly, a hegemon must have a large and growing economy. Usually, unrivaled supremacy in at least one leading economic or technological sector is necessary. The first and second refers to a state having the attribute of the capability to enforce the rules of the system. Thirdly, a hegemon must have will to lead, and the will to establish a hegemonic regime, as well as the capability to lead and enforce the rules of the system. After World War I, Great Britain possessed the will to lead, but lacked the necessary abilities to do so. Without the ability to force stability on the international system, Great Britain was able to do little to prevent the onset of the Great Depression or World War II. Finally, a hegemon must commit to the system, which needs to be perceived as mutually beneficial for other great powers and important state-actors. == Competing theories of hegemonic stability == Hegemony is an important aspect of international relations. Various schools of thought and theories have emerged in an attempt to better understand hegemonic actors and their influence. === The systemic school of thought === According to Thomas J. McCormick, scholars and other experts on the systemic school define hegemony \\"as a single power's possession of 'simultaneous superior economic efficiency in production, trade and finance.'\\" Furthermore, a hegemon's superior position is considered the logical consequence of superior geography, technological innovation, ideology, superior resources, and other factors.Thomas J. McCormick. \\"World Systems,\\" Journal of American History (June, 1990) 77, 128. ==== Long cycle theory ==== George Modelski, who presented his ideas in the book, Long Cycles in World Politics (1987), is the chief architect of long cycle theory. In a nutshell, long cycle theory describes the connection between war cycles, economic supremacy, and the political aspects of world leadership. Long cycles, or long waves, offer interesting perspectives on global politics by permitting \\"the careful exploration of the ways in which world wars have recurred, and lead states such as Britain and the United States have succeeded each other in an orderly manner.\\" Not to be confused with Simon Kuznets' idea of long-cycles, or long-swings, long cycles of global politics are patterns of past world politics.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987. The long cycle, according to Dr. Dan Cox, is a period of time lasting approximately 70 to 100 years. At the end of that period, \\"the title of most powerful nation in the world switches hands.\\".Jimmy Myers. \\"Missouri Western Faculty Discuss Iraq War.\\" St. Joseph News-Press. 2 Mar 2007. Modelski divides the long cycle into four phases. When periods of global war, which could last as much as one-fourth of the total long cycle, are factored in, the cycle can last from 87 to 122 years.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987, 102 Many traditional theories of international relations, including the other approaches to hegemony, believe that the baseline nature of the international system is anarchy.Mark Rupert. \\"Hegemonic Stability Theory. Modelski's long cycle theory, however, states that war and other destabilizing events are a natural product of the long cycle and larger global system cycle. They are part of the living processes of the global polity and social order. Wars are \\"systemic decisions\\" that \\"punctuate the movement of the system at regular intervals.\\" Because \\"world politics is not a random process of hit or miss, win or lose, depending on the luck of the draw or the brute strength of the contestants,\\" anarchy simply doesn't play a role. After all, long cycles have provided, for the last five centuries, a means for the successive selection and operation of numerous world leaders.George Modelski. Long Cycles in World Politics. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1987, 100, 135 and 227. Modeslki used to believe that long cycles were a product of the modern period. He suggests that the five long cycles, which have taken place since about 1500, are each a part of a larger global system cycle, or the modern world system. Under the terms of long cycle theory, five hegemonic long cycles have taken place, each strongly correlating to economic Kondratieff Waves (or K-Waves). The first hegemon would have been Portugal during the 16th century, then the Netherlands during the 17th century. Next, Great Britain served twice, first during the 18th century, then during the 19th century. The United States has been serving as hegemon since the end of World War II. The traditional view of long cycle theory has evolved somewhat, as Modelski now suggests that Northern and Southern Sung China, Venice and Genoa were each the dominant economic powers during medieval long cycles. However, he does not classify any of these states as world powers. Only when Portugal gained hegemony after 1500 is that distinction made.George Modelski. Evolution of the World Economy. https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/Evoweconomy.html . === Other views of hegemonic stability === ==== The neorealist interpretation ==== Neorealists have been focusing on this theory recently, the main proponent of it being John J. Mearsheimer who is trying to incorporate it into 'offensive realism'.2001:4 In his book 'The Tragedy of Great Power Politics' Mearsheimer outlines how the anarchic system that neorealists subscribe to (see Kenneth Waltz for original theory) creates power hungry states who will each attempt to install themselves as regional and global hegemons.Mearsheimer, John, J. 'The Tragedy of Great Power Politics' W. W. Norton & Company, NYC 2001:1-366 His theory is not widely embraced by fellow realists who argue that the hegemon supports the system so long as it is in their interests. The system is created, shaped and maintained by coercion. The hegemon would begin to undermine the institution when it is not in their interests. With the decline of a hegemon, the system descends into instability. Other realists argue that the anarchic system does not actually give causal motivation to aid the creation of hegemons. ==== The neoliberal interpretation ==== Neoliberals argue that the hegemon wishes to maintain its dominant position without paying enforcement costs, so it creates a system in which it can credibly limit the returns to power (loser doesn't lose all) and credibly commit to neither dominate nor abandon them. This is done through institutions, which are sticky, (hard to change, more convenient to continue using than to revamp.) These institutions favor the hegemon, but provide protection and a stable world order for the rest of the world. The more open this world-order, the less likely that there will be a challenger.Ikenberry 1999. Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Persistence of American Postwar Order. With the decline of the hegemon, institutions don't automatically die, because they were constructed in a way that benefited all stakeholders; instead, they take on a life of their own (see regime theory).Keohane, After Hegemony, 1984Koremenos, Lipson & Snidal ==== The classical liberal interpretation ==== It is motivated by 'enlightened self-interest'; the hegemon takes on the costs because it is good for all actors, thereby creating stability in the system, which is also in the interests of all actors. ==== Criticism ==== Duncan Snidal argues that 'the range of the theory is very limited to very special conditions,' and suggests that the decline of a hegemonic power may demonstrate the possibility of a collective power. According to Snidal, the applicability of the theory can be challenged due to limitations and the theory only holds true empirically under special conditions.Snidal, D. (1985). The limits of hegemonic stability theory. International Organization, 39, pp 579-614. == 21st century application == === United States === Hegemony demands power, which is defined by British scholar Susan Strange as the ability of one party to affect outcomes such that their preferences take precedence over the preferences of other parties. The question of whether the United States is still a hegemon is tied into whether or not it has lost power. Keohane sees power as tied into resources and production. The US GDP is now lower relative to others as there are growing economies with considerable amount of GDP such as BRIC countries. This implies a loss or decreased power of US as a hegemon. Although resources are an important determinant of power, they are not always determinative. For example, the German troops that conquered western Europe were actually fewer in number than their opponents. Susan Strange uses this logic to argue that the United States is still a hegemon. The United States unilaterally helped Mexico in the Peso Crisis and unilaterally helped Russia with economic aid. The United States has also been influential in moving many countries towards embracing the free market; through institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the United States has pushed Latin American nations to undertake economic programs in accordance with its own foreign policy Interests (see Washington Consensus). === China === The United States is still considered by most analysts to be at the top of the world, both economically and in terms of military strength. With these abundant resources and power in the hands of the United States, they still remain as the leader \\"in a single superpower world\\". However, the emergence of new giants threatens U.S. hegemony by creating new power centers all over the world. Of those new giants, the single greatest competitor of United States is China as they are growing rapidly with \\"no equal in modern history\\". Historically, examples of hegemonic decline come in two prime sectors: the leading state's military, and its economy. Thus, it is important to look at China's emergence in both arenas and more to understand the shifting power structure. ====China's economic growth==== With the second highest gross domestic product at purchasing power parity, China poses a significant challenge to U.S. economic primacy especially with the expectation that U.S. national debt could explode to 717% of GDP by 2080 according to Congressional Budget office. Moreover, this debt is financed largely by China through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds. On the other hand, China's economic power, not limited to but including industrialization and modernization, is rapidly burgeoning with high consumption and increasing foreign investment. As Global Trends 2025 points out, the rise of China and India to great power status will restore each to \\"the positions they held two centuries ago when China produced approximately 30 percent and India 15 percent of the world's wealth\\" (p. 7). ====China's military expansion==== U.S. military can be characterized by \\"imperial overstretch\\" with troops operating abroad in more than fifty-five countries. Through this process, \\"a military force is extended so much that it nears a breaking point.\\" On the other hand, China is taking advantage by industrializing its army using their wealth. China's military budget is increasing and the troops are expanding. Steven W. Mosher insists that China is building up its armed forces \\"to break America's back in Asia and thus end America's reign as the sole superpower in the world.\\" However, many argue that China has a symbiotic relationship with the United States. If the United States declines, it is likely that China also may be in jeopardy. John Gulick points out that China's prosperity is \\"deeply ensconced in the 'China produces and lends, the US borrows and spends' framework\\". Economic interdependence of China derives from the fact that they are a producing state rather than a consuming state. China's economy is export heavy as its driving force lies in \\"export processing measures\\". The export dependent structure could severely dampen economic growth if demand for Chinese exports is reduced by another economic crisis in the United States. Thus, China's economic woes are one of the barriers to its hegemonic aspirations. However, it is not the only barrier that China must overcome to achieve from hegemony. In fact, HST demonstrates that their needs theoretical requirements for world leadership that China should strive to achieve in order to gain hegemonic status that include whether China has the will to lead and the ability to lead. Also, other factors- for example, domestic political instability, environmental degradation, public health issues, and demographic trends- could possibly hinder China's ascent to great power status. == Gilpin's argument == Gilpin's argument opposes balancing and the balance of power theory. His theory targets the system by analysis. He contends that the system naturally goes toward equilibrium. To acquire a new system, global war or \\"hegemonic war\\", definitionally creates a new hegemon. This new hegemon will create the new system of the world with their own set of preferences. Similar to a global war, the hegemon's job is to keep their newly founded order. They accomplish this by providing public goods; examples include the United States attempts at initialising a stable currency by means of the International Monetary Fund, the Bretton Woods system, establishment of the World Bank, world defence (NATO), and democratisation. These are norms that the U.S. have shown preference towards and have spent the past several decades demonstrating their new system. Gilpin argues further that by the global system, the more decisive a victory is after the \\"hegemonic war\\", the more stable the new system will be. He agrees with Paul Kennedy's claim of \\"imperialistic overstretch\\" being one of the reasons that hegemons fall. Gilpin adds that all hegemons inevitably fall because it is difficult to stay as hegemon. To exemplify this concept, if one were to walk into a weight room with robust men at their prime on one side of the room facing men who are working to reach the equivalent of the robust men, they will see that the working men grow muscle much faster than the already robust men. This is because they have more room to grow. It is harder for hegemons to \\"grow\\" when they have already grown and expanded so much. To ensure their preferences, the U.S. as the newest and current hegemon has created institutions for the system to represent their power structure. Eventually, Gilpin contends, a dissatisfied great power that approaches the power distribution, approaches the equivalence of the current hegemon will cause a new global war and the cycle repeats. Generally, the rising challenger does not go on to become the new hegemon as most of their resources have been depleted fighting the hegemon and do not have more to spare to instil their preferences. Instead, some theorists think, a state similar in culture and preferences to the old hegemon will assume new hegemon status. == References == ==See also== * Power transition theory * Realism (international relations) ===External links=== * Summaries of International Relations Theories Category:International relations theory Category:Political realism Category:Hegemony ","title":"Hegemonic stability theory"},{"id":"1295714","text":"Henery Hawk is a cartoon character from the American Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series, who appeared in thirteen cartoons. His first appearance was The Squawkin' Hawk, directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Leon Schlesinger. Henery's second appearance was Walky Talky Hawky which also featured Foghorn Leghorn and The Barnyard Dawg, directed by Robert McKimson. The last Warner Brothers short to feature Henery was Strangled Eggs. He appeared most recently on The Looney Tunes Show and Looney Tunes Cartoons. ==Character biography== Henery is a small, brown chickenhawk with a forelock of feathers. The young bird lives at home with his parents, and speaks with tough-guy bravado, but shows surprising strength to pull or deadlift prey more than three times his size. He was played in the first short by Kent Rogers. Rogers died in 1944, so the role was then taken over by Mel Blanc (and later by Joe Alaskey). Henery has a high-pitched voice with a New York accent and perpetually angry temperament. (With these characteristics, he became the later inspiration for the Hanna-Barbera character Scrappy-Doo.) In a typical Foghorn/Henery cartoon, Henery strikes out on his own for the first time, eager to capture (and presumably consume) a chicken. Having led a sheltered life, however, he does not know what a chicken looks like, only that chicken hawks eat them. Foghorn presumes that this diminutive, na√Øve troublemaker is no real threat; however, seeing the potential for annoyance, he points and manipulates Henery in the direction of Barnyard Dawg. The remainder of the cartoon is usually consumed by Dawg and Leghorn alternately assuring Henery that the other is a chicken and encouraging him to attack the \\"chicken\\" mercilessly. In a reversal, the cartoon The Foghorn Leghorn has Foghorn wanting Henery to believe Foghorn is a chicken, where Henery believes Foghorn is merely a \\"loud-mouthed shnook,\\" supposedly a separate kind of creature. Later, when Barnyard Dawg calls Foghorn a \\"good-for-nothing chicken\\", Henery finally wises up. Many cartoons ended with Henery capturing one (or both) of his tormentors, pragmatically shrugging his shoulders over whether his prey may or may not be an actual fowl. Typically, Henery would decide that one of them must be a real chicken; therefore, he would knock out and capture both, after threatening them with the catch-phrase \\"Are you comin' quietly, or do I have to muss ya up!?\\" Henery Hawk is also a supporting character in the Looney Tunes comic books; in pre-1970s stories, he often starred in features of his own, typically played against Oliver Owl as well as Foghorn. Henery was going to have a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but was later dropped for unknown reasons. Henery Hawk made a brief cameo appearance in the bleacher scenes of the 1996 film, Space Jam. In the 2010s series The Looney Tunes Show, Henery Hawk appeared in the episode \\"Fish and Visitors\\", in the Merrie Melodies segment \\"Chickenhawk\\" (sung by Barnyard Dawg) where he tries to eat Foghorn Leghorn while Foghorn tries to break him of his craving. In \\"Father Figure,\\" Porky Pig becomes the father figure of Henery Hawk who wants Porky to get him chicken. In 2011, Henery Hawk appeared in a commercial for GEICO along with Foghorn Leghorn. In the commercial, Foghorn was serving as a reader for a \\"book on tape\\" version of the Charles Dickens novel A Tale of Two Cities when Henery‚Äîsick and tired of Foghorn's ad-libbing‚Äîtakes a club and hits Foghorn with it off-camera. ==Cartoons== ===Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies=== #The Squawkin' Hawk (debut) (August 8, 1942) (directed by Chuck Jones) #Flop Goes the Weasel (as a black baby chicken) (March 20, 1943) (directed by Jones) #Walky Talky Hawky (August 31, 1946) (directed by Robert McKimson) #Crowing Pains (July 12, 1947) (directed by McKimson) #You Were Never Duckier (August 7, 1948) (directed by Jones) #The Foghorn Leghorn (October 9, 1948) (directed by McKimson) #Henhouse Henery (July 2, 1949) (directed by McKimson) #The Scarlet Pumpernickel (cameo) (March 4, 1950) (directed by Jones) #The Leghorn Blows at Midnight (May 6, 1950) (directed by McKimson) #Leghorn Swoggled (July 28, 1951) (directed by McKimson) #The Egg-Cited Rooster (October 4, 1952) (directed by McKimson) #All Fowled Up (February 19, 1955) (directed by McKimson) #Strangled Eggs (March 18, 1961) (directed by McKimson) ===Video games=== * The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout * Space Jam ==References== ==External links== *Henery Hawk at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Speculative reconstruction made in 1898 of the map sent by Toscanelli to Fernand Martins. Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397 ‚Äì 10 May 1482) was an Italian astrologer,, pp. 333‚Äì335 mathematician, and cosmographer. == Life == Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli was born in Florence, the son of the physician Domenico Toscanelli. There is no precise information on his education and background. Gustavo Uzielli claimed in 1894 that Toscanelli studied at the University of Padua, but modern authors consider this pure conjecture. Toscanelli is noted for his observations of comets. Among these was the comet of 1456, which was to be named Halley‚Äôs Comet after Edmond Halley predicted its return in 1759. Thanks to his long life, his intelligence and his wide interests, Toscanelli was one of the central figures in the intellectual and cultural history of Renaissance Florence in its early years. His circle of friends included Filippo Brunelleschi, the architect of the Florence Cathedral, and the philosopher Marsilio Ficino. He knew the mathematician, writer and architect Leon Battista Alberti, and his closest friend was Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa‚Äîhimself a wide-ranging intellect and early humanist, who dedicated two short mathematical works in 1445 to Toscanelli, and made himself and Toscanelli the interlocutors in a 1458 dialogue titled On Squaring the Circle (De quadratura circuli). Toscanelli along with Nicholas of Cusa appears to have belonged to a network of Florentine and Roman intellectuals who searched for and studied Greek mathematical works, along with Filelfo, George of Trebizond, and the humanist Pope Nicholas V, in company with Alberti and Brunelleschi. Around 1468 Toscanelli devised the gnomon still to be seen in the Florence Cathedral. A bronze plate let into the dome high above the left transept, and a circular white marble slab let into the floor of the cathedral, which records the summer solstice to a half-second. This was then and subsequently used for centuries for other calculations such as the regular movement of the Sun, effectively a camera obscura. In 1439, the Greek philosopher Gemistos Plethon, attending the Council of Florence, acquainted Toscanelli with the extensive travels, writings and mapping of the 1st century BC/AD Greek geographer Strabo, hitherto unknown in Italy. Nearly 35 years later, the Italian was to follow up this amplified knowledge. A modern version of Toscanelli's map. The Americas' landmasses are depicted in gray. In 1474, Toscanelli sent a letter and a map to his Portuguese correspondent Fern√£o Martins, priest at the Lisbon Cathedral, detailing a scheme for sailing westwards to reach the Spice Islands and Asia. Fern√£o Martins delivered his letter to the King Afonso V of Portugal, in his court of Lisbon. The original of this letter was lost, but its existence is known through Toscanelli himself, who later transcribed it along with the map and sent it to Christopher Columbus, who carried them with him during his first voyage to the New World.\\"Point of View\\" Day the Universe Changed Toscanelli had miscalculated Asia as being 5,000 miles longer than it really was, and Columbus miscalculated the circumference of the Earth by 25 percent: both of which resulted in Columbus not realizing initially he had found a new continent. Toscanelli lived most of his life in Florence, with occasional excursions to Todi and Rome. He is said to have entered into correspondence with scholars around Europe, but his writings have yet to be thoroughly researched. An uncorroborated story links Toscanelli‚Äôs attendance at a Chinese delegation to the Pope in 1432, when many Chinese inventions were discussed, with a flood of drawings made around the same year by the artist-engineer Taccola (1382 ‚Äì c.1453), which were later developed by Brunelleschi and Leonardo da Vinci. In a 1474 letter by Toscanelli to Columbus, the authenticity of which has been a matter of disagreement among scholars,Ranh Phillips, p. 108 Toscanelli mentions the visit of men from Cathay (China) during the reign of Pope Eugenius IV (1431‚Äì1447): It has been suggested that the man in question may have been Niccolo da Conti, who was returning from the east and is known to have met with Pope Eugenius in 1444. Davidson, p.58 In a second letter, Toscanelli describes further these men as extremely learned and willing to share their knowledge: ==See also== *The Pinzon Brothers *Juan de la Cosa ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== *Armando Cortes√£o, Cartografia Portuguesa Antiga, Lisboa, 1960. *Armando Costes√£o, Hist√≥ria da Cartografia Portuguesa, 2 vols., Lisboa, 1969‚Äì1970. *Davidson, Miles H.

It works with hundreds of local partner organisations in some of the world's most vulnerable communities in 37 countries. It is a founder member of the Disasters Emergency Committee, and a major member of the Stop Climate Chaos, The Fairtrade Foundation and Trade Justice Movement campaigns. Christian Aid's headquarters are in London and it has regional teams across the UK and Ireland, plus country offices elsewhere around the world. Christian Aid also organises the UK's largest door-to-door collection, Christian Aid Week, which takes place in May each year. Its director was Loretta Minghella who was appointed in 2010 but resigned in 2017 to work for the Church Commissioners. She was succeeded by the current Chief Executive Officer Amanda Khozi Mukwashi The 2012‚Äì2013 income of Christian Aid was ¬£95.4 million. Development projects Reconstruction after various wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were major projects, alongside the aid given after the overthrow of dictators Idi Amin in Uganda, Somoza family in Nicaragua, and Pol Pot in Cambodia. Yanomami Indians in Brazil were also supported, in a commitment to marginalized peoples. ==Fundraising== Christian Aid raises income from a wide number of sources, such as institutional grants, regular gifts, Christian Aid Week campaign, general donations, legacies, and emergency appeals. In 2013, the institutional income, part of which comes from the Department for International Development and the European Commission, constituted 41% of the total income. A significant percentage of the remaining income comes from thousands of individuals in churches and communities. The main fundraising moments include Christmas, Lent, Easter, Harvest, and Christian Aid Week. In 2013, ¬£12.6 million (or 13% of the total income) were raised during this week. Throughout the year supporters give regularly using direct debit, cash donations, and Will Aid. Churches and community groups also take part in the annual calendar of events (e.g., walks, soup lunches, and quizzes). ==Criticism== Canadian professor Peter Hallward, in his book Damming the Flood, accused Christian Aid of supporting US led violent regime change in Haiti in 2004.Peter Hallward, Damming the Flood (Verso, London, 2008). The development economist Paul Collier in his book The Bottom Billion suggests that Christian Aid \\"deeply misinformed\\" the UK electorate in 2004 and 2005 with a campaign against reducing trade barriers in Africa based on a \\"deeply misleading\\" study conducted by an economist without the requisite expertise and whose purported review \\"by a panel of academic experts\\" who were two people chosen by said economist who were also \\"not noted for their expertise on international trade\\". He quotes an unnamed official at the British Department of Trade and Industry as saying \\"they know it's crap, but it sells the T-shirts\\".Paul Collier, The Bottom Billion, pp. 157‚Äì159 The organization faced criticism from Israeli academic Gerald M. Steinberg in 2005. He wrote for The Jewish News that several of Christian Aid's campaigns, such as a Christmas appeal called 'Child of Bethlehem' focusing on an injured seven-year-old Palestinian child, unfairly presented the complex Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict through a religiously-charged, exclusionary Christian lens. He argued, \\"Victims of the bitter Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict are found on both sides... [y]et Christian Aid... chooses consistently to emphasize only one side\\".

The Charter, enacted under the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government of Ren√© L√©vesque, expanded upon Quebec's previous language legislation, Bill 22, also known as the Official Language Act, enacted in 1974 under the Liberal Party of Quebec government of Robert Bourassa. Earlier language legislation in Quebec had included Bill 63 in 1969, and the La Vergne Law of 1910. Both statutes were drafted in an attempt to follow the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec (the Gendron Commission). Unlike the (Quebec) Official Language Act of 1974 (not to be confused with the federal Official Languages Act), the Charter of the French Language was a legal framework defining the linguistic rights of Quebecers, and a language management policy giving the Government of Quebec the power to intervene in many sectors of public life to promote French as the common language of all citizens. Its enactment by the National Assembly sparked a legal battle that still goes on today. ==Before 1982== In 1867, the British Parliament passed the British North America Act, 1867, now known as the Constitution Act, 1867, which became the supreme law of the Dominion of Canada (although it was modified several times, it is still part of the Constitution of Canada). This act contains only one section (section 133) dealing with language. It reads: \\"Either the English or the French Language may be used by any Person in the Debates of the Houses of the Parliament of Canada and of the Houses of the Legislature of Quebec; and both those Languages shall be used in the respective Records and Journals of those Houses; and either of those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all or any of the Courts of Quebec.\\" \\"The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and of the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages.\\" ===Language of legislation and justice=== Three Quebec Lawyers, Peter Blaikie, Roland Durand and Yoine Goldstein first challenged the constitutionality of the Charter of the French Language under section 133. In 1979, the Supreme Court of Canada declared Chapter III of the Charter of the French Language unconstitutional, citing it contrary to section 133 of the British North America Act of 1867. The highest court in Canada judged that the enacting and passing of laws had to be done in both French and English in the parliaments of Quebec and Canada. Sections 7 to 13 of the Charter of the French Language had made French the only language of legislation and only provided for a translation of laws in English at the end of the legislative process. The Quebec government responded by re-enacting the charter (and all other acts enacted since 1977) in French and English. Sections 7 to 13 of the charter were however left untouched. In 1981, another Supreme Court decision (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Blaikie (No. 2)) declared that section 133 also applied to government regulations. ==After 1982== The patriation of the Canadian Constitution occurred as the British Parliament passed the Canada Act 1982. This act enacted the Constitution Act, 1982 for Canada (including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms), which has two provisions which have provided the basis for further constitutional disputes concerning Quebec's Charter of the French Language. Section 2 of the Charter guarantees freedom of expression, which opens the door to challenges to laws which restrict an individual's ability to use a particular language, while section 23 introduced the notion of \\"minority language education rights\\". Alliance Quebec, an Anglophone rights lobby group was founded in May 1982. It is through this civil association that various anglophone lawyers challenged the constitutionality of Quebec's territorial language policy. ===Language of instruction=== ==== Quebec (A.G.) v. Quebec Protestant School Boards ==== In 1984, the Supreme Court invalidated Chapter VIII of the Quebec Charter of the French Language on the basis of its incompatibility with section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 23 of the Canadian Charter reads: > (1) Citizens of Canada > (a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English > or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they > reside, or > (b) who have received their primary school instruction in Canada in English > or French and reside in a province where the language in which they received > that instruction is the language of the English or French linguistic > minority population of the province, > have the right to have their children receive primary and secondary school > instruction in that language in that province. Section 73 of the Charter of the French language had recognized the right to English language instruction to Quebec residents alone. Canadian citizens from outside Quebec are forced to send their children to French primary and secondary schools, in direct violation of S26.(3) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/, which states that \\"Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.David E. Short, Restrictions on Access to English Language Schools in Quebec: An International Human Rights Analysis, 4 Can.-U.S. L.J. 1 (1981) On July 26, 1984, the Supreme Court invalidated part of Section 73. Judged retroactively unconstitutional, the section had to be modified so that it no longer clashes with the Canadian charter's definition of a linguistic minority. The current Section 73 of the Charter of the French language reads: > The following children, at the request of one of their parents, may receive > instruction in English: > 1) a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and received > elementary instruction in English in Canada, provided that that instruction > constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he or she received > in Canada; > 2) a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and who has received > or is receiving elementary or secondary instruction in English in Canada, > and the brothers and sisters of that child, provided that that instruction > constitutes the major part of the elementary or secondary instruction > received by the child in Canada; > 3) a child whose father and mother are not Canadian citizens, but whose > father or mother received elementary instruction in English in Qu√©bec, > provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary > instruction he or she received in Qu√©bec; > 4) a child who, in their last year in school in Qu√©bec before 26 August > 1977, was receiving instruction in English in a public kindergarten class or > in an elementary or secondary school, and the brothers and sisters of that > child; > 5) a child whose father or mother was residing in Qu√©bec on 26 August 1977 > and had received elementary instruction in English outside Qu√©bec, provided > that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary > instruction he or she received outside Qu√©bec. In 2005, a Supreme Court ruling upheld Section 73 of the Charter of the French language and its corresponding subsections (1 through 5). See Maclean's 5 April 2005, an article by John Geddes entitled \\"Tweaking the Language Laws\\". It maintains that the court upheld S.73 yet provided for flexibility in matters dealing with English-speaking Canadians and immigrants from other countries. ==== Bill 104 ==== In August 2007, the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled that a section of the province's language legislation is unlawful. The judgment stated that Bill 104, an amendment to the Charter passed in 2002 that stopped children of francophone and newcomers from using the English educational system, was contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The amendment was passed to thwart entry to English schools by pupils who had gone to at least one year of an unsubsidized private institution. It had been passed unanimously (by all parties) in the provincial legislature. The Appeal Court verdict disallowed a segment of Bill 104, suggesting that students can be present English public establishments if they have been at an English private academy for a minimum of one year or have been permitted a special dispensation. The Quebec government immediately announced it would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which it did. A judgment was given that delays use of that conclusion until the Supreme Court of Canada judges on a provincial administration request. The challenge to Bill 104 will continue but with funding from the English school boards affected, as the federal Court Challenges Program established for such minority language rights was cut by the Conservative minority government. There is a precedent for having the government pay the fees of the challenging side, or appointing an amicus curiae. A representative of the Quebec Association of Independent Schools proclaimed its goal to strike the delay, and Brent Tyler, the advocate for the 26 families in the case, declared he would pull together an appeal. The Quebec English School Board Association (QESBA) suspected the volume of probable English system learners who might be affected by this result to be 500 annually, the majority of whom would enroll in Montreal schools. It said such a loss to the French school enrollment of almost 1 million would be unimportant. It asked that the decision be respected until it can be referred to the Supreme Court. About half of all enrollment decline in the EMSB since 2002 has resulted from Bill 104, a low fertility rate and urban sprawl being other reasons, said a spokesman. A union of trusts zealous to watch over French is supporting the Quebec government in its venture to overturn the Quebec Appeal Court ruling. Former CSN leader G√©rald Larose, chairman of the Conseil de la souverainet√©, vilified this \\"undermining\\" of the so-called Bill 101 by an \\"English judge\\". (Larose was also the Parti Qu√©b√©cois‚Äìappointed president of a commission on the future of the French language and has agitated for some time that Quebec be granted unshared supremacy over language legislation, despite the Canadian constitution which divides such power between the national and provincial governments.) Jean Dorion, president of the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montr√©al, lamented that Appeals Court judges are appointed by the national government and asserted that they should not have the power to overrule Quebec's language laws. Other commentators remonstrated that Justice Hilton had previously served as legal counsel for Alliance Quebec, an anglophone rights group. Le Devoir reported, however, that the Quebec department of justice did not ask Hilton to recuse himself from the case. Through a spokesperson, the Ministry of Justice said that such a recusal was not necessary and that the government trusts the Court of Appeal to be fair. Parti qu√©b√©cois leader Pauline Marois suggested the ruling could be \\"catastrophic\\" and described it as unsatisfactory. Over the 30-year life of Bill 101 \\"about 4,000 children have used this to get into the English network,\\" she said, as opposed to the French network. ===Language of commercial signs=== ==== Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General) ==== In 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that the sections of the Charter of the French Language enforcing the exclusive use of French on outdoor commercial signs were unconstitutional. The Court-based this decision on the guarantee of freedom of expression in s. 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court remarked that the Quebec government could legitimately require French to have \\"greater visibility\\" or \\"marked predominance\\" on exterior commercial signs, however it could not enforce the exclusive use of French. With the Act to amend the Charter of the French language, S.Q. 1988, c. 54 (also known as Bill 178), the National Assembly (under a Quebec Liberal government) made use of the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian constitution and amended the Charter by allowing English provided that the letters are no larger than half the size of the French. ==== Ballantyne, Davidson, McIntyre v. Canada ==== The use of the notwithstanding clause led to formal complaints by three Quebecers: John Ballantyne, Elizabeth Davidson, and Gordon McIntyre, who own businesses in Sutton, Quebec and Huntingdon, Quebec. In 1993, they brought their case before the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. They challenged sections 1, 6 and 10 of Bill No. 178 enacted by the Quebec legislature on 22 December 1988. They alleged to be victims of violations of articles 2, 19, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the Federal Government of Canada and by the Province of Quebec, due to the Act's prohibitions on the use English in advertising or in the name of their firms. After hearing both parties, the Committee gave its opinion on what it believed to be the three major issues: *(a) whether Sec.58 of the Charter of the French Language, as amended by Bill 178, Sec.1, violates any right that the authors might have by virtue of article 27; *(b) whether Sec.58 of the Charter of the French Language, as amended by Bill 178, Sec.1, violates the authors' right to freedom of expression; *(c) whether the same provision is compatible with the authors' right to equality before the law. * 1. The Committee observed that \\"provisions of article 27 refers to minorities in States\\", which English- speaking people in Canada are not. It stated that the \\"authors therefore have no claim under article 27 of the Covenant\\". * 2. The Committee disagreed with the Government of Quebec which asserted \\"that commercial activities such as outdoor advertising do not fall within the ambit of article 19.\\" The Committee stated \\"Article 19, paragraph 2, must be interpreted as encompassing every form of subjective ideas and opinions capable of transmission to others, which are compatible with article 20 of the Covenant, of news and information, of commercial expression and advertising, of works of art, etc.; it should not be confined to means of political, cultural or artistic expression.\\" The Committee believed that \\"it [was] not necessary, in order to protect the vulnerable position in Canada of the francophone group, to prohibit commercial advertising in English.\\" It suggested that \\"This protection may be achieved in other ways that do not preclude the freedom of expression, in a language of their choice, of those engaged in such fields as trade. For example, the law could have required that advertising be in both French and English.\\" It concluded that \\"A State may choose one or more official languages, but it may not exclude, outside the spheres of public life, the freedom to express oneself in a language of one's choice. The Committee accordingly concludes that there has been a violation of article 19, paragraph 2.\\" * 3. Regarding the right to equality, the Committee found that \\"the authors have not been discriminated against on the ground of their language, and concludes that there has been no violation of article 26 of the Covenant.\\" There were 5 concurring and dissenting opinions, signed by eight Committee members. ==== Internet ==== The Court of Quebec rendered a number of decisions regarding the applicability of the Charter to advertising over the Internet. The court found that commercial websites of businesses that operate from Quebec and sell to Quebec need to conform to the provisions of the Charter regarding the rights of Quebecers to receive services in French. In A.G. of Quebec (Procureur G√©n√©ral) c. Stanley John Reid et Frances Muriel Reid (JE 2002-1266), the defendant raised the argument that the content of Internet is of exclusive federal jurisdiction pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867, and thus its regulation is ultra vires of the Quebec Government. The court confirmed the applicability of the Charter on advertising over the Internet. ===Compliance=== With the Act to amend the Charter of the French language, S.Q. 1993, c. 40 (also known as Bill 86), the National Assembly (under a Quebec Liberal government) amended the Charter of the French Language to make it comply with the Supreme Court rulings. The amending law introduced the \\"Canada Clause\\" which replaced the \\"Quebec Clause\\". That is, the recognized right to English language education was extended to all Canadian citizens. It also introduced the current regulations on the \\"marked predominance\\" of French on outdoor commercial signs in conformity with the Supreme Court suggestion. As suggested by the Supreme Court ruling, the current law specifies that commercial outdoor signs can be multilingual so long as French is markedly predominant. The current provisions regarding exterior commercial signs were confirmed as constitutional by the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. c. Entreprises W.F.H. [2001] R.J.Q. 2557 (C.A.) (also known as \\"The Lyon & the Walrus Case\\"). Today, many businesses choose to put up French-only signs, and at times, even change their registered trademarks to adapt to the Quebec market. Nevertheless, English‚ÄìFrench bilingualism quickly returned on exterior signs after 1993, especially on the island of Montreal. ==See also== * Anglophone problem (Cameroon) * Language planning * Language policy == Notes == == References == ;In English * G√©rald-A.

She was the longest-serving Queen with a tenure of more than 46 years. She was praised for her charity work during the Seven Years' War. ==Crown Princess== Elisabeth Christine, c. 1739, the year before she became Queen. Having failed in his attempt to flee from the tyrannical regime of his father, King Fredrick William I, Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia was ordered to marry a daughter of Duke Ferdinand Albert II and Duchess Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1733 in order to regain his freedom.Biskup, p. 304. Elisabeth was the niece of Empress Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, wife of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. The match had thus been arranged by the Austrian court in the hopes of securing influence over Prussia for another generation. On 12 June, 17-years-old Elisabeth was married to Frederick at her father's summer palace, Schloss Salzdahlum in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany. On their wedding night, Frederick spent a reluctant hour with his wife and then walked about outside for the rest of the night. Due to the circumstances behind their betrothal, he was well known to have resented the marriage from the very beginning. Thus, Elizabeth's position at the Berlin Court was difficult from the beginning, as the only support that she could count on was the King's. Elisabeth indeed remained attached to her father-in-law, who was particularly fond of her piety, which did nothing to endear her husband. It should be mentioned that throughout his life, Frederick didn't show any sexual interest in women and the only woman whom he considered a close friend was his older sister, Wilhelmine. However, he was shrewd enough to recognise the opportunity she provided to improve his own relationship with his father and systematically used her to gain royal favours. During the first year of their marriage, Frederick was garrisoned in Ruppin, while Elisabeth lived in Berlin at the King's court. Her husband showered her with letters asking for travel permits, money, etc., from the King or even demanding that she run up debts in Brunswick to pay for his expenses. This pattern continued even after the couple moved to the palace in Rheinsberg in 1736. ==Queen consort== Queen Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel-Bevern Her summer palace in Sch√∂nhausen, Berlin. After the death of her father-in-law, her husband acceded to the throne of Prussia as Frederick II in 1740. He had no known affairs with women and presided over a very spartan, almost military court where women rarely appeared. He didn't care for ceremonial court life and representation and left most of the posts in his own court vacant at Potsdam.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) During the first years of his reign, he did somewhat revive the court life, but after Sanssouci palace in Potsdam was completed in 1747, he spent his life more isolated in Sanssouci in the summer and the Potsdam royal residence in winter, and only appeared at the official royal court in Berlin at special occasions such as birthdays of members of the royal house and visits of foreign princes. Despite his personal contempt for representational court life, however, he realized its importance in the system of state and therefore didn't abolish court life in Prussia, but rather left virtually all court duties to Elisabeth. Elisabeth therefore had a very visible and official role in Prussia. During the first seventeen years of her husband's reign, she shared the representational duties of the court with her mother-in-law until the latter's death in 1757, When she handled them alone. Frederick gave Elisabeth her own summer residence, Sch√∂nhausen Palace in Berlin, and redecorated her apartments in the Berlin Royal Palace, appointing a large court for her to assist her in upholding the court routine. In Berlin, Elisabeth received foreign princes, ambassadors and generals; entertained the royal family and Prussian aristocracy with concerts; and hosted a circle of Lutheran theologians such as B√ºschning, Spaldning and Z√∂llner. At both residences, she presided at the weekly reception days, courtage, which were the only occasions where the entire Prussian royal court assembled as a whole during the reign of Frederick the Great. Her receptions were always well attended as she hosted the only court life taking place in Prussia at the time, which made it an important social center and a place to meet important people. Elizabeth was described in 1779 by the English tourist Dr. Moore: :\\"The Queen has one Court-day in the week, when the Princes, nobility, and foreign ambassadors wait upon her, at five o' clock. After she has made the tour of the circle, and said a few words to each, she seats herself at the card-table. The Queen has her own table, and each of the Princesses has one. The rest of the company shows itself a moment at each of these card tables, and then the attendance for the day is over, and they walk in the garden, or form other card-tables in the other rooms, as it pleases them, and return to Berlin at dusk. Sometimes the Queen invites a good many of them to supper, and then they remain till midnight. These are the only assemblies where one meets the Berlin ladies in summer.\\"Atkinson, Emma Willsher: Memoirs of the queens of Prussia, London : W. Kent Despite the fact that Frederick entrusted the role of representation to her, he did not always give her the funds necessary to play this role, and it caused surprise to foreigners that the king did not give the queen funds necessary to entertain more lavishly. As the king became more spartan over the years, the receptions of the queen become more underfunded, Charpentier once joking: \\"The Queen must have a grand gala tonight; I saw an old lamp lighted on the staircase as I passed!\\" The king himself only very rarely attended any of the court events, while the queen was always present. He visited the birthday celebration of the queen only twice between 1741 and 1762, was often absent at royal weddings, such as for example the wedding of Prince Henry in 1752 and Prince Frederick William in 1765. Frederick was often absent even at his own official birthday celebration, where she received birthday congratulations in his place, and when he did attend, he normally appeared very briefly. Frederick was often absent even at important functions, such as the state visit of the Russian Grand Duke in 1776. When he did appear in Berlin, Friederick normally didn't represent at his own apartment, but merely visited the Queen's reception in her apartment. While he on rare occasions participated in Berlin court life, he never visited her court at Sch√∂nhausen, nor was she ever invited to Sanssouci. In 1763, when Frederick saw his wife for the first time in six years, he only commented: \\"Madame has grown quite fat.\\" Despite his lack of interest in her person, he demanded that she should be respected in her capacity as a Queen, but his separation from her along with her aroused pity made it hard for her to receive respect from the nobility: on one occasion, the opera singers refused to appear at her concert and she forced him to demand that she be treated with respect. ===Influence=== During the Seven Years' War, the King was permanently absent from the capital for six years, which made the Queen become the symbol of Prussian resilience in the capital during the crisis. When Berlin was threatened in 1757, it was Elisabeth who took the responsibility for the royal house and ordered for its evacuation to Magdeburg. She was able to return to Berlin in 1758, but was again forced to evacuate in 1760. It was on the first of these occasions that she saw Sanssouci for the first time. She was often greeted by cheering crowds when she appeared in public. Elisabeth was interested in political literature and authored several translations under the pseudonym \\"Constance\\". After the death of her friend Sophie Caroline von Camas in 1766, she published a French translation of Le Chr√©tien dans la Solitude. Her translations of the R√©flexions sur l'etat des affaires publiques en 1778 aroused public patriotism during the War of Bavarian Succession. Her political works were included in the royal library and the King presented her with his own ideas. Elisabeth successfully introduced silk cultivation to Prussia and was involved in charity, to which she contributed 23,000 thalers out of her allowance of 40,000 thalers, more than half her income. She said of herself: \\"God has graciously kept me, so that I need not reproach myself for any action by which any person has with my knowledge been hurt.\\"Reiners, Ludwig (Swedish): Fredrik den store (Fredrick the Great). Bokindustri Aktiebolag (1956) Stockholm Elisabeth is noted to have acted as an intermediary and interceded in favor of supplicants. She particularly supported the French √©migr√©s community in Berlin. Spalding commented: \\"her memory will always be blessed as a touching example of the noblest mental qualities, the most enlightened and lively piety, and the most wonderfully active benevolence.\\" ==Queen Dowager== Elisabeth Christine as Queen Dowager. Elisabeth Christine became queen dowager upon the death of Frederick the Great on 17 August 1786. She wasn't present at the death of her spouse and hadn't seen him since January of that year, but was given public sympathy for his death because of the popularity she enjoyed among the public, to all of whom, according to Spalding, she was \\"so dear in her affliction.\\" She commented on the death of Frederick to his successor, Frederick William II, with the words: :\\"Frederic the Great would have been adored for his great qualities had he been only a private individual; all great Princes might take example from him; he reigned like the true father of his people. He was a true friend himself, but he had many false ones, who, under the mask of attachment, separated him from those who were devoted to him heart and soul ; yet these deceitful persons caused him sorrow when he discovered their falsehood, and he rendered justice to his true friends without bringing them into notice, lest he should expose them to persecution. He was generous and beneficent, he maintained his position without hauteur, and in society he was like a private gentleman\\". In the will of Frederick the Great, Elisabeth was secured not only the continuation of her usual income; an additional 10,000 thalers annually; residence, games wine and firewood in the royal palaces of her choice; and a directive that his successor and nephew Fredrick William always treat her with respect due to her position. As Queen Dowager, Elisabeth Christine had an active role in public life. Due to her long experience in handling the representational life of the reign of Frederick the Great, \\"the Queen Dowager, who, by her circumspection and natural dignity, was of more importance than the Queen regnant\\", was often consulted in court matters. She was a center in the family life of the royal house, corresponding with them while they were away, particularly with her former foster daughter Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia. ==Ancestors== ==References== ==Sources== * Biskup, Thomas.

Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry (usually known as Joseph Gratry; 10 March 1805 ‚àí 6 February 1872) was a French author and theologian. ==Life== Gratry was born at Lille and educated at the √âcole Polytechnique of Paris. After a period of mental struggle which he has described in Souvenirs de ma jeunesse, he was ordained priest in Strasbourg 1832. After a stay at Strasbourg as professor of the Petit S√©minaire, he was appointed director of the Coll√®ge Stanislas in Paris in 1842 and, in 1847, chaplain of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor in 1845. In 1852 he and Abb√© Pierre P√©t√©tot revived B√©rulle's Congregation of the Oratory. Gratry was a brilliant academic, holding doctorates in both the humanities and theology. He envisioned communities which could be schools of theological exploration, working with the scientific focus of modern society. He became vicar-general for the bishop of Orleans in 1861, professor of moral theology at the Sorbonne in 1863, and, on the death of Barante, a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1867, where he occupied the seat formerly held by Voltaire. Together with Abb√© Philippe P√©t√©tot, pastor of Saint Roch, and Hyacinthe de Valroger, Joseph Gratry reconstituted the French Oratory, a society of priests mainly dedicated to education. Gratry was one of the principal opponents of the definition of the dogma of papal infallibility, but in this matter he submitted to the declarations of the First Vatican Council. ==Death== Gratry developed throat cancer at the end of his life and went to Montreux, Switzerland, for treatment, where he died.

The concept was coined by Robert Spitzer as a replacement for the term \\"depressive personality\\" in the late 1970s. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), dysthymia is a serious state of chronic depression, which persists for at least two years (one year for children and adolescents). Dysthymia is less acute and severe than major depressive disorder. As dysthymia is a chronic disorder, sufferers may experience symptoms for many years before it is diagnosed, if diagnosis occurs at all. As a result, they may believe that depression is a part of their character, so they may not even discuss their symptoms with doctors, family members or friends. In the DSM-5, dysthymia is replaced by persistent depressive disorder. This new condition includes both chronic major depressive disorder and the previous dysthymic disorder. The reason for this change is that there was no evidence for meaningful differences between these two conditions. ==Signs and symptoms== Dysthymia characteristics include an extended period of depressed mood combined with at least two other symptoms which may include insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue or low energy, eating changes (more or less), low self-esteem, or feelings of hopelessness. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions are treated as another possible symptom. Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may withdraw from daily activities. They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. Additionally, dysthymia often occurs at the same time as other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder. ==Causes== There are no known biological causes that apply consistently to all cases of dysthymia, which suggests diverse origin of the disorder. However, there are some indications that there is a genetic predisposition to dysthymia: \\"The rate of depression in the families of people with dysthymia is as high as fifty percent for the early-onset form of the disorder\\". Other factors linked with dysthymia include stress, social isolation, and lack of social support. In a study using identical and fraternal twins, results indicated that there is a stronger likelihood of identical twins both having depression than fraternal twins. This provides support for the idea that dysthymia is in part caused by heredity. ===Co- occurring conditions=== Dysthymia often co-occurs with other mental disorders. A \\"double depression\\" is the occurrence of episodes of major depression in addition to dysthymia. Switching between periods of dysthymic moods and periods of hypomanic moods is indicative of cyclothymia, which is a mild variant of bipolar disorder. \\"At least three-quarters of patients with dysthymia also have a chronic physical illness or another psychiatric disorder such as one of the anxiety disorders, cyclothymia, drug addiction, or alcoholism\\". Common co-occurring conditions include major depression (up to 75%), anxiety disorders (up to 50%), personality disorders (up to 40%), somatoform disorders (up to 45%) and substance abuse (up to 50%). People with dysthymia have a higher-than-average chance of developing major depression. A 10-year follow-up study found that 95% of dysthymia patients had an episode of major depression. When an intense episode of depression occurs on top of dysthymia, the state is called \\"double depression.\\" ====Double depression==== Double depression occurs when a person experiences a major depressive episode on top of the already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms.Double Depression: Definition, Symptoms, Treatment, and More. Webmd.com (2012-01-07). Retrieved on 2012-07-01. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment. It has been suggested that the best way to prevent double depression is by treating the dysthymia. A combination of antidepressants and cognitive therapies can be helpful in preventing major depressive symptoms from occurring. Additionally, exercise and good sleep hygiene (e.g., improving sleep patterns) are thought to have an additive effect on treating dysthymic symptoms and preventing them from worsening. ==Pathophysiology== There is evidence that there may be neurological indicators of early onset dysthymia. There are several brain structures (corpus callosum and frontal lobe) that are different in women with dysthymia than in those without dysthymia. This may indicate that there is a developmental difference between these two groups. Another study, which used fMRI techniques to assess the differences between individuals with dysthymia and other people, found additional support for neurological indicators of the disorder. This study found several areas of the brain that function differently. The amygdala (associated with processing negative emotions such as fear) was more activated in dysthymia patients. The study also observed increased activity in the insula (which is associated with sad emotions). Finally, there was increased activity in the cingulate gyrus (which serves as the bridge between attention and emotion). A study comparing healthy individuals to people with dysthymia indicates there are other biological indicators of the disorder. An anticipated result appeared as healthy individuals expected fewer negative adjectives to apply to them, whereas people with dysthymia expected fewer positive adjectives to apply to them in the future. Biologically these groups are also differentiated in that healthy individuals showed greater neurological anticipation for all types of events (positive, neutral, or negative) than those with dysthymia. This provides neurological evidence of the dulling of emotion that individuals with dysthymia have learned to use to protect themselves from overly strong negative feelings, compared to healthy people. There is some evidence of a genetic basis for all types of depression, including dysthymia. A study using identical and fraternal twins indicated that there is a stronger likelihood of identical twins both having depression than fraternal twins. This provides support for the idea that dysthymia is caused in part by heredity. A new model has recently surfaced in the literature regarding the HPA axis (structures in the brain that get activated in response to stress) and its involvement with dysthymia (e.g. phenotypic variations of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and down-regulation of adrenal functioning) as well as forebrain serotonergic mechanisms. Since this model is highly provisional, further research is still needed. ==Diagnosis== The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, characterizes dysthymic disorder. The essential symptom involves the individual feeling depressed for the majority of days, and parts of the day, for at least two years. Low energy, disturbances in sleep or in appetite, and low self-esteem typically contribute to the clinical picture as well. Sufferers have often experienced dysthymia for many years before it is diagnosed. People around them often describe the sufferer in words similar to \\"just a moody person\\". Note the following diagnostic criteria:, ICD9, Accessed 2009 May 2 # During a majority of days for two years or more, the adult patient reports depressed mood, or appears depressed to others for most of the day. # When depressed, the patient has two or more of: ## decreased or increased appetite ## decreased or increased sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia) ## Fatigue or low energy ## Reduced self-esteem ## Decreased concentration or problems making decisions ## Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism # During this two-year period, the above symptoms are never absent longer than two consecutive months. # During the duration of the two-year period, the patient may have had a perpetual major depressive episode. # The patient has not had any manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes. # The patient has never fulfilled criteria for cyclothymic disorder. # The depression does not exist only as part of a chronic psychosis (such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder). # The symptoms are often not directly caused by a medical illness or by substances, including drug abuse or other medications. # The symptoms may cause significant problems or distress in social, work, academic, or other major areas of life functioning. In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable, and duration must be at least one year, in contrast to two years needed for diagnosis in adults. Early onset (diagnosis before age 21) is associated with more frequent relapses, psychiatric hospitalizations, and more co-occurring conditions. For younger adults with dysthymia, there is a higher co-occurrence in personality abnormalities and the symptoms are likely chronic. However, in older adults suffering from dysthymia, the psychological symptoms are associated with medical conditions and/or stressful life events and losses. Dysthymia can be contrasted with major depressive disorder by assessing the acute nature of the symptoms. Dysthymia is far more chronic (long lasting) than major depressive disorder, in which symptoms may be present for as little as 2 weeks. Also Dysthymia often presents itself at an earlier age than Major Depressive Disorder. ==Prevention== Though there is no clear-cut way to prevent dysthymia from occurring, some suggestions have been made. Since dysthymia will often first occur in childhood, it is important to identify children who may be at risk. It may be beneficial to work with children in helping to control their stress, increase resilience, boost self-esteem, and provide strong networks of social support. These tactics may be helpful in warding off or delaying dysthymic symptoms.Dysthymia (dysthymic disorder): Prevention. MayoClinic.com (2010-08-26). Retrieved on 2012-07-01. ==Treatments== Persistent depressive disorder can be treated with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The overall rate and degree of treatment success is somewhat lower than for non-chronic depression, and a combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy shows best results.Uher, R. (2014, July 31). Persistent Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, and Chronic Depression: Update on Diagnosis, Treatment. Psychiatric Times, 31, 8, 1-3. Retrieved from https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special- reports/persistent-depressive-disorder-dysthymia-and-chronic-depression- update-diagnosis-treatment ===Therapy=== Psychotherapy can be effective in treating dysthymia. There are many different types of therapy, and some are more effective than others. * The empirically most studied type of treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy is very effective for non-chronic depression, and it appears to be also effective for chronic depression.Margarita Tartakovsky (2020), https://psychcentral.com/disorders/dysthymic-disorder-symptoms/persistent- depressive-disorder-dysthymia-treatment/. psychcentral.com * Cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) has been designed specifically to treat PDD.

September 2020. doi:10.1177/1534650120954275 https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/interpersonal-psychotherapy * Interpersonal psychotherapy has also been said to be effective in treating the disorder, though it only shows marginal benefit when added to treatment with antidepressants.Kriston L, von Wolff A, Westphal A, et al. Efficacy and acceptability of acute treatments for persistent depressive disorder: a network meta-analysis. Depress Anxiety. 2014 Jan 21; [Epub ahead of print]. === Medications === According to a 2014 meta-analysis, antidepressants are at least as effective for persistent depressive disorder as for major depressive disorder. The first line of pharmacotherapy is usually SSRIs due to their purported more tolerable nature and reduced side effects compared to the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Studies have found that the mean response to antidepressant medications for people with dysthymia is 55%, compared with a 31% response rate to a placebo. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants/SSRIs for dysthymia are escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. It often takes an average of 6‚Äì8 weeks before the patient begins to feel these medications' therapeutic effects. Additionally, STAR*D, a multi-clinic governmental study, found that people with overall depression will generally need to try different brands of medication before finding one that works specifically for them. Research shows that 1 in 4 of those who switch medications get better results regardless of whether the second medication is an SSRI or some other type of antidepressant. In a meta-analytic study from 2005, it was found that SSRIs and TCAs are equally effective in treating dysthymia. They also found that MAOIs have a slight advantage over the use of other medication in treating this disorder. However, the author of this study cautions that MAOIs should not necessarily be the first line of defense in the treatment of dysthymia, as they are often less tolerable than their counterparts, such as SSRIs. Tentative evidence supports the use of amisulpride to treat dysthymia but with increased side effects. ===Combination treatment=== A combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy has consistently been shown to be the most effective line of treatment for people diagnosed with dysthymia. Working with a psychotherapist to address the causes and effects of the disorder, in addition to taking antidepressants to help eliminate the symptoms, can be extremely beneficial. This combination is often the preferred method of treatment for those who have dysthymia. Looking at various studies involving treatment for dysthymia, 75% of people responded positively to a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, whereas only 48% of people responded positively to just CBT or medication alone. In a meta-analytic study from 2010, psychotherapy had a small but significant effect when compared to control groups. Psychotherapy was significantly less effective than pharmacotherapy in direct comparisons. However, the benefit of pharmacotherapy was limited to selective serotonin releasing inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). When pharmacotherapy alone was compared with combined treatment with pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, there was a strong trend in favour of combined treatment. A 2019 Cochrane review of 10 studies involving 840 participants could not conclude with certainty that continued pharmacotherapy with antidepressants (those used in the studies) was effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of persistent depressive disorder. The body of evidence was too small for any greater certainty although the study acknowledges that continued psychotherapy may be beneficial when compared to no treatment. ===Resistance=== Because of dysthymia's chronic nature, treatment resistance is somewhat common. In such a case, augmentation is often recommended. Such treatment augmentations can include lithium pharmacology, thyroid hormone augmentation, amisulpride, buspirone, bupropion, stimulants, and mirtazapine. Additionally, if the person also suffers from seasonal affective disorder, light therapy can be useful in helping augment therapeutic effects. ==Epidemiology== Globally dysthymia occurs in about 105 million people a year (1.5% of the population). It is 38% more common in women (1.8% of women) than in men (1.3% of men). The lifetime prevalence rate of dysthymia in community settings appears to range from 3 to 6% in the United States.

His father was Charles Purdue, and his mother was Mary Short Purdue. He had eight sisters and no brothers. Sometime after 1813 (possibly as late as 1823), the family moved to Ross County, Ohio. During the move, the second oldest daughter, Nancy, died, and shortly after the move, his father died. Shortly thereafter John was apprenticed to an Adelphi merchant, and his mother and at least a few of his sisters moved north and settled near Westerville, Ohio. ==Teacher== From 1823 to 1831, he was a school teacher around Ohio and in Michigan. ==Businessman== As stated in the 1979 Marion County History Book, on March 13, 1831, he bought a farm in Salt Rock Township in Marion County, Ohio. He sold the same on August 20, 1832, at a profit. He derived additional gain from collecting a commission in taking his neighbor's hogs to market. Purdue developed a farm products brokerage that covered the Adelphi, Worthington and Columbus area. In 1833, he and Moses Fowler opened a general merchandise store in Adelphi. On December 9, 1834, Purdue purchased of land in Indiana from Jesse Spencer for $850 which he partially paid for in store goods. The land that he bought lies northeast of the intersection of Creasy Lane and McCarty Lane in Lafayette, Indiana. In 1838 or 1839, Purdue and Fowler liquidated their Ohio holdings and permanently moved to Lafayette. Once there, they opened a dry goods business on the courthouse square. Purdue continued to gain wealth and prestige over the next several years. Most accounts show a man devoted to leading a good civic life, donating time, money, and expertise to various local projects including a bridge over the Wabash River, a railroad from Lafayette to Indianapolis and serving on various boards. In 1844, Fowler and Purdue ended their association. In 1847, a group of five merchants, including Purdue, completed a wooden toll bridge across the Wabash. On October 20, 1852, Purdue and four others were appointed as the first trustees of the new Lafayette City Public School. While various tax-related lawsuits crippled the new statewide public school budget, Purdue and others privately helped keep Lafayette's afloat. By 1855, Purdue was spending a fair amount of time in New York doing business. In 1856, he became involved in what would come to be Purdue, Ward and Company. In 1857, he bought stock in and served as a trustee of the Battle Ground Collegiate Institute (college preparatory classes). He also donated $500 in cash to help another collegiate institute in the newly- platted Stockwell, Indiana. Purdue profited greatly during the American Civil War mainly because of the increase in demand for dry goods by the Union Army. Lafayette supported the Union in the war, but some night-time raids by Confederate sympathizers on local businesses were reported. To protect his assets, Purdue established the \\"Purdue Rifles,\\" a volunteer protective force of about 100 trained, uniformed and armed men guarding Confederate prisoners, rounded up deserters and maintained order. Throughout the 1860s, Purdue acquired large tracts of land in Warren county. By 1872, he owned about which came to be known as the Walnut Grove Farm. In 1867, Purdue invested money in and presided as president of the Lafayette Agricultural Works, a Lafayette implement factory, until the mid-1870s. In 1868, he contributed money to and was the president for seven years of the new Springvale Cemetery in Lafayette. In 1869, he helped found the Lafayette Savings Bank. A Freemason, he later supported some questionable business ventures, including backing the Lafayette, Muncie and Bloomington Railroad, even as lawsuits and debts climbed. Purdue also backed a silver mining scheme in Colorado, the Purdue Gold and Silver Mining and Ore Reduction Company, which failed to pay any dividends. ==Politician== In 1864, Purdue lost a contentious primary battle to incumbent Godlove Stein Orth for the nomination of the Union Party's candidate for Congress. In 1866, Purdue again challenged Orth but this time in the general election as an Independent. Despite buying the Lafayette Journal to counteract the Lafayette Courier (which supported Orth), Purdue was again defeated 14,933 to 14,728. ==Purdue University== In 1862, the Morrill Act passed congress, and the competition was on to find a location for a land grant college in Indiana. Bidding was fierce between Indiana University in Bloomington, Northwestern Christian in Indianapolis, and the Stockwell and Battle Ground Collegiate Institutes. After the death of influential Lafayette Senator Albert S. White, the Stockwell bid fell through. Years of wrangling failed to reach a compromise. In 1865, the state started the State Normal College (later Indiana State University), partly to relieve some of the pressure. To make Tippecanoe County stand out, various locals stepped up with offers of land and money. By 1869, Tippecanoe's bid was up to nearly $400,000 in cash, land, and bonds, but the legislature still stalled. Then, Purdue stepped forth with $100,000 of his personal wealth. His only conditions were for the college to be located in Battle Ground and for his surname to be associated with it. After some more negotiations, when the name of the university was chosen and he was added to the board of trustees, Purdue's donations were raised to $150,000 (equivalent to $2.9 million in 2019) and of land. The negotiations also allowed the new board of trustees to choose the site of the university and on May 6th, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students. ==Death== Purdue's gravestone on the Purdue University campus. He died of an apparent stroke on September 12, 1876, on the first day of classes of the third academic year at the university he had helped found. Purdue's grave is located on the university's main campus. A bachelor, he had no heirs so his estate was tied up in litigation for years after his death. ==References== *Kriebel, Robert C.

The figure's tag-line is \\"Heroic Master of Weapons\\". The character was designed by Mattel Visual Designer Mark Taylor, who intended him to be a science-fiction figure to contrast with the line's fantasy barbarian setting. Inspired by Piers Anthony's 1968 novel Sos the Rope, Taylor conceived of Eternia as a planet that once had advanced technology, but had declined into a medieval society. Man-at-Arms was the character that would discover and use the planet's ancient tech. The character's armor was inspired by Spanish conquistadors. When Filmation developed the animated series in 1983, producer Lou Scheimer developed Man-at-Arms as a \\"father figure\\" for He-Man and Teela, a role that was not originally part of the toyline's backstory, to make the characters more appealing to young children. Scheimer added a mustache to the character's look that didn't appear on the toys, \\"to make him look more like an older father figure rather than the same age as Prince Adam and Teela.\\" ==Character history== ===He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)=== In Filmation's animated series, Man-At-Arms‚Äîgiven the \\"real name\\" of Duncan‚Äîdespite being a soldier and a master of weapons is primarily peaceful and prefers alternatives to fighting. Though his stature suggests a warrior, his character is primarily patterned after skilled mechanics and he likes to pass the time working on all the kingdom's vehicles. He is also Teela's foster father (something already mentioned in a couple of pre-Filmation stories), as well as a mentor to Prince Adam. The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull asked Man- At-Arms to adopt Teela because she felt that she could not raise her daughter and protect Castle Grayskull at the same time and believing that if others knew of Teela's true destiny, it would make her daughter a target. Man-At-Arms wears armor which is slightly different from that of the standard uniform of the royal guards. His moustache was not present on the original figure, having been added by Filmation to make him look older, wiser and more fatherly‚Äîalthough original prototype sketches for the Man-At-Arms figure gave him a goatee beard. He is often pestered by the court jester Orko, as Orko's magic tricks often backfire directly at him. Duncan is also one of the three people who know He-Man's secret identity, as explained in the introductory sequence of the original cartoon. Along with Adam / He-Man and Teela, Duncan is one of the cartoon series' central and most often-seen characters. He was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer for the duration of the series. ===Masters of the Universe (1987 film)=== In the 1987 live-action film Masters of the Universe, Man-At-Arms is portrayed by Jon Cypher. The character is shown as a veteran soldier who is still the father of Teela. ===Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen (2002)=== The 2002 cartoon Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen portrays Duncan as a much more serious character and more of a warrior, with a deeper connection to the Sorceress than was previously shown. As in the Filmation series, Man-At-Arms is Teela's adoptive father (and is implied to be her biological father as well). He has a close mentor/student relationship with Adam in addition to aiding He-Man and leading the Masters (as the Heroic Warriors are called in the 2002 version) and is close friends with Adam's father King Randor. It is also revealed that Fisto is his brother. Duncan's mentor, Dekker, also appears in the series. Man-At-Arms was voiced by Garry Chalk, who also voiced He-Man in The New Adventures of He-Man. ===Masters of the Universe: Revelation (2020)=== Man-At-Arms will appear in the upcoming Netflix animated series Masters of the Universe: Revelation, and will be voiced by Liam Cunningham. ===Masters of the Universe (2021 film)=== Duncan will appear in the new live-action Masters of the Universe film, scheduled for release in 2021. He is King Randor's loyal armorer and is knowledgeable in all things weapons-related. He will also serve as a main source of exposition due to his knowledge of Eternia's history. ==Toys== ===Original figure=== Man-At- Arms was one of the first figures created for Mattel's Masters of the Universe line in 1981, the others being He-Man, Skeletor and Beast Man. The figure uses the same basic body as He-Man, with a different head sculpt, and orange chest armor, left-arm and leg armor, and mace. The earliest mini-comics establish Man-At-Arms as one of He-Man's original and most trusted companions. Unlike some other earlier figures, which were dropped in successive releases as new characters came along, Man-At-Arms figures were produced prominently throughout the line's run. However, Mattel never modified the figure to give him his trademark moustache from the cartoon. ===2002 series=== Man-At-Arms was given a new figure as part of the Mattel 2002 Masters of the Universe series. This was the first figure to feature the character with his moustache. Several variants were made of the figure, over the course of the series including a \\"Snake Catcher\\" version as part of the He-Man vs. the Snake Men subline. ===Masters of the Universe Classics toy line=== A new version of Man- At-Arms was released in 2009 as part of Mattel's on-line Masters of the Universe Classics collectors toyline. As with other releases in the series, this figure was heavily influenced by the original 1980s line. The look of the character was based upon his vintage toy packaging artwork. This new version of Man-At-Arms came with interchangeable heads (with and without a moustache), as well as additional weapons‚Äîa sword and small laser pistol, similar in design to those which came with the original 1980s Castle Grayskull playset. Several other versions of Man-At-Arms have since been released in MOTU Classics. These include Snake Man-At-Arms (based on his appearance in the 200X cartoon episode \\"Second Skin\\"), and a Battle Ram version (which includes his 200X helmetless head). ==References== Category:Masters of the Universe Heroic Warriors Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1983 ","title":"Man-At-Arms"},{"id":"1295963","text":"The empennage of a Boeing 747-200 The empennage ( or ), also known as the tail or tail assembly, is a structure at the rear of an aircraft that provides stability during flight, in a way similar to the feathers on an arrow.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, p. 194. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, From the Ground Up, p. 10 (27th revised edition) The term derives from the French language word empenner which means \\"to feather an arrow\\". Most aircraft feature an empennage incorporating vertical and horizontal stabilising surfaces which stabilise the flight dynamics of yaw and pitch, as well as housing control surfaces. In spite of effective control surfaces, many early aircraft that lacked a stabilising empennage were virtually unflyable. Even so-called \\"tailless aircraft\\" usually have a tail fin (usually a vertical stabiliser). Heavier-than-air aircraft without any kind of empennage (such as the Northrop B-2) are rare, and generally use specially shaped airfoils whose trailing edge provide pitch stability, and rearwards swept wings, often with dihedral to provide the necessary yaw stability. In some aircraft with swept wings, the airfoil section or angle of incidence may change radically towards the tip. ==Structure== Structurally, the empennage consists of the entire tail assembly, including the tailfin, the tailplane and the part of the fuselage to which these are attached. On an airliner this would be all the flying and control surfaces behind the rear pressure bulkhead. The front (usually fixed) section of the tailplane is called the tailplane or horizontal stabiliser and is used to provide pitch stability. The rear section is called the elevator, and is usually hinged to the horizontal stabiliser. The elevator is a movable aerofoil that controls changes in pitch, the up-and-down motion of the aircraft's nose. Some aircraft employ an all-moving stabiliser and elevators in one unit, known as a stabilator or \\"full-flying stabiliser\\". The vertical tail structure (or fin) has a fixed front section called the vertical stabiliser, used to restrict side-to-side motion of the aircraft (yawing). The rear section of the vertical fin is the rudders, a movable aerofoil that is used to turn the aircraft's nose to one side or the other. When used in combination with the ailerons, the result is a banking turn, often referred to as a \\"coordinated turn\\". Some aircraft are fitted with a tail assembly that is hinged to pivot in two axes forward of the fin and stabiliser, in an arrangement referred to as a movable tail. The entire empennage is rotated vertically to actuate the horizontal stabiliser, and sideways to actuate the fin.Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, From the Ground Up, p. 14 (27th revised edition) The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder and emergency locator transmitter (ELT) are often located in the empennage, because the aft of the aircraft provides better protection for these in most aircraft crashes. == Trim == In some aircraft trim devices are provided to eliminate the need for the pilot to maintain constant pressure on the elevator or rudder controls.Reichmann, Helmet: Flying Sailplanes, p. 26. Thompson Publications, 1980. The trim device may be: *a trim tab on the rear of the elevators or rudder which act to change the aerodynamic load on the surface. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank.Transport Canada: Flight Training Manual 4th Edition, p. 12. Gage Educational Publishing Company, 1994. *an adjustable stabiliser into which the stabiliser may be hinged at its spar and adjustably jacked a few degrees in incidence either up or down. Usually controlled by a cockpit crank.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, p. 524. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. *a bungee trim system which uses a spring to provide an adjustable preload in the controls. Usually controlled by a cockpit lever. *an anti-servo tab used to trim some elevators and stabilators as well as increased control force feel. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank. *a servo tab used to move the main control surface, as well as act as a trim tab. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank. Multi-engined aircraft often have trim tabs on the rudder to reduce the pilot effort required to keep the aircraft straight in situations of asymmetrical thrust, such as single engine operations. ==Tail configurations== Aircraft empennage designs may be classified broadly according to the fin and tailplane configurations. The overall shapes of individual tail surfaces (tailplane planforms, fin profiles) are similar to wing planforms. ===Tailplanes=== The tailplane comprises the tail-mounted fixed horizontal stabiliser and movable elevator. Besides its planform, it is characterised by: *Number of tailplanes - from 0 (tailless or canard) to 3 (Roe triplane) *Location of tailplane - mounted high, mid or low on the fuselage, fin or tail booms. *Fixed stabiliser and movable elevator surfaces, or a single combined stabilator or flying tail.Anderson, John D., Introduction to Flight, 5th ed, p. 517 (General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark) Some locations have been given special names: *Cruciform tail - The horizontal stabilisers are placed midway up the vertical stabiliser, giving the appearance of a cross when viewed from the front. Cruciform tails are often used to keep the horizontal stabilisers out of the engine wake, while avoiding many of the disadvantages of a T-tail. Examples include the Hawker Sea Hawk and Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. *T-tail - The horizontal stabiliser is mounted on top of the fin, creating a \\"T\\" shape when viewed from the front. T-tails keep the stabilisers out of the engine wake, and give better pitch control. T-tails have a good glide ratio, and are more efficient on low speed aircraft. However, the T-tail has several disadvantages. It is more likely to enter a deep stall, and is more difficult to recover from a spin. For this reason a small secondary stabiliser or tail-let may be fitted lower down where it will be in free air when the aircraft is stalled.Ralph D. Kimberlin, Flight Testing of Fixed Wing Aircraft, AIAA 2003, p.380. A T-tail must be stronger, and therefore heavier than a conventional tail. T-tails also tend to have a larger radar cross section. Examples include the Gloster Javelin and McDonnell Douglas DC-9. { align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - alt=\\" \\" Fuselage mounted alt=\\" \\" Cruciform alt=\\" \\" T-tail alt=\\" \\" Flying tailplane } ===Fins=== The fin comprises the fixed vertical stabiliser and rudder. Besides its profile, it is characterised by: *Number of fins - usually one or two. *Location of fins - on the fuselage (over or under), tailplane, tail booms or wings Twin fins may be mounted at various points: *Twin tail A twin tail, also called an H-tail, consists of two small vertical stabilisers on either side of the horizontal stabiliser. Examples include the Antonov An-225 Mriya, B-25 Mitchell, Avro Lancaster, and ERCO Ercoupe. *Twin boom A twin boom has two fuselages or booms, with a vertical stabiliser on each, and a horizontal stabiliser between them. Examples include the P-38 Lightning, de Havilland Vampire, Sadler Vampire, and Edgley Optica. *Wing mounted midwing as on the F7U Cutlass or on the wing tips as on the Handley Page Manx and Rutan Long-EZ { align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - alt=\\" \\" Tailplane mounted alt=\\" \\" Twin tail boom alt=\\" \\" Wing mounted } Unusual fin configurations include: *No fin - as on the McDonnell Douglas X-36. This configuration is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"tailless\\". *Multiple fins - examples include the Lockheed Constellation (three), Bellanca 14-13 (three), and the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye (four). *Ventral fin - underneath the fuselage. Often used in addition to a conventional fin as on the (North American X-15 and Dornier Do 335). { align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - alt=\\" \\" Triple fins alt=\\" \\" Ventral fin } ===V, Y and X tails=== An alternative to the fin-and-tailplane approach is provided by the V-tail and X-tail designs. Here, the tail surfaces are set at diagonal angles, with each surface contributing to both pitch and yaw. The control surfaces, sometimes called ruddervators, act differentially to provide yaw control (in place of the rudder) and act together to provide pitch control (in place of the elevator). *V tail: A V-tail can be lighter than a conventional tail in some situations and produce less drag, as on the Fouga Magister trainer, Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk RPV and X-37 spacecraft. A V-tail may also have a smaller radar signature. Other aircraft featuring a V-tail include the Beechcraft Model 35 Bonanza, and Davis DA-2. A slight modification to the V-tail can be found on the Waiex and Monnett Moni called a Y-tail. *Inverted V tail:The unmanned Predator uses an inverted V-tail as do the Lazair and Mini-IMP. *Y tail: A V-tail with an added lower vertical fin (generally used to protect an aft propeller), as LearAvia Lear Fan *X tail: The Lockheed XFV and Convair XFY Pogo both featured \\"X\\" tails, which were reinforced and fitted with a wheel on each surface so that the craft could sit on its tail and take off and land vertically. { align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - alt=\\" \\" V-tail alt=\\" \\" Inverted V-tail alt=\\" \\" X-tail } ===Outboard tail=== SpaceShipOne at the US National Air and Space Museum An outboard tail is split in two, with each half mounted on a short boom just behind and outboard of each wing tip. It comprises outboard horizontal stabilizers (OHS) and may or may not include additional boom- mounted vertical stabilizers (fins). In this position, the tail surfaces interact constructively with the wingtip vortices and, with careful design, can significantly reduce drag to improve efficiency, without adding unduly to the structural loads on the wing.Kurt W. Muller; \\"Analysis of a Semi-Tailless Aircraft Design\\" (Master's thesis), Naval Postgraduate School, US, 2002. The configuration was first developed during World War II by Richard Vogt and George Haag at Blohm & Voss. The Skoda-Kauba SL6 tested the proposed control system in 1944 and, following several design proposals, an order was received for the Blohm & Voss P 215 just weeks before the war ended.Zdenek Titz and Jaroslav Zazvonil; \\"Kauba's Dwarfs\\", Flying Review International, Nov 1965, pp.169-172.Pohlmann, Hermann. Chronik Eines Flugzeugwerkes 1932-1945. B&V; \\\\- Blohm & Voss Hamburg - HFB Hamburger Flugzeugbau (in German). Motor Buch Verlag, 1979 . The outboard tail reappeared on the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne in 2003 and SpaceShipTwo in 2010.Benjamin Darrenougue; \\"Aircraft Configurations With Outboard Horizontal Stabilizers\\" (Final year project report), Queens University Belfast, 14 May 2004. ===Tailless aircraft=== DH108 Swallow A tailless aircraft (often tail-less) traditionally has all its horizontal control surfaces on its main wing surface. It has no horizontal stabiliser - either tailplane or canard foreplane (nor does it have a second wing in tandem arrangement). A 'tailless' type usually still has a vertical stabilising fin (vertical stabiliser) and control surface (rudder). However, NASA adopted the 'tailless' description for the novel X-36 research aircraft which has a canard foreplane but no vertical fin. The most successful tailless configuration has been the tailless delta, especially for combat aircraft. == See also == * Trijet * S-duct * Tail-sitter ==References== Category:Aircraft components ","title":"Empennage"},{"id":"1295973","text":"Coke Machine Glow is the first solo album released by Gord Downie, the singer for The Tragically Hip.

It is a portmanteau of \\"corpse\\" and \\"popsicle\\". ==Origins== Its earliest printed usage in the current form dates from 1969 in science fiction author Fred Pohl's book The Age of the Pussyfoot, in which a corpsicle is referred to as \\"a zombie frozen in Alaska.\\" The previous spelling, \\"corpse-sicle\\", also attributed to Pohl, appeared in the essay Immortality Through Freezing, published in the August 1966 issue of Worlds of Tomorrow.Science Fiction Citations Database for the Oxford English DictionaryInternet Speculative Fiction Database ==Later usage== Larry Niven employed the term in Rammer (1971), a short story in his collection A Hole in Space, originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction, later enlarged into the novel, A World Out of Time (1976). Niven's protagonist is awakened in a society which gives no legal rights whatsoever to corpsicles. In The Integral Trees (1983) and its 1987 sequel The Smoke Ring, set in the same universe, the pejorative term eventually becomes worn down to \\"copsik,\\" meaning \\"slave.\\" Niven also uses the term in The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton novella The Defenseless Dead, published in 1973. The story includes debate about the legal right of frozen persons to continued physical support after their personal funds are exhausted. Dennis E. Taylor used the term in his \\"Bobiverse\\" trilogy, concerning a corpsicle who is transferred to a Von Neumann probe, and his subsequent derivatives. Ben Bova uses the term in his 2001 novel The Precipice. In this novel, many subjects have been cryonically preserved; however those who are revived have lost all their memories. In cinema, the term features in Paul W. S. Anderson's Event Horizon (1997), albeit used to refer to frozen remains with no hope of revival.

It is a title of respect or courtesy, equivalent to the English Sir. It was used in the Ottoman Empire and Byzantine Empire. It follows the personal name, when it is used, and is generally given to members of the learned professions and to government officials who have high ranks, such as bey or pasha. It may also indicate a definite office, as hekim efendi, chief physician to the sultan. The possessive form efendim (my master) is used by servants, in formal discourse, when answering the telephone, and can substitute for \\"excuse me\\" in some situations (e.g. asking someone to repeat something). In the Ottoman era, the most common title affixed to a personal name after that of agha was efendi. Such a title would have indicated an \\"educated gentleman\\", hence by implication a graduate of a secular state school (r√º≈üdiye), even though at least some if not most of these efendis had once been religious students, or even religious teachers. Lucy Mary Jane Garnett wrote in the 1904 work Turkish Life in Town and Country that Ottoman Christians, women, mullahs, sheiks, and princes of the Ottoman royal family could become effendi, a title carrying \\"the same significance as the French Monsieur\\" and which was one of two \\"merely conventional designations as indefinite as our \\"Esquire\\" has come to be.[in the United Kingdom]\\".Garnett, Lucy Mary Jane. Turkish Life in Town and Country. G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904. p. 5. The Republican Turkish authorities abolished the title circa the 1930s.Shaw, Stanford J. and Ezel Kural Shaw. History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II). Cambridge University Press, 27 May 1977. , 9780521291668. p. 386. ==Etymology== The Ottoman Turkish word , in modern Turkish , is a borrowing of the Medieval Greek afendƒìs, from Ancient Greek authentƒìs, \\"master, author, doer, perpetrator\\" (cf. authentic).. This word was widely used as a Greek title for Byzantine nobles as late as 1465, such as in the letters of Cardinal Bessarion concerning the children of Thomas Paleologus. ==Other uses== * Effendi () was also considered a title for a man of high education or social standing in an eastern (Mediterranean or Middle Eastern) country. It was an analogous to esquire, and junior to bey in Egypt during the period of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and was used a lot among the Egyptians. *Effendi is still used as an honorific in Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey (as well as some other former Ottoman states), and is the source of the word ÿ£ŸÅŸÜÿØŸÖÿü afandim?, , a particularly polite way of saying, \\"Excuse me?\\",Hans- J√ºrgen Kornrumpf (1979) Langenscheidt's Universal Dictionary, Turkish-English, English-Turkish, Langenscheidt KG, Berlin and Leipzig and can be used in answering the phone. *The colonial forces of British East Africa and German East Africa were built from a stock of Sudanese soldiers of the Egyptian army, which was nominally under the Ottoman Empire. These units entered East Africa with some officers who brought their title of effendi with them and, thus, it continued to be used for non-European officers of the two colonial forces. Up to the present the Swahili form afande is a way to address officers in the armies of Kenya, TanzaniaSee entry \\"Afande\\" in TUKI KAMUSI YA KISWAHILI- KIINGEREZA, by Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili, Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam; Toleo la 1 Edition (January 1, 2001), online here; \\"afande: respectful or formal address used by a soldier to his/her superior; respectful or formal answer of a soldier to his/her superior's call.\\" and recently in Rwanda with the coming to power of RPF. ** Effendi (Governor's Commissioned Officer) was the highest rank that a Black African could achieve in the British King's African Rifles (KAR) until 1961 (from then, promotions to commissioned officers became possible). They were equivalent to the Viceroy's Commissioned Officers in the British Indian Army. An Effendi's authority was confined to other KAR troops (Askaris), and he could not command British troops. The KAR rank came into disuse during the 1930s and was reintroduced in 1956. ** Effendi was also a non-European's officer rank in the Schutztruppe of German East Africa. Similar to the above British practice, Effendis were promoted by a governor's warrant, not by a kaiser's commission, as white commissioned officers were. Effendis had no authority over white troops. In the Schutztruppe this rank was used, together with other ranks of Ottoman origin like \\"Tschausch\\" (sergeant) and \\"Ombascha\\" (corporal). * In Bosnia and Herzegovina \\"Efendija\\" refers to Muslim clerics. * In Indonesia and Malaysia, \\"Effendi\\" can be used as a first name. * In Pakistan and India, \\"Effendi\\" is the surname of some families whose ancestors migrated from Turkey or Afghanistan. * In Afghanistan, some members of the former ruling Barakzai clan of Durranis also use \\"Effendi\\" or a variant \\"Affandi\\" as their surname. * In China, \\"Effendi\\" (ÈòøÂá°Êèê) often refers to Nasreddin. * Jazz pianist McCoy Tyner has one composition named \\"Effendi\\".

Madero into Mexico City in 1911. The corrido () is a popular narrative metrical tale and poetry that forms a ballad. The songs are often about oppression, history, daily life for criminals, and other socially relevant topics. It is still a popular form today in Mexico and was widely popular during the Mexican Revolutions of the 20th century. The corrido derives largely from the romance, and in its most known form consists of a salutation from the singer and prologue to the story, the story itself, and a moral and farewell from the singer. Outside Mexico corridos are popular in Chilean national-day celebrations of Fiestas Patrias. ==History== An example of a corrido song sheet or sheet music, this one from 1915 at the height of the Mexican Revolution. Corridos play an important part in Mexican culture. Corridos have a long history in Mexico, starting from the Mexican War of Independence in 1810 and throughout the Mexican Revolution. Until the arrival and success of electronic mass-media (mid-20th century), the corrido served in Mexico as the main informational and educational outlet, even with subversive purposes, due to an apparent linguistic and musical simplicity that lent itself to oral transmission. After the spread of radio and television, the genre evolved into a new stage and is still in the process of maturation. Some scholars, however, consider the corrido to be dead or moribund in more recent times (see e.g. Vicente T. Mendoza, El corrido mexicano, 1954). In more rural areas where Spanish and Mexican cultures have been preserved because of isolation, the romance has taken on other forms related to the corrido as well. In New Mexico, for example, a story-song emerged during the colonial period that was known as an Indita, which loosely follows the format of a corrido, but is chanted rather than sung, similar to a Native American chant, hence the name Indita. The earliest living specimens of corrido are adapted versions of Spanish romances or European tales, mainly about disgraced or idealized love, or religious topics. These, that include (among others) \\"La Martina\\" (an adaptation of the romance \\"La Esposa Infiel\\") and \\"La Delgadina\\", show the same basic stylistic features of the later mainstream corridos (1/2 or 3/4 tempo and verso menor lyric composing, meaning verses of eight or less phonetic syllables, grouped in strophes of six or less verses). Beginning with the Mexican War of Independence (1810‚Äì1821) and culminating during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1921), the genre flourished and acquired its \\"epic\\" tones, along with the three-step narrative structure as described above. A contemporary corrido song sheet of La cucaracha issued during the Mexican Revolution. Note the original lyrics and the reference to cartoncitos, which were a type of scrip issued as pay. Some corridos may be love stories. These are not exclusively male by any means, there are also corridos about women such as La Venganza de Maria, Laurita Garza, El Corrido de Rosita Alvirez and La Adelita, or couples such as La Fama de la Pareja sung by Los Tigres del Norte. Some even employ fictional stories invented by their composers. Prior to widespread use of radio, popular corridos were passed around as an oral tradition, often to spread news of events (for example, La c√°rcel de Cananea) and popular heroes and humor to the population, many of whom were illiterate prior to the post-Revolution improvements to the educational system. Academic study of corridos written during the Revolution shows that they were used as a means to communicate news throughout Mexico as a response to the propaganda being spread in the newspapers which were owned by the corrupt government of Porfirio D√≠az. Sheet music of popular corridos was sold or included in publications. Other corrido sheets were passed out free as a form of propaganda, to eulogize leaders, armies, and political movements, or in some cases to mock the opposition. The best known Revolutionary corrido is La Cucaracha, an old song that was rephrased to celebrate the exploits of Pancho Villa's army and poke fun at his nemesis Victoriano Huerta. With the consolidation of \\"Presidencialismo\\" (the political era following the Mexican Revolution) and the success of electronic mass- media, the corrido lost its primacy as a mass communication form, becoming part of a folklorist cult in one branch and, in another, the voice of the new subversives: oppressed workers, drug growers or traffickers, leftist activists and emigrated farmworkers (mainly to the United States). This is what scholars designate as the \\"decaying\\" stage of the genre, which tends to erase the stylistic or structural characteristics of \\"revolutionary\\" or traditional corrido without a clear and unified understanding of its evolution. This is mainly signified by the \\"narcocorrido\\", many of which are egocentric ballads paid for by drug smugglers to anonymous and almost illiterate composers (more about this assertion here l), but with others coming from the most popular norte√±o and banda artists and written by some of the most successful and influential ranchera composers. Toma de Ciudad Ju√°rez In the Mestizo-Mexican cultural area the three variants of corrido (romance, revolutionary and modern) are both alive and sung, along with popular sister narrative genres, such as the \\"valona\\" of Michoac√°n state, the \\"son arribe√±o\\" of the Sierra Gorda (Guanajuato, Hidalgo and Quer√©taro states) and others. Its vitality and flexibility allow original corrido lyrics to be built on non-Mexican musical genres, such as blues and ska, or with non-Spanish lyrics, like the famous song El Paso by Marty Robbins, and corridos composed or translated by Mexican indigenous communities or by the \\"Chicano\\" people in the United States, in English or \\"Spanglish\\". The corrido was, for example, a favorite device employed by the Teatro Campesino led by Luis Valdez in mobilizing largely Mexican and Mexican-American farmworkers in California during the 1960s. Corridos have seen a renaissance in the 21st century. Contemporary corridos feature contemporary themes such as drug trafficking (narcocorridos), immigration, migrant labor and even the Chupacabra. == Subcategories == ===Narcocorridos=== Modern artists have created a modern twist to the historical corridos. These new type of corridos are called narcocorridos (literally \\"drug-ballad\\"). The earliest form of corridos emerged in the Mexican Revolution and they told stories of revolutionary leaders and stories of battles. Narcocorridos typically use real dates and places to tell mainly stories of drug smuggling, but also include violence, murder, poverty corruption, and crime. The border zone of Rio Grande has been credited with being the birthplace of Narcocorridos. This began in the sixties with the fast growth of drug empires in the border states of Mexico and the United States. As drug lords grew, people idolized them and began to show their respect and admiration through narcocorridos. There are two main types of narcocorridos: commercial corridos and private corridos. Commercial narcocorridos recorded made by famous artists who idolize a certain drug dealer and release a song about him, while private narcocorridos are usually commissioned by the drug dealer himself. While commercial corridos are available to the public, private narcocorridos are restricted to night-clubs that are frequently attended by drug dealers, or through CDs bought on the street. Drug lords have enough money to make even the most famous and popular bands write a narcocorrido for them. The Mexican government has tried to ban narcocorridos because for their explicit and controversial lyrics. Most of the Mexican public argues that crimes and violence are to blame for narcocorridos. However, despite the efforts of the Mexican government to ban narcocorridos, the northern states of Mexico can still get access to these songs through US radio stations whose signal still reaches the northern states of Mexico. Narcocorridos are also widely available on websites like Youtube and iHeartRadio. Today, narcocorridos are popular in other Latin American countries like Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Guatemala and Honduras. Narcocorridos have been growing in popularity in the United States and they have been targeted for the American public. More recent narcocorridos are even targeted towards the American public and some are even written in English. Like many artists, narcocorrido singers have chosen American cities to perform concerts because the American public can buy concert tickets for a higher price than the average Mexican citizen. === Trapcorridos === \\"Trapcorridos\\" are Southern California corrido ballads influenced by hip-hop. == Form == Corridos, like rancheras, have introductory instrumental music and adornos (ornamentations) accommodating the stanzas of the lyrics. Like rancheras, corridos can be played in virtually all Regional Mexican styles. Also like rancheras, corridos are usually played in Polka, Waltz, or Mazurka mode. ==Films== *2006 - Al Otro Lado (To the Other Side).

John of Seville translated a litany of Arabic astrological works, and is also credited with the production of several original works in Latin. ==Life and Context== John of Seville was a baptized Jew, whose Jewish name (now unknown) has been corrupted into \\"Avendeut\\", \\"Avendehut\\", \\"Avendar\\" or \\"Aven Daud\\". This evolved into the middle name \\"David\\", so that, as a native of Toledo, he is frequently referred to as Johannes (David) Toletanus. Some historians argue that in fact there were two different persons with a similar name, one as Juan Hispano (Ibn Dawud) and other as Juan Hispalense, this last one perhaps working at Galician Limia (Ourense), for he signed himself as \\"Johannes Hispalensis atque Limiensis\\", during the Reconquista, the Christian campaign to regain the Iberian Peninsula. Though his precise birthdate and death date remain unknown, he is known to have flourished in his work from 1133 to 1153. ==Translated and Original works== Since John of Seville had gone by multiple names throughout his lifetime, it is often debated by historians as to which translations of this time period were actually his. The topics of his translated works were mainly astrological, astronomical, philosophical and medical. John of Seville's particular style of translation is recognized by scholars due to his proclivity to translate works, word for word, while continuing to maintain the original language's syntax and grammatical structure. === Astrological and Astronomical === John of Seville translated Al-Farghani's Kitab Usul 'ilm al- nujum (Book on the Elements of the Science of Astronomy) into Latin in 1135 ('era MCLXXIII')under the revised title of (The Rudiments of Astronomy),Astronomy, astrology, observatories and calendars, A. Akmedov, History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. 4, Part 2 ed. Clifford Edmund Bosworth, M.S.Asimov, (Motilal Banarsidass, 2000), 198. as well as translating the Arab astrologer Albohali's \\"Book of Birth\\" into Latin in 1153.Houtsma, p.875 This also includes the work to translate another one of Al-Farghani‚Äôs works titled KitƒÅb fƒ´ JawƒÅmi ø  øIlm al-Nuj≈´m (Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions). He also translated KitƒÅb ta·∏•ƒÅwƒ´l sinƒ´ al-‚ÄòƒÅlam (Flowers of Abu Ma'shar) by Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi into Latin. More notable works of John of Seville include the translations of a manuscript in the library of St. Marks, the Greater Introduction of Albumasar, and the engraved written work of Thebit. Another astronomical work translated by John is De compositione et utilitate astrolabii (The composition and utility of the astrolabe) which is an instructional book explaining the construction of and the how to of astrolabes. The work itself is originally attributed to the Aribic astronomer Mash‚Äôallah. Another significant work translated by John of Seville was Omar‚Äôs (Umar Ibn al-Farrukh√¢n al-Tabar√Æ) work, Kit√¢b al-Maw√¢lid (The Book of Nativities), under the Latin title ‚ÄúDe Nativitatibus.‚Äù Kit√¢b al-Maw√¢lid is an astrological treatise concerning ‚Äúthe interpretation of nativities, or birth horoscopes,‚Äù it has three separate books with quotes from other authors such as Ptolemy, Messahallah and Hermes. === Medical and Alchemy === At least three of his translations, a short version of the Secretum Secretorum dedicated to a Queen Tarasia, a tract on gout offered to one of the Popes Gregory, and the original version of the 9th century Arabic philosopher Qusta ibn Luqa's De differentia spiritus et animae (The Difference Between the Spirit and the Soul), were medical translations intermixed with alchemy in the Hispano-Arabic tradition.Goulding, Robert. Speculum, vol. 82, no. 2, 2007, pp. 494‚Äì495. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20464144. A lesser known translation of his titled Speculum Elementorum, also referred to as Tractatus de perfecta et infallibili Medicina arte Akimie, was originally written by an unknown author. Another notable work translated by John of Seville from arabic is the Emerald Tablet, an alchemical work of the Hermetic tradition that is originally credited to Hermes Trismeguistus himself, it was said to contain many alchemical secrets. === Philosophical === In his Book of Algorithms on Practical Arithmetic, John of Seville provides one of the earliest known descriptions of Indian positional notation, whose introduction to Europe is usually associated with the book Liber Abaci by Fibonacci: :‚ÄúA number is a collection of units, and because the collection is infinite (for multiplication can continue indefinitely), the Indians ingeniously enclosed this infinite multiplicity within certain rules and limits so that infinity could be scientifically defined; these strict rules enabled them to pin down this subtle concept.‚Äù John of Seville is also credited with working in collaboration with Dominicus Gundissalinus and Jewish philosopher Abraham Ibn Daud to translate the De anima of Avicenna, a philosophical commentary on Aristotle's writings. Avicenna had many other of his works translated such as a philosophical encyclopedia titled Kitab al-Shifa‚Äô (The Book of Healing) and a short script on metaphysics titled Liber de Causis (Book of Causes). John even retranslated an original Avicenna translation of Aristotle‚Äôs On the Heavens. It is speculated that the written work of Zael, titled Liber temporum, may have been translated by John of Seville. However, the name of the translator was never mentioned in the manuscript so it remains uncertain. A work by Jewish philosopher Avencebrol is believed to be translated by both John of Seville and Dominicus Gundissalinus titled Fons Vitae (Source of Life). Another one of John of Seville's philosophical translation includes the work by philosopher Al-Ghazali titled Maqasid al-falasifa (The Aims of the Philosophers), a book regarding basic philosophical concepts such as judgement, concept and logic. === Original === In addition to his many translations John of Seville is credited with a work of his own titled, Epitome artis astrologiae, written in 1142 which is a summary of astrology as a whole. ==See also== *New Christian: converso & marrano *Toledo School of Translators *Latin translations of the 12th century ==References== ==External links== * M.

It was developed by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green, as an alternative to carbon paper and is sometimes misidentified as such. Instead of inserting a special sheet in between the original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink on the back side of the top sheet, and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery. == Operation == Carbonless copy paper consists of sheets of paper that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a Coated Back or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB). When the sheets are written on with pressure (e.g., ball-point pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, dot-matrix printer), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate. Carbonless copy paper was also available in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay on the same side of the paper. == Uses == Carbonless copy paper was first produced by the NCR Corporation, applying for a patent on June 30, 1953. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g., white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it. == Dyes and chemicals == The first dye used commercially in this application was crystal violet lactone, which is widely used today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (p-toluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol), TMA (trimellitic anhydride), phenol- formaldehyde resins, azo dyes, DIPN (diisopropyl naphthalenes), formaldehyde isocyanates, hydrocarbon-based solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyoxypropylene diamine, epoxy resins, aliphatic isocyanates, Bisphenol A, diethylene triamine, and others. The dyes in carbonless copy papers may cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons. == Health and environmental concerns == Until the 1970s, when the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and environmental concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper. PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, and it is difficult to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, carbonless copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste. Exposure to certain types of carbonless copy paper or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with carbonless copy paper produced after 1987. In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands. In a 1997 study, the University of Florida found that a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of carbonless copy paper were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The study also found that there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless copy paper. Another study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma. The average carbonless copy paper contains a high concentration of Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor. In 2001, three employees of a medical center in San Francisco filed a lawsuit against their employer, blaming exposure to carbonless copy paper and other chemicals for their inflammatory breast cancer. With the increasing adoption of inexpensive inkjet printers and laser printers on computer systems since the 1980s, the use of carbonless multipart forms in businesses has declined, as it is simpler to make copies of documents. == See also == * Spirit duplicator AKA Ditto machine * List of duplicating processes == Notes == == References == * U. of FLA News * Business Weeks Expose' * A Paper Trail == External links == * Patent: Pressure-sensitive record material * Hazard Review: Carbonless Copy Paper, from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. * Scientist Test Carbonless Copy Paper for Sickening Side Effect Category:Coated paper Category:Paper Category:Occupational safety and health Category:American inventions Category:NCR products de:Durchschreibepapier#Durchschreibepapiere ohne Kohleschicht ","title":"Carbonless copy paper"},{"id":"1296031","text":"Young Americans is an American drama television series created by Steven Antin. The show debuted on July 12, 2000 on The WB network as a summer replacement for, and spin-off from another Columbia TriStar Television production, Dawson's Creek. The series was originally ordered for the 1999‚Äì2000 television season with a planned fall debut, but was delayed due to unresolved matters between Columbia TriStar and The WB. The main character, Will Krudski, was introduced late in season three of Dawson's Creek as a childhood friend of the group who has kept in contact with Pacey Witter. The show explores themes of forbidden love, morality, social classes and gender roles. == Plot summary == Young Americans is set in the town of New Rawley at a prestigious boarding school, Rawley Academy. Will Krudski, a working class New Englander, earns a scholarship to his hometown's posh boarding school, starting with the summer session, as a means of escaping his abusive father. In a moment of carelessness he confesses to his roommate, Scout, that he cheated on the entrance exam. Their professor, Finn, overhears Will and Scout discussing what to do. Before making a final decision about expelling him, Finn has Will write an essay on who he is. Throughout the series Will continues to face moral dilemmas as he struggles to find his place at school while not alienating his friends in town. There is also the forbidden love of Scout and Bella, who may have the same father. Jacqueline, in an attempt to see if her mother notices her, enrolls at Rawley Academy and presents herself as Jake. Things get complicated when she develops feelings for Hamilton, the dean's son. Hamilton begins to wonder if he is gay as he realizes he has feelings for Jake. The story lines do not converge until the final two episodes of the show as Bella seeks the truth about her biological father. == Cast and characters == === Main characters === * Rodney Scott as William \\"Will\\" Krudski, a poor but brilliant young man who cheated on the entrance exam to ensure his admission and has a complicated relationship to his father. * Mark Famiglietti as Scout Calhoun, Will's roommate at Rawley Academy.

He was a little surprised to see four teenage girls working as pump jockeys. \\"One of them said, 'My dad owns the station.' I just thought this was the sweetest thing I ever saw.\\" The pilot was filmed in Atlanta in 1999 and with a somewhat different cast. The character of Finn was played by Jeremy Sisto in the pilot, but between the pilot and the reshoots for the series, Sisto was cast in the title role of CBS' miniseries Jesus. When the production relocated they also replaced secondary roles, and the only original cast members that remained were the five principal actors. The pilot's soundtrack contained recognizable tracks by Fatboy Slim, New Radicals, and The Flys, but after the reshoots, Antin replaced them with favorites like Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" and Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's \\"Over the Rainbow\\", which at the same time became fashionable in commercials for Volkswagen's Cabrio convertible and eToys.com. A subplot in the pilot involving an affair between Finn and the dean's wife was dropped and later inserted into the third episode of the series. The series was filmed in Havre de Grace, Maryland where a new \\"town square\\", gas station and Friendly's restaurant were built for the production of the show at the intersection of Congress Avenue and North Washington Street. Wilmington and Charlotte, both in North Carolina, had been considered possible filming locations for the series. === Sponsorship === Young Americans promotional poster showing the association with Coca-Cola Young Americans was originally supposed to be a mid-season show in 2000 but was put on hold until Coca-Cola offered to sponsor the show. The character of Will Krudski was then written into Dawson's Creek to associate Young Americans with one of The WB's established shows. When Dawson's Creek went on hiatus in the summer of 2000, Young Americans occupied its timeslot of Wednesdays at 9 P.M. Repeats were shown at 9 P.M. on Fridays. The Coca-Cola Company paid $6 million to be the primary sponsor, the show being billed as \\"Coca-Cola Presents Young Americans\\". Young Americans was profiled by Steve Carell on the August 22, 2000 episode of The Daily Show in the Ad Nauseam segment due to the Coca-Cola tie ins. Carell constantly referred to \\"The Beginning\\" as an \\"hour-long commercial\\". Some of the scenes also took place in a Friendly's restaurant, which was built from an old pizzeria for the show. Coca-Cola products are seen or mentioned in most episodes. The unaired pilot episode does not contain the product placement. Among the changes to the pilot is a scene that was reshot in order to show the characters drinking Coca-Cola. === Promotion === A scene from the pilot, which was heavily promoted prior to the show's premiere, where the characters and other students at Rawley run in slow motion to the school's lake while stripping off their clothes was parodied in another WB show, Grosse Pointe. ==Episodes== The main character, Will Krudski, was introduced late in season three of Dawson's Creek as a childhood friend of the group who has kept in contact with Pacey Witter. Will goes to Capeside to visit with old friends while on spring break. After briefly dating Andie McPhee he returns to Raleigh. ===Unaired pilot episode=== ===Season 1 (2000)=== == Music == The soundtrack features several songs with Nick Drake from his album Pink Moon. *Nick Drake ‚Äì \\"Pink Moon\\" (ep 1.1 and 1.7) *The Getaway People ‚Äì \\"Six Pacs\\" (modified) (ep 1.1 and theme song) *Nick Drake ‚Äì \\"From the Morning\\" (ep 1.1) *Blur ‚Äì \\"Tender\\" (ep 1.1) *Hans Zimmer ‚Äì \\"You're so cool\\" (ep 1.1) *Israel Kamakawiwo'ole ‚Äì \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (ep 1.1 and 1.8) *Crash Poets ‚Äì \\"Goodbye\\" (ep 1.2) *Nick Drake ‚Äì \\"Which Will\\" (ep 1.3) *Kate Bosworth as Bella Banks ‚Äì \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" (ep. 1.4) *Julius La Rosa ‚Äì \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" (ep. 1.4) *David Gray ‚Äì \\"This Years Love\\" (ep. 1.5) *Salt-N-Pepa ‚Äì \\"Let's Talk About Sex\\" (ep. 1.5) *David Gray ‚Äì \\"Sail Away\\" (ep 1.5) *David Gray ‚Äì \\"Please Forgive Me\\" (Album Version) (ep 1.5) *Nick Drake ‚Äì \\"Place to Be\\" (ep 1.7) *Nick Drake ‚Äì \\"Things Behind the Sun\\" (ep 1.7) *Brooke Lundy ‚Äì \\"Fernando\\" (ep 1.8)\\"Soundtracks for 'Young Americans' 'Will Bella Scout Her Mom?'

Harvard creative writing professor Jane Rosenzweig found that Young Americans \\"has a breadth of focus that's far more true to life than the so-called reality-based shows like MTV's Real World and CBS's summer hit Survivor.\\" Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that the show presents as though the creator \\"looked at the blueprints of other WB shows and plucked out the elements that would give his series the best chance for success with the Gen Y set.\\" After naming a checklist of elements of the show that are common to many shows on The WB, Owen says that it is admirable from a business standpoint to make a show in such a manner but that it is not very original. Owen concludes by calling Young Americans \\"mindless and clich√©d\\" but still \\"guilty summer fun.\\" Michele Hewitson of The New Zealand Herald compared the show to the film Dead Poets Society and said that it is not often \\"an American television series manages to exceed all expectations - of utter awfulness.\\" Despite being a spin-off of one of the most popular WB shows, Young Americans received low ratings throughout its summer run and was cancelled in August 2000.

Although a military stalemate, the final settlement favored the Basotho and led to the splitting of Basutoland from the Cape Colony. ==Background== Map of southern Africa, showing Basutoland as a constituent of the Cape Colony (dark pink), before the outbreak of the Basuto Gun War. Basutoland--home of the Basotho people--had been under the nominal control of the Cape Colony (of the British Empire) since 1871 (it was a British protectorate from 1868 until 1871), but the territory remained essentially autonomous in the early years of colonial rule, with traditional Basotho authorities wielding effective power. Only in the late 1870s did Cape authorities attempt to consolidate power over the region and enforce its laws. Basutoland, an independent state until 1868, chafed under the new restrictions and attempts to reduce the authority of its chiefs. Matters came to a head in 1879, when Governor Henry Bartle Frere reserved part of Basutoland for white settlement and demanded that all natives surrender their firearms to Cape authorities under the 1879 Peace Protection Act. ==Outbreak of fighting== The Cape government of Sir John Gordon Sprigg set April 1880 as the date for surrendering weapons. Although some Basotho with great reluctance were willing to surrender their guns, the majority refused; government attempts to enforce the law brought fighting by September. Within months, most Basotho chiefs were in open rebellion. Colonial Cape forces sent to put down the rebellion suffered heavy casualties, as the Basotho had obtained serviceable firearms from the Orange Free State and enjoyed a natural defensive advantage in their country's mountainous terrain. The rebels relied primarily on guerrilla warfare, ambushing isolated units to negate the British/Cape superiority in firepower. In October, Basotho forces ambushed a mounted column of colonial cavalry (1st Regiment, Cape Mounted Yeomanry) at Qalabani near Mafeteng), killing 39. The defeat of an experienced and well- armed cavalry column discouraged Cape authorities. ==Resolution== The costs of the war when added to the earlier war with the Xhosa and renewed troubles in the Transkei were dragging the Cape Colony towards bankruptcy. The war was also becoming increasingly unpopular, and the Sprigg government was replaced by the Thomas Scanlen government. A peace treaty was signed with Basotho chiefs in 1881, in which colonial authorities conceded most of the points in dispute. The land remained in Basotho hands and the nation enjoyed unrestricted access to firearms in exchange for a national one-time indemnity of 5000 cattle. However, unrest continued and it quickly became clear that Cape Town could not control the territory. In 1884, the British government returned the territory to Crown colony status as Basutoland, granting internal self-government in the process. With effective power once again firmly with the chiefs, the conflict subsided. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Wars involving Lesotho Category:Wars involving South Africa Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:Basutoland Category:Military history of South Africa Category:Military history of the British Empire Category:Military history of the Cape Colony Category:1880s in Africa Category:19th-century military history of the United Kingdom Category:Conflicts in 1880 Category:Conflicts in 1881 Category:1880 in Basutoland Category:1881 in Basutoland ","title":"Basuto Gun War"},{"id":"1296084","text":"Cam Lyman, born Camilla Lowell Lyman in Westwood, Massachusetts, was a multimillionaire breeder of champion Clumber spaniels and Bernese mountain dogs who notably died under mysterious circumstances. Lyman's father was Arthur T. Lyman, a prominent Bostonian and scion of the wealthy Lyman family who made their money in the China trade and later in cotton mills and the cotton trade. Lyman was a trans man. The Independent reported that, as a middle-aged adult, Lyman was \\"known to acquaintances as a man\\" and cultivated \\"a male identity\\". Lyman's family members, however, have contended that there is no evidence that Lyman ever received sex reassignment surgery and that he therefore should still be considered a woman. Lyman disappeared in 1987 and was declared dead in 1995. ==Biography== Lyman bred and trained Clumber spaniels and Bernese mountain dogs, and was well known for being talented but rather reclusive. Beginning around 1978, when he moved from the family estate \\"Ricefields\\" on Thacher Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, to a home in Rhode Island, Lyman began to wear men's clothing, cut his hair short, and reportedly took steroids and grew a mustache. By 1985, he had the typical appearance of a male and went by the name Cam. It was during this time that Lyman began to associate with a man named George O'Neil. O'Neil became caretaker of Lyman's estate, and fed, showed, and took care of his dogs. In 1987, Lyman's relatives failed to receive the customary Christmas card from him. They investigated his disappearance and discovered that no one had seen or heard from Lyman in months. Police questioned O'Neil, who claimed that in the summer of 1987, he and Lyman had a fight over the phone about the dogs, and Lyman hung up on him. The next day, O'Neil went over to Lyman's house and found the phone ripped out of the wall and the doors wide open. O'Neil claimed that he believed Lyman had gone to Europe to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. However, O'Neil failed to provide police any proof that Lyman had gone to Europe. O'Neil also failed to explain why he had not informed anyone of Lyman's disappearance for nearly six months. In December 1997, Lyman's body was found in a septic tank on his estate in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, by owners who had recently purchased the house. His final will named the American Kennel Club's Museum of the Dog as the sole beneficiary. The story was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, but as of 2011 no one has ever been charged in the case.TV show yields possible clues in case of the murdered Boston heiress, Boston News, August 9, 1999 AP In 2003, George O'Neil was indicted for embezzling $15,000 from Cam Lyman's estate.

The bands Tarerk, Tessilk, 36.6 and Maximum had strong followings at home. ==History== ===Soviet Era=== Rock was greatly restricted for most of the period Armenia was under Soviet rule, being viewed by the CPSU as a Western anti-socialist influence. Yet, by the early 1970s, there were a range of popular bands in the capital city of Yerevan strong enough to compete with their Soviet counterparts - Arthur Meschian's \\"Arakyalner\\", \\"1+2\\", \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"Bliki\\". By the eighties, combining Armenian folk music with rock, the Armenian folk-rock groups were founded with notable, and popular even in 2000's, representatives - Bambir, founded 1978 in Leninakan and Vostan Hayots, founded in 1986 in Yerevan. In 1982 Bambir won the \\"Folk Music Award\\" at the International Festival in Lida, Belarus. As the Soviet rock scene grew larger in the late 1980s, bands like Asparez and Ayas attracted international audiences due to the new popularity of oriental rock these two bands were among original contributors, that was described first time in Melodie und Rhythmus magazine. Ayas was formed in 1986 by a conservatory graduate Artur Mitinyan, and a year later won Best Song of the Year award at Yerevan's \\"Rock, Rock, Rock Festival\\". Later they won the \\"Sisian Rock Festival\\" award as well. Elips was another important band of the era formed in 1986. In summer 1986 ‚ÄúElips‚Äù went on tour to Latvia, where they played together with a Riga-based group ‚ÄúPilligrim‚Äù. Simultaneously with the fame, the group gained the hatred of the Soviet Communist party nomenclature and was prohibited as an anti-Soviet group. Their most popular song - \\"Patkeratsrek\\" (Imagine) remains as one of the hymns of Armenian rock. ===Post-Soviet Era=== In the early 1990s, an Armenian progressive rock scene developed. Dumbarton Oaks was one of the first bands trying to combine rock with classical music, an example of this is \\"Once Upon a Time There Lived a Cadence\\". The psychedelic side of prog-rock was represented in the much heavier works of MDP. Though only in the 2000s Artsruni and Oaksenham released their albums with the leading French label, Musea,Musea being the pioneers among local bands releasing albums beyond sentimental market. Both bands boast presence of their albums on iTunes and Allmusic.com.Allmusic.com Other popular Armenian rock bands of this era included Breeze, Ambehr,Ambehr The Kings' Cross, Alter Ego, IF by Hayk F. Gyolchanyan, Lav Eli and Empyray. Beerdingungs Lauten was the only representative of grindcore style. Former \\"Lav Eli\\" guitarist Gor MkhitarianOfficial Gor Mkhitarian Web Site. Armenian Singer/Songwriter. Armenian Music. Home. is currently involved with the folk rock scene in the United States regularly releasing his albums there. During the late 1990s increasing popularity of USA based System of a Down, consisted of Armenians, had a considerable impact on popularity of heavier rock in Armenia. Also notable example is Deti Picaso–î–µ—Ç–∏ Picasso, Russian Wikipedia Deti Picasso, Myspace page of a Russia-based folk prog-band consisted of mostly Armenians was noticed and appreciated in Armenia and revived interest towards folk music. In the same early 1990s the Armenian rock bands got to have a fanzine - Mark's Gazette, self-published by Arman Padaryan (aka Mark) for the next 10 years. ===Expatriate Armenian rock=== Expatriate Armenian rock musicians in the US during the 1990s were few, with fewer venues for them to perform. Tigran Mousoian, president of The Armenian Musicians & Artists Center, had organized two festivals in Yerevan, and then planned Armenian Rock Festival in Glendale, California. ==Audience in Armenia== The audience in Armenia remains exceedingly small for local rock groups, playing in local clubs in Yerevan and Gyumri. Although \\"SARD\\", \\"Bambir 2\\", \\"Vordan Karmir\\", \\"Reincarnation\\" and speed-metal band \\"Aramazd\\" started to receive media attention, especially after their videos were televised nationally. \\"Roxygeen\\" was heading the scene of cover-bands, while STRYFE and Sworn are prog-metal bands. The revived MDP and Oaksenham in addition to \\"Bambir 2\\", \\"Blood Covenant\\", STRYFE, Sworn and Empyray led the vanguard of quality made native rock in the new millennium. Arthur Meschian had sold-out concerts in Yerevan Opera Theatre and Complex Sports and Concerts Complex. Also the most popular Alternative Rock band in the world from Armenia is The Beautified Project. The band has played concerts in Armenia, UK, Austria, Germany, France, Russia and Georgia.armenpress.am: The Beautified Project ==Music Awards== Since 2004 International Armenian Music AwardArmenian Music Award announces winners in various rock categories. Among laureates and nominees there were Bambir 2, Empyray, Oaksenham, Hexen, Gor Mkhitaryan, Red Snow (band)Red Snow and others. In 2009 Lebanese Armenian, Eileen Khatchadourian's album MidanMidan received the award of the Best Rock Album of the year. Another ceremony is Armenia's National Music AwardsNational Music Awards showcase of the Armenian Television 1st Channel,Armenian Television 1st Channel which claims best performers of the year in Armenia. At the 6th ceremony, which took place on March 27, 2010 the best rock group was announced Dorians, a group featuring a singer Gor Sujyan. Unfortunately both awards has not gained authority, and are often boycotted by more intransigent Armenian rock musicians. ==Rock Festivals== In the late 1990s and early 2000s, festivals organized by the ACCEA (Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art) signaled a rebirth of the Armenian rock music scene, with many new bands and musicians coming from the heartland region of Vanadzor. Among the most popular bands at that time there were \\"Vostan Hayots\\", \\"Angels\\", and punk rockers \\"Ass Kissers\\". There was a splash of interest in very heavy acts such as \\"Beerdigungs L√§uten\\" playing quality grindcore metal. In September 2007 Rock4Peace festival concerts organized with participation of Germans from Kultur Aktiv e.V. and Vibrographus were held in Yerevan, Gyumri and Stepanakert. The reunion of Ayas took place after the meeting of the band's core musicians in Moscow, whilst Vostan Hayots continued irregularly appear with club concerts in Yerevan. Armenian rock started to live another wave of revival and yet local rock music does not have an industrial sense, though Armenian rock musicians started to participate in the commercially and politically biased projects such as two \\"Rock-and-Dram\\" festivals were held, on April 13 and November 23, 2007. Tigran Mousoian, president of The Armenian Musicians & Artists Center, organized two festivals in Yerevan, and planned Armenian Rock Festival in Glendale, California. Also in early 2006, Armenian-American band System Of A Down's song B.Y.O.B. won a grammy for best hard rock song. ==Concerts by outside groups== A range of top- class concerts featuring legendary rock groups has been organized in Armenia by Vibrgraphus in 2009 and 2010 including visits of Jethro Tull, Uriah Heep, John McLaughlin and Deep Purple. ==Other activity== Harutyun Ayvazyan (Artyom) was the first Armenian journalist, who published a rock encyclopedia in St. Petersburg in Russian language at Avgust Publishing House. ==References== Category:Armenian music Category:Armenian rock music Category:Music scenes Category:Rock music genres ","title":"Armenian rock"},{"id":"1296097","text":"Oleni () is a village and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece.

The Secretum or Secreta Secretorum (Latin for , also known as the (), is a pseudoaristotelian treatise which purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student Alexander the Great on an encyclopedic range of topics, including statecraft, ethics, physiognomy, astrology, alchemy, magic, and medicine. The earliest extant editions claim to be based on a 9th-century Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of the lost Greek original. Modern scholarship finds it likely to have been a 10th-century work composed in Arabic. Translated into Latin in the mid-12th century, it was influential among European intellectuals during the High Middle Ages. ==Origin== The origin of the treatise remains uncertain. The Arabic edition claims to be a translation from Greek by 9th-century scholar Abu Yahya ibn al-Batriq (died 815 CE), and one of the main translators of Greek-language philosophical works for Al-Ma'mun, working from a Syriac edition which was itself translated from a Greek original. It contains supposed letters from Aristotle to his pupil Alexander the Great. No such texts have been discovered and it appears the work was actually composed in Arabic. The letters may thus derive from the Islamic and Persian legends surrounding Alexander. The Arabic treatise is preserved in two copies: a longer 10-book version and a shorter version of 7 or 8 books; the latter is preserved in about 50 copies. Modern scholarship considers that the text must date to after the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity and before the work of Ibn Juljul in the late 10th century. The section on physiognomy may have been circulating as early as 940\\\\. The Arabic version was translated into Persian (at least twice), Ottoman Turkish (twice), Hebrew, Spanish, and twice into Latin. (The Hebrew edition was also the basis for a translation into Russian.) The first Latin translation was done for the Portuguese queen by the converso John of Seville; it is now preserved in about 150 copies. The second translation was done at Antioch by Philip of Tripoli; it is preserved in more than 350 copies. Some 13th-century editions include additional sections. ==Contents== The Secretum Secretorum claims to be a treatise written by Aristotle to Alexander during his conquest of Achaemenid Persia. Its topics range from ethical questions that face a ruler to astrology to the medical and magical properties of plants, gems, and numbers to an account of a unified science which is accessible only to a scholar with the proper moral and intellectual background. Copland's English translation is divided into sections on the work's introduction, the Manner of Kings, Health, the Four Seasons of the Year, Natural Heat, Food, Justice, Physiognomy, and Comportment. The enlarged 13th-century edition includes alchemical references and an early version of the Emerald Tablet. ==Legacy== It was one of the most widely read texts of the High Middle Ages or even the most-read. ªAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn Badawƒ´ (1987), La transmission de la philosophie grecque au monde arabe, Paris, Librairie Philosophique Vrin, p. 11 Amid the 12th-century Renaissance's Recovery of Aristotle, medieval readers took the ascription to Aristotle at face value and treated this work among Aristotle's genuine works. It is particularly connected with the 13th-century English scholar Roger Bacon, who cited it more often than his contemporaries and even produced an edited manuscript with his own introduction and notes, an unusual honor. This led mid-20th century scholars like Steele to claim that Bacon's contact with the Secretum Secretorum was the key event pushing him towards experimental science; more recent scholarship is less sweeping in its claims but still accords it an important place in research of his later works. The Latin Secretum Secretorum was eventually translated into Czech, Russian, Croatian, Dutch, German, Icelandic, English, Aragonese, Vicente de Vera, Eduardo: El aragon√©s: Historiograf√≠a y Literatura, Zaragoza, Mira editores, 1992. p 83 Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Welsh.Kyfrinach y Kyfrinachoedd, The 1528 English translation by Robert Copland was based on Philip of Tripoli's Latin edition. Scholarly attention to the Secretum Secretorum waned around 1550 but lay interest has continued to this day among students of the occult. Scholars today see it as a window onto medieval intellectual life: it was used in a variety of scholarly contexts and had some part to play in the scholarly controversies of the day. ==The Book of Secrets== There is another book called The Book of Secrets (; ) by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, which appeared in Europe around the same time and has been often confused with the Secretum Secretorum. It deals more specifically with alchemy, providing practical recipes, classification of minerals, and descriptions of laboratory equipment and procedures. ==The Book on Physiognomy== There is a third book called The Book on Physiognomy () which was also attributed to Aristotle and claimed to have been translated into Arabic by Hunayn ibn Ishaq in the 9th century. ==Notes== ==References== :This article incorporates text derived from NLM Microfilm Reel: FILM 48-123 no. 4; online version. * Regula Forster, Das Geheimnis der Geheimnisse: die arabischen und deutschen Fassungen des pseudo-aristotelischen Sirr al-asrar / Secretum Secretorum, Wiesbaden, Reichert, 2006, . * Mahmoud Manzalaoui, \\"The pseudo-Aristotelian Kitab Sirr al-asrar: facts and problems\\", Oriens, vol. 23-24 (1974), pp. 146‚Äì257. * Steven J.

His death was one of those classed as a homicide, though the initial military statement described his death as due to natural causes. Habibullah's brother was a Taliban leader. Carlotta Gall, the New York Times reporter in Afghanistan, was the first to discover the story in 2003. Captain Carolyn Wood, commander of Alpha Company of the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion, and Captain Christopher Beiring, commander of the 377th Military Police Company, directed their troops at the Bagram Collection Point to confine their captives with their arms handcuffed above their heads in order to deprive them of sleep. Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill was later quoted in the press denying that Bagram prisoners had been chained to the ceiling or held in chains attached to the ceiling. Their troops routinely kneed their captives in the side of their thighs. They called these \\"compliance blows\\". During a Criminal Investigation Division inquiry their troops claimed they had been told‚Äîincorrectly‚Äîthat this kind of blow was a legal, authorized use of force. ==Causes of death== Habibullah's autopsy was performed two days after his death, and classed his death as a homicide. Dr. Ingwerson said the cause of death was \\"Pulmonary embolism due to blunt force injury to the legs.\\" But this did not prevent the GIs staffing the prison from continuing to use these \\"compliance blows\\", and a second Afghan, Dilawar, died four days later, on December 10, 2002, under practically identical circumstances. Dr. Elizabeth Rouse, the coroner for Dilawar, the other murder victim, said she had seen similar damage to a man whose legs had been run over by a bus. ==Prosecutions== By 2005, at least 15 American soldiers had been recommended for prosecution by Army investigators for abuse of detainees at Bagram. At least five of the soldiers were charged with crimes involving Habibullah's treatment. Captain Christopher Beiring was charged with dereliction of duty and making false statements; the charges were dropped, but he was reprimanded. Sgt. Christopher Greatorex was tried on charges of abuse, maltreatment, and making false statements; he was acquitted on September 7, 2005. Sgt.

A native of New York City, Ginter accumulated a considerable fortune throughout his numerous business ventures and became one of Richmond's wealthiest citizens despite his exceptionally modest demeanor.\\"Lewis Ginter.\\" \\"The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography\\" 5, 348. While the Jefferson Hotel, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, and Ginter Park embody some of Ginter's major urban contributions to Richmond, many of his philanthropic gifts were given anonymously to charitable organizations and individuals in need.Burns, 178. His continued devotion to Richmond is captured in his famous remark, \\"I am for Richmond, first and last.\\"Burns, 284. ==Early life== Lewis Ginter was born to John and Elizabeth Ginter, a Dutch immigrant couple, on April 24, 1824 in New York City. His father owned a grocery store, but died soon after Ginter was born. Several years later, Ginter's mother died, leaving him to be raised by his older sister and brother with their relatives.Ryan and Wayland, 3. ==Richmond== ===Early business=== In 1842, at the age of eighteen, Ginter relocated to Richmond, Virginia to open up a shop selling toys. He had visited the city at least once before with an uncle. Ginter soon moved from selling toys to merchandising fine linens, and encountered great success. By 1856, he formed a partnership with his nephew, George Arents, and John F. Alvey to begin marketing wholesale linens. Ginter traveled throughout the United States and Europe in search of high quality linens and amassed a considerable fortune before the beginning of the American Civil War. Preparing for unpredictable times, Ginter invested in large quantities of tobacco, sugar, and cotton that were stored in Richmond warehouses in order to protect his wealth.North, http://www.lewisginter.org/about/history/lewis_ginter_history.php. ===Military office=== Although he was originally from the North, Ginter supported his adopted home in the Confederacy by buying Confederate bonds and waiving outstanding debts. In 1861, he joined the Confederate Army and received praise from his superiors for his heroic and logical behavior on several occasions, which earned him the nickname \\"The Fighting Commissary.\\" Ginter eventually rose to the rank of Major under Generals Joseph R. Anderson and A.P. Hill, and retained this title from affectionate Southerners long after the war ended.Ryan and Wayland, 5. Ginter was present during Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, and returned to Richmond several days later.Burns, 69. ==New York== Upon his return to Richmond, Ginter found the city in a state of total disrepair. His warehouse stores of tobacco and sugar were destroyed during a citywide fire, though his cotton remained unscathed. With little economic opportunity in Richmond, Ginter decided to return to New York City to pursue a career in banking. He joined the firm Harrison, Goddin, & Apperson and experienced great financial success. But his regained fortune was short- lived. The Panic of 1873 forced Ginter to use his personal fortune to settle heavy debts his firm incurred. Having lost all of his wealth once again, Ginter decided to return to Richmond. ==Return to Richmond== ===Tobacco=== In 1873, Ginter joined John F. Allen to form Allen & Ginter, a partnership selling foreign made tobacco. Shortly after, Ginter thought of manufacturing Virginia made cigarettes to compete with foreign products, and Allen & Ginter released their first line of domestic cigarettes as the \\"Richmond Gems\\" in 1875.Ryan and Wayland, 6. Early production began in a factory with twenty young ladies who hand-rolled the cigarettes. The domestic cigarettes enjoyed phenomenal success, and Ginter began designs for more brands. Allen & Ginter soon released \\"Perfection,\\" \\"Napoleon,\\" \\"Virginia Pets,\\" and \\"Old Dominion.\\" By 1888, the company employed over 1,000 workers and cigarette production increased from 100,000 per month to 2,000,000 per day. Allen & Ginter eventually opened offices in London, Paris, and Berlin in order to meet foreign demand for their products. With growing competition in the tobacco industry, Ginter commissioned custom designed cigarette machine rollers. Allen & Ginter continued to prosper until they merged with J. B. Duke, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin & Company to form the American Tobacco Company in 1890. Ginter was offered presidency, but declined and remained a director until his death.Ryan and Wayland, 7. ===Real estate=== Although Ginter had lived in Richmond for several decades, he did not purchase his first home until 1886. He invited his sister, Jane Arents, and her four children, George, Grace Evelyn, Joanna, and Minnie, to live with him at 405 East Cary Street. In 1888, he built a Late-Victorian three-story house at 901 West Franklin Street, currently known as the Ginter House. This construction sparked a trend as many elegant, new homes soon popped up along Franklin Street. Ginter was inspired by the suburban developments in Melbourne and Sydney that he visited on one of many business trips marketing for Allen & Ginter. Beginning in 1888, Ginter and John Pope began purchasing large tracts of land on the northern side of Richmond in Henrico County with the intention of developing suburbs. Their purchases included Westbrook Plantation, which they developed into a grand country estate. The Westbrook house included a private barbershop and one-lane bowling alley.\\"Ryan and Wayland, 12. Ginter and Pope divided the large swaths of land into residential plots and provided many extravagant amenities, such as fresh artesian wells, tile sewer lines, roads covered with crushed stone, and the extension of the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, the nation's first electric tram system. The neighborhood, known as Ginter Park, attracted the Union Theological Seminary and was eventually annexed to the City of Richmond.\\"History.\\" \\"Ginter Park Residents Association\\". http://www.ginterpark.org/ginter-park-history.php. Ginter also had a hand in developing several nearby neighborhoods. He established the Lakeside Wheel Club in 1894, and built a nine-hole golf course and a small zoo. Always eager to improve Richmond, Ginter hired architects Carrere and Hastings in 1892 to design a world-class hotel known as the Jefferson. An estimated 5-10 million dollars were invested in the realization of the hotel before it opened on October 31, 1895.Ryan and Wayland, 14. Upon opening, it was immediately praised as one of the finest hotels in the country. Ginter commissioned Edward V. Valentine to create a life-size sculpture of Thomas Jefferson from Carrara marble to be displayed as the centerpiece of the upper lobby. Additional novelties included exotic palm trees from Central and South America, numerous antiques, Turkish and Russian baths, electric elevators, and for a brief period, alligators in the outdoor fountain.\\"History.\\" \\"The Jefferson\\". http://www.jeffersonhotel.com/experience/history. Not only did the Jefferson become an icon of Ginter's immeasurable dedication to his adopted city, it symbolized Richmond's growing post-war prosperity. == John Pope == While working as a banker in New York City, Ginter met John Pope, a young messenger boy who delivered packages to Ginter's firm.\\"John Pope.\\" \\"The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography\\" 4, 320. Pope was born in New York City in 1856 to a German immigrant family. His father was a shoemaker, and Pope acquired the delivery job at the age of 14 to help his family make ends meet. Ginter recruited Pope to join his newly formed tobacco company, Allen & Ginter.Burns, 84. Shortly thereafter, Ginter relocated back to Richmond, and brought Pope along with him. The two began an enduring partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives. Pope quickly became Ginter's trusted business partner and assumed a number of executive roles, including Vice President of Allen & Ginter in 1888, and President of the Crystal Ice Company, James River Marl and Bone Phosphate Company, and Powhatan Clay Manufacturing Company. Like Ginter, Pope was involved in a number of philanthropic activities, and strove to avoid the public eye.\\"John Pope.\\" \\"The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography\\" 4, 320-321. Ginter and Pope remained lifelong bachelors and lived together until Pope's death in 1896.Marschak and Lorch, 12.Burns, 132. Pope was buried in a plot in Hollywood Cemetery that Ginter had reserved for himself.Burns, 183. While their relationship was never explicitly romantic, Ginter reportedly \\"never sought the company of women.\\"Richmond Dispatch. Oct. 3, 1897. ==Death== Lewis Ginter's grave at Hollywood Cemetery The death of Ginter's close companion John Pope left him noticeably distraught. Ginter also suffered from diabetes, and his health quickly declined before being bedridden at his Westbrook estate. After two months of severe debilitation, Ginter died on October 2, 1897. His funeral was regarded as one of the largest in Richmond's history, and he remains interred in a private mausoleum in Hollywood Cemetery, overlooking the James River.Ryan and Wayland, 17.Burns, 189. ==Legacy== At the time of his death, Ginter had amassed one of the largest personal fortunes in the South.\\"Lewis Ginter.\\" \\"The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography\\" 5, 348-349. His enduring commitment to Richmond is evidenced in his significant investments in real estate, business, and most notably, his philanthropic activity. Even while Ginter was traveling abroad, he reportedly ordered items from Richmond to support local merchants.Ryan and Wayland, 8. His will included gifts to almost every charity and public institution in the city. The remainder of his wealth was left to his relatives, including his niece, Grace Arents, who continued in her uncle's charitable footsteps. Arents adapted the Lakeside Wheel Club into a progressive farm that was known as Bloemendaal, which she later set up to become Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. She also developed St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, St. Andrew's School, built playgrounds, and funded numerous schools and medical institutions.Bryan, 198. In 1897, the Richmond Dispatch praised him as \\"one whose public spirit and broad charity have made his name familiar and honored throughout this city, which he loved so well, did so much to build up and beautify.\\" ==Notes== ==References== *Burns, Bryan. \\"Lewis Ginter: Richmond's Gilded Age icon\\".

G.J. Flach studied classics and law at Strasbourg, and in 1869 took his degree of doctor of law. In his theses as well as in his early writings such as De la subrogation r√©elle, La Bonorum possessio, and Sur la dur√©e des effets de la minorit√© (1870) he endeavored to explain the problems of laws by means of history, an idea which was new to France at that time. The Franco-Prussian War engaged Flach's activities in other directions, and he spent two years (described in his Strasbourg apr√®s le bombardment, 1873) at work on the rebuilding of the library and the museum, which had been destroyed by Prussian shells. When the time came for him to choose between Germany and France, he settled definitely in Paris, where he completed his scientific training at the √âcole des Chartes and the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes. Having acted for some time as secretary to Jules S√©nard, ex- president of the Constituent Assembly, he published an original paper on artistic copyright, but as soon as possible resumed the history of law. In 1879 he became assistant to the jurist √âdouard Ren√© de Laboulaye at the Coll√®ge de France, and succeeded him in 1884 in the chair of comparative legislation. Since 1877 he had been professor of comparative law at the free school of the political sciences. To qualify himself for these two positions he had to study the most diverse civilizations, including those of the East and Far East (e.g. Hungary, Russia and Japan) and even the antiquities of Babylonia and other Asiatic countries. Some of his lectures have been published, particularly those concerning Ireland: Histoire du r√©gime agraire de l'Irlande (1883); Consid√©rations sur l'histoire politique de l'Irlande (1885); and Jonathan Swift, son action politique en Irlande (1886). His chief efforts, however, were concentrated on the history of ancient French law. A celebrated lawsuit in Alsace, pleaded by his friend and compatriot Ignace Chauffour, aroused his interest by reviving the question of the origin of the feudal laws, and gradually led him to study the formation of those laws and the early growth of the feudal system. His great work, Les Origines de l'ancienne France, was produced slowly. In the first volume, Le R√©gime seigneurial (1886), he depicts the triumph of individualism and anarchy, showing how, after Charlemagne's great but sterile efforts to restore the Roman principle of sovereignty, the great landowners gradually monopolized the various functions in the state; how society modelled on antiquity disappeared; and how the only living organisms were vassalage and clientship. The second volume, Les Origines communales, et f√©odalit√© et la chevalerie (1893), deals with the reconstruction of society on new bases which took place in the 10th and 11th centuries. It explains how the Gallo-Roman villa gave place to the village, with its fortified castle, the residence of the lord; how new towns were formed by the side of old, some of which disappeared; how the townspeople united in corporations; and how the communal bond proved to be a powerful instrument of cohesion. At the same time it traces the birth of feudalism from the germs of the Gallo-Roman personal comitalus; and shows how the bond that united the different parties was the contract of the fief; and how, after a slow growth of three centuries, feudalism was definitely organized in the 12th century. In 1904 appeared the third volume, La Renaissance de l'√âtat, in which the author describes the efforts of the Direct Capetian kings to reconstruct the power of the Frankish kings over the whole of Gaul; and goes on to show how the clergy, the heirs of the imperial tradition, encouraged this ambition; how the great lords of the kingdom (the \\"princes\\", as Flach calls them), whether as allies or foes, pursued the same end; and how, before the close of the 12th century, the Capetian kings were in possession of the organs and the means of action which were to render them so powerful and bring about the early downfall of feudalism. In these three volumes, which appeared at long intervals, the author's theories are not always in complete harmony, nor are they always presented in a very luminous or coherent manner, but they are marked by originality and vigour. Flach gave them a solid basis by the wide range of his researches, utilizing charters and cartularies (published and unpublished), chronicles, lives of saints, and even those dangerous guides, the chansons de geste. He owed little to the historians of feudalism, who knew what feudalism was, but not how it came about. He pursued the same method in his L'Origine de l'habitation et des lieux habit√©s en France (1899), in which he discusses some of the theories circulated by A Meitzen in Germany and by Arbois de Jubainville in France. Following in the footsteps of the jurist F. K. von Savigny, Flach studied the teaching of law in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and produced Cujas les glossateurs et les Bartolistes (1883), and √âtudes critiques sur l'histoire du droit romain au moyen √¢ge, avec textes in√©dits (1890). Flach's library was purchased by the University of Missouri in 1920 and is preserved at the University of Missouri Libraries. == References == * == External Links == *Jacques Flach Collection at the University of Missouri Libraries Category:1846 births Category:1919 deaths Category:French historians Category:French jurists Category:Coll√®ge de France faculty Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:19th-century jurists Category:20th-century jurists ","title":"Geoffroi Jacques Flach"},{"id":"1296264","text":"Muhu (also called Muhumaa in Estonian), is an island in the West Estonian archipelago of the Baltic Sea. With an area of it is the third largest island belonging to Estonia, after Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. Together with neighbouring smaller islands of Kesselaid, Viirelaid, V√µilaid and Suurlaid it forms Muhu Parish (), the rural municipality within Saare County. The municipality has a population of 1,697 (as of 19 April 2010) and covers an area of . The population density is . ==History and geography== The German names for the island are Mohn and Moon. Moon is also the Swedish name for the island. The most important villages in Muhu are Kuivastu, Liiva (where the school can be found) and Koguva. In P√§daste, an internationally renowned luxury hotel and spa operates in the restored manor house. The island is divided from mainland Estonia by the Suur Strait (Moonsund) and from Saaremaa by the V√§ike Strait. It is linked by ferry to Virtsu in the mainland, and to Saaremaa by a causeway, the V√§inatamm. In winter an ice road connects the island to the mainland. In January 1227, an army of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword with Letts, Germans of Riga and native Livonians (20,000 men commanded by William of Modena) crossed on sea ice from the mainland and attacked the island of Saaremaa to reduce the last holdout of pagan Estonians. The Estonians surrendered on Muhu at a circular stronghold called Mona, the earthworks of which are still preserved near the causeway between the islands. This ended the Estonian Crusade. The Battle of Karuse or Battle on the Ice was fought on 16 February 1270 between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Livonian Order on the frozen Baltic Sea between the Muhu Island and the mainland. The Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory. The battle, named after the Karuse village, was the fifth-largest defeat of the Livonian or Teutonic Orders in the 13th century. The same waters saw the Battle of Moon Sound in September‚ÄìOctober 1917 between Russian and German naval forces.

She is best known for her performances and recordings of a number of violin concerti, compositions by J.S. Bach, and her innovative interpretations of popular and jazz compositions by Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, The Beatles, and others. ==Biography and early career== Mullova was born in Zhukovsky, 45 km far from Moscow, in Soviet Russia. At the age of 4, she was encouraged to start her violin training by her father Yuri Mullov, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute physicist and engineer. After studying at the and at the Moscow Conservatory under Leonid Kogan, she won first prize at the 1980 International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition in Helsinki and the Gold Medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982. She remembered the whole experience of the Soviet quasi-religious state-sponsored musical education as an overly stressful nightmare full of hypocrisy: \\"Naturally, I have never believed in communism. But everything was a play. I knew I wanted to leave, and I was pretending to be a naive girl\\". ==Defection== During a tour of Finland in 1983, Mullova and her lover, Vakhtang Jordania, who posed as her accompanist so they could defect together, left the hotel in Kuusamo, after Jordania told the KGB officer who was watching them that Mullova was too sick from drinking to attend the afterparty. The Stradivari violin owned by the Soviet Union was left behind on the hotel bed. A YLE journalist Jyrki Koulumies, accompanied by a photographer Caj Sundman, drove them in a rented car across the border via Haparanda to Lule√•, Sweden where they flew to Stockholm. At that time, the Swedish police treated the young, on-the-run musicians just like any other political defectors from the Eastern Bloc: they suggested that the couple stay in a safehouse over the weekend until the American Embassy opened so they could apply for political asylum upon relocation. So for two days they sat under pseudonyms in a safehouse not even daring to go outside, because their photographs were on the front page of every Swedish and international newspaper. Two days later they arrived in Washington, D.C. with American visas in their pockets. ==Life in the West== Mullova has made many recordings including her debut release of the Tchaikovsky and Jean Sibelius violin concertos which was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque. She formed the Mullova Chamber Ensemble in the mid-1990s. The ensemble has toured Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and has recorded the Bach violin concertos on Philips Classics. She was nominated for a 1995 Grammy Award for her recording of the Bach Partitas, and she won a 1995 Echo Klassik award, a Japanese Record Academy Award and a Deutsche Schallplattenkritik prize for her recording of the Brahms violin concerto. Her recording of the Brahms B major Trio (no. 1) and Beethoven's Archduke Trio with Andr√© Previn and Heinrich Schiff was released in 1995, receiving a further Diapason d'Or. Mullova's international career as a soloist has included performances with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Allen & Ginter created and marketed the first cigarette cards for collecting and trading in the United States. Some of the notable cards in the series include baseball players Charles Comiskey, Cap Anson, and Jack Glasscock, as well as non-athletes like Buffalo Bill Cody. The company merged with four other tobacco manufacturers to form the American Tobacco Company in 1890. Since 2006, a revived version of the brand has been issued by Topps for a line of baseball cards. ==History== ===Tobacco manufacturing=== Engraving of the Allen & Ginter warehouses in Richmond, Virginia, from an 1886 promotional book Virginia Brights cigarette box by Allen & Ginter, c. 1888 The firm of Allen & Ginter was founded in 1865. In 1882 Allen retired, leaving Ginter, who retained the firm name despite taking on one John Pope as new partner. The first tobacco company to employ female labor, by 1886 they had 1,100 employees, predominantly girls, who rolled the cigarettes. The company offered a prize for the invention of a machine able to roll cigarettes (which until then had been hand-rolled). James Albert Bonsack won this prize with his 1880/81 invention. Because it was not completely reliable, all but one of the large tobacco manufacturers declined to buy the machine. James Buchanan Duke did buy this cigarette rolling machine in 1885 and used it to great success; by 1890 he had consolidated his four major competitors, including Allen & Ginter, and formed the American Tobacco Company.Pritcher, Lynn. \\"More About Tobacco Advertising and the Tobacco Collections.\\" Duke University Libraries. 24 January 2008. 10 April 2008. The \\"Allen & Ginter Company\\" was no more, but Lewis Ginter sat on the board of the American Tobacco Company. The cigarette brands of Allen & Ginter included Richmond Gems, Virginia Brights, Perfection, Dandies and Little Beauties. In 1890, Allen & Ginter, along with other companies of the United States (W. Duke & Sons, W.S. Kimball & Company, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin & Company) formed the American Tobacco Company, in an attempt to compete against British tobacco companies. ===Collectible cards=== In late 1880s, Allen & Ginter began to release cigarette card sets as promotional items for its cigarette brands. Most part of the collection consisting of illustrated cards with a few collections of photographs. Topics varied from birds and wild animals to American Indian chiefs or flags of the world. Allen & Ginter's baseball cards were the first of the tobacco era baseball cards ever produced for distribution on a national level.Allen & Ginter Tobacco Cards (Archive, 27 Jul 2009) The most popular and highly sought after of these sets is the N28 and N29 \\"World's Champions\\" series, released in 1887.1887 N28 Allen & Ginter Baseball Cards on The Cardboard Connection ===Modern era=== In 2006, Topps, a leading producer of confectionery and trading cards, resurrected the Allen & Ginter brand name to produce a series of illustrated trading cards, mostly focused on baseball sets. Nevertheless, the first couple of years of the product's inception saw the inclusion of several other sports figures such as Jennie Finch (softball), Brandi Chastain and Mia Hamm (soccer), Hulk Hogan (wrestling), Danica Patrick (auto racing), Leon Spinks (boxing), Randy Couture (mixed martial arts), Misty May-Treanor (beach volleyball) and Dennis Rodman (basketball). Allen & Ginter cards began to feature hand-painted cards of current baseball players as well as various insert sets featuring standout athletes in other sports, pop culture icons, and historical figures ranging from Wee-Man to Davy Crockett and everything in between. Non-sports trading cards issued by Topps included personalities such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas Edison, Billy the Kid and Andrew Carnegie, Davy Crockett, among others. From 2006 to 2009, artist Dick Perez was commissioned to hand paint special one of one insert cards in the style of Allen & Ginter. Perez created 30 art cards each of those years featuring the prominent stars of the game. As of 2012 the Allen & Ginter series remains one of Topps' most popular, highest selling brands in their product lineup. The best known of the Allen & Ginter insert sets however, are the DNA Hair Relic cards. These highly lauded cards feature strands of hair from famous historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, King George III, George Washington and many others. Another popular feature of the Allen & Ginter product is the Rip Card. Invented by hobby shop owner and Topps consultant Alan Narz,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080202947A1/en Rip Cards have been a part of every Allen & Ginter product since 2006. These cards allow collectors to keep the card intact or to rip the outer card to reveal an exclusive mini card available only inside of a Rip Card. These mini cards may be short prints, autographs, or cards made from metal or wood. Beginning in 2013, Topps began including a Double Rip Card, which had two inner cavities with mini cards inside. In 2019, Topps introduced a jumbo Box Topper Rip Card, with 3 mini cards inside. ==Trading cards series== There were various cigarette card sets released as promotional items for these products.

Torpex comprises 42% RDX, 40% TNT and 18% powdered aluminium. It was used in the Second World War from late 1942, at which time some used the names Torpex and RDX interchangeably, much to the confusion of today's historical researchers. The name is short for torpedo explosive. Torpex proved to be particularly useful in underwater munitions because the aluminium component had the effect of making the explosive pulse last longer, which increased the destructive power. Besides torpedoes and depth charges, Torpex was only used in the Upkeep, Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs as well as the drones employed in Operation Aphrodite. Torpex has long been superseded by H6 and Polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) compositions. It is therefore regarded as obsolete and Torpex is unlikely to be encountered except in old munitions or unexploded ordnance, although a notable exception to this is the Sting Ray lightweight torpedo, which as of October 2020 remains in service with the Royal Navy and several foreign militaries. The German equivalent of Torpex was Trialen. ==Development== Torpex was developed at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey, in the United Kingdom as a more powerful military alternative to TNT. RDX was developed in 1899. Though very stable and serving as the reference point by which the sensitivity of other explosives are judged, it was too expensive for most military applications and reserved for use in the most important products, such as torpedoes. Aluminium powder was also added to the mix to further enhance the effect. Although both RDX and TNT have a negative oxygen balance, the superheated aluminium component tends to contribute primarily by extending the expansion time of the explosive product gases. Beeswax was also added as a phlegmatizing agent, to reduce sensitivity to shock and impact. Later, beeswax was replaced with paraffin wax, and calcium chloride was added as a moisture absorber to reduce the production of hydrogen gas under high humidity. ==See also== * Trialen * Amatol * Composition H6 * Hexanite * List of explosives used during World War II * Minol * Tritonal ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:British inventions Category:Explosives ","title":"Torpex"},{"id":"1296329","text":"==Events== ===January events=== * January ‚Äì First section of the Mexican Southern Railroad opens, from Puebla to Tehuac√°n. * January 28 ‚Äì The railway trades unions of the United Kingdom put out demands for shorter working hours under threat of national strike action. ===February events=== * February 9 ‚Äì A first section of Naples-Samo Commuter Railroad Line, as predecessor for Circumvesuviana Samo Line, Naples to San Giuseppe Vesuviano route officially completed, and regular operation service to start in Campania Region, Italy.:it:Ferrovia Naples-Ottaviano-Samo#Storia(Italian language) Retrieved January 10, 2017 ===April events=== * April 19 ‚Äì A fatal collision in Kipton, Ohio between a freight train and a passenger train, attributed to a faulty engineer's pocket watch which stopped for 4 minutes.

Having served in the Prussian army as a volunteer in 1815, he shortly afterwards entered the University of Breslau as a student of law; but, attracted by the stage, he soon forsook academic life and made his debut in the Breslau theatre as Mortimer in Schiller's Maria Stuart. He led a wandering life for the next two years, appearing less on the stage as an actor than as a reciter of his own poems. In 1821 he married the actress Luise Roge (1800-1825), and was appointed theatre-poet to the Breslau stage. He next removed to Berlin, where his wife fulfilled an engagement at the Court theatre. During his sojourn here he produced the vaudevilles Die Wiener in Berlin (1824), and Die Berliner in Wien (1825), pieces which enjoyed at the time great popular favour. In 1825 his wife died; but soon after her death he accepted an engagement at the K√∂nigsst√§dter theatre in Berlin, when he wrote a number of plays, notably Lenore (1828),Published 1829 based on Gottfried August B√ºrger's ballad, and Der alte Feldherr (1825).EEVA In 1830 he married Julie Holzbecher (1809-1839), an actress engaged at the same theatre, and with her played in Darmstadt. Returning to Berlin in 1831 he wrote for the composer Franz Gl√§ser (1798-1861) the text of the opera Des Adlers Horst (1832), and for Ludwig Devrient the drama, Der dumme Peter (1837). In 1833 Holtei again went on the stage and toured with his wife to various important cities, Hamburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Munich and Vienna. In the last his declamatory powers as a reciter, particularly of Shakespeare's plays, made a furore, and the poet-actor was given the appointment of manager of the Josefst√§dter theatre in the last-named city. Though proud of his successes both as actor and reciter, Holtei left Vienna in 1836, and from 1837 to 1839 conducted the theatre in Riga. Here his second wife died, and after wandering through Germany reciting and accepting a short engagement at Breslau, he settled in 1847 at Graz, where he devoted himself to a literary life and produced the novels Die Vagabunden (1851), Christian Lammfell (1853) and Der letzte Kom√∂diant (1863). The last years of his life were spent at Breslau, where being in poor circumstances he found a home in the Kloster der Barmherzigen Br√ºder, and here he died. Memorial plaque in Breslau As a dramatist Holtei may be said to have introduced the vaudeville into Germany; as an actor, although remaining behind the greater artists of his time, he contrived to fascinate his audience by the dramatic force of his exposition of character as a reciter, especially of Shakespeare, he knew no rival. August Lewald said of Holtei that by the energy of his poetic conception and plastic force he brought his audience round to his own ideas; and he added, \\"an eloquence such as his I have never met with in any other German.\\" Holtei was not only a stage-poet but, a lyric-writer of great charm. Notable among such productions are Schlesische Gedichte (1830; 20th ed., 1893), Gedichte (5th ed., 1861), Stimmen des Waldes (2nd ed., 1854). Mention ought also to be made of Holtei's interesting autobiography, Vierzig Jahre (8 vols., 1843-1850; 3rd ed., 1862) with the supplementary volume Noch ein Jahr in Schlesien (1864).

It was originally recorded by The Platters with lead vocals by Tony Williams in 1955. ==The Platters version== The Platters first recorded the song for Federal Records on May 20, 1954, but the recording was not released. In 1955, after moving to Mercury Records, the band re-recorded the song (on April 26) and it scored a major hit when it was released in May. In November that year, Federal Records released the original recording as a single (B-side - \\"You Made Me Cry\\") which sold poorly. Platters bass singer Herb Reed later recalled how the group hit upon its successful version: \\"We tried it so many times, and it was terrible. One time we were rehearsing in the car ... and the car jerked. Tony went 'O-oHHHH- nly you.' We laughed at first, but when he sang that song‚Äîthat was the sign we had hit on something.\\" According to Buck Ram, Tony Williams' voice \\"broke\\" in rehearsal, but they decided to keep this effect in the recording. This was the only Platters recording on which songwriter and manager Ram played the piano. The song held strong in the number 1 position on the U.S. R & B charts for seven weeks, and hit number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It remained there for 30 weeks, beating out a rival cover version by The Hilltoppers. When the Platters track, \\"The Great Pretender\\" (which eventually surpassed the success of \\"Only You\\"), was released in the UK as Europe's first introduction to The Platters, \\"Only You\\" was included on the flipside. In the 1956 film Rock Around the Clock, The Platters participated with both songs, \\"Only You\\" and \\"The Great Pretender\\". The song can be heard in the opening mission of the game Batman: Arkham Knight, mirroring the end credits of Batman: Arkham City over which a recording of the Joker singing the song plays. The song also features in the game Far Cry 5, being used to Brainwash the player character by the games villains. ==The Hilltoppers version== The Hilltoppers released their version of the song as a Dot Records single in 1955. It reached number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 3 in the UK. ==Franck Pourcel version== An instrumental version by Franck Pourcel was a hit single in 1959, and sold over 5 million copies.Strictly Instrumental\\", Billboard.

The Bucharest transport network is made up of a metro network and a surface transport network. Although there are multiple connection points, the two systems operate independently of each other, are run by different organisations (the metro is run by Metrorex and the surface transport network by Societatea de Transport Bucure»ôti. The two companies used separate ticketing systems until 2017, when a new smartcard was introduced alongside the old tickets, which allows travels on both the STB and the Underground. Bombardier metro train at Pipera Station ==Bucharest Metro== Map of the Bucharest Metro as of Sep 2020 Bucharest has a fairly extensive metro system consisting of five lines (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5) run by Metrorex. In total, the network is long and has 63 stations, with average distance between stops. It is one of the fastest ways to get around the city. STB trams ==Surface transport== Surface transport in Bucharest is run by Societatea de Transport Bucure≈üti (STB) and consists of an extensive network of buses, trolleybuses, trams and light rail. The STB network is one of the most dense in Europe, and the fourth largest on the continent, carrying about 1.7 million passengers daily on 85 bus lines, 23 tram lines, 2 light rail lines and 15 trolleybus lines. At times, however, it does suffer from severe overcrowding. STB is a reasonably efficient and a very frequently-used way of getting around Bucharest. As with the Metro, the system is going under a period of renewal. Some new features are the upgrade of tram/trolleybus infrastructure and the replacement of old rolling stock. Network map of public transport in Bucharest region ===Buses=== With a total route length of ,Statistics-Length of public transport network the STB bus network is the most dense out of all the transport types in Bucharest. There are 85 bus lines (plus 25 night routes), most of which operate in the Municipality of Bucharest. However, there are also 27 bus lines which provide services to the towns and villages which border Bucharest, in Ilfov county, and whose populations usually commute to Bucharest for work. In mid-2005, the lines that linked the city to the peripheral area were licensed out to independent transportation providers, but in early 2006, they were placed once again under the control of STB due to a wide range customer complaints about the private operators. Sometime in 2010, all the STB lines of the peripheral network were removed, leading to an increase in minivans owned by private transport companies, and so far only a few of these lines have been put back. ====Fleet==== STB's bus fleet is made up of 1,143 vehicles (2018), which are all wheelchair-accessible (low floor) and around 55% are air-conditioned.Parc autobuze RATB (RATB bus fleet), Bucure≈ütiTransport, fan site by Dr2005 The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 78.1% in 2018.Raport de Activitate 2018, Societatea de Transport Bucuresti Between 2005 and 2009, the fleet underwent its most substantial process of renewal since 1989, and is now among the most modern in Europe. In December 2005, STB signed a contract for 500 Mercedes Citaro low- floor, wheelchair-accessible buses. The buses were delivered between June 2006 and April 2007. In January 2008, the first of a further series of 500 Citaro low-floor buses were put into service. The fleet makeup, as of 2019, is as following, years of delivery marked in brackets: File:Autobuz Otokar, Bucuresti.jpg Otokar Kent (2018-2019) air-conditioned 400 vehicles Image:Citaro2 bucharest.jpg Mercedes Citaro Facelift (2008-2009) air-conditioned 500 vehicles Image:Bucharest Citaro bus 3.jpg Mercedes Citaro (2006-2007) 500 vehicles As of 2020, 130 hybrid Mercedes Citaro vehicles have entered service. Low floor Mercedes Citaro buses are the main type of bus used in Bucharest (about 99%), running on almost all the routes. The prototype models, such as HESS, DAF Berkhof and Rocar Autodromo are not used anymore. Older models were retired completely from circulation (Rocar de Simon U412), but there are a few buses DAF SB220 used for regional/rural routes in Ilfov County (preorƒÉ»ôene»ôti), however retired as of 1 December 2012.

These trolleybuses now make up the majority of the fleet. In early 2007, 100 wheelchair-accessible Irisbus Citelis trolleybuses were introduced on routes 61, 62, 69, 70, 86, 90, 91 and 92. Two distinct, non-interconnected networks exist in Bucharest, the main network (comprising the two main East-West lines as well as a spur in the Northern part of town) and a relatively small Southern network in Berceni. Each of the two networks have their own, separate trolleybus depots (including separate fleets) and are not connected in any way, in 1987 being separated after the opening of M2 metro line. The trolleybus network is currently being overhauled or expanded ‚Äî a goal is to eventually unite the two networks. ====Fleet==== In 2018, the STB had a fleet of 265 trolleybuses spread across 3 depots and 1 mixed tram-trolleybus depot. Most of them were Astra-Ikarus 415T (163 trolleybuses). The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 61.8% in 2018.Raport de Activitate 2018, Societatea de Transport Bucuresti Image:91-Iveco-Citelis.jpgAstra Citelis trolleybus on Route 91 100 vehicles File:Ikarus 415T 5248 at Gara de Nord.jpgIkarus 415T trolleybus on Route 62 200 vehicles Image:Rocar DeSimon 412EA 7459 in Bujoreni depot.jpgRocar 412E.

Fortepan 31998.jpgFormer ROCAR/DAC 117E in 1986 (retired 2007). ===Trams and light rail=== STB operates a complex system of trams measuring of routes on tram network throughout Bucharest. Beside 23 tram lines, there are currently two converted light rail lines (so called metrou u≈üor which translates as \\"light metro\\"), numbered 41 and 32, which run in the western and south-western parts of Bucharest. Both lines use upgraded trams and also run on separate designated corridors for faster travel times. 67% of the city's tram infrastructure had been modernised by 2018.Raport de Activitate 2018, Societatea de Transport Bucuresti The light rail service is expected to be expanded by upgrading existing tram lines to light rail status. Most trams operated by STB (all V3A, Bucur 1 and Bucur LF models) are manufactured internally by STB at their subsidiary URAC Bucharest (the same subsidiary also handles tramway repairs and is in charge with scrapping vehicles reaching the end of their useful service life). Currently, URAC produces three models for STB - two three- section, partially low-floor, wheelchair-accessible models (V3A-CH-PPC/CA-PPC derived from the earlier V3A-93 model and the all-new Bucur-LF model) as well as a two-section, non-wheelchair-accessible model (Bucur 1), made from scrapped Tatra axles with new equipment. It is uncertain if their production will continue, because as of now their production has been halted for the past 7 years. Routes 1, 3, 10, 19, 21, 23, 32, 41 and 45 are wheelchair-accessible, using new V3A-93-M2000-PPC, V3A-CH-PPC and Bucur LF trams. Other routes will become wheelchair-accessible as soon as more V3A-CH-PPC or Bucur-LF vehicles are constructed (URAC's building capacity is limited). The maximum speed of the trams within Bucharest lies at 60 km/h ====Fleet==== In 2018, the STB had a fleet of 486 trams, most of which were the V3A-M type (323 trams). The fleet is spread across 7 tram depots and 1 mixed tram-trolleybus depot. The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 55.6% in 2018.Raport de Activitate 2018, Societatea de Transport Bucuresti Image:Bucur LF on line 1.jpgBucur LF low-floor tram Image:CH-PPC low floor tramway in Bucharest on route 41.jpgV3A-CH-PPC partial low-floor tram.

Their tickets and prices can be found on their website, available in English as well. http://www.stbsa.ro/ They include subscriptions, rechargeable cards as well as single use cards. Tickets can also be bought through SMS by sending a message to 7458, with the message U (for urban lines, any tram and trolleybus line, all bus lines except for lines starting with the letter 'R' or lines with numbers in the 400's and 700's) and the number of the line. This works for most network providers and charges 0.3 EUR + VAT (0.05 EUR). This is valid for an hour and can only be used on the line selected. Multiple texts can be sent at the same time for more than one person. For regional lines starting with the letter \\"R\\" and with numbers in the 400's, send the letter \\"R\\" followed by the line number, 0.6 EUR will be charged. For express lines, (line number in the 700's) send the letter \\"E\\" followed by the line number, 0.9 EUR will be charged. This method of payment is also available through the app, InfoTB. The app can also plan routes using all types of transportation in the city, and show the GPS location of vehicles. Approximately 85% of vehicles are equipped with a GPS positioning system. A separate app, BPay, can also be used to pay for fares, using an online account and credit card information. An online account can also be created on the website, that allows clients to add credit to their tickets. BCR (Romanian Commercial Bank) ATMs also allow clients to recharge their physical cards with money. Metrorex and STB have an integrated ticket, available for 5 RON, that allows passengers to use any metro and surface transportation line for 60 minutes. This is a single use ticket, that can only be used by one person. Other than that, the metro network has a separate ticketing system, explained on their website in English, http://www.metrorex.ro/travel_tickets_p1382-2 The zones have no impact on the price of a journey. Passengers can also simply tap their contactless credit cards directly on the turnstiles, charging 2.5 RON for every tap, the price of one journey. For multiple validations, press the + button on the turnstile and tap again. This is currently available in 49 of the 52 stations. A blue background with a blurb in both Romanian and English is printed on the turnstiles, indicating that this method of payment is available. The normal tickets are magnetic and can be damaged by exposure to other electromagnetic fields. ===Private cars=== At the end of 2008, in Bucharest there were 1.24 million vehicles, of which 985.000 were private cars. In 2007 there were 150.000 fewer vehicles, which means the number of vehicles increased by 13.76% in one year.Hot News Parcul Auto din Romania a trecut de cinci milioane vehicule. Un sfert din ele sunt in Bucuresti. With so many cars and a very high population density (50% higher than Tokyo and 4 times bigger than Rome for example), parking is a problem in Bucharest. File:Trafic Pantelimon (2).jpg File:Bucure≈üti 6.JPG ==CFR Trains== In 2011, Bucharest had 99 km of railway lines, 79 of which were electric.Planul de Dezvoltare Regionala a Regiunii Bucuresti-Ilfov 2014-2020, Iulie 2015, pg.70 Bucharest has several train stations throughout and around the city, the main one being Gara de Nord where trains to all destinations leave. Other main stations include Baneasa, Obor and Basarab. Gara de Nord is a relatively modern station. It was opened in 1872 and has undergone modernization and refurbishment several times. From here, trains leave to every destination in Romania and also other European cities. The other stations only see around five trains a day and are not considered \\"important\\" stations by CFR. Bucharest was once home to a vast system of industrial railways that sprawled all over the city, linking factories to the surrounding neighbourhoods and towns. However most of these are now gone and what remains has fallen into disrepair. Therefore, Bucharest hadn‚Äôt an RER/S-Bahn type of commuter network until 2019 when CFR introduced commuter trains between the city and Buftea. Attempts have been made in the past to introduce such a system, but so far not much has been achieved. It is true that there are trains operated by CFR from Bucharest to neighbouring towns, however due to long journey times and poor rolling stock most people tend to use personal cars to get into the city. ==Road network== Magheru Boulevard at night The city's municipal road network is centred on a series of high-capacity boulevards (6 to 10 lanes), which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts and are arranged in geographical axes (principally north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast). The principal and thus most congested boulevards are Calea Victoriei, Bulevardul Unirii and »òoseaua Mihai Bravu, which is the longest in Bucharest and forms a sort of semicircle around the northeastern part of the old district. The city also has two ring roads, one internal (Mihai Bravu is part of it) and one external, which are mainly used for cars that bypass the city as well as trucks, which aren't allowed in the city centre. Aside from the main roads, the city also has a number of secondary roads, which connect the main boulevards. In the historical city centre, particularly the Lipscani area, many streets are cobbled and are classified as pedestrian zones. The city's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. Every day, there are more than one million vehicles travelling within the city limits.Governing programme of Adriean Videanu, General Mayor of Bucharest This has resulted in wearing of the upper layer of tarmac on many of roads in Bucharest, particularly secondary roads which are now used in an equal amount, this being identified as one of Bucharest's main infrastructural problems. The pothole problem is notorious enough to have inspired a song by the band Taxi with a chorus \\"Cratere ca-n Bucure≈üti, nici pe luna nu gase≈üti!\\" (\\"Craters like in Bucharest you won't even find on the moon\\").Simona Tudorache, Taxi a iesit cu Politica in strada, Curierul Na≈£ional, 23 October 2004. However, in recent years, there has been a comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost improvement of road infrastructure, mainly by resurfacing and widening roads, and repairing footpaths. Faulty urban planning will likely lead to an increase in traffic and parking problems, since new housing areas are built with houses and apartment buildings literally squeezed into existing small grid roads, a problem commonly identified in the \\"suburbs\\" of the city. Bucharest is one of the principal junctions of Romania's national road network, which links the city to all of Romania's major cities as well as to neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine. Romania's three motorways currently in operation, the A1, the A2 which links the capital with the country's ports and seaside resorts on the Black Sea and the A3. ==Airports== Bucharest has one international airport: * Henri CoandƒÉ International Airport, located north of the Bucharest metropolitan area, in the town of Otopeni, Ilfov. Currently the airport has one terminal divided into three inter-connected buildings (International Departures Hall, International Arrivals Hall and the Domestic Flights Hall - at the ground level of the Arrivals Hall - ). The International Departures Hall consists of 36 check-in desks, one finger with 10 gates (5 equipped with jetways), while the Domestic Hall has an extra four gates. Today's International Arrivals Hall is the old Otopeni terminal, while the new Departures Hall, including the finger and the airbridges was built and inaugurated in 1997. A second finger with 7 jetways is under construction and a new building terminal on the east side is in project phase. The airport received 8,317,168 passengers in 2015. It is accessible by STB buses 780, 782, 783 and 784 and the future M6 underground line, which will link the airport with the main train station of Bucharest. Until 2012 there was also another airport which is no longer used, except for charter/private flights: *Aurel Vlaicu International Airport is situated only 8 km north of the Bucharest city centre and is accessible by STB buses 131, 335, 605, 780, 783, 784 and taxi. ==Water transport== Although it is situated on the banks of a river, Bucharest has never functioned as a port city, with other Romanian cities such as Constan≈£a and BrƒÉila acting as the country's main ports. However, the Danube-Bucharest Canal, which is 73 km long, was under construction until 1990 and is not being worked on as of 2015. When eventually finished, the canal will link Bucharest to the Danube River and, via the Danube-Black Sea Canal, to the Black Sea. This transport corridor is expected to be a significant component of the city's transport infrastructure and increase sea traffic by a large margin. ==Notes== ==External links== *Official site of STB (surface transport operator) *Official site of Metrorex (subway transport operator) *Site that contains all about RATB, depots, vehicles, news *Site that contains all about the Bucharest Subway Www.cfr.ro is the website for info timetables etc ","title":"Transport in Bucharest"},{"id":"1296357","text":"The Senshu Bank, Ltd.

She was the first ship named for Andrew Sterett. Sterett was laid down on 22 March 1909 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company. Sponsored by Miss Dorothy Rosalie Sterett Gittings, the destroyer was launched on 12 May 1910 and commissioned on 15 December 1910 at Boston, Massachusetts, Lieutenant Robert L. Berry in command. ==Pre-World War I== Each year until 1913, Sterett operated along the east coast out of Boston from April to December and, from January to April, participated in training and battle exercises out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Though placed in reserve on 5 November 1913, she continued duty with the torpedo fleet. On 20 January 1914, she sailed from Charleston, South Carolina, and reached New Orleans, Louisiana on 2 March, after stops at Cape Canaveral, Miami, Key West, Florida, and at Mobile, Alabama. The following day, she joined the newly created Reserve Torpedo Flotilla, operating in the Gulf of Mexico out of Galveston, Texas. In June, she returned to the Atlantic seaboard, this time based at Norfolk, Virginia, and resumed coastal patrols and Caribbean exercises. Steretts complement was reduced on 5 January 1916 and, throughout that spring; she operated almost exclusively in the Caribbean. On 1 June, she was a part of the fleet which landed and supported the Marines at Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic, and marched to Santiago to restore order and to protect lives and property. Soon thereafter, Sterett returned to Norfolk and resumed operations along the east coast. On 1 January 1917, she entered the Mississippi, stopped at New Orleans, and steamed up river to Vicksburg, Mississippi. She reentered the gulf and patrolled the Texas coast until she was shifted to Key West on 18 March. From there, the destroyer ranged as far as the Cuban coast. ==World War I== In April 1917, the United States entered World War I, and by 9 June, Sterett was in Queenstown, Ireland. Throughout the remainder of the war, she operated from Queenstown to meet convoys and conduct them to either Berehaven, Ireland, or to Devonport, England. At these points, British and French destroyers assumed responsibility for the last leg of the voyage. A little less than a year after her arrival at Queenstown, on 31 May 1918, Sterett was herding a convoy toward the rendezvous point when she came upon a surfaced U-boat. As Sterett closed, the submarine rapidly submerged. Sterett began dropping depth charges furiously, and air bubbles and oil soon appeared on the surface, indicating damage to the German raider. After exhausting her supply of depth charges, Sterett pursued the enemy by the U-boat's wake of bubbles and trail of oil, hoping to force her to exhaust her batteries and air supply. She continued the pursuit through the night, guided in the darkness only by the fumes of the sub's leaking oil. Finally, at dawn, the destroyer's persistence was rewarded. She sighted the U-boat on the surface about ahead. Sterett sliced through the waves at top speed seeking to ram the submarine, but the U-boat countered by swinging hard to port. Sterett passed within of the submarine and, as the U-boat attempted to dive, brought her guns to bear. However, without sufficient time to bracket their adversary, Steretts gunners watched helplessly as the submarine slid beneath the surface and escaped. For their dogged determination, the officers and men of Sterett received the commendation of the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland. The year 1918 brought with it an all-out effort on the part of the Central Powers to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The German Navy increased the intensity of its submarine operations in order to free Germany from the Allies' ever- tightening blockade. In response to this thrust, Sterett maintained a grueling schedule of convoy duty-a week or more at sea followed by a day or two in port. One of her new techniques, the use of airborne surveillance, presaged modern hunter-killer antisubmarine warfare. ==Inter-war period== The Allies prevailed, however, and the Armistice, signed on 11 November, brought an end to Steretts strenuous duty; and, by 3 January 1919, she was back in the United States at Charleston. From there, she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she was decommissioned on 9 December. On 9 March 1935, after a little more than 15 years of inactivity, Sterett was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 28 June, she was sold for scrapping to M. Black and Company of Norfolk, Virginia. ==References== Category:Paulding-class destroyers Category:World War I destroyers of the United States Category:Ships built in Quincy, Massachusetts Category:1910 ships ","title":"USS Sterett (DD-27)"},{"id":"1296387","text":"National Association Grounds was a baseball grounds in Cleveland, Ohio.

When the dust settled, they saw they had opened up a small room, approximately 4 ft tall, 4 ft wide, and about 15 ft deep. This is where they said that they first saw the mummy of a tiny person. This first mummy was examined using X-rays which determined that it was the body of an anencephalic infant \\"whose cranial deformity gave it the appearance of a miniature adult.\\" A second mummy examined by University of Wyoming anthropologist George Gill and the Denver Children's Hospital in the 1990s was also shown to be an anencephalic infant. DNA testing showed it to be Native American and radiocarbon dating dated it to about 1700. According to a July 7, 1979, article in the Casper Star-Tribune the first mummy started debates over whether it was a hoax, a baby, or one of the legendary \\"little people\\". The mummy ended up in Meeteetse, Wyoming at a local drug store where it was shown as an attraction for several years before it was bought by Ivan T. Goodman, a Casper, Wyoming businessman. The mummy was then passed on to Leonard Wadler, a New York businessman, and its present location is unknown.

The population in 2011 was 3,757,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 5.98 km2.Eurostat It is located on the periphery of the urbanized area of the city of Angra do Hero√≠smo (approximately four from the center), and developed from a small fishing port in a bay along the volcanic coast of the island (calheta is Portuguese for small bay). ==History== A view of S√£o Mateus da Calheta in 1903 During the early period of settlement, the S√£o Mateus coast was dotted by bays, some peppered with small beaches. One of these, which became known as Prainha, soon became the centre of a small fishing port. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing in his sixth volume of Saudades da Terra, referred to the area as S√£o Mateus da Prainha, noting: \\"In addition to the church of S√£o Mateus Al√©m, is a small bay of white sand and small stones in places, where on occasion they throw-out their nets and trammels to catch many fish, principally mullet.\\" It was Pedro de Merelim who first coined the name S√£o Mateus da Prainha, in his chapter on the parish, in As 18 par√≥quias de Angra. During the 1580s, in anticipation of eventual attacks by forces loyal to King Philip II of Spain, the first forts began to be constructed along the coast: six forts lined the banks of the parishes coast, which included the Grande Fort and the Fort of Negrito. They served the purpose of defending political activities in the archipelago, but also safeguarded the pillaging from pirates and privateers that occurred during this period (which was the justification for the construction of the Fort of the Terreiro, the Fort of the Mar√©, the Fort of M√° Ferramenta and the Fort of S√£o Jo√£o (S√£o Mateus da Calheta) (also known as the Fort of Biscoitinho). The final defences were completed during the Second World War, with the extension of trenches and installation of gun emplacements. Father Manuel Lu√≠s Maldonado, writing in his work Fenix Nagrense, recounted the penitence of the peoples of the parish, as a sequence of the 26 March 1690 storm and 5 April 1690 earthquake. These accounts explain the strong relationship between the parish of S√£o Mateus and S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos, and the existence of a parochial church in the vicinity of the old church, the reference to fishing and the level of poverty. Father Ant√≥nio Cordeiro, writing in 1710 wrote of large estates, the coastal fortresses (some with more than 9 pieces of artillery), their garrisons and of the community of S√£o Matues \\"with more than 50 neighbours\\" spread across the territory. Cordeiro also wrote of the fishing: \\"...this bay in S√£o Mateus, of white sand and small pebbles, where they catch a lot of fish, and salmonettes.\\" The primitive parochial church, constructed at Ponta de S. Mateus around 1557, would substitute the older chapel. During the construction, the people returned to the smaller Hermitage of Luz to complete the weekly rituals. The new church (today known as the Old Church) was completed in 1700, and functioned in that role until a 28 August 1893 hurricane when the church was destroyed and abandoned. Between 1694 and 1700 the church was demolished and reconstructed farther to the interior: a cross was left in the former churchyard. Writing in 1834, Lu√≠s de Meireles do Canto e Castro, a local resident, complained of the poor protection the seawall offered, resulting in repeated encroachments by the sea. During the 18th century and early 19th century, the population grew rapidly and the first defensive structure began appearing along the Terreiro and beach near the port. After the 18th century the character of the parish began to change: the population grew and much of the economic activity moved away the orchards of the local estates. ==Geography== The civil parish occupies a small triangular territory along the southern coast of Terceira, confined in the south by the sea, west by the civil parish of S√£o Bartolomeu de Regatos, northeast by Terra Ch√£ and east by S√£o Pedro. ===Physical geography=== The territory extends through the transition al zone within the Santa B√°rbara massif and volcanic complex of the Serra do Mori√£o, in a zone that is relatively low, with a slope of less than five percent grade until elevation, along a north-northwest tract. The highest point in the parish is situated in the extreme north of Canada da Cruz Dourada along Canada de Tr√°s. In the central part of the territory is the basaltic spatter cone Pico dos Merens: its peak is named after one of the local families who, for centuries, were local property-owners in the region: the Merens of T√°vora. Also known as Pico de Merens or Pico do Alvernaz, the cone is elevation, and responsible for the Biscoitinho Platform that extends to the sea. The Biscoitinho Platform, over which the main built-up part of the civil parish is situated, terminates at small rectangular promontory consisting of several coves and bays. One of these bays, which is relatively deep, provided shelter for early settlers from western and southwestern weather systems, giving rise to the port of S√£o Mateus. Another cove to the west, which is wider and open to the sea, resulted in the settlement of Terreiro. To the east and west of the Biscoitinho Platform the coast is low, with altitudes less than , consisting of basalt primarily, with some pyroclasts. The exception is the zone of Ponta de S√£o Mateus, near the old church, where the coast is covered in a thick layer of ignimbrites. To the east of the port there two areas, Ba√≠a das Merc√™s and Po√ßo da Luz, where the coast is almost level with the sea, and where stone beaches are common. Historically, there have been records of tsunamis or southerly swells that have inundated the areas (the last occurring on 18 February 2003), while the area the territory is delimited by wall to protect the roadway.Liduino Borba (2003), pp.90-97 West, after the Calheta do Terreiro, the coast extends further into the sea, yet still only less than above sea level, forming the tip of S√£o Mateus. Being on the coast, the area is influenced by Atlantic storms, resulting in the construction of various barriers. In the small bay of Negrito, historically defended by the Fort of Negrito and location of a former whaling port, are the principal swimming areas on the island. After Negrito is the western limit of the civil parish in the area known as Chanoca, an area of basalt cliffs with difficult access. ===Human geography=== The parochial church is at the centre of the old fishing community of S√£o Mateus. A juxtoposition of the parochial church and the Fort Grande Holy Spirit Chapel The structure of S√£o Mateus is different from other parishes in the southwest corner of Terceira, with a specific economy associated with fishing and services. While the upper regions of the parish has marked by rural character, the central area is primarily urban, centred around the parochial church and fishing community. The parish contains the localities Bairro Novo, Canada da Cruz Dourada, Canada da Igreja, Canada do Capit√£o Mor, Canada do Pombal, Canada dos Cal√ßos, Canada dos Folhadais, Canada Francesa, S√£o Mateus and Terra P√£o. These 50 named agglomerations are connected by a patchwork of linear roadways extending from the Estrada Regional E.R.1-1¬™, organized into:Liduino Borba (2003), p.89 * S√£o Mateus ‚Äî the main village, centred on Biscoitinho and port, includes a dense urban concentration with numerous roads and cul de sacs, characterized by the homes of the poor and fishermen. Towards the west the agglomeration abruptly terminates at Terreiro, limited by the zone of Arrife, which is almost underpopulated, except for the homes of the early gentry and noble classes of Angra. In the east, towards Angra do Hero√≠smo, the urban area extends along the coast, broken by the Fortress of S√£o Mateus da Calheta, towards the social housing of the Bairro dos Pescadores constructed during the Estado Novo regime. The construction of social housing in Terreiro, the periphery of the Bairro dos Pescadores and beginning of the Canada da Arruda resulted in a high urban density, giving the parish the character of an extension of Angra. In the extreme east of the parish, in the zone between Po√ßo da Luz and the border with S√£o Pedro, are many of the 18th and 19th century estates that pertained to the aristocratic families of Terceira; * Cantinho ‚Äî this is the secondary urban agglomeration of the parish, characterized by linear growth along the route between Angra and S√£o Bartolomeu dos Regatos (known as the Caminho do Meio). Its center is situated at the Hermitage of S√£o Francisco das Almas, a name that once served as the toponymic reference, but actually includes Entre- Ladeiras, Terra do P√£o and Canada da Francesa. It is a zone that is markedly rural, inhabited by farmers and similar to the parishes of the western part of the island, and socially separate from the rest of the parish, with its own primary school, imp√©rio and parochial churches.; * The Canadas ‚Äî connecting the coastal roadway (or Caminho de Baixo) with the Angra-S√£o Bartolomeu dos Regatos access (Caminho do Meio) are several secondary lines of residences known as Canadas da Luz, da Arruda, do Capit√£o-Mor and da Cruz Dourada, that were extended linearly along these roads. These were transitional spaces, lightly populated, between the coastal fishing communities and their rural interior.

It is the capital of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district. It was the birthplace of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, to whom a monument was erected in 1876. Founded about 1210, it was the seat of the short-lived Lordship of Parchim-Richenberg, a partition of the Duchy of Mecklenburg, from 1226 until 1248 when the lord relocated to Richenberg. Parchim was absorbed into the Lordship of Werle in 1255. In 1277 Werle was partitioned and Parchim became the seat of Werle-Parchim until it was reunited with Werle-G√ºstrow in 1307. One branch of the family of the duke of Mecklenburg resided in Parchim during part of the 14th century. It became a prosperous industrial town during the 16th century, but this prosperity was destroyed by the Thirty Years' War.

A gifted singer and arranger, Ward adopted the lead-switching style, previously used primarily by male gospel quartets, creating opportunities for spontaneous improvisation and vamping by each member of the group, while giving virtuoso singers such as Marion Williams the opportunity to perform the lead vocal in songs such as \\"Surely, God Is Able\\" (among the first million-selling gospel hits), \\"How I Got Over\\" and \\"Packin' Up\\". ==Career== Ward's mother, Gertrude Mae Ward (nee Murphy; 1901-1981), founded the Ward Singers in 1931 as a family group, then called, variously, The Consecrated Gospel Singers or The Ward Trio, consisting of herself, her youngest daughter Clara, and her elder daughter, Willarene Mae (\\"Willa\\"). Ward recorded her first solo song in 1940, and continued accompanying the Ward Gospel Trio, thereafter. ===1931‚Äì1952: The Ward Singers=== The Ward Singers began touring nationally in 1943, following a memorable appearance at the National Baptist Convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, earlier that year. Henrietta Waddy joined the group in 1947. Waddy brought to the group a \\"rougher\\" alto sound and the enthusiastic stage manners learned from her South Carolina Pentecostal church background. The group's performance style, such as the mimed packing of suitcases as part of the song \\"Packin' Up\\", condemned by some gospel music purists as \\"clowning\\", was wildly popular with their audiences. The addition of Marion Williams, who arose of the Miami, Florida Pentecostal tradition brought to the group a powerful singer with a preternaturally broad range, able to reach the highest registers of the soprano range without losing either purity or volume, with the added ability to descend \\"growling low notes\\" in the style of a country preacher. Williams' singing style helped make the group nationally popular when they began recording in 1948. In 1949, the Ward Singers toured from Philadelphia to California in their new Cadillac, appeared on national television programs, and recorded for the Miltone Record Company of Los Angeles. The Miltone recordings were purchased in a multi-artist package by Gotham Record Company, which had moved to Philadelphia. Gotham's Irv Ballen recorded some new Ward material, including \\"Surely God Is Able\\", and some of the Ward Singers' Gotham recordings were transferred to Savoy Record Company in Newark, New Jersey to settle a contract dispute. When Savoy began contracting with the Ward Singers for new recordings in the 1950s, they were primarily recorded and engineered in Bergen County, New Jersey, by Rudy Van Gelder. In 1950, Clara Ward and the Famous Ward Singers of Philadelphia made their first Carnegie Hall appearance on a gospel program titled Negro Music Festival, produced by gospel music pioneer, Joe Bostic, sharing the stage with Mahalia Jackson, appearing at the famed venue for Bostic's program in 1952, as well. Gertrude Ward created a booking agency for gospel acts, sponsored tours under the name \\"The Ward Gospel Cavalcade\\", established a publishing house for gospel music, and wrote an instructional manual for churches, detailing how to promote gospel programs. Gertrude created and managed a second group, \\"The Clara Ward Specials\\", to accompany the Ward Singers. Although as musical director of the Ward franchise, Clara was willing to share the spotlight with her talented co-singers, she and her mother were allegedly reticent about sharing the group's financial rewards with other members, as well. According to Willa Ward's biography of Clara Ward, with the exception of Gertrude and Clara, Willa and other members of the group were grossly underpaid. In addition, their meager earnings were further reduced as Gertrude and Clara provided the group's housing and charged them for it. Accordingly, stars such as Marion Williams and Frances Steadman not only had to accept second billing and lesser pay for their work, but pay their employers rent out of their earnings. Williams left the group in 1958, when her demand for a raise and reimbursement for hotel expenses was rejected. She was followed shortly thereafter by the rest of the group‚ÄîHenrietta Waddy, Esther Ford, Frances Steadman and Kitty Parham‚Äîwho formed a new group, \\"The Stars of Faith\\". Their departure marked the end of the glory days for the Ward Singers, who later alienated much of their churchgoing audience by performing in Las Vegas, nightclubs, and other secular venues in the 1960s. By this time, gospel singer Albertina Walker formed her group, The Caravans, in 1952, following the advice of her mentor Mahalia Jackson, and their group began to grow in popularity. In 1963, Clara Ward was the second gospel singer to sing gospel songs on Broadway in Langston Hughes' play Tambourines To Glory(The first being her former group members, which were known as the Stars of Faith, which starred Langston Hughes in the first Gospel stage play and first play that featured an all black cast to be produced on Broadway, The Black Nativity.). She was also the play's musical director. ===1953‚Äì1972: The Clara Ward Singers=== Ward was the first gospel singer to sing with a 100-piece symphony orchestra in the 1960s. The Clara Ward Singers recorded an album together on the Verve label, V-5019, The Heart, The Faith, The Soul of Clara Ward, and the Ward Singers performed their music live in Philadelphia with the city's Symphony and the Golden Voices Ensemble. Ward sang backup for pop artists with her sister Willa's background group, most notably on Dee Dee Sharp's hit, \\"Mashed Potato Time\\", which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962. In 1969, Ward recorded an album for Capitol Records, Soul and Inspiration, consisting of pop songs from Broadway plays, Hollywood movies and the Jimmy Radcliffe song of hope \\"If You Wanna Change The World\\". The album was later reissued on the Capitol's budget Pickwick label minus one track. In the same year, she recorded an album in Copenhagen, Denmark on the Philips label, Walk A Mile In My Shoes, which included the pop title song, other pop songs (such as \\"California Dreaming\\") and a few gospel songs. Ward also recorded an album for MGM/Verve, Hang Your Tears Out To Dry, which included country and Western, blues/folk, pop and an arrangement of the Beatles' hit song, \\"Help\\". Her 1972 album Uplifting on United Artists, produced by Nikolas Venet and Sam Alexander, included an interpretation of Bill Wither's pop hit \\"Lean On Me\\" and a rearrangement of the Soul Stirrer's 1950's recording of \\"Thank You, Jesus\\". Also in 1972 Ward, because she was under exclusive contract to United Artists at this time, provided vocals for a Canned Heat's album The New Age, on the ballad \\"Lookin' For My Rainbow\\"; it was released on that album and as a single 45 rpm record. In 1968, The Clara Ward Singers toured Vietnam at the request of the U.S. State Department and the U.S.O. It was a popular war-time tour supported by recorded radio broadcasts of the Ward Singers on U.S. Armed Forces Radio. The Ward Singers narrowly missed death when their hotel in Vietnam was bombed and several guests died. Ward was invited back to Vietnam by U.S.O. in 1969 for several more months. These war-time tours were filmed and all the Ward Singers were given special certificates of recognition by the U.S. Army. Ward co- starred in the Hollywood movie A Time to Sing, starring Hank Williams, Jr., Shelley Fabares, Ed Begley, and D'Urville Martin. She was cast as a waitress in a Nashville, Tennessee cafeteria who inspires a young singer, played by Hank Williams, Jr., to pursue his dream of becoming a country recording artist. There are also several scenes of the Clara Ward Singers performing gospel songs in the film. This movie was released by MGM in 1968 and Clara's picture appears on lobby cards and other movie advertisements. Other movie appearances include Its Your Thing, starring The Isley Brothers, and Spree, also known as Night Time In Las Vegas. The Clara Ward Singers toured in Australia, Japan, Europe, Indonesia, and Thailand during the late-1960s through the early-1970s. They had a one-day TV special in London, England. They were in constant demand on American television programs and appeared on The Mike Douglas Show over a dozen times. They appeared on Oral Roberts' Country Roads TV special, later released as a soundtrack album. Clara continued to perform at her mother's church, the Miracle Temple of Faith for All People in Los Angeles, California, as well as at Victory Baptist Church. Her mother, Gertrude Ward, also had a popular religious radio program in the Los Angeles market. ==Personal life== Despite her career success Clara's life was an unhappy one. Financial hardships caused her and her family to move 19 times before her adulthood. Sexually abused in childhood by a cousin and relentlessly driven as prime breadwinner by her mother throughout her life, Clara's life was one of constant work and little joy. According to her sister Willa, Gertrude Ward recognized Clara's exceptional musical ability when Clara was a child and controlled and manipulated Clara throughout her life. In her biography of Clara her sister Willa attests that Gertrude worked to prevent Clara from forming any romantic attachments. Although Clara eloped as a teenager (at age 17 in 1941), her mother Gertrude forced her to tour and the strain caused the always frail Clara to have a miscarriage. Her marriage ended after only one year. Willa describes Clara as explaining her occasional lesbian encounters as the sexual expression likely to escape her mother's notice. Her only real happiness seems to have come from her longtime romance with Rev. C. L. Franklin (with whom the Ward groups extensively toured), the famous Detroit-based preacher and father of legendary Aretha Franklin. Clara spent much time in the Franklin home and, along with Mahalia Jackson (another close Franklin family friend), mentored Aretha. Clara's depression resulted in alcoholism. ==Health, death, and legacy== Ward collapsed while performing at the Castaways Lounge in Miami Beach, Florida in May 1966. Ward suffered a series of strokes prior to her death. The first occurred in August 1967 which was listed as \\"massive\\". Two more strokes followed: one listed as \\"minor\\" during a recording session at her home in December 1972; another on January 9, 1973 which left Ward in a coma. Ward died on January 16, 1973 at age 48 as a result of the strokes. Aretha Franklin and Rev. C. L. Franklin sang at her funeral in Philadelphia; Marion Williams sang at her second memorial service held days later in Los Angeles, California. Clara Ward is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. In 1977, Ward was honored posthumously at the Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York City and her surviving sister, Willa, accepted the award in her honor. In July 1998, in recognition of her status, the United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp with her image. The stamp can still be purchased with a CD and other gospel singers' stamps online. Ward's beautiful alto (with a distinctly nasal tone) in gospel songs and the Methodist hymns of the 18th century continues to delight music lovers. She had a marked influence on later singers, such as her protegee Aretha Franklin, who adopted her moan for secular songs and who saluted Ward in Amazing Grace, the gospel album she made with James Cleveland in the early 1970s. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Clara Ward among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Discography== * Soul & Inspiration, Digital download released by Stateside Records *Clara Ward and Her Gospel Singers at the Village Gate (1963) Vanguard VRS-9135 (m) VSD-2151 (s) ==References== ==Further reading== *Boyer, Horace Clarence, How Sweet the Sound: The Golden Age of Gospel Elliott and Clark, 1995, . *Heilbut, Tony The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times Limelight Editions, 1997, . *Salvatore, Nick, Singing in a Strange Land: C.

Its detection range is limited by line-of-sight but may be up to for very high altitude, very powerful emitters. Frequently referred to as Kolchuga Radar, the system is not really a radar, but an ESM system comprising three or four receivers, deployed tens of kilometres apart, which detect and track aircraft by triangulation and multilateration of their RF emissions. ==History== Original Kolchuga was developed in 1980s by Rostov military institute of GRU and Topaz radioelectronical factory in Donetsk. Serial production since 1987. 44 units were produced before 1 January 1992, 14 of them left in Ukraine. After break up of Soviet Union, Kolchuga-M was modernized by the Special Radio Device Design Bureau public holding, the Topaz holding, the Donetsk National Technical University, the Ukrspetsexport state company, and the Investment and Technologies Company. It took them eight years (1993‚Äì2000) to conduct research, develop algorithms, test solutions on experimental specimens, and launch serial production. The relatively cheap Ukrainian Kolchuga-M passive radar station is able to detect and identify practically all known active radio devices mounted on ground, airborne, or marine objects. ==Mode of operation== Kolchuga is an electronic support measures system that employs two or more sites to locate emitters by triangulation. The system is vehicle mounted and comprises a large vertical meshed reflector, with two smaller circular parabolic dishes beneath and a pair of VHF-to-microwave log periodic antennas above. The dishes may exploit amplitude monopulse techniques for improved direction finding, whilst the angled spacing of the log-periodic antenna suggests that they may use phase interferometry to improve angle measurements. Various smaller antennas, presumably for inter-site communications are to the side and rear of the dish. The detection range is one of the best in its class, but it is highly dependent on the emitted power of the transmitter being tracked, and requires satisfaction of the line of sight condition to at least two receiving sites for triangulation (compared with three sites for a multilateration system such as the VERA passive sensor). A Kolchuga complex can detect and locate air and surface targets and trace their movement to a range generally limited only by the common line-of-sight of the stations. Assuming no terrain masking, the line-of-sight range of a single Kolchuga station (in km) is approximately (Skolnik 1981): :d(km) =130(\\\\sqrt{hr(km)}+\\\\sqrt{ht(km)}) where hr(km) is the height of the radar in km, and ht(km) is the height of the target in kilometres, and assuming standard atmospheric radio refraction. Thus, for a Kolchuga at 100 m altitude (above local terrain) and a target at 10 km (30 kft), the range of the system would be approximately 450 km. For targets at altitudes of 20 km (60 kft) the line of sight limitation would be 620 km--but few targets fly at such altitudes. Being line-of-sight limited, the system is an effective early warning air defense system against high power emitters. ===System parameters=== According to the manufacturer's brochure (from AIDEX 1997), the upgraded Kolchuga-M is equipped: > *With four antennas in the VHF, UHF and SHF radio bands with narrow and wide > beams *With parallel receivers allowing the instant discovery and analysis > of signals of radio technical equipment (RTE) in the range 100 MHz -18 GHz > and continual tracking across the entire band. [Other sources claim from > 130MHz to 18GHz, and a 36 channel preset receiver]. *With sensitivity of > approximately -145 dBW *With equipment for the analysis, processing and > continual calculation and tracking of coordinates by triangulation and > chronometrical-hyperbolic method. *With equipment for the identification, > operative displaying of information, long term memory and recording of the > results of processing. The brochure also claims that the system provides: > *The detection, analysis of signals with pulsed and continuous waves and > resolution of practically all known radio technical equipment (RTE) deployed > on ground, sea and air platforms, including radar units of all classes, > identification systems, air traffic control system and navigation systems > *The composition, character of operation and flight paths of RTE in a zone > 600 km deep with complete exception of blind zones and continual high > accuracy *The detection of take-off of aerial targets and their formation in > groups at a distance exceeding that of modern radars. *The direction of > arrival of solitary and group targets and target indication to active > facilities of anti-aircraft systems Special inhibitory sorters omit up to 24 interfering signals, and tracking sorters make it possible to synchronously sort out and track signals from 32 targets; ===Target identification=== Kolchuga is able to detect and identify many types of radio devices mounted on ground, airborne, or marine objects. Target detection relies only on an emitter having sufficient power and being within Kolchuga's frequency range. Target identification, however, is more complex and is based on the measurement of different parameters of the transmitted signal--such as its frequency, bandwidth, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, etc. Kolchuga has been reported to use around forty different parameters when identifying a target. These parameters are compared to a database in order to identify both the type of emitter and, in some cases, even the specific piece of equipment (by identifying the unique signature or \\"fingerprint\\" that most transmitters have, due to the variations and tolerances in individual components). The database within Kolchuga is said to have the capacity to store around three hundred different types of emitter and up to five hundred specific signatures for each type. ==Exports== Pakistan has expressed interest in purchasing the Kolchuga radar. Ukraine has offered it to Pakistan to counter India's Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar.Embassy of Ukraine to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan - Publications In 2002 the U.S. State Department accused Ukraine of selling Kolchuga to Iraq, based on recordings of the then Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma supposedly made by Mykola Mel'nychenko. This was followed by political steps from United Kingdom and the United States. No material confirmation has been found in Iraq. See Cassette Scandal for further information. Unconfirmed reports in September 2006 suggested a sale was made to IranGlobal Defence News and Defence Headlines - IHS Jane's 360Iran: An Army of Smugglers Marches to Victory although this was denied by the Ukrainian government.Ukraine denies sale of sophisticated radar to Iran - Irna On 20th of January 2019, Ukrainian news Sources confirmed a Sale of Systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia. ==Rumours and speculation of performance== Since becoming publicly known following the Cassette Scandal, the capabilities of Kolchuga have been the source of many rumours and uninformed speculation in forums such as.Iran's KOLCHUGA antenna device passively detects stealth planes 800 Km away Many observers have a tendency to credit it with magical powers of detection. Many of these do not stand up to detailed engineering analysis, or have not been confirmed, but are recorded in this section for completeness, together with reasons for doubting the claim. Note that the material in this section should not be regarded as accurate. Claims include: * That Kolchuga has a range of 800 km. It will certainly have the sensitivity to see high power sources at such a range. However, basic line-of-sight arguments outlined in the sections above show that this would require aircraft to be flying at impractically high altitudes and/or for the Kolchuga stations to be deployed on very high mountains. The claim is thus technically possible but operationally very unlikely. * That Kolchuga can detect US stealth aircraft by their radio and radar emissions. Whilst technically possible, stealth aircraft do not radiate when in battle, so this mode of operation is militarily irrelevant. * Kolchuga is sufficiently sensitive to detect US stealth aircraft from unconventional sources of RF emissions, including radiation from exhaust trails and electromagnetic interference from the engine. (Technically the power levels of these sources are likely to be so small, if at all, that there would be insufficient energy for Kolchuga to measure these effects at one site, let alone the two or more required for triangulation. They would also be almost impossible to distinguish for normal background RF noise and would not appear like the conventional emissions types Kolchuga is designed to receive and analyse). * Kolchuga is sufficiently sensitive to operate as a bistatic radar receiver and hence exploit other transmitters in the environment. (This is likely to be true for the specific case of forward scatter in which the radar cross section of even a stealth aircraft can become very large for a few moments. However, achieving forward scatter simultaneously in two or more receivers is geometrically impossible, so triangulation would not work. Secondly, unless Kolchuga has been specifically designed to work as a bistatic radar receiver with a certain radar type--and there's no evidence of Kolchuga being deployed in conjunction with specific radar types--then it will lack the essential matched filter required to reliably detect reflected pulses in the presence of noise. Therefore, if this effect works at all, it is likely to be unreliable and fleeting). * Ukrainian sources often make claims such as \\"[Kolchuga] is head and shoulders above all American, Russian, French, Czech, or Brazilian developments in this field\\". Such claims are unsubstantiated and pure speculation, as the performance and even existence of many ESM systems are highly classified and not deducible by ELINT. It may or may not be true, but must be regarded with caution, particularly as those making the claims are often either journalists or those with an interest in exporting the system. ==See also== *BORAP ‚Äì a similar system using triangulation developed in the Czech Republic *Bistatic radar *Cassette Scandal *Leonid Kuchma *Military of Ukraine *ELINT\\\\ESM *Multinational force in Iraq *Ukrainian Ground Forces *VERA ‚Äì a similar system using multilateration developed in the Czech Republic *High-frequency direction finding - a similar system used by the English during world war 2 to find German submarines. ==References== * Category:Military equipment of the Soviet Union Category:Military equipment of Ukraine Category:Radiofrequency receivers Category:Economy of Donetsk ","title":"Kolchuga passive sensor"},{"id":"1296445","text":"Dr. Julius No is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1958 James Bond novel and its 1962 film adaptation Dr. No, the first of the series, in which he was portrayed by actor Joseph Wiseman. ==Novel biography== The novel explains that Dr. No was born in Peking to a German Methodist missionary and a Chinese girl, but was raised by his aunt. As an adult, he went to Shanghai, where he was involved with the Tongs, a Chinese crime syndicate. Later he was smuggled to the United States and settled in New York City, where he became a clerk and eventually Treasurer for a Tong in America, called the \\"Hip-Sings\\". In the late 1920s, a mob war broke out in New York, forcing the police to crack down on them. No stole a million dollars in gold from the Tongs and disappeared. But the Tongs tracked him down and tortured him to find the location of the gold. When No refused to tell them, the Tongs cut off his hands, shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead. No survived, due to a condition called dextrocardia, in which his heart is on the right side of the body. No spent a long time in hospital, then enrolled in medical school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He adopted the title of Doctor and changed his name to Julius No, symbolic of his rejection of his father, whose given name was Julius. As in the film, No fits himself with metal manual prostheses, but the book describes them as simple pincers. In physical appearance, Dr. No is tall and very thin. He is described as being at least 6 inches taller than Bond, who is six feet tall, meaning that he's probably around 6 ft 6 inches (198 cm) in height. His head is said to be shaped like a \\"reverse oil drop\\", due to his round head, pointed chin and the yellowish tinge of his skin. He also mentions that while in school, he did not make use of his metal hands, replacing them with waxen ones which were less useful but gave himself a more human appearance. In the novel he wears a gunmetal coloured kimono; due to his inability to hold a bell, he uses a walkie-talkie which he carries around his neck. He also wears one of the first ever pair of contact lenses, and has had a lip slice cosmetic surgery, as well as wearing stocked shoes in order to make himself taller. All of these factors were employed by No to conceal his identity from the Tongs. With the million dollars from the Tong, he purchases rare stamps in order to preserve his money against inflation; he later purchases the island of Crab Key, off the coast of Jamaica, where he restarts a defunct guano business as a cover for his criminal operations. He employs Jamaican and Cuban laborers for his guano business, which is a mixed blessing for them. The workers are brutally supervised by Jamaican \\"Chigroes\\" (a portmanteau of 'Chinese' + 'Negroes', referring to their mixed ancestry), however they are paid good wages and given decent accommodations. No one who comes to the island is allowed to leave. No, with aid from the Soviets, sabotages the nearby tests of American missiles by jamming their signals and making them land and explode on a different target than that planned. This forces the Americans to spend time and money redesigning their missiles. He also recovers unexploded missiles from the ocean and turns them over to the Russians. No also admits there is more to play than the shopworn East-West rivalry; his intent is to create enmity between the USSR and USA in an attempt to make the Cold War hot. This was further revealed in Ernst Stavro Blofeld's master plan using the \\"three fighting fish\\" as an analogy; when the Cold War ended, SPECTRE would then engage in sabotage and subversion against the victor, now weakened from the war. Bond does not actually learn of No's plot until he and Quarrel‚Äîwith Honey Rider, who would trespass to find shells‚Äîhad infiltrated Crab Key and been captured. Bond had gone there after Commander Strangways had disappeared, murdered by No's henchmen. Bond eventually kills No by suffocating him in a mound of guano. ===Henchmen in the novel=== *Miss Taro *Miss Chung *Sister Rose *May *Riker *Other various \\"Chigroes\\" *The Three Blind Mice ==Film biography== Dr. No is a brilliant scientist with an implied Napoleon complex, and an example of the mad scientist trope. He is a self-described \\"unwanted child of a German missionary and a Chinese girl of a good family\\". He later \\"became treasurer of the most powerful criminal society in China\\"; in this case, the Tongs. He then \\"escaped to America with $10,000,000\\" of Tong gold bullion. He specialized in radiation, which cost him both of his hands; they were replaced with crude bionic metal ones. No's hands have great strength (he can crush a metal figurine with them) but are lacking in manual dexterity which leads to his demise. He offered his skills and expertise to the Americans, and then the Soviets, but was rejected by both superpowers. To get revenge, No joined the criminal organization SPECTRE and relocated to his island in Crab Key in Jamaica. When Bond is sent to investigate the murder of two British agents and any possible connection with recent rocket disasters, No orders several attempts on 007's life. He is particularly displeased with henchman Professor Dent's failures, such as through the chauffeur Jones. He gives Dent a venomous spider, which is released in Bond's room whilst he sleeps; however, Bond wakes up, kills it, and lures Dent to a private house, where Dent is interrogated and then shot twice by Bond. No fails in his own attempts to kill Bond; first, inadvertently, by locking him in a ventilation shaft, which is variously heated and filled with water; and then, deliberately, by beating him with his metal hands. No captures Bond and Honey Rider when they trespass on his island, and they are put through a decontamination shower since No's henchmen detected radiation on them. Inviting them to dinner at his private apartment, he offers Bond a position in his organization, but Bond refuses. Bond escapes through a ventilation shaft (and avoiding the obstacles of heat and flooding), and disguises himself with a radiation suit. Bond enters the control area where No and his assistants are preparing to disrupt the launch of an American rocket. Bond sabotages No's swimming pool reactor, allowing the American missile to launch successfully while No and most of his henchmen do not understand it. When No observes Bond's sabotage, the two men fight while the personnel flees the imminent explosion. They fall onto a small platform that slowly descends into the boiling coolant of the overheating reactor. Bond manages to climb out, but No cannot get a grip on the metal framework, due to his metal hands, and is poached alive. Bond frees Honey from where she has been chained in a room filling with water, and escapes before the reactor explodes. SPECTRE learned of the death of Dr. No and they vowed revenge on James Bond, which lead to the events in From Russia with Love. This also set the events of James Bond battling SPECTRE in the future films. ===Henchmen in the film=== *Miss Taro - arrested *Professor Dent - shot by Bond *Freelance, the photographer - survived *Mr. Jones - poisoned himself with a cyanide laced cigarette *The Three Blind Mice - killed in fiery crash when their hearse plunged off a cliff *Sister Rose *Sister Lily *Jamaican guards ==Other appearances== Dr. No as seen in the James Bond Jr. animated series. Dr. No made several appearances in the cartoon series James Bond Jr.. His skin, however, was rendered bright green similar to the Mandarin in Iron Man possibly due to the chemicals he was exposed to in the film. Julius No also appeared in the video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (almost-completely unrelated, especially in the meaning of the title, to the 1995 film) voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Despite his death in both the book and film, he appears alongside fellow enemies Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Auric Goldfinger, Francisco Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. In the game, Xenia Onatopp works for No and he seems to possess a considerable army of well- equipped henchmen as well as numerous tanks and helicopter gunships that resemble V-22 Ospreys. He also seems to have soldiers placed on countless rooftops and buildings in Hong Kong. He is electrocuted by his own reactor in a fight with the rogue 00 agent \\"GoldenEye\\". Julius No is also a multiplayer character in the video game 007: From Russia with Love and is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 video game GoldenEye 007 for the Wii. The character of Dr. No makes a brief appearance in a 2012 Heineken beer commercial to promote the release of the twenty-third Bond film, Skyfall. ===Non-official James Bond media=== In Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton Universe (Win Scott Eckert, ed., MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), Win Scott Eckert contributes \\"Who's Going to Take Over the World When I'm Gone?\\" wherein he posits that No's mother was an agent of Fu Manchu named Madame de Medici, who was in turn the daughter of Fu Xi, from Sax Rohmer's novel The Golden Scorpion. Likewise in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, No is stated as being a distant relative of Fu Manchu. Later in the book, it is revealed that Bond's mission to stop Dr. No was a fraud, an alibi for Bond to kill a British leader for the Americans ‚Äî \\"There was No Doctor.\\" In the alternate history novel Dracula Cha Cha Cha, Dr. No (along with Mr. Big) is mentioned as being vampire elders killed and drained by the Diogenes Club agent Hamish Bond. ==Cultural references== During the 1981 Ontario general election Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis mocked the Liberal leader Dr. Stuart Smith and his critical attitude towards the government by calling him \\"Dr. No\\". \\"Dr. No\\" was also used as the nickname of Northern Irish unionist politician Ian Paisley, due to his long-standing opposition to making concessions to Northern Ireland's Catholic community and to Irish nationalism. Similarly, American Republican politician and physician Tom Coburn was also known as \\"Dr. No\\" for his frequent opposition to legislation in the United States Congress, particularly bills which would increase federal spending. This nickname was also given to Representative Ron Paul for voting similarly against many bills, as well as his background as a medical doctor. ===Parodies=== *In a nod to this character, the master villain of the 1967 Bond spoof Casino Royale is named \\"Dr. Noah\\". *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine features a parodic villain named \\"Dr. Noah\\" in the episode \\"Our Man Bashir\\". *The television series Get Smart featured part Chinese villains named \\"Dr Yes\\" (with unusually long, sharp fingernails, at least one of which is lethally envenomed) and \\"The Claw\\" (with a magnetic claw in place of one hand). *Doctor Claw appears as the perennial villain in the Inspector Gadget series. *Dr. No also has made appearances in Auckland University Students' Association election campaigns, as a face for the 'no confidence' vote. *Lego Agents main villain \\"Dr. Inferno\\" is a parody of Dr. No. *Austin Powers series main antagonist Dr. Evil is a parody of several Bond villains, including Julius No. *The 1964 Flintstones episode \\"Dr. Sinister\\" features a character named \\"Madam Yes\\", a parody of Dr. No. *In an episode of the animated series The Fairly OddParents, Schnozmo must regain his brother Comso's trust by \\"saving\\" him from the evil Dr. Maybe. *The main antagonist of the James Pond franchise is named Dr. Maybe. *The main antagonist of the Operation Stealth video game (released as James Bond: The Stealth Affair in the U.S.) is named Dr. Why. ==References== Category:Bond villains Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century Category:Dr. No (film) Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:Fictional amputees Category:Literary characters introduced in 1958 Category:Fictional Chinese people Category:Fictional German people Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Male literary villains Category:Male characters in film Category:Fictional terrorists Category:Male film villains Category:Action film villains ","title":"Julius No"},{"id":"1296456","text":"Herta-Maria Perschy (23 September 1938 ‚Äì 3 December 2004) was an Austrian actress whose career included performances on screen with actor Rock Hudson and on American television in both daytime and prime time.Johnson, Sabrina. \\"An afternoon of cinema commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force\\".

Her first major success came with Nasser Asphalt where she played together with Horst Buchholz. Her acting career would eventually take her -- by way of France, Italy and Great Britain -- to Hollywood. Perschy played in a number of American films, her most notable roles being in the 1962 biopic Freud, the 1964 Rock Hudson comedy, Man's Favorite Sport?, and the 1964 hit war movie 633 Squadron. Perschy's career in America eventually declined and by the late 1970s her only US appearances were brief roles in TV shows such as Hawaii Five-O and General Hospital. While shooting in Spain in 1971, Perschy suffered a burn injury from an accident that required several operations before she could resume her career. Perschy returned to her native Austria in 1985 and continued to perform in a series of plays and TV series. In 1972, she filmed Castle of Fu Manchu with Christopher Lee and Richard Greene.

Bush (Supreme Court of Ohio Case Nos. 04-2055 and 04-2088) was a lawsuit filed by 37 Ohio voters challenging Ohio's certified electoral college votes in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. It was filed on 13 December 2004, and dismissed at the plaintiffs' request following the acceptance of Ohio's votes by the U.S. Congress and Senate on January 6, 2005. The suit was headed by Cliff Arnebeck of the Alliance for Democracy. Following the dismissal, Arnebeck's group filed a motion to intervene in a federal case brought on Election Day by the Ohio Democratic Party against Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell.http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/OhioDems/OD20.pdf That motion was opposed by the Ohio Democratic Partyhttp://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/OhioDems/OD21.pdf and ultimately denied.http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/OhioDems/order82605a.pdf ==Details of the case== The case challenged Ohio's certification of its electoral votes, which had been awarded to George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, the candidates on the Republican Party ticket. The plaintiffs alleged that there had been widespread systematic election fraud that altered the outcome of the election. On that basis, the suit asked the courts to set aside the certified results, and, possibly, award the state's electoral votes to John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, the candidates on the Democratic Party ticket. If successful, shifting Ohio's 20 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election would have had the effect of shifting the overall election from Bush to Kerry. The case was ultimately dismissed.See generally 2004 United States presidential election, results. ===Litigation=== Following the November election, Ohio's electors were scheduled to meet and cast their votes for President Bush on 13 December 2004. On that same day, various Ohio citizens (the \\"Contestors\\") filed an Election Contest Petitionhttp://freepress.org/images/departments/Election_Contest_1.pdf alleging fraud in the conduct of the Ohio election and a Motion for Temporary restraining order and Preliminary injunctionhttp://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/ohio/MossvBush/TRO.pdf seeking to prevent Ohio's electors from meeting or casting their vote before completion of the Election Contest. On 16 December 2005, Justices' Thomas Moyer and Maureen O'Connell, in separate opinions, dismissed Moss v. Bush I without prejudice to refiling the action as two separate cases. Both Justice Moyer and Justice O'Connell ruled that Ohio election law did not permit Contestors to challenge the election of two different officials in a single Petition.Moss v. Bush On 17 December, the case was refiled, with it now referring only to the election of Ohio's electors for the presidential electoral college. A request was also made that the Court declare the Kerry- Edwards presidential ticket the rightful winner of Ohio's electoral votes. On 12 January 2005, Moss v. Bush was dismissed at the contestors' request. ===Motion for sanctions=== On 18 January 2005, Ohio's Secretary of State filed a motion for sanction against the plaintiffs, alleging that the claim in Moss v. Bush was meritless, did not meet the standards of evidence required by law, and was brought only for partisan political purposes.http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/ohio/MossvBush/AGSanctionsMotion.pdf On 19 May 2005, Chief Justice Moyer denied the motion for sanctions. Justice Moyer concluded that, although \\"[t]he contestors indeed made multiple allegations in the complaint that are, at best, highly improbable and potentially defamatory, inflammatory, and devoid of logic\\" (Paragraph 4), and \\"[d]espite the apparently scurrilous nature of most of these allegations,\\" (Paragraph 16), sanctions were not appropriate under Ohio law for two reasons. First, Justice Moyer concluded that unlike civil litigation, the election contest statutes of Ohio do not permit sanctions for meritless charges. (Paragraphs 17-24). Second, because the contestors dismissed their suit before evidence was gathered, Justice Moyer concluded that even if sanctions were permitted by law, there was not enough evidence before the Court to issue sanctions. (Paragraph 25). ===Moss v. Moyer=== On 20 December 2004, the case contesting \\"...the certification of the election of Thomas Moyer for the office of Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court for the term commencing in 2005.\\" was refiled. The case is known as Moss v. Moyer, Ohio Supreme Court Case No. 04-2106. Justice Maureen O'Connor was designated to preside over the matter by Governor Bob Taft. On 28 December 2004, Justice O'Connor issued an order stating that under Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), the Contestors were required to plead the alleged acts of fraud in the election for Chief Justice with greater particularity. She ordered that Contestors do so by 7 January 2005, allowed their opponents until 14 January 2005 to respond, and stayed any discovery proceeding pending those pleadings. On 12 January 2005, Moss v. Moyer was dismissed at the request of the Contestors. ==References== == Other litigation documents == ===Moss v. Bush=== *Moss v. Bush I case docket *Moss v.

He was the younger brother of Francis Horner. Horner was a founder of the School of Arts of Edinburgh, now Heriot-Watt University and one of the founders of the Edinburgh Academy. A 'radical educational reformer' he was involved in the establishment of University College School. As a commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children in Factories, Horner arguably did more to improve the working conditions of women and children in North England than any other person in the 19th century.Early history of The Edinburgh Academy O'Farrell, Patrick N. 2010. Leonard Horner: Pioneering Reformer. Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. ==Early life and education== His father, John Horner, was a linen merchant in Edinburgh, and partner in the firm of Inglis & Horner.Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh vol II p.379 Leonard, the third and youngest son, attended the High School and entered the University of Edinburgh in 1799. There in the course of the next four years he studied chemistry and mineralogy, and gained a love of geology from Playfairs Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory. At the age of nineteen he became a partner in a branch of his father's business, and went to London. ==Career== In 1808 he joined the newly formed Geological Society of London and two years later was elected one of the secretaries. Throughout his long life he was ardently devoted to the welfare of the society; he was elected president in 1846 and again in 1860. In 1811 he read his first paper On the Mineralogy of the Malvern Hills (Trans. Geol. Soc. vol. i.) and subsequently communicated other papers on the Brine-springs at Droitwich, and the Geology of the S.W. part of Somersetshire. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1813. In 1815 he returned to Edinburgh to take personal superintendence of his business, and while there (1821) he was instrumental in founding the Edinburgh School of Arts 101 the instruction of mechanics, and he was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Academy. In 1827 he was invited to London to become warden of London University (now University College London), an office which he held for four years; he then resided at Bonn for two years and pursued the study of minerals and rocks, communicating to the Geological Society on his return a paper on the Geology of the Environs of Bonn, and another On the Quantity of Solid Matter suspended in the Water of the Rhine. In 1828 he returned to Edinburgh to take charge of his ailing father's company. In 1829, on the death of his father, he took full charge of the company, and continued in this role until 1833. In 1833 he was appointed one of the commissioners to inquire into the employment of children in the factories of Great Britain, and he was subsequently selected as one of the inspectors. He held this post for 26 years and during this time arguably did more to improve the working condition of women and children in the mills of north England than any other person in the 19th-century and for which he was praised by Karl Marx in Capital. In later years he devoted much attention to the geological history of the alluvial lands of Egypt; and in 1843 he published his Life of his brother Francis. ==Family== Horner married Anna Susanna Lloyd, daughter of Gamaliel Lloyd.https://www.geni.com/people/Leonard-Horner/6000000001779983778 They had six daughters, who were all educated to a high standard for the age. The eldest sister, Mary Elizabeth, married Sir Charles Lyell, author of The Principles of Geology in 1832. Her younger sister Katharine married Lyell's younger brother Henry in 1848, and later edited The Life, Letters and Journals of Sir Charles Lyell. A third daughter, Frances, married Charles Bunbury, a noted paleobotanist. A fourth daughter, Leonora, married Georg Heinrich Pertz, a historian and archivist; one of their children was Dorothea Pertz and through this connection Horner was the step-great-great-grandfather of astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. Two other daughters, Susan and Joanna, did not marry but were known in their day as the authors of a book on walking tours of Florence, Italy.Payne-Gaposchkin, Cecilia, and Katherine Haramundanis.

It was built in 1999 by a group including Chip Ganassi, owner of Chip Ganassi Racing. In 2002 the oval shaped track suspended operations due to financial conditions in the motorsports industry. The track was also the site of horse races, for which the track was called \\"Sportsman's Park\\". The track was one of two racetracks that hosted both NASCAR auto races and horse races (the other is Dover International Speedway). ==History== Before 1999, the Sportsman's Park was one of the premier locations for horse racing in the area. Hawthorne Race Course, located right across the street to the south from the track, is the current host of the Illinois Derby. The two tracks operated together for decades. In 1999, after the final season of the old Sportsman's Park, the main grandstand and infield were completely demolished to make way for the massive grandstand that was to follow. The track held CART races from 1999‚Äì2002, the Toyota Atlantic Series, and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races in 2000 and 2001. Chicago Motor Speedway also held American Speed Association (ASA) races. Traditional horse races remained; this time as dirt was brought in over the racing surface. Problems with the hard surface led to several scratches by trainers and races being cancelled. In 2001, Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet was built in the hopes of attracting more racing fans and upper-level races; all Cicero races were subsequently moved to Joliet and the track closed the following year after the CART event. The few remaining horse races were transferred to Hawthorne. Portions of the motion picture Driven were shot at Chicago Motor Speedway. In 2003 the town of Cicero purchased the track for $18 million. During 2005 the main grandstands were torn down but the track itself remained. Aerial view of the speedway, after demolition of the grandstand, 2007. On October 31, 2008 it was reported that contracts for the demolition of the remaining structures and track had been awarded. Demolition of the remaining Sportsman's Park structures and the track itself began January 5, 2009. The western portion of the site is now a Wirtz Beverage Group distribution center, while the eastern portion is home to a Walmart supercenter effectively removing any last remains of the track.

Common names include chiltepin, Indian pepper, chiltepe, and chile tepin, as well as turkey, bird‚Äôs eye, or simply bird peppers, due to their consumption and spread by wild birds. Tepin is derived from a Nahuatl word meaning \\"flea\\". This variety is the most likely progenitor of the domesticated C. annuum var. annuum. Another similar-sized pepper 'Pequin' (also called 'Piquin') is often confused, the Tepin fruit is round to oval and the Pequin is oval with a point, and the leaves, stems and plant structure are very different on each plant. ==Description== Chiltepin is a perennial shrub that usually grows to a height of around , but sometimes reaches . and in areas without hard frost in winter, plants can live 35‚Äì50 years. ===Fruit=== File:Chiltepin Cluster.pngCluster of 18 intertwined plants File:Capsicum annuum chiltepin dried.jpgCapsicum annuum chiltepin dried The tiny chili peppers of C. a. var. glabriusculum are red to orange-red, usually slightly ellipsoidal, and about in diameter. Some strains of tepin peppers are much closer to perfectly round when fresh. If a tepin pepper is dried, it appears quite round even if it was slightly ellipsoidal when fresh. Tepin peppers are very hot, measuring between 50,000 and 1,628,000 Scoville units. The tepin can be hotter than the habanero or red savina, with the highest levels seen in green fruit 40-50 days after fruit set. However, since this pepper is harvested from wild stands in the Mexican desert, the heat level of the fruit can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the amount of natural rainfall that occurs during the time the fruits are forming. During drought years, fruit heat levels can be weak, and during normal rainfall years, the highest heat levels are produced. Also there is a large variation between the heat levels of the green fresh fruit (which are pickled in vinegar), red-ripe fresh fruit, dried whole fruit and dried fruit with the seeds removed, and their heat levels are arranged from mildest to hottest in that order. Around 50 tons are estimated to be harvested commercially annually in Mexico, primarily in Sonora. In Mexico, the heat of the chiltepin is called arrebatado (\\"rapid\\" or \\"violent\\"), because, while the heat is intense, it is not very enduring. This stands in contrast to the domesticated 'Pequin' variety, which is the same size as the wild tepin, but is oval-shaped, and delivers a decidedly different experience. The different drying methods used for the tepin and 'Pequin', can help tell these peppers apart. Tepins are always sun-dried, whereas the Pequins are commonly dried over wood smoke, and the smell of the smoke in the Pequins can help separate the two varieties. Pequins are not as hot as chiltepins (only about 30,000‚Äì50,000 Scoville units), but they have a much slower and longer-lasting effect. ==Habitat and range== C. a. var. glabriusculum can be found in Texas, Arizona, and Florida in the Southern United States, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. It prefers well-drained soils, such as silty or sandy loams, and of annual precipitation in Puerto Rico. It may be found in areas with a broken forest canopy or disturbed areas that lack tree cover if moisture and soil are favorable. Elsewhere, such as in Arizona, it may require the partial shading of a nurse plant. ==Symbolism== Chiltepin was named \\"the official native pepper of Texas\\" in 1997, two years after the jalape√±o became the official pepper of Texas. ==Conservation== In 1999, Native Seeds/SEARCH and the United States Forest Service established the Wild Chile Botanical Area in the Coronado National Forest. Located in the Rock Corral Canyon near Tumacacori, Arizona, the preserve protects a large C. a. var. glabriusculum population for study and as a genetic reserve. ==See also== *List of Capsicum cultivars *Capsicum annuum *Capsicum ==Notes== ==External links== * Tepin, in What Am I Eating?

Gabriel began his music career when he launched a demo tape containing the song \\"T√¥ Feliz (Matei o Presidente)\\" I'm Happy (I killed the President) landing him a contract with Sony Music. Since then he has released eight albums: Ainda √â S√≥ o Come√ßo, Quebra-Cabe√ßa, N√°degas a Declarar, Gabriel o Pensador, Seja Voc√™ Mesmo (mas n√£o Seja sempre o Mesmo), MTV ao Vivo, Cavaleiro Andante and Sem Crise (this last one was released independently). Gabriel has also written three books: \\"Di√°rio Noturno\\", \\"Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto\\" and \\"Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro\\". \\"Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto\\" won the \\"Pr√™mio Jabuti\\", for best Children's literature. ==Biography== Coming from a middle-class family, a unique background among Brazilian rappers, Gabriel, the son of a well known journalist in Brazil, hit fame in 1992 with the song \\"T√¥ Feliz (Matei o Presidente)\\" (\\"I'm happy, I've killed the president\\"), the debut single from his first and eponymous album. This song was written in protest of President Fernando Collor de Mello and his corrupt administration. Gabriel's mother was Collor's press secretary.Gabriel o Pensador The same album also yielded other hits, including \\"L√¥rab√∫rra\\" (\\"Dumb Blonde\\", shortened) and \\"Retrato de um Playboy\\" (\\"Portrait of a Playboy\\"), bringing hip hop mainstream attention in Brazil by catering to the middle class. Although rapping about everyday life, Gabriel also found time to talk about social injustices with his fourth single, \\"O Resto do Mundo\\" (\\"The Leftovers of the World\\", a pun on the word for \\"leftovers\\" and \\"rest\\" being the same in Portuguese), a more downbeat track about homeless life, with a purposefully depressive melody and flow. Gabriel was \\"notorious for his biting attacks on some of the major ills of Brazilian society: poverty, racism, violence.\\"Behague, Gerard. \\"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985‚Äì95).\\" Latin American Music Review 27, no.1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79‚Äì90. His following albums were also commercially successful, with a careful blend of socially relevant tracks mixed with airwave-minded pop anthems. His third album, Quebra-Cabe√ßa, was released in 1997 and sold over one million copies. History-minded, Gabriel was highly influenced by other Brazilian music, including bossa nova, samba and MPB, as well as using hip hop's traditional methods of sampling jazz, funk and disco (\\"2345meia78\\", for example, sampled Chic's \\"Good Times\\"). In 1994, while touring in Portugal, Gabriel's song \\"Lavagem Cerebral\\" (Brainwashing) was received with much praise. The piece was accepted as \\"a strong social critique of Brazilian society and of the ideology of the dominating classes.\\" Besides his native Brazil, Gabriel, o Pensador is also well known in other Lusophone countries such as Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, and has worked with Portuguese musicians like S√©rgio Godinho and General D. In 2004, he recorded his first song in English entitled, Who's The Enemy?, that appeared on American rapper Ithaka's album, Fishdaddy Flashbacks.{{cite weburl=/ITHAKA-Gabriel-O-Pensador-Whos-The- Enemy-15th-Anniversary-Remastered-Edition/release/13651655title=Who's The Enemy?publisher=Discogs.com ===Other projects=== The musician has also released three books: \\"Di√°rio Noturno\\" (Brazil and Portugal; poems and short stories), \\"Um garoto chamado Rorbeto\\" (Brazil; fiction poetry for children) \\"Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro\\" (Brazil; about children who support Flamengo, like himself).

The organization offers tutoring and courses for a group of underprivileged children in the Rocinha district, located in Gabriel's hometown of Rio de Janeiro, where he still lives in today. Gabriel is also a member of the Dreams Can Be Foundation, a nonprofit charitable supporting organization and a Brazilian NGO dedicated to aiding street children and impoverished youth in Brazil, working in partnership with local organizations and NGOs to provide: education, moral and social development, humanitarian relief, and the offering of opportunities where there were none before. ==Discography== ;Studio Albums {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" - !

Near the end of World War II, his family fled Estonia and Lasn spent some time in a German refugee camp. At age seven he was resettled in Australia with his family, where he grew up and remained until the late 1960s, attending school in Canberra. In the late 1960s, he founded a market research company in Tokyo, and in 1970, moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Over the course of twenty years, he produced documentaries for PBS and Canada‚Äôs National Film Board. He currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is the co-founder of Adbusters magazine and author of the books Culture Jam and Design Anarchy and is the co- founder of the Adbusters Media Foundation, which owns the magazine. He reportedly started Adbusters after an epiphany that there was something profoundly wrong with consumerism. It happened in a supermarket parking lot. Frustrated that he had to insert a quarter to use a shopping cart, he jammed a bent coin in so that the machine became inoperable. This act of vandalism was his first (quite literal) \\"culture jam\\"‚Äîdefined as an act designed to subvert mainstream society.Kalle Lasn, Culture Jam, Harpers Collins, 1999, page xv ==Life and work== Born in Tallinn, Estonia, during World War II, Lasn spent his early childhood residing in a \\"displaced-persons camp\\", and eventually resettled in Australia to pursue a degree in applied mathematics. Soon after, Lasn relocated to Tokyo, where he spent five years running his own market- research firm before eventually immigrating to Canada in 1970. Lasn‚Äôs life works are applied within the philosophical lens of the French Situationists theory and the philosophy of detournement. His concept pertained to the \\"rerouting [of] spectacular images, environments, ambiences and events to reverse or subvert their meaning.\\" Lasn has also contemporized the concept of the Spectacle, in which he applies to explain the thousands of images encountered by consumers on a daily basis.\\"WHEN A BRAND BUSTER BECOMES A BRAND. Advertising Age, 78(47), 1-1,29 In an interview with PRWeek magazine, Lasn recalls the moment in 1989, as an environmental campaigner, where he realized that all brands carry a \\"political message\\". In response to a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign launched by the forest industry, which sought to reassure the Pacific Northwest that they had nothing to worry about, Lasn and his team developed a 30second advertisement of their own which would challenge the initial campaign. However, Lasn‚Äôs attempt at airing the spot on television ultimately failed, as the TV station refused to sell him any time. Lasn referred to this move as \\"absurd and unfair\\" because \\"even the most innocuous product ad is laden with unspoken and unquestioned political assumptions\\", adding that no line exists between product and advocacy ads, and that all ads are political.\\"The Interview: Kalle Lasn - Power in your hands\\", PR Week, UK, 1 Sept. 2014, p. 26. Business Collection ===Adbusters=== Inspired by what he saw as the lack of democracy in access to all-power media, Lasn founded Adbusters, a bi-monthly radicalizing magazine which lends itself the title of one of the leading voices in global environmentalism, anti-capitalist and anti-consumerist movements. Having worked in market research in Japan in the 1960s, Lasn drew from his personal experience and knowledge to produce publications and campaigns that would employ the necessary tools and techniques to create powerful imagery, stunts, slick graphics and vibrant language to promote his cause. By taking conventional marketing communication techniques and applying them to anti-consumerism messages, Adbusters has created a powerful, global social movement, which takes aim at large-scale industries. Although the company‚Äôs headquarters in Vancouver only has ten employees, it has a large global following, with 40,000 paper subscribers and 30,000 online subscribers. Lasn claims that ‚Äò‚ÄôAdbusters\\" is the \\"hub of global activism ‚Äì it‚Äôs the (communication) model of the future\\". ==Books and films== In his first book, Culture Jam, Lasn portrays consumerism as the fundamental evil of the modern era. He calls for a \\"meme war\\": a battle of ideas to shift Western society away from consumer capitalism. Lasn, in his book, calls on the values of authenticity, individuality and freedom of expression. He promotes the rebelling of the notion that hierarchies can dictate people‚Äôs identities. Essentially, Lasn‚Äôs concept of culture jamming calls upon consumers to value experiences over possessions, while accusing marketing experts of co-opting these values and \\"slapping a brand name on them\\".Goldman, Debra. \\"Consumer Republic.\\" ADWEEK Western Edition 22 Nov. 1999: 13. Academic OneFile. Web. 9 Mar. 2017 His second book, Design Anarchy, calls on graphic designers, illustrators and others to turn from working in service to corporate and political pollution of both the planet and \\"the mental environment\\", and to embrace a radical new aesthetic devoted to social and environmental responsibility.. The book, which in an introduction to Lasn‚Äôs notion of culture jamming, includes a compilation of some of Adbuster‚Äôs greatest moments, but with the addition of what Lasn calls a \\"technical event\\", which forces the mind to take notice of something and search for meaning, even if there is no meaning. This \\"technical event\\" invites readers to become mindful of their patterns of consumption. Similar to Lasn‚Äôs prior book, Design Anarchy is a \\"personal statement, manifesto and textbook\\", which takes many of the prominent advertising campaigns found in the Adbusters magazine, and reconfigures them to stop \\"the flow of bits of information long enough to interrupt the spectacle, to promote the jolt, to allow the process of awareness\\". In the book, Lasn claims that if members of a society can begin by demarking themselves, then they are able to de-market certain rituals imposed by commercial forces, consequently shifting the ways in which the customer interacts with mass media, the way information flows, and the ways in which meaning is produced, ultimately leading to a break in commercial meaning and a shift to a post-consumerist society.Barber, John F. ‚ÄúLeonardo.‚Äù Leonardo, vol. 41, no. 2, 2008, pp. 193‚Äì194 In his third book, Meme Wars: The Creative Destruction of Neoclassic Economics, Lasn prefaces the book by calling on University students to realize that they are being \\"fooled by the fa√ßade\\" of the capitalist educational system, adding that the lack of incorporation of externalities such as species extinction, resource depletion, climate change, and financial meltdowns has turned the profession into a \\"target for derision and ridicule\\". Lasn challenges students to look beneath the surface of the fa√ßade to realize that economics is a \\"highly contested\\" and \\"questionable\\" field. To do so, Lasn offers two distinct ways for students to approach their academic endeavours: to either \\"accept the status quo\\" of the system, or become \\"an agitator, a provocateur, a meme warrior, and occupier\\", calling on students to engage in a paradigm shift within educational institutions. The book includes a series of essays, photographs and advertisements, which support Lasn‚Äôs approach to culture jamming.Kalle Lasn, \\"Meme Wars: The Neoclassic Economics, A real world economics textbook\\".

Horse racing in the Chicago region has been a popular sport since the early days of the city in the 1830s, and at one time Chicago had more horse racing tracks (six) than any other major metropolitan area. Arlington International was the site of the first thoroughbred race with a million-dollar purse in 1981. It is located near the Illinois Route 53 expressway. It was serviced by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. The premier event at Arlington Park is the International Festival of Racing, held in early August, which features three Grade 1 races on turf: the Arlington Million Stakes, Beverly D. Stakes and Secretariat Stakes. ==History== The grandstand at Arlington International Racecourse, Arlington Heights, Illinois Arlington International Racecourse was founded as Arlington Park by California businessman Harry D. \\"Curly\\" Brown who would later serve as president of Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. The track officially opened in 1927 to 20,000 spectators. Jockey Joe Bollero, who later became a successful trainer, rode Luxembourg to victory in the first race ever run at Arlington. Benjamin F. Lindheimer acquired control of Arlington Park in 1940 and owned it until his death in 1960. Long involved with the business, adopted daughter Marje Lindheimer Everett then took over management of the racetrack. Widely respected Hall of Fame trainer Jimmy Jones of Calumet Farms was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying that Lindheimer \\"was the savior of Chicago racing\\" and that \\"Arlington Park became the finest track in the world‚Äîcertainly the finest I've ever been on.\\" On July 5, 1948, Citation won the Stars and Stripes Stakes in his first appearance since winning the Triple Crown. He equalled the track record at the time by winning in 1:49 1/5. On June 24, 1952, jockey Eddie Arcaro becomes the first American jockey to win 3,000 races. After 1955, seating capacity was increased to 30,000 and parking facilities expanded to accommodate 15,000. In 1960 a new paddock was unveiled. In 1964, Arlington Park inherits the thoroughbred race dates of Washington Park, who is now exclusively running harness races. In 1966, future Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay, Jr. gets his first American victory. In 1968, the future Hall of Famer Dr. Fager wins the one-mile Washington Park Handicap in world record time of 1:32 1/5. He carried 143 pounds and held that record until 1998. In 1968, Marje Everett sold the racetrack to Gulf & Western, remaining as director. In 1969, she was accused of bribing Illinois Governor Otto Kerner Jr.. The alleged bribes were in the form of stock options in 1961 that Kerner bought at a reduced price and then sold in 1968 at a profit. Kerner was eventually convicted of mail fraud, but Everett denied at trial that she intended to bribe him, and the government never identified her as a briber.Marje Everett dies at 90; legendary figure in horse racing - Bill Dwyre, Los Angeles Times, 24 March 2012 In June 1973, Arlington organized a race for 3-year-olds, the Arlington Invitational, to lure Secretariat to the mid-west. Secretariat won easily and Arlington created the Secretariat Stakes, also for 3-year-olds but on the turf, in his honor. In 1981 under the direction of track president Joseph Joyce Jr., Arlington was the home of the world's first million dollar thoroughbred race: The Arlington Million. The result of that race is immortalized in bronze at the top of the paddock at Arlington, where a statue of jockey Bill Shoemaker riding John Henry to a thrilling come-from-behind victory over 40-1 long shot The Bart celebrates Thoroughbred racing's inaugural million dollar race. Arlington entered a new era in 1983 when Richard L. Duchossois led an Illinois investment group to purchase the track from its former owners and made a pledge to continue presenting championship racing. That was tested on July 31, 1985, when a small fire spread quickly out of control and completely destroyed the grandstand and clubhouse. Unsure of the future of Arlington, the meet was moved to Hawthorne Race Course. Yet it was announced that the Arlington Million would still be held at Arlington International. On August 25, 1985, they did just that by using temporary bleachers. Joyce resigned in 1986 after disagreements with Duchossois.Arlington Park's top brass to resign The track fully reopened in 1989 under a new name, Arlington International Racecourse. In 1996, 34,000 fans jammed into Arlington to see the two-time Horse of the Year and future Hall of Famer Cigar tie the modern day record of 16 consecutive wins in the Arlington Citation Challenge. Due to contract disputes, Arlington went dark and had no racing in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Arlington reopened after a two-year shutdown. In September of that year, Churchill Downs Incorporated completed its purchase of the track. In 2001, Arlington reopened as Arlington Park but returned to Arlington International Racecourse in 2013. Racing on the polytrack at Arlington International Racecourse, on Memorial Day Weekend of year 2007 Arlington hosted the 2002 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships at their track. In 2007 to promote safer racing, Arlington International Racecourse invested $11 million to install a synthetic racing surface called Polytrack which is still used today. Do the Wave won the first race on the Polytrack on May 4. On May 11, Arlington debuts an alternate finish line at the 1/16 pole. In 2016, Arlington debuted the Arlington Racing Club, an ownership group with the goal to garner interest in thoroughbred ownership. === Reality Television === On May 14, 2010, Lee DeWyze, a citizen of Mount Prospect, Illinois, and a contestant on American Idol, performed a concert at Arlington Park for approximately 41,000 fans. Also on May 14, Arlington is featured in an episode of Undercover Boss where Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen goes to Arlington and Calder Race Course. A year later, on May 14, 2011, Haley Reinhart, of Wheeling, Illinois, also made the top 3 on American Idol. She, like DeWyze, had a hometown concert at the track for nearly 30,000 of her own fans and supporters. === Pioneers in Racing === Arlington was the first track to install a public-address system and employed the pioneering race caller Clem McCarthy to describe the action. It added the first electric totalizator which allowed a credible tote board and decreased time between races, in 1933. In 1936 it added a photo finish camera. It introduced the first electric starting gate in 1940 and the largest closed circuit TV system in all of sports in 1967. In 1971, Arlington held the industry's first commercially sponsored race‚Äîthe $100,000 Pontiac Grand Prix. On July 4, 1976, Arlington hosted the first races on a Sunday in Illinois. While Arlington is credited in some circles with the introduction of trifecta wagering in 1971, the New York Racing Association first offered the bet a year earlier as \\"The Triple\\". ==Physical attributes== The Arlington grandstands The track has a one-mile and one-eighth dirt oval and a one-mile turf oval. There is stabling on the backstretch for over 2,000 horses. Arlington replaced its dirt course with a synthetic track prior to the opening of the 2007 season. ==TV personalities== *Tony Cobitz (1990‚Äì91) *Caton Bredar (1988‚Äì1991) *Lynne Snierson (1992‚Äì1994) *Christine Gabriel (1995‚Äì1997, 2000‚Äì2005) *John G.

Secretum was not circulated until some time after Petrarch's death, and was probably meant to be a means of self-examination more than a work to be published and read by others. The dialogue opens with Augustine chastising Petrarch for ignoring his own mortality and his fate in the afterlife by not devoting himself fully to God. Petrarch concedes that this lack of piety is the source of his unhappiness, but he insists that he cannot overcome it. The dialogue then turns to the question of Petrarch's seeming lack of free will, and Augustine explains that it is his love for temporal things (specifically Laura), and his pursuit of fame through poetry that \\"bind his will in adamantine chains\\". Petrarch's turn towards religion in his later life was inspired in part by Augustine's Confessions, and Petrarch imitates Augustine's style of self- examination and harsh self-criticism in Secretum. The ideas expressed in the dialogues are taken mostly from Augustine, particularly the importance of free will in achieving faith. Other notable influences include Cicero and other Pre-Christian thinkers. Secretum can be seen as an attempt by Petrarch to reconcile his Renaissance humanism and admiration of the classical world with his Christian faith. Especially important are his rejection of love for temporal things not because it is a sin, but because it prevents him from knowing the eternal, a position that resembles classical philosophy far more than the contemporary Christian theology. Classical writers are also regarded as sources of authority supporting Christianity, and Secretum quotes them more frequently than scripture. ==List of authorities cited== *St. Augustine **Confessions *Cicero **Academica **De amicitia **De finibus bonorum et malorum **De Senectute **Epistulae ad Atticum **Pro Marcello **Tusculanae Disputationes *Horace **Epistles **Odes *Juvenal **Satires *Macrobius **Saturnalia *Ovid **Amores **Epistulae ex Ponto **Metamorphoses **Remedia Amoris *Petrarch **'Africa'' **Epistles **Penitential Psalms *Seneca the Elder **Declamations *Seneca the Younger **De Beneficiis **De Tranquillitate Animi **Epistles **Naturales quaestiones *Suetonius **De vita Caesarum *Terence **Andria **Eunuchus **Phormio *Virgil **Aeneid (26 times) **Eclogues **Georgics *Scripture **Book of Wisdom **Psalm 84 **Second Epistle to the Corinthians ==External links== *William H.

The ground was home to the minor league Minneapolis Millers of the Western League and later American Association from 1896 to 1955. The ballpark opened on June 20, 1896, with a 13-6 win over Milwaukee. The new grounds were first known as Wright Field, named for one of baseball's founding fathers, Harry Wright. Area newspapers had held a contest and chose that name over \\"Nicollet Park\\" among others, awarding season tickets to the winning entrants.[Minneapolis Star-Tribune, June 17, 1896, p.5] The papers acknowledged the built-in pun on \\"right field\\", and added to it by describing one hit in the opener as a home run \\"knocked by the right-fielder, across right field, out of Wright Field.\\" The club owners were not enamored of the name, and it was soon renamed \\"Nicollet Park\\", the name \\"Nicollet\\" being ubiquitous in Minneapolis then and now. The wooden ballpark was replaced by a steel and concrete structure in 1912. Lights were installed in 1937. The first night game was played on July 16, with the Millers hosting the arch-rival St. Paul Saints. The teams had also played the previous night, in Lexington Park's first night game. The ballpark was on a small block bounded by Nicollet Avenue on the east, 31st Street on the south, Blaisdell Avenue on the west and Lake Street (or 30th Street) on the north in the present-day Lyndale neighborhood. Home plate was in the southwest corner. A small ticket office building with a Spanish-style roof stood outside the right field corner, at the Nicollet-31st intersection. Joe Hauser hit 69 homers for the Millers in 1933. Ted Williams also made a bit of a splash here in 1938, on his way up to the major leagues, registering 43 round-trippers to lead the league. Willie Mays was enjoyed by the Minneapolis fans for only a month or so in 1951 before the parent club New York Giants brought the young ballplayer to the big leagues. Nicollet Park, which had opened with a big win 60 years earlier, went out with a bang in September 28, 1955, as the Millers won the American Association championship tournament, and then went on to vie for the Junior World Series championship, facing the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The series went the distance of 7 games, and the finale on September 28 was a close-fought win for the Millers in what was also the final game at Nicollet Park. In 1956 the Millers moved to Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Bloomington. The park also held early National Football League games as the Minneapolis Marines and Minneapolis Red Jackets played home games there during the 1920s. In 1944 the Minneapolis Millerettes of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League called Nicollet Park home. Nicollet Park was also the place that the cereal Wheaties was first advertised. Augsburg University's football team played their home games at Nicollet from 1946 to 1950. The New York Giants and Green Bay Packers played a preseason game on August 29, 1948 at Nicollet Park. The ballpark site's current occupants include a Wells Fargo Bank branch, built originally as a major branch for Norwest Bank. There is a plaque detailing the ballpark's history, near the drive-up window positioned near what was once the center field corner.

A PHY connects a link layer device (often called MAC as an acronym for medium access control) to a physical medium such as an optical fiber or copper cable. A PHY device typically includes both Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) and Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) layer functionality. -PHY may also be used as a suffix to form a short name referencing a specific physical layer protocol, for example M-PHY. == Ethernet physical transceiver == Micrel KS8721CL - 3.3V Single Power Supply 10/100BASE-TX/FX MII Physical Layer Transceiver The Ethernet PHY is a component that operates at the physical layer of the OSI network model. It implements the Ethernet physical layer portion of the 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 10BASE-T standards. A PHY chip (PHYceiver) is commonly found on Ethernet devices. Its purpose is to provide analog signal physical access to the link. It is usually with a Media Independent Interface (MII) interfaced to a MAC chip in a microcontroller or other system that takes care of the higher layer functions. More specifically, the Ethernet PHY is a chip that implements the hardware send and receive function of Ethernet frames; it interfaces between the analog domain of Ethernet's line modulation and the digital domain of link-layer packet signaling. The PHY usually does not handle MAC addressing, as that is the link layer's job. Similarly, Wake-on-LAN and Boot ROM functionality is implemented in the network interface card (NIC), which may have PHY, MAC, and other functionality integrated into one chip or as separate chips. Common ethernet interfaces include fiber, or two to four copper pairs for data communication. However, there now exists a new interface, called Single Pair Ethernet (SPE), which is able to utilize a single pair of copper wires while still communicating at the intended speeds. Texas Instruments DP83TD510E is an example of a PHY which uses SPE. Examples include the Microsemi SimpliPHY and SynchroPHY VSC82xx/84xx/85xx/86xx family, Marvell Alaska 88E1310/88E1310S/88E1318/88E1318S Gigabit Ethernet transceivers, Texas Instruments DP838xx family and offerings from IntelIntel PHY controllers brochure and ICS.osuosl.org - ICS1890 10Base-T/100Base-TX Integrated PHYceiver datasheet ==Other applications== * Wireless LAN or Wi-Fi: The PHY portion consists of the RF, mixed-signal and analog portions, that are often called transceivers, and the digital baseband portion that use digital signal processor (DSP) and communication algorithm processing, including channel codes. It is common that these PHY portions are integrated with the media access control (MAC) layer in system-on-a-chip (SOC) implementations. Similar wireless applications include 3G/4G/LTE, WiMAX and UWB. * Universal Serial Bus (USB): A PHY chip is integrated into most USB controllers in hosts or embedded systems and provides the bridge between the digital and modulated parts of the interface. * IrDA: The Infrared Data Association's (IrDA) specification includes an IrPHY specification for the physical layer of the data transport. * Serial ATA (SATA): Serial ATA controllers use a PHY. ==References== Category:Physical layer protocols Category:Integrated circuits it:Livello fisico ","title":"PHY"},{"id":"1296540","text":"Pasta al pomodoro () is an Italian food typically prepared with pasta, olive oil, fresh tomatoes, basil, and various other fresh ingredients.

It is responsible for non-degree, undergraduate, and graduate programs related to continuing education. ==Programs== Currently, the Division of Continuing Education comprises four major programs: # The Harvard Summer School # The Harvard Extension School # The Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement # The Harvard Secondary School Program The Harvard Summer School, founded in 1871, is the first academic summer session established in the United States. Each summer, more than 5,000 students of all ages come to Harvard from across the United States and more than 100 foreign countries to study for seven weeks with faculty from Harvard and other universities. The Summer School offers approximately 300 daytime and evening classes in more than forty disciplines. The Harvard Extension School, founded in 1910, offers online and on-campus education for nontraditional students through open-enrollment for individual courses, part- time day and evening classes, and opportunities for personal enrichment or career advancement. For students that are accepted through a formal admissions process, the school also offers the degrees of Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALB) and Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALM). The Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement, created in 1977, offers retirees and other older adults an opportunity to explore new areas of knowledge in peer-taught study groups. Each year, approximately 500 people ranging in age from their fifties to their nineties participate in the Institute's programs. Part of the Harvard Summer School, the Harvard Secondary School Program offers high school seniors, juniors, and sophomores a chance to sample college. Students take college classes taught by Harvard and non- Harvard faculty, meet students from around the world, and take part in social, recreational, and college preparatory activities: a college fair, trips to other colleges, intramural athletics, dances, a trivia bowl, music groups, and a talent show. ==Organization and faculty== The Division of Continuing Education is led by the Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension, who is appointed by and reports to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Dean of the Harvard Summer School reports to the Dean of Continuing Education.

He was the lead guitarist for the Los Angeles-based glam metal band Nitro in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Batio's work has encompassed many genres, but he is best known for playing heavy metal and its subgenres such as neoclassical metal, and speed metal. Batio has an advanced knowledge of music theory, having a deep understanding of complex scale combinations and time signatures which assist him in his compositions. He is widely known for his technical mastery of the fretboard and his extremely fast picking and sweep picked arpeggios. He is also known for his showmanship during performances, particularly his use of the \\"Over-Under\\" technique, and for his ability to play a double and quad guitar, using both hands to play. Batio is also noted for his guitar instruction DVDs in the \\"Speed Kills\\" series which teach shred guitar techniques and how to \\"master the art of playing lightning fast\\". Batio was voted the \\"No. 1 Fastest Guitar Shredder of All Time\\" by Guitar One Magazine in 2003. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Batio was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois to an Italian father and a German mother.Reffett, Dave (December 12, 2011). \\"Interview: Michael Angelo Batio Discusses Tone, Gear and His 'Speed Kills' DVD\\". Guitar World. NewBay Media. Retrieved 2014-10-28. He started playing the piano and composing music at the age of five, and first played guitar at the age of ten. By twelve he was playing in bands in youth clubs, churches, and shows, playing for 10‚Äì12 hours on the weekends. By the age of thirteen his guitar teacher told him, \\"I can't teach you any more. You're faster at thirteen than I was at 22.\\" He started listening to and watching professionals and sitting down and trying to work out riffs and tunes. He attended Northeastern Illinois University and achieved a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Theory and Composition. After he had graduated, Batio looked to become a session guitarist in his hometown. When he asked for a job at a nearby studio, he was given a piece of music and simply asked to play it. He managed to play it adding his own improvisations and fills, making him the studio's primary call-out guitarist. As a session player, Batio recorded music for such companies as Burger King, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, United Airlines, United Way, McDonald's, Beatrice Corp. and the Chicago Wolves hockey team. ===Holland, the Michael Angelo Band and Nitro (1984-1993)=== Batio began his recording career in 1984 when he joined new Chicago-based heavy metal band Holland, an eponymous project set up by ex- Steppenwolf singer Tommy Holland. With major label Atlantic Records, the band released their debut studio album in 1985 entitled Little Monsters, which saw moderate success in the United States. The band split up soon after, and a compilation of material from the Little Monsters sessions, Wake Up the Neighborhood, was released in 1999 through Batio's label M.A.C.E. Music. After the breakup of Holland, Batio started his own eponymous band with singer Michael Cordet, bassist Allen Hearn and drummer Paul Cammarata. The band did not release any albums, though three of their songs appeared on the 1998 Nitro compilation Gunnin' for Glory. In 1987, after the breakup of Holland, Batio joined glam metal artist Jim Gillette on his solo album Proud to Be Loud, before founding the band Nitro with bassist T.J. Racer and drummer Bobby Rock. In 1989 Nitro released their first studio album, O.F.R., from which they released two singles, \\"Freight Train\\" and \\"Long Way From Home\\". The music video for \\"Freight Train\\", which received much airplay on MTV, was notable for featuring Batio playing his now famous 'Quad Guitar', a notion which FHM magazine voted one of the \\"50 most outrageous moments in rock history\\". 1987 was also the year Batio released his first instructional video with \\"Star Licks Productions\\" as part of the \\"Masters Series\\" and was one of the first recognized metal guitarists to record instructional videos. This video was the very first \\"shred\\" instructional program showing many modern guitar concepts for the first time. By 1992, Comet and Racer had been replaced by Johnny Thunder and Ralph Carter respectively, and it was in this year that they released their second studio album entitled Nitro II: H.W.D.W.S.. Included on the album was a cover of Ted Nugent's \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\", which the band also integrated into a music video. Nitro disbanded shortly afterwards. ===Solo career (1993-present)=== In April 1993, Batio founded his own record label, M.A.C.E. Music, which became one of the first labels online in 1996. He used this label when he began recording his first album, No Boundaries, which he released in 1995. Batio's second studio release was Planet Gemini in 1997, which showed a very progressive, experimental side to his playing. In 1999, Batio released his second instructional video, Jam With Angelo, which came with his third studio album as a companion CD: Tradition. This was quickly followed by a fourth full-length album in 2000, Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity, which was credited to \\"Mike Batio and Rob Ross\\", the latter being the drummer. In 2001, Batio released a CD with his band \\"C4,\\" covering songs from his Holland years and including the original \\"Call to Arms.\\" It was his 1st all vocal CD since recording with Nitro. Batio and C4 were featured on \\"Rock My Ass\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXUG-juUGU, a TV show self-described as \\"Chicago's live music venue from your couch\\". This was not Batio's first appearance on the show, having also appeared in 1999 with a band called No Remorse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W3e2Ovkle0&t;=865s. Batio in 2010 In 2003, Batio released his first DVD, the title release in his Speed Kills series, followed by the second, Speed Lives, in 2004. It was also in this year that Batio released a compilation album, Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity Part 2, which featured songs from Tradition and Lucid Intervals. In 2005, Batio released his highly anticipated cover/tribute/studio album, Hands Without Shadows, which featured guest appearances from such musicians as Mark Tremonti (of Alter Bridge fame), Rudy Sarzo (of Ozzy Osbourne, Quiet Riot, Whitesnake and Dio fame) and virtuoso newcomer Bill Peck. In 2006, DVD Speed Kills 2 was released, in addition to the first in the new Hands Without Shadows series, Performance. Batio's latest release came in 2007, when his first two albums - No Boundaries and Planet Gemini - were remixed and remastered with additional drums, for an album entitled 2 X Again; the title of a song from the first album. Angelo also released three DVDs in 2007: Speed Kills 3, 25 Jazz Progressions and MAB Jam Session. In 2011, Batio debuted his multimedia show \\"Hands Without Shadows - A Tribute to Rock Guitar\\" in Las Vegas. In 2012 Batio toured the world with this show. It was a chronological tribute to rock guitar. Batio toured the world with the tribute to rock guitar show in 2013 and 2014. Batio is currently performing concerts featuring his original music mixed with several songs from his tribute to rock guitar show. Batio has been listed as one of the \\"Top 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists of All Time\\" by Guitar World Magazine, for which he wrote the column Time to Burn, and one of the \\"20 Greatest Shredders of All Time\\" by Total Guitar Magazine, both in April 2008. Batio also won the 2009 Guitar World Magazine Readers Choice award in the \\"Best Shredder\\" category. In November 2011, Batio won the Guitar World Magazine Readers Choice Award and was voted the \\"Fastest Guitarist of All Time.\\" Over 440,000 votes were cast. ===Film appearance=== In 1991, Batio's guitar work appeared in the low budget horror film Shock 'Em Dead, recording tracks for the soundtrack as well as playing the guitar parts of the demonically possessed main character Angel Martin in close ups. ==Style== Michael Angelo Batio Batio plays extremely fast and well articulated alternate picking, which he credits to his use of anchoring, or planting the fingers he does not use on the body of the guitar while picking to restrict motion. He is also adept at fluid, sweep-picked arpeggios and tapping. Batio has cited F-sharp minor and F-sharp phrygian dominant as two of his favorite keys. He has described F sharp minor as a \\"demonic\\" key, giving a dark, evil sound. Batio invented and often demonstrates the \\"Over-Under\\" technique, which involves flipping his fretting hand over and under the neck rapidly, playing the guitar both regularly and like a piano. He is ambidextrous, a skill he taught himself. This enables him to play two guitars at the same time either in synchronization or using separate harmonies. This includes playing completely different parts at once, as shown while playing his famous Double- Guitar. Though naturally left-handed, he plays as right-handed when playing one guitar. Batio gave lessons to guitarist Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave fame) while at college. Morello has credited MAB with teaching him in a feature article in Guitar World Magazine in 2005. Batio also gave lessons to guitarist Mark Tremonti after Creed broke up and Tremonti wanted to learn more techniques. Batio has a deep interest in European medieval history, castles and architecture, and is often seen wearing an all- black outfit with chains and other designs related to the medieval period. Many of his guitars have been designed to feature chainmail and flames in the artwork. ==Equipment== ===Guitars=== Two of Batio's signature guitars: The MAB 2 Aviator, and the MAB 1 Armorflame. The guitars sold in stores are no different from the ones he uses in the studio, his instructional DVDs, and in formal concert situations. Batio has an extensive collection of around 170 guitars, which he has accumulated since the 1980s. Among his instruments are a Dave Bunker \\"Touch guitar\\" (double neck with both bass and guitar, similar to the Chapman Stick), a mint-condition 1968 Fender Mustang, a 1986 Fender Stratocaster 1962 re-issue and several other vintage and custom-built guitars. Among his custom-made guitars is a 29-fret guitar made of military-grade aluminum, which makes the guitar very light. For live performances Batio is an exclusive user of Dean Guitars, both electric and acoustic. In 2007 he designed and developed a signature guitar with Dean, known as the MAB1 Armor Flame. Another signature piece of equipment Batio developed is the \\"MAB Hands Without Shadows\\" pickup, which he uses in his Double Guitar when touring. The pickup is specially designed for shred guitar, and provides the clean tone Batio is accustomed to. The Armor Flame, Batio's signature guitar, uses EMG 81, 85 and SA pickups, as his signature DMT pickups were still being developed at that time. Earlier on in his career when he was first endorsed by Dean guitars he also embraced Dean's tradition of popularizing Dimarzio pickups and had used Dimarzios in his guitars. These include the Dimarzio PAF, Super Distortion (sometimes using the Super Distortion both in the neck and bridge position, as he did in his Gibson Charvel Circuit Board double guitar. This was the main setup during the recording of No Boundaries). Batio has also used pickups of other brands including Seymour Duncan, namely the Pearly Gates and JB models and also Bill Lawrence pickups. Currently other than using EMGs in his signature guitar he also has a collection of the other brand pickups in his Dean limited edition collectors' models, such as Dimarzio Custom Super Distortions (based on the Super 2 and Super Distortion) in his USA Dean Time capsule Blue Burst ML and the Seymour Duncan pair he used (refer to above) in his USA Dean Collectors edition Hardtail. ;The Double-Guitar Batio with his double guitar Batio was the inventor of the Double-Guitar, a V-shaped, twin- neck guitar which can be played both right- and left-handed. The first version of this instrument was actually two separate guitars simply played together, as opposed to being one entity. A Flying V was fastened to a snare drum in a left-handed position, while another one was strapped around his shoulder. The next version of the guitar, as designed by Batio and guitar technician Kenny Breit, featured a flight case latch attached to the back of each guitar, which could reportedly be assembled in five seconds. By far his most famous and definitely his most photographed double guitar is his USA Dean Mach 7 Jet Double-Guitar along with its custom Anvil flight case. One of his inspirations for the radical design was jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, who was known for playing two or three instruments simultaneously. Batio saw Kirk in concert during his teens, and said the jazz musician \\"blew his mind.\\"\\"Michael Angelo Batio: I always wanted my guitars to be different and unique\\", Joe Matera interview, 2008, Ultimate Guitar Archive. When the Double Guitar was first used in concert, Batio noticed that the guitars created a lot of feedback when played together. He decided that he needed to invent a way to 'dampen' the strings when both guitars were played at the same time, hence the invention of the \\"MAB String Dampener\\", which is now available to buy from M.A.C.E. Music. The Double Guitar was recently named as the 8th \\"coolest guitar in rock\\" by online music magazine Gigwise. His iconic Dean 'Jet' Double-Guitar has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum and was put on permanent display in February 2012. This guitar was built by Mike Lipe for Dean Guitars. ;The Quad Guitar As well as the Double Guitar, Michael Angelo also invented and designed the Quad Guitar. The guitar was originally built in conjunction with Gibson, and built by Wayne Charvel in California. The top two guitars have seven strings, while the bottom two have the regular six. The first Quad, as used in the video for Nitro's \\"Freight Train\\", was stolen in El Paso, Texas after the second show of Nitro's O.F.R. tour. When Batio was performing in November 2004, a young fan named Simon Jones and his father turned up with a guitar case which held inside the two top guitars of the Quad, as found by Mick Seymour. Dean designed and had Mike Lipe build a new Quad Guitar in 2008. The Quad Guitar was recently named as the 2nd \\"coolest guitar in rock\\" by online music magazine Gigwise. ===Effects=== In his years with Nitro, Batio used Boss overdrive (DS-1, SD-1) pedals. In his later years, beginning with his first solo album \\"No Boundaries,\\" Batio used and still uses the original TS-9 Tube Screamer. He has vintage TS-9 pedals in his studio, that are only for recording and newer ones that he uses on tour. In the studio, Batio also uses the following effects pedals: *Vintage Digitech Whammy *Dunlop Cry Baby *Vintage Digitech 256 multifx *Eventide Eclipse *Rocktron Chameleon Pre amp *Rocktron Voodoo Valve Pre amp *Rocktron Intellifex *Rocktron Replifex ===Amplification=== During his years with Nitro, Batio used Randall amplifiers. However, he used a Marshall amp early in his career, a JCM 800 (which was modified, mainly by Jose Arrendondo). In later years he made particular use of the JCM 900, when recording No Boundaries, and has primarily used this and other Marshall amps since. Currently, Batio typically uses Marshall JCM 2000 amps on tour, which also appear on his more recent studio records. In the studio, he also uses the Marshall JMP-1 preamp and Rocktron Chameleon and Voodoo Valve preamps. Batio's cabinet setup consists of 4x12 Marshall cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30s and Greenbacks, in mono and stereo. ===Other equipment=== ;Strings Batio uses Ernie Ball guitar strings, favoring the .009 to .042 models for soloing and most rhythm guitar parts while thicker gauge strings are used for detuned guitars. The acoustic gauge is normally .010 to .047 or .011 to .052. ;Picks For most of his career, Batio used Dunlop Jazz III picks as his guitar pick of choice, and has used the 'teardrop' shape of pick since he first started playing. However, in 2016, Batio released the \\"Michael Angelo Batio Signature 1.3mm Dura Picks, Premium Shredder Jazz Shaped Pick\\" from ChromaCast. These picks are a slightly larger version of his former favorite Dunlop Jazz III picks, made with a different material. For his acoustic work, Batio will sometimes use different picks. ==Discography== *No Boundaries (1995) *Holiday Strings (1996) *Planet Gemini (1997) *Tradition (1999) *Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity (2000) *Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity Part 2 (2004) *Hands Without Shadows (2005) *2 X Again (2007) *Hands Without Shadows 2 ‚Äì Voices (2009) *Backing Tracks (2010) *Intermezzo (2013) *Shred Force 1: The Essential MAB (2015) *Soul in Sight (2016) *More Machine Than Man (2020) ==References== ==External links== *2015 Michael Angelo Batio Interview on Guitar.com *Michael Angelo Batio at Reidmoto Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:Living people Category:Nitro (band) members Category:Northeastern Illinois University alumni Category:1956 births Category:Lead guitarists Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American people of German descent Category:American music educators Category:Guitarists from Chicago Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Shout (band) members Category:Educators from Illinois Category:21st-century American guitarists ","title":"Michael Angelo Batio"},{"id":"1296557","text":"Johann Nikolaus G√∂tz.

(), p. 11. was a throne claimant and titular queen regnant of Aragon, titular queen consort of Naples, Duchess of Anjou, Countess of Provence, and regent of Provence during the minority of her son. She was a daughter of John I of Aragon and his wife Yolande of Bar (daughter of Robert I, Duke of Bar, and Marie of Valois). Yolande played a crucial role in the struggles between France and England, influencing events such as the financing of Joan of Arc's army in 1429 that helped tip the balance in favour of the French. She was also known as Yolanda de Arag√≥n and Violant d'Arag√≥. Tradition holds that she commissioned the famous Rohan Hours. ==Family and marriage== Yolande was born in Zaragoza, Aragon, on 11 August 1384, the eldest daughter of King John I of Aragon by his second wife, Yolande of Bar, the granddaughter of King John II of France. She had three brothers and two sisters, as well as five older half-siblings from her father's first marriage to Martha of Armagnac. Yolande later played an important role in the politics of England, France, and Aragon during the first half of the 15th century. In 1389, Louis II was crowned King of Naples. His mother Marie of Blois opened negotiations for a marriage between her son and Yolande to prevent Aragon from obstructing his rule there. When Yolande was eleven, she signed a document to disavow any promises made by ambassadors about her marrying Louis II. In 1395, Richard II of England also opened negotiations for Yolande's hand. To prevent this marriage, Charles VI of France offered his own daughter Isabella to King Richard. After the death of Yolande's father, Marie of Blois convinced Yolande's uncle Martin I of Aragon to have Yolande wed Louis II. Yolande signed a protest, but was forced to retract it later. The couple married in Arles on December 2, 1400. Despite Yolande's earlier objections and the later illnesses of her husband, the marriage was a success. ==Claim to the Aragonese throne== As the surviving daughter of King John I of Aragon, she claimed the throne of Aragon after the deaths of her elder sister Joanna, Countess of Foix, and her uncle, King Martin I. However, unclear though they were, the laws of succession for Aragon and Barcelona at that time were understood to favour all male relatives over the females (which is how Yolande's uncle Martin of Aragon came to inherit the throne of Aragon). Martin died without surviving issue in 1410, and after two years without a king, the Estates of Aragon elected Ferdinand, the second son of Eleanor of Aragon and John I of Castile, as the next King of Aragon. The Anjou candidate for the throne of Aragon was Yolande's eldest son Louis III of Anjou, Duke of Calabria, whose claim was forfeited in the Pact of Caspe. Yolande and her sons regarded themselves as the heirs with the stronger claim, and began to use the title of Kings of Aragon. As a result of this additional inheritance, Yolande was called the \\"Queen of Four Kingdoms\\" - the four apparently Sicily, Jerusalem, Cyprus and Aragon. Another interpretation specifies Naples separate from Sicily, plus Jerusalem and Aragon. The number could be raised to seven if the two component kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon (Majorca and Valencia) and Sardinia were included. However, the reality was that Yolande and her family controlled territories in the said kingdoms only at short intervals, if ever. Their true realm was the Anjou fiefdoms across France: they held uncontestably the provinces of Provence and Anjou, and also at times Bar, Maine, Touraine and Valois. Yolande's son Ren√© I of Anjou became ruler of Lorraine through his marriage to Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. ==France and the House of Anjou== In the emerging second phase of the Hundred Years' War, Yolande chose to support the French (in particular the Armagnac party) against the English and the Burgundians. After John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, instigated a mob attack on the Dauphin of France in 1413, she and her husband repudiated the engagement of their son Louis to John's daughter Catherine of Burgundy, which placed them decisively in the Armagnac camp. In the same year, Yolande met with Queen Isabeau of France to finalize a marriage contract between her daughter Marie and Isabeau's third surviving son Charles. After his two older brothers died, she supported the claim of the Dauphin Charles who, relying upon Yolande's resources and help, succeeded in becoming crowned Charles VII of France. As Charles' own mother, Queen Isabeau, worked against his claims, it has been said that Yolande was the person who protected the adolescent Charles against all sorts of plots on his life and acted as a substitute mother. She removed Charles from his parents' court and kept him in her own castles, usually those in the Loire Valley, where Charles received Joan of Arc. Yolande arranged the marriage of Charles to her daughter Mary of Anjou, thus becoming Charles' mother-in-law. This led to Yolande's personal, and crucial, involvement in the struggle for the survival of the House of Valois in France. Yolande's marriage to Louis II of Anjou, at Arles in December 1400, was arranged as a part of long-standing efforts to resolve contested claims upon the kingdom of Sicily and Naples between the houses of Anjou and Aragon. Louis spent much of his life fighting in Italy for his claim to the Kingdom of Naples. In France, Yolande was the Duchess of Anjou and the Countess of Provence. She preferred to hold court in Angers and Saumur. She had six children, and through her second son Ren√© was the grandmother of Margaret of Anjou, the wife of King Henry VI of England. With the victory of the English over the French at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the Duchy of Anjou was threatened. The French king, Charles VI, was mentally ill and his realm was in a state of civil war between the Burgundians and the Orleanists (Armagnacs). The situation was made worse by an alliance among the Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, the English, and the French queen, Isabeau of Bavaria, who submitted to the Duke of Burgundy's scheme to deny the crown of France to the children of Charles VI. Fearing the abusive power building behind the Duke of Burgundy, Louis II had Yolande move with her children and future son-in-law, Charles, to Provence in southern France. ==The Dauphin== In the years 1415 and 1417, the two oldest surviving sons of Charles VI of France died in quick succession: first Louis, then Jean. Both brothers had been in the care of the Duke of Burgundy. Yolande was the protectress of her son-in- law, Charles, who became the new Dauphin. She refused Queen Isabeau's orders to return Charles to the French Court, reportedly replying, \\"We have not nurtured and cherished this one for you to make him die like his brothers or to go mad like his father, or to become English like you. I keep him for my own. Come and take him away, if you dare.\\" (according to Jehan de Bourdign√©) On 29 April 1417, Louis II of Anjou died of illness, leaving Yolande, at age 33, in control of the House of Anjou. She acted as regent for her son because of his youth. She also had the fate of the French royal house of Valois in her hands. Her young son-in-law, the Dauphin Charles, was exceptionally vulnerable to the designs of the English King, Henry V, and to his older cousin, John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy. Charles' nearest older relatives, the Dukes of Orl√©ans and of Bourbon, had been made prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt and were held captive by the English. With his mother, Queen Isabeau, and the Duke of Burgundy allied with the English, Charles had no resources to support him other than those of the House of Anjou and the smaller House of Armagnac. Following the assassination of John the Fearless at Montereau in 1419, his son Philip the Good succeeded him as Duke of Burgundy. With Henry V of England, he forced the Treaty of Troyes (21 May 1420) on the mentally-ill King Charles VI. The treaty designated Henry as \\"Regent of France\\" and heir to the French throne. Following this, the Dauphin Charles was declared disinherited in 1421. When both Henry V of England and Charles VI of France died in 1422 (on 31 August and 21 October, respectively), the Dauphin Charles, at age 19, legitimately became Charles VII of France. Charles' title was challenged by the English and their Burgundian allies, who supported the candidacy of Henry VI of England, the infant son of Henry V and Catherine of Valois, Charles' own sister, as king of France. This set the stage for the last phase of the Hundred Years' War: the \\"War of Charles VII\\". In this struggle, Yolande played a prominent role in surrounding the young Valois king with advisers and servants associated with the House of Anjou. She manoeuvred John VI, Duke of Brittany, into breaking an alliance with the English, and was responsible for a soldier from the Breton ducal family, Arthur de Richemont, becoming Constable of France in 1425. Yolande's early and strong support of Joan of Arc, when others had doubts, suggests her possible larger role in orchestrating Joan's appearance on the scene. Yolande unquestionably practised realistic politics. Using the Constable de Richemont, Yolande was behind the forceful removal of several of Charles VII's advisers. Thus, La Tr√©moille was attacked and forced from the court in 1433. Yolande was not averse to recruiting beautiful women and coaching them to become the mistresses of influential men who would spy on them on her behalf. She had a network of such women in the courts of Lorraine, Burgundy, Brittany, and her son-in-law. The contemporary chronicler Jean Juvenal des Ursins (1433‚Äì44), Bishop of Beauvais, described Yolande as \\"the prettiest woman in the kingdom.\\" Bourdign√©, chronicler of the house of Anjou, says of her: \\"She who was said to be the wisest and most beautiful princess in Christendom.\\" Later, King Louis XI of France recalled that his grandmother had \\"a man's heart in a woman's body.\\" A twentieth-century French author, Jehanne d'Orliac, wrote one of the few works specifically on Yolande, and noted that the duchess remains unappreciated for her genius and influence in the reign of Charles VII. \\"She is mentioned in passing because she is the pivot of all important events for forty-two years in France\\", while \\"Joan [of Arc] was in the public eye only eleven months.\\" Yolande retired to Angers and then to Saumur. She continued to play a role in politics. When the bishopric in Angers fell vacant, she threatened Charles VII's candidate with beheading if he showed up in the city. The king backed down and the post went to her secretary. At least from 1439 onwards, her granddaughter Margaret of Anjou came to live with her. Yolande taught her not only etiquette and literature, but also how to check account books. Her last act before her death was to prepare Margaret for a possible marriage with Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. She received his ambassadors in Samur and presented her granddaughter to them. She died at the town house of the Seigneur de Tuc√© in Saumur on 14 November 1442.\\"Yolande ... mourut √† Saumur, en l'h√¥tel du seigneur de Tuc√©, le 14 novembre 1442\\": Albert Lecoy de La Marche, Le roi Ren√©, sa vie, son administration, ses travaux artistiques et litt√©raires, d'apr√®s les documents in√©dits des archives de France et d'Italie (Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1875) vol. 1 p. 226 ==Marriage and issue== She was betrothed in 1390 to Louis, the heir of Anjou (who had one year earlier succeeded in conquering Naples and become King Ludovico II of Naples), and married him on 2 December 1400 at Montpellier. Their children were: # Louis III of Anjou (25 September 1403 ‚Äì 12 November 1434), Duke of Anjou, Titular King of Naples. He was adopted by Queen Joanna II of Naples. Married Margaret of Savoy.

Had issue by both marriages. ==Fictional portrayals== Queen Yolande appears as a character in Jean Anouilh's acclaimed play about Joan of Arc The Lark, the role being created by Denise Perret; and in the TV series Catherine, in which she was played by Genevi√®ve Casile, the grand dame of the French theatre. Yolande also appears as a character in the 1999 film The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, in which she is played by actress Faye Dunaway. She is also the subject of a historical novel The Queen of Four Kingdoms, by Princess Michael of Kent (Beaufort Books, 2014). ==Sources== * Zita Rohr, \\"Lifting the Tapestry: The Designs of Yolande of Aragon (1381-1442)\\", in Anthony McElligott, Liam Chambers, Ciara Breathnach, Catherine Lawless (dir.), Power in History : From Medieval Ireland to the Post-Modern World, Dublin / Portland, Oregon, Irish Academic Press, coll. \\"Historical studies\\" (n¬∞ 27), 2011, XVI-314 p.

Along with Meshuggah's rhythm guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m, Thordendal was rated No. 35 by Guitar World in the top 100 greatest heavy metal guitarists of all-time. ==Musical career== Thordendal began his career when he formed \\"Metallien\\", a heavily Metallica- influenced band, in his hometown Ume√• in 1985. The band later changed their name to Meshuggah and released their first LP Psykisk Testbild in 1989.Ekeroth, Daniel (2006). Swedish deathmetal. sid. 390. Beginning as a thrash metal band, Meshuggah's music gradually evolved into a more progressive sound. This sound has become influential on other bands, such as Periphery, whose core member Misha Mansoor was instrumental in coining the term \\"Djent\\" in reference to the commonly-utilised technique of playing heavily muted, extended powerchords found within Meshuggah's music.https://www.houstonpress.com/music/what-the-hell-is-djent-metal- anyway-6777469 Thordendal has been widely recognizedhttp://www.metalsucks.net/2011/06/01/4-fredrik-thordendal-meshuggah/ in the metal community for his work with Meshuggah. Under the name Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects, Thordendal released a solo album in 1997 titled Sol Niger Within with Ultimate Audio Entertainment. The album was remixed and re-released by Ultimate Audio Entertainment and Relapse Records in 1999 under the title Sol Niger Within version 3.33. The re-release contains two bonus tracks but omits several parts of the original version. SNW's newly mastered version was also released for the first time on vinyl in 2016 by Husaria Records, an American label specializing in audiophile releases; the album's original material was pressed as both lacquer cut variant (500 units) and Direct Metal Mastering variant (500 units). Thordendal also featured on several tracks for drummer Morgan √Ögren's Mats/Morgan Band. As a guitarist, Thordendal draws attention with his clean, complex lead-playing, inspired by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth, and complex rhythm-playing featuring prominent polymetric passages. These characteristics are augmented by his use of seven and eight-string guitars. He has a large contribution to songwriting, as well as providing backing vocals for some songs during live performances. Fredrik has been quoted as stating that Metallica and Tool as influences on Meshuggah. Meshuggah supported Tool during their U.S. tour in the fall of 2002, where drummer Tomas Haake even guest appearing, playing \\"Triad\\" with the band. Fredrik praises jazz fusion guitarist Wayne Krantz's work with Keith Carlock and Tim Lefebvre, stating that \\"these guys are the most inspiring band I've heard in a very long time\\". He has also stated that he listens to Massive Attack and Cult of Luna. In an interview with Guitar World in 2011 Fredrik states \\"My dad always listened to jazz, and I guess that influenced me to learn about improvisation. An improvised solo sounds so much better than a written one. For me, there's not much thinking going on at all, only a reaction to what I'm being told from the inside. And no, I have not had any formal training. When I record my leads, they are usually based on feel and totally ignorant to all laws of music theory. This, of course, is because I just play whatever comes out. There are no rules. But on certain songs, I do have to figure out what scales I need to use to follow chord changes. Since I'm not very good with all the scales, I sometimes have to write parts down and plan things ahead. I usually improvise the first part, then insert the written part and continue to improvise until the end of the solo. It's a very confusing way to do it, but I do whatever it takes to make it sound like I know what I'm doing\\". Fredrik utilizes a unique device for his leads, referred to as the MIDI breath controller. He states \\"I was mainly interested in using it as a dynamics controller. I wanted to start a note at a lower volume and then bring it up, like a saxophonist does. But I've since found that is more or less impossible with a guitar. Since the controller didn't produce the sound I was after, I had to find other ways of using it. It turned out that the only thing that sounded cool was when I blew every single note with it, which generated this weird staccato sound. The first breath controller we made‚Äîthe one I used on \\"Future Breed Machine\\" and \\"Sublevels\\" from Destroy Erase Improve‚Äîcould only control the volume. So Johan Haake and I tried all kinds of things to get closer to what I originally wanted, like adding control over frequencies and distortion. I am really pleased with how the \\"Missing Time\\" solo turned out from Sol Niger Within Version 3.33 [the remix CD of the debut album from his side project Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects]. But I never thought we got close enough, so I sort of gave up on it. A couple of years ago it was for sale to the public, but not any more\\". In 2010, Fredrik recorded some drum tracks with Morgan √Ögren [of Swedish prog-rock band Kaipa] and [Soilwork's] Dirk Verbeuren. Fredrik Thordendal live 2016 Several of Fredrik's demos have been released on the internet as MP3s or as videos on YouTube. One composition entitled \\"Demo 33\\" can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkSb7wtj0E. \\"Demo 33\\" was used to demonstrate Fredrik's MIDI breath controller, which is used on several Meshuggah songs, one being Future Breed Machine. More information regarding the controller can be found at http://www8.tfe.umu.se/personliga/jh/index.html (along with the original \\"Demo 33\\" MP3 and other demos of the device). The site was created by Johan Haake, brother of Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake, and the creator of the original MIDI breath controller for Fredrik. Another demo idea, called \\"Secrets of the Unknown\\" can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMUXa6Q7B6I. With regards to a second Special Defects album Fredrik states \\"It‚Äôs actually been messing with my head for years now. I haven‚Äôt really found the time to get the project going. This is a project that I will work on for a longer time, with no rush whatsoever, to make it the best I possibly can. I‚Äôm looking forward to making it because I think it will sound so different from anything I‚Äôve ever heard before\\". Thordendal is also a producer of some note, having produced all of Meshuggah's recent material and also releases for various other bands, Switzerland's Fragment among them. Thordendal has featured in numerous side-projects, such as XXX Atomic Toejam with Petter Marklund. The project had released a 7\\" two- track single \\"Celebration\\" under the name Sep√ºlchre Inc., then took the moniker XXX Atomic Toejam and issued an MCD entitled \\"A Gathering of the Tribes for the First / Last Human Be-In\\" on Cold Meat Industry and also featured a track on the \\"Karmanik Collection\\" compilation. A full-length album was long announced, but never surfaced. Thordendal also played bass for Petter Marklund's solo project Memorandum and together with Marklund remixed tracks on the 1995 compilation album \\"Ars Moriendi\\". Thordendal features in the Darkane track \\"Psychic Pain\\" from the album Insanity, performing lead guitar. Thordendal also contributed to the song \\"Asphyxiate\\" which can be found on Scarve's album Irradiant. He played a guitar solo on the title track of the Devin Townsend Project album Deconstruction. Fredrik Thordendal cut off the tip of his left middle finger at work. The fingertip was sewn back on, and after a fair degree of re-learning and practicing, he regained full proficiency on guitar within a year or so. He also made a contribution towards the soundtrack to the video games Wolfenstein: The New Order, released 2014Ekeroth, Daniel (2006). Swedish deathmetal. sid. 390. and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, released 2017. ==Equipment== ===Guitars=== Meshuggahs guitars used live 2016 Thordendal's current main guitars are Ibanez Custom 8-String M8M which feature RG-shaped or Iceman-shaped alder bodies with 5-piece maple/Bubinga neck-thru necks (29.4\\" {746.76 mm}), rosewood fingerboards (no inlays), fixed bridge (actually an Ibanez FX-Edge fixed tremolo), one volume, one tone, and one Lundgren Model 8 pickup. The fixed bridge on one of his 8 strings has since been replaced with a Kahler tremolo system. Thordendal also owns a 7-string acoustic guitar, also made by Ibanez. For some time he also used Nevborn guitars. This company made Meshuggah their first 8 string guitars: however these guitars suffered from intonation problems, causing Thordendal to abandon the company and switch to exclusively using Ibanez guitars. On the current North American tour promoting Koloss, he has been using a custom Firebird, Iceman and Explorer type body 8 string, the Stoneman. The Stoneman features a 27\\" scale length, which Thordendal prefers, as mentioned by his tech in an interview with Premier Guitar. This guitar is in production by the name Ibanez FTM33. Tuning: For early Meshuggah releases, Fredrik tuned his 7 strings in B‚ô≠ tuning (a half step below standard tuning on a 7-string guitar). He followed suit when he started using 8 string guitars, tuning them down to F tuning (F, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, A‚ô≠, D‚ô≠,G‚ô≠, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠). It was explained in an interview that they tuned their guitars this way because in the early days of Meshuggah, before Jens Kidman adopted his signature vocal style, it was easier for him to sing in the key of E‚ô≠ or B‚ô≠. Occasionally Thordendal deviates from his \\"standard\\" tuning: on the songs \\"Glints Collide\\", \\"Organic Shadows\\", \\"Perpetual Black Second\\", \\"The Hurt That Finds You First\\" and \\"Stengah\\" he tunes the low F string of his 8 string guitar a half step lower to E, he also tunes it to E‚ô≠ on \\"Nebulous\\" and \\"Shed\\" and even to D on \\"Obsidian\\". On \\"Spasm\\" he tunes it even lower from that, down to B‚ô≠ (B‚ô≠, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, A‚ô≠, D‚ô≠, G‚ô≠, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠), making the 8th string an octave below the 7th, while \\"Mind's Mirrors\\" utilizes the 8th string tuned down to E0.

The lyceum's library eventually split into a separate institution at the end of the 19th century. In 1892, William Marsh Rice, a Houston businessman and philanthropist who later chartered Rice University, donated $200,000 for the construction of a free public library.

By this time, they had outgrown their space and relocated several staff members to the Harris County Courthouse. A few years later, the library sold its property to raise money for a larger facility.Chapman (2004), pp. 1415. ===Julia Ideson Library=== The library board selected a lot once occupied by Thomas M. Bagby, a co-founder of the 1848 Houston Lyceum. They commissioned Cram and Ferguson as design architects, in consultation with William Ward Watkin and Louis A. Glover. The building was completed in two years and at a cost of $500,000. The Spanish Renaissance design draws from regional history, and includes carvings of explorers and missionaries of Texas. The second floor hall lay under a rotunda, fronted by an interior oaken gate with carved columns and entablatures. The new building opened with a collection of more than thirty thousand volumes.Chapman (2004), pp. 2125. The building constructed as Houston's Central Library in 1926 was later named the Julia Ideson Building in her honor. ===Carnegie Colored Library=== The board for the Houston Carnegie Library had planned for universal access to the facilities. However, those working at the library turned away African-Americans educators who visited in 1907, while ostensibly referring the matter to the trustees. A group of African-American educators led by Ernest O. Smith lobbied local white leaders and the Carnegie Foundation for a library to serve the black community. The Colored Carnegie Library of Houston opened in 1913 with an African American board of trustees and management. It was transferred to the management as a branch library of Houston Public Library in 1921. On July 31, 1961, the Carnegie Colored Library closed. The library facility required extensive repairs and it was in the path of the Clay Avenue extension project. The branch, auctioned in February 1962 and shortly afterward demolished except for the cornerstone, was replaced by the W. L. D. Johnson Library in Sunnyside, dedicated on June 16, 1964. ===Expansion and branch libraries=== The library system racially desegregated in 1953. Alternative method: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254956573_Cheryl_Knott_Malone_- _Unannounced_and_Unexpected_The_Desegregation_of_Houston_Public_Library_in_the_Early_1950s_- _Library_Trends_553, registration required. Beforehand, blacks were permitted use of the Colored Carnegie Branch and deposit stations located at a park, a high school, and an elementary school; whites were permitted use of the main library, six branches, two bookmobiles, and several deposit stations. Desegregation occurred after a letter printed in the Houston Informer from several prominent black Houstonians, including Smith v. Allwright plaintiff Lonnie E. Smith, stated they would prefer a voluntary desegregation program despite their likelihood of winning a lawsuit; shortly before the letter was printed, Sweatt v. Painter was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which challenged the \\"separate but equal\\" legal doctrine. In June 1953, Mayor of Houston Roy Hofheinz told the HPL board that library facilities should no longer be segregated. On August 21, 1953, library facilities for high school students and adults were desegregated ‚Äì without public announcement to the black community. The library system now consists of 35 neighborhood libraries, including four regional libraries, the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in the Museum District, and the Central Library in Downtown. Central Library consists of the Julia Ideson Building and the Jesse H. Jones Building, constructed in 1976.\\"In Memory of Mr. Seth Irvin Morris\\" (). Houston Public Library. August 2, 2006.

Rhodes' illustrative diary of his war service was quoted prominently in Ken Burns' PBS documentary The Civil War. ==Early life== Rhodes was born in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island, to Elisha H. Rhodes and Eliza A. Chase. He had several sisters and two brothers. At age 14, Rhodes attended Potter and Hammond's Business Academy in Providence. His father drowned when his schooner, the merchant ship Worcester, was sunk by a hurricane on December 10, 1858. He was buried on Linyards Cay, Abaco in the Bahamas. ==Civil War== Rhodes served with the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry throughout its service during the American Civil War. Rhodes enlisted in the war with his mother's permission. At first he believed war to be an adventure. During the war, he advanced from corporal to lieutenant colonel in command of the regiment. He enlisted on June 5, 1861 and was appointed to the rank of corporal. He was promoted to sergeant major on March 1, 1862 and to 2nd lieutenant on July 24 of the same year. On April 15, 1863 he was promoted to 1st lieutenant and placed in command of Company B. He became the regiment's adjutant, with the rank of 1st lieutenant, on November 6, 1863. He served in this capacity until the regiment was reorganized on June 17, 1864. On June 21, 1864 he was promoted to captain and assigned to Company B but was also ordered to command the regiment, which he did for the remainder of the war. He received a brevet (honorary promotion) to the rank of major on December 5, 1864. On February 6, 1865 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the regiment. On April 2 he received a brevet to the rank of colonel in recognition of his service in the Petersburg campaign. He was mustered out of service, along with his regiment, on July 13, 1865. Report of the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, 1892. p.p. 81-82. ==Postbellum career== After the war, he became a successful businessman and became active in veterans' affairs. He never missed a regimental reunion of the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry. He married Caroline Pearce Hunt (1841‚Äì1930) on June 12, 1866 and had a son, Frederick Miller Rhodes and a daughter Alice Caroline Rhodes Chace. He was appointed as collector of U. S. Internal Revenue in Rhode Island in 1875. From June 25, 1879 until March 21, 1892 he served as the commander of the Brigade of Rhode Island Militia with the rank of brigadier general. Report of the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, 1892. p.p. 81-82. During his time in office General Rhodes helped transform the militia into a more professional organization and established the state training ground at Quonset Point in North Kingstown. ==Memberships== Rhodes was very active in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), the largest of several organizations for Union veterans. He was Adjutant of Prescott Post, No. 1, in 1867, Commander of the post the next year, Assistant Adjutant General of the Department of Rhode Island in 1871, Commander of the department in 1872‚Äì73, member of the National Encampment in 1874‚Äì75. He served for one year (1877‚Äì78) as the GAR's national senior vice commander. He was also Vice President of the Society of the Army of the Potomac in 1877, and president of the Second Rhode Island Volunteer Association. He was also president of the Rhode Island Soldiers' and Sailors' Historical Society since its formation in 1873, and in 1879 was Vice President of the 6th Army Corps Association. In 1892 he was elected as a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) ‚Äî a military society composed of officers who had served in the Union armed forces during the Civil War. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 9476. An active Freemason, having joined the fraternity while home on leave in 1864, he served as Worshipful Master of Harmony Lodge, No. 9, in Cranston, Rhode Island. He was later elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island for 1892-1893. ==Death and burial== Grave of Elisha Hunt Rhodes in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, RI. Rhodes died in Providence on January 14, 1917. He and his wife are buried at the Rhodes family plot in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.Long Time Gone ==Legacy== Elisha Hunt Rhodes is most remembered for his wartime journal and letters published as All For the Union by a great- grandson, Robert H. Rhodes. This diary reflects Rhodes' ideas about the Civil War, including his unwavering belief that the Union must be preserved, as well as his Christian faith and belief in God. At the end it shows a somewhat conflicted young man who wanted to be home with his family after trials of war but who also found life in the Army very agreeable to him. His writings were made famous by their incorporation into filmmaker Ken Burns' PBS-TV documentary series The Civil War. His large collection of personal relics and mementos is now owned by the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence. ==References== * The Union Army; A History of Military Affairs in the Loyal States, 1861-65 -- Records of the Regiments in the Union Army -- Cyclopedia of Battles -- Memoirs of Commanders and Soldiers, Federal Publishing Company (Madison, Wisconsin), 1908 (reprinted by Broadfoot Publishing, 1997), Volume 1, pp. 228‚Äì30. ==External links== *GAR veterans bio of Rhodes Category:1842 births Category:1917 deaths Category:American diarists Category:People of Rhode Island in the American Civil War Category:Union Army generals Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery ","title":"Elisha Hunt Rhodes"},{"id":"1296609","text":"Pinehurst may refer to: ==Place names== ===Canada=== * Pinehurst, Nova Scotia, village located outside New Germany * Pinehurst Lake, lake in northeastern Alberta ===South Africa=== * Pinehurst, Western Cape, home belonging to a 'Ostrich Baron' * Pinehurst, Durbanville, a residential estate in Durbanville, Western Cape. ===United States=== * Pinehurst, California * Pinehurst, Georgia * Pinehurst, Idaho * Pinehurst, Massachusetts * Pinehurst, North Carolina, a village in Moore County ** Pinehurst Resort, golf resort ** Pinehurst Race Track, race track complex * Pinehurst, Ohio * Pinehurst, Oregon **Pinehurst State Airport * Pinehurst, Montgomery County, Texas * Pinehurst, Orange County, Texas * Pinehurst, Seattle, Washington * Pinehurst Circle, in Washington, D.C. ==Other== * Pinehurst School, school in Auckland, New Zealand * Pinehurst F.C., a former association football team from England * Pinehurst System, a pairs playing format in golf ","title":"Pinehurst"},{"id":"1296630","text":"Tulare may refer to: ;Places * Tulare Lake, California * Tulare County, California * Tulare, California * Tulare, South Dakota * Tulare (Medveƒëa), a village in Serbia * Tulare (Prokuplje), a village in Serbia ;Ships * , a United States Navy attack cargo ship in commission from 1956 to 1986 ","title":"Tulare"},{"id":"1296631","text":"Perry Park was the home field for the Keokuk Westerns of the National Association during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league.

In the United States, the most prominent Reporter of Decisions is the Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, an officer of the Supreme Court of the United States, responsible for reporting the decisions of that court in the official report volumes, known as the United States Reports. In contrast, the United States courts of appeals have not historically appointed official reporters of decisions, relying instead on the private company West Publishing to report appellate decisions in its Federal Reporter series.

He was born at Bar- sur-Aube and went to Paris at an early age as the pupil of Martin Cour. Perfume burner by Gouthiere, circa 1774-1775. Red jasper and gilded bronze. During his brilliant career he executed a vast quantity of metal work of the utmost variety, the best of which was unsurpassed by any of his rivals in that great art period. It was long believed that he received many commissions for furniture from the court of Louis XVI, and especially from Marie Antoinette, but recent searches suggest that his work for the queen was confined to bronzes. Gouthi√®re can, however, well bear this loss, nor will his reputation suffer should those critics ultimately be justified who believe that many of the furniture mounts attributed to him were from the hand of Thomire. But if he did not work for the court he unquestionably produced many of the most splendid belongings of the duc d'Aumont, the duchesse de Mazarin and Madame du Barry. Indeed the custom of the beautiful mistress of Louis XV brought about the financial ruin of the great artist, who accomplished more than any other man for the fame of her ch√¢teau of Louveciennes. When the collection of the duc d'Aumont was sold by auction in Paris in 1782 so many objects niounted by Gouthi√®re were bought for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette that it is not difficult to perceive the basis of the belief that they were actually made for the court. The duc's sale catalogue is, however, in existence, with the names of the purchasers and the prices realized. The auction was almost an apotheosis of Gouthi√®re. The precious lacquer cabinets, the chandeliers and candelabra, the tables and cabinets in marquetry, the columns and vases in porphyry, jasper and choice marbles, the porcelains of China and Japan were nearly all mounted in bronze by him. More than fifty of these pieces bore Gouthi√®re's signature. The duc d'Aumont's cabinet represented the high-water mark of the chasers art, and the great prices which were paid for Gouthi√®re's work at this sale are the most conclusive criterion of the value set upon his achievement in his own day. Thus Marie Antoinette paid 12,000 livres for a red jasper bowl or br~~le-parfums mounted by him, which was then already famous. Curiously enough it commanded only one-tenth of that price at the Fournier sale in 1831; but in 1865, when the marquis of Hertford bought it at the prince de Beauvais's sale, it fetched 31,900 francs. It is now in the Wallace Collection, which contains the finest and most representative gathering of Gouthi√®re's undoubted work. The mounts of gilt bronze, cast and elaborately chased, show satyr's heads, from which hang festoons of vine leaves, while within the feet a serpent is coiled to spring. A smaller cup is one of the treasures of the Louvre. There too is a bronze clock, signed by Gouthi√®re, cizileur et doreur du Roy a Paris, dated 1771, with a river god, a water nymph symbolizing the Rhne and its tributary the Durance, and a female figure typifying the city of Avignon. Not all of Gouthi√®re's work is of the highest quality, and much of what he executed was from the designs of others. At his best his delicacy, refinement and finish are exceedingly delightfulin his great moments he ranks with the highest alike as artist and as craftsman. The tone of soft dead gold which is found on some of his mounts he is believed to have invented, but indeed the gilding of all his superlative work possesses a remarkable quality. This charm of tone is admirably seen in the bronzes and candelabra which he executed for the chimney-piece of Marie Antoinette's boudoir at Fontainebleau. He continued to embellish Louveciennes for Madame du Barry until the Revolution, and then the guillotine came for her and absolute ruin for him. When her property was seized she owed him 756,000 livres, of which he never received a sol, despite repeated applications to the administrators. \\"R√©duit a solliciter une place √† l'hospice, il mourut dans la mis√©re.\\" So it was stated in a lawsuit brought by his sons against du Barry's heirs. ==External links== * Category:1732 births Category:1813 deaths Category:People from Bar-sur-Aube ","title":"Pierre Gouthi√®re"},{"id":"1296748","text":"Phang Nga (, , ) is a town (thesaban mueang) in southern Thailand, capital of Phang Nga Province.

It is best known as the home of the Detroit Wolverines of the National League from 1881 to 1888. Recreation Park was built in 1879. Its developers intended it to be a multi-use facility. There was a half-mile dirt track running along the outside of the property to be used for horse racing, bicycling and foot races. The owners also envisioned use for baseball, cricket, archery, croquet, as well as ice skating in the winter. Detroit fielded a minor league team that summer. Two years later the Wolverines major league team made its debut. The first major league baseball game in Detroit was played here on May 2nd, 1881. As the 1880s progressed, the team improved and won the National League pennant in 1887, as well as the World Series, defeating the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. By the end of the next season, the club was losing money in spite of its successes, and dropped out of the league. Minor league ball resumed in 1889 and was played for two seasons (plus one game in 1891) before the club folded altogether. Recreation Park continued to be used for various other activities, but by 1894 it was pretty much abandoned, and the structures were demolished. The Park was on a rectangular site north of the downtown area, less than a mile from the location of the future Comerica Park. The field was laid out so that the foul lines hit the fences at a 135¬∞ angle, similar to the Polo Grounds and various other parks of that era. It was bounded on the south by Brady Street, on the east by Beaubien Street, and on the west by Harper Hospital, beyond which lay John R Street. Brush Street made a T-intersection against Brady at the southwest corner of the lot where the main entrance gate was. For that reason, the location is often given as simply \\"Brady and Brush Streets.\\" Across the centerfield fence, to the north, was the other half of the Recreation Park complex, a cricket field. Contemporary maps depict an oval track around the cricket field, as with the baseball field, and a larger oval enclosing the entire property. The northern boundary of the property, according to initial contemporary newspaper accounts, was Fremont Street (now Canfield Street). Later accounts placed the northern border at Willis Street, a block south of Fremont / Canfield. Although the ballpark is long gone, Harper Hospital still exists, housed in new buildings, and overlooking the site where the major league Wolverines once played. An historical marker commemorating Recreation Park is placed in what was once left field, among the buildings of the present Detroit Medical Center. == References == == External links == * Images of Detroit's Recreation Park Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Sports venues in Detroit Category:Baseball venues in Michigan ","title":"Recreation Park (Detroit)"},{"id":"1296783","text":"Uthai Thani (, ) is a town (thesaban mueang) in Thailand, capital of the Uthai Thani Province, in the upper central region of the country.

ICU is widely portable to many operating systems and environments. It gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C, C++, and Java software. The ICU project is a technical committee of the Unicode Consortium and sponsored, supported, and used by IBM and many other companies. ICU provides the following services: Unicode text handling, full character properties, and character set conversions; Unicode regular expressions; full Unicode sets; character, word, and line boundaries; language-sensitive collation and searching; normalization, upper and lowercase conversion, and script transliterations; comprehensive locale data and resource bundle architecture via the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR); multi-calendar and time zones; and rule-based formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, currencies, and messages. ICU provided complex text layout service for Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Thai historically, but that was deprecated in version 54, and was completely removed in version 58 in favor of HarfBuzz. ICU provides more extensive internationalization facilities than the standard libraries for C and C++. ICU 67 supports Unicode 13.0 and handles removal of Great Britain from EU regions. ICU 64 supports Unicode 12.0, while ICU 64.2 added support for Unicode 12.1, i.e. the single new symbol for current Japanese Reiwa era (but support for it has also been backported to older ICU versions down to ICU 4.8.2). ICU 58 (with Unicode 9.0 support) is the last version to support older platforms such as Windows XP, Windows Vista. Support for AIX, Solaris and z/OS is also limited in later versions. ICU has historically used UTF-16, and still does only for Java; while for C/C++ UTF-8 is supported, including the correct handling of \\"illegal UTF-8\\". ==Origin and development== After Taligent became part of IBM in early 1996, Sun Microsystems decided that the new Java language should have better support for internationalization. Since Taligent had experience with such technologies and were close geographically, their Text and International group were asked to contribute the international classes to the Java Development Kit as part of the JDK 1.1 internationalization APIs. A large portion of this code still exists in the and packages. Further internationalization features were added with each later release of Java. The Java internationalization classes were then ported to C++ and C as part of a library known as ICU4C (\\"ICU for C\\"). The ICU project also provides ICU4J (\\"ICU for Java\\"), which adds features not present in the standard Java libraries. ICU4C and ICU4J are very similar, though not identical; for example, ICU4C includes a Regular Expression API, while ICU4J does not. Both frameworks have been enhanced over time to support new facilities and new features of Unicode and Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). ICU was released as an open-source project in 1999 under the name IBM Classes for Unicode. It was later renamed to International Components For Unicode. In May, 2016, the ICU project joined the Unicode consortium as technical committee ICU-TC, and the library sources are now distributed under the Unicode license. ==MessageFormat== A part of ICU is the MessageFormat class, a \\"localization 2.0\\" (l20n) formatting system that allows for any number of arguments to control the plural form (, ) or more general switch- case-style selection () for things like grammatical gender. These statements can be nested. A JavaScript port of this library is commonly used by Angular.js developers in combination with , so that the simple key-based library can handle nuanced localization inputs. An example for this system can look like: # Using YAML for simplicity of example. hello: Hello, {user}! # offset allows the categories to be subtracted by the specified amount before being processed. It does not, however, affect the exact-match system. party: {user} has invited {player_count, plural, offset:1, =0 {nobody} one {a player} other {# players}} to {user_gender, select, male {his}, female {her}, other {their}} party. // Using the simple form of https://messageformat.github.io/messageformat/page-build import msg from './example.yaml' function say(messageKey, options) { console.log(msg[messageKey](options)) } say('hello', {user: 'Jimmy'}) // Hello, Jimmy! say('party', {user: 'Whales', player_count: 5000, user_gender: 'male'}) // Whales has invited 4999 players to his game. say('party', {user: 'Dolphin', player_count: 20, user_gender: 'other'}) // Dolphin has invited 19 players to their game. say('party', {user: 'Elephant', player_count: 1, user_gender: 'female'}) // Elephant has invited nobody to her game. Note that ICU itself does not call MessageFormat a l20n system. The term comes from a JavaScript library of the same name by Mozilla with a similar functionality, which got replaced by another JavaScript system called \\"Fluent\\" later on. ICU MessageFormat was created by adding the plural and selection system to an identically-named system in Java SE. ==See also== * Apple Advanced Typography * Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging * GNU GetText * Graphite (SIL) * NetRexx (ICU license) * OpenType * Pango * Uconv * Uniscribe ==ReferencesInternational Components for Unicode transliteration services Category:Unicode Category:Component-based software engineering Category:Digital typography Category:Pattern matching Category:Internationalization and localization Category:Free computer libraries ","title":"International Components for Unicode"},{"id":"1296790","text":"Virginian is a demonym used to describe something as being of, from, or related to the Commonwealth of Virginia of the United States of America; it can be used as both a noun and adjective.

It is the second of the twelve Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes in most British editions of the canon, and the second of the eight stories from His Last Bow in most American versions. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in 1893. ==Synopsis== Miss Susan Cushing of Croydon receives a parcel in the post that contains two severed human ears packed in coarse salt. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience. Holmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, a cable to Liverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing's sister Sarah (Holmes was denied admittance by the doctor because she was having a \\"brain fever\\") convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing's other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary's estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings' house in Croydon (addressing it merely to \\"S. Cushing\\"), not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah (rather than Susan) because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover. Browner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes's information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reaches London. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story‚Äîmorally if not legally‚Äîis Sarah Cushing, who fell in love with and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband's propensity for getting drunk (and being rather rough when so intoxicated). In the end, her husband's inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Holmes considers a \\"crime of passion\\". ==Publication history== \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\" was published in Harper's Weekly on January 14, 1893. (An unrelated illustration by Louis Loeb precedes the story.) The story was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1893. It was first published in the US in Harper's Weekly on 14 January 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand in February 1893.Smith (2014), p. 75. In The Strand Magazine, the story included eight illustrations by Sidney Paget.Cawthorne (2011), p. 140. \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\" was not published in the first British edition of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, but it was published in the first American edition, though it was quickly removed because of its controversial subject matter. The story was later published again in American editions of His Last Bow, and put into British editions of the Memoirs. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place, within the Memoirs. When \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\" was removed from publication, Conan Doyle moved a passage from it that showed Holmes \\"mind reading\\" Watson to \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\". (The text of the moved passage runs from \\"Our blinds were half- drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa\\" to \\"I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day.\\") This passage reveals Dr. Watson to be an avid admirer of Henry Ward Beecher, whose portrait he keeps at his home. The passage seems to have little to do with the mystery but may be a subtle reference to the theme of adultery as Beecher was famously put on trial for the offense in 1875, an event many contemporary readers would have remembered. ==Adaptations== ===Film and television=== The was adapted as a short silent film titled The Cardboard Box in 1923, as one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. Hilda Anthony played Mary Browner and Johnny Butt played James Browner. The Granada TV adaptation with Jeremy Brett, televised on 11 April 1994, was generally faithful to the original. It contained some minor variations: in the story Browner kills his wife and her lover at sea whereas in the adaptation he kills them near a pond; and the adaptation places the action at Christmas time in the midst of a cold and snowy winter, while the original story took place in high summer (\\"...a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an oven\\"). Holmes's eloquent speech at the end of the episode questions the very nature of humanity. He asks toward what end mortals pursue \\"this circle of misery, violence, and fear\\", concluding that \\"it must have a purpose, or else our universe has no meaning, which is unthinkable. But what purpose? That, is humanity's great problem, to which reason so far, has no answer.\\" This was the last episode broadcast, and includes Brett in ill health at the end of his run as the famous detective. The Elementary episode \\"Ears to You\\" is a loose adaptation of this story. The setup for this episode is very similar to that story‚Äîtwo human ears are mailed to someone, packed in salt‚Äîbut includes several variations, including the twist that the ears were actually sent by the supposed victim, who underwent a complex experiment to literally grow fake ears on her back so as to frame the primary suspect for her murder. The 2018 HBO Asia/Hulu Japan series Miss Sherlock loosely adapts this story as the episode \\"Stella Maris.\\" As the series is set in Tokyo, the misleading address on the box containing the ear in the original story is adapted as a mailing label with unclearly written katakana. ===Radio=== The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired on 5 November 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 39. Another production of the story aired in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 76. Meiser also adapted the story for The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for episodes that aired in January 1940Dickerson (2019), p. 89. and August 1943Dickerson (2019), pp. 130‚Äì131. with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes and Nigel Bruce playing Watson. The story was adapted for the BBC Light Programme in 1960 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. \\"The Cardboard Box\\" was dramatised by Roger Danes for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 as an episode of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson (in the series for His Last Bow). It featured Kevin Whately as Browner and Teresa Gallagher as Mary Browner; it also introduced Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade, who had previously been played by Donald Gee. In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * Category:1893 short stories Cardboard Box, The Category:Works originally published in The Strand Magazine Category:Works originally published in Harper's Weekly ","title":"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"},{"id":"1296849","text":"Euskirchen () is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, capital of the district Euskirchen. While Euskirchen resembles a modern shopping town, it also has a history dating back over 700 years, having been granted town status in 1302. As of December 2007, it had a population of 55,446. Euskirchen, old market (Alter Markt). ==Culture== Parts of the ancient town wall, and three of its defensive towers, are still standing. Tourists are also attracted to Euskirchen due to the proximity of two large cities, Cologne and Bonn, to the northeast, and the hills of the Eifel region to the south. It is also the birthplace of Emil Fischer, born 1852, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902. The local theatre in The Emil-Fischer-Gymnasium offers a wide variety of cultural events. The City Forum and the Parkhotel Euskirchenwww.parkhotel- euskirchen.com also contribute to the town's cultural offerings. The word Euskirchen means Kirche auf der Aue (‚Äúchurch on riverside lowland‚Äù). The Martinskirche is the oldest church in Euskirchen. Biggest local sports clubs in Euskirchen are the TSC Euskirchen, LGO Euskirchen/Erftstadt and Lauf Club Euskirchen. Sports facilities are the Erftstadion, gym Ohm-Mirgel, Jahnhalle, Willi-Maurer-Halle, gym Emil-Fischer-Gymnasium, Sportanlage Im Auel (since 2021 Heinz-Flohe-Sportpark) and gym Marienschule. ==Twinnings== Euskirchen is twinned with the following towns: * Basingstoke & Deane, United Kingdom, since 1986 * Charleville-M√©zi√®res, France, since 1964 ==Industry and Commerce== Euskirchen has a diversified and balanced economic structure and can therefore provide jobs for a large catchment area. Euskirchen is a rural town with large, open fields serving agricultural purposes. Sugar beets are widely cultivated, and Euskirchen has been home to a sugar factory (Pfeifer & Langen) since 1879. Until a few decades ago, a further important branch of industry was cloth manufacturing, but this was unable to survive due to competition from large international corporations. Well-known industrial enterprises (e.g. Procter & Gamble, Miele) are located within the town's industrial and commercial sites. These can also offer attractive possibilities to new enterprises. The town's central location and good road and rail links to the international transport network are important factors in this context. The two largest industrial and commercial sites in Euskirchen, accounting for a total of 21,000 jobs between them, are: * IPAS (‚ÄúIndustriePark Am Silberberg‚Äù) with four million m¬≤, of which 3.6 m¬≤ million lie within the boundary of the town of Euskirchen * EURO-Park (located between Euskirchen and Roitzheim) with 1.5 million m¬≤. At IPAS, in the districts W√ºschheim/Gro√üb√ºllesheim, the consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble has a production plant as well as a warehouse from which it conducts its logistics operations all over the world. At EURO-Park the German company Nestl√© Purina PetCare (pet food) and the ‚ÄúT-Versand‚Äù division of Deutsche Telekom have their headquarters, the sugar factory Pfeifer & Langen is based at EURO-Park and the building materials chain Mobau (‚ÄúModerner Baubedarf‚Äù) ‚Äì which has now merged into Eurobaustoff ‚Äì was established.

He was also a creative inventor of new devices which were widely adopted in clinical medicine and physiological research. Marxow studied medicine in the University of Vienna, Austria. He started his scientific career as a research assistant in the laboratory of Ernst Wilhelm von Br√ºcke (1819‚Äì1892), and later as an assistant, in the same university, to the eminent pathologist Carl von Rokitansky (1804-1878). However, an accident while he was dissecting a cadaver injured his thumb, which became infected and had to be amputated, interrupting his activities in anatomical pathology. Thus, he had to turn to physiology, and he came back to von Br√ºcke's laboratory in Vienna after studying for a year with Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), another famous physiologist at the University of Leipzig, Germany, obtaining his doctoral degree in medicine in 1874. In the first phase of his career in neurophysiology, Marxow dedicated himself to electrophysiology of nerves and muscles, then a research field of increasing prestige, after the pioneering investigations of Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896), who had discovered the action potentials of axons. This field highly benefited from the technical developments occurring in the physical sciences, particularly new devices which were invented to work with small electric potentials and currents. Since biological tissues have extremely low levels of electrical activity (in the range of microvolts), neurophysiology's progress had to wait for them. Like many German physiologists of his time, Marxow had a good knowledge and ability with physics, and invented a number of devices for the purpose of his studies, particularly the reonome (a kind of rheostat, or variable resistor used to control finely the intensity of an electrical stimulus). He also adapted the Lippmann's capillary electrometer in order to use it for measuring subtle bioelectrical phenomena. From the bioelectricity of nerves, Marxow turned his attention, from 1876 on, to the global electrical activity of the cerebral hemispheres. Neuroanatomists had already determined at the time that its nervous tissue was also composed of cells (the neurons), with their bodies mainly located in the gray matter, and filamentary prolongations, the dendrites and the axons. Thus, it was only natural to assume that they would also display electrical activity. This important discovery, however, had not been made until that time, because many desynchronized electrical potentials with different polarities produce a cumulative global potential which is actually very small and difficult to detect with the sensitivity range of the measuring devices available at the time. Despite this, Marxow was able to prove for the first time that the peripheral stimulation of sensory organs, such as vision and hearing were able to provoke event-related small electrical potential swings on the surface of the cerebral cortex which was related to the projection of those senses. Strangely, however, Marxow did not publish his results, choosing instead to deposit them in a bank safe, with instructions to reveal them in 1883 only. Meanwhile, the first publications about what was later to be called the electroencephalogram came to light, independently demonstrated by Richard Caton (1842‚Äì1926), in Great Britain, and Adolf Beck (1863‚Äì1942) in Poland, both using laboratory animals. In 1880, Marxows became a full professor at the University of Vienna and was nominated a correspondent member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He also devoted part of his research to physiological optics, making important discoveries on the distribution of the optic nerve on the retina, and the optical characteristics of the cornea. With his increasing knowledge in optical physics, he developed several optical measurement instruments, such as a spectropolarimeter and a hematometer (a device used for measuring the content of hemoglobin in the blood), which was named in his honor, and which for many years found wide application in laboratory medicine and diagnostic hematology. For many years, Marxow labored under intense personal suffering, due to chronic painful complications of his amputation. Because of this, he became addicted to morphine and heroin (a synthetic derivative of morphine, but much more potent). Sigmund Freud, then a Viennese neurologist, was one of his most intimate friends, and had the highest opinion of him: At the time Freud was studying the medical properties of cocaine, and was convinced that cocaine could be not only used as mild euphoriant, aphrodisiac and analgesic, but also as a treatment for morphine addicts. He recommended this to his friend Marxow, who proceeded to fall even deeper into the abyss of addiction. Devastated by pain, addiction, and disease, he relapsed and began using morphine again. Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow died on October 22, 1891, at 45 years of age.

Porky gets a cat to catch the mouse, only for the cat to get bound and launched out of the house. Next Porky borrows a mountain lion, but the mouse has petrified, stuffed and mounted the lion.

The mouse retaliates at the robot cat, which flawless being unaffected by a bowling ball, a flamethrowing boiler, dynamite and a pistol shot. The robot cat then blocks the mouse's ways into the mouse holes. The robot cat further resists the mouse's tricks from electrocution, more flamethrowing, decapitation and battering. Finally the mouse blows up the robot cat with a dynamite laced clockwork mouse, destroying Porky's house.

It is largely used to gather heart rate data while performing various types of physical exercise. Measuring electrical heart information is referred to as Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG). Medical heart rate monitoring used in hospitals is usually wired and usually multiple sensors are used. Portable medical units are referred to as a Holter monitor. Consumer heart rate monitors are designed for everyday use and do not use wires to connect. ==History== Early models consisted of a monitoring box with a set of electrode leads which attached to the chest. The first wireless EKG heart rate monitor was invented in 1977 by Polar Electro as a training aid for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski team. As \\"intensity training\\" became a popular concept in athletic circles in the mid-80s, retail sales of wireless personal heart monitors started in 1983.Burke, E (ed) Precision Heart Rate Training == Technologies == X-ray image of a chest strap (left: frontal view; right: side view). Visible is the circuit board, the antenna for data transfer, the battery and the connections to the electrodes in the adjoining belt at picture top and bottom. Modern heart rate monitors commonly use one of two different methods to record heart signals (electrical and optical). Both types of signals can provide the same basic heart rate data, using fully automated algorithms to measure heart rate, such as the Pan- Tompkins algorithm. ECG (Electrocardiography) sensors measure the bio- potential generated by electrical signals that control the expansion and contraction of heart chambers, typically implemented in medical devices. PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensors use a light-based technology to measure the blood volume controlled by the heart's pumping action. ===Electrical=== The electrical monitors consist of two elements: a monitor/transmitter, which is worn on a chest strap, and a receiver. When a heartbeat is detected a radio signal is transmitted, which the receiver uses to display/determine the current heart rate. This signal can be a simple radio pulse or a unique coded signal from the chest strap (such as Bluetooth, ANT, or other low-power radio links). Newer technology prevents one user's receiver from using signals from other nearby transmitters (known as cross-talk interference) or eavesdropping. Note the older Polar 5.1 kHz radio transmission technology is usable underwater. Both Bluetooth and Ant+ use the 2.4 GHz radio band, which cannot send signals underwater. ===Optical=== More recent devices use optics to measure heart rate by shining light from an LED through the skin and measuring how it scatters off blood vessels. In addition to measuring the heart rate, some devices using this technology are able to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Some recent optical sensors can also transmit data as mentioned above. Newer devices such as cell phones or watches can be used to display and/or collect the information. Some devices can simultaneously monitor heart rate, oxygen saturation, and other parameters. These may include sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to detect speed, location and distance. In recent years, it has been common for smartwatches to include heart rate monitors, which has greatly increased popularity. Some smart watches, smart bands and cell phones often use PPG sensors. ===Fitness Metrics=== Garmin, Polar Electro, Suunto and Fitbit are vendors selling consumer heart rate products. Most companies use their own proprietary heart rate algorithms. ==Accuracy== The newer, wrist based heart rate monitors have achieved almost identical levels of accuracy as their chest strap counterparts with independent tests showing up to 95% accuracy, but sometimes more than 30% error can persist for several minutes.Haskins, Tristan Chest Strap Vs Wrist Based HR Accuracy Optical devices when used with rigorous activity can be less accurate or when used underwater. Currently heart rate variability is less available on optical devices. Apple introduced HRV data collection to the Apple Watch devices in 2018. ==See also== *Apple Watch *GPS watch *Activity tracker *Pedometer *eHealth *E-textiles ==References== ==External links== * Category:Biomedical engineering Category:Exercise equipment Category:Medical monitoring equipment Category:Physiological instruments Category:Finnish inventions ","title":"Heart rate monitor"},{"id":"1296865","text":"L√©on Gozlan (11 September 1803 ‚Äì 14 September 1866) was a 19th-century French novelist and playwright. ==Life== When he was still a boy, his father, who had made a large fortune as a ship-broker, met with a series of misfortunes, and L√©on, before completing his education, had to go to sea in order to earn a living. In 1828 we find him in Paris, determined to run the risks of literary life.

He captained India in 14 matches between 1951 and 1953. In India's 25th Test match, nearly 20 years after India achieved Test status, he led India to its first ever Test cricket win (and the only victory under his captaincy) in 1951‚Äì52 against England at Madras, winning by an innings and eight runs in a match that began on the day that King George VI died. ==Early life== Hazare was born in Sangli, in the then Bombay Presidency of British India in 1915, one of eight children of a school teacher. Primarily a right- hand batsman, Hazare was also a right-hand medium-pace bowler. A \\"shy, retiring\\" man (according to Wisden in 1952), it was widely thought that he was not a natural captain and that his batting suffered as a result. His rival, Vijay Merchant said that the captaincy prevented Hazare from becoming India's finest batsman: \\"It was one of the tragedies of cricket.\\" Even so, Hazare's Test record is very respectable: he amassed 2,192 runs in 30 Test matches with a batting average of 47.65. His first-class record is even more impressive, with a batting average of 58.38 for his 18,740 runs (highest first-class aggregate for an Indian player after Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid). He scored 60 first-class centuries (including 7 in Tests), the fourth highest for an Indian player and 10 first-class double centuries (including six during World War II, when India was the only Test cricket- playing country to continue holding its domestic first-class cricket competition without interruption). His bowling record was more modest, and he took 595 first-class wickets (including 20 in Tests, and Donald Bradman's wicket three times) at a bowling average of 24.61. On the Indian domestic circuit, Hazare played for the Maharashtra, Central India and Baroda teams. Some of his notable achievements include: *First Indian batsman to score a triple century in first-class cricket (considering KS Duleepsinhji as an English cricketer) *First Indian to score two triple centuries: **the first, his highest score, was 316 not out for Maharashtra against Poona in 1939‚Äì40 **the second was 309 out of 387 for The Rest against The Hindus at Bombay in 1943‚Äì44. Despite his innings, The Rest lost the match by an innings. It included a partnership of 300 with his brother, Vivek Hazare. Vijay scored 266 (88.6% of the partnership) of the 300 runs while Vivek contributed 21. Hazare scored 79.84% of his team's score, then a world record, and it is the second highest individual score in a losing cause. The Rest's total is the smallest completed innings to contain a triple century. *First Indian to score a century in each innings of a Test match (116 and 145 on successive days against Australia in Adelaide in 1947‚Äì48, which was the same team that became known as The Invincibles) *Against England at Kanpur in 1951‚Äì52, Hazare also became the first Indian batsman to score a pair (a duck in both innings) *First Indian player to score a century in three successive Test matches *First Indian player to make fifty centuries in his first class career *Highest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket (577 runs with Gul Mahomed for Baroda against Holkar in the final of the Ranji Trophy at Baroda in 1947. This record stood for many years, and was only broken in 2006 by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put on 624 for Sri Lanka against South Africa. *First Indian player to complete 1000 Test Runs Vijay Hazare's career performance graph. In retirement, he was for a short while an Indian Test cricket selector. He has been honoured with a trophy in his name, the Vijay Hazare Trophy, a zonal-cricket tournament in India. He died in December 2004 following prolonged illness caused by intestinal cancer. He and Jasu Patel were the first cricketers to be honoured with the Padma Shri. ==References== ==External links== *Obituary, The Times, 20 December 2004, page 44 *Cricinfo Player Profile : Vijay Samuel Hazare *rediff.com Factfile ‚Äì Vijay Hazare * Vijay Hazare photos and articles *Former Indian captain Hazare dies (BBC, 18 December 2004) *Obituary (The Hindu, 19 December 2004) * Obituary (The Times, 20 December 2004) *Obituary (The Guardian, 20 December 2004) Category:India Test cricketers Category:Indian cricketers Category:India Test cricket captains Category:Baroda cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:Central India cricketers Category:Maharashtra cricketers Category:West Zone cricketers Category:The Rest cricketers Category:Marathi people Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in sports Category:People from Sangli Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:1915 births Category:2004 deaths Category:India national cricket team selectors ","title":"Vijay Hazare"},{"id":"1296905","text":"The film (public domain) A Tale of Two Kitties is a 1942 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, written by Warren Foster, and features music by Carl W. Stalling. The short was released on November 21, 1942, and features Tweety in his debut, who delivers the line that would become his catchphrase: \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\\" ==Plot== Two cats, Babbit and Catstello, are looking for food to alleviate their hunger. Babbit gets a ladder when they see a bird. Catstello is at first reluctant, but manages to go up the ladder. After several failed attempts, Babbit and Catstello construct a makeshift glider and try to swoop down and catch the bird, but the bird reports an air raid, followed by a blackout, and Catstello is shut down. The bird walks by, and just as Babbit and Catstello are about to catch him, the bird screams at the cats to \\"TURN OUT THOSE LIGHTS!\\" ==Voice cast== *Mel Blanc as Tweety and Catstello *Tedd Pierce as Babbit ==Home media== *(1988) VHS - Cartoon Moviestars: Tweety and Sylvester *(1991) VHS - The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 2: Firsts *(1991) LaserDisc - The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 1,Side 2: Firsts *(2005) DVD - They Died With Their Boots On, Blue Ribbon reissue titles, 1995 Turner dubbed version *(2007) DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5, Disc 3 *(2007) DVD - Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection: Volume 5, Disc 2 *(2011) Blu-ray, DVD - Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1, Disc 1 *(2020) Streaming - HBO Max ==Production notes== *This short subject is notable for being Tweety's debut, although the bird was known as Orson in this short, according to the staff. The cartoon was also the first appearance of Babbit and Catstello, based on the popular comedy duo Abbott and Costello. The title is an obvious pun on the Charles Dickens classic, A Tale of Two Cities. *Even in this initial appearance, Tweety reveals early on that his cute appearance masks a willingness to be merciless, even sadistic, towards anyone who threatens him. After slipping one of the cats a bomb which explodes (offscreen), the bird remarks, \\"Aw, da poor putty tat‚Äîhe cwushed his widdow head!\\" Followed by a big grin. (This line was patterned after a catchphrase from a Red Skelton character, and would be used in other Warner cartoons, such as Easter Yeggs.) This is one of the few Tweety shorts that did not feature his main antagonist Sylvester, who would make his official debut in Life with Feathers (1945). *A Tale of Two Kitties is remarkable for a clearly adult reference in 1942. Catstello, breaking the fourth wall, takes a direct shot at the Hays Office, making a thinly-veiled reference to giving the middle finger. *The short was reissued as a Blue Ribbon cartoon on July 31, 1948. Associated Artists Productions acquired the short's distribution rights for television. United Artists, the successor of A.A.P.'s ownership, failed to renew the copyright in time in 1970, so the short is now in the public domain in the United States. As such, it can be found on bootleg home video VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray sets. ==See also== * List of films in the public domain in the United States * List of animated films in the public domain in the United States ==References* * A Tale of Two Kitties at Cinemaniacal Category:1942 animated films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

Formed in 2000, the band was named after founder and leader Jeff Rains. The band has released two studio albums and one EP as of 2019. ==History== Hailing from a small town in northern Indiana (U.S.A.), Jeff RAINS understands the meaning of hard work, struggles, and life‚Äôs challenges. The talented artist is driven, serious, and committed to his beautiful young family and his musical career. Featuring Joe Schultz on drums, Matt Hopkins on bass, and Jason Anderson on guitar, RAINS commands the stage with a powerful sound and raw emotion that draws the audience in from the first phrase. RAINS is a band for the people, and, it‚Äôs about time. People need a band to get behind, and, a band to believe in; they need a band that can make them proud. Nothing trendy ‚Äì something real. Stories, the debut album from RAINS, offers a window into the heart and soul of ‚Äúthe American Dream.‚Äù The expressive lyrics reveal that Jeff Rains is wise beyond his years, a keen observer of life and human behavior. The first single, \\"Liar\\", was a Top 15 hit on SiriusXM Octane, with the follow up singles ‚ÄúLook In My Eyes‚Äù and ‚ÄúPressure‚Äù hitting #3 and #1 on SiriusXM Octane and charted in the top 30 on Active Rock Radio. The album has garnered over 20 million streams on Spotify, as well as millions of streams and views on platforms such as YouTube and iTunes. After 8 years of constant touring with bands such as Five Finger Death Punch and Black Stone Cherry as well as numerous headlining tours, Rains decided to take some time off to focus on his daughter and his tattoo company, as well as begin the writing process for his new album. Since starting the project at age 15 Rains has been committed to staying an independent artist throughout his career and has stuck to that philosophy with his latest release N.F.D.M. Rains began recording his new album N.F.D.M at House Of Blues Studios in Nashville TN in March of 2019 and released the first single ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù on December 6, 2019. Rains is a multi- instrumentalist and visionary, whose talent is evident with each new album. Rains will be touring in support of ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù in early 2020. ==Band members== * Jeff Rains ==Discography== ===Studio album=== *Stories (Jan 2, 2010) *From The Ashes (Jan 14, 2014) *N.F.D.M (April

Geo. Grauer Brewery‚Äù and ‚ÄúGerken‚Äôs Colosium‚Äù. Ridgewood Park, also known as Wallace's Ridgewood Park or the Wallace Grounds, and frequently confused with Grauer's Ridgewood Park, was a baseball ground in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. Both Wallace's and Grauer's are shown in Belcher Hyde's Map of Newtown in 1915. The baseball field was part of a larger entertainment area bounded Wyckoff Avenue, Covert Street, Halsey Street, and Irving Avenue. (Halsey Street also bordered the old Capitoline Grounds about west.) The baseball field was southwest of the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch tracks. Eldert Street, although depicted on the map as running through the baseball grounds, was not cut through southwest of the railroad tracks and the road remains interrupted there today. Originally the park was in Queens County, before its incorporation into New York City in 1899. This facilitated Sunday baseball playing, including the charging of admission, beyond the reach of Sabbath enforcers from the then- city of Brooklyn. Grauer's Ridgewood Park or Grauer's Woods was a large parkland several blocks north of Wallace's ballpark, bounded by Myrtle Avenue, Cypress Avenue, Seneca Avenue, and Decatur Street. Although some baseball was played here, this area was more of a picnic park. George Schubel in 1913 lyrically describes the pleasures of Grauer's Ridgewood Park: \\"Here the German families of another generation assembled and enjoyed themselves in innocent recreation very much in the manner that they were accustomed to do across the seas. Most of these parks have been eliminated, owing to the increase in land values and the decline of this sort of amusement.\\" He also notes that \\"This once beautiful park is now cut up with such streets as Centre Street, George Street, Norman Street, Summerfield Street, and Willow Street, running through the land.\\" The land that would become Ridgewood Park was purchased by William Wallace in 1884. On April 5, 1885, the first game was played between the Brooklyn Atlantics and the Ridgewoods before a reported 3,000 fans. According to Retrosheet, Ridgewood Park was used by the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers from 1887-1889 after they had played some games in the 1886 season at Grauer's. The Dodgers had used it strictly for Sunday games, to get around Brooklyn's blue laws. The Brooklyn Gladiators played their full 1890 schedule at Wallace's. The field was home to the semipro Ridgewoods; later the Brooklyn Bushwicks and the Negro League Brooklyn Royal Giants also played there. On September 19, 1917, the grandstand burned, precipitating the Bushwicks' move to Dexter Park in 1918. Wallace apparently intended to subdivide the land put it up for sale in that year, but ultimately he would rebuild, and the property was not sold until 1927. Although it was gradually reduced in size, the park survived and hosted soccer and other sports as Grand Stadium until 1959, when it was replaced by industrial buildings. Grand Stadium once again played host to the Dodgers as a training site in its waning years. The Eagle reported on February 26, 1947, that Branch Rickey \\"looked refreshed on his arrival at Grand Stadium to watch the 20 who had been tempted [by Mexican promoter Pasquel's contract offers] and 30 other Dodgers go through their long drill.\\" Although this passing reference does not conclusively establish the connection, it seems that the Dodgers returned briefly to their old stomping grounds some 60 years later. ==References== ==External links== *BrooklynBallParks.com Category:Baseball venues in New York City Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Former sports venues in New York City Category:Ridgewood, Queens Category:Soccer venues in New York City Category:Sports venues in Queens, New York ","title":"Ridgewood Park (baseball ground)"},{"id":"1296931","text":"Albert Dean Rosellini (January 21, 1910 - October 10, 2011) was an American politician who served as the 15th governor of the state of Washington for two terms, from 1957 to 1965, and was both the first Italian-American and Roman Catholic governor elected west of the Mississippi River. During a political career that spanned 40 years, Rosellini was an activist leader who worked to reform the state's prisons and mental health facilities, expand the state highway system, create the University of Washington's medical and dental schools, and build the second floating bridge across Lake Washington. Rosellini holds the record as the longest-lived U.S. state governor in American history, having reached the age of . ==Early life and education== Born in Tacoma, Washington, Rosellini was the only son of Italian immigrants, Annunziata (Pagni) and Giovanni Rosellini, a saloon operator.https://italoamericano.org/story/2016-7-1/rosellini- cousinshttps://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/albert-rosellini-dies- ex-wash-governor-led-reforms-of-prisons-and-mental- hospitals/2011/10/10/gIQAn7R9aL_story.html He worked his way through college and law school at the University of Washington, graduating in 1933 with his classmate Hugh J. Rosellini (no relation), a childhood friend and later state Supreme Court justice. ==Career== ===Washington Senate=== At the age of 29, Rosellini was elected to the state senate as its youngest member, representing the 33rd district in south Seattle, the home of many Italian immigrants. A New Deal Democrat, Rosellini served from 1939 to 1957, and rose to the rank of majority leader. He was elected governor in 1956. ===Governorship=== campaign sign at Seattle's Blue Moon Tavern in 2007 Evergreen Point Bridge under construction in 1962. As governor, Rosellini coupled personal charm with decades of political know-how, developing a reputation for decisiveness and ability to move ahead on long-stalled projects. Don Hannula, longtime political columnist for The Seattle Times, wrote in 1996, \\"He was not a man of empty rhetoric. He got things done. His legacy is everywhere.\\" In his 1997 biography, Rosellini, Immigrant's Son and Progressive Governor, author Payton Smith wrote: \\"He was attracted to issues where progress could be made and measured . . . Budget reform, economic development, transportation, higher education and institutions were the core matters to which he devoted his talent and governmental know-how.\\" Rosellini was narrowly re-elected in 1960, beating Republican Lloyd J. Andrews by a margin of 1.4 percent. In order to promote economic development, Rosellini established a state department of commerce and championed the Seattle World's Fair in 1962. He shepherded construction of the former longest floating bridge in the world, the original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, which opened in 1963 and carried State Route 520 over Lake Washington from Seattle to Medina. After 53 years of service, it was replaced by a new floating bridge at the same site in 2016. The original bridge was later named after him, and its replacement also bears his name. In addition, he was a tireless supporter of higher education, strengthening the state university system and developing a system of junior colleges. During his time in office, Rosellini also reformed the state budget process and balanced the budget. ===1964 gubernatorial election=== Rosellini was defeated in his bid for a third term in 1964 by Republican Daniel J. Evans, a state legislator and civil engineer. Rosellini entered the primary unopposed by his ostensive rivals for the Democratic nomination, Lieutenant Governor John Cherberg or Attorney General John J. O'Connell, but did encounter opposition from several unknown candidates who collectively garnered close to 50,000 votes. The general election campaign was marked by bruising attacks on the candidate's integrity from both the Republican and Democratic camps. Governor Rosellini attempted to portray Evans as a supporter of Barry Goldwater and his record as antithetical to the interests of labor, welfare, and education. Evans in turn charged Rosellini with financial impropriety and cronyism, alleging that the Governor solicited campaign funds from businesses under contract with the state government. Only one televised debate was agreed between the two candidates. The coattails of President Johnson did not extend to this race, as the 39-year-old Evans won by double digits. ===1972 attempted comeback=== Rosellini made a comeback bid eight years later in 1972; he captured the Democratic nomination, but was again defeated overwhelmingly by Evans. Starting with a lead in the polls, Rosellini saw his support fall when he disparagingly referred to Governor Evans as \\"Danny Boy\\" and being accused of intervening on behalf of his friend Frank Colacurcio to obtain a club license in Hawaii while in office. A minority of Evans' supporters also began to sport bumper stickers on the back of their cars stating \\"We Don't Need A Godfather,\\" described by his daughter Lynn Rosellini as extremely hurtful to her father given his pride over his Italian ancestry. (The popular Oscar-winning film The Godfather was released earlier that year.) ===Consultant and elder statesman=== After leaving office in 1965, Rosellini returned to the practice of law, and also became a political consultant, specializing in matters of the liquor and entertainment industries. Over the years, Rossellini served as an elder statesman of the state Democratic Party, mentoring political figures including Washington governors Christine Gregoire and Gary Locke. In 2003, Rosellini was back in the news briefly when he was reported to have delivered campaign contributions to Seattle City Council members on behalf of strip-club owners, one of whom was a convicted racketeer. Rosellini was never charged in the scandal that became known as \\"Strippergate.\\" Until his death, Rosellini attended fundraisers for candidates and helped raise money for charities, particularly the Washington State Olympics Committee, which he chaired for many years. Danny Westneat, columnist for The Seattle Times, wrote in 2005, \\"His record makes most governors after him look like slackers.\\" == Personal life == Rosellini and his wife Ethel (1922‚Äì2002), whom he married in 1937, had five children. Ethel died in 2002, after 64 years of marriage. Albert and Ethel had a close, affectionate, and happy marriage, and the two were known for their devotion to each other. Rosellini was a practicing Catholic. ==Later years and death== Rosellini celebrated his 100th birthday in January 2010, becoming one of the few U.S. state governors ever to reach the age of 100. He died of complications related to pneumonia in Seattle on October 10, 2011 at the age of 101. Rosellini's funeral was at St. James Cathedral in Seattle, and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery, alongside his wife. ==References== ==External links== *Seattle Times obituary * - - - - Category:1910 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American centenarians Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Disease-related deaths in Washington (state) Category:Governors of Washington (state) Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Infectious disease deaths in Washington (state) Category:Italian-American culture in Washington (state) Category:Politicians from Tacoma, Washington Category:Candidates in the 1960 United States presidential election Category:University of Washington School of Law alumni Category:Washington (state) Democrats Category:Washington (state) state senators Category:Catholics from Washington (state) ","title":"Albert Rosellini"},{"id":"1296943","text":"Life with Feathers is a 1945 Warner Bros.

The title is a play on the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway, Life with Father (the title being the only connection between the two works). Warner Bros. would produce a film version in 1947. ==Plot== A lovebird decides to commit suicide after his wife kicks him out of their nest and gets a cat named Sylvester to eat him, but he thinks the bird is poisonous and refuses to eat him. For the rest of the cartoon, the lovebird attempts to get Sylvester to eat him many times. The cartoon ends with the lovebird getting a telegram saying his wife is moving out, so he escapes from Sylvester in order to keep himself from being eaten. When he gets home, he finds out she has decided to stay, and he starts looking for the Sylvester again in order to get himself eaten. ==Cast== * Mel Blanc as Sylvester the Cat, Lovebird, Telegram Guy * Sara Berner as Sweety Puss, Woman * Danny Webb as Radio Announcer ==Availability== *VHS ‚Äì Cartoon Moviestars: Tweety and Sylvester *LaserDisc ‚Äì The Golden Age of Looney Tunes, Volume 1, Side 2: Firsts. *VHS ‚Äì The Golden Age of Looney Tunes, Vol. 2: Firsts *Blu- Ray, DVD ‚Äì Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3, Disc 2. ==Notes== *Life with Feathers featured the first appearance of Sylvester.

It is also the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde. ==Geography== ===Location=== The town lies in the Nahegebiet (Nahe area), to the north of the namesake river, on the edge of the Naturpark Saar-Hunsr√ºck. Birkenfeld lies roughly 13 km southwest of Idar-Oberstein and 12 km northwest of Baumholder. ===Neighbouring municipalities=== Clockwise from the north, these are Gollenberg, Elchweiler, Schmi√überg, Rimsberg, Dienstweiler, Ellweiler, Dambach, Br√ºcken, Buhlenberg and Ellenberg. ==History== The name Birkenfeld has its origin in an old German dialect, Old Frankish. It means something rather like ‚Äúat the field with the birches‚Äù (it is directly cognate with the English words ‚Äúbirch field‚Äù). From the name's Frankish roots it can be inferred that today's town arose on a spot where there was quite a noticeable stand of birch trees sometime about the year AD 500, and that it was founded by Frankish-German farmers. To this day, there are a great number of birch trees in the bird conservation area at the clay quarries. The first attestation of the name is spelled Bikenuelt (about 700) or Birkinvelt at the time when it had a documentary mention from Archbishop of Trier Egbert in 981. From this document comes knowledge that Saint Leudwinus (Archbishop of Trier 695-713) had donated to the St. Paulinus' Abbey in Trier the churches at Birkenfeld and Brombach. Archaeological finds from the Iron Age, however, bear witness to quite heavy settlement even in the 8th century BC. In the 1st century BC, Roman legions overran the area, and for 400 years, it lay under Roman rule. This is known mainly from finds made in the town's immediate vicinity. The town that is now Birkenfeld lies right on a Roman road that served as a crosslink between two important military roads, namely the Metz-Mainz road to the south and the Trier-Bingen-Mainz road to the north, which was mentioned by Roman poet Ausonius in his Mosella in AD 350, and which also corresponds along some stretches with the Hunsr√ºckh√∂henstra√üe (‚ÄúHunsr√ºck Heights Road‚Äù, a scenic road across the Hunsr√ºck built originally as a military road on Hermann G√∂ring‚Äôs orders). This crosslink, also known as the Bronzestra√üe (‚ÄúBronze Road‚Äù), linked the Glan, Nohen and the Moselle with each other. The Bronzestra√üe crossed the Nahe in Nohen (villa Aldena) and ran farther on, right through the Wasserschieder Wald, a state forest that still stands today on the town's outskirts, by way of Gollenberg, by B√∂rfink and on towards Trier. The Frankish settlement of Birkinvelt was held in the 13th century by the Counts of Sponheim. In 1223, the county was split into the ‚ÄúFront‚Äù and ‚ÄúRear‚Äù Counties of Sponheim, and Birkenfeld passed to the latter, and was then held by the counts whose seat was at the Starkenburg (castle, now a ruin) near Trarbach. In 1293, Castle Birkenfeld had its first documentary mention. In 1332, Birkenfeld was granted town rights by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. After the last Count of Sponheim died in 1437, the ‚ÄúRear‚Äù County was inherited by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz. In 1584, a House of Wittelsbach sideline, in the person of Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld, resided in town. In this same year, expansion work also began on the castle to turn it into a princely residence in the Renaissance style. Exactly 140 years later, the last remnants of the Princely holding of court at Schloss Birkenfeld, as it had come to be known, were swept away. During the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), the town itself became in 1635 a theatre of war. Also that year, the Plague broke out in Birkenfeld and claimed 416 lives. In 1776, under Margrave Karl Friedrich, Birkenfeld became seat of the Badish Oberamt. In this time, Birkenfeld blossomed. The town experienced an economic and cultural upswing. In 1779, for instance, the first ‚ÄúHigher School‚Äù was founded. In Napoleon's time, in 1798, the Rhine‚Äôs left bank was ceded to France, whereafter Birkenfeld belonged to the Department of Sarre. One night in February 1797, Johannes B√ºckler, known as Schinderhannes, burgled a cloth factory owned by the Brothers Stumm, who would later become coal and steel entrepreneurs on the Saar. A large part of the cloth stolen during this break-in Schinderhannes sold to a fence in Hundheim.Peter Bayerlein: Schinderhannes-Ortslexikon, S. 38, Mainz-Kostheim 2003 After the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), the Principality of Birkenfeld was awarded to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in 1817 for the contribution of Peter I, then regent of Oldenburg, to the military effort against Napoleon. Under Oldenburg rule, the new palatial castle, which is now the district administration‚Äôs seat, was built in 1821. Not only was this built, but so were further buildings in the Governmental Quarter (Regierungsviertel), such as the infantry barracks (until 1963, a Gymnasium building, now the local office for the regulation of expenditures caused by stationed forces), which to this day characterize the town‚Äôs appearance with their Classicist style from Oldenburg times. In the time of the Third Reich, the town became on 1 April 1937 part of the Prussian district of Birkenfeld, which was formed out of the former Oldenburg holdings and the Restkreis (roughly ‚Äúremnant district‚Äù) of the former exclave of Saxe-Coburg from 1814 to 1834, St. Wendel-Baumholder (this designation as a Restkreis had arisen from its being what had been left of the Sankt Wendel district on the Prussian side of the border once the Territory of the Saar Basin had been formed under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles). After the Second World War, Birkenfeld belonged to the French zone of occupation, and since 1946, it has been a district seat in Rhineland- Palatinate. ==Religion== In 2008, 50% of the town's inhabitants were Evangelical and 31% were Catholic.KommWis, Stand: 31. Dezember 2008 Besides these two biggest groups, there are an Evangelical Free Church congregation (Baptists), the Mennonite Brethren Church, a New Apostolic church and the Jehovah's Witnesses. ==Politics== Birkenfeld has been a district seat since 1947 and forms together with 30 other municipalities a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality, called the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld. ===Town council=== The council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 25 May 2014 yielded the following results:Der Landeswahlleiter Rheinland- Pfalz: Kommunalwahl 2014, Stadt- und Gemeinderatswahlen { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"500\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  BfB  BFL  FDP  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2014  9  9  1  2  1  22 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2009  8  8  3  2  1  22 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  8  11  -  2  1  22 seats } BFL is Birkenfelder Freie Liste (‚ÄúBirkenfeld Free List‚Äù). BfB is B√ºrger f√ºr Birkenfeld (‚ÄúCitizens for Birkenfeld‚Äù). ===Mayors=== Birkenfeld's mayor is Peter Nauert (CDU), and his deputies are Alois Kandels (CDU), Dr. J√∂rg Bruch (SPD) and Helmut Lorenz (BFL). Peter Nauert is the first mayor ever to be elected by direct vote by the people of Birkenfeld. Both his predecessors, Manfred Dreier and Erich M√∂rsdorf, headed both the town and the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld at once. Werner K√§ufer was the last professional mayor of the town of Birkenfeld. Indeed, he was acclaimed in the office in 1968 with a great majority for another 12 years, but by 1970, he had to give up his professional office when, under administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants were merged into Verbandsgemeinden. The following have served as mayor of Birkenfeld: * Eugen Ruppenthal from 1923 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1953 * Oswald Morenz from 1953 to 1961 * Werner K√§ufer from 1961 to 1970 * Erich M√∂rsdorf from 1971 to 1990 * Manfred Dreier from 1990 to 2000, (SPD) * Peter Nauert from 2000 until 2014 (CDU) * Miroslaw Kowalski since 2014, (CDU) ===Coat of arms=== The town's arms might be described thus: Azure on a mount vert a birch tree with roots proper surmounted by an inescutcheon chequy gules and argent. The main charge, the birch tree, is canting for the town's name (‚Äúbirch‚Äù is Birke in German). The inescutcheon with the red and silver ‚Äúchequy‚Äù pattern is the coat of arms formerly borne by the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim, thus bearing witness to that time in the town's history. This composition is based on an old court seal from 1577. The arms have been borne since 29 October 1923, when they were approved by the Ministry of the Interior at Oldenburg. ===Town partnerships=== Birkenfeld fosters partnerships with the following places: * Roerdalen, Limburg, Netherlands * Ch√¢teau-Salins, Moselle, France ==Culture and sightseeing== ===Lambdacism in the local dialect=== In bygone days, the local Birkenfeld dialect was marked by the peculiarity of often replacing the sounds /d/ and /t/ ‚Äì and sometimes /r/ as well ‚Äì with /l/, a shift known as lambdacism. For example, a Birkenfelder in those days would have said Fulerlale where Standard High German would have Futterladen (‚Äúfodder shop‚Äù). A full-sentence example can be seen in a remark made by the Birkenfeld sexton ‚ÄúFuchs Karl‚Äù to the church councillor and parish priest Haag: Jo, jo, Herr Kirjerot, pririje kann e jela, awa noch lang net loule!, or in Standard High German, Ja, ja, Herr Kirchenrat, predigen kann ein jeder, aber noch lange nicht l√§uten! (‚ÄúYes, yes, Mr. Church Councillor, preaching is something anyone can do, but bellringing, not for long‚Äù). Lambdacism, though, long ago vanished from the Birkenfeld dialect, having given way to the other shift that is customary in Hunsr√ºckisch: rhotacism. ===Museums=== The Landesmuseum des Vereins f√ºr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld (‚ÄúState Museum of the Association for Local History in the Rural District of Birkenfeld‚Äù) offers an overview of 2,500 years of cultural history. The centrepiece is the interactively equipped Celtic experience exhibit Kelten, Kunst und Kult erleben (‚ÄúExperience Celts, Art and Worship‚Äù). Here, through reconstructions, archaeological finds and replicas, these people's life is presented. Further exhibits deal with regional and territorial history of the Birkenfelder Land. Historical highlights among these exhibits are the High Middle Ages (13th to 15th centuries) and Oldenburg times in the Principality of Birkenfeld beginning in the early 19th century. Regularly changing exhibits deal with both historical and current themes. ===Buildings=== The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland- Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district Castle Birkenfeld‚Äôs gatehouse The Old School on Kirchplatz The former youth hostel; the building was built on the castle grounds on foundations that formerly supported a rectory * Castle Birkenfeld, Burgstra√üe 17, 19, 28, 30, 32 (monumental zone) ‚Äì preserved from the actual mediaeval castle a round tower stump; from the Renaissance complex the gatehouse (no. 17); former Gasthaus zum ledigen Waidsack (inn, no. 28); youth hostel, 1926, architect Wilhelm Heilig, Darmstadt (no. 19) * Evangelical parish church, Am Kirchplatz 4/6 ‚Äì Baroque aisleless church, five-sided quire, 1750-1756, architects Jonas Erikson Sundahl and Johann Seiz; Romanesque Revival west tower, 1895/1896, architect Heinrich Jester, Speyer; bells from 1554, 1717, 1961; d√©cor * Saint James‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Jacobus), Maiwiese 8 ‚Äì Gothic Revival hall church, yellow sandstone, 1888-1890, architect Reinhold Wirtz, Trier; tomb slab 1752; d√©cor * Am Kirchplatz 2 ‚Äì dwelling and commercial house, partly timber-frame, marked 1808, essentially older * Am Kirchplatz 5 ‚Äì Evangelical and Catholic public school; nine-axis Baroque Revival building with mansard roof, 1911; characterizes square‚Äôs appearance * Am Kirchplatz 11 ‚Äì dwelling and (former) commercial house; Renaissance Revival, 1881, characterizes square‚Äôs appearance * Am Rech 2 ‚Äì so-called Backhaus (‚ÄúBakehouse‚Äù); small house, partly timber- frame, partly slated, 18th or early 19th century * An der Oelm√ºhle 4 ‚Äì former mill; quarrystone building, 1580; oilmill beginning in the 1770s, expansion and higher roof 1922; technical equipment * Auf dem R√∂mer 5 ‚Äì building with half-hipped roof, partly timber-frame (with wooden shingles), marked 1723 * Auf dem R√∂mer 6 ‚Äì Baroque house, 18th century, essentially possibly older (1665?); characterizes street's and town's appearance * Auf dem R√∂mer 9 ‚Äì so- called Ku√ülersches Haus; corner house, marked 1590, partly with alterations from the 19th century; characterizes town's appearance * Bahnhofstra√üe 2 ‚Äì Late Historicist house, hewn-stone plastered surfaces, bare timber framing, late 19th century * Bahnhofstra√üe 4 ‚Äì corner house, partly timber-frame (slated), wooden gallery, late 18th or early 19th century; characterizes street's appearance * Br√ºckener Stra√üe 8 ‚Äì house with saddle hipped roof, gabled dormer, 1920s/1930s * Friedrich-August-Stra√üe 15 ‚Äì Maler-Hugo-Zang- Haus; Neoclassical house, 1883 (see below) * Friedrich-August-Stra√üe 17 ‚Äì museum; in the forms of a Roman country house, 1910, architect Julius Groeschel, Munich * Across from Gollenberger Weg 3 ‚Äì cast-iron fountain, late 19th century * Hauptstra√üe 9 ‚Äì so-called Stadthaus (‚ÄúTown House‚Äù); lavish Historicist corner building on a terrace, about 1900 * Before Hauptstra√üe 11 ‚Äì so-called Apothekerbrunnen (‚ÄúApothecary‚Äôs Fountain‚Äù); great cast-iron Gothic Revival complex, last fourth of the 19th century * K√∂nigsgasse 11 ‚Äì dwarf house with barn under one roof, stable built on later and roof made higher * Pfarrgasse 1 ‚Äì Evangelical rectory; solid bungalow, biaxial dormer, 1733 * Between Rennweg 27 and 29 ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial for students from the Gymnasium Betuletia who fell in the First World War; cube upon a pedestal, steel-helmet relief, 1927, design by Wilhelm Heilig, Darmstadt * Across from Rennweg 30 ‚Äì so-called Steinernes Kreuz (‚ÄúStone Cross‚Äù); Bildstock, tuff, 16th century, possibly Pre-Reformation * Saarstra√üe 19 ‚Äì stately Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), latter half of the 19th century * Schadtengasse 2 ‚Äì house with three-part window ensemble, marked 1838 * Schlossallee 3 ‚Äì five-axis wood-shingled house, 19th century; at the south gable parts of a nursery's sunken conservatory * Schlossallee 11 and 13 ‚Äì Neues Schloss; Classicist group around open cour d'honneur, 1819‚Äì1821, architect J.

The house, built in 1883 in the bourgeois Classicist style, is where the painter Hugo Zang (1858‚Äì1946) once lived. In 2006, restoration work began in an effort to bring the house up to a standard worthy of monumental protection. Since 2008, the building has housed not only the Birkenfeld district folk high school but also seven gallery rooms for changing exhibitions of works by local and national artists. ==Economy and infrastructure== ===Economy=== The town's economy is characterized mainly by small and midsize businesses. Owing to Birkenfeld's history as a noble residence town and an administrative seat, no great industrial development ever took place here. The biggest employers, besides the administrative bodies, are thus a foundation and the Bundeswehr. The German Red Cross‚Äôs (DRK) Elisabeth-Stiftung, a medical rehabilitation foundation, with its hospital, Berufsf√∂rderungswerk Birkenfeld (an institute for retraining workers whose condition precludes their return to former occupations), private vocational schools, measures for youth and senior citizens‚Äô home is with more than 600 employees the town's biggest employer. Following the Elisabeth-Stiftung is the Bundeswehr (among other units, the 2nd Luftwaffe Division) with more than 500 military and civilian personnel. The Stefan-Morsch-Stiftung, a foundation for keeping data on potential bone marrow and stem cell donors, has its seat in Birkenfeld. On the lands of the former railway station, a centre for starting up businesses (‚ÄúBIG-Center‚Äù) was built in the 1990s. ===Transport=== ====Road==== Birkenfeld has good road links to Bundesstra√üen 41 (east-west, between Mainz and Saarbr√ºcken) and 269 (between Bernkastel-Kues and Saarlouis), as well as to Autobahn A 62, which is the most important north‚Äìsouth link, running between Trier and Kaiserslautern. Furthermore, Bundesstra√üe 269 links to the Hunsr√ºckh√∂henstra√üe, and thereby to Frankfurt- Hahn Airport, which lies 50 km away by road. This journey is covered five times each day by a bus service. ====Rail==== Birkenfeld's rail link is 5 km away in nearby Neubr√ºcke, which has a station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). Saarbr√ºcken can be reached by train in 45 minutes, and Frankfurt in less than two hours. The former spur line leading to Birkenfeld has been abandoned, and is now a cycle path. ====Hiking trails==== Running outwards from Birkenfeld are five local loop trails for hiking with a total length through the region of more than 60 km. These are the Glockenweg (roughly 16 km), the Eulenweg (roughly 9 km), the Mausweg (roughly 12.5 km), the M√ºhlenweg (roughly 12.5 km) and the Rehweg (roughly 12.5 km). The long- distance Nahe-H√∂henweg and the Sironaweg, which leads by many Celtic-Roman archaeological finds, likewise run by Birkenfeld. ====Cycle paths==== The roughly 120 km-long Nahe-Radweg and the Rheinland-Pfalz-Route run right through the middle of town. They are supplemented by three local cycling circuits, R1, R2 and R3, with a total length of just under 80 km. ===Public institutions=== ====Education==== Since 1996, a vocational school has been established on the grounds of a former US military hospital in the neighbouring municipality of Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach. The Environmental Campus Birkenfeld (Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld) has, as a branch of the Trier University of Applied Sciences, made a significant contribution to the Birkenfeld region's economic development. For school-age children there is a broad array of offerings. * Primary school * Realschule plus * Gymnasium Birkenfeld * F√∂rderschule Schwerpunkt Lernen (special school with focus on learning) Enjoying more than local importance is the Elisabeth-Stiftung medical rehabilitation foundation, with its specific offers of qualifications to people with either physical or mental handicaps. Alumni come from all over Germany and even from neighbouring countries.

Merrie Melodies cartoon planned by Bob Clampett, but was finished and directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 3, 1947, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. Tweetie Pie was the first pairing of Sylvester and Tweety, and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1948, breaking Tom and Jerrys streak of four consecutive wins in the category and winning Warner Bros. their first Academy Award. ==Plot== Sylvester (called Thomas in this animation) captures Tweety, whom he finds outside in the snow, getting warm by a cigar. Thomas' mean unseen owner, Young Emma sees him and saves Tweety from being eaten by Sylvester, whom she promptly reprimands when he tries to eat him again. Tweety is brought inside, and Emma warns Thomas not to bother Tweety. Ignoring this command, Thomas initiates a series of failed attempts to get Tweety from his cage, each ending in a noisy crash bringing Emma of the house to whack Thomas with a broom, calling him names and then finally, throw him out. Thomas tries to get back into the house through the chimney. Tweety puts wood in the fireplace, pours gasoline on it and lights it. The phoom sends Thomas flying right back up the chimney and into a bucket of frozen water. However, Thomas gets back in the house via a window in the basement (or study) and creates a Rube Goldberg-esque trap (virtually identical to one in Charles M Jones' 1945 Porky Pig short Trap Happy Porky) to capture Tweety: After following a trail of birdseed to a whole box of some, Tweety gets into the full box, which is attached to a string that when Tweety gets in, pulls down on the lever of a toaster which launches a piece of toast into the air to knock down a knife which makes the iron it is holding in place fall down a ladder with a trash can at the bottom, and the iron lands on the pedal pressed to open the trash can, which has a string attached to the lid that when the trash can is opened, pulls open a closet, which releases a board to fall on a bellows, which makes a pinwheel spin that is tied to a string that is tied to the switch on a stove that turns on and makes a kettle with the spout plugged by a cork boil, and the heat launches the cork into the air and the cork hits a refrigerator door which has one end of a string tied to a handle and the other end attached to the hand of a cuckoo clock, and when being hit by a cork, the refrigerator door opens, pulling on the hand of the cuckoo clock, which causes the clock to strike the hour, opening the door out of which the cuckoo bird comes, releasing a bowling ball, and of course, the trap backfires and injures Thomas instead. Thomas tries to capture Tweety by running up to the attic and sawing a hole around Tweety's cage, but he ends up causing the entire inner ceiling to collapse (sans Tweety's cage, which is being held in place by a beam). The faux pas creates such a racket that Thomas is sure the owner will come downstairs and wallop him, and so, he takes her broom, breaks it in half, and tosses the pieces into the fire. This proves to be meaningless, as he finds himself being walloped on the head repeatedly with a shovel...by Tweety. ==Production notes== When Tweety's creator, director Bob Clampett, left the Warner Bros. studio in 1945, he was working on a fourth film starring Tweety, whom he would pair with Friz Freleng's Sylvester, who previously appeared with Porky Pig in his (Clampett's) cartoon Kitty Kornered (released in 1946). The working title for the cartoon was Fat Rat and the Stupid Cat in 1946, which would've been the first true cartoon to pair Sylvester and Tweety together. Interestingly, Tweety was depicted living in a bird cage, which could hint his transition from a wild baby bird, to a domestic canary. However, due to Clampett leaving Warner Bros. at the time of the cartoons development, it never entered full-production as his unit was given to Arthur Davis. Friz Freleng later adopted the Tweety project and merged it with a project he was working on‚Äîa follow-up to his second Sylvester cartoon, Peck Up Your Troubles, featuring Sylvester in pursuit of a witty woodpecker. Production of the fourth Tweety cartoon began roughly around the same time A Gruesome Twosome (Tweety‚Äôs last cartoon directed by Clampett) was released, around June 1945, a month after Clampett left the studio. https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/bob- clampetts-a-gruesome-twosome-1945/ When Freleng decided to replace the woodpecker with Tweety, producer Eddie Selzer objected, and Freleng threatened to quit. Selzer allowed Tweety to be used, and the resulting film went on to win Warner Bros.' first Oscar, which Selzer accepted. After Selzer's death in 1970, the Oscar was passed on to Freleng. The cartoon would also go on to become a phenomenal success, and as result, Tweety would always be paired with Sylvester from that point on in subsequent appearances, because the duo carried a high amount of star power.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), pp. 187‚Äì188. Sylvester, however, would appear in many shorts without Tweety, such as the Hippety Hopper series consisting of Hippety Hopper and Sylvester Jr.. Those were directed by Robert McKimson. Sylvester also appeared alongside Speedy Gonzales and both Freleng and McKimson supervised cartoons pairing the two, and would win another Oscar for that pairing in 1955. ==Voice actors== *Mel Blanc as Tweety and Thomas *Bea Benaderet as Tweety and Thomas' Owner ==Availability== Although the cartoon was re-released into the Blue Ribbon program in 1955, the cartoon's original titles are known to exist.

Coesfeld received its city rights in 1197, but was first recorded earlier than that in the biography of St. Ludger, patron and first bishop of the diocese of Munster who was born north of Coesfeld in Billerbeck. The day before he died, Ludger spent the night in Coesfeld and heard mass in the morning in the church he founded. He was on his way from his abbey in Essen to M√ºnster. The road he followed passed Coesfeld and Billerbeck, and after preaching in the St. Lambert's church, 26 March 809, he travelled on to Billerbeck, where he died in the evening. The Coesfeld St. Jacobikirche dates from the same period as the city charter. For centuries, Coesfeld was an important stopping place for pilgrims traveling one of the more popular Germanic Jakobi routes (Way of St. James) leading from Warendorf over M√ºnster (via Billerbeck) to Coesfeld, and then on via Borken to Wesel on the Rhine. ===Bernhard von Galen=== One of the 18 stations of the cross in Coesfeld, erected in Galen's time by his Danish architect Pieter Pictorius. During the Thirty Years War, troops were stationed in Coesfeld. The Prince-bishop of M√ºnster was often at odds with these troops. Bernhard von Galen managed to drive the foreign troops away and even started to build a palace in Coesfeld, but it was never finished and after he died it was torn down. He became known for his sieges of Dutch cities in his efforts for the counter reformation and started a Way of the Cross procession that still exists up to the present day, with 18 stations of the cross. One procession round the historic centre of Coesfeld is still held on Whitmonday but the \\"Great Procession along the stations of the cross\\" held for centuries on Whit Tuesday is now held on 9/14 (Exaltation of the Cross) if it is a Sunday otherwise on the Sunday thereafter.

The Celts called their small settlement, Durum (meaning castle). After the Celts, Germanic tribes settled this area. They were conquered by the Romans under Julius Caesar. Durum became a supply area for the rapidly growing Roman city of Cologne (Roman name Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium). Furthermore, a few important Roman roads skirt Durum (including the road from Cologne to J√ºlich and Tongeren and the road from Cologne to Z√ºlpich and Trier). The Romans remained in the area for about 400 years. The name \\"villa duria\\" occurred the first time in the Frankish Annals in the year 747. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Franks settled in D√ºren. The Frankish king Pippin der Kleine (Pippin the Short) often visited D√ºren in the 8th century and held a few important conventions there. Pippin was the father of the famous emperor Charlemagne. The Franks made of Durum a royal palace, from which the name Palatine (Pfalz in German) is derived. Charlemagne sojourned a few times there. The castle was built at the place where, since 1991, the Saint Anne Church is located. Due to the frequent visits of Charlemagne, a few markets sprang up, such as the corn, cattle, wood, chicken, and butter markets, all of which contributed to D√ºren's development. ===Middle Ages=== D√ºren obtained city rights in the early 13th century. Around 1200, the construction of the city wall was started, which includes 12 towers and 5 gates. The gates faced all directions: in the north, the Philippstor) and the Wirteltor, in the east the K√∂lntor (Cologne gate), in the south the Obertor and in the west the Holztor (wooden gate). There are still ruins of the gates today. The chiseler Leonhard stole a small box with the relic of Saint Anne out of the Mainzer Stiftskirche St. Stephan in 1501 and brought it to D√ºren. Pope Julius II decided on March 18, 1506 that D√ºren could keep the remains. They were kept in the Martinskirche (church of Saint Martin) which was renamed the Annakirche (church of Saint Anne) in 1505. (Probably the church was renamed much later, because in the 19th century it was still called sometimes parish church of the holy Martinus). Saint Anne became the patron saint of D√ºren. Every year, the saint's day of Saint Anne (July 26) is celebrated for one week with the Anna octavos and the Anna parish fair, one of the biggest folk festivals of Germany. ===17th to 19th century=== View of D√ºren in 1945, following the heavy Allied aerial bombing In 1642, D√ºren was embroiled in the Thirty Years' War. Opposing troops destroyed the city. After the war has finally ended in 1648, plague broke out and caused many lives to be lost. A second plague epidemic broke out in 1665. Due to the various attacks on the debilitated city, D√ºren was destroyed again in 1679. In this time, the settlement Miesheim was destroyed, never to be rebuilt. Towards the end of the year 1755 in the area around D√ºren and Aachen began a series of earthquakes, which reached its peak on February 18, 1756 with an earthquake with the strength 8 on the Mercalli scale. The series of earthquakes affected all of Europe, most famously the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The businesses in the area of D√ºren was affected since the 15th century by the drapery and metal industry. Since the beginning of the 17th century, paper industry had settled here, advantaged by the exceptionally soft water of the Rur. R√ºtger von Scheven built the first paper mill in D√ºren. In 1812, there were already 17 paper factories, 11 cloth- and blanket factories, one masticator and two iron foundries. In the year 1794, D√ºren was occupied by French revolutionary troops. From 1798 until 1814, D√ºren was the main city of the same named canton in the arrondissement Aachen of the French Roerdepartements (from the name of the River Rur (Roer) and d√©partment). After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, D√ºren was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia and was subsequently administered within the Rhine Province. ===20th century=== By 1900, D√ºren was among Germany's richest cities (with 42 millionaires and 93 factories) and had a population of 27,168. By comparison, fewer than 5,000 people had lived in D√ºren a century earlier. The city of D√ºren was located on the main fighting front during the Allied invasion of Germany in World War II. During 1944 and 1945, the protracted and bloody Battle for H√ºrtgenwald was fought on D√ºren's district area, and on November 16, 1944, D√ºren was completely destroyed by Allied air bombings. Approximately 22,000 people lived in D√ºren at that time, and 3,000 of them died during the bombing. Those who survived were evacuated to central Germany. Destroyed buildings included the Stadttheater D√ºren (1907), designed in Jugendstil by Carl Moritz. On February 25, 1945, U.S. troops crossed the Rur at D√ºren. After the war was over in the summer that year, many evacuated people came back to the destroyed city and started to rebuild their homes against the advice of the American troops. By June 1945, the population had risen to 3,806. Most of the architecture in D√ºren therefore dates from the 1950s. Eulendom. ==Culture and points of interest== The most famous museum of D√ºren is the Leopold Hoesch Museum. The in 1905 in Baroque Revival architecture erected building presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art. Since 1986, can also be seen artworks of the international Biennale PaperArt. Since 2006, is in the former nurses' home of the St. Augustinus Hospital Lendersdorf the D√ºren Carnival Museum. The most recent museum is the in 2009 founded Stadtmuseum D√ºren. This museum shows an exhibition of the local history. ==Theatre and music== The former Stadttheater D√ºren was opened in January 1907. In the bombing of November 16, 1944 the theatre was almost completely destroyed. Today cultural performances take place mainly at the Haus der Stadt. Since 2004 the multi-functional Arena Kreis D√ºren, which has around 2000 seats, serves as a venue for major concerts. ==Buildings== At the edge of the forest in the Niederau district lies Burgau Castle. The water castle ways inhabited by the Counts of Heinsberg at the beginning of the 14th Century. After it was destroyed in 1944, the restoration process lasted from 1979 to 1998. In Theodor Heuss Park is the Bismarck Memorial, erected in 1892 to commemorate the most famous honorary citizen from D√ºren. The town hall was inaugurated Das alte und neue Rathaus in D√ºren, Festschrift 1959 in 1959. It now ranks as an example of 1950s architecture under Cultural heritage management. ==Worship== *The most important church in the city is the Annakirche. The church was completely destroyed by bombing in 1944 and rebuilt in the 1950s under the guidance of the architect Rudolf Schwarz. Throughout the city there are 15 other Catholic parish and church communities, including in Arnoldsweiler. * The most important Protestant church in D√ºren is the Christuskirche. At its inauguration in 1954, it possessed the highest freestanding bell tower in Germany.Festschrift zur Einweihung der evangelischen Kirche in D√ºren 1954, Selbstverlag des Presbyteriums * Up to the destruction of Kristallnacht, the synagogue was located in Sch√ºtzenstra√üe.

It shows on the top a red castle, below that, a black eagle and in the lower half a black lion with a red tongue. The black eagle refers to the old history of D√ºren as a royal city and Reichsstadt. In 1242‚Äì46 D√ºren was bonded to the dukes of J√ºlich (later, Napoleon was also Duke of J√ºlich). Their emblem was a lion passant, with open mouth and a red tongue. ==Twin cities== D√ºren has 7 twin cities: * Valenciennes, France * Cormeilles, France * Altm√ºnster, Austria * Stryj, Ukraine * Gradacac, Bosnia and Herzegovina * Jinhua, China * Karadeniz Ereƒüli, Turkey ==Media== D√ºren has its own radio station (Radio Rur).

It has also been shown in the UK on Challenge. ==Standard rules== The game is a variation of dodgeball, in which players from each team attempt to hit players from the other team with a ball in order to eliminate them from the round without leaving their half of the court. In the first two seasons, two teams of five compete in a match of three rounds in a best-of-three format. (This was altered significantly for season three, see \\"Other Rule Changes and Amendments\\" below.) A round ends when one of the two teams loses all five of its members. The first round is standard and is played with two dodgeballs. In the second round, often called the \\"Big Ball Round,\\" a third ball which is twice the diameter of the other two is added into play. This ball is often used to deflect attacks. In the third round, \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" the Big Ball is removed and in its place is an orange headband that is placed on one member of each team who is designated the \\"Dead Man Walking.\\" In the first and second seasons, if the Dead Man Walking is eliminated, the team he represents loses the game and consequently the match. ===Elimination=== In each of the three seasons, there were multiple ways for an athlete to be eliminated and sent to the sideline. Some variations in these regulations exist in the three seasons, but for the most part these rules remain the same. The following are ways in which a member of a team can be eliminated: * Getting hit with a ball * Throwing a ball which an opponent catches (in this case, a person previously eliminated can come back in, but the number of people in the playing arena cannot exceed 5) * Dropping a ball being used to deflect a ball thrown by an opposing player * Crossing over the center line or (in seasons one and two) stepping outside the boundary There are also two ways of returning to the game after being eliminated. The first, as previously mentioned, is if a player catches a ball. At this point, one of their teammates can come back onto the court, until five members are on the court. The second way is called a regeneration. In the first season, if all but one member of the team were eliminated, the last player had the opportunity to hit a target aptly named the \\"regeneration target\\" and, if this was accomplished before he was eliminated, all of his teammates returned to the court. In season two, the last player on the court only had to stay alive for 20 seconds, which would regenerate the entire team. In both cases, a team could only regenerate once per round. Lastly, in the third season, this rule was changed again. If the last player standing is able to not be eliminated for 30 seconds, only one of his teammates can return, but if the last player is eliminated, four team members return to the game. However, this could be done an unlimited number of times. ===Other rule changes and amendments=== For the second season, there were two more main changes. Firstly, there was a 5-second delay of game warning. If a team held more than one ball for over 5 seconds, one of its players would be out. The second rule stated that if a player, in the opinion of the referee, was impeding the flow of play of the game by stalling, refusing to throw the ball, or attempting to force a play on the opposing team, the referee(s) could give that player a \\"yellow card\\". Two yellow cards meant that the player in question was ejected. This second rule was introduced in the early stages of the second season and is called the \\"Benedetto Amendment\\" after player David Benedetto, when he deliberately placed two balls immediately on his opponents' side of the court, forcing the opponents - in compliance with the above-stated five-second-rule - to approach the balls, allowing Benedetto to hit them at point blank range, a tactic which was deemed unfair by the show's producers. Although Michael 'Handsome' Constanza originally used the tactics in Episode 1 of Season 1, there was no five-second rule back then, so it was not as abusive. In the third season, many significant changes were made to the rules. First, the teams would add two players each, increasing the number of players from five to seven. Still however, only five members of the team would be allowed on the court at any given time. The players who came on the court rotated; if four of a team's five players were eliminated, and the final player regenerated a teammate, the sixth member came onto the court. The main change in this season was the format of the matches. Instead of 3 rounds which ended when all of the players on one of the teams were eliminated, the matches would be divided to four six- minute quarters. The victor would not be decided by the fastest elimination of an entire team, rather, the team with the most points at the end of the 24 minutes. If a player eliminates any opponent in any way, his team gains one point. A bonus point is awarded for wiping out the entire other team. Other small changes were added. For example, if a player received a yellow card for yelling at the referee, holding a ball for too long, disobeying the instructions given, etc., he would have to stand in a small square while a player on the other team would be given a free shot at him. If the penalized player is hit, the opposing team scores a point, if the player leaves the square's boundaries, two points are awarded. Another small change was in the court itself. In previous seasons, the boundaries had been on the left, right, and front for each team. In this season, however, the left and right boundaries were removed and the court became similar to that of many indoor sports, such as indoor soccer or ice hockey. In the second quarter, the Big Ball is put in play similar to the first two seasons. Since the big ball is used mainly for defending and is difficult to throw, two bonus points would be awarded for a kill through throwing. In the third and fourth quarters, the teams are on the side opposite of that which they started. In the fourth quarter, the orange Dead Man Walking headband comes into play. One person on each team must wear the headband at all times. Any time a Dead Man Walking is eliminated, the other team gains two bonus points, but does not win the game. The headband is simply transferred to someone else. When two minutes remain in this quarter, there is a break in the game where the teams are allowed to switch the players on the court with ones on the bench (but each team retains the same number of players that had been on the floor). At the end of the fourth quarter, the team with the most points is declared the victor and is awarded $5,000. If after the fourth quarter, a tie is reached, the game goes into overtime, in which each team chooses three players to represent them on the court. There are no regenerations, and catching a ball does not bring in a new player‚Äîonce a player is out, they are out for good. The team which can last the longest is declared the winner of the match. In the third season, referees are able to give players red cards, much like in soccer. If a player is given a red card, he is out for the rest of the game. Players get red cards if they behave in a particularly improper manner too serious for a yellow card, such as physical contact with an opponent in a harsh manner. Red cards are uncommon, but have been given multiple times. One player, Brian DeCato, was even suspended for the season due to repeated offenses. ===Tournament format and prize structure=== In season 1, each team played 5 matches; afterwards all 8 competed in the playoffs with 1st facing 8th, 2nd facing 7th, etc. The winners of these playoffs won $10,000. In season 2, each team played 10 matches, and the top 2 teams from each division faced each other in a playoff match for $5,000. Then the 2 winners would face off in the championship match for an additional $20,000 ($25,000 total). In season 3, the winners of each match received $5,000. As in the previous season, each team played 10 matches. The four teams with the best records competed in the semifinals, where the winners received another $5,000. The grand champions added an additional $20,000 to their total. Potentially a team could win up to $75,000. ==Hosts== For all three seasons, the hosts have been Bil Dwyer and Zach Selwyn. ==Sideline Reporters== * Season 1: Jerri Manthey of Survivor * Season 2: Mary Strong of NFL Network * Season 3: Michele Merkin of E! Entertainment Network ==Commissioner== Rip Torn, who played Patches O'Houlihan in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, joined in Season 3 as the commissioner of the league. ==Referees== * Jim Burns (Head referee) * Declan Galvin * Greg James * Chris Pierce * Jim Hazelton :Note: Pierce subbed for Burns in some of the Season Three matches. ==Teams== Each team in Extreme Dodgeball had a gimmick. This could reflect the fact that gimmick teams were featured heavily in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Usually, the members of a team shared a common profession, indicated in their name. In the first season, the teams wore clothing linked to their gimmick, for example the CPA wore sweater-vests and neckties, the Stallion Battalion wore racing silks, etc. In the second and third seasons, all teams wore uniforms similar to those worn in basketball, in team colors. ===Season 1=== * CPA: Certified Public Assassins - Certified Public Accountants; season one champions, and winners of the $10,000 grand prize. They also went undefeated throughout the season. ** Tobias \\"The Sniper\\" McKinney - Creator of the famous \\"Suicide Leap\\", where the thrower jumps over the center line, and hits the victim with the ball before he lands, therefore the kill is valid. ** Michael \\"Handsome\\" Constanza - Went on to be the MVP of the season. Had amazing throwing skills and clocked in with the most accuracy. Had an 82 MPH throwing speed. ** Mandy \\"Sunshine\\" Sommers - Known for catching almost any ball thrown at her. ** Steve Altes ** Gretchen Weiss * Barbell Mafia - bodybuilders; season runners-up, lost to CPA in the final match. ** Tyrone \\"The Rush Factor\\" Rush ** Alan \\"Diesel\\" Grimes ** Jeramy \\"The Mountain\\" Freeman ** Amazon Beard ** Melissa \\"Coates Rack\\" Coates * Armed Response - security guards ** David \\"The Animal\\" Benedetto ** Clay \\"Chainsaw\\" Krueger ** Andrew \\"Barishnikov\\" Brawley ** Michelle \\"Manu\\" Manumaleuna ** Laura \\"Major\\" Farley * Ink, Incorporated - tattoo artists; known to hate the Mimes. ** Ben \\"Psycho/Evil Robot\\" Toth ** Shawn \\"The Hitman\\" Hauser ** Jessica Cabo \\"Wabo\\" ** Damion \\"The Omen\\" Troy ** Rebecca Pontius (sister of Mark Pontius of the Mimes and, later, the Reef Sharks) * Curves of Steel - female bodybuilders, plus a male trainer ** Kel Watrin ** Lillith \\"Fair\\" Fields ** Kimberly \\"The Kimminator\\" Estrada ** Maritza Franco ** Amelie McKendry * Silent But Deadly Mimes - mime artists ** Mark \\"Pretty Boy\\" Pontius ** Lamonte Goode ** Laura Hight ** Stephen Sande ** \\"Angelina\\" Jolie Bailey * Stallion Battalion - jockeys ** Kenny \\"Dirty\\" Sanchez ** Mark \\"M&M;\\" Munoz ** Michael Pipkin ** Christina \\"Shorty\\" Knizner ** Lissette Garcia * Sumo Storm - Sumo wrestlers; lost all six of their matches, including a loss to the CPA in the first playoff round. ** Billy Acquaviva ** \\"Captain\\" Americus Abesamis ** Dante Alighieri ** Jon Beardsley ** Crystal \\"Chainsaw\\" Cartwright *** Katasha Nelson - filled in two games for Cartwright when she was injured. ===Season 2=== In this season, the teams were divided into the Classic Division and the Expansion Division. The former consisted of the Top 4 teams from the previous season, and the latter consisted of entirely new teams. Classic Division * Armed Response; season two champions, winning the $25,000 grand prize. ** David Benedetto, returning ** David \\"Don't Call Me Condoleezza\\" Rice ** Kel Watrin, returning from Curves of Steel. *** Danno Kingman - filled in for Watrin while he was injured. ** Tanya Fenderbosch ** Nicole Zingale * Certified Public Assassins ** Tobias McKinney, returning ** Michael Constanza, returning ** Mandy Sommers, returning ** Art \\"Fly like a\\" Spiegel ** Natasha Pospich * Ink, Incorporated ** Ben Toth, returning ** Kimberly Estrada, returning from Curves of Steel. ** Strati Hovartos ** \\"Scary\\" Kari Richardson ** Shawn Hauser, returning * Barbell Mafia; suffered a long losing streak and were eliminated after the regular season. This was surprising, considering most of their players were the same. ** Tyrone Rush, returning ** Melissa Coates, returning ** Jeremy Freeman, returning ** Vanessa Altman ** Alan Grimes, returning Expansion Division * Delta Force - military troopers; season runners-up, lost to Armed Response in the championship match.

The CDG was founded in 1946 by Graham Balcombe, making it the world's oldest continuing diving club. Graham Balcombe and Jack Sheppard pioneered cave diving in the late 1930s, notably at Wookey Hole in Somerset. Passages through caves are often blocked by a submerged section, or sump. Cavers in many countries have tried to pass these barriers in a variety of ways; using the simple \\"free dive\\" with a lungful of air or by utilising the available diving technology of the day. ==Early history of cave diving in the UK== Cave diving equipment from 1935 in the museum at Wookey Hole Caves Cave diving equipment in the museum at Wookey Hole Caves Two Post Office engineers, (Francis) Graham Balcombe and (John Arthur) \\"Jack\\" Sheppard, who were among the leading climbers and cavers of their era, combined their energies into solving the problem of passing the Swildon's sump. Their pioneering dive on 17 February 1934 used a home-made respirator, designed by Balcombe, that incorporated part of a ladies' bicycle frame. The attempt was unsuccessful but the foundation of cave diving in the U.K. had been laid. In 1935, Balcombe made enquiries with Siebe Gorman, the leading diving engineers of the time. Although they could not help with light weight diving equipment, they did offer training and the loan of standard helmet diving gear. A successful expedition was mounted at Wookey Hole, where the waters from Swildon's Hole resurge. Exploration of the subterranean River Axe proceeded to the seventh chamber, a distance of , which was as far as the divers could physically handle their pipes and ropes. The team returned to Swildon's Hole on 4 October 1936 with Jack Sheppard's newly designed apparatus nicknamed \\"Jimmy\\". It was fed by a football inflation pump that was coupled to a home-made drysuit that incorporated lighting and a telephone. This was used by Sheppard to pass Sump l. Later that year the bicycle respirator became self-contained with the addition of an oxygen cylinder. In turn Balcombe dived solo through Sump 1 and found the air chambers of Sump 2. These pioneers established the pattern of UK cave diving; the systematic exploration of a cave system in its phreatic zone by diving both the resurgence and its tributaries. During the war years Balcombe developed a self-contained closed-circuit oxygen set using mainly medical components. In the Yorkshire Dales he began the great canon of exploration, now known as the Three Counties System with dives at Keld Head, Goyden Pot and Alum Pot. ==Formation of the Cave Diving Group== After World War II surplus oxygen rebreather equipment became available, and the number of divers increased. In 1946 these enthusiasts had a meet in South Wales during which they formed the Cave Diving Group. Wookey Hole once more became the focus of diving activities. In addition to exploration, the early divers found a lot of archaeological material. As the divers penetrated deeper into the cave, the need for penetration below (the safe limit of oxygen diving) became more urgent, and the first attempt with an early aqualung nearly ended in tragedy. Following this incident, the group concentrated on the use of semi-closed circuit rebreathers with oxygen/nitrogen mixtures (nitrox) suitable for the depth. In 1960 the way forward at Wookey Hole was found at a depth of , using 60/40 O2/N2. Rebreathers were also used successfully in South Wales, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. ==Accomplishments== During the 60s, with the abandonment of National Service, there was an increase in caving activity by the post-war population bulge. Readily available commercial scuba equipment was adapted to cave diving. The process was accelerated by the Cave Diving Group's publication of \\"Cave Diving on Air\\" by Mike Boon and the formation of the Independent Cave Diving Group. Divers began to dive deeper and further, and inevitably there were tragedies. Two innovations were introduced in the interest of safety. Separate cylinders, each one with an independent demand valve; and the adoption of the \\"Rule of Thirds\\": one third in, one third out, with one third kept as a safety reserve. In the early days of cave diving in the UK there was always the hope of finding a way into the cave for the benefit of dry cavers. Amongst these must be mentioned Swildon's Hole, Stoke Lane Slocker, Ogof Ffynnon Ddu II and Little Neath River Cave. Progress and development of equipment and techniques have always come in phases, and with this progress, although still hoping to discover dry caves, came diving of a purely exploratory nature. This has led to advances at Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge caves in Somerset. In Derbyshire a great deal of effort has produced significant discoveries in the Peak Cavern/Speedwell Cavern system. In South Wales many kilometres of Daren Cilau were first trodden by cave divers; and the link with Elm Hole and Pwll y Cwm was another major feat. In the north of England, divers have made discoveries such as Boreham Cave, Notts Pot II and the connection between Gaping Gill and Ingleborough Cave and that between Gavel Pot and Pippikin Pot. Keld Head in Kingsdale has been the scene of operations over many years and the dive through from Kingsdale Master Cave represented a world standard. Later the dive was started from King Pot in the same cave system, a different route with a distance of . In Ireland CDG members dived the connection between Noon's Hole and Arch Cave, and between Prod's Pot and Cascades Rising and between Polloughabo and Polbehan. Several expeditions have connected two or more caves together. This tendency to explore water filled caves has been extended abroad to such places as the Bahamas, where there are flooded ocean blue holes. These have been explored by British divers since the early 1980s; several have been connected. CDG members have been active in exploring many sites in Europe and further afield, often using or pioneering the cutting edge of technology. ==Organisation and purpose== The Cave Diving Group operates under a federal structure comprising four regionally based sections located in the major caving districts of Britain: Somerset, Welsh, Derbyshire and Northern, each with its own Secretary, Teasurer and Training Officer. These are governed loosely by a Central Committee which comprises national officers which oversees the running of the Group and liaises with other bodies. The Cave Diving Group has traditionally not actively recruited members ‚Äì a position adopted early on in its history when the availability of training and equipment was scarce. Likewise, owing to early fatalities in the sport, cave divers in the United Kingdom (unlike other areas of the world) have usually been represented by cavers who wished to dive. It is a condition of qualification as a cave diver within the CDG that the candidate is an experienced caver as well as a skilled cave diver. A candidate for membership applies to one of the regional sections, making themselves and their experience known to members. They must be over 18 years old and in good health, never having suffered from epilepsy. Training is provided on a regional basis with national training camps under a loose mentoring system. Final election to qualification is carried out by the candidate's peers - other diving members of the section. The Group also welcomes non-diving members who wish to be associated with its activities; they receive all publications, may attend all meetings but pay a reduced subscription. Of great importance is the Group's role in publishing information about exploration by members (and others) and developments in cave diving techniques. The Group produces a quarterly newsletter and a training manual. Sump Indices are available for each cave diving region (Somerset, Wales, Derbyshire & Northern) of Great Britain which summarise diving activities from Group members and non-members over many years. The newsletter is free to members and on sale to the public as are all the other publications.

The side represents the New Zealand MƒÅori Rugby league. Like its union counterpart, the rugby league team competes in international competitions. With some controversy, the team participated in the 2000 World Cup as Aotearoa MƒÅori. The Super League International Board had agreed to give a place in their World Cup to the New Zealand MƒÅori team as they attempted to gain allies during the Super League war. Despite that World Cup not taking place, the Rugby League International Federation repeated the offer for the 2000 World Cup when it replaced the Super League International Board following the end of the dispute. ==History== Indigenous Dreamtime team before the start of the 2008 World Cup A New Zealand MƒÅori team first toured overseas in 1908 when they visited Australia. This tour was a success, and was followed by another tour to Australia in 1909 and to Great Britain in 1910. Wairangi Koopu takes on the Indigenous line The first game of international rugby league on New Zealand soil was between the MƒÅori and the touring Great Britain Lions of 1910. A separate body, the MƒÅori Rugby League Board of Control, was formed in 1934 to administer the game in MƒÅori communities. This governing body was later renamed the Aotearoa MƒÅori Rugby League and in 1992 it was registered as an incorporated society. The MƒÅori have had a wonderful record of beating international touring teams over the years. In 1983 they visited Britain and a side containing future Kiwis stars like Hugh McGahan, Dean Bell and Clayton Friend proved too strong for the amateur opposition they played. For many years, the MƒÅori have competed in the Pacific Cup alongside other teams with a strong presence of New Zealand-based players‚ÄîSamoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands, so they thought it was right they should have the opportunity to follow these teams to the World Cup. The invitation to the MƒÅori to take part in the 2000 World Cup came about as a result of promises made to them by the defunct Super League International Board at the height of the Super League war that tore the game apart in the southern hemisphere. The MƒÅori team has participated in the Pacific Cup (since 1974), Super League's 1997 Oceania Cup, Papua New Guinea 50th Anniversary (1998), 2000 World Cup, World Sevens Qualification (2003) and Pacific Rim (2004) competitions. The Maori competed against Indigenous Dreamtime team on 26 October 2008 as the curtain raiser to the first match of the 2008 World Cup. The MƒÅori team lost 34-26. In 2010, the Maori team played England at Mt. Smart Stadium in Auckland before the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations in New Zealand. After trailing 18-0 at halftime, the Maori came back to draw the match at 18-all. Maori Haka Meets Indigenous War Cry In October 2013, the side faced the touring Murri Rugby League Team in a two-game series. The Maori side, featuring NRL players Charlie Gubb, Sam Rapira and Bodene Thompson, won the first game 48-18 at Davies Park, Huntly. The second game was played at Puketawhero Park, Rotorua and was won by the Maori side, 32-16. In October 2014, the team will travel to Australia to play against the Queensland Maori team at Owen Park, Southport and the Murri Rugby League Team at BMD Kougari Oval, Wynnum. In 2018 they took part in the NRL Festival of Indigenous Rugby League held in Redfern Sydney against the First Nation Goannas, they were beat 22-16 in a thrilling finish. ==Jerseys== Primary {   } Alternative {   } ==Players== ===2008 squad=== ===2010 Squad=== ===2013 squad=== Team Name Rohe 1\\\\.

First published in serial form from December 1913 to August 1914 in the periodical Die Wei√üen Bl√§tter, The Golem was published in book form in 1915 by Kurt Wolff, Leipzig. The Golem was Meyrink's first novel. It sold over 200,000 copies in 1915. It became his most popular and successful literary work, and is generally described as the most \\"accessible\\" of his full-length novels. It was first translated into English in 1928. == Plot == The novel centers on the life of Athanasius Pernath, a jeweler and art restorer who lives in the ghetto of Prague. But his story is experienced by an anonymous narrator, who, during a visionary dream, assumes Pernath's identity thirty years before. This dream was perhaps induced because he inadvertently swapped his hat with the real (old) Pernath's. While the novel is generally focused on Pernath's own musings and adventures, it also chronicles the lives, the characters, and the interactions of his friends and neighbors. The Golem, though rarely seen, is central to the novel as a representative of the ghetto's own spirit and consciousness, brought to life by the suffering and misery that its inhabitants have endured over the centuries. The story itself has a disjointed and often elliptical feel, as it was originally published in serial form and is intended to convey the mystical associations and interests that the author himself was exploring at the time. The reality of the narrator's experiences is often called into question, as some of them may simply be dreams or hallucinations, and others may be metaphysical or transcendent events that are taking place outside the \\"real\\" world. Similarly, it is revealed over the course of the book that Pernath apparently suffered from a mental breakdown on at least one occasion, but has no memory of any such event; he is also unable to remember his childhood and most of his youth, a fact that may or may not be attributable to his previous breakdown. His mental stability is constantly called into question by his friends and neighbors, and the reader is left to wonder what if anything that has taken place in the narrative actually happened. == Main characters == * Athanasius Pernath: the ostensible protagonist, a jeweler who resides in the ghetto of Prague. * The Golem: while connected with the legend of rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the Golem is cast as a sort of gestalt entity, a physical manifestation of the ghetto's inhabitants' collective psyche, as well as of the ghetto's own \\"self.\\" * Schemajah Hillel: a wise and gentle Jewish neighbor of Pernath, learned in the Torah and Talmud; serves as a protector and instructor for Pernath as the jeweler begins to walk the path of mysticism. * Miriam: Hillel's compassionate and noble daughter. * Aaron Wassertrum: another of Pernath's neighbors, this one a junk dealer and possibly a murderer. He is the antithesis of Hillel, embodying all of the then-popular negative stereotypes surrounding Jews. * Rosina: a 14-year-old red-haired prostitute and neighbor of Pernath, apparently a relation of Wasserturm though no one is ever able to determine what kind; described by Pernath as repulsive, but figures prominently as the object of men's desires and is promiscuous. * Innocence Charousek: a consumptive, poverty-stricken student consumed with hatred for Wasserturm and his son, Dr. Wassory. * Zwakh: a puppeteer; Pernath's friend and landlord. * Amadeus Laponder: Pernath's cellmate in prison. He is a somnambulist who in his sleep assumes the role of various people of the ghetto, allowing Pernath to communicate with the outside world. * Dr. Savioli: a wealthy neighbor of Pernath's who rents a room in the ghetto from Zwakh; there he carries on illicit affairs with married women. === Minor characters === *The Regiment *Dr. Wassory *Angelina ==Reception== In his \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" essay, H. P. Lovecraft said the novel is one of the \\"best examples\\" of Jewish weird fiction. Also, in a letter, he called it, \\"[t]he most magnificent weird thing I've come across in aeons!\\" Dave Langford reviewed The Golem for White Dwarf #80, and stated that \\"It's the sort of nightmare you might have after an evening of too much lobster and Kafka. Very strange.\\" The Guardian writer David Barnett said in his article about the novel that it is \\"one of the most absorbing, atmospheric and mind- boggling slices of fantasy ever committed to print,\\" and \\"[a] century after its first publication, The Golem endures as a piece of modernist fantasy that deserves to take its place alongside Kafka.\\" ==English translations== Since The Golem was first published in German, there have been two translations into English: * Madge Pemberton (1928): First published by Houghton Mifflin Co. and Victor Gollancz Ltd. Published by Mudra in 1972. Published by Dover Publications in 1976. Published by Dedalus Ltd in 1985. Published by Centipede Press in 2012. * Mike Mitchell (1995): First published by Ariadne Press. Published by Dedalus Ltd in 2000. Published by Tartarus Press in 2004. Published by Folio Society in 2010. The Dover Publications edition was edited by E. F. Bleiler, who made some alterations to Pemberton's translation. ==Adaptation for film and theatre== The novel was the basis for the following movie by Piotr Szulkin: *Golem, directed by Piotr Szulkin, made in 1979, released in 1980. The novel was adapted for the theatre by Daniel Flint, and received a world premiere in 2013. However, it was not the basis for three films of the same title by Paul Wegener, which, rather, adapt the original Golem legend: *The first, The Golem, directed by Paul Wegener, filmed in 1914, released in 1915, has been lost; *The second, The Golem and the Dancing Girl, directed by Paul Wegener, filmed in 1917, has been lost; *The third, The Golem: How He Came into the World, directed by Paul Wegener, made in 1920, survives; Nor was it the basis for the operas of Eugen d'Albert (Der Golem (opera)) or Nicolae Bretan (Golem (Bretan opera)). ==References== Sources * Matei Chihaia: Der Golem-Effekt.

Having played for Club Nacional de Football in his home country, he reached stardom playing for S√£o Paulo FC as a centre-back along with Oscar. He is still remembered and revered as one of the best centre-backs in the history of Brazilian football. Legend has it that, whilst returning from a victory in an away match that crowned S√£o Paulo the Brazilian champions, he wouldn't understand what the fuss was all about, but the supporters would not let him sleep. He had won a few times the national championship in Uruguay, so he felt that winning the Brazilian championship was nothing special. He latter realized how difficult it is to win a Brazilian National title. It had been the first time S√£o Paulo F.C. won that championship. ==Career== ===Playing career=== Dar√≠o Pereyra started his career at the Nacional de Montevideo and debuted at the Uruguay national squad when he was only 18, becoming the captain of the national team at 19. After having scored 14 goals in 34 matches for the Nacional, S√£o Paulo F.C. hired him on 17 October 1977 for 5 million cruzeiros, the second largest sum to be ever paid for a player at the time in Brazil.\\"Contus√£o invis√≠vel\\", Placar magazine issue 450, 8 December 1978, Editora Abril, pg. 33 He arrived at the Congonhas airport wearing a S√£o Paulo jersey, and was received warmly by the supporters of that team.\\"Chegou!\\".

Jornal da Tarde, 5 December 1977, Edi√ß√£o de Esportes, pg. 9 Throughout his time at S√£o Paulo, he and Oscar, who was also a centre-back, became a line of defence that is frequently remembered as one of the best in that club's history.Alexandre da Costa, Almanaque do S√£o Paulo Placar.

After the 1988 S√£o Paulo state championship, Pereyra has transferred to Flamengo, where he played only 11 matches. After that, he was hired by Palmeiras in early 1989, when he was already 32. In the following year, he played for two years at Gamba Osaka, then called Matsushita Electronic, where he would end his playing career. Dar√≠o Pereyra also made regular appearances in the Uruguay national team, and has played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.Dar√≠o Pereyra Statistics FIFA.

Under his management, S√£o Paulo shook off a weak campaign in the S√£o Paulo State Championship, but the team only obtained the vice-championship title and a 13th position in the Campeonato Brasileiro. After 1998, Pereyra was replaced by manager Nelsinho Baptista. On 3 October 1998, Pereyra was the fifth manager to take up Coritiba in that very year. However, he managed to lead the team to six victories and five draws in 13 matches. At the end of the 1998 Brazilian championship, he managed Atl√©tico Mineiro, where he eventually obtained the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1999. ===Personal life=== Pereyra is currently employed by football marketing company Traffic in Brazil as a supervisor responsible for discovering talented, young football players.Dar√≠o Pereyra, um ‚Äòespi√£o‚Äô uruguaio nos treinamentos da sele√ß√£o da √Åfrica do Sul.

The VOC was the first company in history to widely issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. A corporate bond is a bond issued by a corporation in order to raise financing for a variety of reasons such as to ongoing operations, M&A;, or to expand business. The term is usually applied to longer-term debt instruments, with maturity of at least one year. Corporate debt instruments with maturity shorter than one year are referred to as commercial paper. == Definition == The term \\"corporate bond\\" is not strictly defined. Sometimes, the term is used to include all bonds except those issued by governments in their own currencies. In this case governments issuing in other currencies (such as the country of Mexico issuing in US dollars) will be included. The term sometimes also encompasses bonds issued by supranational organizations (such as European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). Strictly speaking, however, it only applies to those issued by corporations. The bonds of local authorities (municipal bonds) are not included. == Trading == Corporate bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based, over-the-counter markets. In over-the-counter trading dealers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Corporate bonds are sometimes listed on exchanges (these are called \\"listed\\" bonds) and ECNs. However, the vast majority of trading volume happens over-the-counter. == Market == By far the largest market for corporate bonds is in corporate bonds denominated in US Dollars. The US Dollar corporate bond market is the oldest, largest, and most developed. As the term corporate bond is not well defined, the size of the market varies by source, but it is in the $5 to $6 trillion range. The second largest market is in Euro denominated corporate bonds. Other markets tend to be small by comparison and are usually not well developed, with low trading volumes. Many corporations from other countries issue in either US Dollars or Euros. Foreign corporations issuing bonds in the US Dollar market are called Yankees and their bonds are Yankee bonds. == High Grade vs High Yield == Corporate bonds are divided into two main categories High Grade (also called Investment Grade) and High Yield (also called Non-Investment Grade, Speculative Grade, or Junk Bonds) according to their credit rating. Bonds rated AAA, AA, A, and BBB are High Grade, while bonds rated BB and below are High Yield. This is a significant distinction as High Grade and High Yield bonds are traded by different trading desks and held by different investors. For example, many pension funds and insurance companies are prohibited from holding more than a token amount of High Yield bonds (by internal rules or government regulation). The distinction between High Grade and High Yield is also common to most corporate bond markets. == Bond types == The coupon (i.e. interest payment) is usually taxable for the investor. It is tax deductible for the corporation paying it. For US Dollar corporates, the coupon is almost always semi annual, while Euro denominated corporates pay coupon quarterly. The coupon can be zero. In this case the bond, a zero-coupon bond, is sold at a discount (i.e. a $100 face value bond sold initially for $80). The investor benefits by paying $80, but collecting $100 at maturity. The $20 gain (ignoring time value of money) is in lieu of the regular coupon. However, this is rare for corporate bonds. Some corporate bonds have an embedded call option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt before its maturity date. These are called callable bonds. A less common feature is an embedded put option that allows investors to put the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date. These are called putable bonds. Both of these features are common to the High Yield market. High Grade bonds rarely have embedded options. A straight bond that is neither callable nor putable is called a bullet bond. Other bonds, known as convertible bonds, allow investors to convert the bond into equity. They can also be secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated, and issued out of different parts of the company's capital structure. == Valuation == High Grade corporate bonds usually trade on credit spread. Credit spread is the difference in yield between the corporate bond and a Government bond of similar maturity or duration (e.g. for US Dollar corporates, US Treasury bonds). It is essentially the extra yield an investor earns over a risk free instrument as a compensation for the extra risk: thus, the better the quality of the bond, the smaller the spread between its required return and the yield to maturity (YTM) of the benchmark; see #Risk analysis below. This increased required return is then used to discount the bond's cash flows, using the present value formula for bonds, to obtain the bond's price. See Bond (finance) #Bond valuation for discussion, and for the math, Bond valuation. == Derivatives == The most common derivative on corporate bonds are called credit default swaps (CDS) which are contracts between two parties that provide a synthetic exposure with similar risks to owning the bond. The bond that the CDS is based on is called the Reference Entity and the difference between the credit spread of the bond and the spread of the CDS is called the Bond-CDS basis. == Risk analysis == Compared to government bonds, corporate bonds generally have a higher risk of default. This risk depends on the particular corporation issuing the bond, the current market conditions and governments to which the bond issuer is being compared and the rating of the company. Corporate bond holders are compensated for this risk by receiving a higher yield than government bonds. The difference in yield (called credit spread) reflects the higher probability of default, the expected loss in the event of default, and may also reflect liquidity and risk premia; see Yield spread #Yield spread analysis, Bond credit rating, High- yield debt. === Other risks in corporate bonds === Default Risk has been discussed above but there are also other risks for which corporate bondholders expect to be compensated by credit spread. This is, for example why the Option Adjusted Spread on a Ginnie Mae MBS will usually be higher than zero to the Treasury curve. * Credit Spread Risk: The risk that the credit spread of a bond (extra yield to compensate investors for taking default risk), which is inherent in the fixed coupon, becomes insufficient compensation for default risk that has later deteriorated. As the coupon is fixed the only way the credit spread can readjust to new circumstances is by the market price of the bond falling and the yield rising to such a level that an appropriate credit spread is offered. * Interest Rate Risk: The level of Yields generally in a bond market, as expressed by Government Bond Yields, may change and thus bring about changes in the market value of Fixed-Coupon bonds so that their Yield to Maturity adjusts to newly appropriate levels. * Liquidity Risk: There may not be a continuous secondary market for a bond, thus leaving an investor with difficulty in selling at, or even near to, a fair price. This particular risk could become more severe in developing markets, where a large amount of junk bonds belong, such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. * Supply Risk: Heavy issuance of new bonds similar to the one held may depress their prices. * Inflation Risk: Inflation reduces the real value of future fixed cash flows. An anticipation of inflation, or higher inflation, may depress prices immediately. * Tax Change Risk: Unanticipated changes in taxation may adversely impact the value of a bond to investors and consequently its immediate market value. == Corporate bond indices == Corporate bond indices include the Barclays Corporate Bond Index, S&P; U.S. Issued Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index (SPUSCIG), the Citigroup US Broad Investment Grade Credit Index, the JPMorgan US Liquid Index (JULI), and the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index. == Corporate bond market transparency == Speaking in 2005, SEC Chief Economist Chester S. Spatt offered the following opinion on the transparency of corporate bond markets: Frankly, I find it surprising that there has been so little attention to pre-trade transparency in the design of the U.S. bond markets. While some might argue that this is a consequence of the degree of fragmentation in the bond market, I would point to options markets and European bond markets-which are similarly fragmented, but much more transparent on a pre-trade basis. A combination of mathematical and regulatory initiatives are aimed at addressing pre-trade transparency in the U.S. corporate bond markets. ==Foreign-currency denominated bonds== In February 2015 it was expected that Apple Inc. would issue its corporate bonds in Swiss francs, as the yields of Switzerland's government bonds went negative.Apple said to hire banks for sale of swiss franc bonds S.

Retrieved 20 February 2011\\"The myth of the stiff upper lip\\", BBC The phrase is most commonly heard as part of the idiom \\"keep a stiff upper lip\\", and has traditionally been used to describe an attribute of British people in remaining resolute and unemotional when faced with adversity. A sign of weakness is trembling of the upper lip, hence the saying keep a stiff upper lip. When a person's upper lip begins to tremble, it is one of the first signs that the person is scared or shaken by experiencing deep emotion. ==Examples== Notable examples in British history include Captain Lawrence Oates's understated act of Antarctic sacrifice: aware that his own ill health was compromising his three companions' chances of survival, he calmly left the tent and chose certain death; Sir Francis Drake finishing his game of bowls before embarking on the defeat of the Spanish Armada; Captain Edward Smith as he directed the evacuation of the Titanic and stoically remained with the ship as it sank; and The Earl of Uxbridge's calm assessment of his injuries (he had lost his leg) to the Duke of Wellington when hit by a cannonball during the Battle of Waterloo in the Napoleonic Wars. ==Origins== The ideal of the stiff upper lip is traced back to Ancient Greece ‚Äì to the Spartans, whose cult of discipline and self-sacrifice was a source of inspiration to the English public school system; and to the Stoics. Stoic ideas were adopted by the Romans, particularly the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who wrote, \\"If you are distressed by any external thing, it is not this thing which disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.\\" The concept reached England in the 1590s, and featured in the plays of William Shakespeare; his tragic hero Hamlet says, \\"There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so\\". Poems that feature a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism and a stiff upper lip include Rudyard Kipling's \\"If‚Äî\\" and W. E. Henley's \\"Invictus\\". The phrase became symbolic of the British people, and particularly of those who were students of the English public school system during the Victorian era. Such schools were heavily influenced by stoicism, and aimed to instill a code of discipline and devotion to duty in their pupils through 'character-building' competitive sports (as immortalised in the poem 'Vitai Lampada'), corporal punishments and cold showers.\\"Spartans and Stoics ‚Äì Stiff Upper Lip ‚Äì Icons of England\\" Retrieved 20 February 2011 == See also == == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == *The British Stiff Upper Lip at Sterlingtimes Virtual Scrapbook of British Nostalgia *\\"Decorum is dead!

The shearer is using a sling for back support. Shears and cowbells c.250AD Spain Sheep shearing is the process by which the woollen fleece of a sheep is cut off. The person who removes the sheep's wool is called a shearer. Typically each adult sheep is shorn once each year (a sheep may be said to have been \\"shorn\\" or \\"sheared\\", depending upon dialect). The annual shearing most often occurs in a shearing shed, a facility especially designed to process often hundreds and sometimes more than 3,000 sheep per day. Sheep are shorn in all seasons, depending on the climate, management requirements and the availability of a woolclasser and shearers. Ewes are normally shorn prior to lambing in the warmer months, but consideration is typically made as to the welfare of the lambs by not shearing during cold climate winters. However, in high country regions, pre lamb shearing encourages ewes to seek shelter among the hillsides so that newborn lambs aren't completely exposed to the elements. Shorn sheep tolerate frosts well, but young sheep especially will suffer in cold, wet windy weather (even in cold climate summers). In this event they are shedded for several nights until the weather clears. Some sheep may also be shorn with stud combs commonly known as cover combs which leave more wool on the animal in colder months, giving greater protection. Sheep shearing is also considered a sport with competitions held around the world. It is often done between spring and summer. ==History== ===Bronze age Crete=== Sheep in modern Crete Europe's oldest city, Knossos, derived its wealth from the sheep wool industry. The largest group of Linear B tablets is the great archive principally of shearing records though also of sheep breeding.J. T. Killen, \\"The Wool Industry of Crete in the Late Bronze Age\\". The Annual of the British School at Athens, Vol. 59 (1964), pp. 1‚Äì15 Published by: British School at Athens. The medieval English wool trade was one of the most important factors in the English economy. The main sheep-shearing was an annual midsummer (June) event in medieval England culminating in the sheep-shearing feast. It had always been conventional practice to wash sheep.Preparing Wool for Market. p. 34, col 3,The Scientific American, Vol 1, No 3. published 16 July 1859. :File:Scientific American - Series 2 - Volume 001 - Issue 03.pdf ;Australia's fine wools In Australia, until the 1870s, squatters washed their sheep in nearby creeks prior to shearing. Later some expensive hot water installations were constructed on some of the larger stations for the washing.Gilbert, Lionel, New England Readings, Armidale College of Advanced Education, Armidale, 1977 Australian growers were influenced by the Spanish practice of washing their very fine wool after shearing. There were three main reasons for the custom in Australia: # The English manufacturers demanded that Australian woolgrowers provide their fleeces free from excessive vegetable matter, burrs, soil, etc. so they could be processed in the same way as any other raw wool # The dirty fleeces were hard to shear and demanded that the metal blade shears be sharpened more often. # Wool in Australia was carted by bullock team or horse teams and charged by weight. Washed wool was lighter and did not cost as much to transport. The practice of washing the wool rather than the sheep evolved from the fact that hotter water could be used to wash the wool, than that used to wash the sheep. When the practice of selling wool in the grease occurred in the 1890s, wool washing became obsolete. Australia and New Zealand had to discard the old methods of wool harvesting and evolve more efficient systems to cope with the huge numbers of sheep involved. Shearing was revolutionized by the invention of an Australian sheepgrower, Frederick York Wolseley. His machines made in Birmingham, England, by his business The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company were introduced after 1888, reducing second cuts and shearing time. By 1915 most large sheep station sheds in Australia had installed machines, driven by steam or later by internal combustion engines. Shearing tables were invented in the 1950s and have not proved popular, although some are still used for crutching. In the US, the worldwide shortage of shearers is becoming a consideration for those wanting to expand wool production. With sheep numbers declining in that country the profession sees significantly less interest in becoming a qualified shearer. Importing labour during the Australian off-season has also become problematic because of delays in obtaining work visa and because shearers numbers are limited worldwide. ==Modern shearing in Australia== Shearer on a raised board and rouseabout, Lismore, Victoria Throwing a fleece onto a wool table. Today large flocks of sheep are mustered, inspected and possibly treated for parasites such as lice before shearing can start. then shorn by professional shearing teams working eight-hour days, most often in spring, by machine shearing. These contract-teams consist of shearers, shed hands and a cook (in the more isolated areas). Their working hours and wages are regulated by industry awards. A working day starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four \\"runs\\" of two hours each. \\"Smoko\\" breaks are a half-hour each and a lunch break is taken at midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece-rate per sheep. Shearers who \\"tally\\" more than 200 sheep per day are known as \\"gun shearers\\". Typical mass shearing of sheep today follows a well-defined workflow: * remove the wool * throw the fleece onto the wool table * skirt, roll and class the fleece * place it in the appropriate wool bin * press and store the wool until it is transported. In 1984 Australia became the last country in the world to permit the use of wide combs, due to previous Australian Workers' Union rules. Although they were once rare in sheds, women now take a large part in the shearing industry by working as pressers, wool rollers, rouseabouts, wool classers and shearers.Taylor, Peter, Pastoral Properties of Australia, George Allen & Unwin, Sydney, London, Boston,1984 ===Wool removal=== A sheep is caught by the shearer, from the catching pen, and taken to his \\"stand\\" on the shearing board. It is shorn using a mechanical handpiece (see Shearing devices below). The wool is removed by following an efficient set of movements, devised by Godfrey Bowen in about 1950 (the Bowen Technique) or the Tally-Hi method developed in 1963 and promoted by the Australian Wool Corporation. Sheep struggle less using the Tally-Hi method, reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds in shearing each one. moccasins to protect their feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat. The shearer begins by removing the belly wool, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout, while the sheep is still being shorn. A professional or \\"gun\\" shearer typically removes a fleece, without significantly marking or cutting the sheep, in two to three minutes, depending on the size and condition of the sheep‚Äîless than two minutes in elite- competitive shearing. The shorn sheep is released and removed from the board via a chute in the floor or in a wall, to an exterior counting-out pen. The CSIRO in Australia has developed a non-mechanical method of shearing sheep using an injected protein that creates a natural break in the wool fibres. After fitting a retaining net to enclose the wool, sheep are injected with the protein. When the net is removed after a week, the fleece has separated and is removed by hand. In some breeds a similar process occurs naturally ===Fleece skirting=== Once the entire fleece has been removed from the sheep, the fleece is thrown, clean side down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a rouseabout or rousie). The wool table top consists of slats spaced approximately 12 cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the locks and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the fleece. The fleece is then skirted by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the fleece. The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with fleece wool. Other items removed from the fleece on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and fleece. Following the skirting of the fleece, it is folded, rolled and examined for its quality in a process known as wool classing, which is performed by a registered and qualified wool classer. Based on its type, the fleece is placed into the relevant wool bin ready to be pressed (mechanically compressed) when there is sufficient wool to make a wool bale. ===Rooing=== In some primitive sheep (for example in many Shetlands), there is a natural break in the growth of the wool in spring. By late spring this causes the fleece to begin to peel away from the body, and it may then be plucked by hand without cutting ‚Äì this is known as rooing. Individual sheep may reach this stage at slightly different times. ==Shearing devices== Blade shears Blade shearing demonstration at the New York Sheep & Wool Fair Whatever device is used, shearers must be careful to keep it clean so as to prevent the spread of disease amongst a flock. Blade shearing has recently made a resurgence in Australia and the UK but mostly for sport rather than commercial shearing. Some competitions have attracted almost 30 competitors and there have even been shows created just for blade shearers to compete in.Australian Broadcasting Corp. News accessed 10 March 2017 ===Blade shears=== Blade shears consist of two blades arranged similarly to scissors except that the hinge is at the end farthest from the point (not in the middle). The cutting edges pass each other as the shearer squeezes them together and shear the wool close to the animal's skin. Blade shears are still used today but in a more limited way. Blade shears leave some wool on a sheep and this is more suitable for cold climates such as the Canterbury high country in the South Island of New Zealand where approximately half a million sheep are still shorn with blade shears each year. For those areas where no powered-machinery is available blade shears are the only option. In Australia blades are more commonly used to shear stud rams. ===Machine shears=== Machine shears, known as handpieces, operate in a similar manner to human hair clippers in that a power-driven toothed blade, known as a cutter, is driven back and forth over the surface of a comb and the wool is cut from the animal. The original machine shears were powered by a fixed hand-crank linked to the handpiece by a shaft with only two universal joints, which afforded a very limited range of motion. Later models have more joints to allow easier positioning of the handpiece on the animal. Electric motors on each stand have generally replaced overhead gear for driving the handpieces. The jointed arm is replaced in many instances with a flexible shaft. Smaller motors allowed the production of shears in which the motor is in the handpiece; these are generally not used by professional shearers as the weight of the motor and the heat generated by it becomes bothersome with long use. ==Animal welfare== Animal welfare organizations have raised concerns about the abuse of sheep during shearing, and have advocated against the selling and buying of wool products. Sheep shearers are paid by the number of sheep shorn, not by the hour, and there are no requirements for formal training or accreditation. Because of this it is alleged that speed is prioritised over precision and care of the animal. In 2013, an anonymous shearer reported instances of animal abuse by workers, an allegation to which an Australian Worker's Union representative added that he had witnessed \\"shearers gouge eyes and break sheep jaws.\\"Kath Sullivan,\\"Union concerned about shearers mistreating sheep,\\" ABC Rural, 17 October 2013. Australian Wool Innovation insisted that animal welfare was a priority among shearers. The following year, the RSPCA began a cruelty investigation following the release of video footage that PETA said was taken in more than a dozen shearing sheds in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The Guardian reported that the video showed, \\"sheep being roughly handled, punched in the face and stamped upon. One sheep was beaten with a hammer while another was shown having a deep cut crudely sewn up.\\"Oliver Millman, \\"Sheep cruelty video sparks RSPCA investigation,\\" The Guardian 10 July 2014. The Shearing Contractors Association of Australia \\"applauded\\" the investigation, and Wool Producers Australia president Geoff Fisken said the behavior shown in the video was \\"unacceptable and unsupportable\\" but that \\"we're sure it doesn't portray the 99.9% majority of wool shearers ‚Äì and those shearers would be appalled by it as well\\".Colin Bettles, \\"Shearers back PETA: no excuse for cruelty,\\" FARMONLINE, 11 July 2014. More recent footage and images of Australian workers abusing sheep have been released by anonymous sources, some of which was included in Dominion, a recent Australian documentary on animal farm abuses. No comment has been made about this by the Shearing Contractors Association of Australia. ==Shearing in culture== A culture has evolved out of the practice of sheep shearing, especially in post-colonial Australia and New Zealand. The sheep-shearing feast is the setting for Act IV of Shakespeare's A Winter's Tale. Thomas Tusser provides doggerel verse for the occasion: > Wife make us a dinner, spare flesh neither corne, > Make wafers and cakes, for our sheepe must be shorne, > At sheep shearing neighbors none other thing craue, > but good cheer and welcome, like neighbors to haue\\"Tusser, Five Hundred > Points of Good Husbandry, 1557. ===In Australia=== Shearing the Rams by Tom Roberts, 1890 Shearing the Rams, a painting by Australian painter Tom Roberts is like an icon for the livestock- growing culture or \\"life on the land\\" in Australia. It was parodied in Michael Leunig's Ramming the Shears. The expression that Australia's wealth rode on the sheep's back in parts of the twentieth century no longer has the currency it once had. In 2001, Mandy Francis of Hardy's Bay, Australia, constructed a blackbutt seat for the Street Furniture Project at Walcha, NSW, Australia. This seat was inspired by the combs, cutters, wool tables and grating associated with the craft and industry of shearing.Great Holiday Ideas ‚Äì Relax at Walcha, Vol. 4, May 2009, The Land, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW During Australia's long weekend in June 2010, 111 machine shearers and 78 blade shearers shore 6,000 Merino ewes and 178 rams at the historic 72 stand North Tuppal station. Along with the shearers there were 107 wool handlers and penners-up and more than 10,000 visitors to witness this event in the restored shed. Over this weekend the scene in Tom Robert's Shearing of the Rams was twice re-enacted for the visitors. Many stations across Australia no longer carry sheep due to lower wool prices, drought and other disasters, but their shearing sheds remain, in a wide variety of materials and styles, and have been the subject of books and documentation for heritage authorities. Some farmers are reluctant to remove either the equipment or the sheds, and many unused sheds remain intact. ===Contests=== Sheep shearing and wool handling competitions are held regularly in parts of the world, particularly Ireland, the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. As sheep shearing is an arduous task, speed shearers, for all types of equipment and sheep, are usually very fit and well trained. In Wales a sheep shearing contest is one of the events of the Royal Welsh Show, the country's premier agricultural show held near Builth Wells. The world's largest sheep shearing and wool handling contest, the Golden Shears, is held in the Wairarapa district, New Zealand.Golden Shears 2009 Retrieved on 2009-6-30 The shearing World Championships are hosted by different countries every 2‚Äì3 years and eight countries have hosted the event. The first World Championships were held at the Bath & West showground, England, in 1977, and the first Machine-Shearing winner was Roger Cox from New Zealand. Other countries that have hosted the sheep shearing World Championships have been New Zealand (3 times), England (3 times), Australia (2 times), Wales, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa & Norway. Out of 13 World Championships, New Zealand have won the team Machine contest 10 times, and famous New Zealand sheep-shearer David Fagan has been World Champion a record 5 times. In October, 2008 the event was hosted in Norway. It was the first time ever that the event was hosted by a non-English speaking country. The newly crowned World Machine Shearing champion is Paul Avery from New Zealand. New Zealand also won the team event, and the traditional blade- shears World Champion is Ziewilelle Hans from South Africa. A record 29 countries competed at the 2008 event. The next World Championship will be held in France in July 2019. World Blade Shearing has been dominated by South African and Lesotho shearers, Fine Wool machine shearing dominated by Australian shearers, and New Zealand dominating the Strong Wool machine shearing. ==See also== * Micron (wool) * Station (Australian agriculture) * Station (New Zealand agriculture) * Shrek (sheep) ‚Äì a hermit sheep that became notable in New Zealand for his extraordinarily thick fleece after avoiding being shorn for six years. * Wool classing * Crooked Mick * Wool alien ==References== ==External links== *Golden Shears *World Championship shearing *Walter Bowen *FarmingAds How to Shear A Sheep Sheep shearing information, Training, Competitions, World Shearing Records, World Shearing Championships Category:Australian culture Category:British culture Shearing Category:Australian sheep industry Category:Agriculture in New Zealand Category:Sports originating in Australia Shearing Shearing Shearing Shearing Shearing Shearing ","title":"Sheep shearing"},{"id":"1297139","text":"Panorama Point also known as Constable Mountain, is the highest natural point in Nebraska, at an elevation of above sea level.

Hernani. Alboka players in Zeanuri. The Basque alboka (albogue), is a single-reed woodwind instrument consisting of a single reed, two small diameter melody pipes with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal horn. Additionally, a reed cap of animal horn is placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play. In basque language alboka player have the name albokari. Alboka is usually used to accompany a tambourine singer. Although native to the Basque region, similar instruments can be found around Spain including Madrid (gaita serrana), Asturias (turullu), and Castile and Andalusia (gaita gastorena), but in those cases they only have a single pipe. The name is derived from the Arabic \\"al-b√ªq\\" (ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸàŸÇ), which means \\"the trumpet\\" or \\"the horn\\". Hornpipes are made of a single reed, a small diameter melody pipe with fingerholes, and a bell traditionally made of animal horn. An animal horn reed cap usually encompasses the idioglot reed. These instruments are descended from single-reed idioglot instruments found in Egypt as early as 2700 BCE. During the Old Kingdom in Egypt (2778-2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqarra, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus. Horns were later added to the reed pipe to increase resonance. Horn caps were also added around the reed, and the player would blow into the hornpipe to activate the reed instead of holding it in their mouth. The alboka has two cane pipes, a wood handle, and a horn at each end. It may be descended from the Moroccan double hornpipe, which has two cane pipes, each fitted with a cow horn. The alboka was established in Spain by the end of the 13th-century. Representations of it can be found in the ‚ÄúPoema de Alexandre‚Äù and surviving medieval sculptural church decorations. Notable Alboka players are Ibon Koteron and Alan Griffin. It is also being integrated into modern bands, such as Kalakan. ==Gallery== Image:Alboka.jpgAn alboka on a table.

It corresponds to the English prepositions \\"to\\" and \\"into\\". The lative case belongs to the group of the general local cases together with the locative and separative case. The term derives from the Latin lat-, the participle stem of ferre, \\"to bring\\". The lative case is typical of the Uralic languages and it was one of the Proto-Uralic cases. It still exists in many Uralic languages, e.g., Finnish, Erzya, Moksha, and Meadow Mari. It is also found in the Dido languages, such as Tsez, Bezhta, and Khwarshi, as well as in the South Caucasian languages, such as Laz or Lazuri (see Laz grammar). ==Examples== ===Finnish=== In Finnish, the lative case is largely obsolete. It still occurs in various adverbs: alas \\"down\\", kauas/kauemmas \\"(moving) far away/farther off\\", pois \\"(going) away\\", and rannemmas \\"towards and closer to the shore\\". The lative suffix is usually -s. In modern Finnish, it has been superseded by a more complicated system of locative cases and enclitics, and the original -s has merged with another lative or locative suffix and turned into the modern inessive, elative, illative and translative suffixes. ===Tsez=== In the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the lative also takes up the functions of the dative case in marking the recipient or beneficent of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb \\"show\\" (literally: \\"make see\\") is given below: :{ style=\\"border: 1px solid black;\\" colspan=4 align=\\"center\\"–ö–∏–¥–±ƒÅ —É–∂–∏—Ö—ä–æ—Ä –∫I–µ—ÇI—É –±–∏–∫–≤–∞—Ä—Ö–æ. - kidb-ƒÅu≈æi-qo-rk ºet ºub-ik ∑a-r-xo - girl:OBL- ERGboy-POSS-DAT/LATcat:[III]:ABSIII-see-CAUS-PRES - colspan=4 align=\\"center\\"\\"The girl shows the cat to the boy.\\" } The dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below; there is no such verb for \\"to have\\": :{ style=\\"border: 1px solid black;\\" colspan=4 align=\\"center\\"–ö–∏–¥–±–µ—Ö—ä–æ—Ä –∫I–µ—ÇI—É –∑–æ–≤—Å–∏. - kidbe-qo-rk ºet ºuzow-si - girl:OBL-POSS-DAT/LATcat:ABSbe:PST-PST - colspan=3 align=\\"center\\"\\"The girl had a cat.\\" } The dative/lative case usually occurs, as in the examples above, in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; it should not be regarded as a separate case, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically. They are actually a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details. Verbs of perception or emotion (like \\"see\\", \\"know\\", \\"love\\", \\"want\\") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case, note that in this example the \\"pure\\" dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used. :{ style=\\"border: 1px solid black;\\" colspan=4 align=\\"center\\"–ìI–∞–ª–∏—Ä –ü–∞—ÇI–∏ –π–µ—Ç–∏—Ö. -  ªAli-rPat ºiy-eti-x - Ali-DAT/LATFatima:[II]:ABSII-love-PRES - colspan=3 align=\\"center\\"\\"Ali loves Fatima.\\" } ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Grammatical cases ","title":"Lative case"},{"id":"1297177","text":"The doina () is a Romanian musical tune style, possibly with Middle Eastern roots, customary in Romanian peasant music, as well as in LƒÉutƒÉreascƒÉ. It was also adopted into klezmer music.The Jews of North America Similar tunes are found throughout Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In some parts of the Balkans this kind of music is referred to as or . ==Origins and characteristics== B√©la Bart√≥k discovered the doina in Northern Transylvania in 1912 and he believed it to be uniquely Romanian. After he found similar genres in Ukraine, Albania, Algeria, Middle East and Northern India, he came to the belief that these are part of a family of related genres of Arabo-Persian origin.B√©la Bart√≥k Essays He particularly linked the Romanian doina to the Turkish/Arabic Makam system. Bart√≥k's conclusions were rejected by some Romanian ethnomusicologists, who accused Bart√≥k of anti-Romanian bias. Nevertheless, the similarities between the Romanian doina and various musical forms from the Middle East have been subsequently documented by both non-RomanianThe Romanian Doina and RomanianHora lunga (doina, cantec lung)World Library Of Folk And Primitive Music Vol 17: Romania - Linear Notes by Speran»õa RƒÉdulescu scholars. Until the first half of the 20th century, both lƒÉutari and klezmer musiciansStacy Phillips - Klezmer collection for C instruments were recorded using a taksim as an introduction to a tune. The taksim would be later replaced by the doina, which has been described as being similar, though not totally identical to the taksim. Romanian ethnomusicologist and musician Grigore Le≈üe, after performing with a group of Iranian musicians, noticed that the doinas of Maramure≈ü have \\"great affinities\\" with the Arabo-Persian music.Interview with Grigore Le≈üe The doina is a free-rhythm, highly ornamented (usually melismatic), improvisational tune.Peter van der Merwe - Origins of the Popular Style The improvisation is done on a more or less fixed pattern (usually a descending one), by stretching the notes in a rubato-like manner, according to the performer's mood and imagination. Usually the prolonged notes are the fourth or fifth above the floor note. The peasant doinas are mostly vocal and monophonic and are sung with some vocal peculiarities that vary from place to place: interjections (mƒÉi, hei, dui-dui, iuhu), glottal clucking sounds, choked sobbing effects, etc. Instrumental doinas are played on simple instruments, usually various types of flutes, or even on rudimentary ones, such as a leaf. The peasant doina is a non-ceremonial type of song and is generally sung in solitude, having an important psychological action: to \\"ease one's soul\\" (de st√¢mpƒÉrare in Romanian). Grigore Le≈üe believes that, while scholars describe in great detail the technical aspects of the doina, they fail to understand its psychological aspects. Doinas are lyrical in aspect and their common themes are melancholy, longing (dor), erotic feelings, love for nature, complaints about the bitterness of life or invocations to God to help ease pain, etc. Unlike peasant doinas, lƒÉutar and klezmer doinas are usually accompanied and played on more complex instruments (violin, pan-pipe, cymbalom, accordion, clarinet, tarogato, etc.). Also, unlike peasant doinas, lƒÉutar and klezmer doinas are mostly played as an introduction to another tune, usually a dance. In the regions of Southern Romania, Romani lƒÉutari developed a type of doina called c√¢ntec de ascultare (meaning \\"song for listening\\", sometimes shortened to de ascultare or simply ascultare). The c√¢ntec de ascultare spread to other regions of Romania, with local particularities. ==Etymology== Before being studied by ethnomusicologists, the doina type of song was known by many names varying from region to region throughout Romania and Moldova, doina being one of them. It was Constantin BrƒÉiloiu, director of the National Archive of Folk Music, who proposed that the word doina be used to describe all these songs. The origin of the word doina is unknown. It could be an old Indo-European term, since a similar form (daina) can be found in Latvia and Lithuania with the meaning of \\"folk song\\". Dimitrie Cantemir mentions Doina in his Descriptio Moldaviae among a series of old pre-Christian (Dacian) deities, persistent in popular oral tradition, adding that Doina, Doina is a starting phrase incantation in many folk songs. In the region of Maramure≈ü the word horƒÉ/hore is still the most commonly used; it is a Romanian word which translates into \\"shepherd's lament\\" or \\"shepherd's longing\\", which helps explain why doinas can be very melancholy, but have melodies that are rather poignant and heartfelt. The Maramure≈ü horƒÉ/hore is not related to the word horƒÉ found in southern and eastern Romania, which comes from the Greek choros, meaning \\"(circle) dance\\" and is derived from the Latin oro/orare, meaning \\"to say/saying\\". ==Types of doina== *Hora lungƒÉ - Maramure≈ü. *Ca pe luncƒÉ - found along the Danube. *Oltului - found along the Olt River. *De codru - codru means \\"forest\\". *Haiduce≈üti (c√¢ntece haiduce≈üti, C√¢ntece de haiducie) - \\"haiduc's songs\\" haiduc means \\"outlaw\\" or \\"brigand\\". *Ca din tulnic - unique type in which the melody imitates a type of Alpenhorn called the tulnic. *Ciobanului - shepherd's doina. *De dragoste - popular form, usually about love; dragoste means \\"love\\". *De jale - mellow, mournful doina; jale means \\"grief\\". *De leagƒÉn - a lullaby; leagƒÉn means \\"cradle\\". *De pahar - drinking song; pahar means \\"drinking glass\\". *Foaie verde - classical form; literally \\"green leaf\\". *Klezmer - played by Jewish musicians from Bessarabia and Moldavia. ==Current status== While at the beginning of the 20th century, the doina was the most common type of peasant song (in some areas the only type), today it has almost completely disappeared from peasant life, as most peasant music has. This process has been accentuated during the communist era, with the rise of the new, so-called \\"popular music\\", bringing a new style of performance that diluted the peasant styles. The doina is still, however, common in the repertoire of the lƒÉutari from Ardeal and Banat regions. In 1976 Gheorge Zamfir found popular success in the English-speaking world when the BBC religious television programme The Light of Experience adopted his recording of \\"Doina De Jale\\" as its theme. Popular demand forced Epic Records to release the tune as a single and it climbed to number four in the UK charts. In 2009 the doina has been included in the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. ==References== Category:Romanian music Category:Moldovan music Category:Klezmer Category:Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity ","title":"Doina"},{"id":"1297199","text":"Jan de Hartog (April 22, 1914 ‚Äì September 22, 2002) was a Dutch playwright, novelist and occasional social critic who moved to the United States in the early 1960s and became a Quaker. == Biography == === Early years === Jan de Hartog was born to a Dutch Calvinist Minister and professor of theology, Arnold Hendrik, and his wife, Lucretia de Hartog (who herself was a lecturer in medieval mysticism), in 1914. He was raised in the city of Haarlem, the Netherlands. At around the age of 11, he ran away to become a cabin boy, otherwise referred to as a \\"sea mouse\\" on board a Dutch fishing boat. His father had him brought home, but shortly afterwards, Jan ran off to sea again. The experiences thus gained became material for some of his future novels, as many of his life experiences did.New York Times - Sep 24, 2002 At 16, he briefly attended the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart in Amsterdam, a training college for the Dutch merchant marine but was only there for a year. Per his own account, he was expelled, and told emphatically by his angry schoolmaster, \\"This school is not for pirates!\\"The Quaker Liar . De Hartog was a coal shoveler on the night shifts with the Amsterdam Harbor Police until 1932. As he often had time on his hands, he began to write here. While employed as skipper of a tour boat on the Amsterdam Canals, he wrote several mysteries featuring Inspector Gregor Boyarski of the Amsterdam Harbor Police. At this time he used a pseudonym \\"F.R. Eckmar\\" (which is euphemistically translatable as \\"whatever.\\" The literal meaning of 'verrek maar' is 'drop dead,' and it is commonly used like the English expression 'go and jump in the lake') for these works which (\\"luckily\\", according to the author himself) were never translated into English. His theater career began in the late 1930s at the Amsterdam Municipal Theater, where he acted in and wrote a play. === World War II === De Hartog's career as a writer, as well as his personal life, was decisively influenced by a coincidence that occurred during World War II. In May 1940, just ten days before Nazi Germany invaded and swiftly occupied the hitherto- neutral Netherlands, de Hartog published his book Hollands Glorie (Holland's Glory, translated much later into English as Captain Jan). The novel described the life of the highly skilled sailors on ocean-going tugboats, a specialized field of nautical enterprise in which the Dutch have always taken the lead. Without saying it in so many words, de Hartog portrayed the sailors‚Äîdoing a difficult, dangerous and poorly rewarded job‚Äîas the modern successors to the bold navigators of the Dutch Golden Age. In fact, the book's plot as such had nothing political, anti-German or anti-Nazi, the sailor protagonists' conflict being mainly with nature and with their highly paternalistic and authoritarian (and thoroughly Dutch) employers. Nevertheless, for a country undergoing the shock of invasion and occupation, the book with its outspoken assertion of and pride in Dutch identity became a bestseller in the occupied Netherlands and a focus of popular opposition to the Nazi occupation. As a result, the Gestapo took a lively interest in de Hartog himself, who had joined the non-military Dutch resistance movement, performing/writing plays while assisting in the concealment and relocation of Jewish babies to avoid having them sent to concentration camps. His book was banned. and he was forced into hiding, assuming the identity of an elderly woman in a nursing home. Eventually, he staged a difficult and adventure-filled escape to England.WeberStudies Volume 4.1 - Spring 1987 His book became the best selling novel of the war years in the Netherlands. Jan de Hartog (1943) In London he became deeply involved in the community of the exiled Dutch sailors. The exiles worked with their British allies, often going on dangerous missions, with inadequately armed (or sometimes, completely unarmed) boats. He joined the Netherlands merchant navy as a correspondent in 1943, and later served as a ship's captain for which he received Netherlands' \\"Cross of Merit\\". This experience served as the background to several of his later books such as The Captain and Stella. Stella was made into a movie, starring Sophia Loren, Trevor Howard, and William Holden under the title The Key; it also started de Hartog on the route to becoming a pacifist which later culminated when he joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). === After World War II === De Hartog had many hesitations about authorizing the translation of Hollands Glorie into English, and when finally he did in 1947 the English version (entitled Captain Jan) did not have as much success as the Dutch original. However, in the wake of the war he made the decision to remain in the UK; later he relocated to the USA. He also made the professional decision to write most of his later works in English, beginning with The Lost Sea (1951), which was a fictional account of his experiences working aboard ship as a boy, colloquially called a \\"sea mouse.\\" Precisely because in the war years he had been regarded as close to a national hero, quite a few people in the Netherlands resented this decision to write in English and felt betrayed and abandoned by him. While the sales of his books in the English-speaking world soared, his reputation in his own homeland took somewhat of a plunge, which took years to repair. For his part de Hartog continued to regard himself as‚Äîand take pride in being‚Äîa Dutchman, even after living several decades in America, and many of his later books had Dutch protagonists and themes. Indeed, for many people outside the Netherlands, these books became a major source of information about Dutch society, culture and modern history. In 1952, while visiting New York, he encountered a play he had written while still in hiding during the war, and had sold the rights to while in England. The play was called The Fourposter. A New York Times reviewer called it \\"the most civilized comedy we have had on marriage for years.\\" It went on to win de Hartog a Tony Award at the 6th annual Tony Awards Show for Best Play. Columbia Pictures also made The Fourposter into a partially animated movie, starring Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer. The scenes from the play were linked by cartoon sequences between them. The film was nominated for both, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for its cinematography. Later, in 1966, it became the musical I Do! I Do!. The play also appeared under its original name at the Theatre New Brunswick in 1974. Jan and Marjorie de Hartog took a 90-foot Dutch ship (called The Rival) and transformed it into a houseboat which they made their home. During the severe floods in the Netherlands of 1953, The Rival was transformed into a floating hospital, which de Hartog wrote about in The Little Ark. === Moving to America === In the late 50s the de Hartogs decided to take The Rival to the USA, on the deck of a freighter. They had difficulty locating a dock with cranes large enough to lift the houseboat from the freighter, but eventually made for Houston, Texas. They decided they liked it there, and stayed. While Jan was out lecturing at the University of Houston on playwriting, Marjorie was looking for community volunteer opportunities for both of them to participate in. She decided on Jefferson Davis County Hospital. Conditions there were bad at that time, and with the hospital being significantly underfunded, understaffed, and overcrowded, showed no sign of getting better. Jan decided to document the conditions there, resulting in the non-fiction memoir The Hospital (1964), which exposed the awful conditions of Houston's charity hospitals in the 1960s. The book received a national response, but also a local response in which, within a week of the book's release, nearly four hundred citizens volunteered at the hospital. It led to significant reforms of the city's indigent healthcare system through the creation of the Harris County Hospital District. It also led, however, to considerable hostility and many anonymous threats, which finally forced the de Hartogs to move back to Europe. In 1967 de Hartog wrote The Captain, which revisited his love of the sea, featuring a central character based loosely on himself called Martinus Harinxma, who had first appeared in The Lost Sea (1951). The book was a success, and Martinus would live on as a central character in several sequels. Before starting work on the second in the Martinus series, Jan wrote of the experience of adopting his two daughters, who were Korean War orphans, in The Children, which appeared in 1969. He afterwards wrote a fictionalised account of the origin of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). The Peaceable Kingdom: An American Saga of 1972, was nominated for the Nobel Prize, and was followed eight years later by a Quaker novel, The Lamb's War (1980). In 1985, Jan de Hartog was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College. He published the next book in the Martinus series, The Commodore, in 1986, while living in \\"The Walled Garden\\" in Somerset, England, and it was followed by The Centurion (1989), which explored an interest that he and his wife had become involved in: dowsing. In the novel, Martinus Harinxma dabbled with dowsing and was led on a journey that followed in the footsteps of a Roman centurion. The real story, in terms of researching and writing this book, was not much different from the book itself, with the exception of fictional elements used to carry the story along. In 1993, Jan and Marjorie returned to Houston with minimum publicity, to a much improved atmosphere. Shortly afterward, he returned to the Quaker theme to write the last in the series, The Peculiar People in 1992. This was followed by his last fully completed novel, The Outer Buoy: A Story of the Ultimate Voyage in 1994, which was once again a Martinus Harinxma novel, which expressed quite clearly Jan de Hartog's own fascination with becoming old, a fascination with inner explorations of the mind, and perhaps even a desire to rest. In 1996, Jan de Hartog was chosen to be honored as the annual \\"Special Guest\\" at the Netherlands Film Festival. Six years later in 2002 Jan de Hartog died at the age of 88. Appropriately, his ashes were taken to sea on an ocean- going tugboat, the SMITWIJS SINGAPORE, and scattered on the surface of the sea at position 52.02.5 N ‚Äì 04.05.0 E at 13.10 hrs LT by his wife, Marjorie, and his son, Nick, while other family members spread flowers at the site.Biography of Jan de Hartog in the Daily Shipping Newsletter A few years later, Marjorie de Hartog decided to collate and edit a short story that her husband had been working on some time ago, in the hope of releasing it in his memory. A View of the Ocean was published in 2007, and was the story, in essence, of Jan de Hartog's own mother's death, which reveals his first contact with Quakers. == Media == Jan de Hartog wrote many of his plays, books, and magazine articles in Dutch.

She studied with Mercedes Llopart, who also taught Renata Scotto, Anna Moffo, Fiorenza Cossotto, Ivo Vinco, Alfredo Kraus, and Francisco Kraus. She made her debut in 1964 as Santuzza in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana in Naples. She made her United States debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago during the 1965-66 season as Elena in Boito's Mefistofele; her colleagues in that performance were Renata Tebaldi, Alfredo Kraus and Nicolai Ghiaurov. Other roles that she went on to sing soon afterwards were Luisa Miller, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera and the title role of La Gioconda. A partial list of other operas in which she sang during the first part of her career (1964‚Äì1974) include Verdi's Aida and La forza del destino, Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Puccini's Manon Lescaut, Catalani's Loreley, Bellini's La straniera, Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini, and Susanna in Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina. She gave a recital at Carnegie Hall in 1976 and disappeared from the scene shortly after that. The role for which she is best known is Abigaille in Verdi's opera Nabucco. She made a recording of this role for Decca/London in 1965 (opposite Tito Gobbi, and conducted by Lamberto Gardelli), and gave a performance of the role on opening night of La Scala's 1966-67 season. Within the next couple of years, she also recorded Santuzza (with Mario del Monaco and Gobbi, 1966) and the title role in Norma (with del Monaco, 1967), the latter in an abridged recording that was much maligned when it was initially released. In 1968-69, she recorded Donizetti's Anna Bolena (with Marilyn Horne), a role she had sung at Carnegie Hall to open its 1967-68 season (with Pl√°cido Domingo, Horne, and Dame Janet Baker), and, in 1970, Verdi's Macbeth (opposite Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Luciano Pavarotti, conducted by Gardelli). In 1970, she had changed the spelling of her name from Suliotis to Souliotis. She also recorded arias from Un ballo in maschera, La Gioconda, Luisa Miller, Anna Bolena and Macbeth (the last two before she had recorded the complete operas). She made her London debut on 3 November 1968, when she sang Abigaille in a concert performance of Nabucco at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, an event mounted by the London Opera Society. The cast also included Piero Cappuccilli and Boris Christoff, and the conductor was Mario Gusella. In June 1969, she made her debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, singing Lady Macbeth for the first time. Souliotis was scheduled to make her Metropolitan Opera debut as Lady Macbeth during the 1969-70 season. However, due to a strike, the first few months of the season were canceled. Souliotis never sang at the Met. The received opinion is that Souliotis's early assumption of difficult roles damaged her voice. After an absence from the stage that lasted several years, she began a second career in secondary roles, beginning in 1979. She sang Fata Morgana in Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges in Chicago and Florence, and went on to sing in such operas as Prokofiev's The Gambler and Puccini's Suor Angelica, in the latter as the Zia Principessa. Her recording of this latter role, in 1991, opposite Mirella Freni, was her final studio recording. Toward the end of her career, she sang the role of the Comtesse in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades in several venues, and gave her farewell to the operatic stage in this role in Stuttgart in February 2000. Elena Souliotis died of heart failure in 2004 in Florence, Italy, aged 61. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Greek female singers Category:Greek operatic sopranos Category:Singers from Athens Category:Greek people of Russian descent Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century women opera singers Category:20th-century Greek singers ","title":"Elena Souliotis"},{"id":"1297203","text":"The marbled hatchetfish (Carnegiella strigata) is a small, normally in length, freshwater ray-finned fish native to South America. Hatchet shaped, it presents a gold line extending from its eye to its caudal fin while the area below has a brown and cream colored marble-like pattern (hence its name). ==In the aquarium== The marbled hatchetfish is common in the aquarium industry. Like most Amazonian fish, the species prefers softer, acidic water. As with most characins, they are omnivores. Hatchets have a tendency to be shy fish and are easily intimidated by larger or fast moving fish, so they are only appropriate for very peaceful communities or species tanks. The marbled hatchetfish is usually kept in small schools. It is necessary for tanks inhabited by these fish to have a tight lid, as they can jump out when startled. Marbled hatchetfish are egg scatterers and have been bred in the aquarium hobby. ==Camouflage== Marbled hatchetfish are adapted to life in the Amazonian rivers as they resemble a dead leaf floating sideways on the surface of a body of water. This camouflage protects them against potential predators that may be lurking in the water. Their marble-like pattern is to give the illusion of rays of light breaking the waters surface and reflecting on the portrayed leaf. The fish itself does not move much, letting the waves and currents move it mostly, but with occasional brief twitching movements. This replicates the way a leaf would be blown around or carried away by the tide or a current. The line running from its eye, to its tail, is believed to replicate the midrib (midvein) of a leaf. ==See also== *List of freshwater aquarium fish species == References == * * * Page 46, You & Your Aquarium, Dick Mills, Dorling Kindersley \`\` * Levy Carvalho Gomes, Richard Philip Brinn, Jaydione Luiz Marcon, Lucelle Ara√∫jo Dantas, Franmir Rodrigues Brand√£o, Janessa Sampaio de Abreu, Dawn Michelle McComb, Bernardo Baldisserotto. \\"Using EfinolL During Transportation of Marbled Hatchetfish, Carnegiella strigata (G√ºnther).\\" Aquatic Culture.

He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Boston Red Sox (1950‚Äì54), Baltimore Orioles (1955), Detroit Tigers (1955‚Äì62), and Chicago White Sox (1962‚Äì64). ==Career overview== Maxwell was an agile left fielder who led all American League outfielders in fielding percentage in 1957 (.997) and 1960 (.996). He had only one error in both years. He was also one of the top power hitters in baseball during his peak years with the Detroit Tigers from 1956 to 1960, finishing four times among the league leaders in home runs. Maxwell was elected to the American League All-Star team in 1956 and 1957. He batted and threw left-handed. Maxwell's nicknames included \\"Paw Paw,\\" (given by the Detroit Tigers announcer Van Patrick because of Maxwell's unusually-named hometown of Paw Paw, Michigan), \\"Smokey,\\" \\"Sunday Charlie\\", and \\"the Sabbath Smasher,\\" the latter two given in recognition of his propensity for hitting home runs on Sundays. ==Early years== Born in Lawton, Michigan in 1927, Maxwell played baseball for Western Michigan University in 1945 before being drafted into the U.S. Army. After two years in the military, Maxwell played parts of seven seasons in the minor leagues (1947‚Äì53) before reaching the majors on a full-time basis. Signed by the Boston Red Sox, Maxwell spent three years (1947‚Äì49) playing for the Red Sox minor league team in Roanoke, Virginia. In 1949, Maxwell won the Triple crown in the Class B Piedmont League, with a .345 batting average, 29 home runs, and 112 RBIs. On May 25, 1949, Maxwell capped a comeback from 13‚Äì4 deficit with a two-out, three-run homer in the ninth inning. In 1950, Maxwell hit .320 with 25 home runs for Birmingham in the Double-A Southern Association. After hitting four home runs in the post-season for Birmingham, Maxwell was called up to the big leagues for the last week of the 1950 season. Maxwell went hitless in nine plate appearances for the Red Sox in 1950. In 1951, Maxwell remained with the Red Sox but saw limited playing time as the backup left fielder for Ted Williams. His batting average in 1951 was .188. Things went from bad to worse in 1952, as Maxwell managed only one hit in 15 at-bats. In 1953, Maxwell turned things around, playing the full season for Louisville of the Triple-A American Association, and finishing the year with a .305 batting average, 23 home runs and 107 RBIs. Maxwell's strong performance in Louisville and Williams' broken collarbone resulted in Maxwell being the Red Sox starting left fielder at the start of the 1954 season. In mid-May, Williams returned to the lineup, and Maxwell, to the bench. In the off-season, the Red Sox sold Maxwell to the Baltimore Orioles, but Maxwell had only four at-bats for the Orioles before being sold to the Detroit Tigers on May 9, 1955. ==Peak years with Detroit (1956‚Äì1960)== Maxwell remained with the Tigers from 1955 to 1962, serving as the teams' regular left fielder from 1956 to 1960. After being platooned in Detroit's outfield in 1955, the 1956 season was Maxwell's first as an every-day player, and his performance won him a spot on the 1956 American League All-Star team. Maxwell played 141 games for the Tigers in 1956 and finished among the American League leaders in most batting categories with a .534 slugging percentage (3rd in the AL behind Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams); a .326 batting average (4th in AL); a .414 on-base percentage (4th in the AL); 96 runs (4th in the AL); 28 home runs (5th in the AL); and 87 RBIs (5th in the AL). Maxwell also excelled in the field in 1956, with a .987 fielding percentage. He often gave a pregame show for the fans, especially on Saturdays when the Tigers hosted kids from the \\"Knothole Gang.\\" \\"Shagging fungoes in left field, Maxwell would grin, clown around, and catch the ball behind his back or between his legs.\\" (\\"Charlie Maxwell,\\" by Jim Sargent) Maxwell, circa 1959 At age 30, Maxwell followed up with another strong season in 1957, winning a spot on the American League All-Star team for the second straight year. Having committed only four errors in 1956, Maxwell improved his performance in 1957, committing only one error in over 300 chances. He led all AL outfielders with a .997 fielding percentage. And his 2.36 Range factor in left field was 0.39 points above the average for all outfielders. Maxwell also continued his strong hitting in 1957. Though his batting average dipped by 50 points to .276, he finished with a .377 on-base percentage (8th in the AL), .482 slugging percentage, 24 home runs (7th in the AL). \\"I was a tougher clutch hitter late in the game,\\" Maxwell recalled. \\"Sportswriter Hal Middlesworth told me that I led the team in game-winning hits in 1956 and 1957, even though other guys hit for higher averages.\\" (\\"Charlie Maxwell,\\" by Jim Sargent) After a less than stellar performance in 1958 (13 home runs and 65 RBIs), the Tigers signed Larry Doby to replace Maxwell for the 1959 season. Doby fizzled with the Tigers (.218 in 18 games), however, and was traded on May 13, leaving the left field spot open for Maxwell to reclaim. Maxwell posted career-highs in 1959 with 31 home runs (4th in the AL) and 95 RBIs (5th in the AL). Maxwell hit home runs in four consecutive at-bats during a Sunday afternoon doubleheader in May and hit 12 of his 31 home runs in 1959 on Sundays‚Äîleading fans, writers and broadcasters to refer to him as \\"Sunday Charlie\\" and \\"the Sabbath Smasher.\\" In 1960, Maxwell's batting average dropped to .237, though he still hit 24 home runs and batted in 84 runs. Maxwell's defensive performance remained strong in 1960, as he led all American League outfielders in fielding percentage for the second time in his career. He committed only one error in over 1,000 innings in left field, for a .996 fielding percentage. ==Later years (1961‚Äì1964)== In 1961, slugger Rocky Colavito took over Maxwell's spot in left field. Colavito hit 45 home runs and 140 RBIs, and Maxwell was relegated principally to a pinch hitting role. After batting .194 in 30 games in 1962, the Tigers traded Maxwell to the Chicago White Sox on June 25, 1962. Maxwell had a late season revival with the White Sox in 1962. By the third week of August, Maxwell was batting .352 for Chicago, and had a 13-game hitting streak, the team's longest that year. Maxwell wound up hitting .296 for the White Sox in 1962 with nine home runs. Maxwell also continued his \\"Sunday Charlie\\" tendencies with the White Sox, hitting five of his nine home runs in 1962 on Sundays, including 3 home runs during a Sunday doubleheader in July. Maxwell's batting average dropped to .231 in 1963, and he managed only three home runs. The White Sox released Maxwell in April 1964 after Maxwell went hitless in two pinch-hitting appearances. In a 14-season career, Maxwell was a .264 hitter with 148 home runs and 532 RBIs in 1,133 games. Excellent defensively, Maxwell posted a .988 fielding percentage playing at first base and left and right field. ==Life after baseball== After his baseball career ended, Maxwell returned to his home in Paw Paw, Michigan, where he sold automobile parts. In 1997, Maxwell was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Charlie Maxwell Days were celebrated in August 2010 in Paw Paw with the renaming of the Paw Paw field to the \\"Charlie Maxwell Ball Diamond\\"., Paw Paw Chamber of Commerce. ==References== ==External links== * Baseball Library * * Official Web Site for Bound Stems Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:American League All-Stars Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Baseball players from Michigan Category:Western Michigan University alumni Category:People from Van Buren County, Michigan Category:Roanoke Red Sox players Category:Scranton Red Sox players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:People from Longboat Key, Florida Category:People from Paw Paw, Michigan ","title":"Charlie Maxwell"},{"id":"1297258","text":"Otar Vasilisdze Taktakishvili (; ; 27 July 1924 ‚Äì 21 February 1989) was a prominent Georgian composer, teacher, conductor, and musicologist of the Soviet period. Although in the West Taktakishvili is perhaps best known for his 1968 Sonata for Flute and Piano, his works include two symphonies, four piano concertos, two violin concertos, two cello concertos, and operas (Mindia, First Love, The Abduction of the Moon, Mususi, Three Tales). He also wrote several symphonic poems and oratorios, as well as adaptations of Georgian folk songs and a multitude of compositions for instruments and voice. While still a student at the Tbilisi State Conservatory, Taktakishvili composed the Anthem of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1949 he became a Professor of the Conservatory, as well as the conductor and artistic director of the Georgian State Chorus. In 1951, he received his first Stalin Prize (USSR State Prize) for his First Symphony. In 1962, Taktakishvili became Chairman of the Georgian Composers' Union; and in 1965, the Minister for Culture of the Georgian Republic, until 1983. He was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1974, the Lenin Prize in 1982, and the USSR State Prize in 1951, 1952 and 1967. Throughout his career, he also served as a member of the international musical committee of UNESCO, and twice headed the electoral committee for the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. ==Biography== Otar V. Taktakishvili was born and grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia, in a musical family. He was raised by a single mother, noblewoman Elisabed Mikhailis asuli Taktakishvili, who worked as an artist at the Georgian Opera House. As a result of his mother's background Otar had a childhood rich in music. He was also strongly influenced by his uncle Shalva Taktakishvili, who was a composer and a professor at the Tbilisi Conservatory. Shalva was one of the founders of the ‚ÄúAssociation of Young Georgian String Orchestra\\", and had authored operas, ballets and chamber works. Otar's other uncle, Giorgi Taktakishvili was a cellist and director of a music school. His uncles were young Otar's first musical guides and influences. From a young age, the composer showed great musical promise, and as a child was able to correctly guess notes played on the piano while blindfolded. Otar's mother Elizabeth and his aunt in the c. early 1900s While attending the No42 School on Barnov St. in Tbilisi, Otar started his piano lessons with Tamara V. Bagrationi. He subsequently studied with several piano educators including Militsa K. Korius, Anastasia D. Virasladze, and Evgenia Vasilievna Cherniavskaia, where he met his future wife, Irina Giorgienvna Chirakadze, with whom he lived until the end of his life in 1989. Their romance started at the piano while practicing a piano piece for four hands. At the end of high school, he attended and received a diploma from the Air Force Technicuum until he began his studies at the Tbilisi conservatory. Soon after entering the conservatory in 1942, while Georgia was at war with Nazi Germany, Taktakishvili composed the Anthem of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. According to the composer's own report, his mother had urged him to enter the contest for the National Anthem after seeing the words to the anthem published in the newspaper. The 19-year-old composer wrote the music ‚Äúin one try‚Äù, submitted his entry and forgot about the contest. He only found out that his music had been selected when he stood outside the concert hall and heard his anthem being played. Taktakishvili studied at the Tbilisi Conservatory under Aleksandr Gauk, Sergei V. Barchudarian and Andria Balanchivadze. The composer's early influences were Georgian folk music, composers of the classical era, e.g. Mozart, J.S. Bach and Beethoven, and more modern composers, including Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. In his senior year, Taktakishvili had the opportunity to study with Dmitri Shostakovich, and that led to a long-standing collaboration and friendship. Taktakishvili was survived by his spouse, Irina Chirakadze, who resided in the same apartment on 6 Taktakishvili street (former Riga street) where the composer lived from 1964 until 1989, as well as his son Mikhail O. Taktakishvili, who was a professor of Chemistry, and grandson Otar M. Taktakishvili, who is a physician and a composer, living in New York. == Works == === Operas === * Mindia (based on works of Vazha- Pshavela, 1961) * Award (Tele-opera, 1964) * Three Tales, operatic triptychon from three short operas. * The Abduction of the Moon (Based on the novel of Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, 1977) * Mususi (The Lady Killer), comic opera (Based on the novel of Mikheil Javakhishvili, 1977) * First Love (1979) === Filmography === * 1957 ‚Äî I Will Say the Truth * 1982 ‚Äî The Law of Eternity * 1984 ‚Äî Monday - Usual Day == Awards == * People's Artist of Georgia (1961) * People's Artist of the USSR (1974) * USSR State Prize —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å–µ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ (1951) for first symphony * USSR State Prize –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ (1952) * USSR State Prize (1967) * Lenin Prize (1982) ‚Äî For opera: \\"The Abduction of the Moon\\" (1977) * Shota Rustaveli Prize (1984) * Order of Lenin (1966) * Order of the October Revolution (1971) * Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1958) * Medals * Albert Schweitzer Prize (1986) * Honoured citizen of Tbilisi (1985). == References == == Sources == * Finscher, Ludwig (ed.): Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 2nd ed.

It is a colorless to light yellow liquid. Ethyl oleate is produced by the body during ethanol intoxication. Ethyl oleate is used as a solvent for pharmaceutical drug preparations involving lipophilic substances such as steroids. It also finds use as a lubricant and a plasticizer. Louis Bouveault used ethyl oleate to demonstrate Bouveault‚ÄìBlanc reduction, producing oleyl alcohol and ethanol, a method which was subsequently refined and published in Organic Syntheses. Ethyl oleate is regulated as a food additive by the Food and Drug Administration under \\"Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption\\", 21CFR172.515. Ethyl oleate has been identified as a primer pheromone in honeybees. Ethyl oleate is one of the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) that is formed in the body after ingestion of ethanol. There is a growing body of research literature that implicates FAEEs such as ethyl oleate as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain). Among the speculations is that ethyl oleate may be the toxic mediator of alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome. The oral ingestion of ethyl oleate has been carefully studied and due to rapid degradation in the digestive tract it appears safe for oral ingestion. Ethyl oleate is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any injectable use. However, it is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of progesterone in support of pregnancy. Studies which document the safe use of ethyl oleate in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus have never been performed. ==See also== *Oleate *In ethenolysis, methyl oleate, the methyl ester of oleic acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate: : CH2=CH2 ‚Üí CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 \\\\+ MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2 == References == Category:Ethyl esters Category:Food additives Category:Insect pheromones ","title":"Ethyl oleate"},{"id":"1297277","text":"R√≥zsa P√©ter R√≥zsa P√©ter, born R√≥zsa Politzer, (17 February 1905 - 16 February 1977) was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She is best known as the \\"founding mother of recursion theory\\". ==Early life and education== P√©ter was born in Budapest, Hungary, as R√≥zsa Politzer (Hungarian: Politzer R√≥zsa). She attended P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University (now E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University), originally studying chemistry but later switching to mathematics. She attended lectures by Lip√≥t Fej√©r and J√≥zsef K√ºrsch√°k. While at university, she met L√°szl√≥ Kalm√°r; they would collaborate in future years and Kalm√°r encouraged her to pursue her love of mathematics. After graduating in 1927, P√©ter could not find a permanent teaching position although she had passed her exams to qualify as a mathematics teacher. Due to the effects of the Great Depression, many university graduates could not find work and P√©ter began private tutoring. At this time, she also began her graduate studies. ==Professional career and research== Initially, P√©ter began her graduate research on number theory. Upon discovering that her results had already been proven by the work of Robert Carmichael and L. E. Dickson, she abandoned mathematics to focus on poetry. However, she was convinced to return to mathematics by her friend L√°szl√≥ Kalm√°r, who suggested she research the work of Kurt G√∂del on the theory of incompleteness. She prepared her own, different proofs to G√∂del's work. P√©ter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, \\"Rekursive Funktionen,\\" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich, Switzerland in 1932. For her research, she received her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled \\"√úber rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe\\" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research. In 1937, she was appointed as contributing editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. After the passage of the Jewish Laws of 1939 in Hungary, P√©ter was forbidden to teach because of her Jewish origin and was briefly confined to a ghetto in Budapest. During World War II, she wrote her book Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions, a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic. Originally published in Hungarian, it has been translated into English and at least a dozen other languages. With the end of the war in 1945, P√©ter received her first full-time teaching appointment at the Budapest Teachers‚Äô Training College. In 1952, she was the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics. After the College closed in 1955, she taught at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University until her retirement in 1975. She was a popular professor, known as \\"Aunt R√≥zsa\\" to her students. In 1951, she published her key work, Recursive Functions (Rekursive Funtionen). She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959 she presented a major paper \\"√úber die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen f√ºr abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche\\" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962). Beginning in the mid-1950s, P√©ter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was Recursive Functions in Computer Theory. Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the theory of computers. It was translated into English in 1981. ==Honors== P√©ter was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1951. She received the Man√≥ Beke Prize by the J√°nos Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1953, the Silver State Prize in 1970, and the Gold State Prize in 1973. In 1973, she became the first woman to be elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. ==See also== * Ackermann function * Recursive function theory * List of pioneers in computer science ==References== Category:Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Category:Hungarian Jews Category:20th-century Hungarian mathematicians Category:1905 births Category:1977 deaths Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Austro- Hungarian mathematicians Category:E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University alumni Category:E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University faculty Category:Computability theorists Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:Mathematicians from Budapest Category:Mathematical logicians Category:20th-century women mathematicians ","title":"R√≥zsa P√©ter"},{"id":"1297288","text":"The Wendelstedt Umpire School umpires for professional baseball is the only independently run professional umpire training program recognized by the minor leagues and major leagues. It is located in Ormond Beach, Florida. It runs for five weeks each early January through early February. The school is open to both males and females; the only female ever to work a Major League Baseball (MLB) spring training game, Pam Postema, graduated from the school, as have a number of other female professional umpires. The school was previously known as the Bill McGowan School for Umpires and the Al Somers Umpire School. ==History== Umpire Bill McGowan founded the program as the Bill McGowan School for Umpires in 1938. The school was run by former umpire Al Somers after McGowan's death in the 1950s. Harry Wendelstedt was the chief instructor for the Somers school, acquiring the school in 1977, where it has stayed in family ownership, with son Hunter Wendelstedt in control since 2012. == Facilities == The Wendelstedt Umpire School leases the Harry Wendelstedt Jr. baseball fields at the Ormond Beach Sports Complex. The school's lease is good through 2027 after being renewed for a decade in 2017. Students stay in a hotel offsite, and must commute to the classroom and fields for coursework. == Curriculum == While the Wendelstedt Umpire School is in session, students work six days a week, Monday through Saturday, usually starting at 9am. Students train in a classroom and on the fields. Training on most days begins in a classroom, where students learn from two instructors, one reading from the Official Baseball Rules while the other interprets the rules. Students take 25 tests, and to qualify for advancement, must score a 70% or better. All tests are mostly multiple choice and true/false, and are all based on the teachings of the rules. Following training in the classroom, students walk to the fields. Students learn from instructors on how to apply the rules on the baseball diamond. They also learn proper umpire mechanics. Students work in batting cages, where they learn how to track pitches and effectively call balls and strikes.

The Land Cruiser debuted at the World's Fair alongside the Silver Arrow, a product of Studebaker's former premium make Pierce-Arrow. It was also manufactured in Vernon, California. The Land Cruiser was introduced at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair as an extensively streamlined sedan. Many of the same aerodynamic features of the car were shared with Pierce-Arrow's Silver Arrow show car that also debuted at the fair. Work on both automobiles was authorized prior to the company being placed in receivership in March 1933, and Pierce being sold to investors. { 1934 Land Cruiser } Production Land Cruisers began to appear in dealer showrooms in the fall of 1933 as 1934 models. The Land Cruiser was designated as a body style, and classified in the President model range (C Series) for the year. It retailed for $1,510. The body style was shared with the President and Commander series for 1936. From 1937-1940, the car was classified as the Commander Cruiser and President Cruiser. The Land Cruiser name officially returned in 1941 and 1942. In addition to offering its Land Cruisers in the Commander and President lines, for 1941 Studebaker introduced the ultra-luxurious Skyway Land Cruiser which featured a slightly curved single-pane windshield, rear fender skirts and premium details and fabrics. The 1947 Studebaker models were so revolutionary that it had other car builders scurrying back to their drawing boards. While other manufacturers settled for re-chroming their pre-war models, the 1947 Studebaker, touted as \\"First by Far with a Postwar Car\\", had a completely new body. The new Land Cruiser exclusively rode the company's longest wheelbase (), which provided additional legroom for rear seat passengers. It featured center-opening rear doors (called \\"suicide doors\\" by some) and was powered by the larger of Studebaker's two straight-6 engines. The Land Cruiser suggested price of $2043 included a one-piece curved windshield, an electric clock and carpeting front and rear. Only minor trim changes for 1948 brought a Land Cruiser price of $2265, and in 1949 it was increased to $2328. { 1947 Land Cruiser 1947 Land Cruiser } Since it was a seller‚Äôs market after WWII, Studebaker felt no need to change the basic design of the car, even though they knew that other makers would have ‚Äúnew‚Äù cars in 1949. Studebaker coasted along with the old bodies until 1952. But 1950 saw the ‚ÄúNext Look in Cars\\" ‚Äî Studebaker‚Äôs answer to the other manufacturer's 1949 models. Considered very radical for the era, it had three-point front styling, popularly known as the ‚Äúbullet-nose‚Äù. Over 10,000 more Land Cruisers were sold in 1950 than in 1949. Studebaker Automatic Drive was introduced mid-year and was arguably the most advanced automatic transmission of the day. It featured reverse gear lock-out, hill-holder, anti-creep and a locking torque converter which allowed direct drive with virtually no converter power loss in high gear. The price of the 1950 Land Cruiser went down to $2187. Sales in 1951 skyrocketed, an increase of almost 12,000 over 1950. This can probably be attributed to the introduction of the lively new Studebaker V8 engine that year. The front styling stayed virtually the same, with a minor redesign of the three points. Once again, the Land Cruiser had its own wheelbase, at 119\\"; the Commander now shared the 115\\" wheelbase of the Champion models. The price was raised to $2289. The 1952 Land Cruiser was the last to use real glass for the tail and parking light lenses. Its grille, designated by some as the \\"clam digger\\", was actually a preview of the next generation. The 1953 Land Cruisers were complete departure from the ‚Äô47-‚Äô52 models. The 1953 model sold retail for $2316. They were built on the same frame as the new Starliner and Starlight coupe models but, as with many new models, there were some initial problems, primarily with the fit of the front fenders. With the engine out of the car, they fit. With the engine in the car, they didn‚Äôt. This was found to be primarily the fault of using a thinner gauge steel for the frame. The theory was that if the frame could flex a little, the car would ride better. The problem was, it flexed too much. If you jacked up one corner of the car, to change a tire, for example, the frame flexed so much that you could either not open the door or could not close it. There were also fewer frame re- enforcements than in subsequent years. As you might imagine, this problem caused many a late night conference and hasty fixes and tended to give the new model a bad name almost immediately. Then a problem with the new (and revolutionary, for its day) mechanical power steering raised its head. It only required of pressure to turn the steering wheel but it was noisy. Only 100 of these units were sold before Studebaker began using GM Saginaw type units. The Studebaker company had a problem with the Mercedes-Benz company. A few years in the future, Studebaker would be the American distributor for that brand, but in 1953, the M-B tri-star emblem was turned upside down and put on the front and rear of Studebaker cars, minus the encircling ring. (Mercedes-Benz cars were still relatively unknown in America at that time, so most people probably would never have drawn any connection between the two brands.) In the upper part, the Commander had a gold ‚Äú8‚Äù while the Champion a gold ‚ÄúS‚Äù. The upside-down tri-star was used elsewhere in the car. The wheel covers, back-up light lenses, radio delete plate, horn button and the rear ashtray on the Starliner/Starlight coupe‚Äîall had this emblem. M-B complained and Studebaker hastily re-designed the emblems. On the hood and trunk, they removed the M-B look-alike and on the Commander, replaced it with a large gold ‚Äú8‚Äù in the middle of a chrome ‚ÄúV‚Äù (basically they removed one of the three arms of the \\"star\\", changing it into a \\"v\\".) On the Champion, a gold ‚ÄúS‚Äù replaced the ‚Äú8‚Äù. When the other items ran their course, they were replaced by non-tri-star items. These are now collectors items. The construction problems were corrected in the 1954 Land Cruiser models with heavier metal in the frames and an additional re-enforcing crossmember. The famous designer, Eleanor LeMaire was retained to brighten up the interiors of the new cars. She demanded 4 more colorful interiors than previously, getting away from the one drab gray pin stripe color of the previous year. These new colors included green, blue and tan as well as an opulent silver-gray. The front grille bars had 5 small vertical fins each to differentiate them from the earlier model. New, larger brakes were included in the package, shortening stopping distances by according to Motor Trend. Engine horsepower increased to 127 as the result of a 0.5 compression increase (to 7.5). There was also a smoother looking instrument panel, doing away with the individually hooded gauges of the previous year. The 1954 Land Cruiser sold for $2438. All in all, many people are of the opinion that the 1954 Land Cruiser was better designed than the 1955 Ultra-Vista wrap around windshield President models. While it was in keeping with most other brands of the era, the large amount of chrome (demanded by the sales department) caused many people to shy away from the ‚Äô55 Studebakers. In 1955, the name was changed. Top-trimmed Studebakers from 1955-1958 went by the Studebaker President name (revived from the prewar President models). For 1956, an upscale President Classic sedan was offered. The President Classic used the longer 120.5\\" wheelbase of the Hawks, and like the 1947-1950 Land Cruisers used the additional length to create a roomier rear passenger area. The President Classic was continued for 1957-1958, though no longer carrying the \\"Classic\\" model name. After a four-year run, The President models, in turn, were dropped at the end of 1958 to make way for the new compact Lark model. A longer wheelbase version of the Lark sedan was offered for fleet sales. Dubbed the Economiler, it was marketed for use as a taxicab, again featuring a roomier back seat area than the regular Larks. In 1961, Studebaker added a Lark model, the Cruiser, which continued through the 1966 model year. This model was built on the longer wheelbase chassis and was a better equipped and more luxurious version of the 4-door Lark.

It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. See No free lunch in search and optimization for treatment of the research area. While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.Whitley, Darrell, and Jean Paul Watson. \\"Complexity theory and the no free lunch theorem.\\" In Search Methodologies, pp. 317‚Äì339. Springer, Boston, MA, 2005.Giraud-Carrier, Christophe, and Foster Provost. \\"Toward a justification of meta-learning: Is the no free lunch theorem a show-stopper.\\" In Proceedings of the ICML-2005 Workshop on Meta-learning, pp. 12‚Äì19. 2005. ==Example== Posit a toy universe that exists for exactly two days and on each day contains exactly one object, a square or a triangle. The universe has exactly four possible histories: # (square, triangle): the universe contains a square on day 1, and a triangle on day 2 # (square, square) # (triangle, triangle) # (triangle, square) Any prediction strategy that succeeds for history #2, by predicting a square on day 2 if there is a square on day 1, will fail on history #1, and vice versa. If all histories are equally likely, then any prediction strategy will score the same, with the same accuracy rate of 0.5. ==Original NFL theorems== Wolpert and Macready give two NFL theorems that are closely related to the folkloric theorem. In their paper, they state: The first theorem hypothesizes objective functions that do not change while optimization is in progress, and the second hypothesizes objective functions that may change. where d_m^y denotes the ordered set of size m of the cost values y associated to input values x \\\\in X, f:X \\\\rightarrow Y is the function being optimized and P(d_m^y \\\\mid f, m, a) is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm a run m times on function f. The theorem can be equivalently formulated as follows: Here, blind search means that at each step of the algorithm, the element v \\\\in V is chosen at random with uniform probability distribution from the elements of V that have not been chosen previously. In essence, this says that when all functions f are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of m values in the course of optimization does not depend upon the algorithm. In the analytic framework of Wolpert and Macready, performance is a function of the sequence of observed values (and not e.g. of wall-clock time), so it follows easily that all algorithms have identically distributed performance when objective functions are drawn uniformly at random, and also that all algorithms have identical mean performance. But identical mean performance of all algorithms does not imply Theorem 1, and thus the folkloric theorem is not equivalent to the original theorem. Theorem 2 establishes a similar, but \\"more subtle\\", NFL result for time-varying objective functions. ==Motivation== The NFL theorems were explicitly not motivated by the question of what can be inferred (in the case of NFL for machine learning) or found (in the case of NFL for search) when the \\"environment is uniform random\\". Rather uniform randomness was used as a tool, to compare the number of environments for which algorithm A outperforms algorithm B to the number of environments for which B outperforms A. NFL tells us that (appropriately weighted) there are just as many environments in both of those sets. This is true for many definitions of what precisely an \\"environment\\" is. In particular, there are just as many prior distributions (appropriately weighted) in which learning algorithm A beats B (on average) as vice versa. This statement about sets of priors is what is most important about NFL, not the fact that any two algorithms perform equally for the single, specific prior distribution that assigns equal probability to all environments. While the NFL is important to understand the fundamental limitation for a set of problems, it does not state anything about each particular instance of a problem that can arise in practice. That is, the NFL states what is contained in its mathematical statements and it is nothing more than that. For example, it applies to the situations where the algorithm is fixed a priori and a worst-case problem for the fixed algorithm is chosen a posteriori. Therefore, if we have a \\"good\\" problem in practice or if we can choose a \\"good\\" learning algorithm for a given particular problem instance, then the NFL does not mention any limitation about this particular problem instance. Though the NFL might seem contradictory to results from other papers suggesting generalization of learning algorithms or search heuristics, it is important to understand the difference between the exact mathematical logic of the NFL and its intuitive interpretation.Kawaguchi, K., Kaelbling, L.P, and Bengio, Y.(2017) \\"Generalization in deep learning\\", https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05468 ==Implications for computing and for the scientific method== To illustrate one of the counter-intuitive implications of NFL, suppose we fix two supervised learning algorithms, C and D. We then sample a target function f to produce a set of input-output pairs, d. How should we choose whether to train C or D on d, in order to make predictions for what output would be associated with a point lying outside of d? It is common in almost of all science and statistics to answer this question ‚Äì to choose between C and D ‚Äì by running cross-validation on d with those two algorithms. In other words, to decide whether to generalize from d with either C or D, we see which of them has better out-of-sample performance when tested within d. Note that since C and D are fixed, this use of cross-validation to choose between them is itself an algorithm, i.e., a way of generalizing from an arbitrary dataset. Call this algorithm A. (Arguably, A is a simplified model of the scientific method itself.) Note as well though that we could also use anti-cross-validation to make our choice. In other words, we could choose between C and D based on which has worse out-of-sample performance within d. Again, since C and D are fixed, this use of anti-cross-validation is itself an algorithm. Call that algorithm B. NFL tells us (loosely speaking) that B must beat A on just as many target functions (and associated datasets d) as A beats B. In this very specific sense, the scientific method will lose to the \\"anti\\" scientific method just as readily as it wins.Wolpert, D.H. (2013) \\"What the no free lunch theorems really mean\\", Ubiquity, Volume 2013, December 2013, However, note that NFL only applies if the target function is chosen from a uniform distribution of all possible functions. If this is not the case, and certain target functions are more likely to be chosen than others, then A may perform better than B overall. The contribution of NFL is that it tells us choosing an appropriate algorithm requires making assumptions about the kinds of target functions the algorithm is being used for. With no assumptions, no \\"meta-algorithm\\", such as the scientific method, performs better than random choice. While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research. If Occam's razor is correct, for example if sequences of lower Kolmogorov complexity are more probable than sequences of higher complexity, then (as is observed in real life) some algorithms, such as cross-validation, perform better on average on practical problems (when compared with random choice or with anti- cross-validation).Lattimore, Tor, and Marcus Hutter. \\"No free lunch versus Occam‚Äôs razor in supervised learning.\\" In Algorithmic Probability and Friends.

Neofolk may either be solely acoustic or combine acoustic folk instrumentation with various other sounds. ==History== Sol Invictus in live concert The term \\"neofolk\\" originates from esoteric music circles who started using the term in the late 20th century to describe music influenced by musicians such as Douglas Pearce (Death In June), Tony Wakeford (Sol Invictus) and David Tibet (Current 93). Anglo-American folk music with similar sounds and themes to neofolk existed as far back as the 1960s. Folk musicians such as Vulcan's Hammer, Changes, Leonard Cohen, and Comus could be considered harbingers of the sound that later influenced the neofolk artists. Also the later explorations of Velvet Underground's band members, specifically those of Lou Reed, have been called a major influence on what later became neofolk. ==Culture== A majority of artists within the neofolk genre focus on archaic, cultural and literary references. Local traditions and indigenous beliefs tend to be portrayed heavily as well as esoteric and historical topics. Various forms of neopaganism and occultism play a part in the themes touched upon by many modern and original neofolk artists. Runic alphabets, heathen European sites and other means of expressing an interest in the ancient and ancestral occur often in neofolk music. Aesthetically, references to this subject occur within band names, album artwork, clothing and various other means of artistic expression. This has led to some forefathers of the genre and current artists within the genre attributing it to being an aspect of a broader neopagan revival.\\"I'm very happy about that because I see Death In June as part of a European cultural revival. I'm pleased that the Old Gods are being resurrected, for want of a better word. Old symbols. I feel very pleased that I am a part of that process and that I have had influence. At this stage in the game, so to speak, it's not false modesty to say that I am content with my influence.\\" Powell, Erin. Interview with Douglas Pearce , 2005. Many such bands refer to this revival in metaphor, often borrowing terms such as Ernst J√ºnger's Waldg√§ng and using Fascist symbolism and slogans, this has led to an association of the genre with the far-right, though this is contested by fans.Anton Shekhovtsov (2009) Apoliteic music: Neo-Folk, Martial Industrial and ‚Äòmetapolitical fascism‚Äô, Patterns of Prejudice, 43:5, 431-457, DOI: 10.1080/00313220903338990 As a result some bands have stated opposition to the perceived Fascist apologia and themes in the genre and the related genre of martial industrial. ==Related terms and styles== ===Apocalyptic folk=== As a descriptor, apocalyptic folk predates neofolk and was used by David Tibet to describe the music of his band Current 93 during a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Created by Kirtley Mather, Edward A. Filene, and Clyde R. Miller, because of the general concern that increased amounts of propaganda were decreasing the public's ability to think critically. The IPA's purpose was to spark rational thinking and provide a guide to help the public have well-informed discussions on current issues. \\"To teach people how to think rather than what to think.\\" The IPA focused on domestic propaganda issues that might become possible threats to the democratic ways of life. :For the IPA, Nazism, communism, the conservative anti-communist movement, England‚Äôs foreign policy, and Latin American dictatorships were all undemocratic. By labeling these group as such, the IPA promoted a democratic society based on freedom of speech and citizen participation in government, and also attempted to accomplish concrete goals such as preventing the rise of Nazism in the America.Zachary Reich (2014) The Institute for Propaganda Analysis: Protecting Democracy in Pre-World War II America, Institutional Scholarship of Bryn Mawr College :The IPA's great strength stemmed from its particular fusion of academic and practical progressivism into an organized anti-propaganda critique that institutionalized the tradition of muckraking and also applied this characteristically American critical approach to the discontents of the Depression. ==Genesis== Edward A. Filene had amassed a fortune in meeting a mass demand, but he feared that democracy was threatened by propaganda preying upon the unsuspecting citizenry, so he asked Kirtley Mather to help him endow an effort to save democracy. A meeting on \\"education for democracy\\" was held March 29, 1937, at the University Club in Boston which attracted Alfred Adler, Lyman Bryson, Edward L. Bernays, and Clyde R. Miller among others.Sproule, Michael J. (1997) Propaganda and Democracy: The American Experience of Media and Mass Persuasion, Cambridge University Press At a second meeting in New York City, Filene provided Miller with a check for $10,000, presumably to finance the Institute in the first year. Filene‚Äôs Good Will Fund agreed on June 9 to continue the funding for three years. The Institute was incorporated on September 23, 1937. The initial board of directors was Clyde R. Miller, Robert S. Lynd, E. Ernest Johnson, James E. Mendenhall, and Robert K. Speer. Added to the board later were Charles A. Beard, Hadley Cantril, Ernest O. Melby, James T. Shotwell, and Percy S. Brown. The board elected its officers as follows: President: Cantril, V.P.: Melby, Sec.: Miller, Tr.:Speer In October 1937 the IPA distributed 3,000 copies of an Announcement edition of the Propaganda Analysis bulletin, soliciting subscriptions. The first two weeks produced 750, and there were 2,500 subscribers in the first year. Father Coughlin‚Äôs radio talks were selected by the IPA for analysis since they represented \\"a fairly typical borrowing of foreign anti-democracy propaganda methods by an American propagandist.\\"Alfred McClung Lee & Elizabeth Briant Lee (1939) The Fine Art of Propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin‚Äôs speeches, Harcourt, Brace and Company Seven tricks of the propagandist were outlined and illustrated by reference to the radio talks in a book The Fine Art of Propaganda, edited by Alfred McClung Lee and Elizabeth Briant Lee. As Clyde Miller explained in the Preface, \\"So far as individuals are concerned, the art of democracy is the art of thinking and discussing independently together.\\" The book is presented as a \\"candid and impartial study of the devices and apparent objectives of specialists in the distortion of public opinions.\\" Chapters four through ten described the following propaganda tricks: # Name- calling # Glittering generalities # Transfer # Testimonial # Plain folks # Card stacking # Bandwagon == Publications == To get their message across, the IPA distributed flyers, wrote several issues of the Propaganda Analysis Bulletin, and published a series of books, including: * Violet Edwards (1938) Group Leader's Guide to Propaganda Analysis * Alfred McClung Lee & Elizabeth Briant Lee (1939) The Fine Art of Propaganda * James A. Wechsler & Harold Lavine (1940) War Propaganda and the United States, reprinted 1972 by Garland Publishing * Propaganda Analysis * Propaganda: How To Recognize and Deal With It The bulletin Propaganda Analysis indirectly targeted the mass public through newspapers, educators, public officials, and thought leaders. The IPA directly targeted the presidents and deans of national colleges, bishops and ministers, educational and religious periodicals, and education students by sending out flyers. These \\"ABCs of Propaganda Analysis\\" encouraged readers to understand and analyze their own views on propagandistic material in order to promote informed, thought-provoking discussions: * Ascertain the conflict element in the propaganda. * Behold your own reaction element. * Concern yourself with today's propaganda associated with today's conflicts. * Doubt that your opinions are \\"your very own\\". * Evaluate, therefore, with the greatest care your own propaganda. * Find the facts before you come to any conclusion.Arthur B. Moehlman (Nov 1939) \\"Schools and Propaganda\\", Michigan Education Journal 17:216‚Äì9Edgar Dale (1940) Propaganda Analysis, an annotated bibliography from HathiTrust == Dissolution == The IPA faced many allegations that undermined its purpose. These suggested that the IPA created \\"more of a destructive skepticism than an intelligent reflectiveness.\\" The IPA lost support from many of its publishers and also faced internal conflicts through resignations by its board members and its troubled teachers. The approach of World War II also posed a problem. It would force the IPA not only to examine and criticize the enemy's propaganda, but assess America's use of propaganda as well. The IPA maintains the reason it suspended its operations in 1942 was due to lack of sufficient funds and not the war. After war was declared on Nazi Germany the neutral stance of propaganda analysis was untenable and the IPA folded in January 1942 with the final issue of its bulletin: :The publication of dispassionate analyses of all kinds of propaganda, 'good' and 'bad', is easily misunderstood during a war emergency, and more important, the analyses could be misused for undesirable purposes by persons opposing the government‚Äôs effort. On the other hand, for the Institute, as an Institute, to propagandize or even appear to do so would cast doubt on its integrity as a scientific body.\\"We Say Au Revoir\\", Propaganda Analysis 4:1 == Assessment == While the IPA existed many people sought assistance from the organization through the many publications that were available. The process includes teaching the audience to avoid emotion while being deceived by tainted propaganda. In order to get the facts, the Institute's authors wanted the public to \\"adopt scientific attitudes towards all questions of fact and to accept the conclusions to which they lead as a basis for action whether he [the student of propaganda] likes them or not.\\"IPA Propaganda, How To Recognize It and Deal With It, as quoted in S. I. Hayakawa (1939) \\"General Semantics and Propaganda\\", Public Opinion Quarterly 3: 197-208. The IPA encouraged students to think intelligently and independently on topics which they discussed. While many hailed the IPA for its guidance, others argued that the approach was \\"too simplistic because many messages fell into more than one category, and they do not account for differences between members of the audience, and do not discuss the credibility of the propagandist.\\" Despite controversy, the IPA was a resource available to American citizens in hopes of enlightening and activating minds to think freely and independently. In 1940 Edgar Dale and Norma Vernon wrote an Introduction to an annotated bibliography noting the IPA contribution: :Widespread teaching of propaganda analysis in the schools is due in large measure to the founding of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis in the summer of 1937. ¬∂ The articles annotated in this bulletin testify to the effect of the bulletins and worksheets of the Institute on the work of teachers throughout the country. Indeed, this very focusing on usable materials for the schools is one secret of the success of the institute. == References == * Delwiche, Aaron (2005) Propaganda references from Propaganda-critic. * Garber, William (September 1942) Propaganda Analysis‚Äîto what ends?, American Journal of Sociology 48(2): 240‚Äì245. * Jowett, Garth S. & O'Donnell, Victoria (1992) Propaganda and Persuasion, Sage Publications. * Waples, Douglas (1941) Print, Radio, and Film in a Democracy, University of Chicago Press. == External links == * PropagandaCritic.com offers analysis, with current and historical examples, of rhetorical tactics often used by propagandists, based on the framework developed in the 1930s by the IPA.

It was premiered in Prague on January 19, 1787,Deutsch 1965, 285 ISMN M-006-20466-3 during Mozart's first visit to the city. Because it was first performed in Prague, it is popularly known as the Prague Symphony. Mozart's autograph thematic catalogue records December 6, 1786, as the date of completion for this composition. Other works written by Mozart roughly contemporary with this symphony include the Piano Trio in B, K. 502 (completed November 18, 1786), the Piano Concerto No. 25, K. 503 (completed December 4, 1786), and scena and rond√≤ Ch'io mi scordi di te?, K. 505, for soprano and orchestra (completed December 26, 1786). ==Prague== Although Mozart's popularity among the Viennese waxed and waned, he was consistently popular among the Bohemians and had a devoted following in Prague. In spite of the fact that the Symphony No. 38 was first performed in Prague, it is not certain that it was actually written for Prague.See Freeman 2013, 238‚Äì46, for a discussion of the possible genesis of this work. Much of the confusion surrounds the chronology of its inception. It is clear that Mozart was invited to Prague on the strength of the reception of his opera Le nozze di Figaro during the 1786‚Äì87 winter season of the National Theatre (now called the Estates Theatre) in Prague. It is not known, however, when the run started, possibly in November 1786, possibly in December. No mention of the overwhelming success of Le nozze di Figaro is recorded in the Prague press until December 11, 1786, five days after the symphony was completed. It is certain that the opera's run began before that week, but there is no documentation to confirm when. It is known from a letter of Leopold Mozart written in January 1787 that Mozart was invited to Prague by a group of musicians and patrons. It is possible that this invitation came through long before Le nozze di Figaro was actually performed in Prague, perhaps during the time of rehearsals, when the brilliance of the music would have been recognized already by the musicians playing it. It is also possible that the Prague Symphony was intended to be performed for the Advent instrumental concerts given in Vienna in December 1786 along with the Piano Concerto No. 25, but all that can be established for certain is that it was not performed in Vienna before it was performed in Prague. The lavish use of wind instruments might offer a clue that the Prague Symphony was fashioned specifically with the Prague public in mind. The wind players of Bohemia were famed throughout Europe, and the Prague press specifically attributed the great success of the operas Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail and Le nozze di Figaro partially to their skillful deployment of wind instruments. It is also possible that the extensive use of winds in the Prague Symphony was simply the result of experiments with orchestration that Mozart had been cultivating in the orchestral accompaniments for his piano concertos for the previous two years and the new experience he had of writing for winds would have shown up in his symphonies regardless. No matter, the use of wind instruments in the Prague Symphony represents a major advance in Mozart's symphonic technique that was imitated in his last symphonies, and also by Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert. Indeed, it would be difficult to identify any earlier symphony by any composer not of a special type that contains so many passages in which no stringed instruments play at all, only various types of wind ensembles. ==Form== The early classical symphonies of the eighteenth century were originally cast in three movements (fast-slow-fast) following their origins in Italian opera overtures. Then, starting in the 1750s, it was normal in Germany and Austria to include a minuet to create the format fast-slow-minuet-fast. The Prague Symphony has no minuet, however, something that would have been extraordinarily unusual for a symphony written in Vienna in the late 1780s. Mozart himself, who wrote many more symphonies in the old-fashioned fast-slow- fast format than Haydn did (because of his closer connections with Italy), never before wrote a three-movement symphony for Vienna, not even as a child in the 1760s, when three-movement symphonies were still common in many parts of Europe. Daniel E. Freeman has suggested that the three-movement format might have been chosen as a means to appeal to the musical public of Prague.Freeman 2013, 238‚Äì46. It so happens that the only symphonist from Prague that Mozart ever knew well was Josef Mysliveƒçek, a close associate of the Mozart family between 1770‚Äì78. As it happens, almost all of Mysliveƒçek's symphonies are cast in the three-movement pattern favored in Italy, where he mainly worked throughout his adult life. Nonetheless, a definitive explanation for the three-movement format of the Prague Symphony is still lacking. The Prague Symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\override Score.NonMusicalPaperColumn #'line-break-permission = ##f \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Adagio\\" \\\\override TupletBracket #'direction = #-1 \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f d2~\\\\fp d4 r8. \\\\times 2/3 { a32\\\\f( b cis }  d4) r8. \\\\times 2/3 { a32( b cis } d8)[ r16 \\\\times 2/3 { a32( b cis] } d8)[ r16 \\\\times 2/3 { a32( b cis] }  d8) r fis\\\\p r a r d r  ais,2\\\\f } It has three movements, each of which is in sonata form: #Adagio ‚Äì Allegro, #Andante in G major, #Finale (Presto), The first movement begins with a slow introduction (he does this in only two other symphonies, No. 36 [\\"Linz\\"] and No. 39). Daniel E. Freeman has noted that it is probably the longest and most sophisticated slow introduction written for any major symphony up to that time, perhaps to compensate for the length of the missing minuet in order to help bring the entire work into closer alignment with the customary length of a standard four-movement symphony. The introduction gives way to the main portion of the movement, in which six melodies are developed and recapitulated in a very contrapuntal example of sonata-allegro form. Certain phrases in the first movement bear a resemblance to the overture to Die Zauberfl√∂te. The allegro proper opens in a complicated manner with the \\"first theme\\" traded off between the second violins (who start it) and the first violins (who finish it off). Musical material found throughout the first minor section of the first movement is similar to that of the overture to Mozart's Don Giovanni. Furthermore, the orchestral effects during this section are similar: winds and timpani announcing the chord with strings playing an even rhythmed harmony with the chord. The second movement's structure is not far removed from one found in a typical Mozart symphony dating to around this period although the music shifts into the minor-key in a movement of contrasting moods. It is in the subdominant key of G major. The third movement is a lively Presto in which the flute plays a prominent role, especially in counterpointing the main melody in the development section. This movement \\"shows Mozart in an unusual mood, nearer to Beethoven's boisterousness than his fastidious taste normally allowed him to go.\\"A. Hopkins, Talking About Symphonies Chapter III p. 45. Both halves of the movement have repeats.The Breitkopf & H√§rtel edition of the score (1880, see IMSLP) best known omits the \\"second repeat\\" from bars 152 to 350 of the finale, but this effective cut has been restored by the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe (1971), see link below- several minutes of music, 396 beats (198 bars of time in Presto.) ==Notes== ==References== *Deutsch, Otto Erich 1965, Mozart: A Documentary Biography, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press *Einstein, Alfred 1945, Mozart, his Character, his Work.

He was the Naval Commander during the Dieppe Raid of 1942. ==Early life and career== Hughes-Hallett was born in December 1901, to a distinguished armed services family. His father was Colonel Wyndham Hughes-Hallett, his mother Clementina Mary Loch (25-Mar-1869 - 8-Dec-1948). They were relatively old at 56 and 31 years old, respectively, at the time of his birth. Educated at Bedford School, Hughes-Hallett had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy, beginning as a Midshipman on HMS Lion, May 1918. He was promoted to staff rank and during the Second World War served in a variety of roles. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940 he saw active service on HMS Devonshire and was mentioned in despatches. ==Later naval career== In 1940 to 1941 Hughes-Hallett played a key role in cross-Channel raids. He assisted in planning raids under Mountbatten and was the Naval Commander during the misconceived Dieppe Raid of 1942. Although the raid itself was not successful and cost many lives, it did lead to new strategies for cross-Channel operations. The actual proposer of the idea of the Mulberry Harbour is disputed, but it is believed by some to have been Hughes-Hallett. At a meeting following the Dieppe raid, he declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the Channel. Although this was met with derision at the time, the concept of Mulberry Harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the Operation Overlord planners. Hughes-Hallett became Commodore commanding the Channel Assault Force and Naval Chief of Staff (X) from 1942 to 1943. Of the five Assault Forces, Hughes-Hallett's Force \\"J\\" started its training with a decided advantage over the other four; its nucleus having been formed as far back as October 1942, with headquarters at Cowes. On 1 May 1943, Commodore Hughes- Hallett succeeded Rear Admiral Philip Vian as the head of the Naval Branch at Supreme Allied Command. He served as Captain of HMS Jamaica from December 1943. After the war, he was in command of HMS Vernon, (1946-8). Vernon in Portsmouth was the navy's Torpedo training centre and he had to cope with the problems arising from the recent creation of the Electrical branch. Until this a ship's electrics had been looked after by torpedomen but they had become so complex a new separate branch was deemed necessary. He then commanded HMS Illustrious'(1948‚Äì1949) and after that was Vice-Controller of the Navy in Bath, 1950‚Äì1952, and then Flag Officer, Heavy Squadron, Home Fleet, 1952‚Äì3. A strict disciplinarian, he was sometimes known as 'Hughes-Hitler'. ==Political career== Hughes-Hallett retired from the Royal Navy in 1954 as Vice-Admiral on his adoption as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate. A problem arose when he enquired of the Secretary of the Admiralty what pension he could expect, at that time MPs got no pension, and the Secretary erroneously gave him a figure that was far too high. When he discovered this he threatened legal proceedings and as he was now an MP this was very embarrassing to the Government; it was discussed at Cabinet level on at least two occasions. (Cabinet Minutes in National Archives). First elected in September 1954, he served as the Member of Parliament for Croydon East, later Croydon North East, until the 1964 election, defeating Labour's Walter Wolfgang at the 1959 general election. He was a British Representative at the Council of Europe between 1958 and 1960 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport for Shipping and Shipbuilding, 1961 to 1964. In the 1958/59 parliament, he successfully piloted his private members bill through parliament, although only tenth in the ballot. It became the Road Traffic (Driving of Motor Cycles) Act. He was very popular among the Young Conservatives and always interested in their activities. ==Later years== In the late 1960s he suffered a serious stroke which hampered further activities. In his last years he lived in Slindon, near Arundel, Sussex, England and died in 1972. He never married. His brother, Sir (Cecil) Charles Hughes-Hallett was a Rear Admiral. He had drafted memoirs, but they have not as yet been published. ==Film portrayals== Captain Hughes- Hallett was a major character in the Canadian CBC miniseries Dieppe, in which he was played by actor Robert Joy.IMDb entry for Dieppe ==Homage== Around 1990, a street in Caen (France) was named after Commodore Hughes-Hallett,Caen map, La Poste, 1993. linking avenue Amiral Mountbatten to avenue Mar√©chal Montgomery and rue Colonel R√©my, in a district close to the M√©morial pour la Paix museum, where a majority of streets commemorate personalities linked with the Second World War, the R√©sistance, and the subsequent making of the European Community.

According to some accounts, it was formed in 1898 when sailors dumped cargo rocks overboard from a ship that was abandoned when its crew left for Cuba to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Another version of the story indicates that it was created when a large barge carrying sand and gravel ran aground on a shoal. A salvage crew was mounted there and the barge was rescued, but much of the sand and gravel it was carrying needed to be removed in order to aid the rescue. The workers dumped the sand and rock overboard to get the barge off the shoal, thus forming the reef.

In the 1940s, major American car makers began to manufacture specialized police cars.https://www.spillman.com/2013/08/04/history-police-cars/ ==Usage== In some areas of the world, the police car has become more widely used than police officers \\"walking the beat\\". Placing officers in vehicles also allows them to carry more equipment, such as automated external defibrillators for people in cardiac arrest or road cones for traffic obstructions, and allows for more immediate transport of suspects to holding facilities. Vehicles also allow for the transport of larger numbers of personnel, such as a SWAT team. Decommissioned police cars are often sold to the general public, either through a police auction or a private seller, after about 3‚Äì5 years of use. Such cars are usually sold relatively cheaply due to the extremely high mileage on such cars, in some cases exceeding the mark. In some cases, the cars are re-purposed as a taxicab as an inexpensive way for cab companies to buy cars instead of fleet vehicle services. In all cases, the cars are stripped of their police markings as well as most internal equipment; however the engines are usually left intact, and are often larger engines than their civilian counterparts. State of Israel police. ==Functional types== There are several types of police car. ===Patrol car=== Patrol car in Italy Patrol car in Hamburg, Germany The car that replaces walking for the 'beat' police officer. Their primary function is to convey normal police officers between their duties (such as taking statements or visiting warnings). Patrol cars are also able to respond to emergencies, and as such are normally fitted with visual and audible warnings. ===Response car (pursuit car)=== A response car is similar to a patrol car, but is likely to be of a higher specification, capable of higher speeds, and will certainly be fitted with audible and visual warnings. These cars are usually only used to respond to emergency incidents, so are designed to travel fast, and may carry specialist equipment, such as assault rifles, or shotguns. In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an Area car. ===Traffic car=== Traffic police cars, known in the UK as Road Policing Units, are cars designed for the job of enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and audible warnings, with special audible warnings which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs. ===Multi-purpose car=== Some police forces do not distinguish between patrol, response and traffic cars, and may use one vehicle to fulfill some or all roles even though in some cases this may not be appropriate (such as a police city vehicle in a motorway high speed pursuit chase). These cars are usually a compromise between the different functions with elements added or removed. ===Sport utility vehicles (SUV) and pickup trucks=== SUVs and Pickups are used for a variety of reasons; off-road needs, applications where a lot of equipment must be carried, K-9 units, etc. Some police departments use pickup trucks with cages for animal control units. ===Community liaison car=== Community Liaison car for the New South Wales Police Force This is a standard production car, visibly marked, but without audible and visual warning devices. It is used by community police officers to show a presence, transport them between jobs and make appearances at community events. These cars do not respond to emergencies. ===Unmarked car=== Mercedes-Benz E-Class Many forces also operate unmarked cars, in any of the roles shown above, but most frequently for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are a valuable tool in catching criminals while the crime is still taking place. In the United States, unmarked cars are also used by federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service, but can be recognized by their U.S. government plates, however they often have normal license plates. All unmarked cars bear license plates. Many U.S. jurisdictions use regular civilian issued license plates on unmarked cars, especially gang suppression and vice prevention units. Also see Q-car. Unmarked vehicles can range from normal patrol vehicles: Ford Explorer, Dodge Charger, Ford Crown Victoria, Chevrolet Impala, etc, to completely unmarked foreign vehicles: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, etc. There have been cases where criminals have pulled over motorists while pretending to be driving unmarked police cars, a form of police impersonation. Some US police officers advise motorists that they do not have to pull over in a secluded location and instead can wait until they reach somewhere safer. In the UK, officers must be wearing uniform in order to make traffic stops. Motorists can also ask for a police badge and peace officer identification.http://www.raa.com.au/membership/read- samotor/2017/Spring/stopped-by-the-cops-your-rights Motorists often have the option to call a non-emergency number (like Police 101 in the UK) or, if the country does not have one, the emergency number. This telephone call can then be used verify that the police car ( and officer(s) ) is genuine. ===Dog Squad=== ute (pickup) chassis, in Canberra. This type of car is used to transport police dogs. In some jurisdictions, this will be a station wagon or car based van, due to the installation of cages to carry the dogs. These units may also be known as K9 units (a homophone of canine, also used to refer to the animals themselves). These cars are typically marked in order to warn people that there is a police dog on board. ===Surveillance car=== Forces may operate surveillance cars. These cars can be marked or unmarked, and are there to gather evidence of any criminal offence. Overt marked cars may have CCTV cameras mounted on the roof to discourage wrongdoing, whereas unmarked cars would have them hidden inside. This type of vehicle is particularly common in the United Kingdom. In the United States, some police departments' vice, narcotics, and gang suppression units utilize vehicles that contain no identifiable police equipment (such as lights, sirens or radios) to conduct covert surveillance. Some police vehicles equipped with surveillance are Bait cars which are deployed in high volume car theft areas. ===High visibility decoy car=== Some police forces use vehicles (or sometimes fake \\"cut outs\\" of vehicles) to deter crime. They may be old vehicles retired from use, stock models restyled as police cars, or a metal sign made to look like a police car. They are placed in areas thought to be susceptible to crime in order to provide a high visibility presence without committing an officer. Examples of these can be seen on many main roads, freeways and motorways. In 2005, Virginia's (United States) legislature considered a bill which stated, in part: \\"Whenever any law-enforcement vehicle is permanently taken out of service ... such vehicle shall be placed at a conspicuous location within a highway median in order to deter violations of motor vehicle laws at that location. Such vehicles shall ... be rotated from one location to another as needed to maintain their deterrent effect.\\"; Such cars may also be used in conjunction with manned units hidden further down the road to trick speeders into speeding back up again, and being clocked by the manned car. In Chicago, Illinois a small fleet of highly visible vans are parked alongside major state and federal routes with automated speed detection and camera equipment, monitoring both for speeders and other offenders by license plate. Tickets are then mailed to the offenders or, in case of other crimes related to the licensed owner, may be served by a manned vehicle further down the road. ===Rescue unit=== In some jurisdictions, the police may operate a rescue service, and special units will be required for this. ===Explosive ordnance disposal=== In jurisdictions where the police are responsible for, or participate in, explosive ordnance disposal squads (bomb squads), dedicated vehicles transport the squads' crews and equipment. ===Demonstration cars=== An alt=AU11BZF LOTUS POLICE (9985004315).jpg Cars which are not for active duty, but simply for display. These are often high performance or modified cars, sometimes seized from criminals, used to try to get across specific messages (such as with the D.A.R.E. program), or to help break down barriers with certain groups (such as using a car with modified 'jumping' suspension as a talking point with young people). To show the police what is new, a marked police car with the manufacturer's name (Ford, General Motors, Chrysler) can be displayed with the words \\"Not In Service\\" to show what is new with that model of car and get feedback from police departments. Companies like Whelen, Federal Signal and Code 3 also have demo cars with their names on the side and showing the police what is new in the field of emergency vehicle equipment. ===Riot control vehicles=== These vehicles could be divided into three sub- categories. Modified trucks equipped with water cannons, modified stock cars and modified APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers). Their function is to help control riots. Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans. APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that unfold to create barriers. The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters. Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye (to mark the people that are present for later apprehension). Previously fire trucks were used as anti-riot vehicles of this type. As a non lethal, and effective method of clearing out protesters or rioters, the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) can be used. The LRAD is a device that can send announcements, warnings, and harmful pain-inducing tones. File:TOMA.JPGA Turkish TOMA water cannon of the General Directorate of Security in Turkey.

The one on the right, commonly known as a 'slicktop' in the US and Canada does not have a lightbar, making it less obvious, particularly when seen from the front (e.g. in a driver's rear-view mirror) A Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau car at Tiananmen Square. Police cars are usually passenger car models which are upgraded to the specifications required by the purchasing force. Several vehicle manufacturers, such as Ford, General Motors and Dodge, provide a \\"police package\\" option, which is built to police specifications in the factory. Police forces may add to these modifications by adding their own equipment and making their own modifications after purchasing a vehicle. ===Mechanical modifications=== Modifications a police car might undergo include adjustments for higher durability, speed, high-mileage driving, and long periods of idling at a higher temperature. This is usually accomplished by heavy duty suspension, brakes, calibrated speedometer, tires, alternator, transmission, and cooling systems, and also sometimes includes slight modifications to the car's stock engine or the installation of a more powerful engine than would be standard in that model. It is also usual to upgrade the capacity of the electrical system of the car to accommodate the use of additional electronic equipment. ===Safety equipment=== Police vehicles are often outfitted with AEDs (Automated external defibrillator), first aid kits, fire extinguishers, flares, life buoys, barrier tapes, etc. ===Audible and visual warnings=== Police vehicles are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or position on the road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such as the right to exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists to move out of the direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution. Visual warnings on a police car can be of two types: either passive or active. ====Passive visual warnings==== Passive visual warnings are the markings on the vehicle. Police vehicle markings usually make use of bright colors or strong contrast with the base color of the vehicle. Modern police vehicles in some countries have retroreflective markings which reflect light for better visibility at night. Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings. Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles. These markings are designed to have high contrast and be highly visible on the road, to deter crime and improve safety. Another passive visual warning of police vehicles is simply the interceptor's silhouette. This is easily observed in the United States and Canada, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles. Whatcom County Sheriff's Office- Stealth Dodge Charger (17248380012)Police vehicle marking schemes usually include the word Police or similar phrase (such as State Trooper or Highway Patrol) or the force's crest. Some police forces use unmarked vehicles, which do not have any passive visual warnings at all, and others (called stealth cars) have markings that are visible only at certain angles, such as from the rear or sides, making these cars appear unmarked when viewed from the front. ====Active visual warnings==== Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor with emergency lights system (ELS) activated. The active visual warnings are usually in the form of flashing colored lights (also known as 'beacons' or 'lightbars'). These flashes are used in order to attract the attention of other road users as the police car approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force. Several types of flashing lights are used, such as rotating beacons, halogen lights, or light emitting diode strobes. Some police forces also use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists. The headlights of some vehicles can be made to flash, or small strobe lights can be fitted in the headlight, tail light and indicator lights of the vehicle. ====Audible warnings==== Audible warnings on a police car in Toronto In addition to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating air siren, which made noise when air moved past it. Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. In North America for instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the \\"wail\\" setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a \\"yelp\\" setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the \\"wail\\". Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn audible warnings. Also in some European countries, where a hi-lo two tone siren is the only permitted siren for emergency vehicles, a \\"stadt\\" siren will be used in cities where it has loud echo that can be heard from blocks away to warn the traffic an emergency vehicle is coming, or a \\"land\\" siren will be used on highways to project its noise to the front to produce more penetration into the vehicles ahead to alert the drivers. A development is the use of the RDS, a system of car radios, whereby the vehicle can be fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into all RDS radios for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence, although is not able to alert pedestrians, non-RDS radio users, or drivers with their radios turned off. A new technology has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. The feeling is that of standing next to a large speaker with pumped bass.Washington Post With New Device, Police Shake, Rattle and Roll ===Police- specific equipment=== LED message board in Canberra, Australia Police officers' additional equipment may include: ; Two-way radio ; Equipment consoles:These are used to house two way radios, light switches, and siren switches. Some may be equipped with locking compartments for safe storage of firearms or file compartments. ; Suspect transport enclosures: These are steel and plastic barriers which ensure that a suspect‚Äîwho has been frisked, disarmed, handcuffed and seat belted, is unable to attack the driver or passenger and unable to tamper with equipment in the front seat. These may be simple bars or grilles, although they can include highly impact resistant but not bullet resistant glass. Many use expanded steel instead of plastic glazing for the upper half of the partition. ; Firearm lockers:In certain countries, including the United States, some police vehicles are equipped with lockers or locking racks in which to store firearms. These are usually tactical firearms such as shotguns or rifles, which would not normally be carried on the person of the officer. ; Mobile data terminal: Many police cars are fitted with mobile data terminals (or MDTs), which are connected via wireless methods to the police central computer, and enable the officer to call up information such as vehicle license details, offender records, and incident logs. ; Vehicle tracking system: Some police vehicles, especially traffic units, may be fitted with equipment which will alert the officers to the presence nearby of a stolen vehicle fitted with a special transponder, and guide them towards it, using GPS or simpler radio triangulation. ; Evidence gathering CCTV:Police vehicles can be fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the car. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This can then later be used in a court to prove or disprove witness statements, or act as evidence in itself (such as evidence of a traffic violation). ; Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR): This computerised system uses cameras to observe the number plates of all vehicles passing or being passed by the police car, and alerts the driver or user to any cars which are on a 'watch list' as being stolen, used in crime, or having not paid vehicle duty. ; Speed recognition device:Some police cars are fitted with devices to measure the speed of vehicles being followed, such as ProViDa, usually through a system of following the vehicle between two points a set distance apart. This is separate to any radar gun device which is likely to be handheld, and not attached to the vehicle. ; Remote rear door locking: This enables officers in the front to remotely control the rear locks‚Äîusually used in conjunction with a transport enclosure. Damage from a PIT maneuver on a Crown Victoria ; PIT bumper: The Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) bumper attaches to the front frame of a patrol car. It is designed to end vehicle pursuits by spinning the fleeing vehicle with a nudge to the rear quarter panel. Cars not fitted with a PIT Bumper can still attempt a PIT Maneuver at risk of increased front-end damage and possible disablement if the maneuver fails and the pursuit continues. ; Push bumper (aka nudge bars): Fitted to the chassis of the car and located to augment the front bumper, to allow the car to be used as a battering ram for simple structures or fences, or to push disabled vehicles off the road. ; Runlock: This allows the vehicle's engine to be left running without the keys being in the ignition. This enables adequate power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle's equipment at the scene of an incident. The vehicle can only be driven off after re-inserting the keys. If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the footbrake is activated. The installation of this equipment in a car partially transforms it into a desk. Police officers use their car to fill out different forms, print documents, type on a computer or a console, consult and read different screens, etc. Ergonomics in layout and installation of these items in the police car plays an important role in the comfort and safety of the police officers at work and preventing injuries such as back pain and musculoskeletal disorders.C√îT√â, Marie-Michelle et al.

The armor is typically made from ceramic ballistic plates and aramid baffles. A 2016 news report said that Ford sells 5 to 10 percent of their US police vehicles with ballistic protection in the doors. In 2017 Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, announced that all NYPD patrol cars would be installed with bullet-resistant door panels and bullet-resistant window inserts. ==In popular culture== Police chases have been dramatized in television programs and movies, and occasionally feature in television news coverage of unusual circumstances, showing footage from an airborne camera. In crime drama, such as Police procedural stories, police cars are often portrayed as containing a team of at least two police officers so that they may converse and interact with each other while on patrol. Depending on local policy, real patrols (especially rural and low population areas) may have only one officer per vehicle, although at night this may increase to two. ==Use by country== *Police vehicles in Australia *Police vehicles in Austria *Police vehicles in Belgium *Police vehicles in China *Police vehicles in the Czech Republic *Police vehicles in Denmark *Police vehicles in France *Police vehicles in Germany *Police vehicles in Greece *Police vehicles in Hong Kong *Police vehicles in Hungary *Police vehicles in Iceland *Police vehicles in India *Police vehicles in Indonesia *Police vehicles in Italy *Police vehicles in Japan *Police vehicles in Malaysia *Police vehicles in the Netherlands *Police vehicles in New Zealand *Police vehicles in The Philippines *Police vehicles in Poland *Police vehicles in Russia *Police vehicles in South Africa *Police vehicles in Spain *Police vehicles in Sweden *Police vehicles in Taiwan *Police vehicles in Turkey *Police vehicles in Ukraine *Police vehicles in the United Kingdom *Police vehicles in the United States and Canada ==See also== ===General=== * Armoured personnel carrier * Emergency vehicle * Mounted police * Police van * Road policing unit ===Other types of emergency vehicles=== * Police aircraft * Police bicycle * Police emergency wagon * Police motorcycle * Police truck * Police van * Police bus * Fire truck * Ambulance * Fire motorbike * Police watercraft * Black and white * D.A.R.E.

In measurement and statistics, the correction is also called disattenuation. The correction assures that the correlation across data units (for example, people) between two sets of variables is estimated in a manner that accounts for error contained within the measurement of those variables. ==Background== Estimates of correlations between variables are diluted (weakened) by measurement error. Disattenuation provides for a more accurate estimate of the correlation by accounting for this effect. ==Formula== Let \\\\beta and \\\\theta be the true values of two attributes of some person or statistical unit. These values are variables by virtue of the assumption that they differ for different statistical units in the population. Let \\\\hat{\\\\beta} and \\\\hat{\\\\theta} be estimates of \\\\beta and \\\\theta derived either directly by observation-with-error or from application of a measurement model, such as the Rasch model. Also, let :: \\\\hat{\\\\beta} = \\\\beta + \\\\epsilon_{\\\\beta} , \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\hat{\\\\theta} = \\\\theta + \\\\epsilon_\\\\theta, where \\\\epsilon_{\\\\beta} and \\\\epsilon_\\\\theta are the measurement errors associated with the estimates \\\\hat{\\\\beta} and \\\\hat{\\\\theta}. The estimated correlation between two sets of estimates is : \\\\operatorname{corr}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta},\\\\hat{\\\\theta})= \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta},\\\\hat{\\\\theta})}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\hat{\\\\beta}]\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}]} ::::: =\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\beta+\\\\epsilon_{\\\\beta}, \\\\theta+\\\\epsilon_\\\\theta)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta+\\\\epsilon_{\\\\beta}]\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\theta+\\\\epsilon_\\\\theta]}}, which, assuming the errors are uncorrelated with each other and with the true attribute values, gives : \\\\operatorname{corr}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta},\\\\hat{\\\\theta})= \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\beta,\\\\theta)}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]+\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\beta])(\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\theta]+\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\theta])}} ::::: =\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\beta,\\\\theta)}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\theta])}}.\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\theta]}}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]+\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\beta])(\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\theta]+\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\theta])}} ::::: =\\\\rho \\\\sqrt{R_\\\\beta R_\\\\theta}, where R_\\\\beta is the separation index of the set of estimates of \\\\beta, which is analogous to Cronbach's alpha; that is, in terms of classical test theory, R_\\\\beta is analogous to a reliability coefficient. Specifically, the separation index is given as follows: : R_\\\\beta=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]}{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\beta]+\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\beta]}=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\hat{\\\\beta}]-\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\epsilon_\\\\beta]}{\\\\operatorname{var}[\\\\hat{\\\\beta}]}, where the mean squared standard error of person estimate gives an estimate of the variance of the errors, \\\\epsilon_\\\\beta. The standard errors are normally produced as a by-product of the estimation process (see Rasch model estimation). The disattenuated estimate of the correlation between the two sets of parameter estimates is therefore : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{corr}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta},\\\\hat{\\\\theta})}{\\\\sqrt{R_\\\\beta R_\\\\theta}}. That is, the disattenuated correlation estimate is obtained by dividing the correlation between the estimates by the geometric mean of the separation indices of the two sets of estimates. Expressed in terms of classical test theory, the correlation is divided by the geometric mean of the reliability coefficients of two tests. Given two random variables X^\\\\prime and Y^\\\\prime measured as X and Y with measured correlation r_{xy} and a known reliability for each variable, r_{xx} and r_{yy}, the estimated correlation between X^\\\\prime and Y^\\\\prime corrected for attenuation is :r_{x'y'} = \\\\frac{r_{xy}}{\\\\sqrt{r_{xx}r_{yy}}}. How well the variables are measured affects the correlation of X and Y. The correction for attenuation tells one what the estimated correlation is expected to be if one could measure X‚Ä≤ and Y‚Ä≤ with perfect reliability. Thus if X and Y are taken to be imperfect measurements of underlying variables X' and Y' with independent errors, then r_{x'y'} estimates the true correlation between X' and Y'. ==See also== * Regression dilution * Errors-in-variables model == References == *Jensen, A.R.

Abroad, he attended the lectures of Karl Heinrich Rau's son Ludwig at Hohenhaven Agricultural Academy and Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher in Vienna. In Belgrade, the Matiƒá house was much more than just a place to stay. It was an educational experience for Jovanoviƒá in its own right. In Serbia, Matiƒá was –∞ Professor of Economics at Belgrade's Grandes √©coles, Minister of Finance, President of the Serbian Scientific Society and a corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy. In 1863 he went to Britain in order to raise sympathies in Britain for the efforts of Serbia to liberate herself from the Ottoman Empire. On that occasion, he published an essay \\"The Serbian Nation and the Eastern Question\\". In his travels, through Europe, he met leading political revolutionaries. On the eve of the 1866 war against Austria, Mazzini said to Vladimir Jovanoviƒá that Italy should not rely on France in her struggle against the Habsburgs, but on the South Slavs under Vienna's yoke. Revolutions were to have started simultaneously in Venice and in the Balkan provinces of Austria; the Magyar revolution which was to follow have brought about the end of the Habsburgs. He was a liberal thinker propagating emancipation, individual liberty, and education. Jovanoviƒá was influenced by John Stuart Mill and the British parliamentary system. Vladimir Jovanoviƒá was one of several major founding members of the Dru≈æina mlade≈æi srpske (Association of Serbian Youth, including Svetozar Miletiƒá, Svetozar Markoviƒá, Jevrem Grujiƒá, Milovan Jankoviƒá, Jovan Iliƒá, etc. The Youth was among the first organizations to raise the Serbian consciousness in all Serbian lands, then occupied by foreigners, European and Ottoman alike. His major work is the Political Dictionary (1870-1873). His son was Slobodan Jovanoviƒá, the leading Serbian interwar historian and jurist. ==Political career== Jovanoviƒá's life and political career are inseparable from the history of Serb liberalism. His first important public appearance was at the National Assembly in 1858, when it overthrew the autocratic power of Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. This was the first time that the liberals had acted as an independent political group. They demanded the restriction of the prince's power, the establishment of governmental rule, and the codification of human rights both in the civil and economic spheres. Jovanoviƒá was also deeply involved when the liberals first wavered and gave up much of their original program and principles, accepting the autocracy of the Obrenoviƒá princes, who were restored to power at the request of the National Assembly. The liberals were convinced that the most effective way of achieving their ultimate goals of liberating the Serb territories from Ottoman and Habsburg oppression and establishing an independent state was to have a prestigious dynasty and a strong, centralized power in the principality. Vladimir Jovanoviƒá drafted a Political Dictionary which was basically an encyclopedic summary of liberal ideas. The Dictionary was first published in Novi Sad, then under Austro-Hungarian rule, and written to popularize liberal ideas. It was considered the most ambitious and thorough liberal undertaking of the time, becoming \\"the Bible\\" for a new generation of liberal thinkers who started their career in the mid-1860s. The most typical characteristics of the so-called Omladina generation were that most of them had had a good foreign education (usually in Western Europe and Russia) and were all agreed on the need for the Serbs, who were scattered in four different states, to unite. Jovanoviƒá's book provided them with the guidelines they needed to accomplish the task. Unification, development, and Balkan hegemony: these were the most decisive elements of this philosophy. To justify these national aspirations, Jovanoviƒá resorted to Western type of liberalism, but wanted to adopt only those elements which were appropriate to their particular situation. Although his liberalism changed significantly over time, his philosophy had always been centered around the concept of nation. The effect of historical developments on his views may be demonstrated by the titles of his writings from different periods of time: The Base of the Power and Greatness of the Serbs was published in 1870 in Novi Sad, interpreting Serb history from a liberal point of view. The treatise, The Struggle for Life in Society between Nations was published under the aegis of the Serb Scientific Society in Belgrade in 1885, when Jovanoviƒá was already a recognized politician and an established political writer. ==Works== *In English: Serbian Nation and The Eastern Question, London: Bell and Daldy, 1863 *In Serbian:Politiƒçki reƒçnik (Political Dictionary), Novi Sad & Belgrade, vol.

There are eight instances (\\"lunch plates\\") fxyz of the problem, where x, y, and z indicate the goodness of a, b, and c, respectively. Procedure (\\"restaurant\\") A evaluates candidates in the order a, b, c, and B evaluates candidates in reverse that order, but each \\"charges\\" 1 evaluation in 5 cases, 2 evaluations in 2 cases, and 3 evaluations in 1 case. In computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method. No solution therefore offers a \\"short cut\\". This is under the assumption that the search space is a probability density function. It does not apply to the case where the search space has underlying structure (f.e. is a differentiable function) that can be exploited more efficiently (f.e. Newton's method in optimization) than random search or even has closed-form solutions (f.e. the extrema of a quadratic polynomial) that can be determined without search at all. For such probabilistic assumptions, the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical. A colourful way of describing such a circumstance, introduced by David Wolpert and William G. Macready in connection with the problems of search and optimization, is to say that there is no free lunch. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). Before Wolpert's article was published, Cullen Schaffer independently proved a restricted version of one of Wolpert's theorems and used it to critique the current state of machine learning research on the problem of induction. In the \\"no free lunch\\" metaphor, each \\"restaurant\\" (problem-solving procedure) has a \\"menu\\" associating each \\"lunch plate\\" (problem) with a \\"price\\" (the performance of the procedure in solving the problem). The menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard ‚Äì the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next. For an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other, the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant. But a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch. To methodically reduce the average cost, one must use advance knowledge of a) what one will order and b) what the order will cost at various restaurants. That is, improvement of performance in problem- solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems. In formal terms, there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results. In the case of search, a problem instance is an objective function, and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function. For typical interpretations of results, search is an optimization process. There is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions.Streeter, M.

This condition does not hold precisely in practice, but an \\"(almost) no free lunch\\" theorem suggests that it holds approximately.S. Droste, T. Jansen, and I. Wegener. 2002. \\"Optimization with randomized search heuristics: the (A)NFL theorem, realistic scenarios, and difficult functions,\\" Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 287, no. 1, pp. 131‚Äì144. ==Overview== Some computational problems are solved by searching for good solutions in a space of candidate solutions. A description of how to repeatedly select candidate solutions for evaluation is called a search algorithm. On a particular problem, different search algorithms may obtain different results, but over all problems, they are indistinguishable. It follows that if an algorithm achieves superior results on some problems, it must pay with inferiority on other problems. In this sense there is no free lunch in search. Alternatively, following Schaffer, search performance is conserved. Usually search is interpreted as optimization, and this leads to the observation that there is no free lunch in optimization. \\"The 'no free lunch' theorem of Wolpert and Macready,\\" as stated in plain language by Wolpert and Macready themselves, is that \\"any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.\\"Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) \\"Coevolutionary free lunches,\\" IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 9(6): 721‚Äì735 The \\"no free lunch\\" results indicate that matching algorithms to problems gives higher average performance than does applying a fixed algorithm to all. Igel and Toussaint and English have established a general condition under which there is no free lunch. While it is physically possible, it does not hold precisely. Droste, Jansen, and Wegener have proved a theorem they interpret as indicating that there is \\"(almost) no free lunch\\" in practice. To make matters more concrete, consider an optimization practitioner confronted with a problem. Given some knowledge of how the problem arose, the practitioner may be able to exploit the knowledge in selection of an algorithm that will perform well in solving the problem. If the practitioner does not understand how to exploit the knowledge, or simply has no knowledge, then he or she faces the question of whether some algorithm generally outperforms others on real-world problems. The authors of the \\"(almost) no free lunch\\" theorem say that the answer is essentially no, but admit some reservations as to whether the theorem addresses practice. ==No free lunch (NFL)== A \\"problem\\" is, more formally, an objective function that associates candidate solutions with goodness values. A search algorithm takes an objective function as input and evaluates candidate solutions one-by-one. The output of the algorithm is the sequence of observed goodness values.A search algorithm also outputs the sequence of candidate solutions evaluated, but that output is unused in this article. Wolpert and Macready stipulate that an algorithm never reevaluates a candidate solution, and that algorithm performance is measured on outputs. For simplicity, we disallow randomness in algorithms. Under these conditions, when a search algorithm is run on every possible input, it generates each possible output exactly once. Because performance is measured on the outputs, the algorithms are indistinguishable in how often they achieve particular levels of performance. Some measures of performance indicate how well search algorithms do at optimization of the objective function. Indeed, there seems to be no interesting application of search algorithms in the class under consideration but to optimization problems. A common performance measure is the least index of the least value in the output sequence. This is the number of evaluations required to minimize the objective function. For some algorithms, the time required to find the minimum is proportional to the number of evaluations. The original no free lunch (NFL) theorems assume that all objective functions are equally likely to be input to search algorithms. It has since been established that there is NFL if and only if, loosely speaking, \\"shuffling\\" objective functions has no impact on their probabilities. Although this condition for NFL is physically possible, it has been argued that it certainly does not hold precisely. The obvious interpretation of \\"not NFL\\" is \\"free lunch,\\" but this is misleading. NFL is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing proposition. If the condition for NFL holds approximately, then all algorithms yield approximately the same results over all objective functions. \\"Not NFL\\" implies only that algorithms are inequivalent overall by some measure of performance. For a performance measure of interest, algorithms may remain equivalent, or nearly so. ===NFL and Kolmogorov randomness=== Almost all elements of the set of all possible functions (in the set-theoretic sense of \\"function\\") are Kolmogorov random, and hence the NFL theorems apply to a set of functions almost all of which cannot be expressed more compactly than as a lookup table that contains a distinct (and random) entry for each point in the search space. Functions that can be expressed more compactly (for example, by a mathematical expression of reasonable size) are by definition not Kolmogorov random. Further, within the set of all possible objective functions, levels of goodness are equally represented among candidate solutions, hence good solutions are scattered throughout the space of candidates. Accordingly, a search algorithm will rarely evaluate more than a small fraction of the candidates before locating a very good solution. Almost all objective functions are of such high Kolmogorov complexity that they cannot be stored in a particular computer. More precisely, if we model a given physical computer as a register machine with a given size memory on the order of the memories of modern computers, then most objective functions cannot be stored in their memories. There is more information in the typical objective function or algorithm than Seth Lloyd estimates the observable universe is capable of registering. For instance, if each candidate solution is encoded as a sequence of 300 0's and 1's, and the goodness values are 0 and 1, then most objective functions have Kolmogorov complexity of at least 2300 bits, and this is greater than Lloyd's bound of 1090 ‚âà 2299 bits. It follows that the original \\"no free lunch\\" theorem does not apply to what can be stored in a physical computer; instead the so-called \\"tightened\\" no free lunch theorems need to be applied. It has also been shown that NFL results apply to incomputable functions . ==Formal synopsis of NFL== Y^X is the set of all objective functions f:X‚ÜíY, where X is a finite solution space and Y is a finite poset. The set of all permutations of X is J. A random variable F is distributed on Y^X. For all j in J, F o j is a random variable distributed on Y^X, with P(F o j = f) = P(F = f o j‚àí1) for all f in Y^X. Let a(f) denote the output of search algorithm a on input f. If a(F) and b(F) are identically distributed for all search algorithms a and b, then F has an NFL distribution. This condition holds if and only if F and F o j are identically distributed for all j in J. In other words, there is no free lunch for search algorithms if and only if the distribution of objective functions is invariant under permutation of the solution space.The \\"only if\\" part was first published by Set-theoretic NFL theorems have recently been generalized to arbitrary cardinality X and Y. ==Original NFL theorems== Wolpert and Macready give two principal NFL theorems, the first regarding objective functions that do not change while search is in progress, and the second regarding objective functions that may change. :Theorem 1: For any pair of algorithms a1 and a2 ::\\\\sum_f P(d_m^y  f, m, a_1) = \\\\sum_f P(d_m^y  f, m, a_2), where d_m^y denotes the ordered set of size m of the cost values y \\\\in Y associated to input values x \\\\in X, f:X \\\\rightarrow Y is the function being optimized and P(d_m^y  f, m, a) is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm a run m times on function f. In essence, this says that when all functions f are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of m values in the course of search does not depend upon the search algorithm. Theorem 1 establishes a \\"more subtle\\" NFL result for time-varying objective functions. ==Interpretations of NFL results== A conventional, but not entirely accurate, interpretation of the NFL results is that \\"a general-purpose universal optimization strategy is theoretically impossible, and the only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the specific problem under consideration\\". Several comments are in order: *A general- purpose almost-universal optimizer exists theoretically. Each search algorithm performs well on almost all objective functions. So if one is not concerned with the \\"relatively small\\" differences between search algorithms, e.g., because computer time is cheap, then you shouldn't worry about no free lunch. *An algorithm may outperform another on a problem when neither is specialized to the problem. Indeed, it may be that both algorithms are among the worst for the problem. More generally, Wolpert and Macready have developed a measure of the degree of \\"alignment\\" between an algorithm and a distribution over problems (strictly speaking, an inner product). To say that one algorithm matches a distribution better than another is not to say that either has been consciously specialized to the distribution; an algorithm may have good alignment just by luck. *In practice, some algorithms reevaluate candidate solutions. The reason to only consider performance on never-before-evaluated candidates is to make sure that in comparing algorithms one is comparing apples to apples. Moreover, any superiority of an algorithm that never reevaluates candidates over another algorithm that does on a particular problem may have nothing to do with specialization to the problem. *For almost all objective functions, specialization is essentially accidental. Incompressible, or Kolmogorov random, objective functions have no regularity for an algorithm to exploit, as far as the universal Turing machining used to define Kolmogorov randomness is concerned. So presume that there is one, clearly superior choice of universal Turing machine. Then given an objective function that is incompressible for that Turing machine, there is no basis for choosing between two algorithms if both are compressible, as measured using that Turing machine. If a chosen algorithm performs better than most, the result is happenstance. A Kolmogorov random function has no representation smaller than a lookup table that contains a (random) value corresponding to each point in the search space; any function that can be expressed more compactly is, by definition, not Kolmogorov random. In practice, only highly compressible (far from random) objective functions fit in the storage of computers, and it is not the case that each algorithm performs well on almost all compressible functions. There is generally a performance advantage in incorporating prior knowledge of the problem into the algorithm. While the NFL results constitute, in a strict sense, full employment theorems for optimization professionals, it is important to bear the larger context in mind. For one thing, humans often have little prior knowledge to work with. For another, incorporating prior knowledge does not give much of a performance gain on some problems. Finally, human time is very expensive relative to computer time. There are many cases in which a company would choose to optimize a function slowly with an unmodified computer program rather than rapidly with a human-modified program. The NFL results do not indicate that it is futile to take \\"pot shots\\" at problems with unspecialized algorithms. No one has determined the fraction of practical problems for which an algorithm yields good results rapidly. And there is a practical free lunch, not at all in conflict with theory. Running an implementation of an algorithm on a computer costs very little relative to the cost of human time and the benefit of a good solution. If an algorithm succeeds in finding a satisfactory solution in an acceptable amount of time, a small investment has yielded a big payoff. If the algorithm fails, then little is lost. ==Coevolutionary free lunches== Wolpert and Macready have proved that there are free lunches in coevolutionary optimization.Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) \\"Coevolutionary free lunches,\\" IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 9(6): 721‚Äì735 Their analysis \\"covers 'self-play' problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game.\\" That is, the objective is to obtain a good player, but without an objective function. The goodness of each player (candidate solution) is assessed by observing how well it plays against others. An algorithm attempts to use players and their quality of play to obtain better players. The player deemed best of all by the algorithm is the champion. Wolpert and Macready have demonstrated that some coevolutionary algorithms are generally superior to other algorithms in quality of champions obtained. Generating a champion through self-play is of interest in evolutionary computation and game theory. The results are inapplicable to coevolution of biological species, which does not yield champions. ==See also== * Evolutionary informatics * Inductive bias * Occam's razor * Simplicity * Ugly duckling theorem == Notes == ==External links== * http://www.no-free-lunch.org *Radcliffe and Surry, 1995, \\"Fundamental Limitations on Search Algorithms: Evolutionary Computing in Perspective\\" (an early published paper on NFL, appearing soon after Schaffer's ICML paper, which in turn was based on Wolpert's preprint; available in various formats) *NFL publications by Thomas English *NFL publications by Christian Igel and Marc Toussaint *NFL and \\"free lunch\\" publications by Darrell Whitley *Old list of publications by David Wolpert, William Macready, and Mario Koeppen on optimization and search Category:Mathematical optimization Category:Theorems in computational complexity theory ","title":"No free lunch in search and optimization"},{"id":"1297423","text":"Adam Davis Hyzdu (; born December 6, 1971) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

In most modern economies, most of the money supply is in the form of bank deposits. Central banks monitor the amount of money in the economy by measuring the so-called monetary aggregates.For example, in the United States, money supply measured as M2 grew from $6.407 trillion in January 2005, to 18.136 trillion in January 2009. See Federal Reserve (2009) In most nations that issue their own currency, there are unlimited intraday overdrafts that fund spending, for example in the UKpe Supplementary Memorandum by HM Treasury 2001. Hence, all government spending is money creation, and creates an amount of tax and saving, the opposite way round to how most think. ==Money supply== The term \\"money supply\\" commonly denotes the total, safe, financial assets that households and businesses can use to make payments or to hold as short-term investment.Money supply, FRS The money supply is measured using the so-called \\"monetary aggregates\\", defined in accordance to their respective level of liquidity: In the United States, for example, M0 for currency in circulation; M1 for M0 plus transaction deposits at depository institutions, such as drawing accounts at banks; M2 for M1 plus savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits, and retail money-market mutual fund shares. The money supply is understood to increase through activities by government authorities,\\"A [state budget] deficit will lead to a direct rise in the money supply if the...Treasury finances the deficit not by borrowing but by drawing down balances it holds at commercial banks or [the central bank].\\" From Cacy (1975) by the central bank of the nation,See \\"Money multiplier\\" and by commercial banks. ==Money creation by the central bank== ===Central banks=== The authority through which monetary policy is conducted is the central bank of the nation. The mandate of a central bank typically includes either one of the three following objectives or a combination of them, in varying order of preference, according to the country or the region: Price stability, i.e. inflation-targeting; the facilitation of maximum employment in the economy; the assurance of moderate, long term, interest rates. The central bank is the banker of the governmentFormally, the Treasury's banker, or the banker of the respective competent authority, depending on the country, e.g. of the Ministry of Finance and provides to the government a range of services at the operational level, such as managing the Treasury's single account, and also acting as its fiscal agent (e.g. by running auctions), its settlement agent, and its bond registrar. A central bank cannot become insolvent in its own currency. However, a central bank can become insolvent in liabilities on foreign currency. Central banks operate in practically every nation in the world, with few exceptions.List of central banks There are some groups of countries, for which, through agreement, a single entity acts as their central bank, such as the organization of states of Central Africa, Established by Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon which all have a common central bank, the Bank of Central African States, or monetary unions, such as the Eurozone, whereby nations retain their respective central bank yet submit to the policies of the central entity, the ECB. Central banking institutions are generally independent of the government executive. The central bank's activities directly affect interest rates, through controlling the base rate, and indirectly affect stock prices, the economy's wealth, and the national currency's exchange rate. Monetarists and some Austrians\\"The chief cause of inflation, Hayek wrote, is governmental control of the money supply.\\" argue that the central bank should control the money supply, through its monetary operations.\\"Empirical studies of relations between the monetary base and the total money supply establish a strong basis for believing that central banks can control the money supply.\\" Critics of the mainstream view maintain that central-bank operations can affect but not control the money supply.\\"Another common misconception is that the central bank determines the quantity of loans and deposits in the economy by controlling the quantity of central bank money. ... Rather than controlling the quantity of reserves, central banks today typically implement monetary policy by setting the price of reserves ‚Äî that is, interest rates.\\" McLeay (2014) ===Open-market operations=== Open-market operations (OMOs) concern the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank. OMOs essentially swap one type of financial assets for another; when the central bank buys bonds held by the banks or the private sector, bank reserves increase while bonds held by the banks or the public decrease. Temporary operations are typically used to address reserve needs that are deemed to be transitory in nature, while permanent operations accommodate the longer-term factors driving the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet; such a primary factor is typically the trend of the money-supply growth in the economy. Among the temporary, open-market operations are repurchase agreements (repos) or reverse repos, while permanent ones involve outright purchases or sales of securities.Open-market operations, FRS Each open-market operation by the central bank affects its balance sheet. ===Monetary policy=== Monetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, typically the central bank (or the currency board), manages the level of short-term interest ratesIt has been argued that the central bank of a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation can actually affect, if not dictate, the whole interest spectrum ‚Äì above which, of course, as it is argued, adjustments are made for their actual conduct of business by commercial banks and the private sector, in accordance to their assessments, objectives, and preferences. E.g.: \\"Monetary policy ‚Äì and there we are increasingly certain ‚Äì cannot only influence the expectations component, but also the term premium. ... Central banks can lower long-term rates by removing duration risk from the market.\\" C≈ìur√© (2017). Also: \\"There is no evidence that the central bank has any meaningful control over the...spread between the short-term and the long-term rate of interest [but] it is quite clear that the central bank has full control over the long-term rate of interest. and influences the availability and the cost of credit in the economy,Monetary policy, FRS as well as overall economic activity.IMF (3 November 2017) \\"Monetary Policy and Central Banking\\" Central banks conduct monetary policy usually through open market operations. The purchase of debt, and the resulting increase in bank reserves, is called \\"monetary easing.\\" An extraordinary process of monetary easing is denoted as \\"quantitative easing\\", whose intent is to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and promoting bank lending. ==Money creation by government spending== State spending is part of the state's fiscal policy. Deficit spending involves the state spending into the economy more than it receives (in taxes and other payments) within a certain period of time, typically the budget year. Deficit spending increases the money supply. The extent and the timing of budget deficits is disputed among schools of economic analysis. The mainstream view is that net spending by the public sector is inflationary in so far as it is \\"financed\\" by the banking system, including the central bank, and not by the sale of state debt to the public. The existence itself of budget deficits is generally considered inflationary by mainstream economics, so policies are prescribed for the lowering of the deficit,And of state debt while heterodox economists such as Post-Keynesians treat deficit spending as \\"simply\\" a fiscal policy option. == Role of banks in money creation == When commercial banks lend money, they expand the amount of bank deposits. The banking system can expand the money supply of a country beyond the amount created or targeted by the central bank, creating most of the broad money in a process called the multiplier effect. Banks are limited in the total amount they can lend by their capital adequacy ratios, and their required reserve ratios. The required-reserves ratio obliges banks to keep a minimum, predetermined, percentage of their deposits at an account at the central bank.Many countries in the world, including major economic powers, including Australia, Canada or New Zealand, do not impose minimum cash reserves on banks. This does not allow banks to lend without limit, since there is always, aside from other considerations, the capital adequacy ratio. The theory holds that, in a system of fractional-reserve banking, where banks ordinarily keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserves, an initial bank loan creates more money than it initially lent out. The maximum ratio of loans to deposits is the required-reserve ratio \\\\mathit{RRR}, which is determined by the central bank, as : \\\\mathit{RRR}=\\\\frac{R}{D} where R are reserves and D are deposits. In practice, if the central bank imposes a required reserve ratio (\\\\mathit{RRR}) of 0.10, then each commercial bank is obliged to keep at least 10% of its total deposits as reserves, i.e. in the account it has at the central bank. The process of money creation can be illustrated with the following United States example: Corporation A deposits $100,000 into Bank of America. Bank of America keeps $10,000 as reserves at the Federal Reserve (the central bank of the United States). To make a profit, Bank of America loans the remaining $90,000 to the federal government. The government spends the $90,000 by buying something from corporation B. B deposits the $90,000 into its account with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo keeps $9,000 as reserves at the Federal Reserve, and then lends the remaining $81,000 to the government. If this chain continues indefinitely then, in the end, an amount approximating $1,000,000 has gone into circulation and has therefore become part of the total money supply. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve itself can and does lend money to banks as well as to the federal government. There is currently neither an explanation on where the money comes from to pay the interest on all these loans, nor is there an explanation as to how the United States Department of the Treasury manages default on said loans (see Lehman Brothers). A negative supply of money is predicted to occur in the event that all loans are repaid at the same time. The ratio of the total money added to the money supply (in this case, $1,000,000) to the total money added originally in the monetary base (in this case, $100,000) is the money multiplier.The origin of the notion of a money multiplier is discussed i.a. in Hegeland (1970) In this context, the money multiplier relates changes in the monetary base,Also known as High-Powered Money, HPM which is the sum of bank reserves and issued currency, to changes in the money supply. If changes in the monetary base cause a change in the money supply, then : M_1=\\\\mathit{MB}\\\\cdot m \\\\, where M_1 is the new money supply, \\\\mathit{MB} is the monetary base, and m \\\\, is the money multiplier. Therefore, the money multiplier is : m = \\\\frac{M_1}{\\\\mathit{MB}} \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathit{RRR}} The central bank can control the money supply, according to this theory, by controlling the monetary base as long as the money multiplier is limited by the required reserve ratio. == Credit theory of money == The fractional reserve theory where the money supply is limited by the money multiplier has come under increased criticism since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. It has been observed that the bank reserves are not a limiting factor because the central banks supply more reserves than necessaryStandard & Poor's (13 August 2013) \\"Repeat after me: Banks cannot and do not lend out reserves\\", Ratings Direct and because banks have been able to build up additional reserves when they were needed. Many economists and bankers now believe that the amount of money in circulation is limited only by the demand for loans, not by reserve requirements. When a bank issues a loan of $1000 to a customer, they debit the customer's loan account with $1000 and at the same time they credit the customer's deposit account with $1000, ready for using. The bank now has a new asset of $1000 and a new liability of $1000. The bank's accounts are still in balance because the assets and liabilities are increased by the same amount. The bank's balance sheet is simply expanded with the amount of $1000. The bank does not take the $1000 out of its reserves. The $1000 are new circulating money that did not exist prior to the transaction. A study of banking software demonstrates that the bank does nothing else than adding an amount to the two accounts when they issue a loan. The observation that there appears to be no limit to the amount of credit money that banks can bring into circulation in this way has given rise to the often-heard expression that \\"Banks are creating money out of thin air\\". The exact mechanism behind the creation of commercial bank money has been a controversial issue. In 2014, a study titled \\"Can banks individually create money out of nothing? ‚Äî The theories and the empirical evidence\\" empirically tested the manner in which this type of money is created by monitoring a cooperating bank's internal records: > This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks > individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as > ‚Äòfairy dust‚Äô produced by the banks individually, \\"out of thin air\\". The amount of money that is created in this way when a loan is issued is equal to the principal of the loan, but the money needed for paying the compound interest of the loan has not been created. As a consequence of this process, the amount of debt in the world exceeds the total money supply. Critics of the current banking system are calling for monetary reform for this reason. The credit theory of money, initiated by Joseph Schumpeter, asserts the central role of banks as creators and allocators of the money supply, and distinguishes between \\"productive credit creation\\" (allowing non-inflationary economic growth even at full employment, in the presence of technological progress) and \\"unproductive credit creation\\" (resulting in inflation of either the consumer- or asset-price variety). The model of bank lending stimulated through central-bank operations (such as \\"monetary easing\\") has been rejected by Neo-Keynesian\\"By increasing the volume of their government securities and loans and by lowering Member Bank legal reserve requirements, the Reserve Banks can encourage an increase in the supply of money and bank deposits. Without taking drastic action, they can encourage but they cannot compel. For in the middle of a deep depression just when we want Reserve policy to be most effective, the Member Banks are likely to be timid about buying new investments or making loans. If the Reserve authorities buy government bonds in the open market and thereby swell bank reserves, the banks will not put these funds to work but will simply hold reserves.\\" and Post-Keynesian analysis as well as central banks.\\"In reality, neither are [bank] reserves a binding constraint on lending, nor does the central bank fix the amount of reserves that are available. ... Banks first decide how much to lend depending on the profitable lending opportunities available to them ‚Äî which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set by the [central bank].\\" McLeay et al. (2014) The major argument offered by dissident analysis is that any bank balance-sheet expansion (e.g. through a new loan) that leaves the bank short of the required reserves may affect the return it can expect on the loan, because of the extra cost the bank will undertake to return within the ratios limits ‚Äì but this does not and \\"will never impede the bank's capacity to give the loan in the first place.\\" Banks first lend and then cover their reserve ratios: The decision whether or not to lend is generally independent of their reserves with the central bank or their deposits from customers; banks are not lending out deposits or reserves, anyway. Banks lend on the basis of lending criteria, such as the status of the customer's business, the loan's prospects, and/or the overall economic situation. ==Physical currency== The central bank, or other competent, state authorities (such as the Treasury), are typically empowered to create new, physical currency, i.e. paper notes and coins, in order to meet the needs of commercial banks for cash withdrawals, and to replace worn and/or destroyed currency.Mankiw (2012) The process does not increase the money supply, as such; the term \\"printing [new] money\\" is considered a misnomer. In modern economies, relatively little of the supply of broad money is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010, in the United States, of the $8.853 trillion broad money supply (M2, table 1), only about 10% (or $915.7 billion, table 3) consisted of coins and paper money. See Statistic, FRS == Monetary financing == ===Policy=== \\"Monetary financing\\", also \\"debt monetization\\", occurs when the country's central bank purchases government debt. It is considered by mainstream analysis to cause inflation, and often hyperinflation. IMF's former chief economist Olivier Blanchard states that > governments do not create money; the central bank does. But with the central > bank's cooperation, the government can in effect finance itself by money > creation. It can issue bonds and ask the central bank to buy them. The > central bank then pays the government with money it creates, and the > government in turn uses that money to finance the deficit. This process is > called debt monetization. The description of the process differs in heterodox analysis. Modern chartalists state: > the central bank does not have the option to monetize any of the outstanding > government debt or newly issued government debt...[A]s long as the central > bank has a mandate to maintain a short-term interest rate target, the size > of its purchases and sales of government debt are not discretionary. The > central bank's lack of control over the quantity of reserves underscores the > impossibility of debt monetization. The central bank is unable to monetize > the government debt by purchasing government securities at will because to > do so would cause the short-term target rate to fall to zero or to any > support rate that it might have in place for excess reserves. ===Restrictions=== Monetary financing used to be standard monetary policy in many countries, such as Canada or France, while in others it was and still is prohibited. In the Eurozone, Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty explicitly prohibits the European Central Bank from financing public institutions and state governments.Fiscal policies, ECB In Japan, the nation's central bank \\"routinely\\" purchases approximately 70% of state debt issued each month, and owns, as of Oct 2018, approximately 440 trillion JP¬• (approx. $4trillion)At a $1=¬•0.0094 conversion rate or over 40% of all outstanding government bonds.Gov't Bonds, Bank of Japan In the United States, the 1913 Federal Reserve Act allowed federal banks to purchase short-term securities directly from the Treasury, in order to facilitate its cash-management operations. The Banking Act of 1935 prohibited the central bank from directly purchasing Treasury securities, and permitted their purchase and sale only \\"in the open market\\". In 1942, during wartime, Congress amended the Banking Act's provisions to allow purchases of government debt by the federal banks, with the total amount they'd hold \\"not [to] exceed $5 billion.\\" After the war, the exemption was renewed, with time limitations, until it was allowed to expire in June 1981. ==See also== * Commodity money * Fiat money * Fiscal policy * Functional finance * Gold standard * History of banking * History of money * Monetary economics * Monetary reform * Seigniorage ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Further reading== * *Federal Reserve historical statistics (11 June 2009) * * * ==External links== *\\"The Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems\\", Bank for International Settlements, August 2003 *Mitchell, William (2009) \\"Deficit spending 101: Part 1\\"; \\"Part 2\\"; \\"Part 3\\" Category:Monetary policy Category:Banking ","title":"Money creation"},{"id":"1297458","text":"C√©sar Milstein, CH, FRS (8 October 1927 ‚Äì 24 March 2002) was an Argentine biochemist in the field of antibody research. Milstein shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 with Niels Kaj Jerne and Georges J. F. K√∂hler for developing the hybridoma technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies.The Story of C√©sar Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies on WhatisBiotechnology.orgC√©sar Milstein archive collection ‚Äì Churchill Archives Centre finding aid ==Biography== Milstein was born in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina. His parents were M√°xima (Vapniarsky) and L√°zaro Milstein, a Jewish Ukrainian immigrant. He graduated from the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of Biochemistry). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu√≠mica Argentina for his work on kinetic studies with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the British Council, he joined the Biochemistry Department at the University of Cambridge at Darwin College to work for a PhD under Malcolm Dixon on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. During this work, he collaborated with Frederick Sanger whose group he joined with a short-term Medical Research Council appointment. ==Career== The major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with Georges K√∂hler (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the hybridoma technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies‚Äîa discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine. Milstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology‚Äîespecially in the use of monoclonal antibodies to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests.The Story of C√©sar Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant DNA technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics. Milstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies, which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died. Quite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific. ==Awards and honours== In addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1975, was a fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge from 1980 to 2002, awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1980, won the Copley Medal in 1989, and became a Companion of Honour in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian Konex Foundation granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country. ==Personal life== Milstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953. Milstein died early on 24 March 2002 in Cambridge, England at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years. The film \\"Un fueguito, la historia de C√©sar Milstein\\" was released in 2010. Directed by Ana Fraile, the film was awarded Best Documentary by the Academy of Film in Argentina.

It runs east to west, going from I-84 and I-291 in East Hartford to U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 44 in Bolton. ==Route description== I-384 at US 6 and US 44, its eastern end I-384 officially begins at I-84 eastbound Exit 59 at the East Hartford/Manchester town line, as the right 2 lanes of traffic split from the I-84 mainline. The highway can also be accessed from the I-84 eastbound HOV lane, and westbound I-384 traffic can also access the HOV lane on westbound I-84. Westbound I-84 access to I-384 is provided through a complex interchange that also provides access from Pleasant Valley Road near Buckland Hills Mall and from I-291. I-384's first exit is for Spencer Street. The eastbound ramp is on the I-384 mainline, while the westbound ramp comes from a split in the I-84 interchange ramp. Just east of the Spencer Street overpass, the ramp from westbound I-84 joins the I-384 mainline and the HOV lane becomes a conventional lane. I-384 continues along the southern part of Manchester. It has one interchange before it intersects Route 83, which provides access to Manchester Center. After one more interchange in Manchester, it crosses into Bolton, where it has a partial interchange with Route 85. Shortly after the interchange, I-384 ends as it meets the US 6/44 concurrency just west of its eastern split at Bolton Notch. The highway is 8 lanes wide west of Route 83, 6 lanes wide to Route 85, and four lanes wide for the rest of the highway's duration. ==Special designations== Since May 31, 1996, the segment of Interstate 384 \\"running from the junction of Interstate Route 84 in Manchester in a general easterly direction to Route 6 in Bolton\\" has been officially known as the State Trooper Russell A. Bagshaw Highway, in memory of a Connecticut State Police trooper who was killed in the line of duty.Connecticut Special Act No. 96-10. http://www.cslib.org/sa/sa10.htm ==History== Prior to 1984, Interstate 384 was designated Interstate 84. During that time, current Interstate 84 east of the East Hartford junction was Interstate 86. Originally, the freeway was supposed to end in Johnston, Rhode Island at the Interstate 95-Interstate 195 connector (now the Route 6-10 Connector). The freeway was built to Bolton where it abruptly ends at the intersection with US-6 and US-44; other isolated segments were built in Columbia, CT and Windham, CT, forming the present day US-6 bypass around Willimantic, CT, and a short segment of present day US-6 in Danielson, CT forming an interchange with I-395. Within Connecticut, the freeway was proposed, but never completed, between Bolton and the Route 6 bypass at Willimantic, and from the bypass to the interchange in Danielson. East of Danielson the proposed I-84 alignment would have paralleled the northeastern leg of the Connecticut Turnpike (SR-695) for about 5 miles to the Rhode Island border. Crossing into Rhode Island, the proposed I-84 freeway was to parallel US-6 to I-295, where it would have tied into the existing US-6/RI-10 freeway. In 1982, Rhode Island canceled their plans because of community backlash and possible impacts to the Scituate Reservoir. In 1986, Connecticut canceled their plans and changed I-86 back to I-84 and I-84 was renumbered I-384. Even after cancelling I-84, various proposals were made to complete the highway between Bolton and the Willimantic bypass or between the bypass and I-395. ==Future== For more than 30 years since the cancellation of the Hartford-Providence leg of I-84, elected officials in Connecticut proposed to extend I-384 from Bolton to Willimantic along the US-6 corridor, connecting the existing I-384 with the US-6 Windham Bypass, which would have likely included an extension of the I-384 designation to include the new freeway and the Windham Bypass. The corresponding stretch of US-6 is known as \\"Suicide 6\\" because of sharp turns and intersections had been the site of numerous fatal accidents, and was the main reason supporting construction of the bypass. It is unlikely the 11-mile freeway between I-384 and the Windham Bypass will ever be built because of irresolvable disagreements over the routing of the freeway: State and local officials prefer more northerly alignment that minimizes disruption to developed areas along US-6, while federal officials insist on a more southerly alignment that minimizes environmental impacts to the Hop River ecosystem. After studying more than 200 potential alignments with no agreement among stakeholders, the Connecticut Department of Transportation abandoned further study of the US-6 freeway in 2005, and instead focused on completing safety upgrades on the existing US-6 corridor between Bolton and Willimantic to reduce congestion and accidents. A proposed extension of the CTfastrak bus rapid transit line would run in the HOV lanes in I-84 and I-384. ==Exit list== I-384 looking east from Exit 3 ==References== ==External links== *I-384 in Connecticut @ Kurumi *Interstate 384 (Connecticut) @ NYCRoads.com 84-3 3 Interstate 84-3 Interstate 84-3 84-3 Category:Transportation in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Transportation in Tolland County, Connecticut ","title":"Interstate 384"},{"id":"1297463","text":"Diltor Vladimir Ara√∫jo Opromolla (13 April 1934, S√£o Paulo ‚Äì 15 December 2004, Bauru) was a Brazilian physician and dermatologist respected due to his lifetime work with leprosy patients and leprosy research.

Young Chang currently holds 50% of the South Korean piano market. The company is among the largest and most automated of the world's piano manufacturers. == Operations == Young Chang had four manufacturing facilities as of 1999, three producing pianos and the fourth a sawmill producing wood for export from the United States. The sawmill was located in Tacoma, Washington and was established in 1991. Piano manufacturing took place in plants in Seoul and Incheon, South Korea, both established in 1964, and Tianjin, China, established in 1995. The company also maintained a research and development facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The company's Tianjin manufacturing site is run through subsidiary Tianjin Young Chang Akki Company, Limited, while the Tacoma sawmill is managed through subsidiary Young Chang America Timber, Incorporated. As of the late 1990s, Young Chang, at the time known as Young Chang Akki Company, was among the largest of the world's manufacturers of pianos, alongside Samick, Yamaha and Kawai, and one of five multinationals producing pianos. Young Chang reported sales in the United States, China, Canada, Korea and the European Union under its own brand. The company also produces pianos for other companies. For instance, it began producing Cline pianos for Cline Piano Company of Belmont, California in 1992; and began producing Knabe pianos for Music Systems Research of Sacaramento, California in the late 1990s. Young Chang produced pianos for Nakamichi of Hamamatsu, Japan until 1998; the units were modified by Nakamichi before export to the United States. The company had at one time produced Wurlitzer pianos for United States-distribution by Baldwin Piano & Organ, but this relationship was terminated prior to the late 1990s. The company also markets under an alternative brand, Weber, held by subsidiary Weber Piano Company established in 1986. This brand was established specifically for English-speaking markets where a Korean brand name, as opposed to a German or American name, might be a disincentive to purchase. ==History== Young Chang was founded in 1956 as a distributor of Yamaha pianos for Korea and other parts of Asia. The company was founded by three brothers, Jai-Young Kim, Jai-Chang Kim and Jai-Sup Kim, as South Korea emerged as a major economy and producer of high quality goods. The first Young Chang factory was built in Seoul in 1964. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Young Chang manufactured Squier electric guitars and basses for Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, and also manufactured acoustic, acoustic/electric, electric guitars and basses under their own \\"Fenix\\" brand.Blue Book Of Electric Guitars 9th Edition Zachary Fjestad, Edited by S.P. Fjestad However, because of the similarities to the Fender brand and instruments, Young Chang could not sell the Fenix instruments due to licensing issues with Fender, and production stopped.In addition to guitars and pianos (vertical and grand varieties), Young Chang produced in the late 1990s harmonicas, reed organs and industrial woodworking machinery. In 1986, the company established Weber Piano Company, which sells pianos under the Weber brand name, which it had purchased rights to use after the demise of the Aeolin Piano Company in 1985. Young Chang subsequently sold this subsidiary to Samsung America in 1987. In 1988, Young Chang established a foundry for production of piano plates in Tianjin, China, to supplement production of this key component, also produced in Korea. The success of this facility was one factor leading to the 1995 establishment of a piano manufacturing facility in Tianjin. In 1990, Young Chang purchased Kurzweil Music Systems, a maker of high end electronic and digital musical instruments. In 1991, Young Chang invested to establish a subsidiary in Tacoma, Washington, Young Chang (America) Timber, to cut and process North American spruce and maple for export to its Asian manufacturing sites. In 1995, Young Chang opened a new factory in Tianjin. The Chinese facility allowed Young Chang to start serving the low-end markets, part of a long-term strategy involving shifting production from Korea to China. The quality of pianos produced by this new plant was initially high, but dropped sharply after technicians who had helped set up the production returned to Korea, which had a significant impact on their ability to complete sales. Joseph Pramberger, a former vice president from Steinway & Sons (head of manufacturing) and an experienced piano designer, joined the company in 1995. Pramberger brought many innovations to piano design, including the \\"Platinum Touch Action\\" and the patented asymmetrically tapered soundboard. The Pramberger Platinum series, introduced in 2001, was Young Chang's top-of-the-line for three years. These models incorporated some German materials including Renner action parts. Joseph Pramberger died in 2003, and the following year, his estate sold the Pramberger name to Samick, but his patents and innovations are still exclusive to Young Chang. The year following the opening of the Tianjin, China factory, in October 1996, Young Chang entered into bankruptcy, emerging in August 1998. Young Chang has more than 2,000 full-time workers, designing and building its upright and grand pianos, and also the electronic Kurzweil Music Systems.

Players attempt to guess if they have the highest card based on the distribution of visible cards and how other players are betting.

They consist of the Edwardian neoclassical-style Parliament House (1922); the Parliamentary Library (1899); the executive wing, called \\"The Beehive\\" (1977); and Bowen House, in use since 1991. Whilst most of the individual buildings are outstanding for different reasons, the overall setting that has been achieved \\"has little aesthetic or architectural coherence\\". ==Parliament House== Parliament House, completed 1922 The main building of the complex is Parliament House, containing the debating chamber, speaker's office, visitors' centre, and committee rooms. ===Predecessor building burned down=== An earlier wooden Parliament House (1870s addition by William Clayton and 1880s by Thomas Turnbull) was destroyed by fire in 1907 along with all other parliament buildings except the library. The library had an iron fire-door that saved its collections. Following the destruction of the building the Parliament occupied the adjacent Government House (the site now occupied by the Beehive) for ten years. ===Replacement building=== Parliament House in 1929, shortly after completion. The building to the left is Government House. A competition to find a replacement design was announced by Prime Minister Joseph Ward in February 1911 and 33 designs were entered. The winning design, by Government Architect John Campbell, was selected by Colonel Vernon, former Government Architect for New South Wales. As another of Campbell's entries won fourth place, the actual design is a combination of both entries. The design was divided into two stages. The first half, a Neoclassical building, contained both chambers and the second half Bellamy's (the parliamentary cafeteria) and a new Gothic Revival library to replace the existing one. Despite cost concerns, Prime Minister William Massey let construction of the first stage begin in 1914, but without much of the roof ornamentation or the roof domes. The outbreak of World War I created labour and material shortages that made construction difficult. However, members of Parliament (MPs) were so desperate to get out of the run-down old Government House that they moved into the unfinished building in 1918. In 1922, the first stage was completed (the second stage was never built). The building was finally officially opened in 1995 by Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, after its comprehensive strengthening and refurbishment. The intention of the Liberal Government was for the design to be implemented in stages, eventually resulting in a coherent architectural setting. Instead, as Heritage New Zealand remarks, the setting that has been achieved \\"has little aesthetic or architectural coherence\\", especially through the construction of the Beehive instead of completion of Parliament House. ==The Beehive== The Beehive, officially opened in 1977 The land intended for the second stage of Parliament House is occupied by the Executive Wing. This building conceived by British architect Sir Basil Spence in 1964, largely designed by the Ministry of Works, was officially opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand in 1977. The first parliamentary offices moved into the building in 1979. Due to its distinctive shape, it is referred to colloquially as \\"The Beehive\\". The building is ten stories and high. The top floor is occupied by the Cabinet room, with the Prime Minister's offices on the floor immediately below. The office of individual ministers, various function rooms, and Bellamy's restaurant occupy the first three floors. In the late 1990s there was consideration of moving the Beehive behind Parliament House, and finishing Parliament House according to the 1911 original plans. The plan was quickly scuttled due to a lack of public support and concerns about cost. ==The Parliamentary Library== Wellington Parliamentary Library building from 1899 Completed in 1899, the Parliamentary Library is the oldest of the buildings. It stands to the north of Parliament House (to its right, looking from the front). The library was designed in Gothic Revival style and was fire resistant, being constructed of masonry. The third story of the design was not built to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907 which destroyed the rest of the timber parliament buildings. Along with Parliament House, the library was strengthened and refurbished in the 1990s. This included recreating Gothic elements of the roof including ironwork, turrets, and finials. It still houses Parliament's library. The building is registered with Heritage New Zealand (previously known as the New Zealand Historic Places Trust) as a Category I heritage structure with registration number 217. ==Bowen House== Bowen House, behind the Wellington Cenotaph A 22-storey office building across Bowen Street from the Beehive, Bowen House houses MPs' offices and support staff and has been leased by Parliamentary Services since 1991. It is connected to the rest of the parliamentary complex by a tunnel under Bowen Street. ==Old Government Buildings== Not part of the current parliamentary complex and on the other side of Lambton Quay, this four-storey building was designed by William Clayton and built in 1876. The Old Government Buildings currently house Victoria University of Wellington's Law School as part of Victoria's Pipitea campus. Several rooms featuring displays of the building's history have been set up for public viewing. ==References== ==External links== *New Zealand Parliament website *New Zealand Parliament History and Buildings Parliament Buildings Parliamentary Buildings Parliamentary Buildings Category:Government buildings in New Zealand Category:Seats of national legislatures Category:Skyscrapers in Wellington Category:Fires at legislative buildings Category:Skyscraper office buildings in New Zealand ","title":"New Zealand Parliament Buildings"},{"id":"1297505","text":"Star Park is the name applied to several former sports stadiums in Syracuse, New York. The name referred to the Syracuse professional baseball teams, which were called the Stars beginning around 1870 and continuing in most seasons until the last Stars team was fielded in 1929. * The first of these venues was an alternate name of Newell Park, at the southeast corner of South Salina Street and what is now East Raynor Avenue. It was the home field of Stars teams from 1878 through 1884, including the Syracuse Stars of the National League in 1879. * The second, and longest-lived, Star Park opened in 1885, a couple of long blocks north of Newell Park. It was bounded by Salina, Taylor, Oneida and Temple Streets, with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad tracks running through a corner of the block.Kirst, Sean.

In addition to various Syracuse Stars minor league clubs through its two decades of existence, the field was the home of the Syracuse Stars of the major league American Association during the 1890 season. After 20 years of use, the city decided not to renew the ball club's lease, and ran what is now South Clinton Street through the property * The next Star Park was initially called Athletic Park. It was first the home of the Syracuse Stars minor league team in the Eastern League during 1900 and part of 1901. The Stars returned to the Salina and Taylor location during 1902 through 1904, after which the city closed it. The Stars then resumed play at Athletic Park, redubbing it New Star Park, which they used as members of the New York State League during the 1905 and 1906 seasons. Athletic Park / New Star Park was bordered by Marsh Street (later Hiawatha Boulevard) to the south, and by Pulaski and Liberty Streets. * After the 1906 season, the Stars moved again, about a mile northward, to a field called Hallock Park or First Ward Park or, again, Star Park. The Stars fielded teams in the New York State League from 1907 through 1917, then had another try with the International League, for 1918 only. This ballpark has been described as near the end of North Salina Street \\"not far from\\" Onondaga Lake, and Hiawatha Boulevard toward the southeast. What is now Park Street was to the northeast, across which there is now a Regional Market. The ballpark site itself was eventually swallowed by ramps for Interstate Highway 81. * The final version of Star Park, also known as Syracuse Athletic Park and International League Park, opened in 1920, and closed after the 1929 season. It was located at 1420 West Genesee Street, on the north side of that street between State Fair Boulevard and the New York Central tracks. It was the home of Stars teams in the International League during 1920 through 1927, and then a short-lived Stars entry in the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League during 1928, and part way through the 1929 season. :This last Star Park was also the home of the short-lived Syracuse Pros football team, who were \\"possible\\" members of the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League), in 1921.

The park was \\"very visibly downtown\\", its small block bounded on the west by Michigan Avenue, on the north by Randolph Street, and on the east by railroad tracks and the lake shore, which was then much closer than it is today. The site is now part of Millennium Park. == Baseball == Union Base-Ball Grounds was also called White-Stocking Park, as it was the home field of the Chicago White Stockings of the National Association in 1871, after spending the 1870 season as an independent professional club playing home games variously at Dexter Park race course and Ogden Park. The Great Chicago Fire of October 8 destroyed Union Base-Ball Grounds and all of the club's possessions. After fulfilling its 1871 obligations by playing on the road, the club did not field a team for the next two seasons, and the ballpark was not rebuilt.For the baseball season of 1872, the Chicago club leased another plot and built the 23rd Street Grounds that would be its home through 1877, renting it out chiefly to local clubs for two seasons before the White Stockings returned to the field in 1874. Several National Association games were played at 23rd St in 1872‚Äì1873: six in 1872, essentially because teams based in Cleveland and Troy were failing, and one in 1873 (Retrosheet). The Chicago club itself renewed play only in 1874 Lake-Shore Park 1883In 1878, the White Stockings returned to the 1871 site and to a new park that is usually called Lake-Shore Park, Lake Front Park, or simply Lake Park, which was actually the name for the entire waterfront area (not just the ballpark) until being renamed Grant Park in 1901.In 1883, the second Lakefront Park opened. The second Lakefront Park is noted for its extremely short dimensions. A ball hit over the wall was normally considered a ground rule double. However in 1884, these short dimensions allowed the Cubs to set home run records that would not be broken until Babe Ruth over 30 years later. Ned Williamson, Fred Pfeffer, Abner Dalrymple, and Cap Anson each hit over 20 homers, with Williamson leading the way with 27. It is Lake Front Park, often with a numeral I or II, in recent reference works including Retrosheet and the 1986 edition of Lowry. At the new park, the outfield area was especially close in right field. The right field fence was less than 200 feet away, so anyone hitting the ball over that fence was awarded only a ground rule double. Batters would aim for the fence, and during their years at the park, the Chicago club regularly led the league in doubles. In what would be their final season on the lakefront, the White Stockings decided to make the entire outfield fence home run territory. Thus, the team slumped in the number of doubles while boosting their home runs from typically a dozen or two to 142, easily outdistancing second place Buffalo, which had 39 for the season. The entire league's home run totals were up, thanks to the change to the Chicago ground rules. The team played at Lake- Shore Park through the 1884 season. After the season, the city reclaimed the land, and the White Stockings became a road team for the first couple of months of 1885 while awaiting construction of the first West Side Park. ==Football== The first college football game in the Midwest was played at the park on May 30, 1879, when the University of Michigan met Racine College.

Cretan traditional music includes instrumental music (generally also involving singing), a capella songs known as the rizitika, \\"Erotokritos,\\" Cretan urban songs (tabachaniotika), as well as other miscellaneous songs and folk genres (lullabies, ritual laments, etc.). Historically, there have been significant variations in the music across the island (more violin than lyra in far Eastern and Western Crete, a preference for the syrtos in Western Crete and kondylies in Eastern Crete). Some of this variation continues today and in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries has received greater attention by scholars and the mass media. Nonetheless, over the course of the twentieth- century, the sense of a single, island-wide Cretan musical tradition emerged. Although much Cretan music remains consciously close to its folk roots and an integral part of the fabric of many Cretans' everyday lives, it is also a vibrant and evolving modern, popular tradition that involves many professional and semi-professional musicians, numerous regional record companies and professional distributors, professional luthiers (especially of Cretan lyras and Cretan lutes), and Cretan kentra (clubs for dancing to live Cretan music). == Categories == === Instrumental (dances, kondylies, kantadha) === Much Cretan music includes the use of instruments (and usually singing, too). Lyra, violin, and laouto (Cretan lute) predominate, but other common instruments include the mandolin, mandola, oud, thiampoli (souravli), askomandoura, classical guitar (especially in Eastern Crete), boulgari, and daouli (davul). There is also an instrument known as the viololyra, a hybrid of the violin and lyra, which has enjoyed varying degrees of popularity at various times. Cretan music has been largely heterophonic in texture or accompanied by drones and fifth chords on Cretan lute, classical guitar, mandolin, boulgari, and so forth. Drones are also played simultaneously on melody instruments such as the lyra and violin by bowing a second string (usually open) simultaneously as one plays the melody notes on another string. Especially in earlier and more amateur settings where a second accompanying instrument was often absent, a lyra player accompanied himself by playing not only a drone string but also with a distinctively rhythmic bowing style in order to ring the gerakokoudhouna (small \\"falcon bells\\") that were attached to his bow. It is much more common today for the lyra to be accompanied by one or more other instruments, and for lyra players to employ a violin bow. Like much Greek folk music, Cretan music is closely related to dance, and the most common musical forms correspond directly with the Cretan dances that may accompany them, such as the Syrtos, pentozali, siganos, pidikhtos, and Sousta. Certain traditional dances from other regions of Greece, most notably kalamatianos and ballos, are also widely performed by professional Cretan musicians, usually with Cretan- composed lyrics, in musical gatherings since at least the twentieth century. Like fiddle tunes in various other traditions, Cretan dance music often involves repeated melodies or repeated pairings of melodies, whose selection and concatenation is improvised in performance. Another musical construction common to Cretan music is the taximi (), a rhythmically free, improvised instrumental solo (e.g., on the violin, lyra, or lute) in a particular scale or mode preceding the dance-song proper. (Both the word taximi and the musical form itself are cognates with the Arabic taqsim.) ==== Mantinadas ==== Much Cretan music is improvisational, especially in terms of its \\"lyrics.\\" Typically, the lyrics of Cretan instrumental music take the form of mantinadas (): fifteen-syllable rhyming (or assonant) couplets which have their origins in medieval Cretan poetry (as rhyming couplets) as well as in earlier (non- rhyming) forms of Greek verse (in the same fifteen-syllable form). Each line of a mantinada is divided into two hemistichs (), the first of eight syllables and the second of seven, and separated by a caesura. For this reason, sometimes when mantinadas are transcribed, they are broken into four shorter lines in a rhyme scheme of ABCB as opposed to the traditional form of a couplet. The metrical rhythm of mantinadas usually falls into eight successive iambs followed by an unstressed syllable, the form known in Greek as political verse and akin to the English-language fourteener and ballad stanza. There may be slight variations in meter. For example: > Œ§Œ± Œ∫œÅŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ œÑŒ± œáœéŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, œåœÄŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±ŒΩ œÑŒ± œÉŒ∫Œ¨œàŒµŒπœÇ, > Œ±ŒØŒºŒ± œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒ∫Œ±œÅŒπœéŒΩ Œ∏Œ± Œ≤œÅŒµŒØœÇ, Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒ± Œ∏Œ± ŒæŒµŒ∏Œ¨œàŒµŒπœÇ. > Ta Kritika ta chomata opou kai an ta skapseis > Aima palikarion tha vreis, kokala tha ksethapseis. > ŒÖWherever you happen to dig in Cretan soil, > You will find the blood of stout-hearted men, you will unbury bones. Mantinadas are written about a variety of subjects. Many focus on love, employ pastoral imagery, and use Cretan idiomatic Greek. Numerous folklorists since the early twentieth century have published large collections of mantinadas. Since the mid-twentieth century, some prolific mantinada composers have regionally published their mantinadas, much like other books of poetry. Some mantinadas are excerpted as stand-alone rhyming couplets from longer poems, particularly the Erotokritos, an epic poem that is a staple of Cretan Renaissance literature. Singers, professional and amateur alike, frequently improvise in the moment which mantinadas they sing or improvise entirely new ones on the spot. Sometimes a certain pairing of a particular mantinada with a particular melody (e.g., based on a well-known professional recording) will also congeal among much of the population and therefore tend to be repeated in performance. A common musical accompaniment for the improvisation of large numbers of mantinadas is called a kontilia (), a four-measure melody. The same kontilia (or a traditional pairing of kontylies) can be repeated for virtually any length of time, but musicians can also improvise changes in which kontylia is being played, stringing together different kontylies over the course of a performance. There is also a tradition of the kantadha (serenade) in Crete in which mantinadas are sung and improvised. The music of a kantadha may be kondylies or structured like the music of a syrtos (the dance form) but not actually intended for dancing or even necessarily sung at a tempo appropriate for dancing. === A Cappella singing (Rizitika) === There is also a strong a cappella tradition of mountain songs known as rizitika. The rizitika are conventionally divided into rizitika \\"of the road\\" (tis stratas) and rizitika \\"of the table\\" (tis tavlas). Since the twentieth century, an island-wide canon of rizitika songs has taken shape, especially in the wake of a commercially influential recording of them arranged by Yannis Markopoulos and sung by Nikos Xylouris in the early 1970s. Folklorists and other scholars have also published large collections of rizitika song texts. (For example, Rizitika: Dimotika Tragoudia tis Kritis by Stamatis Apostolakis.) === Erotokritos === There is also a vigorous tradition of singing excerpts of the Erotokritos to a specific set of tunes as a \\"song\\" genre in its own right (with or without instrumental accompaniment).The entire set of tunes will repeat as many times as required for the length of the excerpt that is being sung. Sometimes, rhyming couplets are excerpted from the Erotokritos and sung as mantinadas. The First Lines of the Erotokritos: > Œ§ŒøœÖ ŒöœçŒ∫ŒªŒøœÖ œÑŒ± Œ≥œÖœÅŒØœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, œÄŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ≤ŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒØŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ, > Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒøœÖ Œ§œÅŒøœáŒøœç, œÄŒøœÖ œéœÅŒµœÇ œàŒ∑ŒªŒ¨ Œ∫Œπ œéœÅŒµœÇ œÉœÑŒ± Œ≤Œ¨Œ∏Œ∑ œÄŒ∑Œ±ŒØŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ > Tou Kiklou ta girismata, pou anevokatevainoun, > kai tou Trochou, pou ores psila ki ores sta bathi piainoun > Of the great revolving cycle on which they travel, > and of the wheel, on which hours run high and low === Tabachaniotika === The \\"tabachaniotika\\" (; sing.: tabachaniotiko ‚Äì ) songs are a Cretan urban musical repertory of instrumental and vocal music which belongs to a broader family of urban genres. Major features of the tabachaniotika songs are Dromoi (sing:in Greek dromos ‚Äì Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒøœÇ) (i.e., modes) and musical instruments such as the [laouto and boulgar√≠ (ŒºœÄŒøœÖŒªŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÅŒØ, the Cretan orelse). Once again, the Cretan Mantinada often figures prominently in the words to such songs. One explanation of the origin of the word tambahaniotika is that they come from the eponymous district area of Greek city of Patras Œ§Œ±ŒºœÄŒ±œáŒ±ŒΩŒπœéœÑŒπŒ∫Œ±. Also, various conjectures are advanced to explain the meaning and origin of the term tabachaniotika. Kostas Papadakis believes that it comes from tabakaniotikes (œÑŒ±ŒºœÄŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒΩŒπœéœÑŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ), which may mean places where hashish ( 'tobacco') was smoked while music was performed, as was the case with the tek√©des (œÑŒµŒ∫Œ≠Œ¥ŒµœÇ; pl. of tek√©s) of other major urban centres. This kind of genre was found in Crete and Smyrna and was played with lyra and laouto. Unlike rebetiko, the tabachaniotika was not considered underground music and was only sung, not danced, according to Nikolaos Sarimanolis, the last living performer of this repertory in Chania. Only a few musicians played the tabachaniotika, the most famous being the boulgar√≠ (a mandolin-like instrument) player Stelios Foustalieris (1911‚Äì1992) from R√©thymnon. Foustalieris bought his first boulgar√≠ in 1924. In 1979, he said that in R√©thymnon, the boulgar√≠ had been widespread during the 1920s. An early twentieth-century variation of rebetiko around the Lakkos brothel district in Irakleio is indicative of a \\"hybrid music scene associated with cross-cultural interaction between different social and ethnic groups and musical traditions.\\" Notwithstanding the dearth of performers, tabachaniotika songs were widespread and could also be performed at domestic gatherings. Notable artists of this genre who were originally refugees from Asia Minor include the bouzouki player Nikolaos \\"Nikolis\\" Sarimanolis (ŒùŒπŒ∫ŒøŒªŒÆœÇ Œ£Œ±œÅŒπŒºŒ±ŒΩœéŒªŒ∑œÇ; born in Nea Ephesos in 1919) as a member of a folk-group founded by Kostas Papadakis in Chani√° in 1945, Antonis Katinaris (also based in Chani√°), and the Rethymnon-based Mihalis Arabatzoglou and Nikos Gialidis.Cretan Tradition ==History== ===Origins=== Cretan music, like most of the traditional Greek music, began as product of ancient, Byzantine music, with western and eastern inspirations. The first recorded reference to lyra was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, he cited the lyre (l≈´rƒÅ) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the (organ). The lyra spread widely via the Byzantine trade routes that linked the three continents; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lyra interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments. Descendants of the Byzantine lyra have continued to be played in post-Byzantine regions until the present day with few changes, for example the Calabrian Lira in Italy, the Cretan Lyra, the Gadulka in Bulgaria, and the Pontian lyra in Turkey. Following the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians dominated the island and introduced later new instruments and styles of music. In particular the three-stringed lira da braccio was introduced. By the end of the 14th century, a poetic form called mantinada became popular, a rhyming couplet of fifteen syllables. ===Post- Byzantine era=== After the fall of Constantinople, many Byzantine and Venetian musicians took refuge on Crete and established schools of music. A French physician in 1547 (Pierre Belon) reported warrior-like dances on Crete, and an English traveler in 1599 reported the wild dances performed late at night. The oldest transcription of folk songs in all of Greece can be traced to the 17th century, when songs in the rizitika type (see below) were mentioned by monks at Iviron and Xeropotamou Monasteries on Mount Athos. The connection between music and religion continues in modern Crete; priests are said to be excellent folk singers, including the rizitiko singer Aggelos Psilakis. It was during this period, when the modern Cretan folk music was formed, that Francisco Leontaritis was active. The explicit musical connection between Cretan music and Byzantine chant was documented in the seminal study \\"La chanson grecque\\" by Swiss musicologist and archivist Samuel Baud-Bovy. ===Twentieth-century consolidation=== Cretan lyras Cretan music underwent significant new developments in the twentieth-century, many related to professionalization, technology, and modernization, even as it remained closely interwoven with the fabric of many Cretans' everyday lives. Cretan music also continued to be widely performed by amateurs in everyday life as well. ==== Early masters (œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒøœÅŒµœÇ) ==== The advent of recordings, the growing ease of travel between regions on the island, and the modernization of instruments such as the lyra all contributed to the construction of \\"Cretan music\\" as a single, island-wide Cretan, and thus somewhat less locally or regionally bound, tradition. In the early 20th century, the violin was prominent in Cretan music in far Eastern and Western Crete. The modern form of the lyra appeared when a lyraki and violin were combined replacing the lyra drone strings with three strings in succession (d-a-e'). As a result, the range of the lyra was increased, and the lyra could start playing dances from the violin repertoire as well. Image:Common lyra tuning.gifCommon lyra Image:Lyraki tuning.gifLyraki Cretan music was recorded as early as 1917, and has continued to be recorded extensively ever since. Up until the Second World War, many early masters of the lyra, violin or laouto were recorded on 78, such as Antonogiorgakis, Harchalis, Kalogeridis, Kanteris, Karavitis, Lagoudakis (Lagos), Papadakis (Kareklas), Rodinos, Saridakis (Mavros). Many of these musicians and their recordings were largely forgotten in the wake of new waves of Cretan musicians and recordings artists after the Second World War, until their wider \\"rediscovery\\" upon the re-release of their music on compact discs and cassettes (and later online) starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ==== Mid-century ==== Certain widely recorded Cretan musicians, such as Kostas Mountakis and Thanasis Skordalos, further helped in the establishment and dissemination more widely across the island a shared repertory or canon of Cretan melodies. As late as the 1960s, most Cretan traditional music was largely considered rural and still widely looked down upon in Cretan cities. Nikos Xylouris was among a new generation of musicians and recording artists whose work further helped to popularize Cretan music in the cities of Crete and beyond. In the early 1960s, Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis based his theme music for the 1964 Cacoyannis film Zorba the Greek (itself based on the novel by Cretan author Nikos Kazantzakis) on Cretan syrta that had been recorded earlier by Giorgis Koutsourelis, such as on the hasapiko dance. The new dance was named \\"sirtaki\\" by choreographer Giorgos Provias. The film also shows clips of Cretan musicians performing Cretan music. Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis also included a Cretan-syrtos-inspired opening song in his Kapetan Michales cycle (1966), written for theater and based on Cretan author Nikos Kazantzakis's Captain Michalis (frequently translated as Freedom and Death). In 1968, German director Werner Herzog's short film Last Words includes extensive (uncredited) clips of Antonis Papadakis (Kareklas) and Lefteris Daskalakis performing Cretan music. ==== Late century ==== Chainides group Cretan music continued to be performed and to develop professionally throughout the 1970s. The 1970s was also a period for several important documentaries about Cretan music, such as those for Greek public television hosted by Domna Samiou. By the 1980s, some professional musicians were recording modern arrangements of Cretan music involving instruments such as the steel-string acoustic guitar, and more chordal accompaniments involving major, minor, and diminished harmonies. By the 1990s, there were numerous local radio and television shows dedicated to Cretan music. === Influence and contemporary fusions === Some contemporary musicians in Crete, including Ross Daly, have experimented with new kinds of music that have been heavily influenced by Cretan traditional music. Ethnomusicologist Kevin Dawe has noted that, \\"Recent fusions of Cretan/Greek, Turkish and various other oriental musics and musical instruments in both popular and traditional musics present a challenge to established notions of musical performance practice and musical identity.\\" ==Dances== * Ntames * Pentozali (siganos & grigoros) * Pidikhtos (Anogeianos & Ethianos) * Sousta (Rethemniotiki) * Syrtos, like in the music of mainland Greece is a dance in 4/4 time. On Crete this dance is typically accompanied by an up tempo Cretan lyra melody * Trizalis * Angaliastos * Maleviziotis == Sociology == Numerous scholars have noted that modern Cretan music has been a predominantly male domain and, in particular, serves as a site for performing one's \\"manhood.\\" Several scholars have examined the history and politics surrounding the violin versus the lyra as the primary musical instrument identified with the island and employed in its music. ==Cretan musicians== Some of the earliest popular music stars from Crete were Andreas Rodinos, Yiannis Bernidakis, Stelios Koutsourelis, Stelios Foustalieris, Efstratios Kalogeridis, Kostas Papadakis, Michalis Kounelis, Kostas Mountakis, Leonidas Klados and Thanassis Skordalos. Later, in the 1960s, musicians like Nikos Xylouris (Psaronikos) and Yannis Markopoulos combined Cretan folk music with classical techniques. For the above choices, Nikos Xylouris received the negative criticism of conservative fans of the Cretan music but he remained popular, as did similarly styled performers like Charalambos Garganourakis and Vasilis Skoulas. Nowadays, prominent performers include Antonis Xylouris (Psarantonis), Giorgos Xylouris (Psarogiorgis), Ross Daly, Loudovikos ton Anogeion, Stelios Petrakis, Vasilis Stavrakakis, the group Chainides, Zacharias Spyridakis, Michalis Stavrakakis, Mitsos Stavrakakis, Michalis Kontaxakis, Dimitrios Vakakis, Giorgos Skordalos, Georgios Tsantakis, Michalis Tzouganakis, Elias Horeftakis, Giannis Haroulis, and Giorgis Pantermakis. And of course the legendary man with the double mustache, Nikolas Gonianakis. ===Musicians=== Ross Daly *Ross Daly, lyra *Alekos Karavitis, lyra *Psarantonis, lyra, mandola *Antonis Papadakis (Kareklas), lyra *Giorgis Koutsourelis *Michalis Kounelis *Antonis Martsakis, violin *Kostas Mountakis, lyra *Stelios Petrakis, lyra, laouto *Giorgos Xylouris, laouto *Nikos Xilouris *Thanasis Skordalos, lyra *Kostis Moudatsos *Loudovikos ton Anogeion, mandolin ==See also== *Mantinada *Music of Greece *Cretan Greek *Cretan Lyra ==References== ==External Links== *Cretan Music *Cretan Dance *Cretan Music and Dance *ITE Research Database *Rethemnos Lyra Tradition (in Greek) *Violin Tradition in Cretan Music (in Greek) *Musical Tradition of Eastern Crete (in Greek) *Glentia.gr-Interactive Map of Live Cretan Music Concerts ===Streaming audio=== *128kbit/s Windows Media Stream (Internet-only station playing Cretan music) *32kbit/s Windows Media Stream (Studio Alpha ‚Äì Chania, Crete) Category:Greek music Category:Cretan music Category:Culture of Crete fr:Lyra (instrument)#Lyra cr√©toise ","title":"Music of Crete"},{"id":"1297520","text":"Lombard Street and Russian Hill from Telegraph Hill. The picture includes the famous \\"World's crookedest street\\" portion of Lombard Street. Russian Hill is a neighborhood of San Francisco, California. It is named after one of San Francisco's 44 hills, and one of its original \\"Seven Hills\\". ==Location== Russian Hill is directly to the north (and slightly downhill) from Nob Hill, to the south (uphill) from Fisherman's Wharf, and to the west of the North Beach neighborhood. The Hill is bordered on its west side by parts of the neighborhoods of Cow Hollow and the Marina District. At the northern foot of the hill is Ghirardelli Square, which sits on the waterfront of the San Francisco Bay, Aquatic Park, and Fisherman's Wharf, a popular tourist area. A trip down the winding turns of Lombard Street and across Columbus Avenue to the east leads to the neighborhood of North Beach. Down the hill to the west, past Van Ness Avenue, are Cow Hollow and the Marina districts. ==History== The neighborhood's name goes back to the Gold Rush era, when settlers discovered a small Russian cemetery at the top of the hill. Russian naval and merchant ships frequently visited San Francisco throughout the 19th century beginning in 1806, and there are several mentions of burials of crew members in the Russian Hill cemetery in the first half of the century. The cemetery was eventually removed, but the name remained. ==Noteworthy characteristics== View from Russian Hill (Larkin Street) towards east The neighborhood is most famous for Lombard Street, the one-wayLombard Street , AOL local. section on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, in which the roadway has eight sharp turns (or switchbacks) that have earned the street the distinction of being \\"the crookedest street in the world\\". The switchbacks design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and built in 1922, was intended to reduce the hill's natural 27 percent grade, which was too steep for most vehicles to climb. As it is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the city, this section of the neighborhood is frequently crowded with tourists. Tourists also frequent the cable car line along Hyde Street, which is lined with many restaurants and shops. A small park at the top of the hill on Vallejo Street features a small plaque and memorial placed by the Russian Government that is dedicated to the original Russian cemetery that is the neighborhood's namesake. Another park is named after Ina Coolbrith. Views from the top of the hill extend in several directions around the Bay Area, including the Bay Bridge, Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Russian Hill is home to the San Francisco Art Institute, located on Chestnut Street between Jones and Leavenworth Streets. Academy of Art University also maintains a presence in this neighborhood with their Chestnut St. building hosting their fine art MFA studios, photo classrooms, and photo studios. Because of the steepness of the hill, many streets, portions of Vallejo and Green streets, for example, are staircases. Another notable feature of Russian Hill are the many pedestrian-only lanes such as Macondray Lane and Fallon Place. Alice Marble tennis courts Alice Marble Tennis Courts are four hardcourt tennis courts located at Lombard and Hyde Streets. The courts offer a view of the bay and North Beach and can be unsuitable for tennis on windy days. A basketball court is located adjacent to the tennis courts. The San Francisco Cable Cars serving the Powell-Hyde line stops nearby. ==Government and infrastructure== San Francisco Police Department Central Station, Metro Division serves Russian Hill.Central Station, San Francisco Police Department District Stations and Map.

Much of the famous car chase sequence in the 1968 thriller Bullitt, starring Steve McQueen (whose character lived in Nob Hill on Taylor and Clay streets), were filmed on Russian Hill, notably the scenes on Taylor Street. The neighborhood was also featured in the early scenes of the 1982 action-comedy feature film, 48 Hrs. The cast of The Real World: San Francisco, which aired in 1994, lived in the house at 949 Lombard Street on Russian Hill from February 12 to June 19, 1994.Castmate Cory Murphy notes the address when first arriving in the season premiere. The dates in which the cast lived in the house are given by Judd Winick on pages 61 and 119 in his 2000 book, Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss and What I Learned. In Anne Rice's book The Wolf Gift, the main character, Reuben Golding, grew up in Russian Hill. John \\"Scottie\\" Ferguson, a character played by James Stewart lives at 900 Lombard Street in Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo (1958). Based on the view from the window, Admiral James T. Kirk's apartment seen in the films Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock was located in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco. In the racing video game Blur, one of the courses is named after and closely resembles Russian Hill. The unique and noteworthy character of the neighborhood, along with the narrowness and steepness of the city streets within it, are reasons why it makes sense for the course to be included in the game. ==See also== * San Francisco cable car system * List of San Francisco, California Hills ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * ==External links== * Chronicle's article \\"Russian Hill hike\\" from 1 Jan 2009 Category:Neighborhoods in San Francisco Category:Hills of San Francisco ","title":"Russian Hill, San Francisco"},{"id":"1297523","text":"The Sunfish is a personal-size, beach-launched sailing dinghy. It features a very flat, boardlike hull carrying a crab claw (\\"Oceanic lateen\\") sail mounted to an un-stayed mast. Sunfish was developed by Alcort, Inc. and first appeared around 1952 as the \\"next generation\\" improvement on their original boat, the Sailfish. In contrast, the Sunfish has a wider beam for more stability, increased freeboard and the addition of a foot-well for a more comfortable sailing position. Sunfish began as a wood hull design and progressed to fiberglass construction just a few years after its introduction. Having a crab claw sail with its simple two line rigging makes a Sunfish simple to learn sailing on and to set up. Upgrades can be added to enhance sail control for competitive sailing,Sunfish Class Association making the boat attractive to both novice and experienced sailors alike. Due to the broad appeal of the Sunfish, in 1995 it was commended by The American Sailboat Hall of Fame for being \\"the most popular fiberglass boat ever designed, with a quarter million sold worldwide\\" (at that point in time). Early in 2016, manufacturer Laser Performance moved production from Portsmouth, Rhode Island, US to China and boats were supplied to the 2016 World Championships. In 2017, Laser Performance (LP) announced the creation of a new governing body to manage the Sunfish Class, the International Sunfish Class Organization (ISCO), after the International Sunfish Class Association (ISCA), governing body since 1969, refused to sign a trademark agreement. In response the ISCA, still the World Sailing recognised Class Association, have announced rule changes which permit alternative suppliers to Laser Performance for some components. Today, the Sunfish brand-name has become so widely known it is often misapplied generically to refer to any brand of board-style boat sporting the characteristic crab claw sail.Clonefish article ‚Äì other brands of boats commonly misperceived of as Sunfish The design is currently manufactured by Laser Performance. ==Design== The distinctive low-aspect ratio crab claw sail gives the Sunfish an anachronistic appearance compared with today's more familiar high-aspect ratio Bermuda rig sailboats. However, this sail plan is not as old-world as it might first appear. Using a crab claw rig for this style boat shifts the advantage toward better performance in lighter air (less than 4 on the Beaufort scale) and contributes to it having good down-wind characteristics. The hull‚Äôs very mild \\"V\\" bottom and hard chine make Sunfish a most stable boat for its size, along with enabling it to sail on a plane (hydroplane). Planing allows the boat to achieve a speed greater than theoretical hull speed based on length at waterline (LWL). Having a down-wind performance advantage helps the Sunfish to achieve a planing attitude at lower wind speeds than its high-aspect ratio sail plan counterparts. Designed as a water-tight, hollow-body pontoon, a hull like the Sunfish has is sometimes referred to as \\"self-rescuing\\" because the boat can be capsized and its cockpit swamped without threat of the boat sinking. ==History== Sunfish Sailboat (Niagara River, Buffalo, New York; 1970) Children learning to sail in Dunewood, New York ===Beginnings of Alcort, Inc.=== In 1945, Alex Bryan and Cortlandt Heyniger created the Alcort company to produce their first boat design, the Sailfish. Originally framing carpenters by trade, these two entrepreneurs began their sailcraft endeavors building iceboats as a sideline. A proposal to build a lifesaving paddleboard for the Red Cross came their way. They determined the concept unfeasible as it stood. An improved design sporting a sailing canoe sail rig did however strike a spark as a possible profit making venture. From that humble beginning the Sailfish was born and seven years later an improved design, the Sunfish.The Sunfish Bible by Will White, Omega3 Press, Sarasota, FL ‚Äì \\"Background on the Boat\\" Sunfish (wooden; 1953) ===The kit boat niche=== The first Sailfish were offered in the form of detailed drawings for the backyard builder or as a finished, ready-to-sail boat, built by the Alcort shop. In the course of growing their business, Cortlandt and Alex had the revelation to kit the boat by supplying pre-cut pieces, all the necessary fittings, and inclusion of the sail thereby making backyard construction more appealing to an even wider range of would-be boat builders. Sunfish first appeared as either a DIY kit or a finished boat. Of the two designs, only the Sailfish was originally a blueprint plan boat. ===Waypoints=== * For the 1960 model year, Sunfish became available in a fiberglass version for the first time. Alcort shop-built wood boats were phased out around the same period, however, the Sunfish kit boat remained available through the late 1960s.Sunfish Sales Brochure ‚Äì 1968 * 1971 found a storage compartment added to the rear of the cockpit. * 1972 model saw a revision of the rudder blade's shape, the rudder's gudgeon and pintle, a new shape daggerboard, and a switch to a Sunfish designed cockpit bailer.

The racing setup seen in these photos shows the sail closer to the deck than the typical recreational rigging would be. For most One-Design Class eligible boats, the number of boats built and the number of boats registered in the racing class are closely related. This makes the boat and the racing Class practically one and the same. The Sunfish is an anomaly to this more familiar symbiotic relationship. The Sunfish Class Association reported in 2001, Sunfish production had exceeded 300,000 boats.Sunfish Class History The registrar for One Design sailing in the United States, US Sailing, reported in a 2004 survey, Sunfish Class membership numbered 1,573.

LaserPerformance also hosted a Sunfish 60th Anniversary Celebration at Noyes Pond in Massachusetts, the home of Sunfish designer Al Bryan, that gathered over 100 people sailing old and new Sunfish.http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6621572301 ==Super Sunfish== In the 1960s, a member of the New Canaan, Conn. Sunfish Fleet, John Black Lee, independently experimented with a conventional sail rig for the Sunfish. He developed a high-aspect ratio sail that worked on the Sunfish hull and christened his design the Formula S. The high aspect ratio sail plan has better upwind performance characteristics over the lateen sail, changing the boat's handling to point more like other Bermuda rig sailboats in its size. With this configuration, complexity of sail control is elevated by the addition of dynamic outhaul, downhaul, and mainsheet traveller lines. Lee's concept didn't interest Alcort, Inc. as a production model so he refit conversion boats independently and sparked organization of Formula S fleets. A few years after their 1969 purchase of Alcort, Inc., AMF revisited the idea of a high aspect ratio rig for the Sunfish. AMF did not choose to adopt Lee's Formula S design, they did however, develop their own variation calling it the Super Sunfish. The existing Formula S fleet eventually became assimilated into the ranks of AMF Super Sunfish fleets. The Super Sunfish was available from 1974 to 1984. AMF marketed this more conventional sail plan as a performance version of the Sunfish in an attempt to compete with, among others, the newly emerging Laser. Portsmouth handicap numbers, however, place the Laser slightly faster. With its hard chine hull, the Super Sunfish is the more stable boat so it's a tradeoff between the two designs. The Super Sunfish was offered as a complete package and as a kit to retrofit existing lateen rigged Sunfish. The literature points out the sail systems can be easily swapped on a single Sunfish hull to accommodate different sailors' preferences. {border=\\"1\\" +NORTH AMERICAN PORTSMOUTH NUMBERSCenterboard Portsmouth Numbers and Wind Dependent Handicaps - Centerboard Classes !

Since the potential energy is (stated to be) zero, the total energy E is equal to the kinetic energy, which has the same form as in classical physics: : E = T \\\\,\\\\rightarrow \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} =\\\\hbar \\\\omega As for all quantum particles free or bound, the Heisenberg uncertainty principles \\\\Delta p_x \\\\Delta x \\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} apply. It is clear that since the plane wave has definite momentum (definite energy), the probability of finding the particle's location is uniform and negligible all over the space. In other words, the wave function is not normalizable in a Euclidean space, these stationary can not correspond to physical realizable states. ===Measurement and calculations=== The integral of the probability density function : \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\psi^*(\\\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t)^2 where * denotes complex conjugate, over all space is the probability of finding the particle in all space, which must be unity if the particle exists: : \\\\int_\\\\mathrm{all\\\\,space} \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t)^2 d^3 \\\\mathbf{r}=1 This is the normalization condition for the wave function. The wavefunction is not normalizable for a plane wave, but is for a wavepacket. ===Fourier decomposition=== The free particle wave function may be represented by a superposition of momentum eigenfunctions, with coefficients given by the Fourier transform of the initial wavefunction: Section 4.1 : \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) =\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})^3} \\\\int_\\\\mathrm{all \\\\, \\\\textbf{k} \\\\, space} \\\\hat \\\\psi_0 (\\\\mathbf{k})e^{i(\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\omega t)} d^3 \\\\mathbf{k} where the integral is over all k-space and \\\\omega = \\\\omega(\\\\mathbf{k}) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k}^2}{2m} (to ensure that the wave packet is a solution of the free particle Schr√∂dinger equation). Here \\\\psi_0 is the value of the wave function at time 0 and \\\\hat\\\\psi_0 is the Fourier transform of \\\\psi_0. (The Fourier transform \\\\hat\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf k) is essentially the momentum wave function of the position wave function \\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf r), but written as a function of \\\\mathbf k rather than \\\\mathbf p=\\\\hbar\\\\mathbf k.) The expectation value of the momentum p for the complex plane wave is : \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\rangle=\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\left-i\\\\hbar abla\\\\right\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\hbar\\\\mathbf{k} , and for the general wave packet it is : \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\rangle = \\\\int_\\\\mathrm{all\\\\,space} \\\\psi^*(\\\\mathbf{r},t)(-i\\\\hbar abla)\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\int_\\\\mathrm{all \\\\, \\\\textbf{k} \\\\, space} \\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\hat\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf{k})^2 d^3 \\\\mathbf{k} . The expectation value of the energy E is : \\\\langle E\\\\rangle=\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\left- \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 \\\\right\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\int_\\\\mathrm{all\\\\,space} \\\\psi^*(\\\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\left(- \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 \\\\right)\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \\\\mathbf{r} . ===Group velocity and phase velocity=== Propagation of a wave packet, with the motion of a single peak shaded in purple. The peaks move at the phase velocity while the overall packet moves at the group velocity. The phase velocity is defined to be the speed at which a plane wave solution propagates, namely : v_p=\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar k}{2m} = \\\\frac{p}{2m} . Note that \\\\frac{p}{2m} is not the speed of a classical particle with momentum p; rather, it is half of the classical velocity. Meanwhile, suppose that the initial wave function \\\\psi_0 is a wave packet whose Fourier transform \\\\hat\\\\psi_0 is concentrated near a particular wave vector \\\\mathbf k. Then the group velocity of the plane wave is defined as : v_g= abla\\\\omega(\\\\mathbf k)=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\mathbf k}{m}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf p}{m}, which agrees with the formula for the classical velocity of the particle. The group velocity is the (approximate) speed at which the whole wave packet propagates, while the phase velocity is the speed at which the individual peaks in the wave packet move. Sections 4.3 and 4.4 The figure illustrates this phenomenon, with the individual peaks within the wave packet propagating at half the speed of the overall packet. ===Spread of the wave packet=== The notion of group velocity is based on a linear approximation to the dispersion relation \\\\omega(k) near a particular value of k. Equation 4.24 In this approximation, the amplitude of the wave packet moves at a velocity equal to the group velocity without changing shape. This result is an approximation that fails to capture certain interesting aspects of the evolution a free quantum particle. Notably, the width of the wave packet, as measured by the uncertainty in the position, grows linearly in time for large times. This phenomenon is called the spread of the wave packet for a free particle. Specifically, it is not difficult to compute an exact formula for the uncertainty \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi(t)}X as a function of time, where X is the position operator. Working in one spatial dimension for simplicity, we have: Proposition 4.10 :(\\\\Delta_{\\\\psi(t)}X)^2=\\\\frac{t^2}{m^2}(\\\\Delta_{\\\\psi_0}P)^2+\\\\frac{2t}{m}\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{XP+PX}{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\psi_0}-\\\\left\\\\langle X\\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\psi_0} \\\\left\\\\langle P\\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\psi_0} \\\\right)+(\\\\Delta_{\\\\psi_0}X)^2, where \\\\psi_0 is the time-zero wave function. The expression in parentheses in the second term on the right-hand side is the quantum covariance of X and P. Thus, for large positive times, the uncertainty in X grows linearly, with the coefficient of t equal to (\\\\Delta_{\\\\psi_0}P)/m. If the momentum of the initial wave function \\\\psi_0 is highly localized, the wave packet will spread slowly and the group-velocity approximation will remain good for a long time. Intuitively, this result says that if the initial wave function has a very sharply defined momentum, then the particle has a sharply defined velocity and will (to good approximation) propagate at this velocity for a long time. ==Relativistic quantum free particle== There are a number of equations describing relativistic particles: see relativistic wave equations. ==See also== * Wave packet * Group velocity * Particle in a box * Finite square well * Delta potential ==References== * Quantum Mechanics, E.

More of the 2LO transmitting equipment. 2LO was the second radio station to regularly broadcast in the United Kingdom (the first was 2MT). It began broadcasting on 11 May 1922, for one hour a day from the seventh floor of Marconi House in London's Strand, opposite Somerset House. Initially the power was 100 watts on 350 metres (857 kHz). 2LO was allowed to transmit for seven minutes, after which the \\"operator\\" had to listen on the wavelength for three minutes for possible instructions to close down. On 14 November 1922 the station was transferred to the new British Broadcasting Company which in 1923 took up the nearby Savoy Hill for its broadcasting studios. In 1927 the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation. On 9 March 1930 2LO was replaced by the BBC Regional Programme and the BBC National Programme. The letters LO continued to be used internally as a designation in the BBC for technical operations in the London area (for example, the numbering of all recordings made in London contained LO). The code LO was changed to LN in the early 1970s. The 2LO transmitter now belongs to the Science Museum, having been donated by Crown Castle International on 7 November 2002.Gift to nation marks BBC's 80th anniversary BBC Press Office, 3 November 2002 It is now on show in the Information Age gallery on the second floor of the museum.

The station is on the Central line, between and stations, and it lies in Travelcard Zone 2. The station originally opened in 1900, but was closed for eight months in 2008 while the surface station building was replaced with a completely new structure and the underground station refurbished. A number of stations in the area both past and present have borne the name Shepherd's Bush; today the Central line station shares its name with the adjacent London Overground station, with which it shares a surface-level interchange. An entirely separate London Underground station, on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines is located approximately away. Until 2008, it too was called Shepherd's Bush until it was renamed to avoid confusion. ==History== Map showing layout of current and former railways and stations around Shepherd's Bush The station opened on 30 July 1900 and was the original western terminus of the Central London Railway (CLR). The original surface-level station building was a terracotta-clad ticket hall with its entrance on the Uxbridge Road facing Shepherd's Bush Green. Like all CLR stations, the station building was designed by Harry Bell Measures. To the north of the station was located the CLR's power station and Wood Lane depot which was originally accessed by a single track tunnel. The eastbound tunnel ended to the west of the station in a dead-end reversing siding with a cross-over junction connecting it to the westbound tunnel. When the now disused Wood Lane station was opened on 14 May 1908 to the north, a loop tunnel was created connecting to the eastbound tunnel. An extension to Richmond planned in 1920 would have started here with the next stop at the closed London and South Western Railway station at Hammersmith (Grove Road); the work was never carried out. As part of London Transport's New Works Programme, 1935 - 1940, escalators were installed to replace the original lifts and in 1938, the platforms were lengthened along with those of the other existing Central line stations to accommodate eight cars instead of the previous seven. ==Westfield redevelopment== An eastbound train calls at the station A large-scale redevelopment began in 2005 to redevelop the White City area to the north of Shepherd's Bush Green and to construct the Westfield Shopping Centre. As part of this project, Shepherd's Bush Central line station was reconstructed in 2008 by Westfield as part of a Section 106 contribution. The Westfield redevelopment also included the construction of an integrated bus interchange and the new London Overground station on the West London line. The new Overground station opened on 28 September that year and is close to the site of the former station which closed in 1940. During the reconstruction of the Central line station, Transport for London closed the station completely for eight months from 4 February 2008; TfL based their decision on the need to replace the escalators at the same time as rebuilding work. This decision caused local controversy, and critics claimed that the works had been timed to benefit incoming businesses involved in the planned redevelopment of the area, at the cost of local residents and small business holders. The local MP for the Shepherd's Bush constituency, Andy Slaughter, investigated the project and obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act which showed that the contractor, Metronet, had advised that the work could be completed without closing the station. Shepherd's Bush station re-opened to passengers on 5 October that year. During the refurbishment, Transport for London did not add lifts to the station as originally planned, citing installation costs of ¬£100 million due to the various underground utilities nearby which would have to be diverted. The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and disability pressure groups have been critical of the fact that the station remains inaccessible for those unable to use stairs. ==Connections== *Shepherd's Bush station is an OSI for London Overground and National Rail *London Buses routes 31, 49, 72, 94, 95, 148, 207, 220, 228, 237, 260, 272, 283, 295, 316, 607 and C1 and night route N207 serve the station and bus station. ==See also== *Shepherd's Bush stations ==Gallery== File:Shepherds bush tube station 1.jpgBefore: the original 1900 building as seen in 2005 File:Shepherd's Bush Central Line station almost rebuilt - geograph.org.uk - 934452.jpgAfter: the replacement building nears completion in 2008 File:Shepherd's Bush tube stn westbound look east.JPGWestbound platform looking east File:Shepherd's Bush tube stn roundel.JPGPlatform roundel ==References== ==External links== * London Transport Museum Photographic Archive ** ** ** * Details of infrastructure improvements * The front of the station building from a different angle Category:Central line stations Category:London Underground Night Tube stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Category:Former Central London Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1900 Tube station Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ","title":"Shepherd's Bush tube station"},{"id":"1297564","text":"Alexander Mullings \\"Alex\\" Sanders, Jr. (born September 29, 1939) is an American politician from the state of South Carolina.

It is on the Circle and Hammersmith & City Lines, between Goldhawk Road and Wood Lane stations, and it is in Travelcard Zone 2. Shepherd's Bush Market, from which the station takes its name, is an open-air market which runs parallel to the railway line. ==History== Original Shepherd's Bush station on a map of 1894 Stations around Shepherd's Bush The Metropolitan Railway (MR) opened the original station on 13 June 1864 as Shepherd's Bush on its new extension to Hammersmith. It was in the Shepherd's Bush Market area just south of Uxbridge Road. From 1 October 1877 until 31 December 1906 the MR also ran direct services along this line to Richmond via . The original Shepherd's Bush station closed in 1914 to be replaced by two new stations which opened on 1 April 1914: the new Shepherd's Bush station resited a short distance north across the Uxbridge Road, and Goldhawk Road about half a kilometre to the south. Those stations remain in those locations but nothing exists of the former station buildings in the marketplace. In 1900 the Central London Railway (CLR) opened its Shepherd's Bush station, now the Central line station, at the other end of Shepherd's Bush Green. For 108 years there were two Tube stations of the same name apart. In 2008 the new London Overground Shepherd's Bush railway station was opened on the West London Line. To avoid the confusion of three stations named Shepherd's Bush, the Hammersmith & City line station was renamed Shepherd's Bush Market on 12 October 2008. The other two on the Central line and the West London line are close to each other and interchange is allowed, but not with Shepherd's Bush Market tube station. ==Locale== The station is at the western end of Shepherd's Bush Green, and stands just across the road from the marketplace which gives it its name. Stallholders have traded on the strip of land beside the Hammersmith & City line since 1914, when the market took over the station's first site. The other end of the market is served by Goldhawk Road Underground station. Shepherd's Bush Market station is the nearest Underground stop to various entertainment venues including the Bush Theatre and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.

He is the younger brother of Heavyweight boxer Elieser Castillo. ==Amateur career== From the ages of 12 through 16, he trained to box through the Cuban state government's amateur boxing program. (This is the same program that produced such boxing legends as Teofilo Stevenson, F√©lix Sav√≥n, Joel Casamayor, and Juan Carlos Gomez.) Despite winning the vast majority of his approximately 90 amateur bouts in Cuba, the young fighter could not manage to capture an international title. ==Defection from Cuba== At the age of 17, Eliseo Castillo escaped from Cuba on a raft with his brothers Elieser (a very well known fellow Heavyweight boxer) and Eliades and two other friends. The group spent five days at sea before they drifted ashore in Panama. Soon thereafter, they were returned to Guantanamo Bay. After 18 months of processing the group was allowed to emigrate to the United States. He then moved to Miami, Florida. ==Professional career== At the age of 20, he began his professional career as a boxer. His first bout was against Anthony Mack (who was also making his professional debut that evening) on February 24, 1996. Castillo won the bout via first round knockout. He fought off-and-on into the new millennium, at one time even taking 3 years off from the sport. Though his career has been spotty, he still managed to remain undefeated up until April 2005. The only blemish on his record up until that point was a draw to Terry Pitts (who later changed his name to Sajad Abdul Aziz) on November 13, 1998 at the famed Mahi Shrine Temple Auditorium in Miami. Aziz was able to score knockdowns in both the 4th and 5th rounds, but Castillo fought back and secured a majority draw. These fights were at cruiserweight. His biggest victory came on July 3, 2004 against former Heavyweight champion Michael Moorer at the American Airlines Arena in Miami. He beat the former champion by a unanimous decision in their 10-round bout. This brought him some level of attention from the boxing press and garnered for him a fight with Wladimir Klitschko the following year. At 2:51 in the fourth round, Klitschko was declared the victor after referee Daniel Van de Wiele stopped the fight. Shortly after the fight with Klitschko, Castillo moved back down to the Cruiserweight division. He has won two straight since the Klitschko loss and was KOd by, the then undefeated, Johnathon Banks on July 26, 2006. ==Professional boxing record== - align=\\"center\\" colspan=820 Wins (15 knockouts, 5 decisions), 3 Losses (3 knockouts, 0 decisions), 1 Draw -  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Result  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Record  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Opponent  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Type  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Round  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Date  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Location  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Notes -align=center Loss  align=left Denis Lebedev TKO 5 22/03/2009 align=left Balashikha, Russia align=left - Loss  align=left Johnathon Banks KO 4 26/07/2006 align=left New York City, United States align=left - Win  align=left Willie Herring UD 12 24/03/2006 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Chris \\"Bam Bam\\" Lewallen TKO 1 25/02/2006 align=left Oklahoma City, United States align=left - Loss  align=left \\"Dr. Steel Hammer\\" Wladimir Klitschko TKO 4 23/04/2005 align=left Dortmund, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany align=left - Win  align=left Michael \\"Double M\\" Moorer UD 10 03/07/2004 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Drexie James KO 1 01/05/2004 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Curtis Taylor KO 3 26/03/2004 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Onebo Maxime UD 4 16/01/2004 align=left Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States align=left - Win  align=left Ronnie \\"The Bear\\" Smith UD 4 13/10/2002 align=left Choctaw, Mississippi, United States align=left - Win  align=left Bill \\"The Italian Hammer\\" Medei TKO 1 22/06/2002 align=left Virgin Islands, United States align=left - Win  align=left Agustin Corpus TKO 5 07/08/1999 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Draw  align=left Sajad Abdul Aziz PTS 10 13/11/1998 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Tyrone Armstead TKO 5 07/06/1998 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Ed Mosley TKO 4 02/05/1998 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Jerry \\"Oil Can\\" Brown TKO 2 20/12/1997 align=left Miami, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Oscar Silva KO 1 22/08/1997 align=left Miami Beach, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Berry \\"Killa Bee\\" Butler UD 4 24/01/1997 align=left Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States align=left - Win  align=left Jesus Carlos Velez TKO 3 03/01/1997 align=left Hialeah, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left George Holder TKO 2 27/09/1996 align=left Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States align=left - Win  align=left Alphonzo Davis TKO 3 10/08/1996 align=left Las Vegas, Nevada, United States align=left - Win  align=left Aurelio Dos Santos KO 1 29/07/1996 align=left Hallandale, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Luis Yampier TKO 1 25/05/1996 align=left Miami Beach, Florida, United States align=left - Win  align=left Anthony Mack TKO 1 24/02/1996 align=left Miami Beach, Florida, United States align=left } ==See also== *List of Cubans ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Cuban male boxers Category:Sportspeople from Havana Category:Cruiserweight boxers ","title":"Eliseo Castillo"},{"id":"1297582","text":"First edition cover Storm of Steel (in German: In Stahlgewittern) is the memoir of German officer Ernst J√ºnger's experiences on the Western Front during the First World War. It was originally printed privately in 1920, making it one of the first personal accounts to be published. The book is a graphic account of trench warfare. It was largely devoid of editorialization when first published, but was heavily revised several times. ==Plot== Storm of Steel begins with J√ºnger as a private entering the line with the 73rd Hanoverian Regiment in Champagne. His first taste of combat came at Les √âparges in April 1915 where he was first wounded. After recuperating, he took an officer's course and achieved the rank of Leutnant. He rejoined his regiment on the Arras sector. In 1916, with the Battle of the Somme underway, J√ºnger's regiment moved to Combles in August for the defence of the village of Guillemont. Here J√ºnger was wounded again, and absent shortly before the final British assault which captured the village -- his platoon was annihilated. In 1917 J√ºnger saw action during the Battle of Arras in April, the Third Battle of Ypres in July and October, and the German counter-attack during the Battle of Cambrai in November. J√ºnger led a company of assault troops during the final German Spring Offensive, 21 March 1918 when he was wounded again. On 23 August he suffered his most severe wound when he was shot through the chest. In total, J√ºnger was wounded 14 times during the war, including five bullet wounds and earned Golden Wound Badge. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, House Order of Hohenzollern and was the youngest ever recipient of the Pour le M√©rite.Helmuth Kiesel, Ernst J√ºnger: Die Biographie , Siedler Verlag, 2009. ==Publication history== The first version of Storm of Steel was essentially J√ºnger's unedited diary; the original title was In Storms of Steel: from the diary of a Shock Troop Commander, Ernst J√ºnger, War Volunteer, and subsequently Lieutenant in the Rifle Regiment of Prince Albrecht of Prussia (73rd Hanoverian Regiment). Since it was first published there have been up to seven revisions of Storm of Steel, with the last being the 1978 version for J√ºnger's Collected Works. For the first revision in 1924 J√ºnger rewrote the entire book for a new publisher. The next major revision came in 1934, for which the explicit descriptions of violence were muted. This edition carried the universal dedication For the fallen. The 1924 version was translated into English by Basil Creighton as The Storm of Steel Source: Spine of original dust jacket. With an introduction by R.H. Mottram, Chatto & Windus. Retrieved 2009-9-10. in 1929 and into French in 1930. A new English translation, based on the final 1961 version, was made by Michael Hofmann in 2003 which won the 2004 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. In his introduction to his own edition, Hofmann is highly critical of Creighton's translation. == Translations == * Bajo la tormenta de acero, translation into Spanish by Julio A.

His wife, Evalyn Walsh McLean, was a prominent Washington socialite. McLean was also a thoroughbred racehorse owner, and purchaser of the Hope Diamond, which was traditionally believed to carry a curse. McLean was declared insane and died in a psychiatric hospital. ==Early life== McLean was born into a publishing fortune founded by his paternal grandfather, Washington McLean, who owned The Washington Post and The Cincinnati Enquirer. He was the only child of John Roll McLean, for whom McLean, Virginia, is named, and the former Emily Truxtun Beale, daughter of Edward F. Beale and the former Mary Edwards. Emily was a hostess and socialite who was the inspiration for the character Victoria Dare in the 1880 comic novel, Democracy: An American Novel by Henry Brooks Adams. He attended Brooks Debartolo Collegiate High School.Gerald Thompson, \\"Edward F. Beale and the American West\\", University of New Mexico Press, 1983, page 219. ==Career== In 1916, Edward inherited The Washington Post, which he owned and published until 1933. ===Thoroughbred horse racing=== In 1915, Edward McLean acquired Belmont Plantation,New York Times ‚Äì March 24, 1931 where he had built a horse stable and training track for Thoroughbreds.May 10, 1915 Involved with show horses for a number of years,New York Times - September 4, 1912 in 1917, McLean purchased 32 racehorses and hired trainer H.

Hurley.Chicago Daily Tribune ‚Äì December 2, 1931 ==Hope Diamond ownership== On January 28, 1911, in a deal made in the offices of The Washington Post, McLean purchased the Hope Diamond for US$180,000 from Pierre Cartier of Cartier Jewelers on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A clause in the sale agreement for the diamond, which was widely believed to have brought death and disaster to its owners, stated that \\"Should any fatality occur to the family of Edward B. McLean within six months, the said Hope diamond is agreed to be exchanged for jewelry of equal value\\". By March, the diamond had not been paid for in accordance with the terms in the sale agreement. Cartier hired a lawyer to sue McLean for payment. McLean responded by saying that the diamond was on loan for inspection.New York Times, March 10, 1911 On February 2, 1912 The New York Times reported, \\"Wealthy Purchasers of Famous Stone to Retain It Despite Sinister Reputation.\\"New York Times, February 2, 1912 The Mcleans purchased the diamond for $180,000. For eight years, the bad luck association of the diamond was not evident. However, some subsequent events led to further speculation of the curse. In 1997, The Washington Post referenced its former publisher, the feckless Ned McLean, as \\"more of a curse even than the diamond\\".\\"HOPE & DESPAIR: THE 'CURSE' OF THE DIAMOND\\", by Sarah Booth Conroy, September 29, 1997.

C.). The McLeans lived lavishly, and were prominent in Washington society. ===Political friends=== The McLeans were close friends of Senator and President Warren G. Harding and first lady Florence Harding.Palm Beach Post - May 11, 1932 McLean was also a friend of Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, through whom he became embroiled in the Teapot Dome scandal. McLean falsely told investigating Senator Thomas J. Walsh that he had given Fall a $100,000 loan when, in fact, Fall had illegally received money from private oil companies. When Walsh threatened to have McLean charged with perjury, McLean admitted the falsity of his claim. This admission was later characterized as \\"the first climactic sensation\\" and \\"the smoking gun\\" of the scandal. ===Divorce, mental illness, and death=== The McLean marriage ended with much publicized and bitterly contested divorce proceedings, initiated by Mrs. McLean on grounds of infidelity, in October 1931. McLean filed for divorce in a Mexican court, but his wife obtained a permanent injunction from a District of Columbia court ordering the cessation of the Mexican proceedings. Edward McLean then suddenly announced he had already married Rose Douras, a sister of Hollywood film star Marion Davies;Chicago Daily Tribune, November 15, 1931 though a marriage had not occurred. McLean immediately took up residence in Riga, Latvia, where he again filed for a divorce, which was granted on December 13, 1932. Edward McLean's increasingly erratic behavior and reckless spending led to the forced sale of The Washington Post by trustees appointed by the court. The divorce proceedings of Evalyn McLean continued in United States court but were droppedChicago Daily Tribune, November 1, 1933 following an October 31, 1933, verdict by a jury in a Maryland trial that declared Edward McLean to be legally insane and incapable of managing his affairs.

The goal of scud running is to stay clear of weather to continue flying with visual, rather than instrument, references. This practice is widely accepted to be dangerous, and has led to death in many cases from pilots flying into terrain or obstacles, such as masts and towers, normally referred to as CFIT;http://www.cbs7.com/content/news/381633451.html however, even instrument- rated pilots sometimes elect to take the risk to avoid icing or embedded thunderstorms in cloud, or in situations where the minimum instrument altitudes are too high for their aircraft. Scud running is occasionally described as \\"maintaining visual contact with the ground while avoiding physical contact with it\\" or \\"if the weather's too bad to go IFR, we'll go VFR.\\"FAA AC60-22 \\"Aeronautical Decision Making\\" A procedure under instrument flight rules (IFR), called a contact approach, is often referred to as a form of \\"legalized\\" scud running. The term gets its name from scud, which is used to describe small, ragged, low cloud fragments that are unattached to a larger cloud base, and often seen with and behind cold fronts and thunderstorm gust fronts. ==US regulations== In the United States, most controlled airspace below MSL requires a pilot flying under VFR to remain below a cloud ceiling and to maintain visibility. However, outside of airport control zones and major terminal areas, controlled airspace typically begins at above ground level; below that is uncontrolled (class G) airspace, where (at that altitude) a pilot is required only to remain clear of clouds and to maintain visibility. ==Canadian regulations== In Canada, the visibility and altitude requirements are similar to those in the U.S., but most controlled airspace outside of terminal areas bottoms out at Above Ground Level (AGL), so there is more room to scud run legally.

National Park Service website. Retrieved December 11, 2006. The park is centered on two small lakes, Green Lake and Round Lake, which have an unusual blue-green color. These lakes lie at the base of a gorge that is somewhat longer than a mile in length. The lakes and the gorge are remnants of the ice ages, and exemplify some of the unusual geology of upstate New York. Green Lake has a surface area of 65 acres and a maximum depth of 195 feet. Round Lake has a surface area of 34 acres and a maximum depth of 170 feet. The park's area is , and it logs about 800,000 visitors each year. Nearly half the park's area is old-growth forest, which includes many very large specimens of tuliptrees, sugar maples, beech, basswood, hemlocks, and white cedars. A grove of trees, lying immediately to the southwest of Round Lake, has been called the Tuliptree Cathedral. Contains links to the individual survey data. ==Camping and recreation== At its northern end, Green Lake has a sandy swimming beach, lawns for sunbathing, and a building with changing facilities and a concession stand; Green Lake is certainly one of the most popular swimming beaches in Central New York. Adjacent to the beach, there is a boathouse with rowboat and paddleboat rentals in the summer season. Currently, Green Lakes is offering stand up paddle board classes, excursions, and yoga taught by Method 360; privately owned boats and paddle boards are not permitted. The park has an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones, as well as a clubhouse in its southeastern quadrant. Above the western cliffs along Green Lake there are a Frisbee golf course, 137 campsites, and seven cabins for those who prefer a less rustic experience. There are several formal picnic areas throughout the park, including some with picnic shelters that can be reserved for groups. There is an extensive network of hiking trails throughout the park, including about of cross-country ski trails. Some of the trails are also available for mountain biking. The development of the lake area is mostly contained at its northern end. The western shoreline of Green Lake is undeveloped, and Round Lake itself is essentially in wilderness. Of this region, Mary Notarthomas has written that \\"When walking on the lake trails, one is cradled between the rich, vibrant, almost alien blue-green waters on one side and thickly vegetated, steep wooded inclines on the other.\\" Together, North Lake Trail and Round Lake Trail make a level loop of . The park includes many bike trails, most of which are at the western edge of the park. These connect with the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park, which runs by the north entrance to Green Lakes State Park (just above the top of the aerial photograph). The Erie Canal, which was abandoned in 1918, is still continuous within this State Historic Park, and the old towpath is now a walking and bicycling path. The Park extends from the Butternut Creek aqueduct in DeWitt to the Erie Canal Village, which is near Rome. The golf course at Green Lakes State Park was designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1935. ==Golf course== Green Lakes State Park has an 18-hole public golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1935. The course was one of Trent Jones' earliest; ultimately, he was credited with designing about 500 courses. In lieu of payment for its design, he was given a ten-year lease for $1.00/year. Jones opened the course on May 6, 1936. He'd invited Gene Sarazen to play an exhibition match with Emmett Kelly, the first course pro; more than 1,000 people came to watch. The link to the article also leads to a video interview with Rocky Kelly, the long-time head pro of the course. James Dodson has written of the course that \\"the original little masterpiece at Green Lakes, where Wendy and I and sometimes the other Dewsweepers slipped away to chase the game among the gloriously mature evergreens and admire the long view over a dark blue glacial lake, to the very foothills of the Adirondacks themselves, remained just about my favorite Trent Jones golf course of all.\\" Trent Jones attended the 50th anniversary of the opening of the course in 1986. ==History and planning== The movement to acquire the land around Green Lakes for a state park began around 1924. The history has been described in a memoir by Betsy Knapp.. Knapp, a descendant of the family that acquired and farmed this area in the early 19th century, noted the particular role of Harry Francis, then a professor at the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University (now the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry). In October 1927 were purchased for the new park. In 1929, the Administration Building was built according to plans by Laurie D. Cox, a prominent landscape architect (and Hall of Fame lacrosse coach) who was active in the design of several New York state parks. The first superintendent of the park, Arvin Henry Almquist, lived there for four years. The building, which had been boarded up for many years, was re-opened in 2008. Green Lakes was a worksite for Civilian Conservation Corps project SP-12 and for companies 1203 and 2211 (veterans). The photograph records the construction of the camp barracks around 1934. After US entry into World War II in 1941, the barracks were used to house German prisoners. During the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1939), the New York State Department of Conservation (under the administration of then- governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and later the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) constructed the park's roads, buildings, cabins, golf course and trails. CCC camps for project SP-12 were created on the property of the park. CCC company 1203, and subsequently 2211 (a company of veterans of the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War), were assigned to the project. These men hauled loads of sand from Sylvan Beach (on nearby Oneida Lake) to create a sandy beach; they dug the basements of the park buildings by hand. The CCC also constructed barracks, dining halls, etc. for its own use. These facilities were closed in 1941. A reunion of the CCC companies who had worked in Central New York was held at Green Lakes in 1988. The CCC camp was reopened in 1944 during World War II to house wartime farm workers from Newfoundland. In 1945 it became the Fayetteville Camp for German prisoners of war. Fayetteville Camp was a branch of Pine Camp, which was located on the site of the present Fort Drum near Watertown, New York. The camp was closed again in 1946 when the prisoners were repatriated to Germany. Kirkpatrick has published her work on prisoner-of-war camps in Interpretive sign at the Bird Conservation Area within Green Lakes State Park Since the original purchase of land in 1928, the park has increased to . There were additional acquisitions of land in 1960, Petty indicates that the 1960 acquisition was by eminent domain from its owners Howard and Robert Cross. 1975, Parts of the \\"Amos tract\\" were purchased at the southwest border of the park, and in the immediate watershed leading to Round Lake. 1995, Ms. Betsy Knapp left a bequest to the park of 17 rolling acres at its southern edge, between the Signal Hill and Golden Acres neighborhoods of Fayetteville. The parcel consists of land that Knapp's great-great-grandfather David Collin III began farming in 1817, and incorporates a rare outcropping of dolomite known as Indian Oven Hill. The State of New York paid $2.16M to purchase at the western boundary from William Camperlino. and 1996. The State of New York purchased land along the northern side of the park from the estate of the Teske family. Plans to add an additional to the park have apparently been frustrated. 261 additional acres were acquired in 2019. Alverna Heights, a 200-acre retreat adjoining the park, was purchased from the Sisters of St. Francis by New York State on December 6, 2019. Two houses occupied by the Sisters have been leased back to them for a decade. The Sisters of St. Francis have owned Alverna Heights since 1964. See In 2008, the bathhouse near the park's swimming area and beach was demolished, and a new building was constructed to replace it at a cost of about $2.3 million. The building incorporates changing facilities, restrooms and showers, a snack concession, and a meeting room.

Links to the figures and appendices are at The Executive Summary of the Plan notes: * 1002 acres in the western half of the park is designated as a Bird Conservation Area. * Approximately 105 acres in the Old Growth area within the National Natural Landmark, and the area surrounding Round Lake, is designated as a Park Preservation Area * Improve the Rolling Hills Campground in the short term. In the long term the campground will be relocated to an area south of the park office. While the large white-tail deer population in the park is a problem, bow hunting is excluded; some local groups have called for bow-hunting of deer in the park as a partial solution. A submerged reef at Deadman's Point; the reef built up over the years from the annual \\"whiting\\" events in Green Lake, during which calcium carbonate precipitates out of the lake's waters. ==Geology and limnology== ===Origin of the gorge=== The cliffs surrounding Round Lake are about high, but the rocky gorge in which the lake lies is much deeper than this. The bottom of Round Lake is about below its surface. Round Lake's bottom lies in sediments which may be another deep. There is thus nearly gouged out of the bedrock here. This deep gorge was formed towards the end of the last ice age, about 15,000 years ago, by an enormous river of water. The river originated in the melting, retreating ice sheet, and it flowed east through this channel on its way to the sea. The Niagara River gorge lying below Niagara Falls is an active example of this type of gorge formation; its depth is about , which is somewhat shallower than that at Green Lakes. There are several other similar gorges in the same region as Green Lakes State Park, in particular at Clark Reservation, at Smoky Hollow ( south of Clark Reservation), and at Pumpkin Hollow (about west of Clark Reservation). Geologists call these gorges and hollows \\"the Syracuse channels.\\" Visualization looking across the Syracuse channels from the northeast. A view from Green Lakes Beach Deadman's Point at Green Lake. \\"Marl reef\\", bacteria formed chalky shoreline formations, are visible in the foreground. ===Origin of the lakes=== Green Lake and Round Lake are probably the remnants of the \\"plunge pools\\" of enormous waterfalls that existed during this era. However, the presence of two distinct lakes is not fully understood. As expected for plunge pools, the lakes are fairly deep in comparison to their area. For example, Round Lake is deep, and has a diameter of about . ===The color of the lakes=== Nearly half of the water that enters the lakes comes directly through the bedrock in which the lakes are embedded.Takahashi, T., Broecker, W., Li, Y. H., and Thurber, D. (1968). \\"Chemical and isotopic balances for a meromictic lake,\\" Limnol. and Ocean. 13, pp. 272-292 (as discussed in Hilfinger and Mullins). This water contains a heavy load of dissolved minerals that are not present in water that enters through the surface from rain and snow. The high concentration of sulfur in the deep waters had already been reported by 1849; the lakes' waters also have a high concentration of calcium and magnesium. This mineral concentration leads to \\"whiting\\" events each year in which small crystallites of calcite and other minerals precipitate from the water. At these times of year the lakes appear particularly green, and the small crystallites are deposited in a layer underneath the lakes' waters.Thompson, J.B., Schultze-Lam, S., Beveridge, T.J., Des Marais, D.J. (1997). \\"Whiting events: Biogenic origin due to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacterial picoplankton,\\" Limnology and Oceanography 42(1), 133-141. The notable shoreline \\"reef\\" at Deadman's Point (see photo) on Green Lake was built up by this precipitation over thousands of years. Underneath Deadman's Point there are some extremely rare aquatic mosses and sponges. ===Climate history and Green Lakes=== Nearly all lakes undergo mixing of their deepest waters with their surface waters at least once a year. This mixing does not occur for Green Lake and Round Lake. They are rare, meromictic lakes. Waters deeper than about 55 feet (18 m) do not mix with the surface waters; as a consequence, they are essentially devoid of oxygen, and are rich in calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. The meromictic character of the lakes is due both to their relative depth compared to their area, and to the influx of mineral rich ground waters. Because of this lack of physical mixing, as well as the absence of growing plants or crawling animals in their oxygen- depleted depths, the deep bottoms of the lakes have relatively undisturbed annual layers of sediment (or varves) that preserve a historical record, somewhat like tree rings do. These varves are being used to study the climate of this area of New York over the last several thousand years. == References == ==External links== *New York State Parks: Green Lakes State Park, official State of New York website for the park with contact and camping reservation information. *Green Lakes State Park Golf Course webpage with contact information, times and fees. * *\\"The Underwater World of Green Lakes\\", video obtained using a robotic submarine by Dr. Mark A.

Generally, the functional hierarchy can more or less correspond to the hierarchy of roads by their owner or administrator. The related concept of access management aims to provide access to land development, while ensuring traffic flows freely and safely on surrounding roads. == United States and Canada == { class=\\"mw-collapsible floatright\\" +Vehicle miles traveled in USA - !VMT Rural !VMT Urban -   - -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Source RITA DOT } === Freeways === At the top of the hierarchy are limited access roads Freeways or Expressways, including most toll roads. These roads provide largely uninterrupted travel, often using partial or full access control, and are designed for high speeds. Some freeways have collector/distributor lanes (also known as local lanes) which further reduce the number of access ramps that directly interface with the freeway; rather, the freeway periodically interfaces with these parallel roadways, which themselves have multiple on and off-ramps. These allow the freeway to operate with less friction at an even higher speed and with higher flow. Often freeways are included in the next category, arterials. === Arterials === Arterials are major through roads that are expected to carry large volumes of traffic. Arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials, and rural and urban arterials. In some places there are large divided roads with few or no driveways that cannot be called freeways because they have occasional at- grade intersections with traffic lights that stop traffic (expressways in California, dual carriageways in Britain) or they are just too short (superarterials in Nevada). Such roads are usually classified as arterials. Frontage roads are often used to reduce the conflict between the high-speed nature of an arterial and property access concerns. ===Collectors=== Collectors (not to be confused with collector lanes, which reduce weaving on freeways), collect traffic from local roads, and distribute it to arterials. Traffic using a collector is usually going to or coming from somewhere nearby. ===Local roads=== At the bottom of the hierarchy are local streets and roads. These roads have the lowest speed limit, and carry low volumes of traffic. In some areas, these roads may be unpaved. == Europe == Most of Europe Has a legal system based on European and international treaties which define at European/international level three types of road: motorways, express roads, and other roads. This vision comes from the 20th century and is limited to traffic code and legal issues. Each nation has its own Hierarchy of roads, although there is also a European road numbering at European level, for European roads. Most of Europe has adopted Motorways (Autoroutes/Autobahnen/Autopistas/Autostrade), usually similar to those in France and the UK. The idea was originally developed in Germany, where all motorways are toll-free, and has spread widely. All major through routes in the EU and neighbouring countries have a European E-Road number in addition, or in the case of some countries' motorways, instead of a national number. In the UK these numbers are not displayed. Otherwise, most other European countries have some form of differentiating between national routes, regional and inter-regional roads and other local routes. ===United Kingdom === ====Motorway==== Motorways, similar to freeways, these high-speed roads are designated with an M prefix or (M) suffix. e.g. M1, A1(M). The speed limit is generally and there is a hard shoulder, an often slightly narrower lane next to lane 1, which is usually only to be used in cases of an emergency. Emergency telephones are located every mile along the route so motorists with broken-down vehicles can contact the authorities, although this is increasingly being done using mobile phones. Signs are blue with white text for both destinations and motorway numbers. In general, junctions are given numbers which are displayed prominently, sometimes with a letter suffix, in a small black box on all the signs for any given junction. Junctions are generally signed one mile before they exit, with three or four further signs as the junction is reached, although on busy urban stretches this first warning can reduce to about ‚Öìmile. Cyclists, pedestrians, mopeds, very slow vehicles and certain other traffic are banned. ====Primary A-road==== Green on maps and signs. A main recommended route these can be single track as in North West Sutherland or more usually single carriageway or dual carriageway. The primary road network is fully connected, meaning you can reach any part from any other without leaving the network. Some of the major dual carriageway primary routes have numbered junctions or hard shoulders in the style of the Continental semi-motorways. Many Primary Routes are largely or wholly subject to clearway restrictions, and in major cities they may be classed as red routes. Emergency telephones, if present at all, are usually infrequent - there may be some additional telephones operated by the UK's two main motoring organisations, the RAC and the AA, but these are becoming rarer. ====Non- primary A-road==== Often exists where the route is important but there is a nearby primary route (A or motorway) which duplicates this road's function. Shown as red on maps, and has white signage with black lettering. Some non- Primary A-class roads are partially subject to clearway restrictions. ====B road==== Regional in nature and used to connect areas of lesser importance. Usually shown as brown or yellow on maps and have the same white signs as non- Primary A-Class routes. If the route is primary, like the B6261, then it will be shown the same as a Primary A-Class route. ====C road==== C roads are used as local authority designations for routes within their area for administrative purposes. These routes are not shown on road maps, but have occasionally been known to appear on road signs. ====Unclassified==== Unclassified roads are local roads with no defined destination. Local destinations may, however, be signed along them. === France === In France, one hierarchy of road is based on the owner who manages the road. Independently of that, roads can have various specificities such as speed or crossings. ====Autoroutes==== Along with the rest of Europe, France has Motorways or Autoroutes similar to the British network. Unlike in the UK, the network is mostly accessible on payment of a toll, which is usually distance-dependent; there are generally more Toll (p√©age) Motorways in the South of France. However, sections passing through or close to major towns and cities are usually free. As in the UK, destinations reached via a motorway are shown with white text on a blue background. Junctions are usually numbered, the numbers being shown on signs in a small oval in the corner of the sign. ====Route Nationale==== Before the construction of Autoroutes, the Routes Nationales were the highest classification of road. They are denoted by a route number beginning N, or occasionally, RN. Going back to a Napoleonic road classification system, these are main roads comparable with British Primary Routes. They are maintained directly by the state and are usually the shortest route between major centres. Many N-Class roads are dual carriageway for some or all of their length, with a few also being given the designation of semi- motorway, where junctions are grade-separated and there is a central reservation with crash barrier. The hard shoulder, or bande d'arr√™t d'urgence, is often narrower than on full motorways and there are fewer emergency telephones. ====Routes D√©partementales==== France (including overseas territory) is split into 100 departments, the second-highest tier of local government, similar to a UK county or US state. The departments have responsibility for all roads beginning with a letter D, or occasionally RD. These roads vary in quality, from newly built local dual carriageways and downgraded Routes Nationales to winding roads that are barely wide enough for traffic to pass. Generally, they are quieter than the Routes Nationales, and of a reasonable standard. ====Routes Communales==== In general, each settlement in France is a Commune - akin to a British Civil Parish. This most local level of government is responsible for maintaining all the local roads, which are numbered with a letter C prefix. Except in major towns and cities, where their numbers are usually not marked on signs, they are usually single- track and may be in a state of poor repair due to the large number of roads covered by populations as small as 10. === Hungary === Hungarian road categories are as follows: * Gyorsforgalmi √∫t (controlled-access highway): **Aut√≥p√°lya (motorway): at least 2+2 travel lanes and 1+1 emergency lane, central reservation, no at-grade intersections, speed limit: 130 km/h **Aut√≥√∫t (expressway): 1+1 or more travel lanes, optionally emergency lanes and central reservation, some at-grade intersections(only if 1+1 lanes), speed limit: 110 km/h *F≈ë√∫t (arterial road or main road) (with one digit in their name, e.g.: 6-os √∫t) *Megyei √∫t (county road) (with two digits, e.g.: 16-os √∫t) *Helyi √∫t (local road) (with three or more digits) etc. === Czech Republic and Slovakia === The current categorization in the Czech Republic and Slovakia originates from the Czechoslovak 1961 road act. * D√°lnice (freeways, commonly translated as highways) ‚Äì numbered by 1-digit or 2-digit numbers, distinguished by red color of the number plates or by the letter D (D0, D11 etc.). D√°lnice are owned by the state (by the republic). * Silnice (roads) ** 1st class roads ‚Äì they are numbered by 1-digit or 2-digit numbers, distinguished by blue color of the number plates or by the Roman numeral of the class before the number (I/4, I/101). Some of first-class roads or their sections are signed as expressways (motorways) and have similar traffic rules as freeways. 1st class roads are owned by the state (by the republic) and traditionally called \\"state roads\\". ** 2nd class roads are numbered by 3-digit numbers and signed by blue color of the number plates, possibly supplemented by the Roman numeral of the class before the number (II/101, II/613). 2nd class roads are owned by self- governing regions and traditionally called \\"regional roads\\". In Slovak cities of Bratislava and Ko≈°ice, the sections are owned and managed by the cities. In the Czech capital of Prague, only several marginal sections are classified as 2nd class roads. ** 3rd class roads are numbered by 4-digit or 5-digit numbers in the Czech Republic. Slovakia used 5-digit or 6-digit numbers until 1st May 2015 when it was replaced by new 4-digit numbering. The old Czechoslovak numbers of 3-class roads are derived from the number of closest road of higher class. The new Slovak numbering express belonging to a district. In the Czech Republic, 3rd class roads (traditionally called \\"district roads) are owned by regions, as the district administration was cancelled since 2003. The City of Prague (which has the status of region as well as municipality) has no 3rd class roads. In Slovakia, 3rd class roads are owned by self-governing regions (excluding the cities of Bratislava and Ko≈°ice). In the Czech Republic,the numbers of 3rd class roads are not marked on signs nor in common maps. They are available on special maps only, and are used for administrative and maintenance purposes only. * M√≠stn√≠ komunikace (local communications) are owned and managed by municipalities (all towns and cities have also status of municipalities). According to the Road Act and its implementing regulations, they should be numbered by local numbering, but such a numbering is not available to the public and really not required by the state. In reality, only street names are used for identification. Technically, local communications are distinguished to 4 classes similar to classes of roads (the 4st class are pedestrian or cyclist zones or paths), but the classification is used only in very specialized administration maps. statutory cities can delegate administration of low-class streets or administration of sidewalks to self- governing boroughs. * √öƒçelov√° komunikace (utilitarian communication) can be owned by any subject, private as well as public. Such communications are often subject of litigations because the legal status is a bit inconsistent and unclear. ** ve≈ôejnƒõ p≈ô√≠stupn√° (open to the public) has similar traffic mode as municipal communications; generally, forest roads and field roads are count among \\"utilitarian/purpose communications\\". However, motor vehicles are prohibited at the forest roads by the Forest Act. The national law doesn't concern over compensations or subventions to the owner, and the duty of maintenance is questionable and not stated explicitly by the law. ** uzav≈ôen√° (closed) is a communication in enclosed object or facility; outside of them, the owner needs an administrative decision to exclude or restrict the public traffic. Traffic rules applies to such communications, but the owner can permit exceptions. Until 1938, separate lands of Czechoslovakia have different laws and road systems, inherited from the Austro-Hungarian period. Just in 1938, a unified Czechoslovak road act passed. In 1935, there existed Czechoslovak state roads (not distinguished by class) and several types of non-state public roads: * in Bohemia, silnice zemsk√© (land roads), silnice okresn√≠ (district roads), silnice a cesty obecn√≠ (municipal roads and ways) (there was only one remained 23km land road in Bohemia, connecting Jilemnice, Vysok√© nad Jizerou and Rokytnice nad Jizerou) * in Moravia, silnice okresn√≠ (district roads) of 1st and 2nd class, silnice a cesty obecn√≠ (municipal roads and ways) * in Czech Silesia, silnice okresn√≠ (district roads) of 1st and 2nd class, silnice a cesty obecn√≠ (municipal roads and ways) and ve≈ôejn√© cesty interesent≈Ø (public ways of interesents) * in Slovakia and Zakarpattia, zemsk√© cesty (land roads, formerly ≈æupn√© cesty, ≈æupa roads), pr√≠jezdn√© cesty (access roads), vicin√°ln√≠ cesty (vicinal roads), cesty obecn√© (municipal roads and ways) and cesty interesent≈Ø (ways of interesents). Thus, in the Moravian- Silesian Land existed no land roads, in Slovakia and Zakarpattia were no district roads but existed a special class of \\"access roads\\", and in Bohemian and Moravia existed not a status of \\"public ways of interesents\\".Vl√°dn√≠ n√°vrh z√°kona o ve≈ôejn√Ωch silnic√≠ch a ve≈ôejn√Ωch cest√°ch a o silniƒçn√≠ a cestn√≠ policii (silniƒçn√≠ z√°kon), governmental proposal of the Road Act, 1935, reasoning report Historically, local communications is a successor term for the former obecn√≠ silnice (municipal roads) and obecn√≠ cesty (municipal ways). The terms \\"utilitarian communications\\" replaced the former term cesty interesent≈Ø or z√°jemnick√© cesty (ways of interesents) since 1961. However, in Bohemia and Moravia, public way on a private plot was concepted as a municipal way before the 1961 reform, and maintained by the municipality. P≈ô√≠jezdn√≠ komunikace (access communications) to the railway stations were a special class of roads before 1938 in Slovakia nad Zakarpattia. Since 1938, acces communications to railway stations, airports and ports should be built as municipal roads or district roads, as was the previous praxis in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Paradoxically, the today's main access road to the main Prague airport (V√°clav Havel International Airport in Prague-Ruzynƒõ) is a private property of the airport and has a status of an \\"utilitarian communication\\". Czechoslovak act no. 147/1949 Sb. nationalized all previous st√°tn√≠ (state), zemsk√© (land), and okresn√≠ (district) roads and authorized the government to list other individual roads (vicinal, municipal and others) to be nationalized) or negotiate a transfer of redundant state roads to administration by municipalities. The Czechoslovak act no. 135/1961 Sb. stated a terminology and classification which is in essence continued in today's Czech Republic and Slovakia. === Poland === Polish road categories are as follows: * National roads (Drogi krajowe) ‚Äì trunk roads, international E-road (motorways and express roads) * Voivodeship road (Drogi wojew√≥dzkie) ‚Äì regional roads * County roads (Drogi powiatowe) * Communal roads (Drogi gminne) ‚Äì communal/municipal roads === Romania === In Romania the roads are classified as: * AutostrƒÉzi (A) - Motorways * Drumuri na»õionale »ôi europene (DN, E) - National and European roads * Drumuri na»õionale (DN) - National roads * Drumuri jude»õene (DJ) - County roads * Drumuri comunale (DC) - Communal roads === Cyprus === In Cyprus the roads are classified as: * A: The motorways of Cyprus (ŒëœÖœÑŒøŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒ∑œÑœåŒ¥œÅŒøŒºŒøœÇ) are mainly 2 lanes on each side but some areas in Nicosia and Limassol have 3 lanes on each side * B: The trunk-roads of Cyprus. These are mainly the old roads the motorways have replaces but not all of them are. These link towns together and also include some ring-roads. Most of these are single-carriageway 2 lane roads but a few of them are 4 lane dual- carriageway. * E: These are main roads which go through multiple villages and small towns and are built similarly to B roads. A few of them can also be 4 lane dual-carriageways. * F: The small village roads which normally only serve 1 or a few villages. These can be 2 lane roads but also a few of them are 1 lane but wide enough for 2 cars to pass * Unclassified: The broadest type of classifications. These can be dirt-roads leading to farms and can also be dual-carriageways. The majority of them are 1 or 2 lane roads in towns or villages. ==See also== *Street hierarchy ==External links== *FHWA - Functional Classification Category:Road transport Category:Types of roads ","title":"Hierarchy of roads"},{"id":"1297634","text":"The Courier-Post is a morning daily newspaper that serves South Jersey in the Delaware Valley.

He was the only Tutsi member of the transitional government. On February 17, 1994, UNAMIR commander Rom√©o Dallaire received information of a plot to assassinate Ndasingwa and Joseph Kavaruganda, both prominent moderate members of the transitional government.

He was one of the advocates of the conspiracy theory that HIV was created by the United States government at Fort Detrick, Maryland. After the fall of the Soviet Union, KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin and two former members of East Germany's secret police revealed that Segal was a Soviet disinformation agent who worked for the KGB. ==Early life and education== Tombstone of Jakob and Lilli Segal at Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde, Berlin Segal was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, into a Lithuanian Jewish family, the son of Hermann Segal, a merchant from Kaunas (1880‚Äì1941), and Rebekka (n√©e Schlimakowski; 1887‚Äì1941). He had an older brother, Moshe, an electrician. When he was 8, his family moved to K√∂nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He was educated in Berlin and Munich, where he joined the Red Students' League (Roter Studentenbund) and the Communist Party of Germany. In 1933, he immigrated to France, where he furthered his studies in Toulouse before earning a doctorate in physiology from the Sorbonne in 1936. During the Second World War, he and his German wife, Lilli (n√©e Schlesinger, whom he had met at university in Toulouse) joined the resistance as part of the Main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e and went underground. All of his family, including his parents and brother, were killed in the Holocaust. Lilli was arrested in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz in July 1944, but was sent to a work camp and survived by escaping that November. In 1946, he joined the Centre national de la recherche scientifique. Following the Soviet annexation of Lithuania during the war, Segal and wife accepted Soviet citizenship. In the early 1950s, he moved to East Germany, reportedly on the recommendation of Soviet officials, becoming informeller Mitarbeiter. In 1952, he became a biology professor at Humboldt University in East Berlin, and in 1953 founded its Institute for Applied Bacteriology. From 1967‚Äì70, he worked at the National Center for Scientific Research in Havana, Cuba. He moved to Mexico City, where he retired in the early 1970s before returning to East Berlin. ==Operation Infektion== Segal was recruited out of retirement by the KGB for Operation INFEKTION, a disinformation campaign designed to spread the belief that HIV/AIDS was created by the United States Government. According to U.S. intelligence historian Thomas Boghardt, Segal possibly suspected it was a Soviet campaign when approached by the Stasi (MfS): Segal, together with his wife and Ronald Dehmlow, a fellow retired professor from Humboldt, published a 47-page pamphlet titled AIDS‚ÄîIts Nature and Origin, in which they speculated that AIDS was the creation of the U.S. government, which had first tested it on gay prison inmates. What became known as the \\"Segal Report\\" was distributed by the Stasi and KGB at the Eighth Conference of Non-Aligned Nations, held 1‚Äì6 September 1986 in Harare, Zimbabwe, which was attended by representatives of more than 100 Third World countries. It produced the desired effect at the conference, and its claims were reprinted in the press in more than 25 countries in Africa. One of Segal's claims was that Prof. Robert Gallo crossed the Visna sheep virus with the Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV I) in 1978 in the P4 laboratory of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick. Proponents of this theory claim that 90% of HIV RNA is found in Visna and 10% in HTLV I. Genomic analysis, however, shows that such claims are false. Research after Segal's theory shows that HIV is much more closely related to the simian immunodeficiency virus than to any other virus. ==HIV therapy hypothesis== Segal suggested an HIV therapy of anti- inflammatory aspirin or ultraviolet radiation of the patient's blood in order to reduce the metabolic activity of macrophages, which are host cells for HIV. He also supported the idea of a p24- vaccine without gp120 which was patented by Jonas Salk as \\"Remune\\". ==Works== *Jakob Segal/Lilli Segal: Aids - die Spur f√ºhrt ins Pentagon zusammen mit Manuel Kiper, Biokrieg, Vg.

The station's livery is firebrick red but brown on the Tsuen Wan Line platforms. The station is the southern terminus of the Tsuen Wan Line, a stop on the Island Line, and connects to Hong Kong Station, which serves the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express. The station was originally named Chater Station. It was initially conceived to cater for 330,000 passengers daily and was planned to be long ‚Äì one of the longest stations in the world. More than 200,000 passengers use this station daily. The longest distance between two exits is approximately 700m. ==History== ===Early plans=== Central station was included in the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study, a system proposed in September 1967.Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith & Associates (1967), Hong Kong Mass Transport Study. Together with Western Market station, it was to serve as an interchange station of the Kwun Tong Line and Island Line. In the recommended system, the Tsuen Wan Line would end at Admiralty. The station was originally planned to be located under Des Voeux Road Central between Jubilee Street and Pedder Street. In 1970, in the Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies, the station was proposed as two separate but connected stations: Chater Station () under Chater Road and Pedder Station () under Pedder Street), which would serve the Kong Kow Line (now Tsuen Wan Line) and Island Line respectively. ===Modified Initial System and opening=== The station first opened as Chater Station on 12 February 1980 as the terminus of the Modified Initial System (MIS, now Kwun Tong Line). Only a portion of the station came into operation as the Island Line had not been opened yet. The station was named Chater in English but ‰∏≠Áí∞ (Central) in Chinese. This would be misleading as many thought that the Chinese name would be ÈÅÆÊâì, a transliteration. When the Island Line between Admiralty and Chai Wan opened on 31 May 1985, MTR renamed Chater to Central together with the renaming of some other stations on the Tsuen Wan line. Construction for the Island Line was carried out in early 1983 and connected the new platforms with the original structure. The Island Line began servicing Central on 23 May 1986 when it was extended beyond Admiralty to Sheung Wan and the Island Line platforms came into service. ===Passageway to Hong Kong Station=== One component of the Airport Core Programmewww.info.gov.hk/napco/index-e.html between 1991 and 1998 was a railway connecting the new Hong Kong International Airport to the city centre. To link Central with the nearby Hong Kong Station, the southern terminus of the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express, a passageway was built under Connaught Road to connect the two stations. The passageway starts at the Pedder Street concourse and was refurbished with a design similar to that of Hong Kong Station. ==Station layout== Central Station has four platforms on three levels. The top level includes platform 3 and is built beneath Des Voeux Road Central at the intersection of Pedder Street, stretching from World-Wide House to Alexandra House, on the northern side of the road. The platform serves Chai Wan-bound trains on the Island Line and this level includes the connecting walkway to Hong Kong Station. The middle level includes platforms 1 and 2 using a shared island. They serve the Tsuen Wan Line and were built directly under Chater Road, extending from Des Voeux Road Central to Club Street. The bottom level, two levels from the top level, is platform 4, for Island Line trains in the direction of Kennedy Town. Passengers from platform 3 transferring to platforms 1 or 2 use the regular escalators on the Chater Road concourse. There are designated escalators from platforms 1 and 2 to platform 4 for the sole purpose of transfer. The Tsuen Wan Line platforms are straight and were built by cut-and-cover. Most of the length of the Island Line platforms is the same, although the eastern part (towards Admiralty Station) is curved and the gap is large, as they are located in sections of bored tunnels and have the curved walls typical of most other stations on the Island Line. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;width:50px;\\" G  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:100px;\\" Street level  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:380px;\\" Exits -  style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" P  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Chater Road concourse  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" ‚Äì -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" L1  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" Pedder Street concourse  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Customer Service, MTRShops Hang Seng Bank, vending machines Octopus promotion machine -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical- align:top;\\" Chater Road concourse  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Customer Service, MTRShops ATM -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" L2  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" Chater Road concourse  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Customer Service, MTRShops Hang Seng Bank, vending machines -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" Pedder Street concourse  style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Customer Service, MTRShops Subway to Hong Kong Station for & Octopus promotion machine, i-centre internet service -  style=\\"border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Side platform, doors will open on the left -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Platform 3  style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"  towards Chai Wan (Admiralty) ‚Üí -  style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" L3 Platform 1  towards Tsuen Wan (Admiralty) ‚Üí -  style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Island platform, doors will open on the left or right -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Platform 2  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"  towards Tsuen Wan (Admiralty) ‚Üí -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" L4  style=\\"border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Side platform, doors will open on the right -  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" Platform 4  style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" ‚Üê towards Kennedy Town (Sheung Wan) } ==Entrances and Exits== Central Station stretches underneath Chater Road from Statue Square in the east and underneath Des Voeux Road to Li Yuen Street East in the west.

The male quartet originated in the United Kingdom in December 2003, bringing together singers Urs B√ºhler (Switzerland), Carlos Mar√≠n (Spain), David Miller (USA), and S√©bastien Izambard (France). The group was created and promoted by music producer Simon Cowell for the label Syco Music (a subsidiary of Sony Music).

David and Urs are tenors, along with the baritone Carlos, they have long careers in the world of opera and classical music start from early vocal training. In contrast, S√©bastien has not had any prior professional musical training (was self-taught), and is a tenor voice which the group classes as vox populi due to his pop tone. Piano keyboard indicating the typical tenor. Piano keyboard indicating the typical baritone. * Urs, Tenor, most likely a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach features in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice might or might not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes.Tenor#Heldentenor This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: the extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5. * S√©bastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, so it has a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of this voice type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training. S√©bastien's voice is distinguished by its clear and bright timbre, the pectoral resonance and firmness in voice projection. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to B4. * Carlos, Verdi baritone. Incorporating the deep tones that a bass has, while having an upper range approaching that of a tenor, Carlos' voice type is high even for a usual baritone. A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range, up to A4, sometimes even up to the B‚ô≠4.Baritone#Verdi The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G‚ô≠2 up to B‚ô≠4. The *unofficial* sheet music for their first album claims he sings down to a D2, however this is atypical of a baritone. Most basses would not even be required to sing such notes. During the Live at The Greek Theatre concert, he hit B4 singing I Believe in You. * David, lyric tenor. The lyric tenor is a warm graceful voice with a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy and can be heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5).Tenor#Lyric The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from C3 up to E5. A very quick, falsettoed F5 can be heard on their first album in the song Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui. ===Styling=== Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their flawless, refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by Giorgio Armani;Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni, and costumes and accessories: William Hunt, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Tom Ford and Gucci. ===Musical style=== Creating Il Divo created a revolution within the pure genre of opera because their musical combination of opera singing and classical music (opera), with themes of different genres, including Latin, folk, ballads, church music, bolero and pop. But his lyrical voices kept playing emblematic songs, it is not synonymous with opera, nor pop. There is talk of an intermediate term, but not of a merger between the two, since such lines that can not be merged, as David describes himself: So we talk about a new invention of musical style, hand own quartet, called Opera-Pop o P√≥pera, classified in the genre of contemporary music- ===Multilingual=== The quartet records their songs in several languages Spanish (\\"Regresa A Mi\\", \\"Hasta Mi Final\\", \\"La Vida Sin Amor\\"), English (\\"Mama\\", \\"Amazing Grace\\", \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\"), Italian (\\"Senza Parole\\", \\"Passera\\", \\"Notte Di Luce\\"), French (\\"Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,\\" \\"Le Temps des Cathedrales\\"), one in Latin (\\"Panis Angelicus\\") and a few in Portuguese(\\"Volta Pra Mim\\") and Japanese (\\"Furusato\\"). Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song: \\"The Man You Love\\" (Spanish & English), \\"Ave Maria\\" (Italian & Latin), \\"I Believe In You\\" (English & French) are recorded this way; whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: \\"She\\" (Italian & English) and \\"Bring Him Home\\" (English & Spanish). Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as they themselves say that \\"Spanish is the language of Romanticism\\". ==Other activities== ===Philanthropy=== On 25 April 2007, Il Divo performed on American Idol in one of the \\"Idol Gives Back\\" episodes, which raised money for children in the US and Africa. For every vote cast during that show, Idol sponsors Coca-Cola, AT&T;, and others donated money to Charity Projects Entertainment Fund (CPEF) and other groups such as Save the Children and America's Second Harvest. In 2011, they recorded the carol \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" to raise money for the organisation Save the Children. Il Divo is related indirectly in terms of sponsorship and help with the French NGO SMTA Assistance M√©dicale Toit du Monde since 2005, of which S√©bastien is the international official sponsor, and with Sanfilippo Children's Foundation in which S√©bastien's global ambassador. 20‚Äì30 September 2015, David Miller and Urs B√ºhler rode on motorbikes all in the name of charity. We are planning to ride across America on a 2800-mile journey from Miami to LA to raise funds for the brilliant Nordoff Robbins music therapy charity. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Il Divo (2004) * Ancora (2006) * Siempre (2006) * The Promise (2008) * Wicked Game (2011) * A Musical Affair (2013) * Amor & Pasi√≥n (2015) * Timeless (2018) ==Videography== ==See also== * Il Divo videography * Il Divo discography ==References== ==Bibliography== *Allegra Rossi, Romancing The World, Hardback 128 pages, 10 November 2005, Orion publishers () *Il Divo, Our Music, Our Journey, Our Words, Paperback 192 pages, 6 September 2007, Headline Book Publishing () ==External links== * IlDivo.com Official Website Il Divo Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Opera crossover singers Category:Musical quartets Category:Sony BMG artists Category:Vocal quartets Category:Ballad music groups ","title":"Il Divo"},{"id":"1297743","text":"The National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (Mouvement r√©publicain national pour la d√©mocratie et le d√©veloppement) was the ruling political party of Rwanda from 1975 to 1994 under President Juv√©nal Habyarimana. Between 1975 and 1991, when it was known as the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (, MRND), the MRND was the only legal political party in the country. It was dominated by Hutus, particularly from President Juvenal Habyarimana's home region of Northern Rwanda. The elite group of MRND party members who were known to have influence on the President and his wife are known as the akazu. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the MRND was banned. ==History== The party was established by Habyarimana on 5 July 1975, exactly two years after he had ousted the first post-independence president Gr√©goire Kayibanda in a coup d'√©tat. Habyarimana established a totalitarian state and banned the Parmehutu party, which had been dominated by Hutus from southern Rwanda. The MRND succeeded the Parmehutu in its position of the dominant state party. A new constitution was approved in a 1978 referendum, making the country a one-party state in which every citizen was automatically considered to be a member of the MRND.Aimable Twagilimana (2007) Historical Dictionary of Rwanda, Scarecrow Press, p. 116.Constitution de la R√©publique Rwandaise du 20 d√©cembre 1978, Art. 7: \\"Tout Rwandais est de plein droit membre du Mouvement r√©volutionnaire national pour le d√©veloppement.\\" Presidential elections were held in 1978 with Habyarimana as the sole candidate. He was re-elected with 99% of the vote.Elections in Rwanda African Elections Database Parliamentary elections followed in 1981, with two MRND candidates contesting each of the 64 seats. Habyarimana was re-elected again in 1983 and 1988, whilst parliamentary elections were held under the same system in 1983 (with the National Assembly enlarged to 70 seats) and 1988. The party's name was changed after the legalisation of opposition parties in 1991. The youth wing of the party, the interahamwe, later developed into a militia group that played a key role in the Genocide against Tutsi. After Habyarimana's death in April 1994, hardline elements of the party were among the chief architects of the genocide; the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which played a significant role, was originally a hard-line faction of the MRND that became a separate party. After Rwanda was conquered by the rival Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front led by Paul Kagame, both the MRND and the CDR were driven from power and banned in July 1994.Robert E. Gribbin (2005) In the Aftermath of Genocide: The U.S. Role in Rwanda, iUniverse, p153 ==Ideology== Habyarimana was described as relatively moderate, though he (and his regime) are said to have used propaganda methods of the extreme right, ethnically discriminating against the Tutsi (albeit less extreme than their predecessors), advanced a conservative social agenda and were anti-communist. ==Structure== Habyarimana was the president of the party, and as such was the only candidate for president of the republic. However, in a minor concession to democracy, voters were presented with two MRND candidates at Legislative Assembly elections.

It is on the Northwest Side of the city. The northern border is Addison Street from the north branch of the Chicago River in the east to Pulaski Road in the west. The neighborhood extends further west along Belmont Avenue to the Union Pacific/Northwest Line. Its southern border is Diversey Avenue from the Union Pacific/Northwest Line to the Chicago River. ==History== The first European settler in Avondale was Abraham Harris who settled the area three years after its 1850 incorporation into Jefferson Township. In 1869, Avondale was incorporated as a village. It has been speculated that developer and Pennsylvania native John Lewis Cochran named the village in honor of the miners and rescue workers who died in the Avondale coal mine fire. Atypical for the time, Avondale was racially integrated in the nineteenth century with twenty African American families moving to the area and building Avondale's first church in the 1880s. Avondale, along with the rest of Jefferson Township, was annexed by the City of Chicago in 1889. Factories and other industries sprang up around the start of the 20th century due to the Chicago River and Avondale's dense network of transportation corridors that were built in the 1870s and improved after its annexation into Chicago including replacement of cable cars with electric powered streetcars. The resulting jobs in the area were responsible for drawing the initial wave of European immigrants. Avondale was the site of one of Chicago's \\"Seven Lost Wonders\\", the Olson Park and Waterfall complex at Diversey and Pulaski. Beginning in the 1980s, Latino settlement began in Avondale. A multiplicity of other diverse Eastern European ethnicities came to the area following the End of Communism in 1989, leading to Avondale's nickname as the neighborhood \\"Where Eastern Europe meets Latin America\\". Starting in the mid-2000s, gentrification began to take hold in the Avondale area as it had in neighboring Wicker Park, Logan Square and Bucktown. ==Demographics== Avondale has traditionally had a large Polish population, with patches of German, Scandinavian, and Italians settlement as well. In recent years this blue-collar neighborhood has witnessed an increase in its social diversity. The collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe witnessed an influx of Eastern European immigrants such as Czechs, Slovaks, Ukrainians and Belarusians, particularly alongside Poles in the \\"Polish Village\\". The emigration of peoples from the Soviet Bloc in Avondale since then has grown to include Russophone nationals from Central Asia and even Mongolia. A strong Filipino community is present in Avondale as well, which is home to Chicago's Filipino TV outlet. Latino settlement beginning in the 1980s led to an increase in Avondale's Hispanic population from 37.6% in 1990 to 62.0% in 2000, with increased numbers of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Central American immigrants. Because of gentrification, the last decade has seen a reversal of this trend, as the non-Hispanic white population has been expanding faster than the Hispanic population. ==Transportation== Avondale is served by the 'L' at two stations along the Blue Line. The station is on the northeastern edge next to the Kennedy Expressway at the intersection of Kimball Avenue and Belmont, less than three blocks away from St. Hyacinth's former mission of Our Lady of Lourdes; the station is located in the median of the same expressway adjacent to the neighboring Villa District. Avondale is also accessible by a number of bus routes run by the CTA. *Running Northwest/ Southeast: **\`56 Milwaukee\` *Running North/ South: **\`49 Western\` **\`52 Kedzie/California\` **\`53 Pulaski\` **\`82 Kimball-Homan\` *Running East/ West: **\`76 Diversey\` **\`77 Belmont\` **\`152 Addison\` ==Neighborhoods== ===Polish Village=== Milwaukee Avenue Rahm Emanuel speaking at St. Hyacinth Basilica. St. Wenceslaus. Photographer Richard Nickel was married here in 1950. The Polish Village or Jackowo and Wac≈Çawowo , together make up one of Chicago's largest and most vibrant Polish Patches. The neighborhoods derive their Polish names from the two contiguous Polish Roman Catholic parishes- Saint Hyacinth's Basilica (Bazylika ≈öw. Jacka) and St. Wenceslaus Church (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈öwiƒôtego Wac≈Çawa). Milwaukee Avenue is the district's main commercial strip, which includes a number of sausage shops, restaurants, and bakeries. In English the area is usually referred to as the Polish Village - the name featured on signs hung on street lamps over the district. Pulaski Avenue, named after the Polish Revolutionary War hero, runs through the area. The Polish communities of Jackowo and Wac≈Çawowo appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Polish settlement spread further northwest along Milwaukee Avenue. The neighborhood experienced its heyday as the cultural nexus of Chicago's Polonia during the 1980s and 1990s with the so-called Solidarity and Post-Solidarity waves of Polish migration to Chicago, including a number of political refugees. Until the recent installation of an automated system, on Sunday mornings the CTA driver would announce \\"Yats- koh- voh\\", signaling the stop for St. Hyacinth Basilica as Poles shuttled off the bus on their way to Mass. Local landmarks and institutions increasingly became revitalized and renewed while taking on an increasingly ethnic hue by catering to these recent arrivals from Poland. The historic Milford Theatre served as the central Polish cinema arts venue like Jefferson Park's Gateway Theater today, with locals giving it the nickname \\"Cinema Polski\\", drawing even street photographer Vivian Maier. A distinct flowering of Polish arts and culture took place here in Avondale, an environment where Poles could finally freely express themselves without worrying about incurring the wrath of government censors or political repression. The events and activities organized here by Chicago's Polish community played a key role in shaping the chain of events that eventually resulted in the collapse of the Communist government in Poland, bringing down the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since after World War II. An expressive and now decaying mural in the McDonald's parking lot combining Polish patriotic and folkloric motifs by Caryl Yasko titled \\"Razem\\", or together in Polish, was painted thanks in part to funds furnished by the Polish American Congress in 1975. It now stands near the corners of Belmont and Pulaski in mute testament to this bygone renaissance. Just to the north of Jackowo is Wac≈Çawowo and the parish of St. Wenceslaus, with its impressive church. Housing stock there primarily consists of brick two-flats built in the first half of the 20th century prior to World War II, although there are a number of bungalows present in the area neighboring the Villa District to the north. ===Belmont Gardens=== Belmont Gardens spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Kosciuszko Park, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. The boundaries of Belmont Gardens are generally held to be Pulaski Road to the East, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the West, Belmont Avenue to the North, and Fullerton Avenue to the South. Most of the land between Fullerton Avenue and Diversey Avenue as well as Kimball Avenue to the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line was empty as late as the 1880s, mostly consisting of the rural \\"truck farms\\" that peppered much of Jefferson Township. This began to change with the annexation of this rustic hinterland to the city in 1889 in anticipation of the World's Columbian Exposition that would focus the country's eyes on Chicago just a few years later in 1893. Belmont Gardens's first urban development began thanks to Homer Pennock, who founded the industrial village of Pennock, Illinois. Centered on Wrightwood Avenue, which was originally laid out as \\"Pennock Boulevard\\", was planned to be a hefty industrial and residential district. The development was so renowned that the village was highlighted in a \\"History of Cook County, Illinois\\" authored by Weston Arthur Goodspeed and Daniel David Healy. Thwarted by circumstances as well as the decline of Homer Pennock's fortune, this district declined to the point that the Chicago Tribune wrote about the neighborhood in an article titled \\"A Deserted Village in Chicago\\" in 1903. The original name of the Healy Metra Station was originally named after this now lost settlement. While Homer Pennock's industrial suburb failed, Chicago's rapid expansion transformed the area's farms into clusters of factories and homes. At the start of the 20th century as settlement was booming, Belmont Gardens and Avondale were at the Northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue \\"Polish Corridor\\"- a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from Polonia Triangle at Milwaukee, Division and Ashland to Irving Park Road. Belmont Gardens offered more than just a less congested setting for its new residents. Due to its proximity to rail along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, the area developed a plethora of industry that still survives in the city's Pulaski Industrial Corridor. It was adjacent to his own factory that Mr. Walter E. Olson built what the Chicago Tribune put at the top of its list of the \\"Seven Lost Wonders of Chicago\\", the Olson Park and Waterfall Complex, a 22-acre garden and waterfall remembered by Chicagoans citywide as the place they fondly reminisce heading out to for family trips on the weekend. The ambitious project took 200 workers more than six months to fashion it out of 800 tons of stone and 800 yards of soil. Latino settlement in the neighborhood began in the 1980s. Today the area still retains its blue collar feel as much of surrounding Logan Square and Avondale undergo increased gentrification. ===Kosciuszko Park=== Kosciuszko Park spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Belmont Gardens, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. Colloquially known by locals as \\"Koz Park\\", or even the \\"Land of Koz\\", the area is a prime example of a local identity born thanks to the green spaces created by Chicago's civic leaders of the Progressive Era. The boundaries of Kosciuszko Park are generally held to be Central Park Avenue to the East, Pulaski Road to the West, George Street to the North, and Altgeld to the South. Most of the land between Fullerton Avenue and Diversey Avenue as well as Kimball Avenue to Pulaski Road was empty as late as the 1880s, mostly consisting of the rural \\"truck farms\\" that peppered much of Jefferson Township. This began to change with the annexation of this rustic hinterland to the city in 1889 in anticipation of the World's Columbian Exposition that would focus the country's eyes on Chicago just a few years later in 1893. Kosciuszko Park's first urban development began thanks to Homer Pennock, who founded the industrial village of Pennock, Illinois. Centered on Wrightwood Avenue, which was originally laid out as \\"Pennock Boulevard\\", was planned to be a hefty industrial and residential district. The development was so renowned that the village was highlighted in a \\"History of Cook County, Illinois\\" authored by Weston Arthur Goodspeed and Daniel David Healy. Thwarted by circumstances as well as the decline of Homer Pennock's fortune, this district declined to the point that the Chicago Tribune wrote about the neighborhood in an article titled \\"A Deserted Village in Chicago\\" in 1903. While Homer Pennock's industrial suburb failed, Chicago's rapid expansion transformed the area's farms into clusters of factories and homes. At the start of the 20th century as settlement was booming, Kosciuszko Park and Avondale were at the Northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue \\"Polish Corridor\\"- a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from Polonia Triangle at Milwaukee, Division and Ashland to Irving Park Road. Kosciuszko Park offered more than just a less congested setting for its new residents. Due to its proximity to rail along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, the area developed a plethora of industry that still survives in the city's Pulaski Industrial Corridor. Adjacent to Kosciuszko Park's border with Avondale proper near the intersection of George Street and Lawndale Avenue is St. Hyacinth Basilica, which began in 1894 as a refuge for locals to tend to their spiritual needs. A local shrine, St. Hyacinth's features relics associated with Pope John Paul II, as well as an icon with an ornate jeweled crown that was blessed by the late pontiff. Other institutions further enriched the institutional fabric of the Polish community in the area. In 1897, the Polish Franciscan Sisters began building an expansive complex on Schubert and Hamlin Avenues with the construction of St. Joseph Home for the Aged and Crippled, a structure that would also serve as the motherhouse for the order. When it opened in 1898, it became the city's first and oldest Catholic nursing home. One of the industries the nuns took upon themselves to support these charitable activities was a church vestment workshop which opened in 1909 on the second floor. In 1928 the Franciscan Sisters further expanded the complex by building a new St. Joseph Home of Chicago, a structure that stood until recently at 2650 North Ridgeway. Designed by the distinguished firm of Slupkowski and Piontek who built many of the most prestigious commissions in Chicago's Polish community such as the Art Deco headquarters of the Polish National Alliance and Holy Trinity High School among others, the brick structure was an imposing edifice. One of the building's highlights was a chapel with an altar that was dedicated to the Black Madonna. The entire complex was sold to a developer who subsequently razed the entire complex, while the new \\"St. Joseph Village\\" opened in 2005 on the site of the former Madonna High School and now operates at 4021 W. Belmont Avenue. The park later became home to one of the two first Polish language Saturday schools in Chicago. While the school has since moved out of their small quarters at the park fieldhouse, the Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko School of Polish Language continues to educate over 1,000 students to the present day, reminding all of its origins in Kosciuszko Park with its name. It was the park of Kosciuszko Park however that weaved together the disparate subdivisions and people into one community. Dedicated in 1916, Kosciuszko Park owes its name to the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko. Best known as the designer and builder of West Point, Kosciuszko fought in the American Revolution and was awarded with U.S. citizenship and the rank of brigadier general as a reward. Kosciuszko was one of the original parks of the Northwest Park District which was established in 1911. One of the ambitious goals of the Northwest Park District that was in keeping with the spirit of the Progressive Movement popular at the time was to provide one park for each of the ten square miles under its jurisdiction. Beginning in 1914, the district began to purchase land for what would eventually become Mozart, Kelyvn, and Kosciuszko Parks, and improvement on these three sites began almost immediately. For Kosciuszko, noted architect Albert A. Schwartz designed a Tudor revival-style fieldhouse, expanded in 1936 to include an assembly hall, just two years after the 22 separate park districts were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. The park complex expanded during the 1980s with the addition of a new natatorium at the corner of Diversey and Avers. The green space afforded by the park quickly became the backdrop for community gatherings. Residents utilized the grounds at Kosciuszko Park for bonfires, festivals and neighborhood celebrations, and for a time, even an ice skating rink that would be set up every winter. Summertime brought the opportunity for outdoor festivities, peppered with sports and amateur shows featuring softball games, social dancing, a music appreciation hour, and the occasional visit by the city's \\"mobile zoo\\". Today \\"The Land of Koz\\" is a diverse neighborhood, and becoming even more so as gentrification advances further northwest. New people are entering Kosciuszko Park and joining earlier residents whose roots trace back to Latin America and Poland. Yet the park that lent the neighborhood its name still serves its residents, where through play, performance, and even the occasional outdoor film screening it functions as the venue where the community can come together. ==Economy== In 1937, Dad's Root Beer was founded in Avondale by Ely Klapman and Barney Berns. The company operated a bottling plant in the community before the company moved operations. The factory has since been converted into condominiums. As of 2014, the top 5 employing industry sectors in Avondale are retail trade (20.9%), manufacturing (14.8%), utilities (12.4%), accommodation and food service (9.8%), and finance (7.4%). Over half of these workers come from outside of Chicago and 45.5% come from outside of Avondale within the city. The top 5 employing industry sectors of community residents are accommodation and food service (11.5%), healthcare (11%), professional (10.1%), retail trade (9.6%), and administration (8.3%). ==Education== Avondale residents are served by Chicago Public Schools, which includes neighborhood and citywide options for students. There are also a number of private parochial schools run by Roman Catholic congregations in the area. Carl Von Linne School, 3221 N. Sacramento, on Sacramento between Belmont and School is a neighborhood school. The school features a comprehensive gifted program and a dual language program. There is an emphasis on fine arts including visual arts, ceramic, music, dance, digital arts, and culinary arts. The school has a \\"sprouting teens garden\\" on the east side of the building and a \\"kitchen community culinary garden\\" in the main playground. The United Neighborhood Organization operates the Carlos Fuentes School in Avondale.\\"UNO Charter Schools .\\" United Neighborhood Organization. Retrieved on June 16, 2012. ==Public libraries== The Chicago Public Library operates no branches located in the Avondale community area. Although the branch in nearby Kosciuszko Park was one of the system's most utilized branches, it was closed by the 1950s. ==Politics== The Avondale community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Avondale cast 10,290 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,345 votes for Donald Trump (83.77% to 10.95%). In the 2012 presidential election, Avondale cast 7,940 votes for Barack Obama and cast 1,415 votes for Mitt Romney (82.43% to 14.69%). ==Parks== Avondale was cited by the Chicago Tribune as being in the top tier of Chicago's \\"park poor\\" neighborhoods. This situation was further aggravated when Avondale Park was reduced to just over one acre in size during the building of the Kennedy Expressway, taking over most of its green space, including the park's playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box and tennis courts while leaving the fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld intact. The substantial green spaces in the Avondale community area are Brands Park, followed by Avondale Park. Parks adjacent to Avondale such as Kosciuszko Park, Athletic Field Park and Ken-Well Park are heavily utilized by residents as well. Additionally, there are playlots under the supervision of other parks such as Grape Playlot, Park-view Playlot, Nelson Playlot, Elston Playlot, and Sacramento Playlot, found within Avondale. ==Culture== Avondale has a number of strong and simultaneously diverse cultural centers. St. Hyacinth Basilica continues to be a strong cultural and civic institution for Chicago's Polish Community. True to stereotype, the neighborhood \\"where Eastern Europe meets Latin America\\" is also home to the new second location of the Puerto Rican Arts Alliance in the former firehouse of Engine 91. The Hairpin Arts Center is located in Avondale near its border with Logan Square at the gateway to Chicago's Polish Village, serving all of the diverse communities who make their home in these neighborhoods. ==Notable people== * Vivian Maier, photographer who achieved posthumous fame. A resident of various neighborhoods including Rogers Park, she took photos in Chicago's Polish Village. * Lucy Parsons, labor organizer and founder of Industrial Workers of the World. She perished in a fire in Avondale in 1942. * Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, member of the Chicago City Council representing the 26th ward and the first openly gay, Latino alderman. He is a resident of Avondale. * Louise Schaaf (1906-2020), supercentenarian notable for being, at the time of her death, the oldest person in Illinois and the oldest known person born in Germany. She resided near Belmont and California in Avondale until 1959 when she moved to the Norwood Park neighborhood. ==See also== * Polish Cathedral style * Polish American ==References== == External links == * Official City of Chicago Avondale Community Map * Avondale, Chicago Webliography * The History of Avondale and Chicago's Polish Village * Holiday in Avondale, Forgotten Chicago's take on Avondale * Avondale and Chicago's Polish Village in the newsletter of the Northwest Chicago Historical Society * Avondale Neighborhood Association Category:Community areas of Chicago Category:North Side, Chicago Category:Polish-American culture in Chicago Category:Ethnic enclaves in Illinois Category:Polish communities in the United States ","title":"Avondale, Chicago"},{"id":"1297758","text":"Snook, the alter-ego of Pete Soucy, is a Newfoundland comedian and actor.

State Repression and the Domestic Democratic Peace New York: Cambridge University Press.Davenport, Christian, Johnston, Hank and Mueller, Carol (2004). Repression and Mobilization Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. It is often manifested through policies such as human rights violations, surveillance abuse, police brutality, imprisonment, involuntary settlement, stripping of citizen's rights, lustration and violent action or terror such as the murder, summary executions, torture, forced disappearance and other extrajudicial punishment of political activists, dissidents, or general population.Kittrie, Nicholas N. 1995. The War Against Authority: From the Crisis of Legitimacy to a New Social Contract. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership and by self-censorship within the public. Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute state terrorism, genocide, politicide or crimes against humanity. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes.Serge, Victor, 1979, What Everyone Should Know About State Repression, London: New Park Publications. Acts of political repression may be carried out by secret police forces, army, paramilitary groups or death squads. Repressive activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well.Donner, Frank J. (1980). The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods of America‚Äôs Political Intelligence System. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Donner, Frank J. (1990). Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads and Police Repression in Urban America. Berkeley: University of California Press. This can even include setting up situations where the death of the target of repression is the end result.Haas, Jeffrey. The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther. Chicago, Ill.: Lawrence Hill /Chicago Review, 2010. If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example are the FBI COINTELPRO operations in the United States between 1956 and 1971.COINTELPRO: The FBI's Covert Action Programs Against American Citizens, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities.Cunningham, D. 2004. There‚Äôs something happening here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI counterintelligence. Berkeley: Univ. of California. In some states, \\"repression\\" can be an official term used in legislation or the names of government institutions. For example, the Soviet Union had a legal policy of repression of political opposition defined in the penal code and Cuba under Fulgencio Batista had a secret police agency officially named the \\"Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities\\". ==In political conflict== Political conflict strongly increases the likelihood of state repression. This is arguably the most robust finding in social science research on political repression ‚Äì civil wars are a strong predictor of repressive activity, as are other forms of challenges from non-government actors. States so often engage in repressive behaviors in times of civil conflict that the relationship between these two phenomena has been termed the \\"Law of Coercive Responsiveness\\". When their authority or legitimacy is threatened, regimes respond by overtly or covertly suppressing dissidents to eliminate the behavioral threat. State repression subsequently affects dissident mobilization, though the direction of this effect is still an open question. Some strong evidence suggests that repression suppresses dissident mobilization by reducing the capacity of challengers to organize, yet it is also feasible that challengers can leverage state repressive behavior to spur mobilization among sympathizers by framing repression as a new grievance against the state. == Violence == Political repression is often accompanied by violence, which might be legal or illegal according to domestic law. Violence can both eliminate political opposition directly by killing opposition members, or indirectly by instilling fear. == Intolerance == Political repression is sometimes accompanied with intolerance. This intolerance is manifested through discriminatory policies, human rights violations, police brutality, imprisonment, extermination, exile, extortion, terrorism, extrajudicial killing, summary execution, torture, forced disappearance and other punishments against political activists, dissidents, and population in general. == State terrorism == When political repression is sanctioned and organized by the state, situations of state terrorism, genocide and crimes against humanity can be reached. Systematic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarianisms and similar regimes. In these regimes, acts of political repression can be carried out by the police and secret police, the army, paramilitary groups and death squads. Sometimes regimes considered democratic exercise political repression and state terrorism to other states as part of their security policy. ==See also== *Autocracy *Forced disappearance *Police state *Politicide *Political prisoner *Political violence *Preventive repression *Restrictions on political parties ==References== ==Further reading== Articles * Understanding Covert Repressive Action: The Case of the U.S. Government against the Republic of New Africa (186kb PDF file) by Christian Davenport, Professor, University of Maryland. * State Repression and Political Order by Christian Davenport, Professor, University of Maryland.

[...]\\" charged with the operation of state parks and historic sites within the U.S. state of New York. As of 2014, the NYS OPRHP manages nearly of public lands and facilities, including 180 state parks and 35 historic sites, that are visited by over 62 million visitors each year. ==History== The agency that would become the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP) was created in 1970; however, the history of state parks and historic sites in New York stretches back to the latter part of the 19th century. Management of state-owned parks, and guidance for the entire state park system, was accomplished by various regional commissions, private organizations, statewide advisory councils, and divisions within other state agencies prior to the establishment of NYS OPRHP, which grew from the framework created by these earlier organizations. ===Initial acquisitions=== Prospect Point at the Niagara Reservation, c. 1900. The reservation, known today as Niagara Falls State Park, was the first park opened by New York State. State-level procurement and management of parks in New York began in 1883, when then-governor Grover Cleveland signed legislation authorizing the appropriation of lands near Niagara Falls for a \\"state reservation\\". Two years later, the Niagara Reservation, known today as Niagara Falls State Park, opened to the public. The park is claimed to be the oldest state park in the United States, and was the first established via eminent domain. The State Reservation on the St. Lawrence was authorized in 1896, and by 1898 it included modest state holdings in the Thousand Islands region of New York. During the early 20th century, the state continued to expand its public parks system with several large additions, including Letchworth State Park in 1906, Fire Island State Park (known today as Robert Moses State Park) in 1908, John Boyd Thacher State Park in 1914, Enfield Glen State Park (today's Robert H. Treman State Park) in 1920, and Allegany State Park in 1921. A coordinated effort to protect portions of the Hudson Palisades from the damaging effects of quarrying resulted in the creation of a number of state parks in the 1910s and 1920s, including Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park. ===NYS Council of Parks=== Throughout these early acquisitions, the state lacked a formal statewide agency or organization to coordinate management and development of state parks. Instead, parks were managed by independent regional commissions, such as the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, or by organizations such as the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. To address the need for statewide coordination, the New York State Council of Parks was created by legislation adopted on April 18, 1924. The council served to plan development and set standard policies for all New York state-owned parks, reservations, and historic sites that were not under the authority of the New York State Conservation Commission (which notably included those lands that comprised the Forest Preserve in the Adirondacks and Catskills). Its formation was supported by governor Alfred E. Smith and based on plans by Robert Moses, who became the council's first commissioner; Moses would remain in charge of the council until 1963. Robert Moses laid the groundwork for the State Council of Parks, and led the council from 1924 to 1963. The council initially included representatives from regional park commissions and other organizations involved in park management, including the Conservation Commission and the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. Prior to the creation of the Division of Parks (see below), the State Council of Parks was the highest-level organization overseeing park management in the state. Although it later became an advisory body, the council continues to this day, known officially as the New York State Council of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. It includes representatives from the following departments and commissions as of 2014: *New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation *New York State Department of Environmental Conservation *New York State Board for Historic Preservation *Allegany State Park Commission *Central State Park Commission *Finger Lakes State Park Commission *Genesee State Park Commission *Long Island State Park Commission *New York City State Park Commission *Niagara Frontier State Park Commission *Palisades Interstate Park Commission *Saratoga-Capital District State Park Commission *Taconic State Park Commission *Thousand Islands State Park Commission ===NYS Conservation Department Division of Parks=== A reorganization of New York's state government took place in 1926, which resulted in the creation of the New York State Conservation Department. The newly formed Conservation Department included a Division of Parks which assumed responsibility for management of New York's parks and historic sites. The Council of Parks continued as a constituent unit of the Division of Parks. The council was also at this time given the additional responsibility of planning highway improvements to enable access to park facilities. Workers completing a Civilian Conservation Corps barracks in 1934 at Green Lakes State Park in Fayetteville, New York Although the Great Depression of the 1930s reduced available funding for New York's state parks, the period was a time of development of existing parks' facilities. Construction teams comprising workers employed through federal programs such as the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, Civil Works Administration, and Works Progress Administration cleared woodlands, performed maintenance tasks, and built roads, trails, golf courses, buildings, and furniture for New York's parks through the 1930s and early 1940s. As the Depression came to a close with the United States joining World War II in 1941, New York State was managing 74 parks welcoming a combined 20 million visitors annually. However, the Division of Parks' responsibilities were reduced in 1944 when 27 State Historic Sites were placed under the jurisdiction of the New York State Education Department. These sites were eventually returned to the Conservation Department in 1966; in the same year, the New York State Historic Trust (which later became the New York State Board for Historic Preservation) was created to help guide their management. The Palisades Interstate Parkway was a priority project during the 1950s. New York's park system continued expansion after World War II ended. The creation or completion of various parkways in the state, such as the Palisades Interstate Parkway and Lake Ontario Parkway, received priority during the 1950s. As visitation to New York's state parks increased following the war, new lands were sought for state parks, including unsuccessful attempts to expand into the Forest Preserve. Increased funding for parks made available in the 1960s did allow for the purchase of several large tracts throughout the state for parkland development. The state also began at this time to expand into new areas, such as an increase in boating facilities and establishment of parks within New York City. ===NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation=== A major shift in New York's park management came in 1970 with legislation that created the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which was tasked with all responsibilities of the former Conservation Department, with the exception of managing the state's parks and historic sites outside of the Forest Preserve. The former Division of Parks was upgraded to become an independent agency, known as the New York State Office of Parks and Recreation. Legislation enacted in 1972 gave the agency direct control of New York's park lands, with the State Council of Parks and regional commissions retaining an advisory role in management. The agency's name was updated in 1981 to its current form, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP). Sandy Island Beach State Park, opened in 2006, was one of many parks added to the state under Governor George Pataki. The state park system underwent a period of rapid expansion during former governor George Pataki's administration. Between 1995 and 2007, Pataki, along with then-parks commissioner Bernadette Castro, opened 28 new state parks. Although the governor was lauded as a conservationist for his actions, the new parks increased financial burdens on the NYS OPRHP, whose funding for operations remained steady. In 2010, a statewide fiscal crisis led to an announcement that 55 state parks and historic sites would be closed. The threatened closures were eventually averted, with budget shortfalls made up through reduced staffing and hours at many parks, closure of some internal facilities such as campgrounds and golf courses, and increases in user fees. The 2010 fiscal crisis resulted in decreased availability of funds for maintenance and upkeep at New York's parks. To help address an estimated $1 billion in needed repairs, $143 million in funds were made available in 2012; the money came from a combination of state, federal, and private grant sources. Sustained funding for repairs was announced in 2015, with the state planning to spend $900 million by 2020 at parks and historic sites throughout the state. ==Facilities== Link Trail, near Cazenovia, New York As of 2014, the NYS OPRHP administered: * of public land * 180 state parks * 35 state historic sites * 67 developed beaches * 36 swimming pools * 27 marinas * 40 boat launch sites * 29 golf courses * 817 cabins and rental houses * 8,355 campsites * of trails * 18 nature centers == See also == *Adirondack Park Agency *List of New York state park golf courses *New York City Department of Parks and Recreation *New York State Park Police ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ** State Parks ** Historic Sites ** Golf Courses ** Trails *Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations Category:State agencies of New York (state) OPRHP Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States Category:Organizations based in Albany, New York Category:1970 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation"},{"id":"1297776","text":"Trimmatom nanus, the midget dwarfgoby, is a species of marine goby native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.

He is the son of the author Leonard Michaels and was married to producer Audrey Marrs. His lyrics deal with politics, racism, and general social issues. He is most well known as the vocalist for the ska punk band Operation Ivy. ==Musical overview== Jesse Michaels grew up in Berkeley, California, where he became involved with the local punk and hardcore music scene in the early eighties. As a very young participant, he attended performances by many formative punk and hardcore bands. The Bay Area was also home to a small but enthusiastic second wave ska scene and Michaels was exposed to much two tone ska music, including performances by Berkeley's The Uptones. Michaels' early musical experimentation involved playing in garage bands including a primitive collaboration with Jeff Ott and Aaron Cometbus who would later go on to form the band Crimpshrine. Throughout the eighties he was involved with the publication of fanzines, including 1987's Kill Deal for 50 Cents. Later that year he formed Operation Ivy with guitarist Tim Armstrong, bassist Matt Freeman, and drummer Dave Mello. They quickly became a popular band especially at the Berkeley punk club 924 Gilman Street. In 1987, the group released its debut extended play Hectic on which Michaels wrote all of the lyrics. It was followed with an American tour which brought the group's work all around the country, and made Operation Ivy a very well respected band. Operation Ivy recorded and released its only studio album Energy in 1989 and broke up the same year. Michaels also co-wrote the music to the Green Day song \\"2,000 Light Years Away\\" from their second album Kerplunk (1992). He later formed Big Rig in 1994. Big Rig released one extended play and played several gigs around 924 Gilman Street before breaking up. In 1999 after a long hiatus he formed Common Rider with Squirtgun bassist and renowned producer Mass Giorgini. They released two albums and toured around the country before breaking up in 2003. In August 2008, Jesse went on a short Southern California tour with long-time friend Jeff Ott, playing new solo songs. In December 2008, he participated in a small Northern California tour with Mike Park and Kevin Seconds, as well as formed a new band, Classics of Love. Michaels has stated in interviews and biographical material that the reason for his sporadic / intermittent involvement with music is that he does not consider himself a full-time musician, instead preferring to play music as an avocation rather than a career. Michaels collaborated with former Operation Ivy bandmate Tim Armstrong for the 2013 original song \\"Living In A Dangerous Land\\" as part of the Tim Timebomb And Friends series. Michaels has expressed an interest in writing. In a 2010 interview, he told Jewcy, \\"I have written one book. It's a novella and I'm sort of shopping it around and it might get published this year.\\" The book was originally titled What The Dead Have To Say but just before self-publishing, Michaels received interest from Soft Skull Press, an independent imprint which is known for bridging the gap between literary fiction and fringe cultural interests. Soft Skull agreed to publish Michaels' novel but the title was changed to Whispering Bodies: A Roy Belkin Disaster. The book was released in September 2013. Whispering Bodies is a comic novel about a recluse who is forced to enter the world at large in order to clear the name of a woman who he believes has been falsely accused of a crime. In 2015 Michaels graduated from UCLA where he received a BA in literature. He continues to write and is currently making short films with an eye to creating a feature. As part of his continued visual art practice, he recently created the movie poster for an upcoming documentary about East Bay punk music produced by Green Day and associated management entities. Although he is no longer an active musician, he cites punk music as a formative aesthetic influence and continues to direct his creative energies towards film, literature and visual art. Michaels is also regarded as a talented artist, responsible for designing Operation Ivy's well-known and widely recognized \\"Ska Man\\" logo as well as other artwork for the album. In addition to drawing logos, album covers and other assorted art for his own musical projects, his artwork has been used by bands such as Filth, Neurosis, Green Day (for the band's debut album 39/Smooth) and Against All Authority. Michaels has recently been making reprints of sketches and other art available for sale on eBay on a limited basis. As an oil painter, Michaels has exhibited his work around the West Coast. In 2005, Jesse collaborated with Chris Appelgren of Lookout! Records to launch Dynaformer, an art/design collective dedicated to showcasing the artwork of both individuals, as well as offering their artistic talents for hire. Although Dynaformer was short-lived, Michaels and Apelgren continue to collaborate. In 2013 the pair teamed up to produce the cover of Michaels' debut novel as well as creating an EP design for a solo record by Murder City Devils' Spencer Moody. In 2015, Jesse sang on the track \\"System Fucked\\" featured on the Left√∂ver Crack album Constructs of the State. ==References== ==External links== *Jesse Michaels' personal website *The Roots of Rebellion Show Interview with Jesse Michaels *The official Myspace of Jesse Michaels Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:American male singer- songwriters Category:American punk rock singers Category:American punk rock guitarists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American rock songwriters Category:American Buddhists Category:Musicians from Berkeley, California Category:Operation Ivy (band) members Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) alumni Category:Jews in punk rock Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Guitarists from California Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Hopeless Records artists Category:Asian Man Records artists Category:Taylor Allderdice High School alumni ","title":"Jesse Michaels"},{"id":"1297794","text":"The Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS ) is an academic and research institution for the study of oceanography and the atmospheric sciences within the University of Miami (UM). It is located on a 16 acre (65,000 m¬≤) campus on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida. It is the only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States. Up until 2008, RSMAS was solely a graduate school within the University of Miami, while it jointly administrated an undergraduate program with UM's College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the Rosenstiel School has taken over administrative responsibilities for the undergraduate program, granting Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) baccalaureate degree. Master's, including a Master of Professional Science degree, and doctorates are also awarded to RSMAS students by the UM Graduate School. The Rosenstiel School's research includes the study of marine life, particularly Aplysia and coral; climate change; air-sea interactions; coastal ecology; and admiralty law. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland sinkhole. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite downlink facility. The school is home to the world's largest hurricane simulation tank. ==History== The sign near the entrance to RSMAS. In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe recruited F.G. Walton Smith, a young British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory. In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus. In 1947, a delegation from Dade County prompted the Florida State Legislature to support the development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the State Board of Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961, it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences. In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts & Sciences. The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the Pew Charitable Trusts, and in 2008, the program relocated to SUNY at Stony Brook. In 2008, RSMAS took over administrative functions of the University of Miami's undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs. Also in 2008, RSMAS's library merged with the central University of Miami Library. Recently, RSMAS started unique a one-year Master of Professional Science degree program aimed at students planning non-research careers in business, government, or non- profit organizations. ==Academics== Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science's courtyard, with the Grosvenor Building on the left. While the graduate programs are conducted by the RSMAS faculty who in turn report to the Dean of RSMAS, the University of Miami's Graduate School awards the graduate degrees. RSMAS offers a joint program with the UM Law School which awards its students both a Juris Doctor degree and a Master of Arts in Marine Affairs and Policy. RSMAS also administrates the University of Miami's undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs on the main campus in Coral Gables, Florida. The Rosenstiel School is divided into six academic divisions, each focusing on a different aspect of oceanography: * Ocean Sciences (fluid dynamics, remote sensing, waves) * Marine Ecosystem and Society (admiralty law, aquaculture, marine conservation, maritime archaeology, natural resource economics, political ecology) * Marine Biology & Ecology * Marine Geosciences * Atmospheric Sciences In addition to the academic divisions, RSMAS also has several research units: the Oceans and Human Health Center, the National Resource for Aplysia, the National Center for Coral Reef Research, the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS), and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. , 358 professors and scientists conduct research programs and teach at RSMAS and the Coral Gables campus. Of these, 81 are regular full-time faculty members. The school operates the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran was put on water in 2000. It is equipped with a special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil. The Rosenstiel School's research invertebrate museum houses one of the world's most extensive collections of invertebrate tropical marine life with 400,000 specimens. It includes Atlantic tropical marine invertebrates. The collection consists of 60,000 specimen lots, out of which 38,900 are cataloged and identified species. Since 2005, RSMAS has conducted an underwater photography contest that draws international submissions. RSMAS also makes underwater photographs available through its Digital Atlas of Marine Species and Locations, which is a database that includes photos of specific marine species. Since 1951, RSMAS has published the Bulletin of Marine Science a scientific journal which publishes research papers in the marine subject areas covered by the school. It is published four times a year. The United States National Research Council ranked graduate research programs based on 2008 data, and RSMAS ranked 11th to 40th among Oceanography, Atmospheric Sciences, and Meteorology Rankings. The RSMAS entering graduate students' Average Quantitative Graduate Record Examination score was 681. ==Campus== RSMAS's Marine Science Center The Virginia Key campus includes classroom facilities, laboratories, a dock, and a student center. The center, called the F. G. Walton Smith Commons, holds a cafeteria and a bar (aka \\"the wet lab\\") that was rated as one of Miami's best secrets by the Miami New Times in 2008. The RSMAS campus features mangroves, sea grape trees, and other dune plants to protect its sand dunes and the campus from storm damage. In 2009, UM received a $15 million federal grant to help construct a new $43.8 million, Marine Technology and Life Sciences Seawater Research Building. The Virginia Key campus is located at a marine research and education park that is also home to two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research laboratories and the Maritime and Science Technology Academy magnet school. RSMAS also operates a site on mainland Miami-Dade County that was formerly the United States Naval Observatory Secondary National Time Standard Facility, which already had buildings and a 20M antenna used for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The Rosenstiel School's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS) and Richmond Satellite Operations Center (RSOC) have research facilities located on what is now named the Richmond Campus. ==Research== research catamaran utilized by RSMAS. As of 2008, RSMAS receives $50 million in annual external research funding. Laboratories at Virginia Key are equipped with specialized instruments including a salt-water wave tank, the five-tank Conditioning and Spawning Systems, multi-tank Aplysia Culture Laboratory, Controlled Corals Climate Tanks, and DNA analysis equipment. The Richmond Campus' CSTARS provides RSMAS with a near-real-time weather satellite downlink. The Rosenstiel School also operates the Bimini Biological Field Station, an array of oceanographic high- frequency radar along the US east coast, and the Bermuda aerosol observatory. Since 1977, the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a scientific partnership between UM and the NOAA, has been studying climate change, air-sea interactions and coastal ecology. Research projects at RSMAS are in the domain of atmospheric and marine sciences and include: *Coral reef research, focusing on corals survival in a new climate conditions; coral reef protection *Field programs evaluating trace gas chemistry and transport *The aquaculture program *Climate change modeling *Tropical weather, climate, and atmospheric/oceanic circulations *Air-sea interactions research through buoys, remote sensing, analysis in situ, a wave tank laboratory, numerical modeling; *Volcanoes in the Pacific, Everglades water level measurements and subsidence through satellite images *Studies of the coastal quality and the impact on human health. A satellite photo of Little Salt Spring. The field laboratory and dormitories are left of center; the dock over the water is used by research divers when excavating. RSMAS's Marine Affairs & Policy Division also conducts archaeological and paleontological research at Little Salt Spring in Sarasota County. The site was donated to the University of Miami in 1982. RSMAS also hosts the National Center for Coral Reef Research (NCORE), which works to understand, conserve and manage coral reefs worldwide. RSMAS has focused significant resources to studying the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its long term environmental effect. The school is an active member of the State of Florida's Oil Spill Academic Task Force that works with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on spill issues. In the summer of 2010, a CIMAS team working with the research vessel Walton Smith was able to document a long oil plume extending toward the Dry Tortugas. The quality of the school is evaluated through peer-reviewed competition for faculty research grants. In addition, each year, the National Science Foundation conduct a nationwide student competition for Graduate Research Award Fellowship, and in 2010, five RSMAS students received such awards with two additional honorable mentions. ==Notable faculty== * Frederick Bayer (Marine Biology) * Amy C.

The denier (; . d.) or penny was a medieval coin which takes its name from the Frankish coin first issued in the late seventh century; in English it is sometimes referred to as a silver penny. Its appearance represents the end of gold coinage, which, at the start of Frankish rule, had either been Byzantine or \\"pseudo-imperial\\" (minted by the Franks in imitation of Byzantine coinage). Silver would be the basis for Frankish coinage from then on. The denier was minted in France and parts of the Italian peninsula for the whole of the Middle Ages, in states such as the patriarchate of Aquileia, the Kingdom of Sicily, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Siena, and the crusader state Kingdom of Jerusalem, among others. ==History== ===Coin=== Around AD 755, amid the Carolingian Reforms, Pepin the Short introduced a new currency system which was eventually adjusted so that 12 pence (; ) equaled one shilling ('; ' or ') and 20 shillings equaled one pound (', ', or '; '). Later, three deniers equaled one liard. Only the denier was an actual coin; the rest were money of account. This system and the denier itself served as the model for many of Europe's currencies, including the British pound, Italian lira, Spanish dinero and the Portuguese dinheiro. ===Interest rates=== In Ancien R√©gime France, the denier was used as a notional measure of interest rates on loans. Thus, a rate of 4% (1/25) would be expressed as \\"denier 25\\"; a rate of 5% (1/20) as \\"denier 20\\"; and so forth. ==See also== *denarius *dinar *dinero *penny *pfennig ==References== Category:Coins of France Category:Medieval currencies Category:Economic history of France ","title":"French denier"},{"id":"1297816","text":"Mummerset is a fictional English dialect supposedly spoken in a rustic English county of the same name. Mummerset is used by actors to represent a stereotypical English West Country accent while not specifically referencing any particular county. The name is a portmanteau of mummer (an archaic term for a folk actor) and Somerset, a largely rural county. Mummerset draws on a mixture of characteristics of real dialects from the West Country, such as rhoticism, forward-shifted diphthongs, lengthened vowels, and the voicing of word-initial consonants that are voiceless in other English dialects. Word- initial \\"S\\" is replaced with \\"Z\\"; \\"F\\" is replaced with \\"V\\". It also uses perceived dialect grammar, replacing instances of \\"am\\", \\"are\\" and \\"is\\" with \\"be\\". The sentence \\"I haven't seen him, that farmer, since Friday\\" could be parsed in Mummerset as \\"Oi ain't zeen 'im that be varmer since Vroiday\\". Some speakers of East Anglian English have objected to media portrayals of characters from that area speaking in \\"a strange kind of stage Mummerset\\", as in the TV adaptation of P.D.

This is the group's first album for Bell Records, having switched from the Soul City Records label. The cover features an impressionistic portrait by famous artist LeRoy Neiman. The album languished in the mid-60s on the Billboard Top 200 Album Charts after the release of its first three singles, none of which entered the Top 20 of the American pop music charts. Bell Records, hoping to see a return on the investment they made by signing The 5th Dimension after the group's contract at Soul City Records ended, made a fourth and final attempt at a hit - a relatively uncommon practice at the time - with the release of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\". The single rose all the way to #2 by Christmas 1970, becoming one of the group's greatest hits of all time. As a result, Portrait began climbing the charts once again, eventually peaking at #20. The single features Marilyn McCoo on lead vocal, and ushers in The 5th Dimension's transition from pop to adult contemporary artists. McCoo from this point became the primary vocalist for the group's subsequent chart hits, including \\"Last Night (I Didn't Get to Sleep at All)\\", \\"Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes\\", \\"Never My Love\\", \\"If I Could Reach You\\", \\"House for Sale\\", \\"Everything's Been Changed\\" and \\"Flashback\\". This became a source of friction for the group as time went on, and was in part responsible for McCoo and husband Billy Davis, Jr. leaving the group after the release of Earthbound in 1975. ==Track listing== ;Side one #\\"Puppet Man\\" (Howard Greenfield, Neil Sedaka) ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"One Less Bell to Answer\\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) ‚Äì 3:31 #\\"Feelin' Alright?\\" (Dave Mason) ‚Äì 4:28 #\\"This Is Your Life\\" (Jimmy Webb) ‚Äì 4:13 #\\"A Love Like Ours\\" (Bob Alcivar, Lamonte McLemore) ‚Äì 2:39 ;Side two # * \\"Save the Country\\" (Laura Nyro) ‚Äì 2:39 #\\"Medley\\" ‚Äì 10:12 #*\\"The Declaration\\" (words are from the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the only known setting of it to music) (Julius Johnsen, Ren√© DeKnight) #*\\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" (Sam Cooke) #*\\"People Gotta Be Free\\" (Eddie Brigati, Felix Cavaliere) #\\"Dimension 5ive\\" (Bob Alcivar) ‚Äì 4:15 ;Bonus track # * \\"On the Beach (In the Summertime)\\" [*] (Landy McNeil) ‚Äì 3:28 *bonus track on CD ==Personnel== *Billy Davis, Jr. - lead vocals (tracks 3, 7), background vocals *Florence LaRue - lead vocals (tracks 1, 4), background vocals *Marilyn McCoo - lead vocals (tracks 1-2), background vocals *Lamonte McLemore - lead vocals (track 5), background vocals *Ron Townson - lead vocals (track 9), background vocals Additional personnel *Michael Anthony - electric guitar *Mike Deasy - electric guitar *Dennis Budimir - rhythm guitar *Tommy Tedesco - rhythm guitar *Fred Tackett - finger pickin' guitar *Joe Osborn - bass *Hal Blaine - drums, percussion *Larry Bunker - congas, mallets, percussion, drums *Gary Coleman - mallets, percussion *Larry Knechtel - piano, organ, tack piano *Jimmy Rowles - piano *Gary Illingworth - electric piano *Bob Alcivar - arranger ==Production== As mentioned on the liner notes of the album, this was one of the first albums to be recorded on a 16-track recorder, and was recorded at the Wally Heider Studios in Hollywood.

Sometimes it is a bet where money is involved. == Modern application == In the early 20th century, dead pools were popular in dangerous sports such as motorsport, for example the first edition of the Indianapolis 500. === Variants === A typical modern dead pool might have players pick out celebrities who they think will die within the year. Most games start on January 1 and run for 12 months, although there are some variations on game length and timing. In 2000, website Fucked Company claimed to be a \\"dot-com dead pool\\" which invited users to predict the next Internet startups to fail during that era's dot com bust. The site itself folded in 2007 after a long history as a target for strategic lawsuits against public participation by companies. Because of the high body count in the first seven seasons of the popular fantasy television series Game of Thrones, dead pools were launched for its final season. === Application in contemporary society === The Rotten.com Dead Pool, the largest in the world, uses NNDB as its source of qualified celebrities, and as arbiter of their life status. The concept and success strategies are also detailed in a (previously) annual guide called The Dead Pool, written by KQRS-FM radio personality Mike Gelfand and author Mike Wilkinson. KQRS-FM in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota also does an annual on air dead pool contest, where show hosts and listeners will attempt to pick which celebrity will die in that calendar year. In his AP news article \\"Some say death pools are in poor taste\\" (which brought national attention to The Old Blue Eyes Celebrity Death Watch), author Matt Sedensky writes, \\"Players scour newspapers and Web sites for news on celebrities' health; they rely on tips from insiders; and they consider a public figure's lifestyle, absence of recent appearances and rumors of illness.\\" ==In popular culture== A dead pool is a key plot element of the 1988 final installment of the Dirty Harry film series, The Dead Pool. Harry investigates the players, when several people listed in a game of dead pool die in suspicious circumstances. The Marvel Comics character Deadpool (first appearing in 1991) takes his name after escaping from Ajax and Dr. Killebrew, who formed their own dead pool based on which of their experimental subjects would die first. In the 2016 film Deadpool, the titular character takes his hero name from a dead pool of mercenaries, himself included, who are regular patrons at his favorite bar. In the MTV show Teen Wolf, the main plotline of Season 4 (2014) revolves around a dead pool specifically targeting the supernaturals of Beacon Hills, which is set up by a mysterious character named The Benefactor. ==See also== *Assassination market *Tontine == References == Category:Death Category:Gambling games Category:Prediction markets ","title":"Dead pool"},{"id":"1297858","text":"Snook, Snooks, or Snoek may refer to: == Fishes == * Family Centropomidae (snooks) ** Common snook * Family Esocidae (pikes) ** Haplochromis insidiae ** Northern pike * Family Gempylidae (snake mackerels) ** Blacksail snake mackerel or black snoek ** Thyrsites (this is the fish known in the United Kingdom during World War II as \\"snoek\\") * Family Muraenesocidae (pike congers) ** Pike eel * Family Percidae (perches) * Family Scombridae (mackerels, tunas, bonitos), subfamily: Scombrinae ** Kanadi kingfish ** Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus commerson * Barracuda ** Australian barracuda, Sphyraena novaehollandiae * Cutlassfish ** Silver scabbardfish * Petenia splendida, bay snook * Southern sennet, Sphyraena picudilla * Snook shark or Caribbean sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon porosus ==Places== ===United States=== * Rancho San Bernardo (Snook), a Mexican land grant in present-day San Diego County, California * Snook, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community * Snook, Texas, a city == People == ===Surname=== * Snoek (surname) * Frank Snook (born 1949), Major League Baseball player * Gary Snook (born 1947), Western Australian Legislative Assembly member * George Snook (1842‚Äì1894), President of the Chico Board of Trustees, the governing body of Chico, California from 1885 to 1886 and from 1892 to 1894 * Graeme Snooks (born 1944), Australian systems theorist * Hans Snoek (1910‚Äì2001), Dutch dancer and choreographer * Hans Snook (born 1948), German-Canadian businessman * Ian Snook (born 1950), New Zealand cricketer * James H.

Pahlavan and Salehi are the band's lead vocalists, and the songwriters are Pahlavan, Salehi, Amirkhas, Khahani and Farnejad. Their second, third and fourth albums were the bestselling albums of their release years. They are the first Iranian band to feature in the \\"International Who's Who in Music\\". They have released four albums, and played concerts around the globe. They donate part of their profits to the \\"United Nations World Food Programme\\". ==Albums== Their debut album, \\"Gole Aftabgardoon\\" (The Sunflower) was released in 2000. The album had huge success in Iran and between the Persian communities across the globe. The lyrics were simple, nice and different from the prior bands and singers, and the music had a positive feeling. Their second album, however, had more complex lyrics. It was named \\"Va Amma, Eshgh\\" (And Now, Love) and released in 2001. The lyrics were again alternative and different, and in the first song, the fantasies of love are being criticized and described as \\"The Childish Tales\\". It took three years to release the third album, Till Eternity..., released in 2004 and they started to show their music to the rest of the world and were nominated for BBC World Music awards recently. The band has become so popular that more than 54,000 tickets to one of their concerts were sold in less than six hours. In a recent interview with BBC they said, \\"Now we have a responsibility, we should be better and introduce ourselves all over the world. \\"If you go to Iranian movies all you see is misery - nothing else. People think Iran is like this - everything is a desert, all the people are crying.... We wanted to show the real Iran\\". In 2008, they released their fourth album \\"Bi to Ba to\\" and they worked together with Chris de Burgh and produced an English-Persian version of de Burgh's song \\"The Words I Love You\\" (A light for eternity).

It is levied by government or an airport management corporation and the proceeds are usually intended for funding of major airport improvements or expansion or airport service. Some airports do not levy these fees on connecting passengers who do not leave the airport or whose connecting flight is within a specific timeframe after they arrive. In the United States, the federal passenger facility charge (PFCs) program allows the collection of PFC fees up to $4.50 for every enplaned passenger at commercial airports controlled by public agencies. Airports use these fees to fund FAA-approved projects that enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce noise; or increase air carrier competition. Federal law limits use of PFC funds strictly to the above categories.Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) Depending on the location, the airport improvement fee is included in the cost of traveller's airline ticket, in which case the airline will forward the fee to proper agency. However, in some locations the fee must be paid at the point of embarkation. This often creates difficulties for departing passengers who are unfamiliar with this type of procedure, or for departing international passengers who have already exchanged all their local currency. The amount varies usually between US$10 and $30. In some instances, the fee continues to be charged long after construction has been completed (e.g. Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport). A legitimate reason for this is that the airport must finance the cost of the improvement and then pays off these costs over an extended period of time. Airports currently collecting an explicit airport improvement fee include: * Ministro Pistarini International Airport (Ezeiza), Buenos Aires, Argentina * Almost all Brazilian airports administered by Infraero * Almost all Canadian international airports * All airports in China * Ram√≥n Villeda Morales International Airport San Pedro Sula, Honduras * Indira Gandhi International Airport New Delhi, India * All airports in Indonesia (except on Garuda Indonesia domestic flight) * Ireland West Airport Knock, Knock, Republic of Ireland * Jorge Chavez International Airport Lima, Peru * Almost all public airports in the Philippines * Carrasco International Airport, Montevideo, Uruguay * Norwich International Airport, Norwich, United Kingdom * Newquay Cornwall Airport, Newquay, United Kingdom * All airports in Jamaica ==See also== *Air Passenger Duty, an excise charge levied on passengers departing the United Kingdom *German air passenger taxes *The Irish Air Travel Tax ==References== ==External links== Category:Civil aviation Category:Transfer tax Category:Aviation taxes ","title":"Airport improvement fee"},{"id":"1297881","text":"Sancho I may refer to: * Sancho I of Gascony (died 812), Basque Duke * Sancho I of Pamplona (circa 860‚Äì925), Navarrese monarch * Sancho I Ord√≥√±ez (circa 895‚Äì929), King of Galicia * Sancho I of Le√≥n (died 966), two-time King of Le√≥n * Sancho I of Aragon (c. 1042 ‚Äì 4 June 1094), second king of Aragon * Sancho I of Astarac (fl. 1050‚Äì1096/1119), count of Astarac * Sancho I of Portugal (1154‚Äì1212), King of Portugal ","title":"Sancho I"},{"id":"1297883","text":"In aviation air safety, a tombstone mentality informally is a pervasive attitude of ignoring design defects until people have died because of them.

The first Estonian rock-groups were primarily high school bands playing cover versions of the current UK Top 10. Despite the lack of official support from Soviet authorities (rock music was seen as undesirable Western influence) some of these groups, posing as dance music bands in various clubs, gained a large underground following. Some groups managed to make proper studio recordings and appear a couple of times on television. The most notable groups of the sixties were Juuniorid (the very first), Optimistid, Mikronid, Kontrastid and Virmalised. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as both rock and roll and the young Estonian musicians aged, the music became much more complex. Progressive rock, with hard rock influences, began to become more prevalent in Estonia. Musicians from the sixties, who continued their musical career either became established pop-stars or became interested in progressive rock. So called progressive or intellectual rock could be an indulgence, a way to prove the Soviet authorities that rock music could have a deeper meaning. Because of the lack of proper gear some young engineers like H√§rmo H√§rm started to make equipment like synthesizers for rock bands. During the seventies Estonian bands began touring in the Soviet Union, some of them becoming quite popular. The first EPs and LPs were released under the Melodiya label. The most notable groups of the seventies were Ruja, Gunnar Graps Group, Meie, In Spe and Apelsin. The early eighties saw the rise of punk rock in Estonia. This rise could be described as back to the basics. Much like early Estonian rock music was a copy of the UK Top 10 back in the sixties, the new Estonian punk music was highly influenced by UK77 and UK82 raw punk rock. American bands were unreachable. And like rock music in the sixties punk rock was highly disliked by the Soviet authorities. Besides punk rock, the Estonian rock scene in the eighties had its own answer to everything that was going on in the free world - heavy metal, new romantics, and synthpop. However, there was a few years of delay between the Estonian scene and the rest of the world. Despite this, Estonia remained a step ahead of the rest of the Soviet Union and during the perestroika period a few underground bands like J.M.K.E. and R√∂√∂vel √ñ√∂bik became well known in Finland. The most notable bands of the 1980s were: Generator M, Radar, Rock Hotel, Vitamiin, J.M.K.E., and Singer Vinger. The nineties saw the fall of music and musicians from previous decades. Youth, looking for something new as usual, got the first taste of electronic. In the early 1990s there were simultaneous small-scale outbreaks of indie rock and metal. A punk survivor from the 1980s - Vennaskond saw mainstream popularity and gained a large following, becoming arguably the most influential Estonian rock band ever. The late 1990s were the lowpoint of the Estonian rock scene. Acts from the first half of the decade continued with minor success, and no new big acts appeared. The most notable bands of the nineties were: Vennaskond, Terminaator, The Tuberkuloited, Blind, Smilers and Psychoterror. The new millennium has seen the slow but continuous rise of rock music. Currently strong metal and indie scenes exist, and Estonia has one of the highest rates of metal bands per capita in the world. ==Estonian rock artists and bands== == External links == *Estonianmetal.com Overview of Estonian metal bands, releases, news and other events Category:Estonian music Estonia ","title":"Rock music in Estonia"},{"id":"1297904","text":"Boricua College is a private college in New York City. The college was designed to serve the education needs of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics and was founded by Victor G. Alicea and several others. ==Faculty== The school employs a largely bilingual faculty and staff of 130 full-time and 100 part- time members. According to its Self Study Report (2014) to the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, in fall 2012-13 it had 59.5 full-time faculty and 25 part-time adjunct faculty. Over 90% are Latinos. It serves a student population of 1,200. ==Campuses== Williamsburg Boricua College Tower in The Bronx The college has four campuses: Washington Heights, Manhattan; in North Williamsburg, Brooklyn; in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and in the Bronx. ==Accreditation== Boricua College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In the spring of 2014 the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC/CAEP) evaluated Boricua College's Audit Brief and recommended it \\"above standard\\" for TEAC's three quality principles: Candidate Learning, Faculty Learning, and Capacity and Commitment of the institution. TEAC/CAEP met and accepted the recommendation and accredited, for the maximum allowable of seven years (spring 2014 to spring 2021), the college's Bachelor of Science degree program in Childhood Education that included the Generic Studies Liberal Arts and Sciences core curriculum program, and the Masters in Science degree program in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). This national achievement complements the authorization of these programs by the New York State Education Department and the State Certification of the graduates. ==Student body and graduation== The college is regarded as \\"nontraditional\\" because of its competency-based model of education, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking skills and clarification of values and increasing students' capacity for self-reflection. Its student body is 79% adult (over 25 years old with family responsibilities) which puts it in the nontraditional category. In his book Access to Freedom, James Hall considered Boricua College as a nontraditional college. Hall explains that these colleges cater to adult, working students who may take much longer than the six years taken by traditional students to graduate.James Hall, Access to Freedom, 1993, p. 117. Boricua College's graduation rate is given by the National Center for Educational Statistics (a resource generally used by US Department of Education's office of statistics) to be 54% among first-time college students who entered in 2006 and graduated in 2012. When students who transfer out to other colleges are taken into account, that positive completion rate is given by the National Center as 69%. Further, during the last 10 years the college's education department has program completers who pass the New York State certification examinations at more than the required 80% rate. ===Notable alumni=== *Boricua College counts New York State Assemblyman F√©lix Ortiz, a Democrat representing the 51st Assembly District, as one of its alumni. *Robert Torres (known by the stage name Sabor Latino), a Hip Hop artist and author, is an alumnus of Boricua College. ==Notable visitors== In January 2000 President Bill Clinton visited the Brooklyn campus at its Graham Avenue learning center to inaugurate a Small Business Association at the college.

It is the centrepiece of the Mayfair property of the Duke of Westminster, and takes its name from the surname \\"Grosvenor\\". The unique floor plans, detailed elevations, 3D fa√ßade model for the building was done by Michael Gallie. ==History== The north side of Grosvenor Square in the 18th or early 19th century. The three houses at the far left form a unified group, but the others on this side are individually designed. Most later London squares would be more uniform. Sir Richard Grosvenor obtained a licence to develop Grosvenor Square and the surrounding streets in 1710, and development took place between 1725 and 1731. The land was sold in individual plots, with 30 different builders or partnerships taking a lease; about half of these had become bankrupt by 1738. Grosvenor Square was one of the three or four most fashionable residential addresses in London from its construction until the Second World War, with numerous leading members of the aristocracy in residence. The early houses were generally of five or seven bays, with basement, three main stories and an attic. Some attempt was made to produce impressive groupings of houses, and Colen Campbell produced a design for a palatial east side to the square featuring thirty Corinthian columns but this was not carried out and in the end most of the houses were built to individual designs. There were mews behind all four sides. Many of the houses were rebuilt later in the 18th century or during the 19th century, generally acquiring an extra storey when this happened. Number 23 (later 26) was rebuilt in 1773‚Äì74 for the 11th Earl of Derby by Robert Adam, and is regarded as one of the architect's finest works and as a seminal example of how grandeur of effect and sophisticated planning might be achieved on a confined site. It was demolished and rebuilt again in the 1860s. Nearly all of the older houses were demolished during the 20th century and replaced with blocks of flats in a neo-Georgian style, hotels and embassies. The garden Providing almost 2.5 hectares of open garden Grosvenor Square is the second largest garden square in central London after Russel Square at 2.5 hectares. While Lincoln's Inn Field at 4.5 hectares is a larger space it is categorised as an Inn of Court, not a Garden Square. Originally laid out by gardener John Alston in the 1720s his ‚Äòwilderness worke‚Äô design was a celebration of the countryside in the city, however the gardens have been modified over time to meet the changing needs of those around it. Reserved for resident‚Äôs use for much of its life, the Grade II registered landscape was made a public space for everyone‚Äôs enjoyment after World War Two through the Roosevelt Memorial Act. It was then managed by the Royal Parks until 2018, when Grosvenor Britain & Ireland took over its management. Following an international Call for Ideas in 2018 , Grosvenor confirmed that the square would be redesigned to enhance its contribution to the environment and local communities. Architects Tonkin Liu were appointed in 2020 to lead the re-design. ===Bentley Boys of the 1920s=== In the 1920s, four of the \\"Bentley Boys\\" ‚Äì Woolf Barnato, Tim Birkin, Glen Kidston and Bernard Rubin ‚Äì took adjacent flats in the fashionable south- east corner of the square, where their day-long parties became something of social legend. So common was the sight of their large, green sports cars parked ad hoc outside their flats, that for many years London cab drivers referred to the spot as \\"Bentley Corner\\". === American presence === Macdonald House, used as the U.S. Embassy from 1938 to 1960, shown in 2009 during its use as the High Commission of Canada from 1961 to 2014. Grosvenor Square has been the traditional home of the official American presence in London since John Adams established the first American mission to the Court of St. James's in 1785. Adams lived, from 1785 to 1788, in the house which still stands on the corner of Brook and Duke Streets. During the Second World War Dwight D. Eisenhower established a military headquarters at 20 Grosvenor Square, and during this time the square was nicknamed \\"Eisenhower Platz\\". Until 2009, the United States Navy continued to use this building as its headquarters for United States Naval Forces Europe. A statue of Franklin D. Roosevelt sculpted by Sir William Reid Dick stands in the square, as does a later statue of Eisenhower and a still later one of Ronald Reagan. The square also contains the Eagle Squadrons Memorial. The former United States Embassy of 1938‚Äì1960 on the square was purchased by the Canadian government and renamed Macdonald House. It was part of the Canadian High Commission in London until 2014, when all the functions of the Canadian High Commission were transferred to Canada House in Trafalgar Square. American Embassy (1960‚Äì2018) on the western side of Grosvenor Square In 1960, a new United States Embassy was built on the western side of Grosvenor Square. This was a large and architecturally significant modern design by Eero Saarinen but at the time it was a controversial insertion into a mainly Georgian and neo-Georgian district of London. In March and October 1968, there were large demonstrations in the square against US involvement in the Vietnam War. On both occasions, the protest became violent. After 2001 a series of anti-terrorist devices were installed around the embassy, and the road running along the front of the building has been closed completely to traffic. In 2006, the Grosvenor Square Safety Group residents association took out advertisements in The Washington Post and The Times, accusing the Metropolitan Police and local government of a \\"moral failure\\" for not closing two other roads adjacent to the embassy. In 2008, the United States Government chose a site for a new embassy in the Nine Elms area of the London Borough of Wandsworth, south of the River Thames. Construction of the new Embassy of the United States in London began in 2013, with relocation completed by 2017. In October 2009, following a recommendation by English Heritage, the building was granted Grade II listed status. The listing means that the new owners will not be allowed to change the facade, which includes the 35-foot-wingspread gilded-aluminium eagle that hovers above the main entrance. In November 2009, the Grosvenor Square property was purchased by the Qatari Diar investment group. === Adlai Stevenson === On 14 July 1965, while walking with Marietta Tree, the then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson, suffered a heart attack, later dying at the old St George's Hospital at Hyde Park Corner. As they reached the front of the Sportsman's Club, his last words were reportedly to ask her to slow down. ===Oscar Wilde=== The writer Oscar Wilde lived in Grosvenor Square between 1883 and 1884 and references to the square appear in four of his works (see section below). ===Memorial to victims of 11 September, 2001=== Since 2003 the east of the gardens has a memorial garden to 67 British victims of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Grosvenor Square Memorial Garden The poem For Katrina's Sun-Dial by Henry van Dyke was chosen for inscription on an elliptical granite block engraved with the names of the victims, underneath which is buried a piece of the steel wreckage. 11 September 2001 memorial garden === Diplomatic property sell-off === The former United States Navy building at 20 Grosvenor Square was sold in 2007 for ¬£250 million to Richard Caring, who planned to turn it into 41 residential apartments. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council and property developer Finchatton then bought the building for the same amount in April 2013, with planning permission to convert the building into 31 luxury apartments. In September 2013, the Government of Canada announced its intention to sell its High Commission building at 1 Grosvenor Square and \\"consolidate its diplomatic activity in the UK in a single, central location in Canada House on Trafalgar Square\\".. ==Notable buildings== Most of the buildings on Grosvenor Square are in the Georgian style of architecture. * No. 1 ‚Äì Macdonald House, formerly part of the High Commission of Canada, being redeveloped into high-end residences * No. 4 ‚Äì Back entrance to the Embassy of Italy * No. 10 ‚Äì London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square * No. 20 ‚Äì Former United States Navy building, being converted into upscale apartments20 Grosvenor Square * No. 24 ‚Äì Eero Saarinen-designed former location of the Embassy of the United States, being redeveloped by Rosewood Hotels into a luxury hotel designed by David Chipperfield24 Grosvenor Square * No. 38 ‚Äì Former Embassy of Indonesia, converted by Venue Lab into an event space * No. 44 ‚Äì The Biltmore Mayfair hotel, formerly the Millennium Hotel London Mayfair == In popular culture == *Robert Hunter's lyrics for the Grateful Dead song Scarlet Begonias begin with the line \\"As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square\\". *It appears in the title of several novels including The Lonely Lady of Grosvenor Square by Mrs. Henry De La Pasture (1907), The Grosvenor Square Goodbye by Francis Clifford (1978), and The House in Grosvenor Square by Linore Rose Burkard (2009). *In Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens the Barnacles are said to live at \\"four Mews Street Grosvenor\\" which \\"was not absolutely Grosvenor Square itself but it was very near it\\". *In the 1960 Universal Pictures thriller Midnight Lace, Doris Day is terrorized in Grosvenor Square as she leaves the U.S. Embassy at 1 Grosvenor Square during a London ‚Äúpea- soup‚Äù fog.

Similarly, immunisation can be used to ensure that the value of a pension fund's or a firm's assets will increase or decrease in exactly the opposite amount of their liabilities, thus leaving the value of the pension fund's surplus or firm's equity unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate. Interest rate immunisation can be accomplished by several methods, including cash flow matching, duration matching, and volatility and convexity matching. It can also be accomplished by trading in bond forwards, futures, or options. Other types of financial risks, such as foreign exchange risk or stock market risk, can be immunised using similar strategies. If the immunisation is incomplete, these strategies are usually called hedging. If the immunisation is complete, these strategies are usually called arbitrage. ==Cash flow matching== Conceptually, the easiest form of immunisation is cash flow matching. For example, if a financial company is obliged to pay 100 dollars to someone in 10 years, it can protect itself by buying and holding a 10-year, zero-coupon bond that matures in 10 years and has a redemption value of $100. Thus, the firm's expected cash inflows would exactly match its expected cash outflows, and a change in interest rates would not affect the firm's ability to pay its obligations. Nevertheless, a firm with many expected cash flows can find that cash flow matching can be difficult or expensive to achieve in practice. That meant that only institutional investors could afford it. But the latest advances in technology have relieved much of this difficulty. Dedicated portfolio theory is based on cash flow matching and is being used by personal financial advisors to construct retirement portfolios for private individuals. Withdrawals from the portfolio to pay living expenses represent the stream of expected future cash flows to be matched. Individual bonds with staggered maturities are purchased whose coupon interest payments and redemptions supply the cash flows to meet the withdrawals of the retirees. ==Duration matching== A more practical alternative immunisation method is duration matching. Here, the duration of the assets is matched with the duration of the liabilities. To make the match actually profitable under changing interest rates, the assets and liabilities are arranged so that the total convexity of the assets exceed the convexity of the liabilities. In other words, one can match the first derivatives (with respect to interest rate) of the price functions of the assets and liabilities and make sure that the second derivative of the asset price function is set to be greater than or equal to the second derivative of the liability price function. == Calculating immunisation == Immunisation starts with the assumption that the yield curve is flat. It then assumes that interest rate changes are parallel shifts up or down in that yield curve. Let the net cash flow at time t be denoted by R_t, i.e.: : R_t = A_t - L_t \\\\text{ for } t = 1,2,3,\\\\ldots,n where A_t and L_t represent cash inflows and outflows or liabilities respectively. Assuming that the present value of cash inflows from the assets is equal to the present value of the cash outflows from the liabilities, then: : P(i) = 0 The Theory of Interest, Stephen G. Kellison, McGraw Hill International,2009 ==Immunisation in practice== Immunisation can be done in a portfolio of a single asset type, such as government bonds, by creating long and short positions along the yield curve. It is usually possible to immunize a portfolio against the most prevalent risk factors. A principal component analysis of changes along the U.S. Government Treasury yield curve reveals that more than 90% of the yield curve shifts are parallel shifts, followed by a smaller percentage of slope shifts and a very small percentage of curvature shifts. Using that knowledge, an immunized portfolio can be created by creating long positions with durations at the long and short end of the curve, and a matching short position with a duration in the middle of the curve. These positions protect against parallel shifts and slope changes, in exchange for exposure to curvature changes. ==Difficulties== Immunisation, if possible and complete, can protect against term mismatch but not against other kinds of financial risk such as default by the borrower (i.e., the issuer of a bond). It might also be difficult to find assets with suitable cashflow structures that are necessary to ensure a particular level of overall volatility of assets to have a proper match with that of liabilities. Once there is a change in interest rate, the entire portfolio has to be restructured to immunise it again. Such a process of continuous restructuring of portfolios makes immunisation a costly and tedious task. Users of this technique include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and bond brokers; individual investors infrequently have the resources to properly immunise their portfolios. The disadvantage associated with duration matching is that it assumes the durations of assets and liabilities remain unchanged, which is rarely the case. ==History== Immunisation was discovered independently by several researchers in the early 1940s and 1950s. This work was largely ignored before being re-introduced in the early 1970s, whereafter it gained popularity.

He is the namesake of the Shekhawati region, comprising the districts of Sikar, Churu and Jhunjhunu in the modern Indian state of Rajasthan. His descendants are known as the \\"Shekhawat\\" . ==Birth== On Mokal's Death in AD 1445, the twelve year old Shekha Succeeded his father's estates at Amarsar. His parents are said to have sought prayers of intercession from the Muslim pir Sheikh Burhan, after whom Shekha was named . In due time, Sheikh Burhan fathered an heir, who according to the injunctions of Burhan, was styled after his own tribe, Shekh. He directed that the child should wear a buddea (strings or threads) which, when laid aside, was to be suspended at the saint's durgah; and further, that he should assume the blue tunic and cap, abstain from hog's flesh and eat no meat \\"in which the blood remained\\". He also ordained that at the birth of every Shekhawat male infant a goat should be sacrificed, while for female infants nothing special would need to happen. These obligations were religiously maintained for over two hundred years. ==Coronation== Shekha succeeded as the head of the Nayan and Barwada estate, along with 24 more villages, at the age of 12, as a result of the untimely death of his father Mokal Ji in 1445. ==Life== When Shekha inherited his father's estate, his reputation and power attracted the jealousy of the Lord Paramount of Amber. He was attacked, but thanks to the aid of the Punnee Pathans he successfully withstood the reiterated assaults of his suzerain lord. Up to this period they had acknowledged the Amber princes as liege lords, and in token of the alliance paid as tribute all the colts reared on the original estate. A dispute on this point was the ostensible cause (though subordinate to their rapid prosperity) of intermittent separations of the Shekhawat colonies from the parent state, which lasted until the reign of Sawai Jai Singh, who brought submission and pecuniary relief from them. Shekha left a well-established position to his youngest son Raimal.. After Raimal , Rao Lunkaran was made the Head of Amarsar. After is Death, the Ancestral seat of Amarsar was succeeded by his Son Rao Manohar. Later Shahpura, became the capital of Old Amarsar - Manoharpur line of Shekhawats. ==Death== Shekha died in 1488 fighting the Gaur Rajputs in the war of Ghatwa defending the modesty and self-respect of a newlywed lady. Shekha took his last breath at Ralawta. A cenotaph (Chhatri) was built where he died. A statue of Shekha was also inaugurated in the same place by the President of India Smt. Pratibha Patil.

Starting out as a spinoff of the Compati Hero series, the main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. The first game in the franchise was released for the Game Boy on April 20, 1991. Later spawning numerous games that were released on various consoles and handhelds. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016. ==Games== Most are standalone games, whose background stories may involve the plots of the included series, but no other Super Robot Wars titles. However, there are at least five main continuities with a single overall storyline encompassing all of them: ;Classic :Consists of the 2nd, the 3rd, EX, F and F Final games (in that order). F and F Final replaced the 4th, while 2G is not considered canon, due to its non-inclusion in the Complete Box set. The side-story Mas≈ç Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental is divided into two parts: \\"Part One\\" occurs before the 2nd and \\"Part Two\\" after the 4th (4th was released before F and F Final). The primary antagonist organization of this series is known as DC (Divine Crusaders). ;Masou Kishin :Consists of Gaiden: Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental, OG Saga: Masou Kishin 2 - Revelation of Evil God, OG Saga: Masou Kishin 3 - Pride of Justice and Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Masou Kishin F ‚Äì Coffin of the End (in that order). Gaiden: Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental for the SFC was ported as a remake for the NDS (with a series first use of the OG Saga prefix replacing Gaiden.) and later as a remake of that DS version in a limited edition bundle with part 2 of this series, named OG Saga: Masou Kishin I & II, for the PSP. The last two titles in this series were released for the PS3 (the former also was ported to the PS Vita). ;Alpha :Consists of Alpha, Alpha Gaiden, Alpha 2 and Alpha 3 games (in that order). \\"Part One\\" of Mas≈ç Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental also provides relevant information, taking place before Alpha. ;Compact :Consists of Compact, Compact 2 and Compact 3 games for the Wonderswan (in that order). The first series game on WS Compact was remade as Compact for WonderSwan Color for the Wonderswan Color. Compact 2 was released as three chapters for the WonderSwan; the trilogy was later compiled with updated visuals, sound and new content as Impact for the PS2. ;Impact :Consists of Impact and MX games for the PS2. Previously, Compact 2 was released as three chapters for the WonderSwan; the trilogy was later compiled with updated visuals, sound and new content as Impact for the PS2. Despite the sharing of gameplay mechanics between all of the Wonderswan games, and the similarities between Impact and MX, Compact 2 and Impact are not tied to any other games in the series. MX for the PS2 is seen as a direct sequel to Impact as it reuses several of the same series of the latter and has similar gameplay elements and much of its soundtrack remixed from the one in Impact. MX was ported to the PSP with minor adjustments and additions. ;Original Generation :This series does not feature any manga or anime characters at all, instead starring the \\"Banpresto Originals\\", original characters made specifically for previous games in the series. This timeline draws upon from all previous continuities. Both Original Generation games for the GBA which were released in the US, were compiled with updated visuals and sound as Super Robot Wars Original Generations, followed by the sequel Super Robot Wars Original Generation Gaiden, the remake version of Mas≈ç Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental, Mas≈ç Kishin 2: Revelation of Evil God, 2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generation, Mas≈ç Kishin 3: Pride of Justice, Mas≈ç Kishin F: Coffin of The End and Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Moon Dwellers. Also part of the Original Generation series is the Endless Frontier series, composing of Endless Frontier and Endless Frontier EXCEED, which is set after Original Generation Gaiden. This continuity is the only one to have had titles officially released in the West. The Moon Dwellers is one of the first in the series that has an English translation for the Japanese market. ;Z :This continuity consists of Z, Z Special Disk, Z2, and Z3 in that order. The story focuses on the Twelve Spheres, which play an important part in the game's story line. This timeline is well-known for introducing an extremely large amount of debuting series, on a scale that previous SRW titles have never reached. In addition, Z3 was the first SRW game to have HD sprites. ;International Era :Consists of V, X, and T. This continuity was is commonly named this due to SRW V being the first mainline game to receive official translation and release outside of Japan. Using the engine utilized in Z3, these three games are independent of each other plot-wise. ;Mobile Games :Consists of X-Omega and DD. X-Omega is a departure from SRW's usual turn- based strategy formula, and is more similar to a defense-type game, where units are placed and commanded to defend against invading enemies. It is known to have an extremely large number of debuting series, and also have non-mecha anime crossovers. :DD returns to the usual SRW turn-based strategy formula, and battles are much more reminiscient of normal SRW games. However, players are only allowed to deploy 4 of their own units at a time, and instead of mechs being pulled from the gacha, attacks are instead. ==Recurring elements== ===Story=== In most games, the player selects or is given a Banpresto original character and machine, who is connected to the overarching storyline which ties together the events of the constituent anime for the game. Some featured anime also has their plots intertwined: in Super Robot Wars Alpha, the White Fang from New Mobile Report Gundam Wing allies with Paptimus Scirocco's rebellion from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, resulting in the two enemy forces working together. The stories play out the events of the anime, albeit altered. It is said that the events of each game are caused by incursions known as Dimension Quakes that started several years prior with the explosion of a \\"dimensional bomb\\", thereby constantly merging and separating the various universes without anyone knowing, ensuring canonicity. ===Gameplay=== Battles in Super Robot Wars are turn-based. The player usually gets to move their forces first, one at a time, then control switches to the game's AI. When a unit attacks, the target reacts by blocking (increasing defense against the attack), evading (reducing the attack's chance to hit), or countering (striking back with their own attack). Once chosen, the battle animation is played out. If the player unit is not destroyed and successfully damaged the enemy, then the unit gains experience points. All battles are carried out either the terrain of land, air, sea or space, which affects the performance of machines, pilots and weapons in various ways. The battlefield also contains objects which grant various effects. For example, besides providing repair and energy refill, a military base also provides land units with defense bonus but will hinder them from moving freely. In addition to standard mecha and vehicle units, the player often has one or more \\"Battleships\\", air- or spacecraft units that in addition to powerful long-ranged attacks, can also dock other units to refill energy, repair damage. Units in-game are generally separated into two categories: \\"super-type\\" and \\"real-type\\". Super robots are heavy units with exceptionally high hit points and armor, and powerful, close-range weapons with high energy cost. On the other hand, real robots are light units which are faster and more agile, but have less armor and hit points, relying instead on dodging attacks. Their weapons have longer range and better accuracy at the cost of doing less damage per hit. Some units are treated as \\"support units\\", regenerating hit points and/or energy to allies, while battleships and carriers serve as transports or to resupply all units, while also providing powerful fire support. Though every unit takes a single grid on the tactical map and has little visual difference in battle animations, a larger unit gains defensive and offensive bonus against smaller units, but carry a disadvantage to evasion and accuracy. In later titles, certain attacks can bypass the size attribute, nullifying the effect of size in combat. Some units have other unique characteristics: for example, Getter Robo can transform into different forms with new weapons and different attributes. Weapons carry various attributes other than range, accuracy modifier and attack power. All weapons can be divided into melee and shooting categories that determine its effectiveness by pilots' status. Other attributes can be affected by terrain or a target's defensive ability. In addition, some units make use of \\"MAP Weapons\\" which affect multiple squares at once, with some damaging everything in the area and others, such as Cybuster's Cyflash, ignoring allies. Some games feature weapons which inflict status effects on enemies that drain their energy, weaken their armor or damage the pilot's stats. ==History== ===Origins and development=== In 1990, Japanese video game developer Banpresto released SD Battle ≈åzum≈ç: Heisei Hero Basho, the debut entry in its Compati Hero series, for the Family Computer (Famicom). A crossover between \\"super deformed\\" versions of Kamen Rider, Ultraman, and Mobile Suit Gundam, it was created as a congratulatory gift for Yukimasa Sugiura, who at the time had been promoted president of Banpresto. SD Battle ≈åzum≈ç enjoyed a commercial success in Japan, prompting Banpresto to create a more mature-oriented successor, Super Robot Wars, for the Game Boy in 1991. The original game borrowed several concepts from SD Battle ≈åzum≈ç, most notably its usage of characters from other Japanese entertainment properties. Its creation was also in part due to the popularity of both the Game Boy and Famicom in Japan, which continued to dominate the Japanese video game market. Banpresto turned the concept of Super Robot Wars into a franchise following its commercial success, beginning with 2nd Super Robot Wars several months later for the Famicom. Banpresto outsourced development of earlier Super Robot Wars games to Japanese studio Winkysoft. Beginning with Super Robot Wars Complete Box in 1999, the company moved production in-house, with Banpresto's consumer game division Banpresoft handling development of future installments. Sugiura intended for 4th Super Robot Wars to be the final entry, however the franchise's lasting popularity prompted the creation of further sequels to meet demand. The company placed Takanobu Terada in the role of series producer; he at first showed little interest in its super-deformed character designs and gameplay structure. As Super Robot Wars sequels added more original character designs and its scope expanded, Terada showed more appreciation and embraced his role. Sugiura hoped the series could help introduce its players to the anime and manga series featured in each installment, commenting that he hoped it would \\"sell more and more for 20 years\\". In 2005, Banpresto's parent company Bandai merged with Namco, creating Namco Bandai Holdings and subsequently Namco Bandai Games. Banpresto became a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Holdings in 2006, where it continued to develop Super Robot Wars games in addition to other projects. On April 1, 2008, Banpresto's video game operations were absorbed by Namco Bandai Games, with Banpresto being reorganized into a toy and prize machine developer. Terada and other Banpresto employees were transferred to Namco Bandai Games, as the company assuming control of the property. In 2011, Banpresoft and BEC (Bandai Entertainment Company) merged to form B.B. Studio, a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Games that would handle further production of the series. ===Localization=== Many mecha titles included are released only in Japan and the number of titles involved within a single game means complicated rights and licensing issues when releasing it elsewhere. Thus far, only Original Generation games are officially released for the English market by Atlus USA. The titles of the games are given as Super Robot Taisen. The games do not have the licensing problems other games may have since only original creations not from any anime or manga series are used in the lineup, thus making it the first game in the series to be released outside of the Asian market. Atlus also released Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier for the Nintendo DS on April 28, 2009. In early 2016, Bandai Namco have announced that Super Robot Wars OG: Moon Dwellers and Super Robot Wars V will be given an English release for the Southeastern Asian version along with a Chinese translation. In December 2017, Bandai Namco announced that Super Robot Wars X would be released in English for Southeast Asia market in 2018. In November 2018, Bandai Namco announced that Super Robot Wars T will be released in English for Southeast Asian market in 2019. ==Reception and sales== As of April 2014, the Super Robot Wars series has exceeded 16 million copies across all platforms. The debut entry sold a combined 190,000 units and became a best-seller for the Game Boy during its first few weeks on the market. The best-selling entry is Super Robot Wars Œ± on the PlayStation, having sold over 715,000 copies by 1998. Super Robot Wars games have become consistent best-sellers for both Banpresto and Bandai Namco, having regularly appeared on top sales charts in Japan as late as 2019. Ollie Bardner, a writer for Eurogamer, described Super Robot Wars as \\"one of Japan's most enduring mecha series\\", showing appreciation towards its turn-based gameplay and large roster of mecha series and characters. Bardner believes part of the franchise's success is introducing its players to older mecha anime series: \\"Originally intended as a mere mecha anime crossover vehicle, Super Robot Wars has become something else. Not only has it facilitated new generations of gamers to discover brilliant anime from times long past, but also birthed unique games and anime in their own right.\\" USgamers Kat Bailey stated that the series serves as an \\"extremely faithful tribute\\" to the mecha genre and its history, writing that it \\"beautifully [remixes] everything from Mobile Suit Gundam to Voltron.\\" The games' main influence is the creation of animated shows influenced by original units and characters created for the games. The best examples are Getter Robo Armageddon, Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo and the Mazinkaiser OVA, released in the United States in 2002. Shin Getter Robo first appeared in Ken Ishikawa's manga for Getter Robo Go, then became by its apparition in various Super Robot Wars games until receiving its aforementioned OVAs. Mazinkaiser appeared for the first time in Super Robot Wars F Final, released for the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation in 1998, as an upgrade to the original Mazinger Z in order to allow the Mazinger franchise to compete with other super robots such as Shin Getter Robo. Mazinger Z writer and illustrator, Go Nagai, eventually implements it into his manga as the prototype of the other Mazinger machines, and the aforementioned OVA was also created. ==Related media== ===Music=== JAM Project, consisting of veteran anime theme musicians, like Hironobu Kageyama, Rica Matsumoto, Eizo Sakamoto, Masaaki Endoh, Hiroshi Kitadani, Masami Okui and Yoshiki Fukuyama have also contributed to many Super Robot Wars soundtracks, usually providing the opening theme song and the song played over the closing credits. The series also spawned a set of concerts and albums called \\"Super Robot Spirits\\", where veteran vocalists‚Äîsome of whom would go on to form JAM Project‚Äîsing covers of popular mecha anime openings, and in some cases, live versions of songs they themselves originally sang. ===Anime=== Mas≈ç Kishin Cybuster is a loose adaptation on the story of the first original Banpresto mecha in Super Robot Wars into a 26-episode series, featuring characters inspired by the allies of the Cybuster's pilot Masaki Andoh and original characters created for the anime. In May 2005, Banpresto released the animated OVA Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Animation, a 3-part non-canonical sequel to the second Original Generation game. In 2006, the OVA was followed up by Super Robot Wars Original Generation: Divine Wars, a retelling of the plot in the first Original Generation game. A variety of drama CDs, manga and model kits accompany the Original Generation lineup. In Fall 2010, Banpresto followed up with Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Inspector, which is a retelling of the plot of Original Generation 2. ===Manga=== There have been several Manga adaptations that retell the stories of the Super Robot Wars series. by Akihiro Kimura tells the story of the Divine Wars anime over 6 volumes published from 2006 to 2009. Meanwhile, is manga series by Tatsunosuke Yatsufusa that tells a similar story but from the ATX Team's perspective. is a series of short stories that take place across the Original Generation timeline, written and drawn by various authors, some of the stories from OG Chronicle were incorporated into the video game Super Robot Wars Original Generation Gaiden. , is a 2 volume series by Masaaki Fujihara tells the background story for the original machines known as the Chokijin. ===Net Radio=== began to air to go along with the release of the Divine Wars anime. The show has been airing since January 2007 with four regular hosts, Tomokazu Sugita, Masaaki Endoh, Mai Aizawa and Rie Saitou. The show often features series' producer Takanobu Terada as a special guest. After Divine Wars ended, the show carried on and was often used to regularly feature and promoted up and coming video game titles. ==See also== * List of Japanese role-playing game franchises ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Banpresto's official SRW site *SRW's Official Blog Category:Atlus games Category:Bandai Namco Entertainment franchises Category:Banpresto games Category:Crossover video games Category:Dengeki Comics Category:Ken Ishikawa Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video game franchises Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1991 Category:Winkysoft games ","title":"Super Robot Wars"},{"id":"1297949","text":"Watauga can refer to: ;Places *Watauga, Kentucky * Watauga County, North Carolina * Watauga, South Dakota * Watauga, Tennessee * Watauga, Texas ;Bodies of Water * Watauga Lake in Tennessee * The Watauga River in North Carolina and Tennessee ;Ships * USS Watauga (1864), a steam frigate planned for the United States Navy during the American Civil War that was never built ;Other * The Watauga Association, a pre-revolutionary autonomous American government * The Watauga Democrat, a newspaper published in Boone, North Carolina * Watauga College, a residential college at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina * The Watauga Dam, on the Watauga and Elk Rivers in Carter County, Tennessee ","title":"Watauga"},{"id":"1297952","text":"Paul Phillips may refer to: *Paul Phillips (baseball) (born 1977), Major League Baseball catcher *Paul Phillips (guitarist) (born 1975), lead guitarist for the band Puddle of Mudd *Paul Phillips (songwriter/singer), English singer-songwriter *Paul Phillips (poker player) (born 1972), American software engineer, entrepreneur and poker player *Paul Phillips (conductor) (born 1956), American conductor, composer and music scholar *Paul Phillips (bodhran) (1959‚Äì2007), Irish bodhr√°n player and teacher *Paul Phillips, pilot of DHL Flight 611, which crashed into Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937 in mid-air *Paul Phillips, solicitor to Lamin Fhimah in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial *Paul Phillips, principal of Weston College ","title":"Paul Phillips"},{"id":"1297959","text":"Israeli rock (, Rok Yisra'eli) is rock music created by Israeli bands and singers. ==History== ===The development of Israeli rock in the 1960s=== Rock singer Shalom Hanoch Israel's initial attitude toward rock music was extremely negative. Israeli musicians of the time believed that it was a trend that would soon pass. The first Israeli rock bands began performing in the mid-1960s in nightclubs and discos, first in Ramla and later on HaMasger Street in Tel Aviv.From margins to mainstream, Haaretz These bands mainly performed cover versions of popular rock songs by bands like The Beatles and The Shadows. Rock culture, in the social and political sense, was nowhere in sight. Bands that stood out in the first wave of Israeli rock were The Lions, The Churchills,◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î ◊ë◊¶◊û◊ô◊ó◊î The Fat and the Thins, The Styles, The Electric Stage, The Seventh Radiance, The Goldstars, The Sing-Sing, The Blue Stars and The Spiders. In the euphoria that followed the Six-Day War, the performing groups of the Israel Defense Forces rose in status with a steady stream of songs about victory, bereavement and loss. Rock became part of the alternative music scene that was played mostly in clubs such as \\"Hakarish\\" and \\"Calypso\\", formerly known as drug dens. Near the end of the decade rock and roll gained legitimacy. Western musicians arrived in Israel, and influences of the pop revolution permeated local culture. Some of the local bands added English musicians to their ensemble, creating several new bands that were based on the original rhythm bands. In the second wave of rhythm bands, three main bands led the local rock scene. The first was The Churchills, which consisted of five musicians including Canadian singer Stan Solomon, and British guitarist Robb Huxley. These were the most adventurous of the Israeli rock bands; they played innovative combinations of psychedelic rock mixed with Mediterranean Arab music. In 1970 the Israeli composer Noam Sheriff initiated a concert played by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and The Churchills, and their shared work with Arik Einstein, Oshik Levi and other artists from the mainstream Israeli pop music scene granted the Israeli rock scene a public stamp of approval. The second band, The Lions, was considered to be the first Israeli band to experiment with reggae music. The third prominent Israeli band of those years was the supergroup Uzi and the Styles, created by the former lead singer of The Fat and the Thins, Uzi Fox. The band's varied style was derived from British pop and American soul music and was characterized by the compound-rich processings of wind instruments that resembled Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago, etc. Between the 1960s and the 1970s, successful Israeli musicians showed interest in rock music, and many of them recorded songs in the rock style by themselves or with bands. The artist who took the most significant step towards the adoption of rock as a dominant force in Israeli music was the popular singer Arik Einstein, who in 1969 made The Churchills his backup group. Einstein's albums from those years, Pozi (1969), slug (1970), Plastelina (1970) and Badshe etzel Avigdor (1971) are considered to be groundbreaking in the way in which they combined rock melodies with Hebrew texts. They demonstrated fresh musical perception and created more personal mainstream songs rather than those of the military bands that dominated the previous decade. ===1970s=== In the early 1970s, Israel had a burgeoning progressive rock scene. One of the first performers was Shlomo Gronich, whose 1971 debut was Why Didn't You Tell Me?. Danny Ben Israel's Bullshit 3 was released in 1970, but overlooked for some thirty years. Other 70s prog bands included The Churchills, Zingale, and Sheshet. Israel also developed a new style of rock/metal named Oriental metal, a crossover between death metal and doom metal, influenced by ancient Jewish traditions and the oriental culture both in lyrics and melody. Many bands formed in this decade. The rock band Tamouz gained much success in the 1970s. The most successful Israeli Rock band of the seventies was KaveretIsrael Briefing Book: Culture and Arts Overview which combined rock music and a unique sense of humor. The (consecutive 1st prize) winners of the 1976, 1977, and 1978 Chassidic Song Festival was the band that invented Jewish Rock, The Diaspora Yeshiva Band, who made several albums, had many hits (Hafachta, Malchutcha, Ivdu), and toured worldwide including Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. At decade's end, singers who performed rock music became very popular and successful, including Shalom Hanoch, Ariel Zilber, Svika Pick (in combination with pop music), Efraim Shamir, Yitzhak Klepter and Gary Eckstein. ===1980s=== Mashina During the 1980s a few rock bands became popular. Notable rock bands of the decade were The Click, Benzin, T-Slam, and MashinaIBADOC - The IBA Channel 1 Documentaries Dept :: ◊î◊¢◊®◊ï◊• ◊î◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊ü ◊û◊ó◊ú◊ß◊™ ◊™◊¢◊ï◊ì◊î - End of the Orange Season ‚Äì The History of Israeli Rock, 1998 which became the most successful Israeli rock band of the decade. ===1990s=== Aviv Geffen In 1991 Israeli alternative rock bands and singers broke through, led by Rami Fortis, Berry Sakharof and Aviv Geffen, and young bands like Eifo HaYeled, The Elders of Zfat, Rockfour and Dr. Kasper's Rabbits Show who became very popular. An essential role in the rise of these bands and artists was the former Roxanne club in Tel Aviv, which hosted known artists and emerging artists of rock and alternative rock, exposing new bands to a growing audience. Since then, most of those bands have disbanded, but their members still continue to act in various music projects and mostly constitute the community of the Israeli music of the 2010s. Notable in the field of Glam metal and Heavy metal was the band \\"Stella Maris\\" from Haifa, which began performing in the early 1990s. Stella Maris later integrated in the mainstream Israeli music scene and its vocalist, Pavlo Rosenberg, launched a solo career of his own. Two mid-1990s crises led to the decline of that early 1990s rock boom: First was the Arad festival disaster of July 1995, after which the popularity of these events declined. Then the nationally traumatic murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November that year, is largely considered to have shifted the whole cultural atmosphere of the country, and the prominence and success of the \\"kicking\\" rock of the early 1990s was replaced by more mellow directions. Yet, until the end of that decade, Israeli rock music kept its place as a central musical style, and important bands such as Hamachshefot and Monica Sex formed. === 2000s === HaYehudim in concert, 2010 Although Israeli rock became less popular in the 2000s, being edged out by Israeli pop, many new rock artists and bands emerged. Among the most prominent Israel rock bands of the 2000s are Beit HaBubot, playing melodic rock which focused on acoustic guitar, and Synergia, which had a melodic nu metal sound. Among the other successful emerging Israeli rock bands and artists of this decade were Girafot, Sheygets, HaYehudim, Yoni Bloch, Hadag Nahash, Shy Nobleman, Vaadat Charigim and many more. Many disbanded Israel rock bands began playing again during this decade, including T-Slam, Mofa Ha'arnavot Shel Dr. Kasper, Mercedes Band, Eifo HaYeled, Monica Sex, Mashina, etc. At the end of the 2000s Mizrahi music gained massive popularity in Israel, further weakening the popularity of Israeli rock. ==See also== * List of Israeli rock singers * List of Israeli rock music groups * Rock Mizrahi * Music of Israel * List of Israeli musical artists ==References== Category:Israeli music Category:Music scenes Category:Rock music by country ","title":"Israeli rock"},{"id":"1297960","text":"millisecond after detonation. From the Tumbler-Snapper test series in Nevada, 1952, showing fireball and \\"rope trick\\" effects. The fireball is about 20 meters in diameter in this image Rope trick visible for Hardtack II Lea test Array of sounding rockets with instruments for making scientific measurements of high-altitude nuclear tests during liftoff preparations on Johnston Island High-speed video clip of a nuclear explosion showing the rope trick effect Rope trick is the term given by physicist John Malik to the curious lines and spikes which emanate from the fireball of certain nuclear explosions just after detonation. ==Description== The adjacent photograph shows two unusual phenomena: bright spikes projecting from the bottom of the fireball, and the peculiar mottling of the expanding fireball surface. The surface of the fireball, with a temperature over 20,000 kelvins, emits huge amounts of visible light radiation, more than 100 times the intensity at the Sun's surface. Anything solid in the area absorbs the light and rapidly heats. The \\"rope tricks\\" that protrude from the bottom of the fireball are caused by the heating, rapid vaporization and then expansion of guy wires (or specialized rope trick test cables) that extend from the shot cab, the housing at the top of the tower that contains the explosive device, to the ground. Malik observed that when the rope was painted black, spike formation was enhanced, and if it were painted with reflective paint or wrapped in aluminium foil, no spikes were observed - thus confirming the hypothesis that it is heating and vaporization of the rope, induced by exposure to high-intensity visible light radiation, which causes the effect. Because of the lack of guy wires, no \\"rope trick\\" effects were observed in surface-detonation tests, free-flying weapons tests, or underground tests. The cause of a surface mottling is more complex. In the initial microseconds after the explosion, a fireball is formed around the bomb by the massive numbers of thermal x-rays released by the explosion process. These x-rays cannot travel very far in the lower atmosphere before reacting with molecules in the air, so the result is a fireball that rapidly forms within about in diameter and does not expand. This is known as a \\"radiatively driven\\" fireball. Inside the radiative fireball the bomb itself is rapidly expanding due to the heat generated by the nuclear reactions. This moves outward at supersonic speeds, creating a hydrodynamic shock wave at its outer edge. After a brief period this shock front reaches and then passes the initial radiative fireball. The shock wave contains so much energy that the compression heating it causes in the air causes it to glow. At the point in the explosion captured in the photo above, the shock front has passed the original radiative fireball and has about twice its size. In the first few microseconds after detonation, the bomb casing and shot cab are destroyed and vaporized. These vapors are accelerated to very high velocities, several tens of kilometers per second, faster than the shock front. However, this acceleration happens in a short period, so the material is trapped behind the shock front, even though it eventually travels faster than the shock front. The various light and dark patches are caused by the varying vapor density of the material splashing against the back of the shock front. The irregular variations in mass distribution around the bomb core creates the mottled blob- like appearance. ==Sounding rockets== After a few milliseconds, the energy of the shock front will no longer be great enough to heat the air into incandescence. At that point, the shock front becomes invisible, a process known as \\"breakaway\\". This makes the shock wave difficult to diagnose beyond this boundary. Photographs of nuclear tests often show numerous vertical rope- like lines to one side. These are typically created by small sounding rockets launched a few seconds before the firing, leaving smoke trails. The purpose of these trails is to record the passing of the now invisible shock wave, which causes an obvious visual effect on the smoke by compressing the air into a lens. This is not necessarily related to the rope trick effect in any physical way, but it is possible to confuse the two in some photographs. In the photograph of the Tumbler-Snapper test (at the top of this article), the smoke trails are faintly visible in the lower-right corner. ==Camera recording== The photo was shot by a rapatronic camera (a high-speed camera invented by Harold Edgerton and colleagues) built by EG&G.; Each camera was capable of recording only one exposure on a single sheet of film. To create time-lapse sequences, banks of four to ten cameras were set up to take photos in rapid succession. The average exposure time was three microseconds. ==References== *This article incorporates text from U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, Nevada Site Office, Office of Public Affairs. ==External links== * Category:Nuclear weapons Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Rope trick effect"},{"id":"1297961","text":"Indian Beach may refer to: *Indian Beach (Marin County, California), a beach within Tomales Bay State Park in Marin County, California *Indian Beach (Oregon), a beach within Ecola State Park in Oregon *Indian Beach, Delaware *Indian Beach, Florida, a historical neighborhood in Sarasota *Indian Beach, North Carolina *Old Home Beach (also known as Indian Beach), a beach in Trinidad, Humboldt County, California ","title":"Indian Beach"},{"id":"1297962","text":"Amity may refer to: ==Places== ===United States=== * Eagar, Arizona, a town, formerly named Amity * Amity, Arkansas, a city * Amity (New Haven), Connecticut, an area partly in Woodbridge and partly in New Haven * Amity, Georgia, an unincorporated community * Amity, Indiana, an unincorporated community * Amity, Maine, a town * Amity, Missouri, a village * Amity, New York, a town * Amity, Orange County, New York, a hamlet * Amity, Montgomery County, Ohio, an unincorporated community * Amity, Knox County, Ohio, an unincorporated community * Amity, Madison County, Ohio, an unincorporated community * Amity, Oregon, a city * Amity Hills, Oregon, range of hills northeast of Amity * Amity, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community in Berks County * Amity, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community * Amity Township (disambiguation) ===Australia=== * Amity, Queensland, a town on North Stradbroke Island, Redland City ==Schools== * Amity University (disambiguation), several universities in India * Amity College * Amity Business School, a private business school in India * Amity High School (disambiguation), several schools * Amity International School, in New Delhi, India * Amity School, in Lincolnton, Georgia * Amity International School, Erasmia, South Africa, a private school for students from grade R to 12 * Brooklyn Amity School, Brooklyn, New York, a private school for students from kindergarten to grade 12 * AEON-Amity, a chain of private English schools in Japan ==Other uses== * Amity (given name), a list of people with the name * Amity, a fictional town that is the setting of Jaws (novel), Jaws (film), Jaws 2 and Jaws: The Revenge * Amity (brig), a ship used in Australia in the early nineteenth century * Amity (1801 ship), a merchant ship, Royal Navy sloop and whaler * Amity Foundation, a charity in China * Amity, New Farm, a heritage- listed house in Brisbane, Queensland * Amity Street, Amherst, Massachusetts * Amity, one of the five factions in the Divergent series == See also == * Amityville (disambiguation) ","title":"Amity"},{"id":"1297963","text":"is a Japanese voice actor who is affiliated with Aksent. ==Notable anime and video game voice roles== *Ryu in Street Fighter Zero, Street Fighter Zero 2, Street Fighter EX series *Dan Hibiki in Street Fighter Zero *Yamada in Revolutionary Girl Utena *Milluki Zoldyck in Hunter √ó Hunter (1999) *Arias in Read or Die *Koji Mori in Strawberry Eggs *Tamanian Kid in Beast Wars Second *Masatsugu in Grander Musashi RV *Rodrigo in Hungry Heart: Wild Striker *Ninja Tottori and Yamagishi in Papuwa ==External links== * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese male voice actors ","title":"Katashi Ishizuka"},{"id":"1297968","text":"Navajo Bridge is the name of each of a pair of steel spandrel arch bridges that cross the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon National Park (near Lees Ferry) in northern Coconino County, Arizona, United States. The newer bridge of the pair carries vehicular traffic on U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) over Marble Canyon between Bitter Springs and Jacob Lake, allowing travel into a remote region north of the Colorado River including the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Prior to completion of the first Navajo Bridge, one of the only Colorado River crossings between Arizona and Utah was located about upstream from the bridge site, at the mouth of Glen Canyon where Lees Ferry service had operated since 1873. The ferry site had been chosen as the only relatively easy access to the river for both northbound and southbound travellers. By the 1920s, automobile traffic began using the ferry service though it was not considered a safe and reliable crossing as adverse weather and flooding regularly prevented its operation. The dedication of the original bridge was on June 14‚Äì15, 1929 with an official name of the Grand Canyon Bridge. The state legislature changed the name to Navajo Bridge five years later in 1934. After the new bridge was opened in 1995, the original bridge was closed to vehicular traffic, but is still open for pedestrian and equestrian use. The dual spans of Navajo Bridge are tied at ninth place among the highest bridges in the United States with nearly identical heights of for the original span, and for the second span. ==History== Aerial view of Navajo Bridge with the newer bridge in the foreground, July 2005 Construction of the original Navajo Bridge began in 1927, and the bridge opened to traffic in 1929. The bridge was paid for by the nascent Arizona State Highway Commission (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) in cooperation with the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs, as the eastern landing is on the Navajo Nation. The steel spandrel bridge was designed and constructed by the Kansas City Structural Steel Company. During construction, worker Lane McDaniel died after falling to the Colorado River below. Supervisors had rejected the idea of rigging safety netting, believing that it would catch on fire from falling hot rivets. The original bridge is in length, with a maximum height of from the canyon floor. The roadway offers an surface width with a load capacity of 22.5 tons (although the posted legal weight limit was 40 tons). During the design phase, a wider roadway was considered, but ultimately rejected, as it would have required a costly third arch to be added to the design, and the vehicles of the time did not require a wider road. When the Bridge officially opened on January 12, 1929, the Flagstaff paper proclaimed it \\"the biggest news in Southwest history.\\" By 1990, however, officials decided that the traffic flow was too great for the original bridge and that a new solution was needed. The sharp corners in the roadway on each side of the approach had become a safety hazard due to low visibility, and deficiencies resulting from the original design's width and load capacity specifications were becoming problematic. The bridge had also become part of US 89A. A view of the bridges and Marble Canyon from the Colorado River, September 2009 Deciding on a solution was difficult, due to the many local interests. Issues included preservation of sacred Navajo land, endangered plant species in Marble Canyon, and the possibility of construction debris entering the river. The original proposal called for merely widening and fortifying the bridge, but this was ultimately rejected as not able to meet contemporary federal highway standards. Replacement became the only option, and it was eventually decided to entirely discontinue vehicular traffic on the original bridge. A new bridge would be built immediately next to the original and have a considerably similar visual appearance, but would conform to modern highway codes. The new steel arch bridge was commissioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, and was completed in May 1995, at a cost of $14.7 million. A formal dedication was held on September 14, 1995. The original Navajo Bridge is still open to pedestrian and equestrian use, and an interpretive center has been constructed on the west side to showcase the historical nature of the bridge and early crossing of the Colorado River. The original bridge has been designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1981. California condors were reintroduced to the area in 1996 and can sometimes be seen in the at Navajo Bridge. ==Bridge characteristics== ===Original bridge (1929)=== Total length: Steel arch length: Arch rise: Height above river: Width of the roadway: Amount of steel: Amount of concrete: Amount of steel reinforcement: Construction cost: $390,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) ===New bridge (1995)=== Total length: Steel arch length: Arch rise: Height above river: Width of the roadway: Amount of steel: Amount of concrete: Amount of steel reinforcement: Construction cost $14.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) ==See also== * List of bridges in the United States by height * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona * National Register of Historic Places listings in Coconino County, Arizona ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Excellence in Highway Design: Navajo Bridge (archive) * * American Society of Civil Engineering ‚Äì Navajo Bridge (archive) * * (note: year of completion is listed incorrectly as 1997) * 85 photos from the construction of Grand Canyon/Navajo bridge Category:Road bridges in Arizona Category:Bridges over the Colorado River Category:Buildings and structures in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Open-spandrel deck arch bridges in the United States Category:Truss arch bridges in the United States Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:U.S. Route 89 Category:Transportation in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Bridges completed in 1927 Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Arizona Category:1929 establishments in Arizona Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Canyon National Park ","title":"Navajo Bridge"},{"id":"1297973","text":"A cheesymite scroll is an Australian baked-food item commonly found at Bakers DelightRochfort, Scott.

It is located within the Bickleton CDP. Cleveland was first settled in 1879 by Ripley Dodge, who named it for the city of his native state of Ohio. Cleveland contains an old cemetery and a rodeo. The rodeo, the oldest in the state, has been completely refurbished. Also on the rodeo grounds is a 100-year-old Spillman carousel that has been completely refurbished thanks to grants and private funds. The closest town is Bickleton. An annual rodeo is held the 2nd weekend in June along with Pioneer days in which the carousel is restored to operating conditions as it was back in 1907, with the original carousel horses which are housed in the Museum in Bickleton. Cleveland is home to a carousel. Per R. Bollinger, former owner of The Oaks amusement park and benefactor of the Oaks Park Association (the non-profit he set up to perpetuate The Oaks), the carousel was one of the few rides owned by The Oaks when it opened May 30, 1905. It was sold to the Bickleton/Cleveland group in 1928 along with the band organ and ticket booth. Over the years, the method used to turn this machine was modified from using donkeys or small horses to a steam engine and, later, a tractor engine. The communities of Bickleton and Cleveland have kept the carousel maintained throughout the years. Cleveland's most famous resident was William O. Douglas, the longest sitting member of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Kleinburg is an unincorporated village in the city of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is home to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, an art gallery with a focus on the Group of Seven, and the Kortright Centre for Conservation. In 2001, the village and its surrounding communities had a population of 4,595; the village itself has 282 dwellings, with a population of 952. Kleinburg comprises a narrow section of hilly landscape situated between two branches of the Humber River. The historic village is bounded by Highway 27 on the west and Stegman‚Äôs Mill Road to the east.City of Vaughan Archives, Accessed On 2008-01-04 Kleinburg has subsumed the nearby hamlet of Nashville, but has not itself been fully subsumed into the main urban area of Vaughan. ==Geography== The village is located between two branches of the Humber River, and features dense forests throughout its 1.05 km¬≤ of land area. Its northern and western peripheries are primarily agricultural. ==History== Kleinburg was founded in 1848 by John Nicholas Kline (1825‚Äì1854), a German-Canadian settler. A direct German translation of Kleinburg is \\"small castle\\". Residents argue that the community of Kleinburg could be named after its founder or after its landscape (though the latter would necessitate the spelling \\"Kleinberg\\", \\"Small Mountain\\" in English). In its early days, Kleinburg was dependent on its many flour and wheat mills, located off the Humber River. Kleinburg has historically been a small, quiet town, but now attracts many affluent visitors and residents. Housing developments began in the 1950s in the west and continued in the 1970s southeast of Kleinburg. Other developments occurred in 1993 in the south, 1998 in the northeast, and the 2000s to the north. During its major expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s, many new large homes were built. ==Main Street== The historic commercial district of Kleinburg along Islington Avenue has many heritage buildings, as well as modern developments with mixed residential and commercial uses. Main street has local shops, restaurants, and national chains including Subway, Starbucks, and Royal Bank. Its oldest extant building, built in 1867, is home of The Doctor's House restaurant. Local attractions include McMichael Art Gallery, Kortright Centre, Humber River Trails, Bindertwine Park, Pierre Berton Heritage Centre, and Copper Creek Golf Course. ==Politics== Kleinburg is not an incorporated entity; it has no political jurisdiction and no geopolitically-defined boundaries. Residents vote for a councillor in ward 1 of Vaughan City Council. The community of Nashville, though distinct from Kleinburg, is considered part of Kleinburg. Residents of Nashville receive many of their services, such as postal and medical services, within Kleinburg. ==Education== Most non-Catholic students were once bused to nearby King City Secondary School in King City. Since the opening of Emily Carr Secondary School, busing was eliminated, forcing students to walk far to get to the school as not even public busing services the area. There are not enough students for Kleinburg's own secondary school. However, there is a private school in the area, known as The Hill Academy (K-12). In 2008, the oldest and most historical school, Kleinburg Public Elementary school, was demolished and a new public elementary school by the same name was built and opened in September 2009. There are 5 schools in Kleinburg: *Kleinburg Christian Academy (Private Elementary) *Kleinburg Public Elementary School (Public Elementary) *Ecole La Fontaine (French Public Elementary School) *Montessori School of Kleinburg (Private School) *The Hill Academy (Private Secondary for student-athletes) *Pope Francis Catholic School (Public Catholic School) ==Parks and recreation== Kleinburg is home to several parks, all of which are operated by the city of Vaughan's Parks and Forestry Operations. * Bindertwine Park * Butterfly Heights * East Corners Park * Ross Gurreri Park * Secord Park * Summit Park * Tinsmith Parkette * Treelawn Parkette * Wishing Well Park * Woodgate Park While Kleinburg does not have its own community centre, its residents make use of the Al Palladini Community Centre, located in nearby Woodbridge. ==Culture== Binder Twine is a festival held annually that attracts 25,000 people on average. This tradition began in 1890 by Charles Shaw Jr. who distributed binder twine to local farmers.http://www.kleinburgvillage.ca/about-us/history/ Kleinburg also has a Christmas tree lighting celebration where the community comes together to donate to The Red Bow Campaign and the KARA Holiday Food Drive while waiting for the lighting of the tree in front of the Kline house.http://www.kleinburgvillage.ca/events/ There is also Canada Day in Kleinburg and Cartunes in Kleinburg events which allow the community to celebrate the history of the village. ==In film== Kleinburg is home to the Cinespace Film Studios (formerly Toronto International Film Studios), a centre for television and motion picture production. The TV show The Forest Rangers was filmed here from 1963 to 1965. A reunion was held at the studios in June, 2013 with Gordon Pinsent and nine junior rangers in attendance. Other films shot at the studio between 1960 and 1990 include: The Hired Gun, The Fox, The First Time, The Reincarnate, Mahoney's Last Stand, Equus, Recommendation for Mercy, Shoot, Welcome to Blood City, Death Weekend, The Shape of Things to Come, Rituals, Riel, Fish Hawk, The Amateur, Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird, The Fly, The Wars, Love at Stake and Divided Loyalities. Television shows filmed here include: Hudson's Bay, The Forest Rangers, Hatch's Mill, The Adventures of Timothy Pilgrim, Matt and Jenny and The Littlest Hobo. Downtown Kleinburg and the farmland surrounding it featured significantly in the 1st season of the 1971 television series, Dr. Simon Locke. In 2006, the movie The Sentinel was filmed at the McMichael Art Gallery. In the movie all of the Camp David scenes, both indoor and outdoor, were filmed on the grounds of the McMichael Art Gallery, most notably the scene on the \\"Wedding Hill\\" where they filmed the president's helicopter taking off and being shot down by a missile (the explosion was added in after using special effects). In 2015, Cinespace moved out of the studios they had been renting. The Vaughan Sports Centre, a private company, has repurposed them as baseball training facilities. https://vaughansc.com/ ==Notable residents== Kleinburg was home to Canadian author Pierre Berton for nearly 50 years until his death in 2004, and to his friend and business associate John G. McClelland, co-founder of McClelland & Stewart. Kleinburg was also the home of former prime minister Lester B. Pearson. Kleinburg is also the current home of Ontario's youngest Minister of Education Stephen Lecce. ==References== ==External links== * Kleinburg Village website * The Canadian Encyclopedia ‚Äì Kleinburg * Kleinburg Nashville Historical Collection Category:Neighbourhoods in Vaughan Category:Populated places established in 1848 ","title":"Kleinburg"},{"id":"1297999","text":"Indian Trail can refer to: * A part of or the whole of the Great Trail created by Native Americans * Indian Trail, North Carolina It may also refer to any of the following: Schools: * Indian Trail Elementary School in Canal Winchester, Ohio that is part of the Canal Winchester Local School District * Indian Trail Elementary School in Downers Grove, Illinois that is part of the Downers Grove Grade School District 58 * Indian Trail Elementary School in Highland Park, Illinois that is part of the North Shore School District 112 * Indian Trail Elementary School in Independence, Missouri that is part of the Fort Osage R-1 School District * Indian Trail Elementary School in Indian Trail, North Carolina that is part of the Union County Public Schools District * Indian Trail Elementary School in LaPorte, Indiana that is part of the LaPorte Community School Corporation * Indian Trail Elementary School in Louisville, Kentucky that is part of the Jefferson County Public Schools * Indian Trail Elementary School in Plainfield, Illinois that is part of the Plainfield Community Consolidated School District 202 * Indian Trail Elementary School in Spokane, Washington that is part of the Spokane Public Schools district * Indian Trail Elementary School in Stow, Ohio that is part of the Stow-Munroe Falls City School District * Indian Trail High School and Academy, Kenosha, Wisconsin, part of the Kenosha Unified School District * Indian Trail Intermediate School in Johnson City, Tennessee that is part of the Johnson City Schools district * Indian Trail Junior High School, Addison, Illinois that is part of the Addison School District 4 * Indian Trail Middle School in Olathe, Kansas that is part of the Olathe School District * Indian Trail School in Frankfort, Illinois that is part of Summit Hill School District 161 * Indian Trails Middle School in Palm Coast, Florida that is part of the Flagler County Public Schools district * Indian Trails Middle School in Winter Springs, Florida that is part of the Seminole County Public Schools district Other: * Camp Indian Trails, a Boy Scout Camp northwest of Janesville, Wisconsin that is owned by the Glacier's Edge Council * Indian Trail Camp, a camp south of Norwalk, Ohio * Indian Trail Conservation Area in Dent County, Missouri * Indian Trail Improvement District in central Palm Beach County, Florida * Indian Trail Library District in Wheeling, Illinois * Indian Trail Golf Course in Batesburg, South Carolina * Indian Trail Golf Course in Grand Rapids, Michigan * Indian Trails, an intercity bus service provider in and around Michigan * Indian Trails Camp, a camp west of Grand Rapids, Michigan * Indian Trails Council, a scouting organization in Connecticut ","title":"Indian Trail"},{"id":"1298005","text":"Indian Village may refer generally to a village of American Indians, the indigenous peoples of the Americas or to a rural village in India.

Norway has produced a number of famous rock bands, including Titanic, a-ha and Kaizers Orchestra. ==1950s and 1960s== The most known rock and roll performers in the 1950s were Per Granberg, Per Hartvig (Rocke-Pelle), Jan Rohde and Odd Gisl√∏y (Smiling Tommy). Gisl√∏y even penned his own rock and roll composition: \\"Dancing with My Rockin' Shoes\\". In the early 1960s the so- called Shadow bands (named after the British instrumental group The Shadows) were popular. Among the most notable were The Beatniks and The Vanguards. In the mid-1960s The Pussycats recorded two albums: one in Great Britain and one in West Germany, both produced by Sven-Erik B√∏rja. Most of the songs were composed by group member Trond Graff. ==1970s and 1980s== Titanic reached # 5 on the UK singles chart in 1971. Norway also has a notable progressive rock scene, which began in 1971 with the release of Junipher Greene's Friendship, the country's first double album. Later, more progressive bands like Folque incorporated elements of traditional Norwegian folk music in their recordings. Other bands include Ruphus, Aunt Mary and H√∏st. This scene was in large part fueled by the success Frank Zappa had in Norway. In the 80s Norway had A-Ha, Artch, Return, Stage Dolls and TNT, the first Norwegian band to be featured on the American Billboard charts. In the latter years of this decade a new generation of bands started to gain popularity. These were bands who sang in Norwegian. Here Norway got the \\"4 great ones\\": DumDum Boys, DeLillos, Raga Rockers and Jokke & Valentinerne. All these bands except Jokke (Joachim \\"Jokke\\" Nielsen died in 2000) are still active. ==Since 1990== More recently, the Norwegian rock-scene has been dominated internationally by bands such as Turbonegro, Gluecifer and Madrugada, but several bands (like BigBang, Euroboys and Span) concentrate on the domestic market. The Stavanger hard rock band Kvelertak has been touring around the world with Purified in Blood among others since the release of their self-titled debut album in 2010. In the 1990s, Norway saw the growing of the underground black metal scene, with bands including Mayhem, Immortal, Enslaved, Darkthrone, Burzum, Gorgoroth, Satyricon and Dimmu Borgir. Industrial rock band Zeromancer was formed in 1999. A few members were formerly in the band Seigmen. Since 2001, Kaizers Orchestra has been among the most important rock bands in Norway. The band employs a variety of unusual instruments including a pump organ and an accordion. They are known for their use of oil barrels, car wheels, and garbage cans as percussion instruments.

The history of the Portuguese rock music scene spans several decades. ==History== ===1950s to 1970s=== In the late 1950s, singer Joaquim Costa was one of the first rock artists, but it was only during the 1960s that the genre's popularity began rising, with bands such as \\"Quinteto Acad√©mico\\" and \\"Sheiks\\", who played mostly in clubs and student associations. Most of these groups played covers of American and British bands or were influenced by artists such as the Beatles and The Shadows. The rock scene's development was limited in its commercial and creative scope due to the country's isolation, which was under a fascist dictatorship until 1974. During the 1970s, and particularly after democracy was established after the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal became home to an active progressive rock scene, which included bands like Tantra, Petrus Castrus, Banda do Casaco and the highly successful Quarteto 1111. During the latter part of the decade, Jose Cid, Quarteto 1111's vocalist and keyboardist, pursued a solo career, releasing the landmark symphonic album 10,000 Anos Depois Entre Venus E Marte before turning to mainstream pop music. Portugal's progressive rock epoch came to a close with the release of Ascen√ß√£o e Queda, a rock opera by Petrus Castrus. Most of these records remain in short supply to this date. Until the end of the 1970s, Portuguese folk music and protest songs were generally the most popular types of music - but gradually more rock bands and styles began to appear, benefiting from the country's new- found openness. ===1980s=== Rock music finally hit the mainstream in 1980 with the release of Ar de Rock by Rui Veloso, which was the first popular Portuguese rock album. During the 1980s, Veloso's blues-rock sound achieved national success and inspired the creation of several rock and roll bands, which became popular with youths growing up in the post-1974 modernized Portugal. The success of groups like Taxi, Her√≥is do Mar and Trabalhadores do Com√©rcio, indicated that a solid rock scene was growing, despite the fact that these were all relatively ephemeral projects. Xutos & Pontap√©s are arguably the biggest success case in the Portuguese rock scene, having become the first band in the country to celebrate 30 years of career. Their early works had close roots to punk rock and rockabilly, but later incorporated hard rock and folk influences into their sound, becoming more diverse. UHF, another band that started in the early 80s, visually resembled the hard rock-playing hair bands that popped up in America and Europe - however, like Xutos, their sound was derived mainly from punk rock and folk influences. Other major projects from this period include GNR, Roxig√©nio, Taxi and Peste & Sida, which turned to ska as an inspiration and would later switch to punk. GNR abandoned ska after two years when they changed vocalists, adopting poetic, and nonsensical lyrics, and a bigger use of synthpop sounds. Heavy Metal began building up a following among the younger generation living and bands proliferated, especially in the North of the country. Few made it to the studio and those that did released mostly low budget singles. 1982 saw the first release of a Heavy Metal LP in the country, Forte e Feio by NZZN, but the production was poor and the record was not well received by critics. The late 1980s saw the rise of Tarantula, probably the first Portuguese Heavy Metal band with relevant impact outside the country. During the mid-1980s, synthpop became even more prevalent in Portuguese rock, with the success of S√©tima Legi√£o and Her√≥is do Mar, which were heavily influenced by acts such as Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode and Gary Numan. Combining synthesized sounds and beats with Portuguese lyrics exalting the country's history, they attracted controversy and were accused of being political reactionaries and supportive of the extinct dictatorial regime. Her√≥is do Mar disbanded in 1990, but their momentum was taken over by other projects influenced not only by new wave, but also alternative rock and indie rock: R√°dio Macau, Mler Ife Dada and Pop Dell'Arte, among others. Punk rock remained mostly an underground phenomenon, although a circuit of venues and events in the country's major cities grew during this decade. Relevant punk bands to emerge during this period include Censurados, Mata Ratos and Peste & Sida. Although most bands from this period were short-lived and none achieved international success, 1980's Portuguese rock was extremely diverse - each major band developed their own signature sound, and the national rock scene became very rich, spanning a wide variety of themes and styles. ===1990s=== The 1990s were also a very creative and active decade, with openness to new trends and a growth in the music market marked by the increasing popularity of international music festivals that attracted major rock bands to the country. A handful of major 1980s rock artists (such as Rui Veloso, GNR, Xutos & Pontap√©s) managed to maintain and grow their careers and fan bases. This decade was notable for the rise of very active heavy metal, underground and alternative rock scenes. Several major bands from the 1990s achieved both national and international success and were able to continue their careers into the 21st century, including Moonspell (an internationally renowned gothic / heavy metal band from Lisbon), M√£o Morta (alternative and experimental rock project with a considerable cult following), Blasted Mechanism (a theatrical, sci-fi themed band that mixes rock with electronica, reggae and dub), Zen (alternative rock band), Ena P√° 2000 (a comedy rock outfit) and Da Weasel (a rock/hip-hop fusion band). While some of the 1990s signature rock genres such as grunge, industrial rock and nu metal were very popular with Portuguese youngsters, few Portuguese bands fully adopted these styles and none achieved great success. Exceptions include Da Weasel (who incorporated elements of nu metal in their later albums), Blind Zero (pop/rock band that started out as a grunge outfit) and Bizarra Locomotiva (industrial metal band with a sizable cult following). On the mainstream front (pop/rock), Quinta do Bill, a folk-rock group, achieved some notoriety, and two other bands rose to prominence: Silence 4, an English- singing pop/rock act from Leiria, and Ornatos Violeta, a Portuguese-singing rock band from Porto. Despite huge national success, critical acclaim (particularly for Ornatos Violeta) and lasting influence, both groups disbanded at the turn of the millennium. ===2000s - 2010s=== Much like in other European and Anglo-American countries, the decade starting in 2001 saw the rise of hip-hop, dance music and more pop-oriented acts, with audiences for rock music dwindling. Although established bands who had begun their careers during the 1980s (Rui Veloso, Xutos & Pontap√©s) and 1990s (Moonspell, Blasted Mechanism, M√£o Morta) maintained thriving careers, the rock music scene became more fragmented and directed at niche markets. Nevertheless, some popular groups and projects surfaced: Toranja (pop/rock, Lisbon), Wraygunn (blues-rock collective from Coimbra) and Legendary Tiger Man (WrayGunn vocalist Paulo Furtado's solo project), and pop/rock acts influenced by electronic music such as Micro Audio Waves and Mesa. Cl√£, another Portuguese- singing pop/rock act who had surfaced in Porto during the mid-1990s, scored their biggest commercial hits during the 2000s decade. During the 2010s, new bands appeared, playing in a variety of rock subgenres: pop/rock (Amor Electro, Diabo na Cruz, Capit√£o Fausto, and Salvador Sobral's band Alexander Search); blues-rock (Black Mamba); alternative and indie rock (Paus, peixe : avi√£o, Linda Martini); psychedelic /stoner rock (The Quartet of Woah!) and heavy metal (Kandia, Noidz). ==See also== * Brazilian rock ==References== Category:Music scenes Category:Portuguese styles of music Category:Rock music by country Portugal ","title":"Rock music in Portugal"},{"id":"1298045","text":"Caupo of Turaida, or Kaupo (died September 21, 1217) was a leader of the Finnic-speaking Livonian people in the beginning of the 13th century, in what is now part of Latvia and Estonia. He is sometimes called 'King of Livonia', Chronicle of Henry of Livonia calls him quasi rex, 'like a king'.Stephen Turnubll, Crusader Castles of the Teutonic Knights (2 ed.), Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011, ==Biography== He was the first prominent Livonian to be christened.Heinrici Chronicon Livoniae, Henricus (de Lettis) ed., Olion, 1982, p.43. He was probably baptized around 1191 by a priest called Theoderic. He became an ardent Christian and friend of Albert of Buxhoeveden, Bishop of Riga, who took him 1203-1204 all the way to Rome and introduced him to Pope Innocent III. The Pope was impressed by the converted pagan chief and presented him a Bible. When he returned from travel, his tribe rebelled against him and Caupo helped to conquer and destroy his own former Castle of Turaida in 1212. The castle was rebuilt two years later as a stone castle that is well preserved even today.DK, DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Estonia, Latvia & Lithuania, Dorling Kindersley Ltd, 2015, , p.192. Caupo participated in a crusader raid against the still pagan Estonians and was killed in the Battle of St. Matthew's Day in 1217 against the troops of the Estonian leader Lembitu of Lehola. He did not have any male heirs as his son Bertold had been killed 1210 in the Battle of √úmera against Estonians. He left his inheritance to the church, but the Lieven family later claimed female-line descent from him. Modern Estonians, Latvians, and the remaining few Livonians do not have consensus view about the historical role of Caupo. Some consider him traitor and enemy agent. Others consider him a visionary leader who wanted his people to be part of Christian and European culture. Both these judgments attribute 19th-century views about nationality to a medieval chieftain. Latvian legends, however, are unequivocal: there he is named \\"Kaupo the accursed, the scourge of the Livs,... Kaupo who has sold his soul to the foreign bishops.\\"Urch, R.O.G.

The island is accessible only by aircraftAirNav: 08GA - Sapelo Island Airport or boat; the primary ferry comes from the Sapelo Island Visitors Center in McIntosh County, Georgia, a seven-mile (11 km), twenty- minute trip. It is the site of Hog Hammock, the last known Gullah community. It is illegal to visit the island without a permit issued by state tourism authorities. Sapelo Island map Approximately 97 percent of the island is owned by the state of Georgia and is managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources; the remainder is under private ownership. The western perimeter of Sapelo is the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve (SINERR)Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, Sapelo Island, Georgia which is part of NOAA's National Estuarine Research Reserve system (NERR).National Estuarine Research Reserve System, nerrs.noaa.gov The University of Georgia Marine Institute,Welcome to the University of Georgia Marine Institute at Sapelo Island which is focused on research and education, is located on on the south end of the island. The Reynolds Mansion, a Georgia State Park,Georgia State Parks - Sapelo Island Reserve and Reynolds Mansion also lies on the south end of the island. Visitors to the island must be a part of an organized tour or guests of residents on the island. The island also has a small private airport run by the state of Georgia. ==Hog Hammock== The community of Hog Hammock, also known as Hogg Hummock, includes homes, a general store, bar, public library, and other small businesses including vacation rentals. There are two active church congregations in Hog Hammock: St. Luke Baptist Church, founded in 1885, and First African Baptist Church, established in 1866. The latter congregation has an older building known as First African Baptist Church at Raccoon Bluff, constructed in 1900 in the former Raccoon Bluff community north of Hog Hammock. It is used for special services and programs. Many of the full-time inhabitants of the Hog Hammock Community are African Americans known as Gullah-Geechees, descendants of enslaved West African people brought to the island in the 1700s and 1800s to work on island plantations. The current population of full-time Gullah-Geechee residents in the community is estimated to be 47 (2009). The residents must bring all supplies from the mainland or purchase them in the small store on the island. The children of Hog Hammock take the ferry to the mainland and then take a bus to school, as the island school closed in 1978. Hog Hammock is also home to the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society, Inc. (SICARS), a non- profit organization whose mission is to preserve and revitalize the Hogg Hummock Community. SICARS was founded in 1993 by Hogg Hummock residents and non-resident descendants who wanted to enhance the future of their community by educating all visitors to the island about the history and to increase awareness that Sapelo has existed as an African community for over 200 years. SICARS was incorporated in 1994, has over 600 members, and continues to grow each year. The organization hosts a Cultural Day festival every third Saturday in October. The entire of the community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as Hog Hammock Historic District. In the 1990s, people from the mainland began acquiring parcels of land from the Gullahs to construct vacation homes. In 2012, McIntosh County property tax appraisers notified Hog Hammock residents of huge property tax increases, even though there was no longer a school on the island. One Hog Hammock property owner's annual tax bill soared from $600 to $2,100. In 2013, a fight over the sudden tax hikes was well underway, with some residents claiming they would be driven from land they had owned for many generations for the benefit of mainlanders who would acquire more of Hog Hammock's homes.Ga. island slave descendants fight huge tax hikes, By Russ Bynum, Associated Press ==History== Sapelo Island is speculated to be the site of San Miguel de Gualdape, the short-lived (1526‚Äì1527) first European settlement in the present-day United States and, if true, it would also be the first place in the present-day U.S. that a Catholic mass was celebrated.Antonio Montesino, Catholic Encyclopedia, newadvent.org During the 17th century Sapelo Island was part of the Guale missionary province of Spanish Florida. After 1680, several missions were merged and relocated to the island under the mission Santa Catalina de Guale. Tabby ruins of Spalding's 1809 sugar mill In the early 19th century Thomas Spalding, a future Georgia Senator and U.S. Representative, bought the island and developed it into a plantation, selling live oak for shipbuilding, introducing irrigation ditches, and cultivating Sea Island Cotton, corn, and sugar cane. Spalding brought 400 slaves to the island from West Africa and the West Indies to work the plantation and build what would become the Spalding Mansion. One of the slaves owned by Thomas Spalding was Bilali Muhammad, an Islamic scholar from West Africa who authored a 13-page document about Islamic law on the island ‚Äî possibly the first manuscript of Islamic law ever written in the United States. In 1820, a Winslow Lewis brick lighthouse was built on the island. Although it remained dark for over 90 years, it was restored and relit in 1998. Spalding opposed the abolition of slavery and he died in 1851 returning from a convention to assert Georgia's position on the matter. When freed, the former slaves established several settlements on the island; the last remaining is Hog Hammock, with approximately 70 remaining land owners. During the Civil War, the Spalding home was heavily vandalized and lay in ruins. R. J. Reynolds mansion By the early 20th Century the International Road Races were attracting notables from the motor world to Savannah, Georgia. One attendee was Howard E. Coffin, founder of the Hudson Motor Car Company. Coffin purchased the entire island, save for the land owned by the former slaves, for $150,000 in 1912. Like Spalding, the Coffins embarked on numerous projects. Miles of shell-covered roads were laid, creeks were bridged, old fields were cultivated and large tracts were set aside for cattle grazing. The Coffins also renovated and enlarged the Spalding house, creating an island paradise unsurpassed on the coast. Former presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover as well as aviator Charles Lindbergh were guests in the home. Tobacco heir Richard Joshua Reynolds Jr., of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company bought Sapelo from Coffin in 1934 during the Great Depression, and continued the tradition of agricultural experimentation of the previous owners. Reynolds and his family used his private island paradise as a part-time residence for three decades, consolidating the island's African-American residents into Hog Hammock. Many worked as servants in South End House, later renamed the Reynolds Mansion by the State of Georgia. == Ecology research == In 1923 Sapelo owner Howard Coffin introduced imported chachalacas from Mexico to diversify the game bird population for his hunting pals. These chicken-like birds have established a stable, non-native population of 30-40 individuals that at times has spread to neighboring islands.Sherr, Evelyn; 2015; The Chachalacas of Sapelo Island; UGA Press; https://ugapress.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/the-chachalacas-of-sapelo-island/ Sapelo owner R. J. Reynolds, Jr. founded the Sapelo Island Research Foundation in 1949. He later funded the research of Eugene Odum, whose 1958 paper The Ecology of a Salt Marsh won wide acclaim in scientific circles. Odum's paper helped show the fragility of the cycle of nature in the wetlands. Reynolds' Sapelo Research Foundation also helped fund the University of Georgia's research on the island. Reynolds' widow, Annemarie Reynolds, sold Sapelo to the state of Georgia for $1 million, a fraction of its worth, in two separate transactions in 1969 and 1976. The latter sale resulted in the creation of the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, a state-federal partnership between the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Thanks in part to the philanthropy of the Reynolds family, Sapelo is now open to the public by appointment. ==Natural history== Sapelo Island is located within the Georgia Bight, a tidally- influenced coastline that experiences two tidal cycles each day. Average difference between low and high tides at Sapelo Island is ~7 feet. Consequently, Sapelo island is an example of a tidally-influenced barrier island system. Over the last 2.5 million years (Neogene and Quaternary Periods), sea-level fall occurred in response to growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice cap. The resulting regression generated shoreline complexes that preceded the modern Holocene shoreline, with the most recent known as the late Pleistocene Silver Bluff Formation. The Silver Bluff deposits underlie Holocene Sapelo Island sediments, and are visible along the southwestern bank of Blackbeard Creek as the Raccoon Bluff. During the last glacial maximum (LGM) approximately 18,000 years ago (latest Pleistocene), maximum regression forced the Sapelo Island shoreline eastward approximately 62 miles (100 km) from its present day location. During the subsequent transgression, a Holocene shoreline formed the present Sapelo Island shoreline complex, including Cabretta and Nannygoat beaches. ===Hurricane Irma=== In 2017, storm surge from Hurricane Irma caused a new tidal inlet to breach the southern end of Blackbeard Island, and created a small island between Sapelo Island and Blackbeard Island. ==Tourism== The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) offers tours several days a week. These can be booked through the Sapelo Island Visitors Center. Additionally, many island residents offer private tours, which can often be customized to fit the interests of individual tourists. A state campground is also available to groups of 15 to 25 people on Cabretta Island, adjacent to Sapelo Island. ==In popular culture== Cornelia Walker Bailey, Sapelo Island resident and descendant of Bilali Muhammed, wrote the book God, Dr. Buzzard and the Bolito Man: A Saltwater Geechee Talk About Life on Sapelo Island, Georgia () which is a first-person account of growing up on Sapelo; co-author Christena Bledsoe. R. J. Reynolds' grandson Patrick Reynolds and author Tom Shachtman co-authored The Gilded Leaf: Triumph, Tragedy and Tobacco - Three Generations of the R. J. Reynolds Fortune and Family (), which offers an unvarnished view of R. J. Reynolds, Jr. during the time he owned Sapelo. Author Tom Poland wrote a novel titled Forbidden Island ... An Island Called Sapelo (). Singer Larry Jon Wilson has recorded a song titled \\"Sapelo\\", which is about the island on the album Testifying - The Country Soul Revue. Author and island resident Michele Nicole Johnson published the photograph book, Sapelo Island's Hog Hammock, in 2009 (). Author T. C. Boyle set his 1990 novel East is East on a fictional island in Georgia, much of which resembles Sapelo Island, such as the presence of Hog Hammock and proximity to Darien. An episode of Season 6 of the Discovery Channel show Dirty Jobs featured the termite research program at the University of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island. An episode of ESPN's Outside the Lines was filmed on Sapelo Island and the Hog Hammock community in 2013, documenting the childhood of Allen Bailey and telling the community's story and current property tax issues. The Podcast Uncivil published on 10/11/17 was mostly based on the experience of local Gullah people struggling to keep their land and culture intact, despite many legal struggles. \\"A 19th century promise, and a 21st century betrayal.

His family moved to Paris when he was four years old, and he received his education there. As a young man, Encausse spent a great deal of time at the Biblioth√®que Nationale studying the Kabbalah, occult tarot, magic and alchemy, and the writings of Eliphas L√©vi. He joined the French Theosophical Society shortly after it was founded by Madame Blavatsky in 1884‚Äì1885, but he resigned soon after joining because he disliked the Society's emphasis on Eastern occultism. ==Career== ===Overview=== In 1888, he co-founded his own group, the Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix. That same year, he and his friend Lucien Chamuel founded the Librarie du Merveilleux and its monthly revue L'Initiation, which remained in publication until 1914. Encausse was also a member of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn temple in Paris, as well as Memphis-Misraim and probably other esoteric or paramasonic organizations, as well as being an author of several occult books. Outside of his paramasonic and Martinist activities he was also a spiritual student of the French spiritualist healer, Anthelme Nizier Philippe, \\"Ma√Ætre Philippe de Lyon\\". Despite his heavy involvement in occultism and occultist groups, Encausse managed to find time to pursue more conventional academic studies at the University of Paris. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1894 upon submitting a dissertation on Philosophical Anatomy. He opened a clinic in the rue Rodin which was quite successful. Encausse visited Russia three times, in 1901, 1905, and 1906, serving Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra both as physician and occult consultant. It has been incorrectly claimed that in October 1905, he conjured up the spirit of Alexander III (father of Tsar Nicholas), who prophesied that the Tsar would meet his downfall at the hands of revolutionaries. Encausse's followers allege that he informed the Tsar that he would be able to magically avert Alexander's prophesy so long as Encausse was alive. Nicholas kept his hold on the throne of Russia until 141 days after Papus' death. Although Encausse seems to have served the Tsar and Tsarina in what was essentially the capacity of a mediumistic spiritual advisor, he was later curiously concerned about their heavy reliance on occultism to assist them in deciding questions of government. During their later correspondence, he warned them a number of times against the influence of Rasputin. ===Involvement and influences=== ;Levi, Tarot, and the Kabbalah Encausse's early readings in tarot and the lore of the Kabbalah in translation was inspired by the occult writings of Eliphas L√©vi, whose translation of the \\"Nuctemeron of Apollonius of Tyana\\" printed as a supplement to Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (1855), provided Encausse with his nom de plume. \\"Papus\\" is the name of a Genius of the First Hour in the Nuctemeron, and is translated in the text as \\"physician.\\" ;1891 l'Ordre des Sup√©rieurs Inconnus In 1891, Encausse claimed to have come into the possession of the original papers of Martinez Paschalis, or de Pasqually (c. 1700-1774), and therewith founded an Order of Martinists called l'Ordre des Sup√©rieurs Inconnus. He claimed to have been given authority in the Rite of Saint-Martin by his friend Henri Vicomte de Laage, who claimed that his maternal grandfather had been initiated into the order by Saint-Martin himself, and who had attempted to revive the order in 1887. The Martinist Order was to become a primary focus for Encausse, and continues today as one of his most enduring legacies. ;1893-1895 Bishop of l'√âglise Gnostique de France In 1893, Encausse was consecrated a bishop of l'√âglise Gnostique de France by Jules Doinel, who had founded this Church as an attempt to revive the Cathar religion in 1890. In 1895, Doinel abdicated as Primate of the French Gnostic Church, leaving control of the Church to a synod of three of his former bishops, one of whom was Encausse. ;1895 - 1888 The Golden Dawn; Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix In March 1895, Encausse joined the Ahathoor Temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in Paris. Although Encausse claimed as his \\"spiritual master\\" the mysterious magician and healer known as \\"le Maitre Philippe\\" (Philippe Nizier), his first actual teacher in the intellectual aspects of occultism was the marquis Joseph Alexandre Saint- Yves d'Alveydre (1842 - 1910). Saint-Yves had inherited the papers of one of the great founders of French occultism, Antoine Fabre d'Olivet (1762 - 1825), and it was probably Saint-Yves who introduced Papus to the marquis Stanislas de Guaita (1861 - 1897). In 1888, Encausse, Saint-Yves and de Guaita joined with Jos√©phin P√©ladan and Oswald Wirth to found the Rosicrucian Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix. ;1901 Questionable Anti-Semitic writings In October 1901 Encausse collaborated with Jean Carr√®re in producing a series of articles in the Echo de Paris under the pseudonym Niet (\\"no\\" in Russian). In the articles Sergei Witte and Pyotr Rachkovsky were attacked, and it was suggested that there was a sinister financial syndicate trying to disrupt the Franco- Russian alliance. Encausse and Carr√®re predicted that this syndicate was a Jewish conspiracy, and the anti-Semitic nature of these articles, compounded by Encausse's known connection to the Tsar of Russia, may have contributed to the allegation that Papus was the author who forged The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. ;1908 - 1913 Encausse, Reuss and paramasonry Encausse never became a regular Freemason. Despite this, he organized what was announced as an \\"International Masonic Conference\\" in Paris on June 24, 1908, and at this conference he first met Theodor Reuss, and the two men apparently exchanged patents: Reuss elevated Encausse as X¬∞ of the Ordo Templi Orientis as well as giving him license to establish a \\"Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Ancient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris.\\" For his part, Encausse assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. Gnostic Catholic Church as a child of l'√âglise Gnostique de France, thus forming the E.G.C. within the tradition of French neo-gnosticism. When John Yarker died in 1913, Encausse was elected as his successor to the office of Grand Hierophant (international head) of the Antient and Primitive Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. ==Death== When World War I broke out, Encausse joined the French army medical corps. While working in a military hospital, he contracted tuberculosis and died in Paris on October 25, 1916, at the age of 51. == Partial bibliography == The written works of Papus (Gerard Encausse) include: * Papus (Gerard Encausse).

His story is passed down to us by 12th-century English historian William of Newburgh in his Historia rerum anglicarum, Book I, Chapter 24 entitled \\"Of bishop Wimund, his life unbecoming a bishop, and how he was deprived of his sight\\".Historia rerum anglicarum, Book 1 Ch.24, Retrieved Jan. 2005 ==Wimund's origins== William records that Wimund was \\"born in the most obscure spot in England\\". He was educated at Furness Abbey, founded 1123‚Äì1127 by the future Stephen I of England. Wimund may have been a member of the party sent from Furness to found a house at Rushen on the Isle of Man by request of the Amla√≠b mac Gofraid, the King of the Isles, in 1134.Oram, pp.182‚Äì183. King Amla√≠b granted the monks of Furness the right to elect the Bishop of the Isles, and it appears that Wimund was elected to the see during the time of Thurstan (II), Archbishop of York. Thurstan died in early 1140, so that Wimund became Bishop of the Isles in the period 1134‚Äì1140.Oram, p. 183. This was a very rapid rise for a young man of apparently obscure origins. However, as William of Newburgh relates, Wimund in time claimed to be the son of the Mormaer of Moray. William, and some later writers, doubted Wimund's claims. Modern historians have been more inclined to take this claim seriously. Some have proposed that Wimund was a son of √ìengus of Moray (died 1130), grandson of King Lulach mac Gille Coemg√°in. However, his link with Cumbria has led to the supposition that Wimund was a son (possibly illegitimate) of William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad mac Ma√≠l Coluim. William held extensive lands in Cumbria through his mother, Octreda, daughter of Cospatrick of Northumbria, and is believed to have been Mormaer or Earl of Moray between √ìengus's death in 1130 and his own death in 1147.McDonald, pp.101‚Äì102; Oram, pp. 183-186\\\\. Wimund has also been conflated with Malcolm MacHeth. ==Bishop Wimund== The following is a summary of William of Newburgh's account of the life of Bishop Wimund. Wimund's bishopric of the Isles had its seat on the Isle of Skye. The ruins of Snizort Cathedral, dedicated to Columba, are still visible near Skeabost. William of Newburgh writes that Wimund, \\"[n]ot content with the dignity of his episcopal office, he next anticipated in his mind how he might accomplish great and wonderful things; for he possessed a haughty speaking mouth with the proudest heart.\\" However, Wimund's father, if he was indeed the son of William fitz Duncan, was alive for the first seven years at least of his time as a Bishop of the Isles. So long as his father was alive, Wimund need hardly \\"[feign] himself to be the son of the earl of Moray and that he was deprived of the inheritance of his fathers by the king of Scotland\\" as William says. But William may be anticipating himself; Wimund's first conflict was not with his uncle King David, but with a fellow bishop, and there is no reason to suppose that these two conflicts were linked. During Wimund's episcopate, or shortly before its beginning, Gille Aldan was consecrated Bishop of Whithorn, probably by the agreement of Fergus of Galloway and Archbishop Thurstan, and with the approval of Pope Honorius III. The lands of the recreated Bishopric of Whithorn had probably been subject to the Bishops of the Isles, and for rival bishops to employ armed force to drive off their rivals was hardly unknown. Thus, rather than to gain his inheritance, Wimund's struggle with Gille Aldan was apparently an attempt to prevent his bishopric being partitioned in favour of a rival.Richard Oram, The Lordship of Galloway, pp. 164-76. After being captured, he was blinded, and castrated and spent the rest of his life at the monastery at Byland Abbey in North Yorkshire. ==Notes== ==References== * John of Fordun, Chronicle of the Scottish Nation.

He was the leader of the now-dissolved Rise Up Australia political party and is the president of Catch the Fire Ministries. Nalliah defended against a lawsuit brought by the Islamic Council of Victoria under Victoria's Racial and Religious Tolerance Act. In this case, Judge Michael Higgins found in favour of the Islamic Council of Victoria, which took the action against Catch the Fire, but his decision was overturned by the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nalliah used to be associated with the Australian Christian Churches. == Early years == According to his biography published by the Catch the Fire Ministries, Daniel Nalliah was born in Sri Lanka to minority Sri Lankan Tamil parents who spoke English as their first language. However, he was schooled at the Nugegoda Tamil Mahavidyalaya in Colombo, where all teaching was in done in Tamil. He was introduced to the \\"ways of God\\" by an Australian missionary. In his youth, he played at a number of night clubs in Colombo as a drummer before turning to religion. He also worked as an underground missionary in Saudi Arabia before migrating to Australia in 1997.Who is Danny Nalliah and what is Rise Up Australia SBS, 13 February 2013 After moving to Australia and founding Catch the Fire Ministries, Nalliah travelled extensively, preaching to congregations in a number of countries. He asserts that he witnessed the healing of blind, deaf and crippled people at his prayer sessions and also claims that a dead girl was resurrected after he prayed for her. ==Vilification of Muslims lawsuit== On 9 March 2002, Daniel Scot spoke at a seminar regarding Islam, sponsored by Catch the Fire Ministries. The seminar was attended by three Australian Muslims; two of them were asked to attend by May Helou, an executive member of the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) and an employee of the Equal Opportunity Commission, Victoria. The third person was asked to attend by ICV members while he was at the ICV office. The three Muslims, along with the Islamic Council of Victoria, later launched action under the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act, claiming that the intent of the speech had been to vilify Muslims rather than to discuss Islam itself. After being considered by the Equal Opportunity Commission, the case was heard by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), becoming the first real test case under the act. In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, the tribunal ruled that Nalliah, Scot and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. Judge Higgins heard further submissions regarding \\"remedies\\" early in 2005. Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the High Court of Australia. The Age newspaper quoted him as stating, \\"We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over. The law has to be removed, there is no question.\\"Historic win in religious hatred case The Age, 18 December 2004 On 22 June 2005, Judge Michael Higgins of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal delivered his final verdict on the religious vilification issue regarding remedies. He found that financial compensation would be inappropriate but ordered Nalliah and Scot to take out newspaper advertisements to the value of $68,690 that summarised the findings in the case. Nalliah criticised the ruling, comparing the legislation to \\"sharia law by stealth\\". He also said that he would rather go to jail than comply with the ruling. Lawyers for the defendants had previously appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria, in an originating motion alleging that Higgins showed signs of bias, that there were errors in the decision and that the act itself was unconstitutional. Following the decision, an appeal was lodged with the Court of Appeal, and the originating motion was dropped. The appeal was heard in August 2006. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an interfaith public interest law firm based in Washington, D.C., had intervened on Scot's behalf, engaging in discussion with the Attorney General of Australia, providing legal representation with local counsel and providing legal arguments employed for the legal appeal. On 14 December 2006, the Court of Appeal of Victoria upheld the appeal and ordered that the matter be redecided without hearing new evidence by a judge (other than Judge Higgins) of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.Court of Appeal (Supreme Court of Victoria) decision Dec 2006 - overturning VCAT decision The Islamic Council of Victoria was ordered to pay half of Scot's and Nalliah's legal costs of the appeal. The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone's rights to \\"robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society\\". == Politics / history == In November 2004, Nalliah campaigned for a seat in the Australian Senate as a candidate of the Family First Party. He was slotted second on the party's Victorian Senate list but failed to be elected. Nevertheless, his candidacy caused considerable controversy when National Party Senate candidate Barnaby Joyce launched a heavily publicised attack on Family First and his own party's preference deal with them the day before the election. Joyce highlighted a quote from one of Nalliah's brochures that asked parishioners to pray that God would pull down \\"Satan's strongholds\\", which included brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and temples (including Freemason, Buddhist and Hindu temples). Joyce used Nalliah's derogatory statements about minority groups to describe Family First as \\"not the sort of people you do preference deals with.\\"Family First close to gaining pivotal Senate role , ABC Lateline, 11-Oct-2004 In late October 2009, the Family First parliamentary leader, Senator Steve Fielding, noted that after the incident cited above Nalliah was asked to leave the party and did so. At the same time, Nalliah argued that the discovery of an adolescent \\"satanist\\" Black Mass site in Canberra's Mount Ainslie indicated that the federal parliament was \\"under attack\\" and referred to witchcraft, liberal abortion laws and legislation that supported LGBT rights in Australia as the \\"reason\\" behind an apparent spate of parliamentary marriage crises.\\"Evil spells are being cast on parliament\\", News.com.au, 12.10.09 ===Black Saturday bushfires=== In the wake of the Black Saturday bushfires, in which 173 died, Nalliah claimed he had received \\"prophetic dreams\\" on 21 October 2008 that these bushfires were a \\"consequence\\" of Victoria's decriminalisation of abortion in 2008,Pastor's abortion dream inflames bushfire tragedy, The Age, 11 February 2009Ainsley Symons (2014), 'Anti- Abortion Campaigning and the Political Process.' in Recorder (Melbourne Branch, Australian Society for the Study of Labour History), No. 279, March, pp. 2 prompting criticism from a former Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello, that Nalliah's assertion was \\"beyond the bounds of decency\\". ===Holsworthy Barracks terror plot=== Nalliah planned to use the Holsworthy Barracks terror plot as an argument to explain that Christianity should be protected \\"as the core value of the nation\\" in his speech titled \\"Is the West being de- Christianised?\\"Josephine Tovey, 10 August 2009, Sydney Morning Herald \\"Christian leaders plan anti-Islam conference\\".

It is very interesting that Kevin Rudd is from QLD. Is God trying to get our attention? Yes, I believe so.\\"Are the QLD floods the result of Kevin Rudd speaking against Israel? , Catch the Fire Ministries website, 8 January 2011 ===Rise Up Australia Party=== On 22 June 2011, Nalliah launched a new political party, Rise Up Australia, which he leads. The launch date was picked as it was the anniversary of Nalliah's successful case in the Supreme Court. Stated aims of the party include the protection of freedom of speech, freedom of religion and preserving Australia's \\"Judeo-Christian heritage\\". In a 2011 interview with Perth's Out in Perth, Nalliah stated that homosexuals can be turned back to heterosexual relationships through education and through Christ. \\"As a political party, while we love the homosexual community and want to get to know them better, we also have a stand where we say, children need to be protected. We would love to see every man and woman come together, there's a time in life when you do things, and maybe you feel yes you are locked into an agenda... [our position] is that homosexuality is not OK.\\" He also said that \\"Children should not be exposed to [public displays of homosexual affection] and other practices that go beyond morality.\\", Rise Up Australia website, 28 June 2011 ===Views on multiculturalism=== \\"We also know that Stalin and his communist ideologies were responsible for the murder of millions of people. Although communist ideologies seemed to be very good to many millions of people, the end result was much death and destruction. In other words, 'One Word' becomes a gate way to lead to great disaster if we don't wake up in time. We have seen Nazism and Communism destroy many nations. \\"So we need to take a good look at the word 'Multiculturalism'. Although this word seems to sound so good, in reality it is currently destroying the Judeo- Christian West and replacing it with an 'Interfaith' deceptive agenda led by the United Nations.

Organized as the Timi»ôoara Society and other bodies of students and workers, the signers expressed liberal-democratic goals,Baga, p.102; Neumann, p.193; Rekosh, p.141 which they saw as representing the revolutionary legacy.Cesereanu; Neumann, p.190, 193; Rekosh, p.141 The best-known requirement formed the document's 8th Point, calling for all former Romanian Communist Party nomenklatura and Securitate cadres to be banned from holding public office for a period of 10 years (or three consecutive legislatures), with an emphasis on the office of President (see Lustration).Cesereanu; Lovatt; Neumann, p.190-193; Rekosh, p.141 Questioning the status of the governing National Salvation Front, the Proclamation argued that the latter primarily represented a small group of Communist dissidents who had opposed Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's authoritarian regime and had subsequently monopolized power.Rekosh, p.141 These requirements replicated the earlier manifesto authored in Bucharest by philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu (Apel cƒÉtre , the \\"Appeal to the Scoundrels\\").Cesereanu; Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu Over the following period, the document was recognized and advocated by hundreds of civic associations, while almost 4 million citizens signed appeals in favor of incorporating the 8th Point into electoral law. The latter was also one of the main requests of the Bucharest Golaniad (which was violently repressed during the third Mineriad in June of the same year). ==Character== In its final shape, the text owed much to the inspiration of George ≈ûerban, a local academic and writer.Cesereanu; Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Neumann, p.190-196; Ripa & Istodor According to historian Victor Neumann, »òerban was in turn inspired by his collaborator Alexandra Indrie≈ü, an influential intellectual and a former political prisoner during the 1950s.Neumann, p.196 After being written down, the Proclamation was publicly read by »òerban from the National Opera's balcony.Ripa & Istodor One of the purposes stated in the document was the explicit condemnation of Communism. Proclaiming class solidarity, the text opposed \\"the typically communist method of domination by spreading feuds among social classes\\".2nd Point of the Proclamation; Neumann, p.190 While expressing the will of \\"not copy[ing] the western capitalist systems with their drawbacks and inequities\\",10th Point of the Proclamation the 10th Point of the Proclamation argued in favor of privatization (expressed ideally under the form of \\"distributing the stocks equally among the workers, the state keeping only those funds that may ensure the control of the activity\\") and immediate investments in the public sector (as a means to prevent the consequences of inflation).9th Point of the Proclamation The 11th Point also made mention of Timi»ôoara's openness to a market economy, decentralization, and foreign capital, proposing for a foreign trade bank to be opened in the city.11th Point of the Proclamation The text also expressed a hope that members of the Romanian diaspora who had left the country under the Communist regime were to return to their homeland and contribute to the society, and set itself against the portion of the public \\"who, instigated by obscure forces, abused the returned exiles\\".12th Point of the Proclamation A similar call for solidarity was expressed in regard to ethnic relations (the document stated opposition to all forms of \\"chauvinism\\", depicting Timi»ôoara as the paramount representative of \\"the spirit of tolerance and mutual respect, the sole principles reigning in the future European House\\"),4th Point of the Proclamation and a multi-party system based on free elections was endorsed, with the exclusion of \\"extremist [parties], be they leftist or rightist\\".5th Point of the Proclamation The document also proposed that the Romanian Communist Party had failed to meet the criteria for participation in Romanian politics, having \\"discredited itself by degenerating into red fascism\\". In its 7th Point, the Proclamation indicated that activists of the Communist Party had displayed \\"cowardice\\" as early as 1979, by refusing to join Constantin P√Ærvulescu in open disobedience to Ceau»ôescu.7th Point of the Proclamation The 6th point condemned \\"prejudice\\" and \\"manipulation\\" against the emerging opposition parties (specifically, the historical National Peasants' Party and National Liberals), citing examples where the \\"groups interested in resuscitating communism\\" had incited public sentiment with slogans of reportedly Stalinist inspiration.6th Point of the Proclamation Neumann attributed several of the radical social and economic goals, as well as the moral discourse associated with the 8th Point requirements, to the authors' awareness of Marxist theoriesNeumann, p.190-192 (for a certain period, George ≈ûerban had taught Marxism at the Timi»ôoara Polytechnic University).Neumann, p.191 While commending the document for thus identifying and radically condemning Communist practices, he expressed his personal opposition to the 8th Point, which he believed to be rooted in \\"Marxist historicism\\" and attempting to impose a \\"moral code\\" in \\"situations [that] call for a series of compromises\\".Neumann, p.192 A final demand regarded proposals that December 22, the date of revolutionary victory in Bucharest, be proclaimed the national holiday of Romania. The text argued against such a move, and, citing the example of Bastille Day in France, proposed December 16, when revolution broke in Timi»ôoara, as the moment of celebration.13th Point of the Proclamation Eventually, the 1991 Constitution enforced an unrelated event, Union Day (December 1), as the legal holiday. ==Aftermath== Bucharest landmark reflecting the views of Golaniad participants and proclaiming University Square as a \\"zone free from neocommunism\\" Authors have attributed the limited success of the Proclamation movement to both resistance from surviving Communist structuresBaga, p.102; Neumann, p.191-193 and the special characteristics of Timi»ôoara in relation to the rest of the country.Baga, p.102; Neumann, p.193 Victor Neumann mentioned contrasts observed during the Revolution itself, when \\"only a few cities rebelled [...] alongside Timi»ôoara: Arad, Lugoj, Sibiu, Cluj, Bra≈üov, Bucharest, Ia≈üi\\".Neumann, p.193 He attributed this pattern to political, economic and social discrepancies between various areas of the country, ones he believed to have been prolonged in post-Revolution Romania. Analyst Enik≈ë Baga contended that policy differences also remained notable between Timi»ôoara and its subordinate Timi»ô County.Baga, p.102 While commenting on the multi-ethnic character of the Revolution as mirrored in the Proclamation itself, Steven D. Roper made mention of the nationalist revival which was made obvious less than a week after the document was publicized (culminating in the ethnic clashes of T√¢rgu Mure≈ü and the creation of the Romanian National Unity Party).Roper, p.66-67 At the time, the National Salvation Front accused the Proclamation of seeking political autonomy for the Banat.Cesereanu The Proclamation of Timi»ôoara was unsuccessful in its goal of shaping electoral procedures: the presidential and legislative election of May 1990 were carried without lustration requirements. Results confirmed the victory of the National Salvation Front as ruling party and of Ion Iliescu, a former Communist official who had opposed Ceau»ôescu, as President. Despite this outcome, although reduced in amplitude, the Golaniad protests continued in Bucharest's University Square, and gave ongoing support to the Proclamation. In his previous polemic with the demonstrators, Iliescu argued that the Proclamation was likely to cause \\"a dangerous witch- hunt\\".Iliescu, in Rekosh, p.141 Leaders of the protest rejected this view, indicating that the Proclamation did not call for punishment, but rather for accurate representation. After the controversial intervention of Romanian Police forces, the Golaniad was ultimately broken up in violence by groups of miners arriving from the Jiu Valley.Rekosh, p.141-142 ==Legacy== The cause of lustration as prescribed by the Timi»ôoara 8th Point was advocated in Parliament by representatives of National Peasants' Party and National Liberal Party, but faced opposition from the governing National Salvation Front and its successor party -- which eventually grouped itself as the Social Democratic Party.Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Lovatt; Ripa & Istodor On May 27, 1999, following the elections of 1996 which confirmed the victory of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR, comprising the National Peasants' and National Liberal Party together with other groups), a legislative project seeking this goal was proposed inside the Chamber of Deputies by George ≈ûerban, elected as a National Peasants' Party member;Cioroianu, in Simitopol; Fati; Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Ripa & Istodor however, since 1997, the 8th Point was disavowed by the new President Emil Constantinescu,Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Lovatt who stressed his belief that it was \\"no longer applicable\\".Constantinescu, in Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu The project remained to be analyzed by the Chamber's Judicial Committee over the following seven months, and many of its provisions were ultimately objected to, while it failed to win a parallel verdict from Prime Minister Mugur IsƒÉrescu;Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu it was outvoted by a new Social Democratic majority in February 2001, following the 2000 elections.Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Ripa & Istodor (»òerban had died in late December 1998.) According to several commentators, the project was intentionally blocked.Fati; Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Ripa & Istodor The journal Evenimentul Zilei indicated the Social Democrat parliamentarian Dan Mar≈£ian, who served as president of the Commission and whose position was threatened by lustration, as one of those responsible for the alleged action. In the wake of the 2004 elections, confirming the victory of the Justice and Truth grouping comprising National Liberals and Democrats, lustration was again brought to the attention of Parliament. This involved two separate projects: that of National Initiative Party politicians Cozmin Gu≈üƒÉ, Lavinia »òandru and Aurelian Pavelescu was rejected in Senate (November 2005); a second one, advocated by National Liberal parliamentarians Adrian Cioroianu, Mona MuscƒÉ, Viorel Oancea, and MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ Calimente and backed by the Timi»ôoara Society, was eventually adopted by the Senate in early April 2006.\\"Legea lustra»õiei a trecut de Senat\\" It won additional backing from the Association of Former Political Prisoners and its president, Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu. Of the proposals, the former was more radical, calling for lustration to be applied permanently to all persons occupying public office under the Communist regime (whereas the National Liberal project restricts it to Communist Party and Union of Communist Youth active cadres, as well as to persons engaged in political policing in relation to the Securitate).Gheorghiu & PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôconiu; Ripa & Istodor; Simitopol At the time of its presentation to Parliament, Cioroianu stated: \\"The law will be a real test of morality for the political parties\\".Cioroianu, in Ripa & Istodor; in Simitopol In parallel, British historian Dennis Deletant has argued that lustration was intrinsically connected with the necessity for publicizing Securitate files kept by the CNSAS and the Romanian Intelligence Service.Deletant He also contrasted the manifest delays in Romanian procedures with the similar processes in three other former Eastern Bloc countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary). ==Notes== ==References== *English translation of the Proclamation * \\"Legea lustra≈£iei\\" (\\"The Law on Lustration\\"), in 22, nr.801, July 2005: **Dennis Deletant, \\"Confruntarea cu trecutul comunist\\" (\\"Confronting the Communist Past\\"), translated into Romanian by Dan Goan»õƒÉ **Anca Simitopol, \\"Un test pentru √Æntreaga clasƒÉ politicƒÉ\\" (\\"A Test for the Entire Political Establishment\\"), interview with Adrian Cioroianu * \\"Legea lustra≈£iei a trecut de Senat\\" (\\"The Lustration Law Was Passed by the Senate\\"), April 10, 2006, at HotNews.ro *Enik≈ë Baga, \\"Romania's Western Connection: Timi»ôoara and Timis County\\" [sic], in Melanie Tatur, Making Regions in Post-Socialist Europe: The Impact of Culture, Economic Straucture, and Institutions.

The compromise was designed to ensure that no employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance. Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym of this law, introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The Canada Labour Code and the labour relations laws of a majority of provinces contain provisions requiring the Rand formula when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the Rand formula mandatory, the automatic check-off of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity. > Compulsory Check-Off Union dues to be deducted 70\\\\. (1) Where a trade union > that is the bargaining agent for employees in a bargaining unit so requests, > there shall be included in the collective agreement between the trade union > and the employer of the employees a provision requiring the employer to > deduct from the wages of each employee in the unit affected by the > collective agreement, whether or not the employee is a member of the union, > the amount of the regular union dues and to remit the amount to the trade > union forthwith. Religious objections (2) Where the Board is satisfied that > an employee, because of their religious conviction or beliefs, objects to > joining a trade union or to paying regular union dues to a trade union, the > Board may order that the provision in a collective agreement requiring, as a > condition of employment, membership in a trade union or requiring the > payment of regular union dues to a trade union does not apply to that > employee so long as an amount equal to the amount of the regular union dues > is paid by the employee, either directly or by way of deduction from their > wages, to a registered charity mutually agreed on by the employee and the > trade union. Designation by Board (3) Where an employee and the trade union > are unable to agree on a registered charity for the purposes of subsection > (2), the Board may designate any such charity as the charity to which > payment should be made.Canada Labour Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. L-2) == Freedom of association issue == The Rand formula applies to all employees whether they are union members or not in those workplaces where the majority of the employees vote to form a union. The Supreme Court of Canada has found that the freedom of association is not undermined by the Rand formula.Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, 1991, 2 S.C.R. 211 In the 1991 Lavigne decision, the Justices of the Court held in various concurring reasons that if the Rand formula did violate section 2(d), it could be justified under section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as it fundamentally does no more than what is commonplace in a democratic society - the will of the majority prevails, as in the decisions of parliament, and those in the minority are bound by the decision of the majority. > I would suggest that a worker like Lavigne would have no chance of > succeeding if his objection to his association with the Union was the extent > that it addresses itself to the matters, the terms and conditions of > employment for members of his bargaining unit, with respect to which he is > \\"naturally\\" associated with his fellow employees. Few would think he should > not be required to pay for the services the Union renders him in this > context. Significantly, he does not object to these matters. With respect to > these, the Union is simply viewed as a reasonable vehicle by which the > necessary interconnections of Lavigne and his fellow workers is expressed. > When, however, the Union purports to express itself in respect to matters > reflecting aspects of Lavigne's identity and membership in the community > that go beyond his bargaining unit and its immediate concerns, his claim to > the protection of the Charter cannot as easily be dismissed. In regard to > these broader matters, his claim is not to absolute isolation but to be free > to make his own choices, unfettered by the opinion of those he works with, > as to what associations, if any, he will be associated with outside the > workplace. ==Reception== The Rand Formula has been implemented in a variety of legal contexts and although interpreted by its critics as binding businesses to violate the free choice of their employees\\"The Rand Formula in the Asbestos Decision\\", , \\"Relations Industrielles\\", 1950, and as having a negative effect in that it limits individual choice on whether or not to pay union dues in a manner incompatible with market economies it has been generally well received Randy Robinson, \\"Human Beings with Rights: Unions and Democracy in the 21st Century\\", \\"The Innovation Journal\\", 2014.

Main editorial goals include the ordering of news stories by order of importance, while graphical considerations include readability and balanced, unobtrusive incorporation of advertising. Editors work on producing an issue of Bild, 1977 in West Berlin. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. News design incorporates principles of graphic design and is taught as part of journalism training in schools and colleges. Overlapping and related terms include layout, makeup (formerly paste up) and pagination. The era of modern newspapers begins in the mid-nineteenth century, with the Industrial Revolution, and increased capacities for printing and distribution. Over time, improvements in printing technology, graphical design, and editorial standards have led to changes and improvements in the look and readability of newspapers. Nineteenth-century newspapers were often densely packed with type, often arranged vertically, with multiple headlines for each article. A number of the same technological limitations persisted until the advent of digital typesetting and pagination in late 20th century. == Process == Designers typically use desktop publishing software to arrange the elements on the pages directly. In the past, before digital pre-press pagination, designers used precise \\"lay out dummies\\" to direct the exact layout of elements for each page. A complete layout dummy was required for designating proper column widths by which a typesetter would set type, and arrange columns of text. Layout also required the calculation of lengths of copy (text in \\"column inches\\"), for any chosen width. Much of the variance and incoherence of early newspapers was because last minute corrections were exclusively handled by typesetters. With photographic printing process, typesetting gave way to paste-up, whereby columns of type were printed by machines (phototypesetters) on high-resolution film for paste-up on photographed final prints. These prints in turn were \\"shot to negative\\" with a large format production camera --directly to steel-emulsion photographic plates. Though paste-up put an end to cumbersome typesetting, this still required planned layouts and set column widths. Photographic plates are (still) wrapped on printing drums to directly apply ink to newsprint (paper). In the mid-1990s, the paste-up process gave way to the direct to plate process, where computer-paginated files were optically transmitted directly to the photographic plate. Replacing several in-between steps in newspaper production, direct to plate pagination allowed for much more flexibility and precision than before. Designers today still used column grid layouts only with layout software, such as Adobe InDesign or Quark. There five consecitive numbers 5577 those are the numbers == Design options == Designers choose photo sizes and headline sizes (both the size of the letters and how much space the headline will take). They may decide what articles will go on which pages, and where on the page, alone or in consultation with editors. They may choose typefaces for special pages, but newspapers usually have a design style that determines most routine uses. == Notable news designers == John E. Allen in Linotype News of the 1930s was the first to write extensively about the design of the U.S. press, followed at mid century by Syracuse journalism professor Edmund Arnold, sometimes identified as the father of \\"modern\\" newspaper design, and journalist Harold Evans played a key role in British news design later in the century.K.G.

It is a dialogue between a Young Man and an Old Man regarding the nature of man. The title refers to Psalm 8:4, which begins \\"what is man, that you are mindful of him...\\". It involves ideas of determinism and free will, as well as of psychological egoism. The Old Man asserts that the human being is merely a machine, and nothing more, driven by the singular purpose to satisfy his own desires and achieve peace of mind. The Young Man objects and asks him to go into particulars and furnish his reasons for his position. The work appears to be a genuine and earnest debate of his opinions about human nature, rather than satirical. Twain held views similar to that of the Old Man prior to writing \\"What is Man?\\". However, he seems to have varied in his opinions of human freedom.Twain, Mark (author), Paul Bender (editor). What Is Man? and Other Philosophical Writings, 1973, UCP, , Introduction, p. 4 ff It was published anonymously in 1906 and received such little attention Twain claimed to have regretted its publication.

It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). ==History== In summer 1920, Harold K. Needham, D. W. Kerr, and W. C. Pierce opened Southern California Bible School, an institution intended to prepare Christian workers for the various ministries of the church.

Given this new distinction, the former Southern California Bible School became Southern California Bible College, the first four-year institution of the Assemblies of God. In 1943 the college received recognition by the government for the training of military chaplains. It moved to the present campus in 1950, becoming the first four-year college in Orange County. Its name was changed to Southern California College nine years later when majors in the liberal arts were added to the curriculum. Regional accreditation and membership in the Western Association of Schools and Colleges were granted in 1964. In 1967 the college received recognition and approval of its teaching credential program from the California State Board of Education. In June 1983 the Graduate Studies Program received approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. A Degree Completion Program was started in 1994 for adult learners. On July 1, 1999, university status was achieved when Southern California College registered with the Secretary of State's Office as Vanguard University of Southern California. The university comprises the Undergraduate College and the School for Graduate and Professional Studies. ==Campus== Vanguard is in Costa Mesa, California, centrally located in Orange County and about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. Two graduate programs (organizational psychology and clinical psychology) are housed nearby at a satellite campus in Santa Ana. ==Organization and administration== In addition to its founding president, Harold K.

He left the Telegraph in May 2011 to \\"pursue a role in journalism and broadcasting\\" and \\"complete a major literary project\\". It had been speculated that his departure had been prompted by his constant attacks on David Cameron's government, of which the Telegraph had been generally supportive.Simon Heffer to leave Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, 11 May 2011 Heffer later rejoined the Daily Mail to edit a new online comment section, called RightMinds, of the paper's online edition.Simon Heffer and media ownership, BBC Radio 4, 14 September 2011 He returned to the Daily Telegraph in June 2015 and has a weekly column in the Sunday Telegraph.'Culture isn‚Äôt just nice ‚Äì it‚Äôs necessary', Daily Telegraph, 6 Jun 2015 === Historian and author === Heffer has written biographies of the historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams and of the British politician Enoch Powell (Like the Roman), which was described by the New Statesman as \\"a lucid and majestic tribute\\" to the politician.www.faber.co.uk He received his PhD in modern history from Cambridge University for the 1998 Powell biography.

On 8 February 2006, he was guest-of-honour at the Traditional Britain Group's Annual Dinner at Simpsons-in-the-Strand.The Daily Telegraph, 9 February 2006, p.22.

Heffer backed the candidacy of John Redwood, who was favoured by many of the party's right-wing members of parliament, though he preferred Michael Portillo to be party leader. He has joined calls from fellow journalist Peter Hitchens for the party to be defeated or abolished.

He was killed at the beginning of the Rwandan genocide. == Early life == Joseph Kavaruganda was born on 8 May 1935 in Tare, Ruanda-Urundi. He attended primary school in Tare, and then attended the Kigali Junior Seminary before studying law in Belgium, earning his Doctor of Philosophy in 1966. He returned to Rwanda in 1967 and took up work as a president of Caisse d'√âpargne, a credit and savings institution. == Legal career == In 1974 Kavaruganda was appointed Prosecutor General of Rwanda. As President of the Constitutional Court, Kavaruganda came into conflict with President Juv√©nal Habyarimana over legal matters. In 1991 he ruled against Habyarimana in case involving the denial certain political privileges to opposition parties which the president had allowed to his own party, the Mouvement R√©volutionaire National pour le D√©veloppement (MRND), such as the ability to broadcast positions on the state radio station, Radio Rwanda. Though a Hutu, Kavaruganda rejected the ideology of Hutu Power, which sought to discriminate against Rwanda's Tutsi population. As a lawyer, he believed that Tutsi exiles had a right to return to the country, and believed that the government should pursue negotiations with the Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). His family maintained friendships with Hutus and Tutsis. Kavaruganda came under increased pressure following his break with Habyarimana. In 1991 a bomb was detonated adjacent his bedroom at his country retreat. Soon thereafter he began receiving a steady flow of death threats from Hutu extremists. As the Rwandan Civil War dragged on, Habyarimana would negotiate with the political opposition and agree to reforms only to soon thereafter renege on them. Tired with what he perceived as obstructionism, in 1993 Kavaruganda wrote a letter to the president, listing the occasions in the previous years in which he had violated laws and broken his promises. He questioned, \\"When you violate the law, do you do it in the interest of the Rwandan people? In the spirit of the constitution? No.\\" On 4 August 1993 the Rwandan government and the RPF signed the Arusha Accords to end the Rwandan Civil War. Kavaruganda had assisted in drafting the agreement, which provoked the further ire of Hutu extremists. One edition of Kangura displayed a cartoon of him hanging from a tree with copies of the accords below him, captioned with a threat to kill him a bi-ethnic power-sharing government was installed. The Arusha Accords stipulated the investiture of an interim president and transitional government. As Chief Justice, Kavaruganda was responsible for swearing-in the officials. On the morning of 4 August Habyarimana was sworn in as interim President at the Parliament building, but then suddenly departed before calling up the new prime minister and cabinet to be inaugurated. Confused and surprised, Kavaruganda left. Habyarimana returned that afternoon with a list of new cabinet members to be sworn in from Hutu extremist parties which had not been agreed upon in the Arusha Accords. Having not been formally invited for a second ceremony, Kavaruganda did not appear and the suggested ministers were not sworn-in. Habyarimana was infuriated, and thereafter he and his political allies regarded Kavaruganda as an ally of the RPF. To assist with implementation of the Arusha Accords, the United Nations established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda and dispatched an international peacekeeping force to the country. In early February 1994 members of the Interahamwe, a Hutu extremist militia, stoned Kavaruganda's car. The following day they stormed the Constitutional Court building, but Kavaruganda and his colleagues escaped through his office window. On 17 February UNAMIR commander Rom√©o Dallaire learned that an extremist group known as the Death Escadron was planning to assassinate Tutsi politician Lando Ndasingwa and Kavaruganda. In response, Daillaire sent peacekeepers to both men's homes to protect them. Kavaruganda, his wife Annonciata, and his two children still living with him felt reassured by their presence. == Assassination == On 6April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him and triggering the start of the Rwandan genocide. Hutu extremists planned to eliminate moderate Hutu leaders across Kigali before killing Rwandan Tutsis. Kavaruganda's Kigali home was in a neighborhood where numerous government officials lived. Minister of Agriculture Fr√©d√©ric Nzamurambaho, a moderate Hutu a neighbor of Kavaruganda, telephoned him shortly after midnight on 7 April to inform him that all MRND members were being evacuated from the neighborhood. Kavaruganda then spoke briefly over the phone with his son, Jean-Marcel, who was in Brussels. Nzamurambaho called again to inform him that members of the Presidential Guard had sealed off the neighborhood, leaving only opposition party members in the area. At dawn gunfire erupted nearby and the family took shelter in their bathrooms. Some time thereafter one of the Ghanaian UN peacekeepers knocked on a window and told Kavaruganda, \\"There are military men here. They've come to take you away for safekeeping.\\" Kavaruganda went to the front door where he was met by Captain Kabera of the Presidential Guard, while about 40 Rwandan soldiers stood in the front yard and the UN peacekeepers stood on the terrace. Kabera informed him that he had orders to take him to join the opposition politicians. Stalling for time, Kavaruganda insisted on getting dressed and locked the door. He then telephoned the Belgian UN contingent and Ghanaian and Bangladeshi UN outposts, telling him his family was under attack and he needed help. The UN personnel assured him that they would send reinforcements. While Kavaruganda waited for help, Jean-Marcel telephoned to say that he heard on Belgian radio that opposition party members in Kigali were being killed and urged his father to leave. While Kavaruganda explained that he was trapped, Kabera's men broke down the front door and began searching the house. They found his daughter, Julithe, and put a gun to her head and demanded to know where her father was. She cried her help, and Kavaruganda revealed himself and insisted again on getting dressed. Kabera told him that there was no need to do so and that he had to leave right away. Kabera and the soldiers brought him outside to a waiting truck and drove away with him. The UN peacekeepers watched in the yard and did not resist. He was killed later that day.Carol Off. 2000. The Lion, the Fox, and the Eagle: A story of generals and justice in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Random House. . The remaining soldiers then harassed the family and looted their house before leaving. One of the Hutu-loyalist ministers evacuated during the night, Casimir Bizimungu, returned to the neighborhood soon thereafter to gather some things from his home. Annonciata begged him to take herself, her children, and a neighbor to the Canadian embassy, and he reluctantly did so. They were granted refuge there during the genocide. ==Footnotes== == Works cited == * Category:1935 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Hutu people Category:Rwandan judges Category:People who died in the Rwandan genocide Category:Rwandan murder victims ","title":"Joseph Kavaruganda"},{"id":"1298243","text":"Hawaiian Punch is a caffeine-free and gluten-free type of fruit punch containing 5% fruit juice. ==History== Leo's Hawaiian Punch was created as an ice cream topping syrup in 1934 by A.W. Leo, Tom Yeats, and Ralph Harrison in a converted garage in Fullerton, California. It originally contained 5 fruit juices: orange, pineapple, passion fruit, guava and papaya - all imported from Hawaii. Although customers later discovered that it made an appealing drink when mixed with water, Hawaiian Punch (with \\"Leo's\\" name omitted) was only available wholesale in gallon glass jugs to ice cream parlors and soda fountains. The original company was named Pacific Citrus Products (PCP). In 1946, Reuben P. Hughes purchased the company and renamed it the Pacific Hawaiian Products Company and quickly set about making Hawaiian Punch Base available directly to consumers in 1 quart glass containers. The immediate post-war period saw the introduction of ready-to-serve Hawaiian Punch in 46 oz tins (1950) & frozen concentrate (1955). Sometime around 1954 the brand was expanded to a 2nd flavor, Sunshine Yellow. The original red Hawaiian Punch became the \\"Rosy\\" flavor. At that same time a sixth fruit flavor, apricot puree, was added to the formula. The Sunshine Yellow flavor omitted the orange juice of the original and replaced the original red food coloring with yellow. By 1955 Hawaiian Punch had become a national brand. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company bought Pacific Hawaiian in 1962 and later transferred it to its newly acquired Del Monte subsidiary in 1981. Procter & Gamble bought Hawaiian Punch from Del Monte Foods, spun off from RJR Nabisco in 1989, a year later. Procter & Gamble sold Hawaiian Punch to Cadbury Schweppes in 1999. Dr Pepper Snapple was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008. In 2018 Dr Pepper Snapple merged with Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper. ==Mascot== In 1961, the Atherton-Privett ad agency created a 20-second commercial to advertise Hawaiian Punch drink. The commercial was produced by John Urie and Associates in Hollywood. Jean Guy Jacques was the director; Bob Guidi and John Urie designed the two characters, Punchy and Oaf. Ross Martin did Punchy's voice, \\"Hey! How 'bout a nice Hawaiian Punch?\\" and John Urie did Oaf's line, \\"Sure\\". Rod Scribner animated the commercials. Sam Cornell also worked on the later versions. Oaf never learned to say \\"No\\" and he was always punched. The commercial ended with Punchy leaning on a can of Hawaiian Punch, saying, \\"Wasn't that a refreshing commercial?\\" The commercial won many awards. After airing in February 1962 on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar, the Punchy commercial was so special that Jack Paar said, \\"Let's play that again... the second time is free.\\" The Punchy and Oaf characters were used in the product's commercials well into the 1980s, and again for a period in the early 1990s. ==Flavors== ===Original Syrup=== * Leo's Hawaiian Punch (became Hawaiian Punch, but the original consumer product in 1946 was called Hawaiian Punch Base) ===Original canned flavors=== * Rosy Red (later Fruit Juicy) * Sunshine Yellow ===2 additional flavors by 1966=== * Orange * Grape (Sunshine Yellow contained banana puree by 1966) ===Other flavors 1967 & later=== * Cherry * Strawberry * Lemonade ===Added 1969=== * Fruit Juicy Red Low Calorie ===Added 1971=== * Cherry Royal ===1975 canned flavors=== * Fruit Juicy Red * Great Grape * Sunshine Orange * Tropical Fruit * Very Berry * Fruit Punch Low Sugar ===1975 \\"Drink Mix\\" flavors=== *Red Punch *Strawberry Punch *Tutti Frutti Punch ===Post-1980 canned flavors=== * Fruit Juicy Red * Fruit Juicy Red Light * Green Berry Rush: strawberry and kiwi * Mazin' Melon Mix: melon * Bodacious Berry: berry * Orange Ocean: orange * Wild Purple Smash: grape and berry * Lemonade: old-fashioned lemonade * Berry Blue Typhoon: strawberry, blueberry, raspberry and kiwi * Berry Bonkers: strawberry, blueberry, raspberry and pomegranate * Lemon Berry Squeeze: strawberry and lemonade * Berry Limeade Blast: strawberry and limeade * Lemon Lime Splash: lemon and lime * Island Citrus Guava: guava and lime * Polar Blast: orange and raspberry * Mango Passionfruit Squeeze: mango and passion fruit * Mango Monsoon: orange, mango and pineapple * White Water Wave: coconut and pineapple * Watermelon Berry Boom: strawberry and watermelon === Product flavor facts since 2020 === The following fruit flavors are offered by Keurig Dr Pepper: * Hawaiian Punch Berry Blue Typhoon Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Berry Bonkers Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Berry Limeade Blast Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red Juice Drink ** The current Fruity Juicy Red formulation is composed of seven fruit flavors: apple, apricot, guava, orange, papaya, passion fruit, and pineapple. * Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red Juice Drink Light * Hawaiian Punch Green Berry Rush Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Lemon Berry Squeeze Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Lemon Lime Splash Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Lemonade Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Mango Monsoon Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Orange Ocean Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Punch Polar Blast Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Watermelon Berry Boom Juice Drink * Hawaiian Punch Whitewater Wave Juice Drink == In video game == Hawaiian Punch also featured in Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis theme park maker video game in the Kiosk and Rest Area. ==References== == External links == * *History of Hawaiian Punch Category:Keurig Dr Pepper brands Category:Juice brands Category:Products introduced in 1934 ","title":"Hawaiian Punch"},{"id":"1298256","text":"XBin, or eXtended Binary, is a file format for saving IBM PC text mode images.

XBin stores its width information internally so that a programmer or user does not need to define this information more than once, an inherent problem with plain BIN files.

Idle asks Jones a series of questions about his romantic relationships that seem odd and cryptic, but that are eventually revealed to be complex double entendres. Jones becomes irritated by the line of questioning and asks Idle, directly, what he is implying. Idle forwardly admits that he really wants to know whether Jones has ever \\"slept with a lady.\\" When Jones directly answers \\"Yes,\\" Idle curiously asks him, \\"What's it like?\\" This conclusion makes it one of the few Monty Python sketches to end on a clear punch line. ==In other Monty Python material== The sketch appears in the 1971 spin-off feature film, And Now for Something Completely Different and the 1982 concert film Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl. It was also performed when the Pythons appeared on The Midnight Special and was recorded for the 1976 concert album Monty Python Live at City Center. In its original airing on Monty Python's Flying Circus, the sketch was preceded by a short link in which Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin portray schoolboys being interviewed for television by John Cleese. During the interview, Idle announces that he's written a sketch called \\"Nudge Nudge\\". In And Now for Something Completely Different, the sketch is followed by a cut to a scene in a gym, where Terry Gilliam dressed as a nun on an ergometer replies (dubbed by a female voice), \\"I think it's overrated.\\" Then, the \\"Self Defence Against Fresh Fruit\\" sketch is played in the setting. Idle's character in the pub makes several cameo appearances in later episodes, referred to as \\"Arthur Name\\". In Monty Python Live (Mostly), the sketch segues from \\"Albatross\\". In the background, a piano version of \\"Never Be Rude to an Arab\\" is heard. Eventually the sketch segues into a new opening title song for Blackmail which incorporates samples of Idle's Nudge, Nudge dialogue. ==History== Originally written by Eric Idle for Ronnie Barker in another comedy show,Identified as \\"the ITV Frost\\" by Eric Idle in The Pythons Autobiography By The Pythons, Orion Books, 2003, , page 138. Though not given by Idle, the actual title of the show was Frost on Sunday. the sketch was then rejected as a script.Idle, Eric. Interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program 7.30 Report, 28 November 2007. Eric Idle openly admits the script is confusing, the joke being mostly in the delivery. ==Reception== The phrases, \\"nudge nudge\\" and \\"wink wink\\", are part of the English lexicon as idiomatic phrases implying sexual innuendo. Elvis Presley was a great fan of Monty Python. In an extra on the Rutles DVD, Idle states that \\"Nudge Nudge\\" was Presley's favourite Python sketch. Idle reprised the sketch in TV advertisements for Breakaway and Nudge chocolate bars, with the punch line changed to include the product name.

It is believed to be established by Mansa Musahttps://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sankore-mosque-and- university-c-1100/, who was the ruler of the Mali Empire. In The three mosques of Sankor√©, Djinguereber and Sidi Yahya compose the University of Timbuktu. Madrasah (ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ©) means school/university in Arabic and also in other languages that have been influenced by Islam. ==History== Edmond Fortier with the mosque in 1905‚Äì06 The University of Sankore has its roots in the Sankore Mosque which was founded in 989 AD by Al-Qadi Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar, the Supreme Judge of Timbuktu. The Sankore University prospered and became a very significant seat of learning in the Muslim world, especially under the reign of Mansa Musa (1307‚Äì1332) and the Askia Dynasty (1493‚Äì1591). ===Growth as a center of learning=== Timbuktu had long been a destination or stop for merchants from the Middle East and North Africa. It wasn't long before ideas as well as merchandise began passing through the fabled city. Since most if not all these traders were Muslim, the mosque would see visitors constantly. The temple accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world becoming not only a center of worship but a center of learning. Books became more valuable than any other commodity in the city, and private libraries sprouted up in the homes of local scholars. ===Apex=== By the end of Mansa Musa's reign (early 14th century CE), the Sankor√© Masjid had been converted into a fully staffed Madrassa (Islamic school or in this case university) with the largest collections of books in Africa since the Library of Alexandria. The level of learning at Timbuktu's Sankor√© University was superior to that of many other Islamic centers in the world. The Sankor√© Masjid was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with between 400,000 and 700,000 manuscripts.See ==Organization== As the center of an Islamic scholarly community, the University was very different in organization from the universities of medieval Europe. It had no central administration other than the Emperor. It had no student registers but kept copies of its students' publishing. It was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or imam. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyard of the mosque or at private residences. ==Curriculum== The curriculum of Sankor√© and other masjids in the area had four levels of schooling or \\"degrees\\". On graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their mastery. The schooling was not secular as arguments that could not be backed by the Qur'an were inadmissible in debates. However, secular teaching (geometry, mathematics) were included and stressed to develop well-rounded individuals. ===Qur'anic School=== The first or primary degree (Qur'anic school) required a mastery of Arabic and certain African languages and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur'an. Students were also introduced to basic sciences at this level. ===General Studies=== The secondary degree or General Studies degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences. Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learnings of the Qur'an. At this level they learned Hadiths, jurisprudence and the sciences of spiritual purification according to Islam. Finally, they began an introduction to trade school and business ethics. On graduation day, students were given turbans symbolizing Divine light, wisdom, knowledge and excellent moral conduct. After receiving their diplomas the students would gather outside the examination building or the main campus library and throw their turbans high into the air cheering and holding each other's hands to show that they were all brothers and sisters.See and ===Superior Degree=== The Superior degree required students to study under specialized professors doing research work. Much of the learning centered on debates to philosophic or religious questions. Before graduating from this level, students attached themselves to a Sheik (Islamic teacher) and demonstrated a strong character. ===Alumni Level=== The last level of learning at Sankor√© or any of the Masjids was the level of Judge or Professor. These men worked mainly as judges for the city and eventually the region dispersing learned men to all the principal cities in Mali. A third level student who had impressed his Sheik enough was admitted into a \\"circle of knowledge\\" and valued as a truly learned individual and expert in his field. The members of this scholar's club were the equivalent of tenured professors. Those who did not leave Timbuktu remained there to teach or counsel the leading people of the region on important legal and religious matters. They would receive questions from the region's powerful (kings or governors) and distribute them to the third level students as research assignments. After discussing the findings among themselves, the scholars would issue a fatwa on the best way to deal with the problem at hand. ==Scholars of Sankor√© == Scholars wrote their own books as part of a socioeconomic model. Students were charged with copying these books and any other books they could get their hands on. Today there are over 700,000 manuscripts in Timbuktu with many dating back to West Africa's Golden Age (12th to 16th centuries). *Ahmed Baba *Mohammed Bagayogo *Modibo Mohammed Al Kaburi ==See also== *Ancient university *List of oldest universities in continuous operation *Medieval university *Songhai Empire *Timbuktu Manuscripts Project ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * *Ancient Manuscripts from the Desert Libraries of Timbuktu, Library of Congress ‚Äî exhibition of manuscripts from the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library Category:980s establishments Category:History of Mali Category:History of Azawad Category:Madrasas in Mali Category:Medieval Islam Category:Mali Empire Category:African architecture Category:Universities in Mali Category:10th-century establishments in Africa Category:Timbuktu Category:Educational institutions established in the 10th century ","title":"Sankore Madrasah"},{"id":"1298266","text":"Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin Rinpoche (1921‚Äì2004) was a scholar of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. ==References== * SERMEY KHENSUR LOBSANG THARCHIN RINPOCHE: 1921-2004 Category:Lamas Category:1921 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Rinpoches Category:Gelug Lamas ","title":"Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin"},{"id":"1298270","text":"Cherie is the 2004 debut album by the French pop and dance music artist Cherie.

In modern usage it refers to any type of underfloor heating, or to a hotel or a sleeping room in Korean (as opposed to Western) style. The main components of the traditional ondol are an agungi (firebox or stove) accessible from an adjoining room (typically kitchen or master bedroom), a raised masonry floor underlain by horizontal smoke passages, and a vertical, freestanding chimney on the opposite exterior wall providing a draft. The heated floor, supported by stone piers or baffles to distribute the smoke, is covered by stone slabs, clay and an impervious layer such as oiled paper. ==History== ===Origin=== Use of the ondol has been found at archaeological sites in present-day North Korea. A Neolithic Age archaeological site, circa 5000 BC, discovered in Unggi, Hamgyeongbuk-do, in present-day North Korea, shows a clear vestige of gudeul in the excavated dwelling (). Early ondols began as gudeul that provided the heating for a home and for cooking. When a fire was lit in the furnace to cook rice for dinner, the flame would extend horizontally because the flue entry was beside the furnace. This arrangement was essential, as it would not allow the smoke to travel upward, which would cause the flame to go out too soon. As the flame would pass through the flue entrance, it would be guided through the network of passages with the smoke. Entire rooms would be built on the furnace flue to create ondol floored rooms. ===Etymology=== The term gudeul is a native Korean word. According to a Korean folkloric historian Son Jintae (1900 - missing during the 1950-53 Korean War), gudeul originated from guun-dol (Korean), which means \\"heated stone\\", and its pronunciation has changed into gudol or gudul, and again into gudeul. The term ondol is Sino-Korean and was introduced around the end of the 19th century. Alternate names include (janggaeng (), hwagaeng (), nandol (), and yeondol ()). ==Use== Ondol had traditionally been used as a living space for sitting, eating, sleeping and other pastimes in most Korean homes before the 1960s. Koreans are accustomed to sitting and sleeping on the floor, and working and eating at low tables instead of raised tables with chairs. The furnace burned mainly rice paddy straws, agricultural crop waste, biomass or any kind of dried firewood. For short-term cooking, rice paddy straws or crop waste was preferred, while long hours of cooking and floor heating needed longer-burning firewood. Unlike modern-day water heaters, the fuel was either sporadically or regularly burned (two to five times a day), depending on frequency of cooking and seasonal weather conditions. With the traditional ondol heating, the floor closer to the furnace was normally warm enough, and the warmest spots reserved for elders and honored guests. Ondol had problems such as environmental pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning coal briquettes. Thus, other technology heats modern Korean homes. The famous American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, was building a hotel in Japan, and was invited to a Japanese family's house. The homeowner had experienced the ondol in Korea, and he built an ondol room in his house. Wright reportedly was so impressed that he invented radiant floor heating which uses hot water as the heating medium. Some of Wright's buildings employed this system. Instead of ondol-hydronic radiant floor heating, modern- day houses such as high-rise apartments have a modernized version of the ondol system. Many architects know the advantages and benefits of ondol, and they are using ondol in modern houses. Since the ondol has been introduced to many countries, it is beginning to be considered as one of the systems of home heating. Modern ondol are not same as the original version. Almost all Koreans use modern versions, so it is hard to find the traditional ondol system in Korean houses. Image:Korea-Gangneung-Seongyojang-02.jpgHigh exhaust vents jutting sideways Image:Korea-Unhyeongung-06.jpgChimney for fumes Image:Korea- Unhyeongung-03.jpgChimney Image:Korea-Seoul-Namsangol-03.jpgExhaust vents as sideways-oriented pipes ==Advantages and disadvantages== One of the advantages of an Ondol is that it can maintain heat for an extended period. In a traditional Korean house, people usually extinguish the fire before going to sleep at night, since it can stay warm until the morning. An ondol conducts heat evenly throughout the whole room, although the part of the room closest to the agungi is much warmer. Comparing the Ondol with the Western radiator: the heat from the radiator rises towards the ceiling, but Ondol keeps both the floor and the air in the room warm. The advantage of the Ondol is that people do not have to worry about breakdown and repair of the Ondol. The Ondol is part of the house, therefore, it is less likely to run into problems. Any combustible materials can be used as fuel for the Ondol; there are no special fuel requirements. In contrast to heaters, such as fireplaces or charcoal- based heaters that leave ash in the room, Ondol does not cause pollution in the room leaving it clean and warm. The Ondol has some disadvantages. Mud and stones are one of the main materials that make up the Ondol. Such materials take quite a long time to heat up, therefore the room takes a long time to warm up. In addition, it is difficult to adjust the temperature of the room. In the 1970s and 80s, soldiers stationed at Camp Casey, Korea, were allowed to have off-post facilities after written approval of the local commander. But, the facilities had to pass carbon monoxide inspections every six months if they were heated by ondol (charcoal or wood). A non-Commissioned Officer from the soldier's unit would prepare a film canister to hold a diesel soaked piece of cloth. The NCO would place the fuel-soaked rag on the top of the charcoal and close the heater. The black smoke would travel under the floor and exit the flue. However, any leaks in the floor would allow black smoke to seep into the room. This would be the same pathway that the deadly carbon monoxide would get into the living quarters, putting the occupants at risk. Certification of safe testing was the minimum due diligence on the part of command. ==Dol bed== The dol bed, or stone bed, is a manufactured bed that has the same heating effect as ondol. The dol bed industry is estimated to be worth 100 billion Korean won, comprising 30 to 40 percent of the entire bed industry in South Korea; dol beds are most popular with middle-aged people in their 40s and 50s. ==See also== *Underfloor heating *Korean architecture *List of Korea-related topics *Culture of Korea *Hypocaust *Rocket mass heater *Gloria (heating system) *Kang bed-stove *Masonry heater *Frank Lloyd Wright ==References== ==External links== *The Herbert Offen Research Collection of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum Category:Korean architecture Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Energy in South Korea Category:Korean culture Category:Korean inventions Category:Residential heating appliances ","title":"Ondol"},{"id":"1298284","text":"Founder of the movement. The Faraizi movement () was a movement led by Haji Shariatullah in Eastern Bengal to give up un-Islamic practices and act upon their duties as Muslims (fard). Founded in 1819, the movement protected the rights of tenants to a great extent. == Views == The Faraizis adhered to the Hanafi school with certain differences in practices. * Tawbah i.e. to be penitent for past sins as a measure for the purification of soul * To observe strictly the obligatory duties of Faraiz * Strict adherence to Tawhid * India being Dar al Harb, Friday prayers and Eid prayers were not obligatory. * Denouncing all cultural rites and ceremonies, which had no reference to the Quran and Sunnah, as bidah or sinful innovations The leader of the Faraizis was called Ustad or teacher, and his disciples xagird or students, instead of using the terms like pir and murid. A person so initiated into the Faraizi fold was called Tawbar Muslim or Mumin. It was a religious reform movement founded in rural areas of East Bengal. It was initially peaceful but later turned violent. The basic aim was to discard un Islamic practices. its epicentre was in Faridpur. ==Reception== The Faraizi movement was widely received in the districts of Dhaka, Faridpur, Barisal, Mymensingh and Comilla. Some Muslims, on the other hand, particularly the landlords of Dhaka, hence, reacted sharply against him, which caused a riot in Nayabari, Dhaka District. Due to the reaction of these landlords and Hindu landlords and European indigo planters, this movement swelled into a socio-economic issue. The landlords levied numerous abwabs (plural form of the Arabic term bab, signifying a door, a section, a chapter, a title). During Mughal India, all temporary and conditional taxes and impositions levied by the government over and above regular taxes were referred to as abwabs. More explicitly, abwab stood for all irregular impositions on Raiyats above the established assessment of land in the Pargana. Such abwabs were horribly dishonest in the eye of law. Several abwabs were of a religious nature. Haji Shariatullah then intervened to object to such a practice and commanded his disciples not to pay these dishonest cesses to the landlords. The landlords even inflicted a ban on the slaughter of cows, especially on the occasion of Eid. The Faraizis ordained their peasant followers not to obey such a ban. All these heated instances added up to tensed and stressed relationships amongst the Faraizis and the landlords, who were all Hindus. The Islamic-led Faraizi movement could be witnessed in various parts of Bengal, with overwhelming English-Bengali agreement for perhaps the very first time. The outraged landlords built up a propaganda campaign with the British officials, incriminating the Faraizis with a mutinous mood. In 1837, these Hindu landlords indicted Haji Shariatullah of attempting to build up a kingdom of his own. They also brought several lawsuits against the Faraizis, in which they benefitted dynamic co-operation of the European indigo planters. Shariatullah was placed under the detention of the police in more than one instance, for purportedly inciting agrarian turbulence in Faridpur. == Succession == After the death of Haji Shariatullah, his son, Dudu Miyan, led the movement to a more agrarian character. He organised the oppressed peasantry against the oppressive landlords. In retaliation, the landlords and indigo planters tried to contain Dudu Miyan by instituting false cases against him. However, he became so popular with the peasantry that in the cases, courts seldom found a witness against Dudu Miyan. The initial victories of Dudu Miyan captured the imagination of the masses and Haji sahib the greta sought Dudu Miyan's protection against the oppressive landlords. Dudu Miyan died in 1862 and before his death he had appointed a board of guardians to look after his minor sons, Ghiyasuddin Haydar and Abdul Gafur alias Naya Miyan who succeeded him successively. The board, with great difficulty, kept the dwindling movement from falling to pieces. It was not until Naya Miyan attained maturity that it regained some of its lost strength. Nabinchandra Sen, the then sub-divisional officer of Madaripur District, thought it prudent to enter into an alliance of mutual help with the Faraizi leaders, who, in their turn, showed a spirit of co-operation towards the government. On the death of Naya Miyan in 1884, the third and the youngest son of Dudu Miyan, Syeduddin Ahmad was acclaimed leader by the Faraizis. During this time, the conflict of the Faraizis with the Taiyunis, another reformist group reached the climax and religious debates between the two schools of thought had become a commonplace occurrence in East Bengal. He was bestowed with the title of Khan Bahadur by the government. In 1905, on the question of the partition of Bengal, he lent support to Nawab Salimullah in favour of partition, but he died in 1906. Khan Bahadur Syeduddin was succeeded by his eldest son Rashiduddin Ahmad alias Badshah Miyan. During the early years of his leadership, Badshah Miyan maintained the policy of co-operation towards the government. However, the annulment of the partition of Bengal made him anti-British and he took part in the Khilafat and non-co-operation movements. Soon after the establishment of Pakistan he summoned a conference of the Faraizis at Narayanganj and declared Pakistan as Dar-ul-Islam and gave permission to his followers to hold the congregational prayers of Jum'ah and Eid. ==See also== *Anjuman-i-Ulama-i-Bangala ==References== == External links == * Faraizi Movement 1830‚Äì57 at Storyofpakistan.com Category:Islamism in India Category:History of Bengal Category:Protests in British India Category:Political history of India Category:1818 establishments in India Category:Religious organizations established in 1818 Category:History of Bangladesh Category:19th-century Islam ","title":"Faraizi movement"},{"id":"1298313","text":"Christopher Robin Milne (21 August 1920 ‚Äì 20 April 1996) was an English author and bookseller and the only child of author A. A. Milne. As a child, he was the basis of the character Christopher Robin in his father's Winnie-the-Pooh stories and in two books of poems. ==Early life== Christopher Robin Milne was born at 11 Mallord Street, Chelsea, London, on 21 August 1920, to author Alan Alexander Milne and Daphne (n√©e de S√©lincourt) Milne. Milne speculated that he was an only child because \\"he had been a long time coming.\\" From an early age, Milne was cared for by his nanny Olive Brockwell, until May 1930, when he entered boarding school. Milne called her Nou, and stated \\"Apart from her fortnight's holiday every September, we had not been out of each other's sight for more than a few hours at a time\\", and \\"we lived together in a large nursery on the top floor.\\" Milne's father explained that Rosemary was the intended name for their first born, if a girl. Realizing that it was going to be a boy, he decided on Billy, but without the intention of actually christening him William. Instead, each parent chose a name, hence his legal name Christopher Robin. He was referred to within the family as Billy Moon, a combination of his nickname and his childhood mispronunciation of Milne. From 1929 onwards, he would be referred to simply as Christopher, and he later stated it was \\"The only name I feel to be really mine.\\" The real stuffed toys owned by Christopher Robin Milne and featured in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. They have been on display in the New York Public Library in New York City since 1987, with the exception of Roo, who was lost when Christopher Robin was 9 years old. According to the New York Public Library's web site, the items have been on display in the Children's Center at 42nd Street, in the \\"main branch\\" of the library (the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street) since early 2009. At his first birthday on 21 August 1921, Milne received an Alpha Farnell teddy bear, which he later named Edward. Eeyore was a Christmas present in 1921 and Piglet arrived undated. Edward, along with a real Canadian black bear named Winnipeg that Milne saw at London Zoo, eventually became the inspiration for the Winnie-the-Pooh character. Milne spoke self-deprecatingly of his own intellect, \\"I may have been on the dim side\\", or \\"not very bright\\". He also described himself as being \\"good with his hands\\", and possessing a Meccano set. His self-descriptions included \\"girlish\\", since he had long hair and wore \\"girlish clothes\\", and being \\"very shy and 'un-self-possessed'\\". An early childhood friend was Anne Darlington, also an only child, who as Milne described it, was for his parents \\"the Rosemary that I wasn't.\\" Anne Darlington had a toy monkey, Jumbo, as dear to her as Pooh was to Christopher. Several poems by Milne, and several illustrations by E. H. Shepard, feature Anne and Christopher, notably \\"Buttercup Days\\", in which their relative hair colours (brown and golden blond) and their mutual affection is noted (the illustration to this latter poem, from Now We Are Six, also features the cottage at Cotchford Farm). To Alan and Daphne Milne, Anne was and remained to her death the Rosemary that Christopher wasn't, and Daphne long held fond hopes that Anne and Christopher would marry. In 1925, Milne's father bought Cotchford Farm, near the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex. Though still living in London, the family would spend weekends, Easter, and summer holidays there. As Milne described it, \\"So there we were in 1925 with a cottage, a little bit of garden, a lot of jungle, two fields, a river, and then all the green, hilly countryside beyond, meadows and woods, waiting to be explored.\\" The place became the inspiration for fiction, with Milne stating, \\"Gill's Lap that inspired Galleon's Lap, the group of pine trees on the other side of the main road that became the Six Pine Trees, the bridge over the river at Posingford that became Pooh-sticks Bridge,\\" and a nearby \\"ancient walnut tree\\" became Pooh's House. His toys, Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, plus two invented characters, Owl and Rabbit, came to life through Milne and his mother, to the point where his father could write stories about them. Kanga, Roo, and Tigger were later presents from his parents. Of this time, Milne states, \\"I loved my Nanny, I loved Cotchford. I also quite liked being Christopher Robin and being famous.\\" When his nanny departed when he was age 9, Milne's relationship with his father grew. As he put it, \\"For nearly ten years I had clung to Nanny. For nearly ten more years I was to cling to him, adoring him as I had adored Nanny, so that he too became almost a part of me ...\\" When Milne eventually wrote his memoirs, he dedicated them to Olive Brockwell, \\"Alice to millions, but Nou to me\\". ===Schooling=== At age 6, Milne and Anne Darlington attended Miss Walters' school. On 15 January 1929, Milne started at Gibbs, a boys' day school in Sloane Square, London. In May 1930, he started boarding school at Boxgrove School near Guildford. Of his time at boarding school, Milne said, \\"For it was now that began that love-hate relationship with my fictional namesake that has continued to this day.\\"His father's books were popular meaning they were well known by his schoolmates, which made Milne a target of bullying by the other children. Milne later described the poem \\"Vespers\\" ‚Äì about the toddler Christopher Robin saying his evening prayers ‚Äì as \\"the one [work] that has brought me over the years more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment than any other.\\" Milne earned a mathematics scholarship at Stowe School where he was relentlessly bullied and wrote: \\"It seemed to me almost that my father had got to where he was by climbing upon my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with the empty fame of being his son.\\" He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1939. ==Adult life== When World War II broke out, Milne left his studies and tried to join the army, but failed the medical examination. His father used his influence to get Milne a position as a sapper with the second training battalion of the Royal Engineers. He received his commission in July 1942 and was posted to the Middle East and Italy; where he was later wounded as a platoon commander the following year. After the war, he returned to Cambridge and completed a degree in English literature. On 11 April 1948, Milne became engaged to Lesley de S√©lincourt, a cousin on his mother's side, and they married on 24 July 1948. In 1951, he and his wife moved to Dartmouth and opened up the Harbour Bookshop on 25 August (Closed at the end of September 2011). This turned out to be a success, although his mother had thought the decision odd, as Milne did not seem to like \\"business\\", and as a bookseller he would regularly have to meet Pooh fans. Milne occasionally visited his father when the elder Milne became ill. After his father died, Milne never returned to Cotchford Farm. His mother eventually sold the farm and moved back to London, after disposing of his father's personal possessions. Milne, who did not want any part of his father's royalties, decided to write a book about his childhood. As Milne describes it, that book, The Enchanted Places, \\"combined to lift me from under the shadow of my father and of Christopher Robin, and to my surprise and pleasure I found myself standing beside them in the sunshine able to look them both in the eye.\\" Following her husband's death, Daphne Milne had little further contact with her son, did not see him during the last 15 years of her life and refused to see him on her deathbed.Thwaite, p. 485Thwaite, p. 542 A few months after his father's death in 1956, Christopher Milne's daughter Clare was born and diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy. Milne gave the original stuffed animals that inspired the Pooh characters to the books' editor, who in turn donated them to the New York Public Library; Marjorie Taylor (in her book Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them) recounts how many were disappointed at this, and Milne had to explain that he preferred to concentrate on the things that currently interested him. He disliked the idea of Winnie-the-Pooh being commercialised. ===Death=== Milne lived for some years with myasthenia gravis, and died in his sleep on 20 April 1996 in Totnes, Devon, aged 75. After his death he was described by one newspaper as a \\"dedicated atheist\\".\\"The books live on. But in real life Toad is dead; Alice is dead; Peter Pan and Wendy are long flown; and now Christopher Robin, a 'sweet and decent' man who overcame a childhood in which he was haunted by Pooh and taunted by peers, has left without saying his prayers ‚Äì he was a dedicated atheist ‚Äì aged 75.\\" Euan Ferguson, 'Robin's gone, but swallows linger on,' The Observer, 28 April 1996, News, p. 14. ==Family== Milne had one child, a daughter named Clare, who had cerebral palsy. In adult life, she led several charitable campaigns for the condition, including the Clare Milne Trust. She died in 2012 at the age of 56 of a heart abnormality. ==Portrayal== Milne is portrayed by Will Tilston and Alex Lawther in Goodbye Christopher Robin, a 2017 film \\"inspired by\\" his relationship with his father. ==Bibliography== * The Enchanted Places (Methuen, 1974) * Path Through the Trees (Dutton, 1979) * Hollow on the Hill (Methuen, 1982) * The Windfall (Methuen, 1985) * The Open Garden (Methuen, 1988) ==Sources== * Thwaite, Ann (1990).

A meterstickMeterstick  Definition of Meterstick by Merriam-Webster or yardstickYardstick  Definition of Yardstick by Merriam-Webster is either a straightedge or foldable ruler used to measure length, and is especially common in the construction industry. They are often made of wood or plastic, and often have metal or plastic joints so that they can be folded together. Normal length of a meterstick made for the international market is either one or two meters, while a yardstick made for the U.S. market is typically one yard (3 feet or 0.9144 meters) long. Metersticks are usually divided with lines for each millimeter (1000 per meter) and numerical markings per centimeter (100 per meter), with numbers either in centi- or millimeter. Yardsticks are most often marked with a scale in inches, but sometimes also feature marks for foot increments. Hybrid sticks with more than one measurement system also exist, most notably those which have metric measurements on one side and U.S. customary units on the other side (or both on the same side). The \\"tumstock\\" (literally \\"thumbstick\\", meaning \\"inch- stick\\") invented in 1883 by the Swedish engineer Karl-Hilmer Johansson Koll√©n was the first such hybrid stick, and was developed with the goal to help Sweden convert to the metric system. ==Construction== Metersticks are often thin and rectangular, and made of wood or metal. Metal ones are often backed with a 'grippy' material, such as cork, to improve friction. They are relatively cheap, with most wood models costing under 5 US dollars. ==Measurements== Two wooden yardsticks with brass ends, in inches and division of yard for half, quarter, eighth and sixteenth. A folding meterstick carpenter's ruler with millimeter divisions and numbers in centimeters. Fully extended it measures 2 meters. In countries in which the metric system is used (all countries except Liberia, Myanmar and United States), hybrid sticks bearing imperial units markings on one side (three feet in with inch and fractional inch) and metric units on the other (one meter with 100 centimeters and 1000 millimeters) are common, and are sometimes referred to as yardsticks, metersticks or \\"meter rulers\\". The spelling meter vs metre varies by country. Sometimes the imperial units are not included. Although not used as often, metersticks can be found in the United States. For example, they are common in schools where there is a desire for students to become familiar with metric units. They may also be used in American science labs. The folding carpenters' rulers used in Scandinavia are sometimes equipped with double measurements, metric and imperial on both sides, also functioning as a handy conversion table, accounting for its Scandinavian term: Tommestokk/tumstock (thumb (inch) stick),NRK: Teknologi og design: Verkt√∏yskapet (website in Norwegian) a term with the same meaning that is also used in Dutch: duimstok. Metric only carpenter's rulers are however common. ==Application== The meterstick is usually employed for work on a medium scale; larger than desktop work on paper, yet smaller than large scale infrastructure work, where tape measures or longer measuring rods are used. Typical applications of metersticks are for building furniture, vehicles and houses. Modern carpenters' metersticks are usually made to be folded for ease of transport. Metersticks may be used as pointing devices for posters and projections. Metersticks are also used as spars to make wings for remote controlled model aircraft that are made from corrugated plastic. Metersticks also can be used as melee weapons, especially in classrooms. ==References== Category:Length, distance, or range measuring devices Category:Melee_weapons ","title":"Meterstick"},{"id":"1298330","text":", formerly , is a Japanese voice actress, singer and gravure idol.

Most of his career he played for his home town club, Ajax, and he became a coach after retirement. Regarded as one of the best defenders of all time, Krol mainly played as a sweeper or left-back, however he could play anywhere across the back line, or in midfield as a defensive midfielder, due to his range of passing with both feet, temperament, tactical intelligence, and ability to start attacking plays after winning back the ball.Krol, a Dutch legend in Africa FIFA.com ==Playing career== ===Club=== He began his career at Ajax under manager Rinus Michels. In his first season at the club he did not play much. After the departure of left back Theo van Duivenbode in the summer of 1969 to Feyenoord, Krol became a regular player. When Ajax reached the UEFA European Cup in 1971, and won, Krol did not play because of a broken leg. Krol did play in the European Cup finals of 1972 and 1973. While others such as Johan Cruijff and Johan Neeskens left for new pastures, Krol, captain since the departure of Piet Keizer in October 1974, stayed at Ajax until June 1980. He moved to the North American Soccer League to play for the Vancouver WhitecapsRuud Krol. Planetworldcup.com. for one season. He then joined S.S.C. Napoli where he played for the next four seasons. His last club before he retired in 1986 was the French club AS Cannes, at the time in Ligue 2 (the French 2nd division). ===International=== Internationally, Krol made his debut for the Netherlands in 1969 against England, retiring from international football in 1983. He was a crucial component in the Total Football side of the 1970s. A versatile defender, he could play in any position along the back four or midfield. In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, in which the Netherlands reached the final, Krol primarily played at left-back. He created Cruijff's goal against Brazil and scored a 25-yard screamer against Argentina. By the time the 1978 FIFA World Cup came about, Krol had switched to playing as a sweeper and had earned the captain's armband after the retirement of Cruijff. Krol played for the Netherlands as captain at the 1980 European Championship. He played for part of the qualifying for Euro 84, and played his last international in 1983. ==Managerial career== In his managerial career, he has been head coach of Egypt, and has been assistant manager of the Netherlands (under Frank Rijkaard and Louis van Gaal) and Ajax (under Ronald Koeman). He became interim manager of Ajax after the resignation of Koeman. He was manager of AC Ajaccio in France Ligue 2 from 2006 to 2007. He returned as manager of Egyptian giants Zamalek in August 2007. He had previously managed them from 1994 to 1999, winning the Egyptian Cup in 1999, the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1996 and the Afro-Asian Club Championship 1997, the last two being the biggest club level prizes available to CAF clubs. Krol's return to Zamalek was meant to be a stabilizing presence, the club having gone through several managers in the preceding two seasons. His stay however would be a short one. He ended his sole season by winning one Egyptian Cup with Zamalek, within one season he would leave and sign a three-year contract with the South African giants Orlando Pirates. In the three years with the Orlando Pirates he won two South African cups (and a finalist once) and won the national league, all in his last year in charge of the team. Those cups include MTN8 and Nedbank Cup. Despite that success his contract was not renewed. He won the Tunisian championship with CS Sfaxien in 2012‚Äì2013, after a fierce battle with the other 3 of the Tunisian big 4. After that success, he was contacted to lead the Tunisian national team in the play off qualifying to the 2014 world cup against Cameroon. He accepted that role and simultaneously became manager of CS Sfaxien and Tunisia in September 2013. He won the 2013 CAF Confederation Cup with Sfaxien. He resigned from his duties as Sfaxien coach after the second leg of the final against TP Mazembe on 30 November 2013.

It is close to Ringwood railway station, located opposite the centre on Maroondah Highway. The centre features two main levels of shops, with a third level containing a Hoyts 12-screen cinema complex and restaurants, forming a total of approximately 235 stores. It is the largest shopping centre in the City of Maroondah, and is located in relatively close proximity to Westfield Doncaster and Westfield Knox ==History== Construction commenced on the two level enclosed complex in July 1966, with a Myer and a Safeway supermarket and variety store as major anchors, along with 40 speciality stores and a 1200 space car park. The initial centre cost $13,000,000 (1966) ($167,568,115.94 (2017)) to construct, on a parcel of land just north of the Maroondah Highway in the heart of Ringwood. In 1993 a massive redevelopment of the centre was announced, which involved the demolition of the existing centre in its entirety except for the 4 storey Myer building (which was simply refurbished), and after a series of three staged openings culminated in the relaunch of a new look Eastland in May, 1995. This extension brought the Centre to with major retailers Myer, Safeway and Kmart and 170 specialty retailers. In 1996 the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) purchased the centre from Coles Myer. ===Stage 4 Expansion=== In early 2001, after years of rumors and consumer desire for cinemas in Ringwood, QIC announced plans for a stage 4 expansion. Key to this expansion was a Hoyts 12 screen cinema complex (down from the originally planned 14), a few restaurants (including a Pancake Parlour), a Big-W store, and a 2nd major supermarket, which at the time was scheduled to be a Bilo Mega Fresh store (but only a regular Bilo store was built), and an additional 50 specialty stores, increasing the centre's retail size by approximately . Big-W and Bilo opened in late October 2002, along with a handful of the 50 specialty stores. The cinemas opened on 26 December 2002. ===Eastland Expansion 2015-2016 (Stage 5)=== Expansion rumors persisted for years, with initial plans including a large 3-level expansion, connecting the Hoyts end with Maroondah Highway, providing a new entrance to the 3rd level of Myer, and culminating in an outdoor alfresco dining and nightlife area, similar to Knox Ozone. Also included in the plans were an open town centre area and a new public library and office and hotel towers. This development was originally due to get underway in late 2009, but stalled due to the Global Financial Crisis until 2013. Enabling works commenced in 2012 allowing for changes to be made to the Eastern Multilevel carpark; the entry ramp to the 3rd level of the carpark was moved, and Kmart Tyre & Auto Service was relocated to the North-Western carpark off Ringwood Street. This work was considered necessary before any redevelopment could commence. QIC publicly unveiled the $665 million Stage 5 redevelopment on 28 October 2013. The centre has been expanded by approximately 50% in retail space, from approximately , making it one of the largest shopping centres in Australia, and almost identical in size to nearby Westfield Doncaster. The new expansion includes a new Target discount department store and a David Jones department store. The new David Jones store will be the latest of the retailer's \\"Next Generation Store\\" concepts - featuring increased space for fashion and cosmetics, with less space for homewares and no space for electronics. The expansion spans two levels for the most part, creating new south and east malls, with an outdoor alfresco dining and entertainment area surrounding the new Ringwood Town Centre and public library space on the third/ground level. The expansion has a focus (after customer feedback on the existing mix) on creating more dining and entertainment options for the people of Ringwood, as well as introducing more high-end fashion options into the centre. QIC appointed Seventh Wave as Creative Directors for Stage 5 to oversee the expansion. The Realm Library, Town Square, David Jones and the Shard were designed by ACME, the Central Mall refurbishment and link malls were designed by Universal Design Studios and the East Mall was designed by Softroom. The redevelopment completed in two stages, the first stage opened on 29 October 2015 and the second stage opened on 5 May 2016. QIC also owns the adjacent Ringwood Market site - which was demolished at the end of 2009 to make way for a new retail/commercial development - and past plans for a westward expansion of three separate five-storey buildings, including office space, underground parking, and boutique shops/dining along with the space for a retail store (Costco, IKEA and Masters Home Improvement were all rumoured to be vying for the space), linked to Eastland were suggested. Since, then, Melbourne's second Costco Australia store was rumoured and then confirmed, with construction commencing in August, 2012. The 14,500sqm store was opened on 20 November 2013.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/crowd-queues-for-hours-as- costcos-ringwood-store-opens/story-fngnvlxu-1226764225719 ==References== ==External links== * *QIC *Project Site ACME *video animation *Project description (Eastland) Category:Shopping centres in Melbourne Category:Shopping malls established in 1967 Category:Prix Versailles-winning shopping malls ","title":"Eastland Shopping Centre"},{"id":"1298355","text":"Bouzoukia may refer to: * Bouzouki (pl. bouzoukia), a Greek lute * Bouzoukia (nightclub), Greek nightclubs that feature la√Øk√≥ music ","title":"Bouzoukia"},{"id":"1298362","text":"is a Japanese voice actress, singer and narrator who works for Aoni Production.http://aoni.co.jp/search/asano-masumi.html ==Biography== Asano was born on August 25, 1977 in Noshiro, Akita and studied at the Kokugakuin University Faculty of Literature.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Purshottamar and his consort Lakshmi as Poornavalli. Purushottamar is believed to have appeared to Hindu gods Brahma and Shiva, to relieve Shiva off his sins committed while cutting one of Brahma's heads. The temple is one of the few historical temples in India where the images of Hindu trimurti, Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma are housed in the same premises. It is one of the two temples in Chola Nadu where the trinity can be seen in the same premises, the other being Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple at Thirukkandiyur. The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, while the temple tank is located outside the main gateway. Six daily rituals and four yearly festivals are held at the temple for each of trinities. The major festival of the temple, the Brahmotsavam, is celebrated during the Tamil month of Kartigai (November ‚Äì December) when festival images of both Purushotamar and Bikshadanar are carried together in the streets surrounding the temple. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. ==Etymology and legend== Uthyanga Vimanam, the roof of the sanctum As per Hindu legend, the god Vishnu emerged as a Kadamba tree here, giving the name Kathambanur, which later became Karambanur. The name Karambanur is mentioned by Thirumangai Azhwar in Nalayira Divya Prabandam, in which he refers to the presiding deity as \\"Karambanur Uthaman\\". The temple is commonly called \\"Uthamar Kovil\\" derived from the presiding deity. The temple is also called Bhikshandar Kovil as the god Shiva is present in the form of Bhikshandar (a mendicant) and believed to have attained cure by worshiping Vishnu at this place. As per Hindu legend, once Vishnu wanted to test the devotion of the god Brahma. He raised as a Kadamba tree in the place; Brahma worshipped him with thirumanjanam (ablution). The water from the ablution filled a tank nearby, which came to be known as \\"Kathamba Theertham\\". Vishnu was satisfied with the devotion of Brahma and gave a boon to Brahma to have a shrine in this place. Shiva wanted to expiate the sin for decapitating a head of Brahma and went on a pilgrimage. Here, Vishnu requested his consort Lakshmi to give alms to Shiva. Shiva's grail was filled by the alms and Lakshmi came to be known as Poornavalli Thayar (the one who filled the grail). As per another legend, Brahma and Shiva both had originally five heads. Parvati, the wife of Shiva, once got confused and worshipped Brahma, instead of her husband. Shiva got enraged and cut off one of Brahma's heads; the head stuck in Shiva's hand due to Brahma's curse. To atone for the sin, Shiva worshipped Vishnu here; Shiva was fully relieved of the curse after worshipping Vishnu at Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple. ==The temple== 200px As per Hindu legend, the temple is believed to have been constructed by Janaka, the king of Janakapuri and the father of the goddess Sita. Thirumangai Azhwar is believed to have resided in the temple to build the surrounding walls of the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. During the war between British and French in 1751, the temple acted as an infantry for both the troops. There was no damage done to the temple during the war. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temples has images and separate shrines for Purushottamar (Vishnu), Bhikshadanar (Shiva), Brahma and their respective consorts Poornavalli (Lakshmi), Soundaraya Parvati and Saraswati. This is one of the few historical Hindu temples in the world, where the Hindu Trimurti are worshipped along with their consorts in six separate shrines within the same temple complex. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Vishnu, as Purushottamar, in reclining posture with the discus in one hand. The roof or vimana of the central shrine is called Udhyoga Vimana. There are two shrines located to the south east, each housing the image of Poornavalli and Mahalakshmi. The Shiva shrine, located behind Vishnu's, houses the lingam (aniconic form of Shiva) as Bhikshadanar. The granite images of the deities Ganesha (son of Shiva and god of wisdom), Murugan (son of Shiva and god of war), Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva) and Navagraha (nine planetary deities) are located in the hall leading to the Shiva sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct of the Shiva shrine has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The shrines of Brahma and his consort Saraswati are located in the south west corner of the temple complex. The Sapthaguru or seven gurus (teachers) are identified in the temple. The seven are Bhikshadanar (representing Sadasiva Guru, Shiva as a guru), Brahma (Brahma Guru), Soundarya Parvati (Shakti Guru, the Goddess as a guru), Brihaspati (Deva Guru, the teacher of the gods), Varadarajaperumal (Vishnu Guru), Murugan (Gnana Guru, the guru of knowledge) and Shukra (Asura Guru, the guru of demons). ==Festival and administration== An aerial view of the temple The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The priests of the Bhikshadanar shrine belong to the Shaiva community, while the priests of Purushothamar are from Vaishnava community. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. The Shaiva and Vaishnava sects have their own rituals. The ritual of Bhikshadanar comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Bhikshadanar and Soundarya Parvati. The worship is held amidst religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi for Bhikshadanar. The major festival of the temple, the Brahmotsavam, is celebrated during the Tamil month of Kartigai (November ‚Äì December) when festival images of both Purushothamar and Bhikshadanar are carried together in the streets surrounding the temple. Kadambha Thiruvizha is a festival celebrated in the temple when the festival image of Ranganatha (a form of Vishnu) is brought to the Kadambha tank of the temple for Theerthavari. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. ==Religious significance== Sculpture of Vinayaga on the wall of the temple Uthamar Kovil is one of the two temples in Chola Nadu where the trinity can be seen in the same premises, the other being Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple at Thirukkandiyur. Trimurti in Hindu mythology refers to the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction. They are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in ten hymns. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Thirumangai Alvar have sung in praise of the perumal in this temple with one Pasuram (hymn). Periyavachan Pillai, who translated the verses of Thirumangai Azhwar, glorifies the temple as \\"the one without doors where devotees can always visit and worship\\". ==References== ==External links== Category:Hindu temples in Tiruchirappalli district Category:Brahma temples ","title":"Uthamar Kovil"},{"id":"1298400","text":"Reference.com is an online encyclopedia that organizes content that uses a question-and-answer format.

The following year, it became a four-year college, also offering instruction in pharmacology. The college continued to expand steadily in the following years, establishing its graduate school in 1972 and gaining university status in 1980. ==International relations== Catholic University of Daegu maintains international relations with 68 universities in 19 countries: The ASEAN International Mobility for Students (AIMS) programme member * SEAMEO RIHED === IFCU member=== *International Federation of Catholic Universities === ASEACCU member=== *The Association of South East Asian Catholic Colleges and Universities === Australia === *Australian Catholic University === Canada === *The University of Alberta ===China=== *China National Academy of Fine Art *China Sichuan Normal University *ChongQing University of Arts and Sciences *Guangdong University of Foreign Studies *Guizhou Normal University *Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine *Jilin University *Luoyang Normal University *Nanjing Normal University *Shandong Economic University *Shandong University *The Central University of Nationalities *Jiangxi Normal University *Yanbian University *Zibo Vocational Institute === France === *Universit√© Catholique de Lille === Germany === *Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg === Hungary === *Ferenc Liszt Academy of Music === Indonesia === *Universitas Nasional *Atma Jaya Yogyakarta University *Atma Jaya Indonesia Catholic University, Jakarta *State University of Malang *Indonesia International Institute for Life Science === Italy === *Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera *Conservatorio di Musica S.

Access to traditional lands and forests are some of the most important issues for Adivasi communities today. Adivasi is the collective term for tribes of the Indian subcontinent, who are considered indigenous to places within India wherein they live, either as foragers or as tribalistic sedentary communities. The term is also used for ethnic minorities, such as Chakmas of Bangladesh, Tharus of Nepal, and Vedda of Sri Lanka. They comprise a substantial minority population of India, making up 8.6% of India's population, or 104.2 million people, according to the 2011 census. Adivasi societies are particularly prominent in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, and Northeast India, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Though considered to be the original inhabitants of India, many present-day Adivasi communities formed after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation, harboring various degrees of ancestry from ancient hunter-gatherers, Iranian farmers, Indo-Aryan, and Austroasiatic and Tibeto- Burman language speakers. Tribal languages can be categorised into six linguistic groupings, namely Andamanese; Austro-Asiatic; Dravidian; Indo- Aryan; Sino-Tibetan; and Kra-Dai. Adivasi studies is a new scholarly field, drawing upon archaeology, anthropology, agrarian history, environmental history, subaltern studies, indigenous studies, aboriginal studies, and developmental economics. It adds debates that are specific to the Indian context.Sangeeta Dasgupta, \\"Adivasi studies: From a historian's perspective.\\" History Compass 16.10 (2018): e12486 https://doi.org/10.1111/hic3.12486 ==Definition and etymology== Woman of Banni tribe in traditional attire from Gujarat Adivasi is the collective term for the Tribes of India,Encyclopedia Britannica, Adivasi who are considered to be the indigenous people of India. prior to the Dravidians and Indo-Aryans. It refers to \\"any of various ethnic groups considered to be the original inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent.\\" However India doesn't recognise tribes as indigenous people. India ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 107 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the United Nations (1957). In 1989, India refused to sign the ILO Convention 169. It is a modern Sanskrit word specifically coined for that purpose in the 1930s by political activists, and recognised by the Supreme Court of India.S. Faizi & Priya K. Nair, 2016. \\"Adivasis: The World‚Äôs Largest Population of Indigenous People,\\" Development, Palgrave Macmillan;Society for International Deveopment, vol. 59(3), pages 350-353, December. In Hindi, Adivasi means \\"Original Inhabitants,\\" from ƒÅdi 'beginning, origin'; and vƒÅsin 'dweller' (itself from vas 'to dwell'), thus literally meaning 'original inhabitant'.\\"Adivasi, n. and adj.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 10 September 2017. Although terms such as atavika, vanavƒÅsi (\\"forest dwellers\\"), or girijan (\\"mountain people\\")Elst, Koenraad: (2001) are also used for the tribes of India, adivƒÅsi carries the specific meaning of being the original and autochthonous inhabitants of a given region, and the self-designation of those tribal groups. The constitution of India grouped these ethnic groups together \\"as targets for social and economic development. Since that time the Adivasi of India have been known officially as Scheduled Tribes.\\" Article 366 (25) defined scheduled tribes as \\"such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution\\". The term Adivasi is also used for the ethnic minorities of Bangladesh, the Vedda people of Sri Lanka and the native Tharu people of Nepal. Another Nepalese term is Adivasi Janjati (; ), although the political context differed historically under the Shah and Rana dynasties. In India, opposition to the usage of the term is varied. Critics argue that the \\"original inhabitant\\" contention is based on the fact that they have no land and are therefore asking for land reform. The Adivasis argue that they have been oppressed by the \\"superior group\\" and that they require and demand a reward, more specifically land reform. Adivasi issues are not related to land reforms but to the historical rights to the forests that were alienated during the colonial period. In 2006, India finally made a law to \\"undo the historical injustice\\" committed to the Adivasis.The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 In Assam, the term adivƒÅsi applies only to the Tea-tribes imported from Central India during colonial times. ==Demographics== Scheduled Tribes distribution map in India by state and union territory according to 2011 Census. Mizoram and Lakshadweep had the highest % of its population as ST (‚âà95%), while Punjab and Haryana had 0%. A substantial list of Scheduled Tribes in India are recognised as tribal under the Constitution of India. Tribal people constitute 8.6% of the nation's total population, over 104 million people according to the 2011 census. One concentration lies in a belt along the northwest Himalayas: consisting of Jammu and Kashmir, where are found many semi-nomadic groups, to Ladakh and northern Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where are found Tibeto-Burman groups. In the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, more than 90% of the population is tribal. However, in the remaining northeast states of Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, and Tripura, tribal peoples form between 20 and 30% of the population. The largest population of tribals lives in a belt stretching from eastern Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west all the way to western West Bengal, a region known as the tribal belt. These tribes correspond roughly to three regions. The western region, in eastern Gujarat, southeastern Rajasthan, northwestern Maharashtra as well as western Madhya Pradesh, is dominated by Indo-Aryan speaking tribes like the Bhils. The central region, covering eastern Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, western and southern Chhattisgarh, northern and eastern Telangana, northern Andhra Pradesh and western Odisha is dominated by Dravidian tribes like the Gonds and Khonds. The eastern belt, centred on the Chhota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand and adjacent areas of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal, is dominated by Munda tribes like the Hos and Santals. Roughly 75% of the total tribal population live in this belt, although the tribal population there accounts for only around 10% of the region's total population. Further south, the region near Bellary in Karnataka has a large concentration of tribals, mostly Boyas/Valmikis. Small pockets can be found throughout the rest of South India. By far the largest of these pockets is in found in the region containing the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu, Wayanad district of Kerala and nearby hill ranges of Chamarajanagar and Mysore districts of southern Karnataka. Further south, only small pockets of tribal settlement remain in the Western and Eastern Ghats. The scheduled tribe population in Jharkhand constitutes 26.2% of the state. Tribals in Jharkhand mainly follow Sarnaism, an animistic religion. Chhattisgarh has also over 80 lakh scheduled tribe population. Assam has over 60 lakh Adivasis primarily as tea workers. Adivasis in India mainly follow Animism, Hinduism and Christianity. ==History== ===Origins=== Though considered to be the original inhabitants of India, present-day Adivasi formed after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation, harboring various degrees of ancestry from ancient hunter-gatherers, IVC-people (itself a mixture of ancient hunter-gatherers and people related to, but not descended from, Iranian farmers), Ancestral North Indians (a mixture of IVC-people and Indo-Aryan migrants, formed after the decline of the IVC), and Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman language speakers. Only the Andamanese people seem to be directly related to the oldest inhabitants of India. ===Ancient India (c.1500 BCE-500 CE)=== Although considered uncivilised and primitive, Adivasis were usually not held to be intrinsically impure by surrounding (usually Dravidian or Aryan) caste Hindu populations, unlike Dalits, who were. Thus, the Adivasi origins of Valmiki, who composed the Ramayana, were acknowledged, as were the origins of Adivasi tribes such as the Garasia and Bhilala, which descended from mixed Rajput and Bhil marriages. Unlike the subjugation of the Dalits, the Adivasis often enjoyed autonomy and, depending on region, evolved mixed hunter-gatherer and farming economies, controlling their lands as a joint patrimony of the tribe. In some areas, securing Adivasi approval and support was considered crucial by local rulers, and larger Adivasi groups were able to sustain their own kingdoms in central India. The Meenas and Gond Rajas of Garha-Mandla and Chanda are examples of an Adivasi aristocracy that ruled in this region, and were \\"not only the hereditary leaders of their Gond subjects, but also held sway over substantial communities of non-tribals who recognized them as their feudal lords.\\" ===Medieval India (c.500-1700 CE)=== The historiography of relationships between the Adivasis and the rest of Indian society is patchy. There are references to alliances between Ahom Kings of Brahmaputra valley and the hill Nagas. This relative autonomy and collective ownership of Adivasi land by Adivasis was severely disrupted by the advent of the Mughals in the early 16th century. Rebellions against Mughal authority include the Bhil Rebellion of 1632 and the Bhil-Gond Insurrection of 1643P. 27 Madhya Pradesh: Shajapur By Madhya Pradesh (India) which were both pacified by Mughal soldiers. With the advent of the Kachwaha Rajputs and Mughals into their territory, the Meenas were gradually sidelined and pushed deep into the forests. As a result, historical literature has completely bypassed the Meena tribe. The combined army of Mughals and Bharmal attacked the tribal king Bada Meena and killed him damaging 52 kots and 56 gates. Bada's treasure was shared between Mughals and Bharmal. ===British period (c.1700-1947)=== From the very early days of British rule, the tribesmen resented the British encroachments upon their tribal system. They were found resisting or supporting their brethren of Tamar and Jhalda in rebellion. Nor did their raja welcome the British administrative innovations.P. 219 Calcutta Review By University of Calcutta, 1964 Beginning in the 18th century, the British added to the consolidation of feudalism in India, first under the Jagirdari system and then under the zamindari system. Beginning with the Permanent Settlement imposed by the British in Bengal and Bihar, which later became the template for a deepening of feudalism throughout India, the older social and economic system in the country began to alter radically. Land, both forest areas belonging to adivasis and settled farmland belonging to non-adivasi peasants, was rapidly made the legal property of British-designated zamindars (landlords), who in turn moved to extract the maximum economic benefit possible from their newfound property and subjects. Adivasi lands sometimes experienced an influx of non-local settlers, often brought from far away (as in the case of Muslims and Sikhs brought to Kol territory) by the zamindars to better exploit local land, forest and labour. Deprived of the forests and resources they traditionally depended on and sometimes coerced to pay taxes, many adivasis were forced to borrow at usurious rates from moneylenders, often the zamindars themselves. When they were unable to pay, that forced them to become bonded labourers for the zamindars. Often, far from paying off the principal of their debt, they were unable even to offset the compounding interest, and this was made the justification for their children working for the zamindar after the death of the initial borrower. In the case of the Andamanese adivasis, long isolated from the outside world in autonomous societies, mere contact with outsiders was often sufficient to set off deadly epidemics in tribal populations, and it is alleged that some sections of the British government directly attempted to destroy some tribes. Land dispossession and subjugation by British and zamindar interests resulted in a number of Adivasi revolts in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as the Santal hul (or Santhal rebellion) of 1855‚Äì56. Although these were suppressed ruthlessly by the governing British authority (the East India Company prior to 1858, and the British government after 1858), partial restoration of privileges to adivasi elites (e.g. to Mankis, the leaders of Munda tribes) and some leniency in tax burdens resulted in relative calm, despite continuing and widespread dispossession, from the late nineteenth century onwards. The economic deprivation, in some cases, triggered internal adivasi migrations within India that would continue for another century, including as labour for the emerging tea plantations in Assam. ====Participation in Indian independence movement==== There were tribal reform and rebellion movements during the period of the British Empire, some of which also participated in the Indian independence movement or attacked mission posts.HEUZE, G√©rard: O√π Va l‚ÄôInde Moderne? L‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris 1993. A. Tirkey: \\"Evangelization among the Uraons\\", Indian Missiological Review, June 1997, esp. p. 30-32. Elst 2001 There were several Adivasis in the Indian independence movement including Dharindhar Bhyuan, Laxman Naik, Jantya Bhil, Bangaru Devi and Rehma Vasave. During the period of British rule, India saw the rebellions of several then backward castes, mainly tribal peoples that revolted against British rule. ==Tribal languages== Tribal languages can be categorised into five linguistic groupings, namely Andamanse; Austro-Asiatic; Dravidian; Indo-Aryan; and Sino- Tibetan. * Banjari language * Bhil language * Bodo language * Bonda language * Chaudhari language * Chenchu language * Dhodia language * Gamit language * Gondi language * Halbi language * Ho language * Irula language * Karbi language * Khasi language * Kora language * Kui language * Kuki language * Kurukh language * Mizo language * Mundari language * Paniya language * Santali language * Tharu language * Varli language * Vasavi language ==Religion== In the census of India from 1871 to 1941, tribals have been counted in different religions from other religions, 1891 (forest tribe), 1901 (animist), 1911 (tribal animist), 1921 (hill and forest tribe), 1931 (primitive tribe), 1941 (tribes), However, since the census of 1951, the tribal population has been stopped separately. Now the majority of Adivasi practice Hinduism and Christianity. During the last two decades Adivasi from Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand have converted to Protestant groups. Adivasi beliefs vary by tribe, and are usually different from the historical Vedic religion, with its monistic underpinnings, Indo-European deities (who are often cognates of ancient Iranian, Greek and Roman deities, e.g. Mitra/Mithra/Mithras), lack of idol worship and lack of a concept of reincarnation. ===Animism=== Animism (from Latin animus, -i \\"soul, life\\") is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena) possess a spiritual essence. The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Society estimates that 1‚Äì5% of India's population is animist. India's government recognises that India's indigenous subscribe to pre-Hindu animist-based religions. Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of some indigenous tribal peoples, especially prior to the development of organised religion. Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, \\"animism\\" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' \\"spiritual\\" or \\"supernatural\\" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so fundamental, mundane, everyday and taken-for-granted that most animistic indigenous people do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to \\"animism\\" (or even \\"religion\\"); the term is an anthropological construct rather than one designated by the people themselves. ====Donyi-Polo==== Donyi-Polo is the designation given to the indigenous religions, of animistic and shamanic type, of the Tani, from Arunachal Pradesh, in northeastern India.Rikam, 2005. p. 117Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 47 The name \\"Donyi-Polo\\" means \\"Sun-Moon\\".Dalmia, Sadana, 2012. pp. 44‚Äì45 ====Sanamahi==== Sanamahism is the worship of Sanamahi, the eternal force/cells responsible for the continuity of living creations. Sanamahi referred here is not to be confused with Lainingthou Sanamahi (The Supreme House-dwelling God of the Sanamahism). The religion has a great and unique traditional history which has been preserved till date for worshipping ancestors as almighty. Thus it signifies that Sanamahism is the worship of eternal force/cells present in living creations. Sidaba Mapu, the Creator God of Sanamahism. Sanamahism is one of the oldest religion of South East Asia. It originated in Manipur and is mainly practiced by the Meitei, Kabui, Zeliangrong and other communities who inhabit in Manipur, Assam, Tripura. ====Sarnaism==== Sarnaism or SarnaMinahan, 2012. p. 236Sachchidananda, 1980. p. 235Srivastava, 2007. (local languages: Sarna Dhorom, meaning \\"religion of the holy woods\\") defines the indigenous religions of the Adivasi populations of the states of Central-East India, such as the Munda, the Ho, the Santali, the Khuruk, and the others. The Munda, Ho, Santhal and Oraon tribe followed the Sarna religion, where Sarna means sacred grove. Their religion is based on the oral traditions passed from generation-to-generation. ====Other tribal animist==== Animist hunter gatherer Nayaka people of Nigrill's hills of South India. Animism is the traditional religion of Nicobarese people; their religion is marked by the dominance and interplay with spirit worship, witch doctors and animal sacrifice. ===Hinduism=== ====Adivasi roots of modern Hinduism==== Some historians and anthropologists assert that much of what constitutes folk Hinduism today is actually descended from an amalgamation of adivasi faiths, idol worship practices and deities, rather than the original Indo-Aryan faith. This also includes the sacred status of certain animals such as monkeys, cows, fish, matsya, peacocks, cobras (nagas) and elephants and plants such as the sacred fig (pipal), Ocimum tenuiflorum (tulsi) and Azadirachta indica (neem), which may once have held totemic importance for certain adivasi tribes. ====Adivasi saints==== A sant is an Indian holy man, and a title of a devotee or ascetic, especially in north and east India. Generally, a holy or saintly person is referred to as a mahatma, paramahamsa, or swami, or given the prefix Sri or Srila before their name. The term is sometimes misrepresented in English as \\"Hindu saint\\", although \\"sant\\" is unrelated to \\"saint\\". * Sant Buddhu Bhagat, led the Kol Insurrection (1831‚Äì1832) aimed against tax imposed on Mundas by Muslim rulers. * Sant Dhira or Kannappa Nayanar, one of 63 Nayanar Shaivite sants, a hunter from whom Lord Shiva gladly accepted food offerings.

In fact, Chandalas are often addressed as 'Matanga 'in passages like Varaha Purana 1.139.91 ====Avatars==== * Birsa Bhagwan or Birsa Munda, considered an avatar of Khasra Kora. People approached him as Singbonga, the Sun god. His sect included Christian converts. He and his clan, the Mundas, were connected with Vaishnavite traditions as they were influenced by Sri Chaitanya. Birsa was very close to the Panre brothers Vaishnavites. * Kirata ‚Äì the form of Lord Shiva as a hunter. It is mentioned in the Mahabharata. The Karppillikkavu Sree Mahadeva Temple, Kerala adores Lord Shiva in this avatar and is known to be one of the oldest surviving temples in Bharat. * Vettakkorumakan, the son of Lord Kirata. * Kaladutaka or 'Vaikunthanatha', Kallar (robber), avatar of Lord Vishnu. ====Other tribals and Hinduism==== Some Hindus believe that Indian tribals are close to the romantic ideal of the ancient silvan cultureThomas Parkhill: The Forest Setting in Hindu Epics. of the Vedic people. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar said: At the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, there are Brahmin and Badu (tribal) priests.

The All India Adivasi Conference was held on 1 and 2 January 2011 at Burnpur, Asansol, West Bengal. 750 delegates were present from all parts of India and cast their votes for Religion code as follows: Sari Dhorom ‚Äì 632, Sarna ‚Äì 51, Kherwalism ‚Äì 14 and Other Religions ‚Äì 03. Census of India.http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20100224/812/tnl-tribals- appeal-for-separate-religion.html ==Education== Tribal communities in India are the least educationally developed. First generation learners have to face social, psychological and cultural barriers to get education. This has been one of the reason for poor performance of tribal students in schools. Poor literacy rate since independence has resulted in absence of tribals in academia and higher education. The literacy rate for STs has gone up from 8.5% (male ‚Äì 13.8%, female ‚Äì 3.2%) in 1961 to 29.6% (male ‚Äì 40.6%, female ‚Äì 18.2%) in 1991 and to 40% (male ‚Äì 59%, female ‚Äì 37%) in 1999‚Äì2000. States with large proportion of STs like Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya have high literacy rate while States with large number of tribals like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have low tribal literacy rate. Tribal students have very high drop-out rates during school education. Extending the system of primary education into tribal areas and reserving places for needing them, they say, to work in the fields. On the other hand, in those parts of the northeast where tribes have generally been spared the wholesale onslaught of outsiders, schooling has helped tribal people to secure political and economic benefits. The education system there has provided a corps of highly trained tribal members in the professions and high-ranking administrative posts. tribal children in middle and high schools and higher education institutions are central to government policy, but efforts to improve a tribe's educational status have had mixed results. Recruitment of qualified teachers and determination of the appropriate language of instruction also remain troublesome. Commission after commission on the \\"language question\\" has called for instruction, at least at the primary level, in the students' native language. In some regions, tribal children entering school must begin by learning the official regional language, often one completely unrelated to their tribal language. Many tribal schools are plagued by high drop-out rates. Children attend for the first three to four years of primary school and gain a smattering of knowledge, only to lapse into illiteracy later. Few who enter continue up to the tenth grade; of those who do, few manage to finish high school. Therefore, very few are eligible to attend institutions of higher education, where the high rate of attrition continues. Members of agrarian tribes like the Gonds often are reluctant to send their children to school, An academy for teaching and preserving Adivasi languages and culture was established in 1999 by the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre. The Adivasi Academy is located at Tejgadh in Gujarat. ==Economy== Most tribes are concentrated in heavily forested areas that combine inaccessibility with limited political or economic significance. Historically, the economy of most tribes was subsistence agriculture or hunting and gathering. Tribal members traded with outsiders for the few necessities they lacked, such as salt and iron. A few local Hindu craftsmen might provide such items as cooking utensils. In the early 20th century, however, large areas fell into the hands of non-tribals, on account of improved transportation and communications. Around 1900, many regions were opened by the British government to settlement through a scheme by which inward migrants received ownership of land free in return for cultivating it. For tribal people, however, land was often viewed as a common resource, free to whoever needed it. By the time tribals accepted the necessity of obtaining formal land titles, they had lost the opportunity to lay claim to lands that might rightfully have been considered theirs. The colonial and post-independence regimes belatedly realised the necessity of protecting tribals from the predations of outsiders and prohibited the sale of tribal lands. Although an important loophole in the form of land leases was left open, tribes made some gains in the mid-twentieth century, and some land was returned to tribal peoples despite obstruction by local police and land officials. In the 1970s, tribal peoples came again under intense land pressure, especially in central India. Migration into tribal lands increased dramatically, as tribal people lost the titles to their lands in many ways ‚Äì lease, forfeiture from debts, or bribery of land registry officials. Other non-tribals simply squatted or even lobbied governments to classify them as tribal to allow them to compete with the formerly established tribes. In any case, many tribal members became landless labourers in the 1960s and 1970s, and regions that a few years earlier had been the exclusive domain of tribes had an increasingly mixed population of tribals and non-tribals. Government efforts to evict nontribal members from illegal occupation have proceeded slowly; when evictions occur at all, those ejected are usually members of poor, lower castes. Improved communications, roads with motorised traffic, and more frequent government intervention figured in the increased contact that tribal peoples had with outsiders. Commercial highways and cash crops frequently drew non-tribal people into remote areas. By the 1960s and 1970s, the resident nontribal shopkeeper was a permanent feature of many tribal villages. Since shopkeepers often sell goods on credit (demanding high interest), many tribal members have been drawn deeply into debt or mortgaged their land. Merchants also encourage tribals to grow cash crops (such as cotton or castor-oil plants), which increases tribal dependence on the market for necessities. Indebtedness is so extensive that although such transactions are illegal, traders sometimes 'sell' their debtors to other merchants, much like indentured peons. The final blow for some tribes has come when non- tribals, through political jockeying, have managed to gain legal tribal status, that is, to be listed as a Scheduled Tribe. Tribes in the Himalayan foothills have not been as hard-pressed by the intrusions of non-tribal. Historically, their political status was always distinct from the rest of India. Until the British colonial period, there was little effective control by any of the empires centred in peninsular India; the region was populated by autonomous feuding tribes. The British, in efforts to protect the sensitive northeast frontier, followed a policy dubbed the \\"Inner Line\\"; non-tribal people were allowed into the areas only with special permission. Postindependence governments have continued the policy, protecting the Himalayan tribes as part of the strategy to secure the border with China. ===Ecological threats=== Many smaller tribal groups are quite sensitive to ecological degradation caused by modernisation. Both commercial forestry and intensive agriculture have proved destructive to the forests that had endured swidden agriculture for many centuries.Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur- India. . pp 440 Adivasis in central part of India have been victims of the Salwa Judum campaign by the Government against the Naxalite insurgency.Salwa Judum Government policies on forest reserves have affected tribal peoples profoundly. Government efforts to reserve forests have precipitated armed (if futile) resistance on the part of the tribal peoples involved. Intensive exploitation of forests has often meant allowing outsiders to cut large areas of trees (while the original tribal inhabitants were restricted from cutting), and ultimately replacing mixed forests capable of sustaining tribal life with single-product plantations. Non-tribals have frequently bribed local officials to secure the effective use of reserved forest lands. The northern tribes have thus been sheltered from the kind of exploitation that those elsewhere in South Asia have suffered. In Arunachal Pradesh (formerly part of the North- East Frontier Agency), for example, tribal members control commerce and most lower-level administrative posts. Government construction projects in the region have provided tribes with a significant source of cash. Some tribes have made rapid progress through the education system (the role of early missionaries was significant in this regard). Instruction was begun in Assamese but was eventually changed to Hindi; by the early 1980s, English was taught at most levels. Northeastern tribal people have thus enjoyed a certain measure of social mobility. The continuing economic alienation and exploitation of many adivasis was highlighted as a \\"systematic failure\\" by the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh in a 2009 conference of chief ministers of all 29 Indian states, where he also cited this as a major cause of the Naxalite unrest that has affected areas such as the Red Corridor. ==Tribal classification criteria and demands== Scarification, a traditional symbol of Great Andamanese tribal identity (1901 photo) The criteria presently followed for specification of a community as a Scheduled Tribe are : (i) indications of primitive traits, (ii) distinctive culture, (iii) geographical isolation, (iv) shyness of contact with the community at large, and (v) backwardness. Population complexities, and the controversies surrounding ethnicity and language in India, sometimes make the official recognition of groups as Adivasis (by way of inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list) political and contentious. However, regardless of their language family affiliations, Australoid and Negrito groups that have survived as distinct forest, mountain or island-dwelling tribes in India and are often classified as Adivasi. The relatively autonomous Mongoloid tribal groups of Northeastern India (including Khasis, Apatani and Nagas), who are mostly Austro-Asiatic or Tibeto-Burman speakers, are also considered to be Adivasis: this area comprises 7.5% of India's land area but 20% of its Adivasi population. However, not all autonomous northeastern groups are considered Adivasis; for instance, the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Meitei of Manipur were once tribal but, having been settled for many centuries, are caste Hindus. It is also difficult, for a given social grouping, to definitively decide whether it is a \\"caste\\" or a \\"tribe\\". A combination of internal social organisation, relationship with other groups, self-classification and perception by other groups has to be taken into account to make a categorisation, which is at best inexact and open to doubt. These categorisations have been diffused for thousands of years, and even ancient formulators of caste-discriminatory legal codes (which usually only applied to settled populations, and not Adivasis) were unable to come up with clean distinctions. ===Demands for tribal classification=== The additional difficulty in deciding whether a group meets the criteria to be Adivasi or not are the aspirational movements created by the federal and state benefits, including job and educational reservations, enjoyed by groups listed as scheduled tribes (STs). In Manipur, Meitei commentators have pointed to the lack of scheduled tribe status as a key economic disadvantage for Meiteis competing for jobs against groups that are classified as scheduled tribes. In Assam, Rajbongshi representatives have demanded scheduled tribe status as well. In Rajasthan, the Gujjar community has demanded ST status, even blockading the national capital of Delhi to press their demand. However, the Government of Rajasthan declined the Gujjars' demand, stating the Gujjars are treated as upper caste and are by no means a tribe. In several cases, these claims to tribalhood are disputed by tribes who are already listed in the schedule and fear economic losses if more powerful groups are recognised as scheduled tribes; for instance, the Rajbongshi demand faces resistance from the Bodo tribe, and the Meena tribe has vigorously opposed Gujjar aspirations to be recognised as a scheduled tribe. ===Endogamy, exogamy and ethnogenesis=== Part of the challenge is that the endogamous nature of tribes is also conformed to by the vast majority of Hindu castes. Indeed, many historians and anthropologists believe that caste endogamy reflects the once- tribal origins of the various groups who now constitute the settled Hindu castes. Another defining feature of caste Hindu society, which is often used to contrast them with Muslim and other social groupings, is lineage/clan (or gotra) and village exogamy. However, these in-marriage taboos are also held ubiquitously among tribal groups, and do not serve as reliable differentiating markers between caste and tribe. Again, this could be an ancient import from tribal society into settled Hindu castes. Tribes such as the Muslim Gujjars of Kashmir and the Kalash of Pakistan observe these exogamous traditions in common with caste Hindus and non-Kashmiri adivasis, though their surrounding Muslim populations do not. Tribals are not part of the caste system, Some anthropologists, however, draw a distinction between tribes who have continued to be tribal and tribes that have been absorbed into caste society in terms of the breakdown of tribal (and therefore caste) boundaries, and the proliferation of new mixed caste groups. In other words, ethnogenesis (the construction of new ethnic identities) in tribes occurs through a fission process (where groups splinter-off as new tribes, which preserves endogamy), whereas with settled castes it usually occurs through intermixture (in violation of strict endogamy). Tribals and are often regarded as constituting egalitarian societies. However, many scholars argue that the claim that tribals are an egalitarian society in contrast to a caste-based society is a part of a larger political agenda by some to maximise any differences from tribal and urban societies. According to scholar Koenraad Elst, caste practices and social taboos among Indian tribals date back to antiquity: ===Other criteria=== Unlike castes, which form part of a complex and interrelated local economic exchange system, tribes tend to form self- sufficient economic units. For most tribal people, land-use rights traditionally derive simply from tribal membership. Tribal society tends to the egalitarian, with its leadership based on ties of kinship and personality rather than on hereditary status. Tribes typically consist of segmentary lineages whose extended families provide the basis for social organisation and control. Tribal religion recognises no authority outside the tribe. Any of these criteria may not apply in specific instances. Language does not always give an accurate indicator of tribal or caste status. Especially in regions of mixed population, many tribal groups have lost their original languages and simply speak local or regional languages. In parts of Assam‚Äîan area historically divided between warring tribes and villages‚Äîincreased contact among villagers began during the colonial period, and has accelerated since independence in 1947. A pidgin Assamese developed, whereas educated tribal members learnt Hindi and, in the late twentieth century, English. Self- identification and group loyalty do not provide unfailing markers of tribal identity either. In the case of stratified tribes, the loyalties of clan, kin, and family may well predominate over those of tribe. In addition, tribes cannot always be viewed as people living apart; the degree of isolation of various tribes has varied tremendously. The Gonds, Santals, and Bhils traditionally have dominated the regions in which they have lived. Moreover, tribal society is not always more egalitarian than the rest of the rural populace; some of the larger tribes, such as the Gonds, are highly stratified. The apparently wide fluctuation in estimates of South Asia's tribal population through the twentieth century gives a sense of how unclear the distinction between tribal and nontribal can be. India's 1931 census enumerated 22 million tribal people, in 1941 only 10 million were counted, but by 1961 some 30 million and in 1991 nearly 68 million tribal members were included. The differences among the figures reflect changing census criteria and the economic incentives individuals have to maintain or reject classification as a tribal member. These gyrations of census data serve to underline the complex relationship between caste and tribe. Although, in theory, these terms represent different ways of life and ideal types, in reality, they stand for a continuum of social groups. In areas of substantial contact between tribes and castes, social and cultural pressures have often tended to move tribes in the direction of becoming castes over a period of years. Tribal peoples with ambitions for social advancement in Indian society at large have tried to gain the classification of caste for their tribes. On occasion, an entire tribe or part of a tribe joined a Hindu sect and thus entered the caste system en masse. If a specific tribe engaged in practices that Hindus deemed polluting, the tribe's status when it was assimilated into the caste hierarchy would be affected. ===Constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Tribes=== A number of constitutional and juridicial safeguards for Adivasi have been encoded. ===Particularly vulnerable tribal groups=== The Scheduled Tribe groups who were identified as more isolated from the wider community and who maintain a distinctive cultural identity have been categorised as \\"Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups\\" (PVTGs) previously known as Primitive Tribal Groups by the Government at the Centre. So far 75 tribal communities have been identified as 'particularly vulnerable tribal groups' in 18 States and UT of Andaman & Nicobar Islands of India. These hunting, food-gathering, and some agricultural communities have been identified as less acculturated tribes among the tribal population groups and in need of special programmes for their sustainable development. The tribes are awakening and demanding their rights for special reservation quota for them. ==Notable Adivasis== ===Independence movement=== * Rani Gaidinliu (1915-1993) ‚Äì Political leader, freedom fighter * Birsa Munda (1875-1900) ‚Äì Independence activist * Laxman Nayak (1899-1943) ‚Äì Independence activist * Komaram Bheem (1901-1940) ‚Äì Freedom fighter * Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu ‚Äì Independence activists * Baba Tilka Majhi ( d. 1784) ‚Äì Freedom fighter ===Politics and social service=== * Kantilal Bhuria (b. 1950) - Lok Sabha MP, tribal rights activist, former Union Cabinet Minister of Tribal Affairs, Agriculture & Food, veteran Congress leader from Madhya Pradesh. * Kishore Chandra Deo (b. 1947) - Lok Sabha MP, tribal rights activist, former Union Cabinet Minister of Tribal Affairs, Steel & Mines, Tribal Chief of Kurupam, veteran Congress leader from Andhra Pradesh. * Vincent Pala (b. 1968) - Lok Sabha MP, former Union Minister of Water Resources, Congress leader. * Kanjibhai Patel (b. 1936) \\\\- Politician * Lalthanhawla (b. 1942) ‚Äì Politician * Zoramthanga ‚Äì Politician * Jual Oram ‚Äì Politician * Ramvichar Netam ‚Äì Politician * Mahendra Karma ‚Äì Politician * Kartik Oraon ‚Äì Politician * Neiphiu Rio ‚Äì Politician * Kariya Munda ‚Äì Former Deputy Speaker, 15th Lok Sabha * Harishankar Brahma ‚Äì Former Chief Election Commissioner of India * Soni Sori ‚Äì Political activist * Dayamani Barla ‚Äì Journalist, activist * Tulasi Munda ‚Äì Education activist * C K Janu ‚Äì Social activist * Jaipal Singh ‚Äì Hockey player, Adivasi activist. * Sushila Kerketta ‚Äì member of the 14th Lok Sabha of India * Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar Six-time member of the Lok Sabha of India from Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

They speak the Bhil languages, a subgroup of the Western Zone of the Indo-Aryan languages. As of 2013, Bhils were the largest tribal group in India. Bhils are listed as indigenous people of the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan‚Äîall in the western Deccan regions and central India‚Äîas well as in Tripura in far-eastern India, on the border with Bangladesh. Bhils are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. Most Bhils now speak the language of the region they reside in, such as Marathi, Gujarati or a Hindustani dialect. ==History== The Bhils of what is now the state of Gujurat rebelled on several occasions during the British colonial era, notably in 1846, 1857-58 and 1868. The Bhils are inhabitants of Dhar, Jhabua, Khargone and Ratlam districts of Madhya Pradesh. A large number of Bhils live in the neighbouring States of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. They constitute the third largest tribe of India; the first two being Gonds and Santhals Color=\\"red\\" == Present circumstances == The Bhil are classified as a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tripura under the Indian government's reservation program of positive discrimination. == Sub-divisions == The Bhil are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. In Rajasthan, they exist as Meena, Bhil Garasia, Dholi Bhil, Dungri Bhil, Dungri Garasia, Mewasi Bhil, Rawal Bhil, Tadvi Bhil, Bhagalia, Bhilala, Pawra, Vasava and Vasave.

Bhili has about up to 36 identified dialects and pronunciation differs by region. Bhili is based on Gujarati, but dialects of Bhili gradually merge into more widely spoken languages such as Marathi in the southeast and Rajasthani in the northwest. Estimates of individuals speaking the language are often inaccurate as speakers of minor languages like Bhili have sometimes been treated as having major languages (such as Marathi or Gujarati) as their mother tongue. == Culture == Bhils have rich and unique culture. The Bhilala sub-division is known for its Pithora painting. Ghoomar is a traditional folk dance of Bhil tribe. Ghoomar is the symbol of womanhood. Young girls take part in this dance and declare that they are stepping into the shoes of women. === Art === Bhil painting is characterised by the use of multi-coloured dots as in-filling. Bhuri Bai was the first Bhil artist to paint using readymade colours and paper. Other known Bhil artists include Lado Bai, Sher Singh, Ram Singh and Dubu Bariya. === Cuisine === Gujarati Bhil's food storage vessels Main foods of Bhils are maize, onion, garlic and chili which they cultivate in their small fields. They collect fruits and vegetables from the local forests. Wheat and rice are used at time of festivals and other special occasions only. They keep self-made bows and arrows, swords, knives, axes etc with them as weapons for self-defense and hunting the wild fauna which also form the major part of their diet. They profusely use alcohol distilled by them from the flower of Mahua (Madhuca longifolia). On festive occasions, various special preparation from the dish rich, i.e. maize, wheat, barley, malt and rice. Bhils are traditionally non-vegetarian. ===Dress=== The traditional dresses of men are Pagri, Angarkha, Dhoti and Gamchha. Traditionally women wear Sari and Ghagra Choli. There are many traditional ornaments of Bhils. Men wear Kada, Bajuband, Chain, ear rings, Kardhani. Women wear variety of ornaments including hansli, ring, Zele-zumke, earring, narniyan (bangle), nathni (nose-jewel) etc. Tattooing is traditional custom among them. Women folks do tattooing generally before marriage. A Bhil Girl ===Faith and worship=== Every village has its own local deity (Gramdev) and families too have their Jatidev, Kuldev and Kuldevi (house hold deity) which is symbolised by stones. 'Bhati dev' and 'Bhilat dev' are their serpent-god. 'Baba dev' is their village god. Karkulia dev is their crop god, Gopal dev is their pastoral god, Bag dev is their Lion god, Bhairav dev is their dog god. Some of their other gods are Indel dev, Bada dev, Mahadevel, Tejaji, Lotha mai, Techma, Orka Chichma and Kajal dev. They have extreme and staunch faith in superstitious beliefs and Bhopas for their physical, mental and psychological treatments. ===Festivals=== There are a number of festivals, viz.

He began playing professionally at the age of 15 after moving to New York City. He lived for a period with Les Paul and began playing at jazz clubs such as Smalls Paradise. He later moved into a suite in the President Hotel on 48th Street. He would play at Smalls for six months of the year, and then in the summer play at the Club Harlem in Atlantic City. Martino played and recorded early in his career with Lloyd Price, Willis Jackson, and Eric Kloss. He also worked with jazz organists Charles Earland, Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes, Jack McDuff, Don Patterson, Trudy Pitts, Jimmy Smith, Gene Ludwig, and Joey DeFrancesco. Martino had been performing until an aneurysm in 1980 left him with amnesia and no recollection or knowledge of his career or how to play the very instrument that made him successful. Martino says he came out of surgery with complete forgetfulness, learning to focus on the present instead of the past or what may lie ahead. He was forced to learn how to play the guitar from zero. This circumstance is crucial to understand his career and his particular way of thinking. Martino is married to Ayako Asahi Martino, whom he met in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995. He was chosen as Guitar Player of the Year in the Down Beat magazine Readers' Poll of 2004. In 2006, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab reissued his album East! on Ultradisc UHR SACD. In 2017, he shot a series of educational videos entitled A Study of the Opposites and How They Manifest on the Guitar. ==Musical approach== Martino states, \\"There are elements within an instrument‚Äôs architecture that initiate a continuous source of valuable information. For the guitar, there are two. The first is the major third interval, and the second is the minor third interval. Once we view their repetitive information, they begin to appear as a series of automatic functions.\\" Martino's lines contain chromatic links outside any particular IIm7 chord that might be conceptualized over a chord progression, even in the examples he provides in his books and instructional videos. On his bulletin board he has stated that he formulated the system more as a way to explain his playing rather than as something to use to create music. In his own words, \\"although the analysis of some of my recorded solos have been referred to as modal, personally I've never operated in that way. I've always depended upon my own melodic instinct, instead of scale like formulas.\\" ==Awards and honors== Martino in Denmark, 2015 * 1995 Mellon Jazz Festival dedicated in honor * 1996 Philadelphia Alliance Walk of Fame Award * 1997 National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences Songs from the Heart Award * 2002 Grammy Award nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Live at Yoshi's, and Best Jazz Instrumental Solo on \\"All Blues\\" * 2002 National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences 2nd Annual Heroes Award * 2003 Grammy nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Think Tank, and Best Jazz Instrumental Solo on \\"Africa\\" * 2004 Guitar Player of the Year, DownBeat Magazine's 2004 Readers' Poll * 2016 Pennsylvania State Senator Vincent Hughes and his wife Sheryl Lee Ralph-Hughes presented Pat Martino with the Jazz Legacy Award ==Discography== ===As leader=== * El Hombre (Prestige, 1967) * Strings!

It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified. Claudication derives from the Latin verb claudicare, \\"to limp\\". ==Signs and symptoms== One of the hallmarks of arterial claudication is that it occurs intermittently. It disappears after a very brief rest and the patient can start walking again until the pain recurs. The following signs are general signs of atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries: * cyanosis * atrophic changes like loss of hair, shiny skin * decreased temperature * decreased pulse * redness when limb is returned to a \\"dependent\\" position (part of Buerger's test) The six \\"P\\"s of ischemia *Pain *Pallor (increased) *Pulse (decreased) *Perishing cold *Paraesthesia *Paralysis ==Causes== Most commonly, intermittent (or vascular or arterial) claudication is due to peripheral arterial disease which implies significant atherosclerotic blockages resulting in arterial insufficiency. Other uncommon causes are Trousseau disease, Beurger's disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans), in which vasculitis occurs. Raynaud's phenomenon functional vasospasm. It is distinct from neurogenic claudication, which is associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. It is strongly associated with smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. ==Diagnosis== Intermittent claudication is a symptom and is by definition diagnosed by a patient reporting a history of leg pain with walking relieved by rest. However, as other conditions such as sciatica can mimic intermittent claudication, testing is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography appear to be slightly more cost-effective in diagnosing peripheral artery disease among people with intermittent claudication than projectional angiography. ==Treatment== Exercise can improve symptoms, as can revascularization. Both together may be better than one intervention of its own. In people with stable leg pain, exercise, such as strength training, polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises, compared to usual care or placebo improves maximum walking time, pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance. Alternative exercise modes, such as cycling, strength training and upper-arm ergometry compared to supervised walking programmes showed no difference in maximum walking distance or pain-free walking distance for people with intermittent claudication. Pharmacological options exist, as well. Medicines that control lipid profile, diabetes, and hypertension may increase blood flow to the affected muscles and allow for increased activity levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, adrenergic agents such as alpha-1 blockers and beta-blockers and alpha-2 agonists, antiplatelet agents (aspirin and clopidogrel), naftidrofuryl, pentoxifylline, and cilostazol (selective PDE3 inhibitor) are used for the treatment of intermittent claudication. However, medications will not remove the blockages from the body. Instead, they simply improve blood flow to the affected area. Catheter- based intervention is also an option. Atherectomy, stenting, and angioplasty to remove or push aside the arterial blockages are the most common procedures for catheter-based intervention. These procedures can be performed by interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and thoracic surgeons, among others. Surgery is the last resort; vascular surgeons can perform either endarterectomies on arterial blockages or perform an arterial bypass. However, open surgery poses a host of risks not present with catheter-based interventions. ==Epidemiology== Atherosclerosis affects up to 10% of the Western population older than 65 years and for intermittent claudication this number is around 5%. Intermittent claudication most commonly manifests in men older than 50 years. One in five of the middle-aged (65‚Äì75 years) population of the United Kingdom have evidence of peripheral arterial disease on clinical examination, although only a quarter of them have symptoms. The most common symptom is muscle pain in the lower limbs on exercise‚Äîintermittent claudication. ==See also== *Peripheral artery disease ==References== ==Further reading== * * == External links == * Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group * QUANTAFLO Peripheral Arterial Disease Test Category:Symptoms and signs: Vascular Category:Vascular diseases Category:Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries ","title":"Intermittent claudication"},{"id":"1298494","text":"Lesya UkrainkaNote: \\"Ukrainka\\" literally means \\"Ukrainian woman\\" in Ukrainian () (born Larysa Petrivna Kosach-Kvitka () ( ‚Äì ) is one of Ukrainian literature's foremost writers, best known for her poems and plays. She was also an active political, civil, and feminist activist.Krys Svitlana, A Comparative Feminist Reading of Lesia Ukrainka‚Äôs and Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs Dramas. Canadian Review of Comparative Literature 34.4 (December 2007 [September 2008]): 389-409 Among her most well-known works are the collections of poems On the wings of songs (1893), Thoughts and Dreams (1899), Echos (1902), the epic poem Ancient fairy tale (1893), One word (1903), plays Princess (1913), Cassandra (1903‚Äî1907), In the Catacombs (1905), and Forest song (1911). ==Biography== Ukrainka was born in 1871 in the town of Novohrad-Volynskyi of Ukraine. She was the second child of Ukrainian writer and publisher Olha Drahomanova-Kosach, better known under her literary pseudonym Olena Pchilka. Ukrainka's father was Petro Antonovych Kosach (from Serbian Kosaƒça noble family), head of the district assembly of conciliators, who came from the northern part of Chernihiv province. After completing high school in Chernihiv Gymnasium, Kosach studied mathematics at the University of Petersburg. Two years later, he moved to Kyiv University and graduated with a degree in law. In 1868 he married Olha Drahomaniv, who was the sister of his friend Mykhaylo Petrovych Drahomanov, a well-known Ukrainian scientist, historian, philosopher, folklorist and public figure. Kosach, her father, was devoted to the advancement of Ukrainian culture and financially supported Ukrainian publishing ventures. Lesya Ukrainka had three younger sisters, Olha, Oksana, and Isydora, and a younger brother, Mykola. Ukrainka was very close to her uncle Drahomanov, her spiritual mentor and teacher, as well as her brother Mykhaylo, known under the pseudonym Mykhaylo Obachny, whom she called \\"Mysholosie.\\" Lesya inherited her father's features, eyes, height, and build. Like her father, she was highly principled, and they both held the dignity of the individual in high regard. Despite their many similarities, Lesya and her father were different in that her father had a gift for mathematics, but no gift for languages; on the contrary, Lesya had no gift for mathematics, but she knew English, German, French, Italian, Greek, Latin, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and her native Ukrainian. Lesya's mother, a poet, wrote poetry and short stories for children in Ukrainian. She was also active in the women's movement and published a feminist almanac.:uk:–õ–µ—Å—è –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∫–∞ Ukrainka's mother played a significant role in her upbringing. The Ukrainian language was the only language used in the household, and to enforce this practice, the children were educated by Ukrainian tutors at home, in order to avoid schools that taught Russian as the primary language. Ukrainka learned how to read at the age of four, and she and her brother Mykhaylo could read foreign languages well enough to read literature in the original.Wedel, Erwin. Toward a modern Ukrainian drama: innovative concepts and devices in Lesia Ukrainka‚Äôs dramatic art, in Slavic Drama, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada 1991, p 116. By the time she was eight, Ukrainka wrote her first poem, \\"Hope,\\" which was composed in reaction to the arrest and exile of her aunt, Olena Kosach, for taking part in a political movement against the tsarist autocracy. In 1879, her entire family moved to Lutsk. That same year her father started building houses for the family in the nearby village of Kolodiazhne. It was at this time that her uncle, Mykhaylo Drahomanov, encouraged her to study Ukrainian folk songs, folk stories, and history, as well to peruse the Bible for its inspired poetry and eternal themes. She also was influenced by the well-known composer Mykola Lysenko, as well as the famous Ukrainian dramatist and poet Mykhailo Starytsky.Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha. Feminists Despite Themselves: Women in Ukrainian Community Life, 1884-1939. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1988. At age thirteen, her first published poem, \\"Lily of the Valley,\\" appeared in the magazine Zorya in Lviv. It was here that she first used her pseudonym, which was suggested by her mother because in the Russian Empire, publications in the Ukrainian language were forbidden. Ukrainka's first collection of poetry had to be published secretly in western Ukraine and snuck into Kyiv under her pseudonym. At this time, Ukrainka was well on her way of becoming a pianist, but due to tuberculosis of the bone, she did not attend any outside educational establishment. Writing was to be the main focus of her life. The poems and plays of Ukrainka are associated with her belief in her country's freedom and independence. Between 1895 and 1897, she became a member of the Literary and Artistic Society in Kyiv, which was banned in 1905 because of its relations with revolutionary activists. In 1888, when Ukrainka was seventeen, she and her brother organized a literary circle called Pleyada (The Pleiades), which they founded to promote the development of Ukrainian literature and translation of foreign classics into Ukrainian. The organization was based on the French school of poesy, the Pleiade. Their gatherings took place in different homes and were joined by Mykola Lysenko, P. Kosach, Kostiantyn Mykhalchuk, Mykhailo Starytsky, and others. One of the works they translated was Nikolai Gogol's Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka. Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko were the main inspiration of her early poetry, which was associated with the poet's loneliness, social isolation and adoration of the Ukrainian nation's freedom. Her first collection of poetry, Na krylakh pisen' (On the Wings of Songs), was published in 1893. Since Ukrainian publications were banned by the Russian Empire, this book was published in Western Ukraine, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time, and smuggled into Kyiv. Ukrainka's illness made it necessary for her to travel to places where the climate was dry, and, as a result, she spent extended periods of time in Germany, Austria, Italy, Bulgaria, Crimea, the Caucasus, and Egypt. She loved experiencing other cultures, which was evident in many of her literary works, such as The Ancient History of Oriental Peoples, originally written for her younger siblings. The book was published in L'viv, and Ivan Franko was involved in its publication. It included her early poems, such as \\"Seven Strings,\\" \\"The Starry Sky,\\" \\"Tears-Pearls,\\" \\"The Journey to the Sea,\\" \\"Crimean Memories,\\" and \\"In the Children's Circle.\\" Ukrainka also wrote epic poems, prose dramas, prose, several articles of literary criticism, and a number of sociopolitical essays. She was best known for her plays Boyarynya (1914; The Noblewoman), a psychological tragedy centered on the Ukrainian family in the 17th century, which refers directly to Ukrainian history, and Lisova pisnya (1912; The Forest Song), the characters of which include mythological beings from Ukrainian folklore. In 1897, while being treated in Yalta, Ukrainka met Serhiy Merzhynsky, an official from Minsk who was also receiving treatment for tuberculosis. The two fell in love, and her feelings for Merzhynsky were responsible for her showing a different side of herself. Examples include \\"Your Letters Always Smell of Withered Roses,\\" \\"To Leave Everything and Fly to You,\\" and \\"I'd Like to Wind around You Like Ivy,\\" which were unpublished in her lifetime. Merzhynsky died with Ukrainka at his bedside on 3 March 1901. She wrote the entire dramatic poem \\"Oderzhyma\\" (\\"The Possessed\\") in one night at his deathbed. Ukrainka actively opposed Russian tsarism and was a member of Ukrainian Marxist organizations. In 1902 she translated the Communist Manifesto into Ukrainian. She was briefly arrested in 1907 by tsarist police and remained under surveillance thereafter. In 1907, Ukrainka married Klyment Kvitka, a court official, who was an amateur ethnographer and musicologist. They settled first in Crimea, then moved to Georgia. Ukrainka died on 1 August 1913 at a health resort in Surami, Georgia. ==Legacy== File:Lesia R.jpgUkrainian karbovanets depicting Lesya Ukrainka File:The Soviet Union 1971 CPA 3984 stamp (Lesya Ukrayinka (Larysa Petrivna Kosach-Kvitka, 1871-1913), Ukrainian Writer).jpgSoviet four-kopeck stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of Lesya Ukrainka's birth File:200 hryvnia 2007 front.jpgPortrait on obverse ‚Ç¥200 bill circa 2007 File:Lesya Ukrainka 2013.JPGLesya Ukrainka Statue, University of Saskatchewan File:–õ–µ—Å—è- –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∫–∞.JPGLesya Ukrainka's burial location and monument at Baikove Cemetery in Kyiv File:Lesya Ukrainka.jpg File:Monument √† Lessia Oukra√Ønka.jpgStatue of Lesya Ukrainka by Mykailo Chereshniovsky erected in 1975 in High Park, in Toronto, Canada.

There are many monuments to Lesya Ukrainka in Ukraine and many other former Soviet Republics. Particularly in Kyiv, there is a main monument at the boulevard that bears her name and a smaller monument in the Mariyinsky Park (next to Mariyinsky Palace). There is also a bust in Garadagh raion of Azerbaijan. One of the main Kyiv theaters, the Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater of Russian Drama is colloquially referred to simply as Lesya Ukrainka Theater. Under initiatives of local Ukrainian diasporas, there are several memorial societies and monuments to her throughout Canada and the United States, most notably a monument on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.Swyripa, Francis. Wedded to the Cause, Ukrainian-Canadian Women and Ethnic Identity 1891-1991. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1993, p. 234. There is also a bust of Ukrainka in Soyuzivka in New York State. Each summer since 1975, Ukrainians in Toronto gather at the Lesya Ukrainka monument in High Park to celebrate her life and work. On 28 May 2007, the National Bank of Ukraine released a 200-hryvnia banknote depicting Lesya Ukrainka. According to image consultant Oleh Pokalchuk, Ukrainka's hairstyle inspired the over- the-head braid of Yulia Tymoshenko. ==English translations== *The Babylonian Captivity, (play), from Five Russian Plays, With One From the Ukrainian, Dutton, NY, 1916. from Archive.org; * In the Catacombs (play) translated by David Turow; * Short stories; ‚ÄúChristmas Eve‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Moth‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpring Songs‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt is Late‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Only Son‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe School‚Äù, ‚ÄúHappiness‚Äù, ‚ÄúA City of Sorrow‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Farewell‚Äù, ‚ÄúSonorous Strings‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Letter to a Distant Shore‚Äù, ‚ÄúBy the Sea‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Blind Man‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Apparition‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Mistake‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Moment‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Conversation‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Enemies‚Äù translated by Roma Franko;Ukrainka L., 1998, From Heart to Heart, pp.288-468, Language Lantern Publications, Toronto, (Engl. transl.) *The Forest Song, (play), in \\"In a Different Light: A Bilingual Anthology of Ukrainian Literature Translated into English by Virlana Tkacz and Wanda Phipps as Performed by Yara Arts Group\\", compiled and edited by Olha Luchuk, Sribne Slovo Press, Lviv 2008. == Theatrical adaptations of works == * 1994 Yara's Forest Song directed by Virlana Tkacz with Yara Arts Group at La MaMa Experimental Theatre in New York and Les Kurbas Theatre in Lviv * 2013 Fire Water Night directed by Virlana Tkacz with Yara Arts Group at La MaMa Experimental Theatre in New York ==See also== * Lesya Ukrainka Theater * Olha Kobylianska ==References== ==External links== * Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine: Lesya Ukrainka * * Women's Voices in Ukrainian Literature: Lesya Ukrainka by Roma Franko * Lesya Ukrainka Statue in High Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada * The site: \\"Let the World know about our Lesya\\" the result of the students schools #3 of Sevastopol in the project \\"Lesya-140\\".

The book is significant because in the later Middle Ages dozens of such courtesy books were produced. Because this appears to be the first in English history, it represented a new awakening to etiquette and decorum in English court society, which occurred in the 13th century. As a general rule, a book of etiquette is a mark of a dynamic rather than a stable society, one in which there is an influx of \\"new\\" men, who have not been indoctrinated with the correct decorum from an early age and who are avid to catch up in a hurry. ==The poem== Civilized Man is a 3000-line Latin verse poem that gives proper advice on a wide range of social situations that the typical medieval person might have encountered in day-to-day life. Examples include: *If you wish to belch, remember to look up to the ceiling. *Do not attack your enemy while he is squatting to defecate. *If there is something you do not want people to know, do not tell it to your wife. *Say thank you to your host. *Don't mount your horse in the hall. *If visitors had already eaten, give them drink anyway. *Loosen your reins when riding over a bridge. *Receive gifts from great men with gratitude. *If you are a judge, be just. *Eating at the table of the rich, speak little. *The book ends with \\"Old King Henry first gave to the uncourtly the teaching written in this book.\\" ==The poet== Historians believe that Daniel of Beccles may have been a member of Henry II's court. John Bale (16th century) wrote that he had seen a document showing Daniel in Henry's court for over 30 years. This, the fact that a Henry is mentioned in the text, and some of the manuscripts can be dated to the early 13th century, make it very probable the poem dates from that period. There a reference to a Daniel of Beccles in the \\"Seventh Regnal Year of King John\\" (circa 1206) secretly being given the patronage (advowson) of the church of Endgate in Beccles by the Abbot of Bury St Edmund's. ==Three themes== There are three major recurrent themes in the poem: social hierarchy, self-control and sexual morality. The first theme is the emphasis on social hierarchy and how to behave around those of higher or lower status (lords and servants). The poem takes the general tone of addressing the reader as someone who is a \\"householder\\". This can be seen in the opening lines of the poem \\"Reader, if you wish to be adorned with good manners, if you wish to be respected and lead a civilized life as a noble householder...\\". In other words, it addresses a very minor upper percentage of the general population who own households and have servants, the class that from the 16th century might be identified as \\"country gentry\\". The second recurrent theme is self-control, in general holding oneself inward when it comes to speaking, eating and bodily emissions. When it comes to speaking, \\"Be careful to whom, what, why and when you speak\\". He suggests it is better to keep your thoughts to yourself. When it comes to eating, he suggests small bites, not overeating, not playing with food, no using fingers to clean bowls. Also, guests and servants should not urinate in the dining hall, but the host may. The third recurrent theme is sexual morality. The Civilized Man was clearly written for men. It offers advice on prostitutes: \\"If you are overcome with erotic desire when you are young and your penis drives you to go to a prostitute, do not go to a common whore; empty your testicles quickly and depart quickly.\\" He offers advice on how to pick a wife, which includes looking at her property value and personal traits. Following a tradition inherited from antiquity, Daniel describes women as lustful and untrustworthy. The poem describes a woman lying in bed with her husband, with her thoughts on to her secret lover: \\"The lascivious woman throws herself around the neck of her lover, her fingers give him those secret touches that she denies to her husband in bed; one wicked act with her lover pleases the lascivious adulteress more than a hundred with her husband; women's minds always burn for the forbidden.\\" He says she is always ready to fornicate \\"with a cook or a half-wit, a peasant or a ploughman, or a chaplain... what she longs for is a thick, leaping, robust piece of equipment, long, smooth and stiff... such are the things that charm and delight women\\". Daniel had a nearly pathological view of the promiscuity of women, but despite this he says \\"Whatever your wife does, do not damage your marriage\\" and he goes on to say \\"if you are jealous, do not whisper a word about it... when you are jealous, learn to look up at the ceiling.\\" The message is clearly in the same theme of holding inward and avoiding any embarrassments at all cost. Daniel's advice comes to a climax in what is perhaps the most difficult situation of all: the wife of one's lord makes a sexual proposition. It is a combination of the three problems: hierarchical relationships, control of bodily emissions, and sexual morality. Daniel's solution? Pretend to be ill. ==See also== *Medieval literature ==References== *Urbanus Magnus Danielis Becclesiensis, ed. J.

It lies closer to the village of Agno than to Lugano itself, and is sometimes known as Lugano-Agno. Around 200,000 passengers use the airport each year, using some 2,400 flights. There are also limited freight operations, a flying club and flight school. The headquarters of Darwin Airline were located at the airport prior to its bankruptcy.austrianaviation.net - \\"Final over and out for Darwin Airline\\" (German) 12 December 2017 The airport is situated on land owned by the city of Lugano, whilst management is the responsibility of Lugano Airport SA, whose shares are owned by the canton of Ticino (12.5%) and the city (87.5%). The company has 73 employees, and an annual turnover of 10 million Swiss francs. ==History== The current location of the airport dates back to 1938, when it opened as a grass field. The first paved runway was laid in 1960, and originally had a length of and a width of . Initially managed by private sector companies, the airport was taken over by the Azienda comunale dei trasporti della Citt√† di Lugano, Lugano's municipal transport company, in 1974. In the early 1980s, the airline Crossair decided to invest in the airport, establishing connections between Lugano and various European cities. In 1985, the runway was extended by , and in 1989 a new control tower became operational. After the demise of Adria Airways in September 2019, which operated the route to Z√ºrich Airport on behalf of Swiss International Air Lines, Lugano lost its sole year-round scheduled service as Swiss will refer its passengers to train services in the future without resuming the flights.nzz.ch - \\"Lugano Airport in trouble\\" (German) 6 October 2019 In April 2020, the company behind the airport serving Lugano, Switzerland opted to put itself into liquidation after the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed air traffic at the location.https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/airports-routes/swiss- airport-files-liquidation-pandemic-halts-traffic ==Facilities== ===Terminal=== The airport has a single passenger terminal building, with airline ticket and check-in desks, airport security and customs facilities. There is an air side departure lounge with duty-free shop, bar and snack bar. Boarding of aircraft is generally on foot across the apron, although sometimes buses are used when the aircraft is not parked directly next to the terminal building. An adjacent building to the terminal building houses the ground side airport restaurant and flying club, with outdoor seating under an awning between the two buildings. Other ground side catering and shopping outlets are situated around an adjacent open courtyard. ===Runway=== The airport has a single, bidirectional runway with an asphalt surface, identified as 01/19. The runway is long, wide, and above mean sea level. There is no parallel taxiway, and aircraft arrivals and departures often involve backtracking on the runway. The airport's instrument approach procedure is quite challenging because of its steep angle of descent of 6.65¬∞, more than double the standard approach angle of 3¬∞ and steeper than London City's 5.5¬∞. This is due to its geographic location in the mouth of a valley. ==Airlines and destinations== Apron overview The following airline offers seasonal flights at Lugano Airport:lugano-airport.ch - Destinations retrieved 20 June 2020 The nearest major international airport is Milan‚ÄìMalpensa Airport in Italy, approx. to the south. ==Ground transportation== ===Road=== The airport is some from Lugano city centre by road, and a similar distance from the nearest junctions on the A2 motorway. It has both long and short term parking, a taxi rank, and a selection of car hire companies. ===Train=== A shuttle bus connects the airport with Lugano railway station and city centre, meeting most scheduled flights. Agno railway station is a sign-posted ten-minute walk from the airport, and trains connect to Lugano and Ponte Tresa every 15 minutes on weekdays or 30 minutes at weekends. ==See also== * Transport in Switzerland ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Lugano Airport Qualification -- Information for pilots * P3 Flyers Ticino aerobatic team based at Lugano Airport * Category:Airports in Switzerland Category:Transport in Lugano Category:Airports in Ticino ","title":"Lugano Airport"},{"id":"1298531","text":"Statuette from Hacilar (5250-5000 BC), National Archaeological Museum (Florence) Hacilar is an early human settlement in southwestern Turkey, 23 km south of present-day Burdur. It has been dated back 7040 BC at its earliest stage of development. Archaeological remains indicate that the site was abandoned and reoccupied on more than one occasion in its history. ==Archaeological History== Terracotta vase painted in red from Ha√ßilar. Late Neolithic - early Chalcolithic (late 6th - beginning of the 5th millennium BC). Rome, National Museum of Oriental Art (Palazzo Brancaccio) Hacilar lived and died in prehistory. What remained of Hacilar became a mound on the plain and remained so until 1956. It was in this year that a local teacher showed the mound to British archaeologist James Mellaart. In 1957 the excavation of Hacilar began under Mellaart's direction and continued until 1960. The artifacts recovered during this excavation are currently on display at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. Ceramics from Hacilar show similarities with those of the Halaf culture from about the same period. There are also similarities in their figurines. ===Stratigraphy=== Up to 11 stratigraphic levels have been identified. The oldest strata belong to aceramic Neolithic, and are dated to the 8th millennium BC.Based on Spanish Wikipedia, see refs there To the 6th millennium BC, nine levels are assigned, the oldest with ceramics, that were almost entirely undecorated. Level VI is dating back to 5600 BC, and there were many activities at this time. Nine buildings were found, grouped around a square. Livelihood mainly consisted of agriculture. Spelt, wheat, barley, peas and vetch were cultivated. Villagers engaged in the breeding of animals; bones of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and dogs were found. The pottery is simple, although some specimens represent animals.Helbaek H (1970) The plant husbandry of Hacilar: a study of cultivation and domestication. In: Mellaart J, editor. Excavations at Hacilar. Edinburgh: University Press Numerous nude female figures, made of clay, are quite remarkable, and possibly represent some divinity. At level II (c. 5300 BC), the village was fortified and had a small temple. The settlement of level I, dating after 5000 BC, differs significantly from the previous layers, so it is believed that there were newcomers who settled here. The site is now heavily fortified. The pottery is of high quality and is generally painted in red on a cream background. ==Architecture== Housing in Hacilar consisted of grouped units surrounding an inner courtyard. Each dwelling was built on a foundation of stone to protect against water damage. Walls were made of wood and daub or mud-brick that was mortared with lime. Wooden poles were located within each unit to support a flat roof. It is generally believed that these houses had an upper story made of wood. The interiors were finished smooth with plaster and were rarely painted. Over time changes were made to the housing units; Querns, braziers and mortars appeared in the floors. Recesses in walls were also put to good use as cupboards. The kitchen was separated from the living rooms and the upper levels were used for granaries and/or workshops. As Mellaart describes: 'The walls and floors were carefully plastered, laid on a pebble base. The plaster was frequently stained red and burnished or decorated with elementary geometric designs in red on cream.' In Hacilar houses no doorways were found. It seems possible that the entry was from the roof only.Mellaart, J. 1965.

He meets Peter and Tim Cratchit, sons of his uncle Ebenezer's clerk, Bob Cratchit. When Fred reveals who he is, the boys take off in terror. Fred soon arrives at the counting-house of his miserly maternal uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge. After declining an invitation from his nephew to dine with him on Christmas, Scrooge rejects two gentlemen collecting money for charity. That night, Scrooge reluctantly allows his employee Bob Cratchit to have Christmas off with pay but orders him back all the earlier the day after. Later Bob accidentally knocks off Scrooge's hat with a snowball. Scrooge dismisses Bob and withholds a week's pay to compensate for his ruined hat, also demanding a shilling to make up the difference. Scrooge fires Bob for damaging his hat. Bob spends the last of his wages on food for his family's Christmas dinner. In his house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns Scrooge to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife as Marley was. He tells Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits. At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the youthful Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to his early life. Scrooge is shown his unhappiness when he was left to spend the holidays alone at school, and his joy when his sister, Fran, came to take him home for Christmas. The spirit reminds Scrooge that Fran, dead for some years, is the mother of his nephew. Scrooge is shown his early career in business and money lending as an employee under Fezziwig. At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how others keep Christmas. At a church service, Fred and his fianc√©e, Bess, are seen as happy and in love. The couple must wait to marry because of Fred's financial circumstances, and the spirit observes that perhaps they will not marry at all and their love may end, just as Scrooge lost his fianc√©e in his youth. Scrooge is then shown the Cratchit home. Despite wearing a cheery manner for his family's sake, Bob is deeply troubled by the loss of his job, though he confides in no one except his daughter Martha. The spirit hints that Bob's youngest son, Tim, will die of a crippling illness by the same time next year if things do not change. At three o'clock, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives, appearing as a silent, cloaked figure. The spirit shows Scrooge what will happen if he does not change. Scrooge discovers Tiny Tim is dead and his family mourns for him. Scrooge also discovers that his own death will not be mourned. Scrooge promises to repent and returns home. Awakening in his own bed on Christmas Day, Scrooge is a changed man. He orders a boy in the street to buy a turkey for him, meaning to take it to the Cratchits. Running into the two men who petitioned him for charity the evening before, Scrooge gives a large donation. He visits Fred and makes him his new partner, then goes to the Cratchit house where he rehires Bob and increases his wages. ==Cast== * Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge * Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit * Kathleen Lockhart as Mrs. Cratchit * Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim Cratchit * Barry MacKay as Fred (Scrooge's nephew) * Lynne Carver as Bess (Fred's fianc√©e) * Bunny Beatty as Martha Cratchit (uncredited) * June Lockhart as Belinda Cratchit (uncredited) * John O'Day as Peter Cratchit (uncredited) * Leo G.

Terry Kilburn, better known for his portrayal of Colley in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, costarred as Tiny Tim and a young June Lockhart (Gene and Kathleen's daughter) made her screen debut as one of the Cratchit daughters. Leo G. Carroll played Marley's Ghost. The characters of Fred (Scrooge's nephew) and Elizabeth, his fiance√© (his wife in the novelette), were greatly expanded in order to work in a romantic angle to the story that Dickens did not intend. The couple was played by Barry MacKay and Lynne Carver. Ann Rutherford, better known as Polly Benedict in the MGM Andy Hardy film series and as Carreen O'Hara in Gone with the Wind, was a young and attractive Ghost of Christmas Past, rather than the somewhat unusual creation that Dickens described. The music for the film was composed by Franz Waxman, in contrast to most MGM films of the period, whose scores were composed by Herbert Stothart. Some of the grimmer aspects of the story went completely unmentioned or unseen, in order to make this a \\"family film\\" in the style of other MGM literary adaptations, and also to accommodate a 69-minute run time. Although Marley's Ghost did appear, the phantoms wailing outside Scrooge's window were not shown. Scrooge's fianc√©e, who eventually leaves him because of his miserly ways, was completely dropped from the film, as were the two starving children \\"Want\\" and \\"Ignorance\\", who hid within the folds of the Ghost of Christmas Present's robe. Also gone were the thieves who ransack Scrooge's belongings after he \\"dies\\" in the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come segment. While Gene Lockhart's performance as Bob Cratchit is admired, he is often criticized for looking too \\"well-fed\\" for the role. In this production, unlike Dickens' original story, Scrooge actually fires Cratchit rather than just threatening to do so. One of the changes made in this film that differs from the novel is the arrival of the ghosts. While the first still arrives at 1:00 a.m., the second appears at 2:00 and the third appears at 3:00. In the original novel, the second appears the next night at 1:00 and the last appears the third night when the last stroke of 12:00 has ceased to vibrate. This change was also used in other versions such as Scrooge (1970), Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983), and A Christmas Carol (1984). ==Theatrical release== Originally intended as a 1939 release, A Christmas Carol was rushed into production in October 1938 and was finished in a matter of weeks. It opened in December 1938 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall where it did moderately well. One of many adaptations of the work, it was frequently revived in theaters by MGM. ==Television broadcast== The film was shown on local television stations in the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and was a staple of Chicago's WGN television's Family Classics. It ran in syndication throughout the United States from the 1960s to the 1990s on various local networks until the advent of cable television. Since the late 1990s, it has been broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, airing several times during December. ==Home media== In 1988, MGM/UA Home Video and Turner Entertainment released A Christmas Carol on VHS celebrating its 50th anniversary, for the first time in a colorized version. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 1988 promoting the film's release on home video, actress June Lockhart admitted that, despite being an MGM production, it was \\"a 'B' picture\\". The colorized version was released once again on VHS by Warner Home Video in 2000. On November 8, 2005, the black and white version was released on DVD in a \\"Classic Holiday Collection\\" box set including Boys Town and Christmas in Connecticut, two other MGM titles with a holiday/family theme; it was also released as an individual title. Since its first DVD release, it has seen multiple releases in various Christmas movie collection box sets. A Blu-ray version was released in November 2014. == See also == * List of ghost films * List of A Christmas Carol adaptations ==References* * * A Christmas Carol: With Original Illustrations in Full Color Print Edition Category:1938 films Category:1930s ghost films Category:American Christmas drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Franz Waxman Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Films directed by Edwin L.

From 1920‚Äì1921 he studied at the Art Students League of New York, after which, having determined to become an artist he left high school at the age of 17 and worked his passage to Europe on a merchant ship. He traveled in France and Germany for a year. He lived in Paris for 6 months during which time he visited the Louvre Museum every day and audited classes at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. He spent the next year travelling in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and other part of Central Europe, visiting museums and art galleries. When he returned, he was one of the most traveled New York Artists. After his return to New York, he studied at the Art Students League, Parsons School of Design, Cooper Union and the Educational Alliance. ==1920s and 1930s== Gottlieb had his first solo exhibition at the Dudensing Galleries in New York City in 1930. During the 1920s and early 1930s he formed lifelong friendships with other artists such as Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Milton Avery, and John Graham. In 1935, he and nine others, including Ben-Zion, Joseph Solman, Ilya Bolotowsky, Louis Harris, Jack Kufeld, Mark Rothko, and Louis Schanker, known as ‚ÄúThe Ten‚Äù, exhibited their works together until 1940. From September 1937 to June 1938, Gottlieb lived in the Arizona desert, outside of Tucson. In those 9 months, he radically changed his approach to painting. He moved from an expressionist-realist style to an approach that combined elements of surrealism and formalist abstraction, using objects and scenes from the local environment as symbols to remove temporality from his work. He transitioned from this into more Surrealist works like the Sea Chest, which displays mysterious incongruities on an otherwise normal landscape. It is then that he conveys to the viewer the expansiveness he must have felt looking at Arizona desert sky, although he distills this expansiveness into a more basic abstract form. \\"I think the emotional feeling I had was that it was like being at sea ‚Ä¶Then there's the tremendous clarity ‚Äì out in Arizona there's a tremendous clarity of light and at night the clouds seem very close.‚ÄùFriedman, Martin. \\"Interview with Adolph Gottlieb\\" Typescript of tape recordings, East Hampton, 1962 When these Arizona works were exhibited in New York after Gottlieb's return they created a break with Gottlieb's former circle of colleagues, several of whom condemned his new work for being ‚Äútoo abstract‚Äù.Interview of Esther Gottlieb Conducted by Phyllis Tuchman, October 22, 1981 This interview was conducted as part of the Archives of American Art‚Äôs Mark Rothko and His Times oral history project, with funding provided by the Mark Rothko Foundation ==1940s‚Äì1950s== Gottlieb and a small circle of friends valued the work of the Surrealist group that they saw exhibited in New York in the 1930s. They also exchanged copies of the magazine \\"Cahiers d‚Äôart\\" and were quite familiar with current ideas about automatic writing and subconscious imagery. Gottlieb painted a few works in a Surrealist style in 1940 and 1941. The results of his experiments manifested themselves in his series ‚ÄúPictographs‚Äù which spanned from 1941‚Äì1950. In his painting Voyager‚Äôs Return , he juxtaposes these images in compartmentalized spaces. His images appear similar to those of indigenous populations of North America and the Ancient Near East. If he found out one of his symbols was not original, he no longer used it. He wanted his art to have the same impact on all his viewers, striking a chord not because they had seen it before, but because it was so basic and elemental that it resounded within them. In 1941, disappointed with the art around him, he developed the approach he called Pictographs. Gottlieb's Pictographs, which he created from 1941 to 1954, are the first coherent body of mature painting by an American of his generation. Gottlieb spoke of his concerns in a 1947 statement: \\"The role of artist has always been that of image-maker. Different times require different images. Today, when our aspirations have been reduced to a desperate attempt to escape from evil, and times are out of joint, our obsessive, subterranean and pictographic images are the expression of the neurosis which is our reality. To my mind certain so-called abstraction is not abstraction at all. On the contrary, it is the realism of our time\\".Adolph Gottileb, excerpt from \\"The Ides of Art\\", The Tiger's Eye, vol I, no. 2, December, 1947, p.43 In May 1942, his first \\"pictograph\\" was displayed at the second annual exhibition of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors, located at the Wildenstein Galleries in New York In his Pictographs, Gottlieb introduced a new way of approaching abstraction that included imagery drawn from his subconscious but which notably departed from the idea of narrative. To meet this goal Gottlieb presented images inserted into sections of a loosely drawn grid. Each image existed independently of the others, yet their arrangement on the same plane, along with relationships of color, texture, and shape, force the viewer to associate them. Meaning, then, is intensely personal ‚Äì another innovation of Gottlieb's paintings Surrealist biomorphism was one source for his Pictographs. For Gottlieb, biomorphism was a way to freely express his unconscious, in which he had become fascinated via [John] Graham, Freud, and Surrealism. Gottlieb also incorporated automatism ‚Äì the painterly technique for Freudian free-association ‚Äì was the method Gottlieb used to generate biomorphic shapes, which were forms spontaneously conceived in his unconscious . These biomorphic shapes were separated by the all over grid pattern, which served as the overall structure of the \\"pictograph\\" series. Gottlieb once said, \\"If I made a wriggly line or a serpentine line it was because I wanted a serpentine line. Afterwards it would suggest a snake but when I made it, it did not suggest anything. It was purely shape... \\". These lines and shapes that Gottlieb used were easily interpreted to mean different things by different people.Seckler, Dorothy. \\"Interview with Adolph Gottlieb\\" Typescript of a tape recording, New York, October 25, 1967 By 1950 Gottlieb observed that the \\"all-over painting\\" approach had become a clich√© for American abstract painting. He began his new series Imaginary Landscapes he retained his usage of a ‚Äòpseudo-language,‚Äô but added the new element of space. He was not painting landscapes in the traditional sense, rather he modified that genre to match his own style of painting.Imaginary Landscapes are horizontal canvasses divided into 2 registers, one very active below a more contemplative upper one, set up a different approach to abstraction at mid-century. In 1955 Gottlieb remarked: I frequently hear the question, ‚ÄúWhat do these images mean?‚Äù This is simply the wrong question. Visual images do not have to conform to either verbal thinking or optical facts. A better question would be ‚ÄúDo these images convey any emotional truth?‚ÄùPainting Aims, written for The New Decade exhibition at the Whitney Museum in 1955 Late in 1956 Gottlieb formulated the image that has become known as the ‚ÄúBurst‚Äù and spent most of the next 2 years working on this approach. He simplifies his representation down to two disc shapes and winding masses. His paintings are variations with these elements arranged in different ways. This series, unlike the Imaginary Landscape series, suggests a basic landscape with a sun and a ground. On another level, the shapes are so rudimentary; they are not limited to this one interpretation. Gottlieb was a masterful colorist as well and in the Burst series his use of color is particularly crucial. He is considered one of the first color field painters and is one of the forerunners of Lyrical Abstraction. Gottlieb's career was marked by the evolution of space and universality. ==1960s‚Äì1970s== By 1960 Gottlieb's efforts on his \\"Burst\\" series, allowed him to greatly simplify his use of imagery. Gottlieb created ‚ÄúBurst‚Äù and ‚ÄúImaginary Landscape‚Äù type paintings for the remainder of his career but, unlike some of his colleagues, he did not limit himself to one or two images.Discussion of Gottlieb's art is usually limited to mentions of ‚ÄúBursts‚Äù or ‚ÄúImaginary Landscapes‚Äù, which detracts from the broad range of ideas this artist examined. Gottlieb summarized his aims in a 1967 interview: > But to me everything is nature, including any feelings that I have ‚Äì or > dreams. Everything is part of nature. Even painting has become part of > nature. To clarify further: I don‚Äôt have an ideological approach or a > doctrinaire approach to my work. I just paint from my personal feelings, and > my reflexes and instincts. I have to trust these.Gruen, John. The Party‚Äôs > Over Now: Reminiscences of the Fifties, New York: The Viking Press, 1967 A representative painting from this period is included in The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. In 1967 while Gottlieb was preparing for the Whitney and Guggenheim Museum exhibition he began to make small models for sculptures out of cut and painted cardboard that, he said, made him feel like ‚Äúa young sculptor, just beginning‚Äù.‚ÄúLouise Bourgeois, Anthony Caro, Christo, Adolph Gottlieb, Lyman Kipp‚Äù Art Now: New York, vol. 1, no. 7, September 1969 These small sculptures evolved into larger works in cut, welded, and painted steel and aluminum. Gottlieb's foray into sculpture lasted only about a year and a half, but in that brief time he created a body of work that challenged the delineation between painting and sculpture. In ways similar to his friend the sculptor David Smith, Gottlieb's background as a painter made it impossible for him to visualize objects without color. Once he accepted this, Gottlieb was compelled to use all the tools he had developed in his long painting career ‚Äì touch, visual balance, surface quality, and more ‚Äì to make his sculptures, like his paintings, become \\"a vehicle for the expression of feeling‚Ä¶ I feel a necessity for making the particular colors that I use, or the particular shapes, carry the burden of everything that I want to express, and all has to be concentrated within these few elements.\\" In all Gottlieb created 42 sculptures, including three large, outdoor pieces that are currently in the collections of The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, The Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, NY, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.Adolph Gottlieb Sculptor, edited by Sanford Hirsch, Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation,2012 pp.2‚Äì13 Gottlieb remained active throughout the 1960s. In 1963 he became the first American artist to be awarded the Gran Premio of the S√£o Paulo Bienale in Brazil. In 1968, the Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum in New York collaborated on a retrospective exhibition of his art that filled both museums. This remains, to date, the only collaborative project between these two major institutions. ==Career highlights== Throughout his career Adolph Gottlieb had 56 solo exhibitions and was included in over 200 group exhibitions. His works of art are in the collections of more than 140 major museums around the world. Gottlieb was accomplished as a painter, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor. He designed and oversaw construction of a 1500 square-foot stained glass fa√ßade for the Milton Steinberg Center in New York City in 1954, and he designed a suite of 18 stained glass windows for the Kingsway Jewish Center in Brooklyn. See also: He was the first of his generation to have his art collected by the Museum of Modern Art (1946) and the Guggenheim Museum (1948). ==Death and legacy== Gottlieb suffered a major stroke in 1970 that left him paralyzed except for his right arm and hand. He continued to paint and to exhibit his art until his death in March 1974. His funeral service was held on Wednesday, March 6, 1974 at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, and he was buried at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY.\\"Deaths,\\" The New York Times, March 5, 1974, p. 36 He was voted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1972. In addition to his contributions as an artist, Gottlieb advocated for professional status for artists throughout his life. He helped to organize ‚ÄúForum 49‚Äù and other artist-led events and symposia in New York and Provincetown in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1950 he was the primary organizer of the protest against the Metropolitan Museum of Art that resulted in him and his colleagues gaining recognition as ‚ÄúThe Irascibles‚Äù. Following directions Gottlieb left in his Will, the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation was formed in 1976, offering grants to visual artists. ==See also== *Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation ==References== ==Sources== * Marika Herskovic, American Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey, (New York School Press, 2003.) . pp. 142‚Äì145 * Marika Herskovic, New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.) . p. 32; p. 37; pp. 158‚Äì161 *ART USA NOW Ed. by Lee Nordness; Vol. 1, (The Viking Press, Inc., 1963.), pp. 118‚Äì121. ==Further reading== *The Pictographs of Adolph Gottlieb, essays by Lawrence Alloway et al.

His grandparents were free at the time of his father's birth. His father joined the Union Army voluntarily at the age of 17. His mother's father escaped from captivity on plantation and later purchased the freedom of his wife and children. ==Education and career== A graduate of Yale University (1895) with a BA, Ferris subsequently took on the role of writer and lecturer. He was a Harvard Divinity School student from 1897‚Äì99, graduating Harvard with an MA in journalism in 1900. After teaching at Tallahassee State College, Florida Baptist College (1900‚Äì01) he worked for a number of newspapers from 1902‚Äì03. He continued teaching during the years 1903-5 at Henderson Normal School and Kittrell College in North Carolina. Ferris became pastor of Christ Congregational Church from 1904 to 1905. In 1908 he wrote a book entitled \\"Typical Negro Traits\\". From 1910 to 1912 he was given charge of the \\"colored\\" missions of A.M.E. Zion Church of Lowell and Salem, Massachusetts as a lecturer at white churches. He went on to write The African Abroad; or his Evolution in Western Civilization: Tracing his development under Caucasian Milieus in 1913. Ferris held positions as Assistant President General of the UNIA-ACL and Associate Editor of the Negro World. ==Activism== He was a participant in the March 5, 1897 meeting to celebrate the memory of Frederick Douglass which founded the American Negro Academy led by Alexander Crummell.Seraile, William. Bruce Grit: The Black Nationalist Writings of John Edward Bruce. Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2003. p110-111 Over the coming decades, Ferris remained active among the scholars, editors, and activists of this first major African American learned society, refuting racist scholarship, promoting black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and studying the history and sociology of African American life.Alfred A. Moss. The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth. Louisiana State University Press, 1981. Ferris worked with William Monroe Trotter and the Boston Guardian, W. E. B. Du Bois and the Niagara Movement, and John Edward Bruce and the Negro Society for Historical Research. At the suggestion of Trotter, Ferris came to Washington in January 1903 and spoke in opposition to the more conservative approach to black rights of Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. As a reply, Richard W. Thompson spoke in front of the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 in support of Washington.The Race's Leader! the Friends of Booker T.

The show originally debuted as a primetime half-hour program on ABC in 1960, featuring three theatrical Looney Tunes cartoons with new linking sequences produced by the Warner Bros. Cartoons staff. After two seasons, The Bugs Bunny Show moved to Saturday mornings, where it remained in one format or another for nearly four decades. The show's title and length changed regularly over the years, as did the network: both ABC and CBS broadcast versions of The Bugs Bunny Show. In 2000, the series, by then known as The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show, was canceled after the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies libraries became the exclusive property of the Cartoon Network family of cable TV networks in the United States. Reruns of The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show were aired on the Canadian channels Teletoon and Teletoon's sister channel, Teletoon Retro (until 2015 when Teletoon Retro signed off). Prior to Teletoon and Teletoon Retro, CBC Television (1960-75) and Global Television Network (1978-82, 1990-2000) aired the show. In Australia, episodes of the show was divided into 3 networks with most episodes aired on Nine Network and some episodes were divided on Network Ten and Seven Network since its debut. ==Broadcast and format history== ===The Bugs Bunny Show in prime time=== The original Bugs Bunny Show debuted on ABC prime time in the United States on October 11, 1960, airing on Tuesdays at 7:30 PM EST, under the sponsorship of General Foods (Post cereals, Tang, etc.). Newly produced linking segments were done for each episode by the Warner Bros. animation staff. Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng produced, directed, and created the storyboards for the earliest of these, with Robert McKimson later taking over the direction while Jones and Freleng continued producing and writing.Maltin, Leonard (1980, rev. 1987). Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons. New York: Plume/Penguin Books. Pg. 274‚Äì275. The wraparounds were produced in color, although the original broadcasts of the show were in black-and-white. A total of 52 episodes were made. The show's theme song was \\"This Is It\\", written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston (\\"Overture/curtain, lights/this is it/the night of nights...\\"). The opening title sequence, animated by Freleng unit animator Gerry Chiniquy,McCorry, Kevin (2007). \\"The Bugs Bunny Show Page.\\" features Bugs and Daffy Duck performing the song in unison. For the final chorus, a lineup of Looney Tunes characters joins Bugs and Daffy onstage (Porky Pig, however, is absent from the procession, although Porky precede a spin-off show based on the original Bugs Bunny Show 4 years later titled The Porky Pig Show which aired on ABC from 1964 to 1967). The Bugs Bunny Show proved beneficial to the Warner Bros. cartoon staff, as it allowed the studio to remain open despite the shrinking market for theatrical animated shorts.Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in its Golden Age. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 562. . The final first-run episode of the original Bugs Bunny Show aired on August 7, 1962,The Bugs Bunny Show: A Tale of Two Kitties ‚Äì TV.com and the Warner Bros. animation studio closed the following spring. ===The move to Saturday mornings, 1962‚Äì1985=== ABC began re-running The Bugs Bunny Show on Saturday mornings in mid-August 1962 until September 1967 when it was moved to Sunday mornings for the remainder of its run. The series was rerun in color beginning in 1965, and remained on ABC until September 1968. At this point, the series switched to CBS, where it was combined with The Road Runner Show (which had aired on CBS since 1966) to create The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour.McCorry, Kevin (2007). \\"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour Page.\\" The standard Bugs Bunny Show opening and the announcer's introduction of Bugs Bunny (\\"that Oscar-winning rabbit!\\") were directly followed by the rabbit's saying, \\"...and also starring my fast feathered friend, the Road Runner\\", after which The Road Runner Show's theme was played. The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour combined re-edited bridging sequences from both shows to link the seven cartoons featured in each episode. The bridging sequences would be edited further in later versions of the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour.Beck, Jerry and Will Friedwald, Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons, Henry Holt, 1989 In 1971, The Road Runner Show moved to ABC, and a reconstituted half-hour Bugs Bunny Show aired on CBS, featuring re-edited versions of the bridging sequences and a different grouping of cartoons. In 1973, The Bugs Bunny Show returned to ABC for two seasons, only for CBS to re-acquire both shows and bring back The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour in 1975. In 1976, Sylvester and Tweety were featured in their own Sylvester and Tweety Show for one year, necessitating the removal of most of the Tweety and/or Sylvester cartoons on Bugs Bunny/Road Runner that season. Also that year, a weekly half-hour prime-time edition of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show briefly aired on CBS' Tuesday night schedule from April through June. The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour became The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show in November 1977 after CBS added another half-hour to the runtime. In 1981, a companion Sylvester & Tweety, Daffy, and Speedy Show was added to the CBS schedule, which included a number of later cartoons produced by a reestablished Warner Bros. Cartoons studio from 1967 to 1969. The following year, this new companion series was canceled, and its cartoons were incorporated into The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show, which was broadcast as two separate hour-long programs on Saturday mornings (for the second program, the show's opening titles were re-animated). In 1983, CBS returned the show to 90 minutes and the bridging sequences were dropped. The following year, the \\"This Is It\\" opening was jettisoned altogether; a new title sequence (created from clips of the cartoons) and new theme song (\\"It's Cartoon Gold\\"), composed by Steve Zuckerman with lyrics by John Klawitter, introduced the show. ===Final Saturday morning years, 1985‚Äì2000=== CBS gave up the rights to broadcast the Warner Bros. cartoons following the 1984‚Äì85 season, and as a result, the show moved back to ABC, where it became The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour. Cartoons featuring Tweety or Speedy Gonzales were not broadcast on ABC during the 1985‚Äì86 season, the latter presumably due to Mexican stereotypes. The following year, however, Tweety cartoons were added to the program, which was reduced to a half-hour and renamed The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show.McCorry, Kevin (2007). \\"The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show Page.\\" Beginning with its third season, The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show was expanded to a full hour, and the original \\"This Is It\\" theme was reintroduced with similar animation as the original, accompanied by the introductory sequence introduced in 1982. Another version of the \\"This Is It\\" opening sequence was done in 1992 with different character animations which contained a more goofy look. Though the program did not qualify for the educational/informational designation, it nonetheless remained on Saturday mornings after the new designation debuted in 1996, one of the few non-E/I programs to survive the rules changes. That same year, ABC was bought by The Walt Disney Company, and The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show was the only non-Disney cartoon to remain on the lineup, due to their contract not being up yet, and was in the first few years of the Disney's One Saturday Morning block starting in 1997 (with the Disney logo omitted from the blocks bumpers during the show). The program was often paired with ABC's in-house Schoolhouse Rock! shorts during this time. The hour-long Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show remained on the air until 1999, when it was again reduced to a half-hour. In 2000, Warner Bros. made the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies film library exclusive to Cartoon Network, which Time Warner owned as part of the purchase of Turner Broadcasting in 1996. As a result, The Bugs Bunny Show ended its four-decade-long network run, one of the longest runs in the history of United States network television. ==Legacy== This show is credited for keeping the Warner Bros. cartoons made during the Golden Age of American animation a part of the American consciousness. Indeed, the show ran for more than four decades, and helped inspire animators, comedians, historians, and others who watched Saturday morning television.\\"Looney Tunes on Television\\", a website dedicated to the Looney Tunes television broadcast history, and maintained by Kevin McCorry and Jon Cooke. The \\"This Is It\\" song's fame is such that it has been used elsewhere such as in the Canadian province of Ontario where it was used in a TV commercial promoting the various performing arts tourist attractions where artists of various disciplines sing separate lines of the song. In \\"The Opera,\\" an episode from the fourth season of the US sitcom Seinfeld, Jerry sings \\"This Is It\\" to Elaine while both characters are waiting outside the theater, causing Elaine to exclaim, \\"You know it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.\\" When Warner Bros. released its video series \\"Golden Jubilee\\", featuring the classic cartoons, the opening sequence shows the Tasmanian Devil maniacally riding a motorcycle down a city street, chased by a police car. He makes a sharp turn into a theater, where the rest of the Looney Tunes are performing to the Bugs Bunny Show tune. == Animated sequences produced for the show == A series of short animated scenes were produced for the show, featured \\"linking\\" moments during the fictional theater setting of the show. These scenes included: * A frustrated Daffy Duck bickering on stage with Bugs Bunny. Daffy declares, \\"Last week you said you were going to introduce me next week!\\" Bugs replies, \\"Right...but this isn't next week, is it?\\" Daffy trips himself up and replies, \\"You're doggone tootin' is isn't! This is this week! And next week is uhhh...ummm...sheesh!\\" * A barking sheepdog wanders into the theater, saying \\"Which way did he go? Where's the little bunny I saw on TV last week?\\" Daffy, at this time, has dressed up in a rabbit costume and is on stage pretending to be Bugs. The sheepdog pounces upon Daffy and exclaims, \\"At last, at last! I have caught a bunny rabbit!\\" * Bugs entertains the audience by playing a guitar. An angry Yosemite Sam barges in the theater shouting, \\"Can't ya see I'm tryin' to sleep?!?\\", snatches the guitar from Bugs, and snaps all of its strings. * Bugs demonstrates some cartoon physics, including slow motion, fast speed and \\"virbrating to a stop.\\" The show's title sequences and some of these linking material scenes from the original Bugs Bunny Show are included as bonus features on each volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD collection (with the exception of Volume 6). As the original color negatives were cut up by CBS and ABC to create later versions of the show, the linking sequences are presented on DVD using a combination of footage from both what's left of the color negatives (some of which were used in later incarnations, thus helping to preserve them) and the black-and-white ABC broadcast prints prepared in the early 1960s. On the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, the opening to the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show (with the announcer calling it the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour) and two openings to the Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show (the 1988 opening and the 1992 opening) were released as special features. In 2009, an episode of the Bugs Bunny Show was released on the Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Volume 2 set. Saturday Morning Cartoons 1970s Volume 2 includes an episode of the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show. ==Formats== Prime Time: * The Bugs Bunny Show, October 11, 1960 ‚Äì August 7, 1962 (ABC) Saturday Mornings: * The Bugs Bunny Show, Mid/late august/September 8, 1968 (in color starting September 10, 1966) (ABC) * The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour, September 14, 1968 ‚Äì September 4, 1971 (CBS) * The Bugs Bunny Show, September 11, 1971 ‚Äì September 1, 1973 (CBS) * The Bugs Bunny Show, September 8, 1973 - August 30, 1975 (ABC) * The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour, September 6, 1975 ‚Äì November 12, 1977 (CBS) * The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show, November 19, 1977 ‚Äì September 7, 1985 (CBS) * The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour, September 7, 1985 ‚Äì September 6, 1986 (ABC) * The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show, September 13, 1986 ‚Äì September 2, 2000 (ABC) ==Credits== * Senior Directors: Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson * Co-Directors: Hawley Pratt, Gerry Chiniquy, Art Davis, Abe Levitow, Maurice Noble, Alex Lovy, David Detiege, Rudy Larriva, Tom Ray * Stories, Animation, layouts, and backgrounds: Members of Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Local 839 * Voices: Mel Blanc, June Foray, Arthur Q.

The first three are indexed to inflation. The last one is typically indexed to a foreign currency, mainly the US dollar. Any of these different types of indexation can be reversed (deindexation). Applying a cost-of-living escalation COLA clause to a stream of periodic payments protects the real value of those payments and effectively transfers the risk of inflation from the payee to the payor, who must pay more each year to reflect the increases in prices. Thus, inflation indexation is often applied to pension payments, rents and other situations which are not subject to regular re-pricing in the market. COLA is not CPI, which is an aggregate indicator. Using CPI as a COLA salary adjustment for taxable income fails to recognize that increases are generally taxed at the highest marginal tax rate whereas an individual's rising costs are paid with after-tax dollars - dollars commensurate with an individual's average after-tax level. Indexing tax brackets does not address this fundamental issue but it does effectively eliminate \\"bracket-creep\\". Indexation has been very important in high- inflation environments, and was known as monetary correction \\"\\" in Brazil from 1964 to 1994. Some countries have cut back significantly in the use of indexation and cost-of-living escalation clauses, first by applying only partial protection for price increases and eventually eliminating such protection altogether when inflation is brought down to single digits. Protecting one of the parties from the risk of inflation means that the price risk must be shifted to another party. For example, if state pensions are adjusted for inflation, the price risk is passed from the pensioners to the taxpayers. ==Wages== When a government decides to index wages of government employees to inflation it is to transfer the risk of inflation away from government workers onto the government. Such a policy is to attempt to reduce inflationary expectation and in turn inflation when it is rising rapidly. Research by economists is ambivalent on the success of such policies. Some have deemed it a success including Friedman (1974), Gray (1976), and Fischer (1977). Others have considered it less successful as they observed that indexation breeds inflation inertia (a reduction in the government and the central bank‚Äôs effort in fighting inflation leading to inflation rate remaining higher than targeted). This perspective is supported by Bonomo and Garcia (1994). The economists diverging opinions on the merit of indexation often depend on what data they looked at. A given country over a specific time series may have been successful conducting indexation. While another country at another time may have been less successful. Some economists believe there are appropriate times for indexation (when inflation is really high) and times for deindexation (when inflation has moderated after indexation, but remains still too high vs the central bank‚Äôs inflation target). In recent years Brazil, Chile, Israel, and Mexico have implemented successful inflation fighting campaigns by implementing the deindexation of wages (Lefort and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2002). ==Debt== The indexation of government debt to inflation is related to transferring the inflation risk from depositors to the government in an attempt to reduce inflation. Some governments have ultimately subjected their short-term debt instruments to deindexation so their central bank could regain control of short-term interest rates from a monetary policy standpoint and be in a better position to fight inflation. Another objective of indexation, for certain governments with already low inflation rate, is to reduce their borrowing cost by paying lower interest rates to depositors in exchange for assuming inflation risk. Both the UK and the US have issued inflation indexed government bonds to reduce their borrowing costs. When governments such as the UK and the US issue both inflation indexed bonds and regular nominal bonds, it gives them precise information on inflation expectation by observing the difference in yields between the two types of bonds. Robert Shiller has done extensive research on all mentioned aspects of government bond indexation. ==Tax rate== The indexation of tax rate is to avoid an increase in effective and marginal tax rates due to inflation pushing taxpayers taxable income into higher tax brackets even though their pre tax purchasing power has not changed. Tax codes of various countries can be very complicated. As a result, certain types of taxes may be partially or entirely subject to deindexation even though the main tax rate structure is not. This is the case in the US where the standard tax rate is indexed to inflation. But, its parallel Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) code is not. As a result, a rising share of the taxpayers‚Äô population is anticipated to become liable under the AMT which was originally implemented to tax only the very rich.(On January 2, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which indexes to inflation the income thresholds for being subject to the tax.[1]) In Canada, a recent reduction in tax rate was in part countered by a partial deindexation of certain credits (the credits were adjusted upward by the inflation rate ‚Äì 3%). ==Currency== The indexation of currency or exchange rate often refers to a country pegging its currency to the US dollar. In other words, such a country‚Äôs central bank would buy or sell dollars so as to maintain a stable exchange rate with the dollar. Such a policy has been adopted by several Asian countries including China. If not for the mentioned pegging, the currencies of these countries would rise against the dollar as a result of the US chronic current account deficit with such countries. But, the Asian countries have a vested economic interest in keeping US demand for their exports high. That‚Äôs where the pegging of their currency to the US dollar comes in. Often the pegging conducted by central banks is pretty discrete and not disclosed in any formal policy statement. The pegging also can be pretty elastic. A central bank will maintain an exchange rate within a deemed acceptable range instead of at a specific level. Over time, the acceptable range may broaden or narrow depending on such a country‚Äôs economy overall reliance on exports to fuel growth. Thus, it is challenging to clearly observe the deindexation of a currency. == See also == * Index (economics) == Sources == * Indexation, Inflation, and Monetary Policy: An Overview by Fernando Lefort and Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel Category:Financial economics Category:Price indices Category:Inflation Category:International macroeconomics ","title":"Indexation"},{"id":"1298636","text":"Samuel \\"Sam\\" Berger, (January 1, 1900 - July 24, 1992) was a Canadian owner of the Canadian Football League's Ottawa Rough Riders and Montreal Alouettes and president of the CFL. ==Life== A lawyer by profession, he was an early football fan who became involved with the Ottawa Rough Riders team as its legal advisor, president, and as an owner.

His subsequent life of prayer and service earned him the affectionate title \\"saint of Urakami,\\" and he has subsequently been honoured with the title of Servant of God, the first step towards Catholic sainthood. ==Early years== Takashi (meaning \\"nobility\\") Nagai had a difficult birth that endangered his and his mother's life. His family was highly educated. His father, Noboru Nagai, was trained in Western medicine; his paternal grandfather, Fumitaka Nagai, was a practitioner of traditional herbal medicine; and his mother, Tsune, was the descendant of an old family of samurai.Glynn, Paul (2009). A Song for Nagasaki. San Francisco: Ignatius Press. pp. 14‚Äì17, 185, 199; . Nagai was raised in the rural area of Mitoya and raised in according to the teachings of Confucius and the Shinto religion. In 1920, he commenced his secondary studies at Matsue High School boarding at his cousins' home close by. He became increasingly interested with the surrounding atheism but was curious about Christianity.Ê∞∏‰∫ïÈöÜÂçöÂ£´„ÅåÊóßÂà∂ÊùæÊ±üÈ´òÊ†°ÊôÇ‰ª£„ÅÆÊÅ©Â∏´„Å´„ÅÇ„Å¶„ÅüÁõ¥Á≠Ü„Éè„Ç¨„Ç≠„ÇíÂ±ïÁ§∫ 2011Âπ¥12Êúà12Êó• Â≥∂Ê†πÂ§ßÂ≠¶ Dr Nagai's handwritten postcard to his teacher at Matsue High School displayed at Shimane University, shimane-u.ac.jp, 12 December 2011. ==Life in Nagasaki== In April 1928, he joined the Nagasaki Medical CollegeMakoto, Nagai (2000).

San Paolo, 1961, p. 21, 59, 61, 342, 349-50, 355-58, 361; In 1930 his mother died from a brain haemorrhage, which lead him to ponder the works of philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal. He began to read the Pens√©es which influenced his later conversion to Christianity and boarded with the Moriyama family, who for seven generations had been the hereditary leaders of a group of Kakure Kirishitans in Urakami. Takashi learned that the construction of the nearby cathedral was financed by poor Christian farmers and fishermen. He graduated in 1932 and was supposed to deliver an address at the ceremony. However, five days before he became intoxicated at a farewell party and had returned home completely soaked with water from the rain. He slept without drying himself and found the next morning that he had contracted a disease of the right ear (signs of meningitis), which made him depressed and partially deaf. He could not practice medicine and agreed to turn to radiology research. On 24 December, Sadakichi Moriyama invited Nagai to participate in a midnight Mass. In the cathedral, Takashi was impressed by the people in prayer, their singing, their faith and the sermon. He would later say: \\"I felt somebody close to me whom I did not still know.\\" The next night, Sadakichi's daughter Midori was struck down by acute appendicitis. Nagai made a quick diagnosis, telephoned the surgeon at the hospital and carried Midori there on his back through the snow. The operation was successful; Midori survived. In January 1933, Takashi began his military service. In Manchuria, Nagai cared for the wounded and the sanitary service. He was strongly shaken in his faith in Japanese culture when saw for himself the exactions of the Japanese soldiers and their brutality towards the Chinese civilian population. Upon his return, he continued his reading of the Catholic catechism, the Bible, and the Pens√©es of Blaise Pascal. He met with a priest, Father Matsusaburo Moriyama, whose father had been deported to Tsuwano (Shimane Prefecture) for his faith, along with many other Christian villagers in Urakami by the Meiji Government from the 1860s to the 1870s (Urakami Yoban Kuzure). Eventually, Nagai's spiritual progress took a decisive turn when he thought about Pascal's words: \\"There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition.\\" ==Conversion to Catholicism== On 9 June 1934, Nagai received baptism in the Catholic faith. He chose the Christian first name Paul and proposed to Midori. They married in August and had four children: a boy, Makoto (3 April 1935 ‚Äì 4 April 2001), and three daughters, Ikuko (7 July 1937 ‚Äì 1939), Sasano who died shortly after her birth, and Kayano (18 August 1941 ‚Äì 2 February 2008). Takashi received the sacrament of confirmation in December 1934. Midori was president of the association of the women of the Urakami district. Takashi became a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SSVDP), discovered its founder, Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam, and his writings, and visited his patients and the poor, to whom he brought assistance, comfort and food. From 1931 to 1936, Father Maximilian Kolbe lived in a suburb of Nagasaki, where he started a monastery. Takashi met him several times. ==Sino- Japanese War== The day after the birth of his first daughter Ikuko, the war between Japan and China broke out and he was mobilized as surgeon in the service of the 5th division. He was affected by the harsh winter in China, and the distress of the civilians and soldiers, both Chinese and Japanese. On 4 February 1939, he received news of the death of his father and that of his daughter Ikuko. He remained in China until 1940. Upon his return, he continued his studies at the college. ==World War II== After Japan declared war on the United States on 8 December 1941, Nagai had a somber presentiment: His city could be destroyed during this war. He obtained his doctorate in 1944. On 26 April 1945, an air raid on Nagasaki left numerous victims. The hospital was overwhelmed. Takashi spent his days and nights serving the wounded in his radiology department. In June 1945, he was diagnosed with leukemia and given a life expectancy of three years. This disease was probably due to his exposure to X-rays during radiological examinations which he performed by direct observation, since films were not available during the war period. He spoke to Midori about his disease, and she said to Nagai, \\"Whether you live or die, it is for God's glory.\\" In the evening of 6 August, Nagai learned that an atomic bomb had been dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima. With Midori, he decided to take their children away to Matsuyama, 6 km away in the countryside, accompanied by Midori's mother. ==Relief activities== On 9 August 1945, at 11:02 am, the second atomic bomb struck Nagasaki. At the time of the atomic bombing, Dr. Nagai was working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in dedicating themselves to treating the atomic bomb victims. He wrote a 100-page medical report about his observations detailing the \\"concentric circles of death\\" around the epicentre of the blast. On 11 August, he found his house destroyed and his wife dead. Months later, Nagai was found to be seriously affected by his head wound. He was confined to bed for a month, with death for a time seeming close as he began suffering from Cheyne-Stokes respiration. According to Nagai, when he drank water taken from Lourdes in Honkawachi, where Fr. Kolbe had founded a monastery, he heard a voice urge him to ask an intercession from the priest.Nagai, Takashi (1989). „É´„É´„Éâ„ÅÆÂ•áË∑° (The Miracle of Lourdes). ÂéüÂ≠êÈáéÈå≤Èü≥ (Genshiya Rokuon), p. 37. Seibo no Kishisha; ==Postwar years== He returned to the district of Urakami (the epicenter of the bomb) on 15 October 1945 and built a small hut (about six tatami from pieces of his old house. He remained there with his two surviving children (Makoto and Kayano), his mother-in-law, and two other relatives. In 1947, the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SSVDP) built a simple two-tatami teahouse-like structure for him. Nagai named it \\"Nyokodo\\" (Â¶ÇÂ∑±Â†Ç, Nyoko-d≈ç to, literally \\"As- Yourself Hall\\", after Jesus' words, \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\" He styled it as a hermitage and spent his remaining years in prayer and contemplation.Nagai, Takashi (2008).

Nyoko-do Hermitage, Nagasaki For six months, he observed mourning for Midori and let his beard and hair grow. On 23 November 1945, a mass was celebrated, in front of the ruins of the cathedral, for the victims of the bomb. Takashi gave a speech filled with faith, comparing the victims to a sacred offering to obtain peace. In the following years, Nagai resumed teaching and began to write books. The first of these, The Bells of Nagasaki, was completed by the first anniversary of the bombing. Although he failed to find a publisher at first, eventually it became a best seller and the basis for a top box-office movie in Japan. In July 1946, he collapsed on a station platform. Now disabled, he was henceforth confined to bed. In 1948, he used 50,000 yen paid by Kyushu Times to plant 1,000 three-year-old sakura (cherry) trees in the district of Urakami to transform this devastated land into a \\"Hill of Flowers\\". Although some have been replaced, these cherry trees are still called \\"Nagai Senbonzakura\\" (\\"1,000 cherry trees of Nagai\\"); their flowers decorate the houses of Urakami in spring. By 2010, the numbers of these cherry trees were reduced to only about 20 due to aging and other causes.Yu Kawakami Young cherry trees grown from trees planted by Nagasaki A-bomb survivor, Hiroshima Peace Media Center, 22 December 2010. On 3 December 1949, he was made freeman of the city of Nagasaki.Honorary Citizens. Nagasaki City) He received a visit from Helen Keller in October 1948. He was visited, in 1949, by Emperor Hirohito and by Cardinal Gilroy of Australia, a papal emissary. ==Death== On 1 May 1951, he asked to be transported to the college hospital so that the medical students could observe the last moments of a man preparing to die from leukemia. He prolonged the day of hospitalization to wait for the statue of Our Lady, a gift from the Italian Catholic Medical Association. Until the evening, his condition seemed stable. However, around 9:40pm, Nagai complained of dizziness and became unconscious. After two injections of cardiotonics, he regained his consciousness and prayed \\"Jesus, Mary, Joseph, into your hands, I entrust my soul.\\" Then he took the cross from the hand of his son Makoto, who rushed into the room, and shortly after he shouted the words \\"Please pray!\\" Nagai breathed his last at 9:50 pm. He died at the age of 43. On the following day, his body underwent an autopsy at the hospital according to his will. His spleen had swelled to 3,410g (normal weight: 94g), and his liver weighed 5,035g (normal weight: 1,400g). On 3 May, his funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop Paul Aijir≈ç Yamaguchi in front of the cathedral. On 14 May, an official ceremony took place in memory of Nagai. An estimated 20,000 attended. The city of Nagasaki observed one minute of silence while the bells of all the religious buildings rang. His remains were interred in the Sakamoto international cemetery. ==Legacy== His \\"Nyokodo\\", with the addition of a library, became a museum in 1952: the Nagasaki City Nagai Takashi Memorial Museum. After undergoing restoration in 2000, it is managed today by Tokusaburo Nagai, the grandson of Takashi Nagai and son of Makoto Nagai.

These enjoyed a large readership during the American occupation of Japan (1945‚Äì52) as spiritual chronicles of the atomic bomb experience. His books have been translated into languages, including Chinese, Korean, French, and German. Three of his literary works are currently available in English: We of Nagasaki, a compilation of atomic-bomb victim testimonies edited by Nagai; The Bells of Nagasaki (trans. William Johnston); and Leaving My Beloved Children Behind (trans. Maurice M. Tatsuoka and Tsuneyoshi Takai). His works were recently republished in new Japanese editions by Paulist Press. Much of Nagai's writing is spiritual, consisting of Christian reflections on the experience (or, just as often, imagined future experience) of himself and the people around him, especially his children, in the aftermath of the war. His intensely personal meditations are often addressed to his children or to God, and he works out his own spiritual issues on the page as he writes in a visceral and uncensored prose.

Along with his three younger brothers (Albert, Sam and Jack) Warner played a crucial role in the film business and played a key role in establishing Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc, serving as the company president until 1956. == Early life == Warner was born Hirsz Moj≈ºesz \\"Wonsal\\" or \\"Wonskolaser\\" to a family of Polish Jewshttps://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&context;=vocesnovae from the village of Krasnosielc, Congress Poland, Russian Empire (now Poland).Doug Sinclair, \\"The Family of Benjamin and Pearl Leah (Eichelbaum) Warner: Early Primary Records,\\" (2008), published at Doug Sinclair's Archives Walter L. Hixson, The American Experience in World War II. Quote: \\"Harry and Jack Warner were the sons of Polish Jews who had earlier fled their homeland to escape persecution\\"Michael E. Birdwell, in Celluloid Soldiers, speaks of his background: \\"Harry was a Polish-Jewish immigrant\\" in America (page 59, last paragraph). He was the son of Benjamin Wonsal, a shoemaker born in Krasnosielc, and Pearl Leah Eichelbaum. His given name was Moj≈ºesz (Moses), however, he was called Hirsz (Anglicized to Hirsch) in the United States. In October 1889, he came to Baltimore, Maryland with his mother and siblings on the steamship Hermann from Bremen, Germany. Their father had preceded them, immigrating to Baltimore in 1888 in order to pursue his trade in shoes and shoe repair. It was at that time that he changed the family name to Warner which was used thereafter. As in many Jewish immigrant families, some of the children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names. Hirsz became Harry, and his middle name Morris was likely a version of Moj≈ºesz. In Baltimore, the money Benjamin Warner earned in the shoe repair business was not enough to provide for his growing household. He and Pearl had another daughter, Fannie, not long after they arrived. Benjamin moved the family to Canada, inspired by a friend's advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Sons Jacob and David Warner were born in London, Ontario.Sinclair (2008), citing the 1910 US census. After two arduous years in Canada, the Warners returned to Baltimore.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 23‚Äì24. Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.Sinclair (2008), citing the 1900 and 1910 US censuses. In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry, who had established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 24‚Äì25. Benjamin worked with Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city's downtown area.Thomas (1990), pp. 12‚Äì13.Thomas (1990), p. 12. In 1899, Harry opened a bicycle shop in Youngstown, Ohio with his brother, Abraham. Eventually, Harry and Abe also opened a bowling alley together. The bowling alley failed and closed shortly after it opened. Harry eventually accepted an offer to become a salesman for a local meat franchise, and sold meat in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. However, by his nineteenth birthday, Harry was reduced to living in his parents' crowded household. == Business career in films == In 1903, Harry's brothers, Abe and Sam, began to exhibit The Great Train Robbery at carnivals across Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1905, Harry sold his bicycle shop and joined his brothers in their fledgling film business. With the money Harry made from selling the bicycle shop, the three brothers were able to purchase a building in New Castle, Pennsylvania. They would use this building to establish their first theater, the Cascade. The Cascade was so successful that the brothers were able to purchase a second theater in New Castle. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. In 1907, the Warners expanded the business further and purchased fifteen theaters in Pennsylvania. Harry, Sam, and Albert then formed a new film exchange company, The Duquesne Amusement Supply Company, and rented an office in the Bakewell building in downtown Pittsburgh. Harry sent Sam to New York to purchase, and ship, films for their Pittsburgh exchange company, while he and Albert remained in Pittsburgh to run the business. In 1909, the brothers sold the Cascade Theater and established a second film exchange company in Norfolk, Virginia. Harry agreed to let younger brother Jack be a part of the company, sending him to Norfolk to serve as Sam's assistant. A serious problem threatened the Warners' film company with the advent of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1910, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for \\"$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000\\". After they sold their business, Harry and his three brothers joined forces with independent filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, and began distributing films from his Pittsburgh film exchange division. In 1912, the brothers earned a $1,500 profit with the film Dante's Inferno. In the wake of this success, Harry and the brothers broke with Laemmle and established their own film production company. They named their new company Warner Features. Once Warner Features was established, Harry acquired an office in New York with his brother Albert, sending Sam and Jack to run the new corporation's film exchange divisions in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1917, Harry won more capital for the studio when he was able to negotiate a deal with Ambassador James W. Gerard to make Gerard's book My Four Years In Germany into a film. In 1918, after the success of My Four Years In Germany, the brothers were able to establish a studio near Hollywood, California. In the new Hollywood studio, Sam became co-head of production along with his younger brother, Jack. They were convinced that they would have to make movies themselves if they were to ever generate a profit. Between the years 1919 and 1920, the studio did not turn a profit. During this time, banker Motley Flint, who was, unlike most bankers at the time, not anti-semitic, helped the brothers pay off their debts. The four brothers then decided to relocate their studio from Culver City, California to the Sunset Boulevard section of Hollywood. During this time, Warner decided to focus on making only dramas for the studio. The studio rebounded in 1921 with the success of the studio's film Why Girls Leave Home; The film's director, Harry Rapf, became the studio's new head producer. On April 4, 1923, following the success of the studio's film The Gold Diggers, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established, with help from a loan given to Harry by Montly Flint. Harry became company president, with Albert as treasurer and Jack and Sam as co-heads of production. Harry and his family moved to Hollywood. === Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. === The studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his starring debut in Where the North Begins, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper. According to one biographer, Jack Warner's initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, \\"who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.\\" The trained dog proved to be the studio's most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound. Prolific screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio's features. Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as the studio's executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films; while Warner's younger brother Jack and Zanuck were able to obtain a close friendship, Warner never really accepted Zanuck as a friend. After establishing Warner Bros., the studio had unfortunately overdrawn $1 million (the amount which Warner had loaned from Flint) and Warner decided to pay off the debt by expanding the studio's operations further. In the process, Warner acquired forty theaters in the state of Pennsylvania. In 1924, Warner Bros. would produce two more successful films, The Marriage Circle and Beau Brummell. In 1924, after Rapf departed the studio to accept an offer at MGM, Ernst Lubitsch, the successful director of The Marriage Circle, was also given the title of head producer; Lubitsch would add additional success for the studio's profits. The film Beau Brummel also made John Barrymore a top star at the studio as well. Despite the success the studio now, the brothers were still unable to compete with The Big Three (Paramount, Universal, and First National). In 1925, Harry and a large group of independent film-makers assembled in Milwaukee to challenge the monopoly the Big Three had over the film industry. Harry and the other independent film-makers at the Milwaukee convention agreed to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertisements; this action would help benefit Warner Bros. profits. With help from a loan supplied by Goldman, Sachs head banker Waddill Catchings, Warner would find a way to successfully respond to the growing concern the Big Three Studios further induced to Warner Bros., and expanded the company's operations further by purchasing the Brooklyn theater company Vitagraph. Because of this, Warner Pictures now owned theaters in the New York area. Around this time, Warner purchased a home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hancock Park, where he remained until 1929. In the later part of 1925, Harry's younger brother Sam had also acquired a radio station, KWBC. After acquiring his radio station, Sam decided to make an attempt to use synchronized sound in future Warner Bros. Pictures. Harry had initial reservations about the idea; when Sam first made this suggestion, Harry wanted to focus on background music before delving into people talking on screen. Harry responded, \\"We could ultimately develop sound to the point where people ask for talking pictures\\" The company also began acquiring theaters. Eventually, Warner Bros. came to own and operate some 250 theaters. By February 1926, however, the brothers' radio business had failed, and the studio was facing a net loss of $333,413.00. After a long period of refusing to accept the usage of sound in the company's films, Warner now agreed to use synchronized sound in Warner Bros. shorts, as long as it was used only for background music, Harry then made a visit to Western Electric's Bell Laboratories in New York, (which younger brother Sam had earlier visited) and was impressed. One problem that occurred for the Warners, though, was the fact that the high-ups at Western Electric were anti-Semitic. Sam, though, was able to convince the high-ups to sign with the studio after his wife Lina wore a gold cross at a dinner he attended with Western Electric brass. After this, Harry signed a partnership agreement with Western Electric to use Bell Laboratories to test the sound-on-film process. === Godfather of Talkies === The success of Warner Bros.' early talkie films (The Jazz Singer, The Lights of New York, The Singing Fool and The Terror) catapulted the studio into the ranks of the major studios. Flush with cash, the Warners abandoned their old location in the Poverty Row section of Hollywood and acquired a big studio in Burbank, California. As a result of this success, Warner was able to acquire the Stanley Company of America (founded by Jules E. Mastbaum), which controlled most of the first-run theaters on the East Coast. This purchase gave them a share in rival First National Pictures, of which Stanley owned one-third. After this purchase, Warner was soon able to acquire William Fox‚Äôs one third remaining share in First National and was now officially the majority stockholder of the company. After success of the studio's 1929 First National film Noah's Ark, Harry Warner also agreed to make Michael Curtiz a major director at the Burbank studio as well. Warner, after purchasing a string of music publishers, was even able to establish a music subsidiary- Warner Bros. Music- and buy out additional radio companies, foreign sound patents, and a lithograph company as well; he even was able to produce a Broadway musical Fifty Million Frenchmen. By the time the 1st Academy Awards took place, Warner was recognized as the second most powerful figure in the movie industry, just behind MGM head Nicholas Schenck. In the wake of the success of Gold Diggers of Broadway, journalists had dubbed Warner \\"the godfather of the talking screen.\\" The studio's net profit was now over $14,000,000.00. During this time, Warner soon also grew tired of the Hollywood atmosphere and acquired a twenty-two acre ranch in Mount Vernon, New York. Once Warner returned to New York, he and Albert found work together once again. The Great Depression Following Albert's advice, Jack and Harry Warner acquired three Paramount stars (William Powell, Kay Francis and Ruth Chatterton) for salaries doubled from their previous ones. This move proved to be a success, and stockholders maintained confidence in the Warners. The first year of the Great Depression, 1930, did not damage the studio badly, and Warner was even able to acquire more theaters for the studio in Atlantic City. During this time, Warner was also engaged in a lawsuit with a Boston stockholder who accused him of trying use money from the studio's profitable businesses to try to purchase his vast 300 shares of stock about declare monopoly. The company would, however, suffer a minor financial blow during the year after Motley Flint, the longtime banker for the studio, and by now also a close friend of the Warners, was murdered by an angry investor. In the latter part of 1929, much to Harry's dismay, younger brother Jack would hire sixty- one-year-old actor George Arliss to star in the studio's film Disraeli. To Warner's surprise, the film Disraeli would go to be a success at the box office, and Warner was convinced to make Arliss a top star for the studio as well. During the Depression era, the studio also produced a series of gangster films; Warner Bros. soon became known as \\"gangster studio.\\" The studio's first gangster film Little Caesar was a great success at the box office. Following Little Caesar, the studio agreed to cast Edward Robinson in a wave of gangster pictures. The studio's second gangster film, The Public Enemy, would also make James Cagney arguably the studio's new top star, and the Warners were now further convinced to make more gangster films as well. Another gangster film the studio released during the Depression era was the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. The film made Paul Muni a top studio star, and also got audiences in the United States to question the legal system as well. However, they would begin to feel the effects of the Depression in 1931. As ticket prices became unaffordable, the studio would lose money. By the end of 1931, the studio suffered a net loss of reportedly $8,000,000.00, During this time, Warner rented the Teddington Studio in London, England. To help fight off the financial problems the Depression gave the studio, Warner Bros was now focused on making films for the London market and Irving Asher was appointed as the Teddington Studio's head producer. Unfortunately, the Teddington studio could not bring in additional profit to the Warners, and the Burbank studio would lose an additional $14,000,000 in 1932 as well. In 1934, Warner officially bought out the struggling Teddington Studio. However, relief would also come for the studio after Franklin Roosevelt became US President in 1933 and the New Deal revived the US Economy. Movie tickets became affordable once again. During the year, the studio was able to make a very profitable musical, 42nd Street. which revived the studio's musical films. However, in 1933, a blow would also occur as the studio's longtime head producer Darryl F. Zanuck would quit, because: (1) Harry was strongly against allowing his film Baby Face to step outside the Hays Code boundaries; and 2) the studio reduced his salary as a result of the financial woes the studio temporarily faced from President Roosevelt's bank holiday, and Harry still refused to raise his salary in the wake of the New Deal's economic rebound. Following Zanuck's resignation, studio director Hal B. Wallis took his place as the studio's executive producer, and Harry‚Äîwho, along with his brother Jack, was a notable \\"penny-pincher\\"‚Äî finally agreed to bring salaries back up to government expectations once again. In 1933, the studio was also able to bring newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan films into the Warner Bros. fold. Hearst had previously been signed with MGM, but he ended his ties with the company after a dispute with the company's head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Marion Davies; Davies was a longtime mistress of Hearst, and was now struggling to draw box office success. Through the studio's partnership with Hearst, Harry's younger brother Jack was also able to sign Davies to a studio contract as well. However, Hearst's company and Davies' films could not increase the studio's net profits. In 1934, the studio had a net loss of over $2,500,000. $500,000 of this loss was the result of physical damage to the Warner Bros. Burbank studio that occurred after a massive fire that broke out in the studio around the end of 1934, and destroyed twenty years' worth of early Warner Bros. films. The following year, Hearst's film adaption of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream would fail at the box office and the studio's net loss increased. During this time, Warner was also indicted, along with six other Hollywood studio figures who owned movie theaters, of conspiracy to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, through an attempt to gain a monopoly over theaters in the St. Louis area. In 1935, Warner, along with executives at RKO and Paramount, were put on trial for this charge. After a mistrial occurred, Warner sold the company's movie theaters, at least for a short time, and the case was never reopened. One problem that remained for Warner, however, was the studio's projectionist labor union, which was now controlled by the Mafia. In 1935, the studio's revived musicals would also suffer a major blow after director Busby Berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk one night. During the studio's union crisis, Warner received a threatening phone call from a union member, stating that he would seize Warner's daughter Betty and adopted daughter Lita within a forty-eight-hour period. Warner then agreed to accept the union's demands, and the kidnapping threat ended. However, 1935 also saw some relief for Harry as the studio rebounded with a year-end net profit of $674,158.00. Around this time, a depressed Warner‚Äîseeing that the newly rebounded Warner studio no longer needed loans to pay off debts‚Äîdecided to move to California, and acquired of ranch land just northwest of Hollywood in Calabasas, California. He later moved into a 1,100-acre ranch in the San Fernando Valley. During 1936, the studio's film The Story of Louis Pasteur was a success at the box office. In addition to the film's box office success, Paul Muni won the Oscar for Best Actor in March 1937 for his performance as the title role. The studio's film The Life of Emile Zola (1937) gave the studio its first Oscar for Best Picture. == World War II == Warner occupied a central place in the Hollywood-Washington wartime propaganda effort during the Second World War, and by the end of 1942, served as a frequent, anti-Axis spokesman for the movie industry. Despite his conservative viewpoint and longtime affiliation with the Republican Party, Warner was also a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and supported him during the early 1930s. During Roosevelt's fight for the Democratic nomination in early 1932, the Warners made an effort to make his name known throughout the state of California. After Roosevelt was nominated, the three brothers asked their friends to contribute to his campaign. Jack Warner even staged a \\"Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant\\" at L.A. Stadium Franklin Roosevelt's honor in 1932. During Roosevelt's 1932 campaign, Warner and the studio also contributed $10,000.00 to the Democratic National Committee. In the wake of Nazi Germany's rise to power, Warner became a key proponent of US intervention in Europe. Prior to the beginning of the war in Europe, Warner had produced a series of film shorts which glorified America's fight against Germany during World War I; Warner later received an honorary award for producing these shorts. By the fall of 1938, Warner had gradually helped block the distribution of Warner Bros. films in Nazi Germany and its ally Italy. Prior to the war's beginning in Europe, Warner supervised the production of two anti-German feature films, The Life of Emile Zola (1937) and Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939). He spent large sums of money to get many of his relatives and employees out of Germany when the war officially began in the latter part of 1939. Before the U.S. officially entered World War II, Warner supervised the production of three more anti-German films: The Sea Hawk (1940), which mirrored Spain's King Phillip II as an equivalent to Adolf Hitler, Sergeant York (1941) and You're in the Army Now (1941). After America's entry into the war, Warner decided to focus on making just war films. Among the war films Warner made during the duration of the war were Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy, This Is the Army and the controversial film Mission to Moscow. At the premieres of Yankee Doodle Dandy (in Los Angeles, New York and London), audiences for the film would purchase an altogether total of $15,600,000.00 in war bonds for the governments of England and the United States. By the middle of 1943, however, it became clear that audiences were tired of war films. Despite the growing pressure to abandon production of war films, Warner continued to produce them, losing money in the process. Eventually, in honor of studio contributions to the war cause, the United States Government would name a Liberty Ship after the brothers' father, Benjamin Warner, and Warner would be the one who was given the honor to christen the ship during its first voyage. By the time the war ended, $20,000,000.00 worth of war bonds would be purchased through the studio, the Red Cross collected 5,200 pints of plasma from studio employees, with 763 of the studio's employees, as well as Warner's son-in-law Milton Sperling and nephew Jack Warner Jr., would be recognized with having the honor of having served as in the armed forces. Following a dispute over ownership of Casablanca's Oscar for Best Picture, head producer Hal B. Wallis broke with Warner and resigned from the studio. Following Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart became arguably the studio's top star. In 1943, Olivia de Havilland (whom Warner was now loaning to different companies) sued Jack Warner for breach of contract. de Havilland cited that the government laws only required employee contracts to reach a maximum of seven years; de Havilland had been employed under her studio contract since won her case, and many of the studio's longtime actors were now free of their contracts. To help keep these actors at the studio, Harry now decided to give up the studio's suspension policy. == Postwar era == In 1947, Warner, who was by now exhausted from all his years of arguing with his brother Jack, decided to spend more time at his San Fernando Valley ranch and to expand his interest in horse racing. Along with brother Jack, in 1938, Harry Warner became one of the founders of Hollywood Park Racetrack. In partnership with Mervyn Le Roy, he created the W-L Ranch Co. Thoroughbred racing stable. In 1947, the Warner- LeRoy stable was able to acquire a valuable racehorse named \\"Stepfather.\\" Warner had a bitter rivalry with his brother Jack over the years, particularly due to Jack's longtime infidelities (as Jack had been engaged in affairs with a wide range of various women since Warner Bros. Inc. was established in 1923) and waste of the Burbank studio's money. In the 1930s Harry, like most of his relatives, also refused to accept Jack's second wife, actress Ann Paige - with whom Jack had an affair while still married to his first wife Irma Solomon - as a member of the Warner clan. When Jack and Ann officially got married in January 1936, Harry and the rest of the Warner family refused to attend the ceremony. In a letter Harry sent to Jack on his wedding day to Ann, Harry stated \\"the only thing that could come from this day was that our parents didn't live to see this.\\" Throughout the early years of the studio's existence, various people, including Warner's younger brother Sam, had served as buffers between Harry and Jack. The last person to serve as a buffer between the two, father Benjamin Warner, died on November 5, 1935. Following Benjamin's death, Jack and Harry were now barely on speaking terms, and were merely just business partners to one another. Jack's marriage to Ann was also arguably a huge turning point in the two brothers' fragile relationship as well; Harry's arguments with Jack were now practically on a daily basis. By the early 1950s, the brothers' long-simmering feud had risen to new heights, as Jack began spending a lot of his time in France, occasionally ignored managing the studio in favor of vacationing, gambling, and socializing with royalty, and spent studio money lavishly on 3-D films. On one occasion during this period, studio employees claimed they saw Warner chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting \\"I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch\\". The studio prospered post-war time, and by 1946, company payroll had reached $600,000 a week for studio employees, and the studio's net profit would reach $19,424,650.00 by the end of the year as well. During this time, Warner hired his son-in-law, Milton Sperling, to head an independent film production company for the studio. In 1947, Harry also tried to move Warner Bros. headquarters from the longtime New York building to the Burbank area, but was unsuccessful. By the end of 1947, the studio had a record net profit of $22,000,000.00, although the following year, the studio profits would decrease by 50%. During this time, the studio was a party to the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust case. This action, brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, claimed that the five integrated studio-theater chain combinations restrained competition. The Supreme Court heard the case in 1948, and ruled for the government. As a result, Warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from exhibition. In early 1953, the brothers finally fulfilled their end of the bargain and sold their theater chain to Fabian Enterprises. In 1948, Bette Davis, now fed up with Jack Warner, would serve as a big problem for Harry after she, and a number of her colleagues, departed from the studio after completing the film Beyond the Forest. By 1949, the studio's net profit had fallen to $10,000,000.00, and the studio would soon suffer more losses with the rise of television. In 1949, Warner, seeing the threat of television grow, decided to shift his focus towards television production. However, the Federal Communications Commission would not allow Warner to do so. After an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch their focus to television, he abandoned his television efforts. As the threat of television grew in the early 1950s, Warner's younger brother, Jack, decided to try a new approach to help regain profits for the studio. In the wake of United Artist's successful 3-D film Bwana Devil, Jack decided to expand into 3-D films with the studio's film House of Wax (1953). While the film proved successful for the studio, 3-D films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers. After the downfall of 3-D films, Warner decided to use CinemaScope in future Warner Bros. films. One of the studio's first CinemaScope films, The High and Mighty, brought the studio some profit. In 1954, Warner and his brother Jack were finally able engage in the new television medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, Warner Bros. Presents. Warner Bros. Presents was not a success. In 1955, the studio was able debut a very successful western television drama, Cheyenne The studio then followed up with a series of Western dramas such as Maverick, Bronco and Colt .45. The studio's television westerns would, indeed, help accumulate for the net losses that the studio was now given at the box office Within a few years, Warner, who was accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, provoked hostility among emerging television stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute. Jack Warner was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors who seemed to show more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium. Through this success, Warner began to be known as the \\"Strategic Generalissimo\\" by his employees. By 1956, the studio's profits had dropped to new lows. Warner and Jack's tumultuous relationship worsened when Warner learned of Jack's decision to sell the Warner Bros.' pre-1949 films to United Artists Television for the modest sum of $21 million. \\"This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,\\" Warner exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal. Shortly after doing this, Jack took a long vacation in southern France. The brothers' fragile relationship was now worsening even more. == Retirement == In May 1956, the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, had secretly organized a syndicate, headed by Boston banker Serge Semenenko, which purchased 90% (800,000 shares) of the company's stock; Harry had at first rejected Semenenko's earlier offer to purchase his stock in February 1956, but later accepted the offer after Semenenko increased his bid and agreed to make Simon Fabian-the head of Fabian Enterprises who had also become a friend of the Warners- the new Warner Bros. President. After the three brothers sold their stock, Jack (through his under-the-table deal with Sememenko) joined Semenenko's syndicate and bought back all his stock, which consisted of 200,000 shares. The deal was completed in July 1956 After which, Jack, who was now the company's largest stockholder, officially appointed himself as the new company President. Warner found out about Jack's dealing while reading an article in Variety magazine on May 31, 1956 and collapsed after reading the news. The next day, he checked into Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and doctors told him he had a suffered a minor heart attack the previous day. While at the hospital, Warner also suffered a stroke that impaired his walking ability and forced him to use a cane for the rest of his life. Six days after his stroke, he left the hospital and decided to sell forty-two of his thoroughbred racehorses. This subterfuge proved too much for Warner and he and his family never spoke to Jack again; when Jack made a surprise appearance at Harry's San Fernadino ranch, to attend Harry's 1957 wedding anniversary to Rea Levinson, nobody in the Warner family attending the event spoke to Jack. All Warner was now dedicated to doing was raising horses. Shortly after this, when Jack was away one day, Warner made one last visit to the studio to take $6,000,000.00 out of his old studio account. He gave $3,000,000.00 to his wife Rea, and $1,500,000.00 each to his two daughters Doris and Betty. In the meantime, he sold a large portion of the remaining studio stock he had to Semenenko and made sure he would never come near the Burbank studio ever again. == Personal life == On August 23, 1907, Warner married his girlfriend, Rea Levinson. It has been reported by family members that Harry dedicated a huge chunk of his life to make Rea happy. Together, the couple also had three children: Lewis Ethan (b. October 10, 1908), Doris (b. September 13, 1913), and Betty Leah (b. May 4, 1920). Harry and his family were also very faithful to Jewish customs and traditions. On April 5, 1931, Warner's son Lewis, whom he appointed as head of Warner Bros. Music, died following the extraction of an infected, impacted wisdom tooth, which led to sepsis and then double pneumonia. Following Lewis' death, Warner, who was now left without a recognized heir to his empire, landed into an extreme state of depression. The following year, the Warners donated a theater in Lewis' honor to Worcester Academy, Lewis' alma mater. Warner also felt his brother Sam's widow, actress Lina Basquette, was a tramp and not worthy of raising a child with the last name Warner. While Jack didn't mind that Lina was Catholic, Harry and the rest of the Warner family did. They refused to have any part in Lina's life, and did not acknowledge her as a member of the Warner clan. In 1930, Basquette went broke and Warner decided to file for guardianship over Sam and Lina's daughter, Lita. On March 19, 1930, Warner and his wife Rea became the legal guardians of Lita through a 300,000 settlement in Lita's trust fund. Basquette was never financially able to take care of or regain custody of Lita and in 1931, she tried to commit suicide by poison. Following her suicide attempt, Basquette would only see her daughter on two occasions in the next twenty years. In 1947, Basquette filed for a large share of Sam's estate, which was by now worth $15,000,000 in stocks alone. Basquette claimed that the Warner brothers reorganized Sam's will under New York statutes, while Sam died while living in the state of California, where, at the time of Sam's death in 1927, laws gave widows a larger share in their husband's wills. The lawsuit eventually ended when Basquette settled for a $100,000 trust fund from Harry's fortune. Warner's daughter, Doris, was married to director Mervyn LeRoy on January 3, 1934. Because of their wedding, Warner, with no male heir to his studio after Lewis died, made LeRoy his new heir to the Warner Bros. studio. Together, the couple gave Harry two grandchildren, Warner Lewis LeRoy (b. 1935) and Linda LeRoy Janklow (b. 1939) (married to Morton L. Janklow). On one occasion, in the late 1930s, Doris read a copy of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind and became interested making a film adaption of the book for the studio as well; Doris then offered Mitchell $50,000 for the book's screen rights. However, Uncle Jack refused to allow the deal to take place, after seeing how expensive the film's budget would have been for the studio.Gone with the Wind would be made in 1939 by Selznick International Pictures-which would later be owned by Tuner Entertainment who ironically enough also owns Warner Brothers The couple would later divorce on August 12, 1945, and Warner was left without an heir again. Two months after her divorce from LeRoy, Doris would marry director Charles Vidor. Together the couple had three sons, Michael, Brian and Quentin. The two remained married until Vidor's death in 1959. In 1936, Betty Warner began an affair with one of Darryl F. Zanuck's assistants Milton Sperling. The two would marry on July 13, 1939. Through this marriage, the couple would also give Warner four more grandchildren, Susan (b. December 4, 1941), Karen (b. April 8, 1945), and Cass (b. March 8, 1948), and Matthew. The two remained married for twenty-four years. In 1964, Betty married Stanley Sheinbaum. His granddaughter, Cass Warner Sperling, and her husband, actor Wings Hauser, are the parents of actor Cole Hauser. == Death == Warner died on July 25, 1958 from a cerebral occlusion. Some people close to Harry, however, believed he died of a broken heart; Harry's wife Rea even stated, after Harry's funeral took place, that \\"he didn't die, Jack killed him.\\" He was entombed at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. He left an estate valued at $6,000,000 with 50% bequeathed to his wife and 25% to each of his daughters, Doris and Betty (married to producer Milton Sperling). For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Harry Warner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6441 Hollywood Boulevard. == Legacy == In 2004, Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania dedicated a film institute to him. The university also hosts an annual Harry Warner film festival. == In popular culture == * In an episode of Millionaire Hot Seat in Australia, contestant Barry Soraghan had a question for $1 million, which was about the Warner Brothers and which one of them had died on the eve of \\"The Jazz Singer\\". Harry Warner was incorrectly identified as the Warner brother who died on the eve of \\"The Jazz Singer\\" (Sam was the correct answer). == References == == Further reading == * Freedland, Michael.

Based on and very similar to the more widespread shipping containers (ISO containers), swap bodies normally have the same external dimensions for the bottom corner fittings as ISO shipping containers so that they can be placed on the same kinds of trucks, trailers and railroad cars designed for shipping containers. However, ISO containers inner dimensions (2.33 m wide) are just a few centimetres too short to accommodate European-pool pallets () without leaving much empty space. To optimise the carriage of pallets, wide bodies are often scaled to the maximum width allowed for standard road trucks and railroad cars and to a different length without leaving empty space. On the other hand, swap bodies do not have upper corner fittings, are not stackable and must be lifted by the bottom frame. Thus, they require special handling when transported by rail and are unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Swap Body or Demountable Body; notice the four legs deployed to support the frame (see text) Swap bodies take advantage of the large number of trailers used to carry standard ISO containers. The design of swap bodies and roller containers is optimized to minimize empty weight, saving on trucking fuel cost (less dead weight to be transported).and cost of built of reloading terminals. Due to security concerns, an increasing number of swap bodies have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins. Swap bodies are typically more expensive than equivalent payload ISO containers. This is because the ISO containers used in Europe are typically manufactured in China, whereas swap bodies are made in Europe (central Europe and the UK). This extra cost is offset by the lighter weight of the body and increased cargo capacity, resulting in fuel savings during transport. Many swap bodies are fitted with four up-folding legs under their frame. These legs make it possible to change, or swap, their body from one carriage to another, or to leave the swap body at a destination, without using extra equipment. such as a crane or hoist Special swap bodies may have more doors or sliding panels than ordinary hard boxes for trucks, railroad cars, or sea containers. This feature makes unloading and loading faster and easier. Many swap bodies are fitted with keyhole tracks. These secure a range of extras such as shoring bars and cargo nets to extend its uses in various applications. Recently a second flooring using folding shelves has been used to aid postal companies. Special steel frames or racks are available in certain container ships and container marshalling yards to hoist swap bodies from topside. All swap bodies are subject to extensive non- destructive (in most cases) testing, some in-house others not, regulated by certifying authorities. Basic standardization is set with Euronorms EN 283, EN 284 and EN 452 for construction and design, as well as EN 13044 for marking and identification. The panel responsible for developing standards is CEN/TC 119. The outcome of this panel has not yet provided any contribution to automation, as handling the swap bodies is a traditional haulage business with truck drivers involved. == See also == * CargoBeamer * Containerization * Containerlift * Roller container * Semi-trailer * Sidelifter * Tank chassis * ULD == Notes == Category:Shipping containers ","title":"Swap body"},{"id":"1298650","text":"First edition (publ.

Among his film successes are The Bridge (1929), The Tuttles of Tahiti (1942), The Desperadoes (1943), Cover Girl (1944), Together Again (1944), A Song to Remember (1945), Over 21 (1945), Gilda (1946), The Loves of Carmen (1948), Love Me or Leave Me (1955), The Swan (1956), The Joker Is Wild (1957), and A Farewell to Arms (1957). ==Life and career== Born K√°roly Vidor to a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He first came to prominence during the final years of the silent film era, working with Alex Korda among others. Contrary to common belief, he is not related to fellow director King Vidor (1894‚Äì1982). ===Early Hollywood career=== In 1922, Vidor emigrated to the United States. He worked as a basso for the English Grand Opera Company. He was a chorus boy in Love Song and worked on Hudson Bay as a longshoreman. Vidor went to Hollywood where he worked as Korda's assistant. He attracted acclaim for a low budget short he made in his spare time with his own money, The Bridge (1929). This led to a contract at Universal Pictures to work in the editorial department. He did some uncredited directing on MGM's The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932). His first credited feature as director was Sensation Hunters (1933) for Monogram Pictures. Vidor followed it with Double Door (1934) at Paramount. ===RKO=== Vidor accepted a contract to work at RKO Pictures. While there he directed Strangers All (1935), His Family Tree (1935), The Arizonian (1935), and Muss 'Em Up (1936). ===Paramount=== Vidor went back to Paramount where he directed A Doctor's Diary (1937), The Great Gambini (1937), and She's No Lady (1937). ===Columbia Pictures=== Vidor signed with Columbia Pictures where he directed Romance of the Redwoods (1939), Blind Alley (1939) and Those High Grey Walls (1939). These were lower budgeted productions but they were well received. \\"I enjoyed those little pictures\\", he said later. Frank Capra got Vidor in to do some second unit work on Mr Smith Goes to Washington (1939), which was running behind schedule. Vidor directed the scenes in Smith's home town. \\"I had more money to spend than I was ever given to make a feature picture\\", he later said. Vidor was loaned out to Edward Small to direct My Son, My Son! (1940). Back at Columbia, he began to be assigned to more prestigious films like The Lady in Question (1940). He took over from James Whale on They Dare Not Love (1941) and did Ladies in Retirement (1941). Vidor was loaned to Paramount to direct New York Town (1941) and RKO for The Tuttles of Tahiti (1942). Back at Columbia, Vidor directed the studio's first Technicolor movie, The Desperadoes (1943). He followed it with the Rita Hayworth‚ÄìGene Kelly musical, Cover Girl (1944) which was a huge success. On June 11, 1944 Vidor signed a seven-year contract with Columbia. Vidor did Together Again (1944) then made a biopic of Chopin, A Song to Remember (1945), which was another big hit, and made a star of Cornel Wilde. After Over 21 (1946) with Irene Dunne, Vidor directed another classic film with Gilda (1946) starring Hayworth and Glenn Ford. ===Clashes with Harry Cohn=== Vidor was Columbia's leading director but he was fighting with head of production Harry Cohn ‚Äì for instance, Cohn wanted Vidor to direct Johnny O'Clock but Vidor refused. He started directing The Guilt of Janet Ames (1947), but fought with Cohn and was replaced during filming by Henry Levin. In 1946 Vidor sued Columbia, seeking to be released from his contract and $78,000 in damages. The case went to trial, where Vidor argued that he had been treated badly by Cohn, who swore at him. (Cohn admitted the swearing but said this was his way of expressing himself.) He also said Cohn would not loan him $25,000 to buy a new house and that Cohn made him cry twice by yelling at him. The judge ruled against Vidor, ordering him back to work. Vidor began directing Ford and William Holden in The Man from Colorado (1949) but clashed with Cohn once more over the shooting schedule and was fired during filming for being too slow, being replaced by Levin. The matter settled and Vidor was reunited with Hayworth and Ford for the expensive The Loves of Carmen (1948). Columbia exercised their option under Vidor's contract. In 1948 Vidor announced he had purchased rights to Sirocco, a French Foreign Legion tale based on the novel Coup de Grace he wanted to make with Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart. He was also preparing to do the film version of Born Yesterday and did a few days uncredited work on Under Cover Man. In August 1949 Vidor was assigned the musical The Petty Girl (1950). He refused to do it, Columbia put him on suspension, and Vidor told Columbia that he considered his contract with them at an end. (He was replaced on The Petty Girl by Levin). In September Columbia sued Vidor to stop him walking out on the contract. In October 1949 Vidor bought himself out of his contract for $75,000 at $15,000 a year for five years. Louis B. Mayer had acted as intermediary \\"for the good of the industry\\". Vidor's career had two years to run, at $3,000 a week then $3,500 a week. ===MGM=== In December 1949 Vidor signed a contract with MGM to direct The Running of the Tide which was never made. Vidor was one of several directors on MGM's It's a Big Country (1951). Vidor went to Paramount with a project he had developed himself, Thunder in the East (filmed 1951, released 1952), which starred Alan Ladd. Sam Goldwyn used him on Hans Christian Andersen (1952) which was a huge success. After filming Vidor optioned the novel SPQR and announced he would film it independently but it was not made. At MGM Vidor did a musical with Elizabeth Taylor, Rhapsody (1954) and a biopic of Ruth Etting, Love Me or Leave Me (1955), a big success. Vidor directed Grace Kelly's last movie, The Swan (1956). In 1956 he announced he had formed his own company, Aurora, to make The Life of Nijinsky. ===Final years=== Vidor went into partnership with Frank Sinatra and Joe E. Lewis to make a biopic of the latter, The Joker Is Wild (1957). Sinatra and Vidor were going to reunite on Kings Go Forth but then David O. Selznick hired Vidor to make the troubled A Farewell to Arms (1957), replacing John Huston. Vidor's last film was an attempt to repeat the success of A Song to Remember, another biopic of a composer, in this case Liszt: Song Without End (1960) (originally titled A Magic Flame). He died of a heart attack three weeks into filming. ==Personal life== He was married four times: * Frances Varone 1927‚Äì1931 * the actress Karen Morley 1932‚Äì1943 (separated 1940) * the actress Evelyn Keyes 1943‚Äì1945 * Doris Warner, daughter of Warner Bros. President Harry Warner, 1945‚Äì1959 (until his death) He had three sons ‚Äì Quentin, Brian and Michael. ==Death== Charles Vidor died in Vienna, Austria, from a heart attack, aged 58. He was in the midst of making Song Without End, and was replaced as director by George Cukor. He was entombed at Home of Peace Cemetery in the same mausoleum as Harry Warner.Resting Places == Recognition == Vidor has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6676 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to motion pictures. ==Filmography== * The Bridge (1929 short) * The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932) (uncredited) * Sensation Hunters (1933) * Double Door (1934) * Strangers All (1935) * The Arizonian (1935) * His Family Tree (1935) * Muss 'em Up (1936) * Sinister House (1936) * A Doctor's Diary (1937) * The Great Gambini (1937) * She's No Lady (1937) * Romance of the Redwoods (1939) * Blind Alley (1939) * Those High Grey Walls (1939) * My Son, My Son!

Collins immediately helped the Bulls turn around their fortunes, showing an improvement of 10 games in each of his first two seasons, coaching Chicago to a 50-32 record in his second year. In his third year as coach, he brought Chicago to their first Eastern Conference Finals Appearance in 15 years, however, they were unable to get past their Central Division rival the \\"Bad Boys\\" Detroit Pistons. Despite the Bulls' success and his popularity in Chicago, Collins was fired in the summer of 1989. ===Detroit Pistons=== Collins was named the head coach of the Detroit Pistons in 1995. His arrival in Detroit was similar to his in Chicago, as the Pistons had a second-year star who drew comparisons to Michael Jordan, Grant Hill. In his first season, he was able to improve the team's previous season's record by 18 games and lead them back to the playoffs, though they would be swept by the Orlando Magic. A fast start in his second season pushed Hill to the top of MVP consideration and Collins was named the Eastern Conference All- Star team's coach. The highlight of the year for Collins came on April 13, when the Pistons defeated the defending champion Bulls to end Detroit's 19-game losing streak against Chicago. (Ironically Collins ended a Chicago losing streak against the Pistons in the 80's.) The Pistons finished 54-28 and lost in the first round of playoffs to the Atlanta Hawks, 3‚Äì2 in the best-of- five series. He served as Pistons' head coach until February 2, 1998, when he was fired and replaced by Alvin Gentry. Collins then became a television broadcaster, working for many years at various networks, such as NBC on the NBA on NBC and TNT on the NBA on TNT. ===Washington Wizards=== He worked as a broadcaster for about three years before being hired to coach the Washington Wizards for the start of the 2001‚Äì02 NBA season. In Washington, Collins was reunited with Michael Jordan and Charles Oakley. Once again, in his first season with his new team, Collins improved the team's previous season's record by 18 games. Though his .451 winning percentage through 2 seasons was better than the Wizards' .308 record the previous 2 seasons (and subsequent .305 record the following season), Collins was fired at the conclusion of the 2002‚Äì03 season. ===Philadelphia 76ers=== On May 21, 2010, Collins was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. While the 76ers initially started out poorly with a record of 3-13, the team showed great improvement as the season went on, and clinched the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. Under Collins, the team increased its win total by 14 games over the previous season. They lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat in the first round, but were able to avoid a sweep that had been predicted. Collins finished second in Coach of the Year voting that season. In the lockout-shortened 2011‚Äì2012 season, Collins led the Sixers to an improved record, but Philadelphia was only able to take the eighth seed in the playoffs. Against the top seeded Chicago Bulls, Collins led the Sixers to their first playoff series victory since 2003. It was the fifth time in NBA history that an eighth seed defeated a first seed in a playoff series. They took the next series against the Boston Celtics to seven games, but lost. Collins resigned as 76ers coach on April 18, 2013, citing a need to spend more time with his five grandchildren. It was announced that he would stay with the team as an adviser. ==National team career== Collins represented the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Those basketball games are remembered by U.S. fans mainly for the controversial gold medal basketball game between the United States and the Soviet Union, in which Collins played a key part. ==Broadcasting career== Collins started doing work for CBS in the mid-1980s, calling mostly playoff games. He also was the lead color analyst for the local broadcasts of the 76ers' games during the 1985‚Äì86 season. In-between his various coaching stints he has done broadcasting work for CBS, NBC, TNT, TBS, and ABC/ESPN. He also called games for the New York Knicks during the 2003-04 season on MSG Network on a part-time basis, paired with Marv Albert.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/sports/sports-briefing- pro-basketball-collins-to-work-on-msg.html After being fired by the Wizards, Collins returned to announcing games for TNT. In addition, he served as an analyst for NBC Sports' TV coverage of basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He also was a basketball analyst for NBC during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. During this time, Collins's name surfaced several times regarding head coaching vacancies. In 2005, he was a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks job but was passed over for Terry Stotts. Collins was approached by the team again in 2008 to serve as their GM and coach but turned them down again. In May 2008, Collins was in negotiations to coach the Chicago Bulls, nearly 20 years after he was fired from the team.\\"Bulls poised to hire Collins as Coach\\", ESPN, May 30, 2008 accessed December 28, 2009. However, Collins withdrew his name when he and owner Jerry Reinsdorf \\"agreed it wasn't the best to keep going this way,\\" in light of their close personal friendship.\\"Collins, Reinsdorf agree coaching search continues ‚Ä¶ minus Collins \\", ESPN, June 6, 2008 accessed December 28, 2009. ==Executive career== On September 19, 2017, the Chicago Bulls announced that Collins has joined the team as senior advisor of basketball operations. ==Personal life== Collins and his wife Kathy have two children. They reside in the Delaware Valley. Their son Chris, a former Duke University basketball player, is the head basketball coach at Northwestern University and their daughter Kelly, who played basketball at Lehigh University, is a school teacher in Pennsylvania. ==Honors== Illinois State University's basketball court is named after Collins (Doug Collins Court at Redbird Arena). A statue depicting Collins and his ISU coach, Will Robinson, was unveiled on September 19, 2009, outside the north entrance of Redbird Arena. ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Philadelphia  25   17.4  .371   .764  1.8  1.6  .5  .1  8.0 -

The name is derived from \\"enteric cytopathic human orphan virus\\". These viruses were originally not associated with disease but many have since been identified as disease-causing agents. The term \\"echovirus\\" was used in the scientific names of numerous species. However, all echoviruses are now recognized as strains of various species, most of which are in the family Picornaviridae. ==List of echoviruses== The 34 echoviruses are listed hereafter: * Human echoviruses 1‚Äì7, 9, 11‚Äì21, 24‚Äì27, and 29‚Äì33 are strains of the species Enterovirus B of the genus Enterovirus. * Human echovirus 8 was shown to be identical to Human echovirus 1 and was abolished as a species. * Human echovirus 10 was reclassified as a strain of the species Reovirus type 1, currently named Mammalian orthoreovirus of the genus Orthoreovirus, which belongs to the family Reoviridae.

It tells the story of a group of history students who travel to 14th- century France to rescue their professor. The book follows in Crichton's long history of combining science, technical details, and action in his books, this time addressing quantum and multiverse theory. The novel spawned Timeline Computer Entertainment, a computer game developer that created the Timeline PC game published by Eidos Interactive in 2000. Additionally, an eponymous film based on the book was released in 2003. ==Plot== In Corazon, Dan Baker and his wife are lost and driving through the Northern Arizona desert when they come across a man in his seventies who looks like a priest. They pull over to help him, then take him to a hospital in Gallup, New Mexico. They learn that the man works at ITC and has unexplainable growth abnormalities in his blood vessels. The man dies twenty-four hours later. In the Dordogne (southwest) portion of France, Archeology Professor Edward Johnston leads a group of relatively young archaeologists-Chris Hughes, Kate Erickson, and Andr√© Marek- as they study the fourteenth-century towns of Castelgard and La Roque. Professor Johnston travels to New Mexico because he has reason to believe ITC, their funds provider, is guilty of foul play. During his absence, his students discover several disturbing sights, including the lens to Professor Johnston‚Äôs glasses and an inexplicable message from him. Chris, Kate, Andr√©, and a computer specialist named David Stern are whisked away to ITC Headquarters in New Mexico by the company's vice president John Gordon. Once there, ITC CEO Robert Doniger informs them that Professor Johnston has traveled to 1357 using their undisclosed quantum technology. The students decide to venture into the past to rescue the professor. Stern chooses to stay behind, realizing that time travel is probably terrible for one‚Äôs biology. Immediately when they arrive in 1357, they are attacked by knights. Their ITC guards are murdered, and one activates a grenade before he is fatally wounded, and inadvertently initiates his return, causing the return pad in the present to be severely damaged. Stern and the ITC employees then struggle to repair it so the students can return home. Kate and Andr√© find Professor Johnston; Lord Oliver of Castelgard is keeping him under arrest as he is convinced Professor Johnston knows the secret passageway to the famous castle of La Roque, which is commanded by Arnaut de Cervole, Lord Oliver‚Äôs arch-nemesis, who plans to attack Lord Oliver‚Äôs domain. Meanwhile, Chris inadvertently tells a boy-in- disguise that he is a nobleman, and the boy is revealed to be a woman named Lady Claire in disguise. She takes Chris to Sir Guy de Malegant, her fianc√©. Chris and Andr√© (who has since found Chris) meet Guy, who challenges them to a joust: Chris‚Äôs proclamation of nobility and his flirtations with certain women have turned him into the enemy of several men. The two escape thanks to Andr√©‚Äôs intelligence and knowledge of the area. Oliver orders the students‚Äô deaths. They flee and are pursued by Guy and his knight, Robert de Kere. To keep Lord Oliver‚Äôs men from pursuing them, the students look for the secret passage to La Roque. Chris and Kate focus on the secret passage while Andr√© gains entry into Castelgard by posing as Professor Johnston‚Äôs assistant. Andr√© learns that the professor is helping Lord Oliver build a weapon to defeat Arnaut‚Äôs incoming forces, believing that Oliver will lose the siege as he is supposed to. Simultaneously, Chris learns that another future-person is helping De Cervole‚Äôs forces. The man is revealed to be de Kere, who is really Robert Deckard, an ITC worker who has undergone so many quantum leaps that his DNA is tampered and weakened, much like the seventy-year-old man the couple in Arizona found at the beginning of the novel. Deckard plans to take the next trip to the future for himself. Arnaut begins the siege of Castelgard, and eventually emerges victorious. During the battle, Kate runs away from Guy and sends him falling to his death. Andr√© and Chris free Professor Johnston from a dungeon. They see Arnaut battling Oliver, which ends with the latter being trapped in a deep pit. As the time travelers flee, Chris is attacked by Deckard, but kills him by setting him on fire with gunpowder supplied by Professor Johnston. Stern and the ITC employees repair the machine just in time for the students' return. Andr√© realizes that he has longed for this life, and convinces the others to return to the present without him. Back in the present, the team is confronted by Doniger, who, having had little concern for their safety, intends to exploit the quantum technology for his own monetary gain. Fed up with his boss, Gordon knocks him out and uses the machine to trap him in 1348 Europe, during the Black Plague. The novel concludes with an epilogue. Chris and Kate are now married and expecting their first child. While digging through a site one day, they come across the grave of Andr√© and Lady Claire. They are pleased to know the two led a happy life together, and that Andr√© never forgot them. == Style == === Point of view === The novel is written in the third person omniscient point of view. Crichton uses many voices to tell his story, including those of the main characters Marek, Kate, and Chris, as well as those of minor characters, such as the couple who finds a confused man wandering in the desert, and the cop who cannot accept the incredible story of an old man who simply wandered away from his own car in the desert. == Characters == === Andre Marek === Andre Marek is a researcher who works with Professor Johnston in Dordogne. Marek has always had a fascination with medieval times that is so intense that he has taught himself to joust, to fight with a sword, and to shoot a longbow. Therefore, when Marek gets the chance to go to that era, via ITC's invention, he jumps at it. Marek proves himself very brave in the medieval world. He fights multiple soldiers, not hesitating to take their lives; bravely stands up to medieval warlords and Archpriests; and is very convincing in the role of a knight. No one - not even knights who oppose him - have a doubt about his being one, fully entitled to be called \\"Sir Andre\\". Ultimately, Marek realizes that he was meant to live in this period. For this reason, he chooses to remain behind. When Professor Johnston, Kate, and Chris return to their own world, they find Marek's grave and discover that he lived a happy life in that alternate universe. === Kate Erikson === Kate Erickson began her college career as an architecture student but found it boring and switched her major to history. Kate now works the Dordogne site from the perspective of architecture, examining the ruins to see how they were built and to make recommendations for restoration. Kate is part of Marek's team that travels to the 14th century to save Professor Johnston. Kate repeatedly demonstrates her bravery and uses her climbing skills to outwit the soldiers of the period. Kate is also something of a romantic and falls in love with Chris during the adventure. === Chris Hughes === Chris Hughes is a student of Professor Johnston's. Chris‚Äô specialty at the archeological site at Dordogne is the mill; he is trying to determine whether or not the mill was fortified, a feature that was fairly new at the time. When Johnston disappears and Marek asks Chris to be part of the team that rescues him, Chris jumps at the chance. Chris is something of a weakling who often finds himself getting in difficult situations, usually over women. When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, and his lie causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, he single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill Chris' entire team. === Professor Edward Johnston === Professor Edward Johnston is a college professor who is in charge of the archeological site at Dordogne, in France. Johnston is an inspiration to and supportive of his students, and they admire him. When Johnston goes missing after traveling to New Mexico to confront ITC's CEO, his team rallies to find a way to save him. Johnston has traveled to the past through a separate universe. He has been found by the local people and for this reason has created a new persona for himself, as a Magister who has come to help the local monastery's abbot look for important information in their archives. In this capacity, Johnston quickly becomes something of a local legend. This causes Sir Oliver to request his help in defeating Arnaut. Johnston plays along until the moment comes when he can return home. === David Stern === David Stern is a computer geek who takes a job with the Dordogne River Valley archeological site just to be close to where his girlfriend is attending school. When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern to be part of the team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands it better than anyone else and, therefore, is also the only one who recognizes that it is dangerous and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival via his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team. Stern saves their lives. ==Reception== Cahners Business Information says the book will \\"grab teens' attention from the very first page\\", and Entertainment Weekly calls Timeline \\"exhilarating entertainment.\\" The novel has also grasped the attention of scholars of medievalism, since Crichton praises Norman Cantor's Inventing the Middle Ages (1999) as a central influence on his characterization of academic research on the medieval past. Crichton's narrative seems to support Cantor's notion that the work of academic medievalists amounts to little more than subjective reinventions of the medieval era.Utz, Richard. (2017). Medievalism: A Manifesto. UK: Bradford; Kalamazoo, MI: ARC Humanities Press. Pages 31-32. ==Film adaptation== Paramount Pictures produced a feature film adaptation, with a budget of $80 million, released on November 26, 2003. The adaptation was written by Jeff Maguire and George Nolfi, and directed by Richard Donner, and stars Paul Walker as Chris, Gerard Butler as Marek, Billy Connolly as Professor Johnston, and Frances O'Connor as Kate. The film was poorly received by critics and audiences alike. ==See also== * Hundred Years War ==References== ==External links== * Official Site Category:Novels about time travel Category:1999 American novels Category:1999 science fiction novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by Michael Crichton Category:Alfred A.

It was first announced by the Government of Canada on 13 December 2004. The DNCL has been labelled a \\"disaster\\" and over a decade after the law's creation, many telemarketers are either unaware or do not follow the rules imposed by the DNCL. The DNCL continues to receive heavy criticism, the latest being from Senator Percy Downe who referred to it as \\"totally useless\\", due to the costly but totally ineffective enforcement, the large number of exempt groups and the ability for anyone from anywhere in the world to purchase sets of phone numbers for relatively low fees, and then abuse the Do Not Call List as a calling list. Senator Downe cited multiple examples of constituents, whom he had personally added to the list, receiving a sudden increase in telemarketing calls three months later. On 20 April 2009, the CRTC announced that telephone and fax numbers on the list would be listed on the DNCL for five years, extended from the three years at the list's inception. Numbers are now on the list indefinitely. ==Overview== Legislation entitled Bill C-37, An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act, introduced in the House of Commons, was given first reading on 13 December 2004. It addressed telemarketing calls in Canada and would allow people to sign up to prevent certain telemarketers from contacting them. It received royal assent on 25 November 2005 and came into force on 30 June 2006. The legislation gives the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) authority to establish a national do not call list, to establish procedures to administer the Act and to levy penalties for violations. Starting 30 September 2008, residents of Canada were able to register their telephone numbers on the list online, or by telephone, fax or teletype. ==Exemptions== The Do Not Call List exempts Canadian registered charities, political parties, riding associations, candidates, pollsters and newspapers of general circulation for the purpose of soliciting subscriptions. Telemarketing calls from organizations with whom residents have an existing business relationship are also exempt. Telemarketers may also still call if a resident gave them permission in a written form or verbally. This law also does not extend its protections to non-Canadian phone numbers. Paragraph 41.7(4) of The Telecommunications Act requires that every exempted telemarketer \\"shall maintain their own do not call list and shall ensure that no telecommunication is made on their behalf to any person who has requested that they receive no telecommunication...\\". Unlike the DNCL Rules, the Act itself makes no provision for a grace period or expiry, so all do not call requests must be honoured immediately and permanently. In letters dated 27 June 2008, to the Canadian Marketing Association (CMA) and the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA), CRTC Chairman Konrad von Finckenstein personally ruled that do not call requests from third parties, such as iOptOut.ca, are to be considered \\"...as valid requests and must be honoured.\\" Due to its overwhelming popularity, iOptOut.ca is currently being upgraded and improved. On 13 November 2008, the CRTC declined a request from telecommunications provider Rogers Wireless to permit Canadian wireless customers to block unsolicited SMS text messages through the DNCL. ==Timeline== The privacy benefits the list will achieve remain uncertain. A working group of the CRTC held hearings concerning the planned implementation of the list. It submitted recommendations on 26 July 2006. On 3 July 2007, the CRTC announced it would be issuing a request for proposals to suppliers willing to provide this service. On 21 December 2007, the CRTC announced that it had picked Bell Canada to operate the National Do Not Call List for five years. It is funded from subscription fees paid by telemarketers, rather than relying on fees by end citizens. It became operational on 30 September 2008. ==Criticism== Michael Geist, professor of law at the University of Ottawa, has criticized the changes adopted in the amended Act. He observed that the legislation contained too many exemptions which would not result in a significant decrease in calls for subscribers of the DNCL. Geist expressed particular concern about the extent and duration of the existing business relationship exception. In a 2009 article for the Toronto Star, Geist labelled the CRTC's do-not-call list a \\"disaster\\" and recommended that parliament return to the original version of Bill C-37 by eliminating all exemptions. He further recommended cross-border cooperation to resolve jurisdictional issues and immediate tough enforcement to send a strong signal to violators. In November 2008, it was reported that the CRTC had received thousands of complaints from individuals about the implementation of the Do Not Call List. People reported that they had actually experienced a notable increase in the number of calls since registering for the list, and were starting to get calls at cellular phone numbers that had never received telemarketing calls before. However, a VoxPop study found that 80% of those registered on the DNCL had noticed a reduction in calls, while 13% had seen an increase. The study concluded that the most likely explanation for the increase was due to timing of the launch of the DNCL with the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 which was hitting American and other foreign companies harder than Canadian, and where unscrupulous telemarketers that did not care about Canadian laws were using random dialers to find new business. In January 2009, numerous media and consumer advocacy organizations reported that anyone can use false information pretending to be a telemarketer and download a set of numbers from the list for a $50 fee. It took their reporter ten minutes to do so. It has been proposed that list may be being downloaded and used as a telemarketing list overseas, where there's little that can be done as the CRTC has no jurisdiction outside of Canada. Konrad von Finckenstein, Chair of the CRTC, responded to these allegations on 16 June 2009, labeling them an urban myth, and stating that the Government had looked into the claims and that there was \\"no evidence to substantiate them\\". ===Technological shortcomings=== A notable shortcoming of the Canadian implementation of the do-not-call list is that the list of numbers is given to telemarketers in plain text, in the form of a simple spreadsheet or CSV file without any protection or traceability. Technologies for securing personal data are readily available, as evidenced by the Australia Do Not Call Register, which \\"is a secure database where you can list your numbers to avoid receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls and marketing faxes.\\" In contrast to the CRTC's uncontrolled distribution of telephone number lists, the Australian system consists of a \\"List Washing Service\\", precisely as proposed by the minority opinion which was disregarded by the CRTC. On 3 July 2007, in Telecom Decision CRTC 2007-47, the CRTC disregarded the non-consensus report from the DNCL Operations Working Group, which had strongly recommended against allowing telemarketers to download unmarked, untraceable copies of the do-not- call list. With the aim of protecting the confidentiality of cell and unlisted numbers, the non-consensus report had instead advocated a Query/Response methodology, wherein telemarketers would be able to query only the do-not-call status of numbers they already had in their possession. Although the CRTC had rejected the Query/Response methodology, citing grounds of operational cost and complexity, a one-number-at-a-time Query/Response turned out to be so operationally simple and inexpensive that it is provided by the CRTC, free of charge, without restriction, to anyone who cares to use it. Other jurisdictions such as the USA provide similar Query/Response functions to check lists of small sets of numbers simultaneously, also free of charge. Jurisdictions such as Australia protect subscriber privacy, precisely as envisioned by the minority report, by keeping the list in the form of a secure database, and providing only a \\"List Washing Service\\". The CRTC's decision to expire registrations is regarded by citizens' rights groups as a technical shortcoming that adds unnecessary operational cost and complexity to the system, as well as limiting registrants' freedom to express their wishes. On 17 June 2008, the USA made registrations permanent until the number is disconnected or reassigned, citing \\"...benefits to the public and to consumer privacy interests...\\". Another possibility to prevent using the plain text list as a list of people to call is to provide honeypot numbers, unique to each telemarketer. If a telemarketer, or anyone he has given the list to, then calls one of the honeypot numbers, stiff penalties can be applied to the telemarketer. If the originating number of a violating call is either foreign or disguised, the CRTC could apply the penalties to the telco which delivered the call to the subscriber's line since that telco acted as an agent of the telemarketer by delivering the call.. There is no indication from the CRTC as to whether honeypots have been implemented as part of the DNCL. ==Non- governmental DNCL supplements== On 28 March 2008 Michael Geist introduced iOptOut.ca, a free service which assisted in the process of creating a personal do not call list. The service notified callers selected by the user from a list of available businesses that the individual exercised his or her right under privacy laws not to receive communications from the notified business. It was intended to cover those organizations excluded from the DNCL. Like the DNCL, iOptOut.ca was dependent on citizens lodging complaints on the DNCL site or phone number in order to bring charges against telemarketers under telemarketing laws. In 2009, iOptOut.ca began claiming that it was currently being upgraded and improved, due to its overwhelming popularity. It has not been in operation since, and as of 2 August 2018, iOptOut.ca redirects visitors to Michael Geist's personal web site, michaelgeist.ca. The Canadian Marketing Association offers a free \\"Do Not Contact Service\\". The service is limited to screening telemarketing from participating companies only. Registration can be sought by mail, phone (1-866-580-3625) or online at their website http://www.the-cma.org. After registration, it takes six weeks to be effective and lasts for three years but is only for mail distributions. The CMA redirects visitors to register with the CRTC's Do Not Call List. ==See also== * Do Not Call Register (Australia) * New Zealand Name Removal Service * Telephone Preference Service (United Kingdom) * National Do Not Call Registry (United States) * Robinson list, a UK opt-out registry of people who do not wish to receive marketing communications ==References== ==External links== * Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission National Do Not Call List (DNCL) ==Sources== * Facts about the National Do Not Call List CRTC information regarding the September 2008 launch of the National Do Not Call List * Canada's Do Not Hesitate to Call List, Geist, 11 September 2005 * Canada's Do-Not-Hesitate-To-Call List Goes From Bad to Worse Geist, 20 October 2005 * Industry Canada announcement of 13 December 2004 * Bill C-37 * Web Site * Notice of May 2, 2006 CRTC Hearing * Do Not Call:Hanging Up on the Telemarketers, CBC In Depth Report, 25 November 2005 Category:2006 establishments in Canada Category:Telemarketing Category:Privacy in Canada ","title":"National Do Not Call List"},{"id":"1298703","text":"Ladino may refer to: *Judaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino (ISO 639‚Äì3 lad), a language primarily spoken among Sephardic Jews, and in particular a written form of Judaeo-Spanish used in Sephardic religious texts, secular literature, and songs *Ladino people, a socio-ethnic category of Mestizo or Hispanicized people in Central America especially in Guatemala *Black ladinos, a historical ethnic community in Medieval Spain *Ladin language (ISO 639‚Äì3 lld), a Romance language spoken in Northern Italy, known in Italian as Ladino *Ladino (surname) *Ladino (rural locality), a rural locality (a village) in Novorzhevsky District of Pskov Oblast, Russia *Ladino, a hardy type of large white clover, often grown as a forage crop *Ladino, a variety of Mexican Spanish spoken in New Mexico *Ladino poem, a 19th-century Philippine poetry style ==See also== *Ladina, a village in Croatia *Latino (disambiguation) Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Ladino"},{"id":"1298705","text":"A regional jirga in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. A jirga (originally j…ôrga or j…ôrgah; Pashto: ) is a traditional assembly of leaders, criticized as Kangaroo courts by critics, that supposed to make decisions by consensus and according to the teachings of Pashtunwali. A tribal cultural system that predates modern-day written or fixed-laws and is conducted to settle disputes among the Pashtun people but to a lesser extent among other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as Afghans) in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Its primary purpose has been to prevent tribal war. Most jirgas are conducted in Afghanistan but also among the Pashtun tribes in neighboring Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). In 2017, the Pakistani government passed The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017 of Pakistan aiming to integrate jirgas into the formal justice system. In a January 2019 petition from National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), Supreme Court of Pakistan restrained jirgas up to permissible limits of the law to the extent of acting as arbitration, mediation, negotiation or reconciliation forums between parties involved in a civil dispute, amidst continued reports of widespread flouting of constitutional norms and human rights. According to The Economist, ‚Äúbarbarism has become synonymous with jirgas‚Äù due to their use of punishments such as burning the house of a criminal, though others view such punishments as rare and originating from illiterate backwaters. Pakistani daily newspaper Dawn's, an early June 2020 editorial says that, unlawful jirgas are not limited to tribal district but do operate across Pakistan with impunity. While in January 2019 Supreme Court of Pakistan adjudicated against unlawful practices in Jirgas and Panchayats, in July 2019 Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan expressed his government's commitment on continuation of Jirga system. == Terminology and function == === Origin and historicity === Jirga might be cognate to Mongolian —Ü–∏—Ä–∫ (ts…ôrk), referring to a large assembly of men forming a very broad circle, initially intended for laying siege around games or animals to be hunted for sport or for food. Probably, the Pashtun elders were also sitting initially in a circular formation when debating and hearing a given dispute. === Functioning methodology === The community council meaning is often found in circumstances involving a dispute between two individuals; a jirga may be part of the dispute resolution mechanism in such cases. The disputants would usually begin by finding a mediator, choosing someone such as a senior religious leader, a local notable, or a mediation specialist (a khan or M…ôsh…ôr). In tribal Pashtun society, the Maliks serve as de facto arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national jirgas as well as to Parliament. The mediator hears from the two sides and then forms a Jirga of community elders, taking care to include supporters of both sides. The jirga then considers the case and, after discussing the matter, comes to a decision about how to handle it, which the mediator then announces. The jirga's conclusion is binding. === Quasi-legal function === The jirga was also used as a court in cases of criminal conduct, but this usage is being replaced by formal courts in some settled areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, elsewhere it is still used as courts in tribal regions. The jirga holds the prestige of a court in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Although a political agent appointed by the national government maintains law and order through the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR), the actual power lies in the jirga. The political agent maintains law and order in his tribal region with the help of jirgas. The jirga can award capital punishment, such as stoning to death in case of adultery, or expulsion from the community. In the recent military operations against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan's restive southern tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan, jirgas played a key role of moderator between the government and the militants. The tradition of jirga has also been adopted by Muslims in the Kashmir valley of Indian-administered Kashmir. === The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, of Pakistan === As per 2017 political dispensation in Government, unofficial Jirga and Panchayats are very popular among masses, so formal recognition of the same will help make the system more transparent and responsible, while left leaning political dispensations in opposition expressed their apprehension that weaker sections will suffer while feudalism will benefit. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017 of Pakistan makes provision for selection of neutral observing arbitrator from Government approved panel agreed by parties. If a dispute is resolved amicably the court will formalize judgement, and if not parties can choose to opt-in further formal judicial administration for their grievances. Basit Mahmood criticizes the bill's provisions allowing the government to appoint ‚Äúneutrals‚Äù to each jirga not being sufficient since the so-called \\"neutrals\\", who must approve their verdicts would most likely be consisting of retired judges and religious scholars of conservative nature and that will put principle of neutrality upside down and that will substantially affect on the lives of women across the Pakistan. Basit Mahmood also criticizes United Kingdom's donor agency Department for International Development for funding of misogyny protecting ADR tribunals. ==== Contested justice and human rights violations ==== In a January 2019 on petition from National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) judgement Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that, beyond permissible limits of the law to the extent of acting as arbitration, mediation, negotiation or reconciliation forums between parties involved in a civil dispute who willingly consent to the same; rest of practices and attempts by Jirgas to adjudicate on civil or criminal matters is not lawful, and that unlawful practices of Jirgas are violate Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 25 and 175(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, and also that \\"operation of jirgas/ panchayats, etc violates Pakistan‚Äôs international commitments under the UDHR, ICCPR and CEDAW, which place a responsibility on the state of Pakistan to ensure that everyone has access to courts or tribunals, (and all people) are treated equally before the law and in all stages of procedure in courts and tribunals\\". According to correspondent I.A. Rehman, In January 2019 Pakistani government law officials from provinces and federal confirmed governments-made commitments to Supreme Court of Pakistan to not to allow Panchayat and Jirga platforms for illegal practices of violating fundamental constitutional rights of women by honour killings, wani, swara, karo kari, and that the governments are committed to CEDAW ==== Instances of jirga judicial overreach ==== In January 2018, Basit Mahmood criticized 2017 Pakistan act for Alternative Dispute Resolution saying that it creates scope for a parallel justice system which eventually can undermine states' authority. As per Dilawar Wazir's June 2020 news report in Pakistani news daily Dawn and subsequent editorial, district administration in Pakistan's tribal area was struggling to see one Ahmadzai Wazir tribe avoids to implement its jirga ruling of raising a parallel armed force (lashkar) of around 2400 people to demolish houses of left-leaning political opponents. To make the tribal jirga to submit to a financial compromise, the district administration had to call in elite security force, and make victim submit to demand of 1 million rupees plus four rams as reparation from victim and his clan. As per a June 2020 Tribune Pakistan report, a jirga (a type of quasi kangaroo court) attempted ruling to give up a 13-year-old minor girl in marriage to a 41-year-old married man as Swara (punishment) for her brother's alleged disliked relation with his cousin, the Jirga's attempt was foiled by a close relative of the boy with help of police. In another 2020 June incident in Sindh Pakistan, police struggled to clamp down on a jirga which declared two sisters to be ignoble 'Karis' fined father of the girls for one million rupees plus ordered killing of the sisters (an outlawed but prevalent practice of declaring 'Kari's-literal black spot on honour of the family or community ‚Äì subjectable to severe punishments including honour killing many times for alleged compromising on expectations of modesty and chastity out of suspicions). ==== Historic jirga and women ==== The Sindh High Court imposed a ban on the holding of jirgas in April 2004SBLR 2004 Sindh 918; excerpt because of the sometimes inhumane sentences awarded to people, especially women and men who marry of their own free will. The ban, however, has been ignored.SHC seeks official version against jirgas (2012-12-08) An all-female jirga Khwaindo jirga (\\"sister's council\\") was held in Pakistan, and had 25 members.

His trademark was to slap his mouth with the palm of his hand to create a \\"pop\\" sound. ==Early life and career== Born in Berlin, Germany, Feld began his acting career in Germany in 1917, making his screen debut in Der Golem und die T√§nzerin (The Golem and the Dancing Girl). Feld filmed the sound sequences of the Cecil B. DeMille film The Godless Girl (1929), released by Path√©, without DeMille's supervision since DeMille had already broken his contract with Path√©, and signed with Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer.The Crank Film Series, UCLA, film notes He developed a characterization that came to define him. His trademark was to slap his mouth with the palm of his hand to create a \\"pop!\\" sound that indicated both his superiority and his annoyance. The first use of the \\"pop\\" sound was in If You Knew Susie (1948). Feld often played the part of a ma√Ætre d', but also a variety of aristocrats and eccentrics; his characters were indeterminately European, sometimes French and sometimes Belgian but always with his particular mannerisms. In the 1938 screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby he played the role of Dr. Lehman. In 1939 he appeared with the Marx Brothers in At The Circus in the small but memorable role of French orchestra conductor Jardinet. In one 1967 episode of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., \\"The Napoleon's Tomb Affair\\", Feld played a banker, a beatnik, a diplomat and a waiter. The episode also featured Ted Cassidy from The Addams Family. In his later years, Feld appeared in several Walt Disney films and also played an uncharacteristically dramatic role in Barfly. In addition to films, he acted in numerous television series in guest roles, including the recurring role of \\"Zumdish\\", the manager of the intergalactic Celestial Department Store on Lost In Space, in two Season 2 episodes, The Android Machine and The Toymaker. Zumdish returned in the Season 3 episode Two Weeks In Space, where he has been brainwashed by bank robbers into believing he is a tour director taking the robbers on holiday. He also portrayed one of the Harmonia Gardens waiters in the movie Hello Dolly! (1969). Feld made his final film appearance in 1989. ==Personal life== Feld was married to Virginia Christine who was twenty years his junior and famous for her role as \\"Mrs. Olson\\" in television commercials for Folger's Coffee, from 1940 until his death in 1993 in a convalescent home in Los Angeles, California; Christine died in 1996. The couple are interred at the Jewish Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles. He was the younger brother of the art director Rudi Feld. Feld was a strong enough amateur chess player that 1948 U.S. champion Herman Steiner and international master George Koltanowski would come to his home some evenings in the 1940s, with the three of them playing chess until 6 o'clock the following morning, as mentioned in The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories (Denker & Parr, 1995). ==Partial filmography== *The Golem and the Dancing Girl (1917) as Hotel Page *D√§mon der Welt. 1.

He has been the \\"third man\\" in many championship boxing matches that have taken place in Madison Square Garden in New York City . ==Boxer== As a boxer, he compiled a professional record of 31 wins (11 by way of knockout) and 7 losses in 38 contests. In his career, he faced the likes of Jimmy Young, Chuck Wepner, and Jerry Quarry. He was ranked as high as the #9 contender for the Heavyweight championship. However, after graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, New Jersey with a degree in business in 1975, he decided to retire from boxing. Though he came back for one more bout as a Cruiserweight against Ibar Arrington on April 15, 1977, he retired from prizefighting for good to focus on acting, writing, and a business career. Randy Neumann was elected to the board of directors by the members of the International Boxing Federation at their annual convention, held in Montreal in May 2015. While there, he attended his first board meeting at which time he was elected Treasurer of the organization. Although he no longer referees fights (which he did for 33 years), he now supervises championship fights around the world.

After Condon put in a good word with the New York State Athletic Commission, they started using him as a ringside judge. Before long, he had his first assignment as a referee in a four-round bout at the Felt Forum (a part of Madison Square Garden). Neumann is now a widely respected figure within the boxing community and has worked in the ring for 50+ title fights involving champions including Mike Tyson, Wladimir Klitschko, Meldrick Taylor, Buddy McGirt, Chris Byrd, Evander Holyfield, John Ruiz, and many others. ==Writer== Neumann wrote an article about a fight that he had against Chuck Wepner in Madison Square Garden that was published in the July 1974 issue of Sport magazine. He wrote 13 columns about boxing for the sports section of the New York Times. He wrote stories of boxing The New York Post, The New York News Magazine, Forbes, Signature, Harper's, New Jersey Monthly and other magazines. In 1988 he began writing a financial column for the Hudson Dispatch. Over the years he has syndicated the column in several newspapers.

Hall, was an Australian film producer and director, considered one of the most important figures in the history of the Australian film industry. He was the first Australian to win an Academy Award. ==Early years== Hall was born Kenneth George Hall in Paddington, Sydney, Australia in 1901, the third child of Charles and Florence Hall. He was educated at North Sydney Boys' High School.http://mosman-daily.whereilive.com.au/news/story/lower- north-shores-top-aussie-legends/ At age 15, with the help of his father, he gained a cadetship at the Sydney Evening News, where he became friends with a young Kenneth Slessor, then a cadet for another paper.Ken G. Hall, Directed by Ken G. Hall, Lansdowne Press 1977 p 23 Two years later, he became a publicist for Union Theatres, initially working as an assistant to Gayne Dexter. He had a six-month stint as manager for the Lyceum Theatre then returned to publicity, working his way up to national publicity director, \\"the highest post in film publicity in Australia\\" at that time. In 1924, Hall joined the American distribution company First National Pictures as a publicist, and visited Hollywood the following year. ==Directing career== ===Early years: 1928‚Äì1930=== Hall began making films in 1928 when at First National he was assigned to recut and shoot additional sequences for a German movie about the Battle of Cocos, Our Emden. The resulting film, The Exploits of the Emden, was a local hit. Hall moved back to Union Theatres, running publicity for the State Theatre in Sydney, and working on the campaign against the proposed entertainment tax from Stanley Bruce's government. He eventually became assistant to Stuart F. Doyle, managing director of the company. ===Formation of Cinesound: 1931‚Äì1934=== Doyle established Cinesound Productions to make local films and assigned Hall to direct a number of shorts including Thar She Blows! (1931), about the whaling industry, and That's Cricket (1931). He then gave Hall the job of directing a film adaptation of the popular play On Our Selection, adapted by Bert Bailey from the writings of Steele Rudd about the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, 'Dad and Dave'. Hall persuaded Bailey to reprise his stage performance as Dad Rudd. The result was a massively popular film, which was among the top four most popular films in Australian cinemas in 1932,'\\"ON OUR SELECTION.\\" English Trade Paper Views.', The West Australian (Perth), Thursday 19 January 1933 p 2 earning ‚Ç§46,000 in Australia and New Zealand by the end of 1933.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 158. Hall and Cinesound decided to follow it with another adaptation of a play written by Bailey, The Squatter's Daughter (1933). It was a melodrama set in the Australian bush, and starred a discovery of Hall's, Jocelyn Howarth, who later had a Hollywood career as \\"Constance Worth\\". It was successful at the box office. During this time he made a short documentary Ghosts of Port Arthur (1933). Hall's third feature was The Silence of Dean Maitland (1934), another melodrama based on a play (which had been based on a novel). It starred English stage star John Longden. The film encountered censorship issues but was highly popular. Dean Maitland was released on a double bill with Cinesound Varieties (1934), a short film directed by Hall featuring several musical acts. Hall's fourth feature, Strike Me Lucky (1934), was a vehicle for stage comedian Roy \\"Mo\\" Rene, one of the most popular performers in Australia. It was Hall's first feature that was a film original, and not based on other material. However the film was not well received and Hall later said it was the only one of his movies not to go into profit. ===Middle career: 1935‚Äì1937=== Needing a sure-fire hit, Hall then persuaded Bert Bailey to reprise his role as Dad Rudd in Grandad Rudd (1935), based on a play co-written by Bailey. It was popular, although not as big a hit as On Our Selection. Hall intended to follow this movie with a version of Robbery Under Arms but decided not to proceed because of uncertainty arising from a ban the NSW government had on films about bushrangers. Cinesound ceased production for several months in 1935 to enable Hall to travel to Hollywood and research production methods. Hall returned to Australia with new filmmaking equipment and an American screenwriter Edmond Seward, who was to take over Cinesound's story department. Seward wrote Thoroughbred (1936), a horse racing drama based on the life of Phar Lap. It starred imported Hollywood actor Helen Twelvetrees and was a success. Seward also wrote Hall's next film, Orphan of the Wilderness (1936), the story of a boxing kangaroo. It was meant to be a 50-minute movie in the vein of Cinesound Varieties but Hall decided to expand it to feature length. Hall returned to comedy with It Isn't Done (1937), based on an idea by its star, Cecil Kellaway. It was the first movie Hall made from a script by Frank Harvey, who would write most of his subsequent films. It was also the film debut of Shirley Ann Richards. Richards was the female lead in Hall's next film, Tall Timbers (1937), an adventure tale set in logging country, based on a story by Frank Hurley. ===Comic series: 1938‚Äì1940=== Hall made two films the comic, George Wallace: Let George Do It (1938) and Gone to the Dogs. In between these two he made a third Rudd film, Dad and Dave Come to Town (1938), which featured a performance from a young Peter Finch. Hall gave Finch a bigger role in Mr Chedworth Steps Out (1939), a vehicle for Cecil Kellaway. Hall produced and co-wrote but did not direct Come Up Smiling (1939), a vehicle for Will Mahoney. He made a fourth and final Rudd, Dad Rudd, M.P. (1940), which introduced Grant Taylor. ==World War II== Film production at Cinesound ground to a halt with the advent of World War II, although Hall kept busy during this period producing and directing newsreels, documentaries and short subjects, including Road to Victory (1941) and Anzacs in Overalls (1941). Hall also did shorts with dramatised segments, such as Another Threshold (1942), and short features, 100,000 Cobbers (1942) and South West Pacific (1943). ===Kokoda Front Line (1942)=== His most notable newsreel was the Oscar-winning Kokoda Front Line (1942) ‚Äì the first time an Australian film/documentary was awarded an Oscar. ==Post-War Career== ===Smithy (1946)=== After the war Hall returned to feature film production, enjoying a big success with Smithy, a film biography of Australia's most famous aviator, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, which he produced, co-wrote and directed. This film was financed by Columbia Pictures, who went on to offer its star, Ron Randell, a long-term contract in Hollywood. However, attempts by Hall to make further feature films (particularly an adaptation of the novel Robbery Under Arms, which he later described as \\"the film I wanted to make more than any other\\"Ken G. Hall, Directed by Ken G. Hall, Lansdowne Press, 1977 p93) were not successful, partly because the Greater Union cinema chain, who had backed all of Cinesound's films in the 1930s, were no longer enthusiastic about investing in local production. He was also stymied by the fact that the Australian government refused to allow money over a certain amount to be raised for films.\\"What Happens To Our Films?.\\" The Sunday Herald (Sydney) 3 Feb 1952: 12 accessed 27 November 2011 In particular, an attempt to raise ¬£160,000 to make two films in collaboration with Ealing Studios, including a version of Robbery Under Arms, was refused government permission.\\"AUSTRALIAN film production received two heavy blows last week.

(1948), Fighting Blood (1951), and Overland Adventure (1956). His last documentary was The Kurnell Story (1957). ==Television== In 1956, Hall became general manager for Channel Nine in Sydney, where he remained until 1966.Ken G. Hall at AustLit (subscription required) There he instigated the practice of showing feature films uncut; previously in Australia they had been cut to fit the television schedules.Neil McDonald, \\"Which Version?\\", Quadrant, March 2001, p. 71. ==Later years== On 1 January 1972, Hall was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his services to the \\"Australian motion picture industry.\\"Order of the British Empire, Honour Listing It's An Honour, Australian Government website. Accessed on 9 December 2010. The Australian Film Institute recognised his ability to convey the unique Australian character on film, and his important contribution to the development of the Australian film industry, with a Raymond Longford Award for \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" in 1976. In 1985 he was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. He was a freemason.Famous &/or Notable Australian Freemasons Hall was vocal in his criticism of the Australian New Wave, remarking in 1979, \\"the market for Australian films is flooded with mediocre to weak product. Too many of these films cannot stand up to the competition and will drown.\\" He supported the production of local commercial films, his motto being \\"Give the audience what they want.\\" Hall suffered a stroke in 1993. He died in Sydney on 8 February 1994. He wrote an autobiography, Directed by Ken G. Hall (1977), later updated as Australian Film: The Inside Story (1980). His wife since 1925, Irene Addison, had died in 1972. Hall never remarried.Philip Taylor, 'Ken G.

It was a planned settlement, founded by William Madocks, who bought the land in 1798. The centre of Tremadog was complete by 1811 and remains substantially unaltered. Map of Cardigan Bay View of Tremadog Bay, from the vicinity of Harlech Panorama T. E. Lawrence's birthplace. The house was originally called Gorphwysfa (\\"place of rest\\") before being given the English name of Woodlands. Later it reverted to the original name, albeit using modern Welsh orthography, as Gorffwysfa, but this has more recently been changed to Lawrence House. William Madocks, the designer and builder of most of Tremadog Tremadog hosted an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1872. ==Planning== Tremadog c.1865 By mid-1805, Madocks had already built some houses on the site of Tremadog, for he wrote to the Post-Master at Caernarfon informing him that letters addressed to Pentre-Gwaelod should be delivered to the new houses he had built on Traeth Mawr, near Tan-yr-Allt. Pentre-Gwaelod translates as Bottom Village, but Madocks had grander plans, for aldermen and a mayor had been appointed, and he corrected the word \\"village\\" in a letter written soon afterwards to read \\"borough\\". He planned it himself, perhaps with some help from architectural friends and architectural books, but his letters reveal that a master plan was never produced, as he held the ideas for the settlement in his mind. Tremadog is a good example of a planned town, with an array of Georgian architecture built in the classical tradition of the 18th century. It is located immediately below the high ground of Snowdonia and on the edge of the modern Snowdonia National Park. Tremadog was built on flat land reclaimed from Traeth Mawr, the estuary of the Afon Glaslyn, and to enhance its appearance Madocks placed the Market Square, the centre of his project, just in front of a great crag of rock, the former edge of the estuary. It towers some over the Town Hall, and the coaching inn, giving a theatrical effect to the area. He hoped to attract more buildings that fitted his overall plan, but this plan failed and he eventually funded most of them himself. The main streets were named Dublin Street and London Street, as Madocks wanted Tremadog to be a stopping off point on the main route from London to Porth Dinllaen on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula, which was intended to be the chief port for ferries to Dublin. However, this plan failed when Holyhead supplanted Porth Dinllaen as the main ferry port. He was keen that everything should enhance the village's appearance ‚Äî his main interest. Unlike some contemporary town planners, he was less interested in the moral reform of the inhabitants: he felt that people had the right to work, educate their children, pray, drink, gamble, save or waste money as they saw fit; and that the town should give its residents opportunities to get on with their own lives, providing that they were congenial neighbours. The Town Hall or dancing room was a large first-floor room at the head of the square. Five round arches supported the front of the building, and the ground floor was used as a market hall. The dancing room had a fireplace at both ends, a minstrels' gallery on the back wall, and five large sash windows at the front, overlooking the square. It was reached by stairs from the tap room in the adjacent public house so that people attending a dance did not have to pass through the market area. The roof was in a similar style to many of Madocks' buildings, with a shallow pitch of slates, and wide eaves, while a flight of steps ran across the front of the building, creating a plinth on which it stood. There were six medallions and five keystones on the front of the building, with representations of theatrical figures. During August, the market space became a theatre. The house to the east of the town hall was quite shallow, allowing a stage to be built behind it, connected to the market space by a proscenium arch. Madocks wrote several stirring prologues and a play for the theatre, and there are rumours that the playwright and poet Sheridan acted in a production of his own play The Rivals there, although it was probably his son Tom, who was a contemporary of Madocks. ==Church and chapel== Madocks believed that \\"in education and religion all ought to have fair play\\", and this was reflected in the provision of a Gothic revival style church for the Anglicans and a classical chapel for the Methodists. His approach did not find favour with the Bishop of Bangor, but he defended his decision by telling the Bishop that the church would be built on rock, while the chapel would be built on sand. This was true geologically, but was also a reference to the Biblical parable of the wise and foolish builders. The church was built on a rocky outcrop, which had once been an island in the estuary, and was one of the first churches to be built in Gothic revival style in Wales. The tower supported a spire, built in brick which was rendered with Parkers Roman Cement. It deceived the antiquarian Richard Fenton, who described it as yellow freestone in his book of travels published soon after 1813. The entrance to the churchyard is spanned by a decorative arch of Coade stone, a ceramic material manufactured in Lambeth, London, which is in Gothic horror style, with representations of boars, dragons, frogs, grimacing cherubs, owls, shrouded figures and squirrels, while the tops of the towers are surrounded by elephants' heads. Madocks wanted it to become a parish church, but it was only ever a chapel of ease, as Tremadog was part of the parish of Ynyscynhaearn. The population of the parish as a whole in 1841 was 1,888.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III, (1847) London, Charles Knight, p.1,019 Although he provided a churchyard, no burials took place, but it was one of the few buildings in the region where services were regularly conducted in the English language. The church was fitted with box pews, cast iron windows with coloured glass, and a blue ceiling with stars painted on it. There was a crypt, the precise location of which is unknown, in which Madocks hoped to be buried, but he died in Paris and was buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. He is commemorated by a brass plaque, which also commemorates the wedding of Mary Madocks to Martin Williams there in 1811. John Williams, originally a gardener from Anglesey, who worked tirelessly to complete Madocks' plans when he was so often away, was buried in the vault when he died in 1850, as were his wife and their only son, W T Massey Williams. Music was supplied by a small barrel organ, but it was not adequate and was moved to Ynyscynhaearn, where it is still in the gallery. A replacement was bought from Bates of Ludgate Hill in 1857. In 1898, the chancel floor was raised, and the windows were replaced. A new roof was fitted in the 1950s, and the ceiling was removed, while the spire was repaired with cement in the 1970s. The building ceased to be used for worship in 1995 and was eventually bought by Cyfeillion Cadw Tremadog, a trust dedicated to the repair and refurbishment of the historic buildings of Tremadog, in 2005. The fabric was repaired, and modern facilities installed. An upper floor was fitted, and the building was subsequently used as offices by Cartrefi Cymru (\\"Homes of Wales\\"), a charity which assists disabled people living in the community. Repair of the coadestone arch, requiring the manufacture of several replacement parts, was completed in 2007. In December 2017, Ffestiniog Travel will move into the church.http://www.myrailtrip.co.uk/FfestiniogTraveleMail214.htm Peniel Chapel, which was built by the Methodists, and was one of the first buildings to be completed in the settlement, was quite unlike most Welsh chapels. On the outside, it looked like a Greek temple, while inside the pulpit was on the end wall rather than the more traditional long side wall. Methodists had begun a Sunday School in a house in 1805, and in 1808 Madocks gave them the land on a 99-year lease, subject to a peppercorn rent. It was completed in two and a half years ‚Äî 18 months before the church ‚Äî and the first service was led by Thomas Charles from Bala. Since Madocks and his family were there, he conducted the service in English, and the two men became friends, with Charles often visiting Tan-yr-Allt, where Madocks lived. The front facade, with a large circular window, was not completed until 1849, and the work was supervised by John Williams, Madocks' agent, who continued to serve the community long after Madocks' death in 1828. As the congregation grew, galleries were built in 1840 and 1880, and extensive plasterwork was added between 1908 and 1910. The chapel is one of only five grade I listed nonconformist chapels in Wales, and it was hoped to refurbish it for the bicentenary in 2010. ==Governance== There is a separate electoral ward called Porthmadog-Tremadog. This ward includes some of the community of Porthmadog but also measures Beddgelert. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 1,257. ==Industry== In the early 1800s, there was a thriving woollen industry, supplying garments to South Carolina and other southern states of America, the West Indies, South America, and Russia, but it was a cottage industry. One of Madocks' first projects was to build a factory where wool could be processed on an industrial scale. Although there were a few sites in Wales where the fulling of cloth was powered by water, this was one of the first woollen mills where water power was used for carding and spinning. The building was located close to his home at Tan-yr-Allt, because the high ground behind it provided a good head of water. It had a characteristic shallow-pitched slate roof, and Madocks instructed that the walls should be yellow, and the windows painted dark green. Nearby were a corn mill and a fulling mill. The water was provided by building a dam across a small valley, to form Llyn Cwm Bach, with sluices channelling the water to feed the mill and the factory. Although Madocks initially employed a Mr Fanshawe to manage the factory, he was not happy with his performance, and soon the project was being managed by John Williams, Madocks' assistant. The building was advertised for sale in 1810, and from 1835 was used as a tannery. It still stands but has a temporary roof. In the 1990s, the Tremadog Buildings Preservation Trust obtained permission for its repair and conversion but failed to acquire the site. ==Houses== Most of the houses of Tremadog were of a similar plan, and in common with townhouses of the period, opened directly onto the square. They had a central doorway, with a parlour or a shop on each side, and there were two bedrooms on the upper floor. Shops were not a common feature of Welsh villages at the time, but the Mayor opened a general store, which was supplied from London, and Madocks instructed his assistant to look out for a shoemaker, a tailor, a butcher and a weaver. At the back of the houses, there was a lean-to scullery, running across the full width of the buildings. For the two inns, the nature of the reclaimed land prevented the digging of a dry cellar, and in this case, half of the scullery was replaced by a structure with a stone vaulted roof, which helped to regulate the internal temperature. Evidence of this can be seen in the bar of the Golden Fleece Inn in the village centre. Ty P√¢b was the end of the first phase of the building on the road leading to the church, originally called London Road, but subsequently renamed Church Street. Arches on the side of the building mark the planned location of a cross street, which was never built. The ordinary houses were supplemented by several gentlemen's villas, of which T≈∑ Nanney is a good example in the village itself, while Tan-yr-Allt, where Madocks lived, was situated to the east of the village centre. ==Education== 'Ysgol y Gorlan', a primary school, is the only school in Tremadog. It is a state school which caters for 120 pupils between the ages of three and eleven. Most of the leavers go to 'Ysgol Eifionydd', the nearest secondary school, in Porthmadog. ==Canal== Madocks enlarged a drainage ditch to the river Glaslyn to form a canal which was opened in about 1815. It was used for 35 years to carry copper ore from a local mine, before being replaced by a tramline. ==Tourism== Tremadog is an increasingly popular tourist destination. The area's long, quiet roads attract motorcyclists, and Tremadog also has a good quality rock climbing \\"crag\\" (another has been closed because of rock instability) which attracts climbers from all over the UK. There have been issues with access to the crags, with local farmers and the Nature Conservancy Council trying to prevent climbing, but one section, Craig Bwlch y Moch, has been owned by the British Mountaineering Council since 1979. Deteriorating conditions led to annual events to tidy up the climbs between 2007 and 2010, and negotiations with the Forestry Commission resulted in invasive sycamore trees being removed in 2009. A further event was held in April 2012, but a climber was injured in May 2012 when huge blocks of rock were dislodged during a climb. Tremadog also boasts one of the country‚Äôs most iconic chapels. Peniel, a Calvinist Methodist chapel, was finished in 1810 and then expanded after Construction work, with its eye-catching and unusual columns, finishing in 1849, its temple front loosely based on St Paul‚Äôs chapel in Covent Garden, London. The design of the building went on to influence how other chapels in Wales during the period were built, But the site was forced to close in 2015 as its dwindling congregation was unable to keep it open, it is set to be rejuvenated, funds pending. Below these crags is a cafe, campsite and bunkhouse, which provides a base for climbers. === Culture === Tremadog is a thriving Welsh-speaking village, where the language is in everyday use. ==Famous residents== * Tremadog was the birthplace of T.

The company was formed on February 1, 1937, by the nationalization and merger of Lior√© et Olivier, Potez, CAMS, Romano and SPCA. ==History== Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry, the government of L√©on Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry. The act provided for the creation of seven nationalized aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich). SNCASE incorporated the facilities of Potez in Berre-l'√âtang, CAMS in Vitrolles, Romano in Cannes, SPCA in Marseille and Lior√© et Olivier at Argenteuil and Marignane. SNCASE became the largest of the aeronautical ', with of space in six factories and employees. ( of the workforce came from Lior√© et Olivier, along with 90% of then-current manufacturing contracts.) In 1941, during the Second World War, the Paris design bureaus of both the nationalized and the private aircraft firms were relocated to avoid capture. SNCASE acquired the failing SNCAM and moved its engineering operations to SNCAM's headquarters at the former Dewoitine factory in Toulouse. During the rationalisation of the nationalised Aircraft Industry during the 1950s, SNCASE merged with SNCASO to form Sud Aviation on March 1, 1957, which in turn was later amalgamated into A√©rospatiale and eventually the EADS group. ==Products== Most early Sud-Est aircraft retained their earlier designations, such as the Lior√© et Olivier LeO 451 bomber. The first aircraft produced under the Sud-Est marque was the Sud- Est SE 100http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=1512&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= (formerly Leo 50) fighter. As well as fixed winged aircraft work, SNCASE carried out research into rotary-winged aircraft capitalising on the experience gained from absorbing the Liore et Olivier team which had license- built the Cierva C.30 design (as the LeO C.30 and C.301 to C.305 variants), and designing and building the LeO C.34 (derived from Kellett designs). After World War II further work on autogyro's produced the SE.700http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9552&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= and SE.700A multi-seat Liaison autogyros, which were quickly over-shadowed by the rapid development of helicopters. SNCASE continued experimenting with helicopters with the help from a team from Focke Achgelis building the SE.3000, which was a French version of the twin-rotor Focke Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, and the smaller, more conventional, SE.3101. With this experience SNCASE went on to design the SE.3110 and eventually the SE.3120 Alouette which first flew on 21 July 1951 and broke the helicopter distance and speed records in July 1953. Production versions of the Alouette emerged as the commercially successful Alouette II and Alouette III, resulting in production runs of several hundreds, with many exported. Fixed wing aircraft were also developed post World War II, with several jet research aircraft and two significant airliners: The SE-2010 Armagnachttp://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=609&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= and the SE-210 Caravellehttp://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9058&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= airliners. Production licences were also obtained from de Havilland for the de Havilland Sea Venom to provide all-weather and day fighters for the A√©ronautique Navale., with 121 two-seat and single-seat Aquilon 20 / 201 / 202 / 203 / 204 built from 1952.http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9862&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;=http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9073&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;=http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9863&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= ===SNCASE aircraft production=== * SNCASE SE.100 * SNCASE SE-116 Voltigeur * SNCASE SE-117 Voltigeur * SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc * SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite * SNCASE SE-210 Caravelle * SNCASE SE.212 Durandal * SNCASE SE-400 * SNCASE SE-532 Mistral * SNCASE SE-535 Mistral * SNCASE SE-700 * SNCASE SE-700A * SNCASE SE-1010 * SNCASE SE-1210 * SNCASE SE-2010 Armagnac * SNCASE SE-2100 * SNCASE SE-2300 * SNCASE SE-2310 * SNCASE SE-2410 Grognard I * SNCASE SE-2415 Grognard II * SNCASE SE-2418 Grognard * SNCASE SE-2421 Grognard * SNCASE SE-3000 * SNCASE SE-3101 * SNCASE SE-3110 * SNCASE SE-3120 Alouette * SNCASE SE-3130 Alouette II * SNCASE SE-3131 Gouverneur * SNCASE SE-3150 Llama * SNCASE SE-3160 Alouette III * SNCASE SE-3200 Frelon * SNCASE SE-5000 Baroudeur * SNCASE SE-5003 Baroudeur * SNCASE Aquilon ==References== ==External links== * Aviafrance - S.N.C.A.S.E. * Aviafrance - S.N.C.A.S.E.

She is played by Peri Gilpin. Roz is the producer of Frasier Crane's Dr. Frasier Crane Show on KACL 780 AM. Although initially reluctant to take the job, she and Frasier soon become good friends. ==History== The character is named as a tribute to a producer of the television series Wings (having the same creators as Frasier), who died from breast cancer in 1991. The role of Roz initially went to Lisa Kudrow but was recast before the pilot, and Kudrow was replaced by Gilpin. ==Background and role in the series== Early in the series, Roz and Frasier have a rather strained relationship. But as the show goes on, they become very close, often consoling each other through hard times. Nevertheless, the teasing, sardonic element continues through their friendship. Roz becomes friends with Frasier's father Martin. She is the only regular character to address him as \\"Marty.\\" While Frasier and Niles are interested in high culture, Roz and Martin share a more down-to-earth view of life. Roz is often invited to join Martin's poker games, which his own sons are not. In one episode when Roz drops by Frasier's apartment, Martin greets her by asking, \\"Hey, Roz, how's my girlfriend?\\" Roz is also close to Martin's physical therapist Daphne Moon, as they are the only two women who are constant in the Crane men's lives. They become best friends, and Daphne invites Roz to be a bridesmaid at her wedding to attorney Donny Douglas. She is also invited to be the maid of honor at Daphne's wedding to Niles; however, Daphne elopes with Niles in Reno, Nevada, and Roz is not present for their real wedding. Roz has an antagonistic relationship with Frasier's brother Niles early in the series; she teases him about his effete mannerisms and snobbery, while he teases her about her so-called abundance of partners. Their mutual bickering fades gradually as the series progresses, and they become quite friendly. Roz also defends Niles when he has a nervous breakdown. Roz was born in 1964 and is originally from Bloomer, Wisconsin. Her mother Joanna (Eva Marie Saint) was a longtime politician there and serves as Attorney General. Ironically, the Attorney General of Wisconsin during most of the run of the show was named Jim Doyle. name=\\"hereslookingatyou\\"> She has a sister, Denise, whom she resents for her supposedly perfect life. Roz's parents are divorced, and she ends her relationship with her father when he starts dating a woman younger than she. Her maternal grandmother was an immigrant from Ireland. Frustrated with small-town Wisconsin, Roz moved to Seattle as an adult to pursue a career in radio and worked in the industry for about 10 years before joining Frasier. Roz is portrayed as a professional woman with an active sex life, which is the subject of male jokes and snide remarks, especially from Frasier's brother Niles. Roz worries about her appearance as she ages, and is concerned that she will never fall in love and get married. She has a brief fling with a co-worker, Bob \\"Bulldog\\" Briscoe (much to her later chagrin). In one episode, it is revealed that, like Sam Malone, Roz has a \\"black book\\" containing the names and numbers of her previous male partners. Early in the fifth season, Roz discovers that she is pregnant with the child of a 20-year-old college student with whom she had a brief fling. By the end of the season, Roz gives birth to a girl, whom she names Alice. Late in the ninth season, Roz finally manages to maintain a seemingly stable relationship with Roger, a city trash collector, but they break up when they see that their relationship chemistry isn't right. Frasier consoles her, and this eventually leads them to sleep together. Roz subsequently flees home to Wisconsin, while Frasier chases after her in an attempt to remedy the situation. Frasier ends up posing as Roger, whom the Doyle family had been very excited to meet, although previously being a bit skeptical that Roger was not merely a falsehood constructed by Roz (due to Roz's romantic history). It is here that Roz and Frasier reconcile, and agree to remain friends. In the show's final episode, Roz becomes station manager of KACL after the previous manager, Kenny Daly, decides to become a DJ again. ==References== Category:Frasier characters Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin Category:Fictional radio personalities Category:Television characters introduced in 1993 ","title":"Roz Doyle"},{"id":"1298808","text":"use both this parameter and birth_date to display the person's date of birth, date of death, and age at death) -->  death_place =  death_cause =  body_discovered =  resting_place =  resting_place_coordinates =  burial_place =  burial_coordinates =  education = Ngee Ann Polytechnic  occupation =  years_active = 1969‚Äìpresent  spouse =  partner =  children = 1 Tam Hiu-fung (Ë≠öÊõâÈ¢®)  parents = Tam Kong-pak (Ë≠öÊ±üÊüè)Sina. \\"Sina.com.\\" Ë≠öË©†È∫üÔºöÊàëÁöÑÁà∂Ë¶™Ë≠öÊ±üÊüè‰∏Ä-Áà∂Ë¶™ÁÇ∫ÊàëË≤∑Ë∂≥ÁêÉ.

Its first display was on 14 May 1952 over Copacabana beach, using the North American T-6 Texan. The team used the T-6 from its formation until 1968, when it switched to the French A√©rospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister jet, called T-24 in FAB service. However, this model proved unsuitable to Brazilian conditions and, in 1972, the squadron reverted to the T-6, which was used until 1977. The EDA was disbanded in 1977, but reformed on 8 December 1983 using Neiva T-25 Universal piston-powered aircraft, soon to be replaced by the then-new Embraer EMB-312 Tucano turboprop trainer. At the time the EDA's aircraft were painted a bright red scheme, which has since been superseded by the current gloss blue. ==Aircraft== The aircraft used by the EDA have been, in chronological order: * North American T-6 Texan for 1225 displays; * A√©rospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister for 46 displays; * Neiva T-25 Universal for 55 displays; * Embraer EMB-312 Tucano with more than 2000 displays as of 2010; * Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano, being the two first ones delivered on September 30, 2012.

She also played the shingled lady in John Galsworthy's 1927 Broadway production Escape. ==Early years== Born in Edinburgh, Inescort was the daughter of Scots-born journalist John \\"Jock\\" Wrightman and actress Elaine Inescourt, who was of German and Polish descent. They married in 1926 but parted ways when their daughter was still a young child. While she lived in Britain, Inescort wrote for a newspaper in London and worked as secretary to Lord Astor. (Another source says that she was secretary to Lady Astor.) After going to the United States, she not only acted but also worked as associate editor of The Exporter's Encyclopedia. ==Stage== Inescort's acting debut came in The Truth About Blayds (1922), which was presented at the Booth Theatre on Broadway. Her other Broadway credits include You and I (1923), The Woman on the Jury (1923), Windows (1923), The Fake (1924), Ariadne (1925), Hay Fever (1925), Love in a Mist (1926), Mozart (1926), Trelawny of the \\"Wells\\" (1927), Escape (1927-1928), Napi (1931), Company's Coming (1931), Springtime for Henry (1931-1932), When Ladies Meet (1933), False Dreams, Farewell (1934), Lady Jane (1934), Soldier's Wife (1944-1945), The Mermaids Singing (1945-1946) and You Never Can Tell (1948). ==Film== Frieda Wrightman adopted her mother's surname as her professional name and moved to Hollywood and made her film debut in The Dark Angel (1935).

In 1955 Inescort appeared as Mrs. Lawrence in the movie Foxfire starring Jeff Chandler and Jane Russell. She appeared in one episode of Perry Mason as Hope Quentin in \\"The Case of the Jealous Journalist\\" (season 5, 1961). ==Personal life== On 2 August 1961, she and her husband since 1926, Ben Ray Redman, dined out. Redman had been despondent for some time. Returning home before her, he went upstairs to bed. He then called Frieda, informing her that he was depressed over the state of the world and had taken 12 sedative pills. By the time the paramedics arrived, he had died, a suicide at the age of 65. He had been working as a writer for the Saturday Review and was involved in the translation of European classics into English. Inescort had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1932. Her disease accelerated after her husband's death, and she was using a wheelchair by the mid 1960s. On 7 July 1964, her estranged mother, British actress Elaine Inescourt, died in Brighton, England, aged 87. Frieda worked as much as possible for the funding of multiple sclerosis research. She was often seen in the Hollywood area seated in her wheelchair, collecting donations outside supermarkets and in malls. ==Death== Inescort died at the age of 74 at the Motion Picture Country Home at Woodland Hills, California from multiple sclerosis. ==Partial filmography== * The Dark Angel (1935) - Ann West * If You Could Only Cook (1935) - Evelyn Fletcher * The Garden Murder Case (1936) - Mrs. Fenwicke-Ralston * The King Steps Out (1936) - Princess Helena * Mary of Scotland (1936) - Mary Beaton * Hollywood Boulevard (1936) - Alice Winslow * Give Me Your Heart (1936) - Rosamond Melford * The Great O'Malley (1937) - Mrs. Phillips * Call It a Day (1937) - Dorothy Hilton * Another Dawn (1937) - Grace Roark * Portia on Trial (1937) - Portia Merriman * Woman Doctor (1939) - Dr. Judith Randall Graeme * Beauty for the Asking (1939) - Flora Barton- Williams * The Zero Hour (1939) - Linda Marsh * Tarzan Finds a Son!

He received a B.A. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1977, and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980. ==Research contributions== Goldman has investigated geometric structures, in various incarnations, on manifolds since his undergraduate thesis, \\"Affine manifolds and projective geometry on manifolds\\", supervised by William Thurston and Dennis Sullivan. This work led to work with Morris Hirsch and David Fried on affine structures on manifolds, and work in real projective structures on compact surfaces. In particular he proved that the space of convex real projective structures on a closed orientable surface of genus g > 1 is homeomorphic to an open cell of dimension 16g-16. With Suhyoung Choi, he proved that this space is a connected component (the \\"Hitchin component\\") of the space of equivalence classes of representations of the fundamental group in {\\\\rm SL}(3,\\\\R). Combining this result with Suhyoung Choi's convex decomposition theorem, this led to a complete classification of convex real projective structures on compact surfaces. His doctoral dissertation, \\"Discontinuous groups and the Euler class\\" (supervised by Morris W. Hirsch), characterizes discrete embeddings of surface groups in {\\\\rm PSL}(3,\\\\R) in terms of maximal Euler class, proving a converse to the Milnor‚ÄìWood inequality for flat bundles. Shortly thereafter he showed that the space of representations of the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus g>1 in {\\\\rm PSL}(3,\\\\R) has 4g-3 connected components, distinguished by the Euler class. With David Fried, he classified compact quotients of Euclidean 3-space by discrete groups of affine transformations, showing that all such manifolds are finite quotients of torus bundles over the circle. The noncompact case is much more interesting, as Grigory Margulis found complete affine manifolds with nonabelian free fundamental group. In his 1990 doctoral thesis, Todd Drumm found examples which are solid handlebodies using polyhedra which have since been called \\"crooked planes.\\" Goldman found examples (non- Euclidean nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds) of closed 3-manifolds which fail to admit flat conformal structures. Generalizing Scott Wolpert's work on the Weil‚ÄìPetersson symplectic structure on the space of hyperbolic structures on surfaces, he found an algebraic-topological description of a symplectic structure on spaces of representations of a surface group in a reductive Lie group. Traces of representations of the corresponding curves on the surfaces generate a Poisson algebra, whose Lie bracket has a topological description in terms of the intersections of curves. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian vector fields of these trace functions define flows generalizing the Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen flows on Teichm√ºller space. This symplectic structure is invariant under the natural action of the mapping class group, and using the relationship between Dehn twists and the generalized Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen flows, he proved the ergodicity of the action of the mapping class group on the SU(2)-character variety with respect to symplectic Lebesgue measure. Following suggestions of Pierre Deligne, he and John Millson proved that the variety of representations of the fundamental group of a compact K√§hler manifold has singularities defined by systems of homogeneous quadratic equations. This leads to various local rigidity results for actions on Hermitian symmetric spaces. With John Parker, he examined the complex hyperbolic ideal triangle group representations. These are representations of hyperbolic ideal triangle groups to the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane such that each standard generator of the triangle group maps to a complex reflection and the products of pairs of generators to parabolics. The space of representations for a given triangle group (modulo conjugacy) is parametrized by a half-open interval. They showed that the representations in a particular range were discrete and conjectured that a representation would be discrete if and only if it was in a specified larger range. This has become known as the Goldman‚ÄìParker conjecture and was eventually proven by Richard Schwartz. ==Professional service== Goldman also heads a research group at the University of Maryland called the Experimental Geometry Lab, a team developing software (primarily in Mathematica) to explore geometric structures and dynamics in low dimensions. He served on the Board of Governors for The Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota from 1994 to 1996. He served as Editor-In-Chief of Geometriae Dedicata from 2003 until 2013. ==Awards and honors== In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-19. ==Publications== * * ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page at the University of Maryland, College Park Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century mathematicians Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Maryland, College Park faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Topologists Category:Differential geometers Category:People from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Mathematicians from Missouri Category:Princeton University alumni ","title":"William Goldman (mathematician)"},{"id":"1298825","text":"Mohammad-Javad Ardeshir Larijani (; born ) is an Iranian conservative politician, mathematical logician, and former diplomat. He is currently a top adviser to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in foreign affairs and secretary of High Council for Human rights, Judiciary of Islamic Republic of Iran. He has been a key planner of Iran's foreign policy, and led the ceasefire negotiations after Iran‚ÄìIraq War. ==Early life and education== Mamad Larijani was born to Iranian parents and is a brother of Ali Larijani, the current chairman of the Parliament and Sadegh Larijani, the current chief justice. Larijani is a cousin of Ahmad Tavakkoli, who is the current director of Majlis Research Center. Larijani, raised in a religious family, graduated from a hawza before starting his higher education in electrical engineering in Aryamehr University, wearing the uniform for the full four years. He later continued his studies outside Iran, in the Ph.D. program in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917720,00.html Although there are reports that he has not finished his studies in Berkeley. According to Allyn Jackson, Larijani may have received his PhD from Berkeley in 1980 under the supervision of Robert Vaught. Although it is certain that he has indeed been a graduate student at Berkeley, it is not clear whether he has received his Doctorate degree.http://www.ams.org/notices/200708/tx070801002p.pdf He is a professor at Imam Sadegh University and Sharif University of Technology. ==Career== Larijani is one of the top advisors to the supreme leader and the head of the human rights council in the judiciary. The council rejects and condemns appointment of Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran by United Nations and strongly opposes the western countries' positions about current human rights situation in Iran. Iran has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations, most recently after the November 2019 protests. The UN Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed \\"The Special Rapporteur is shocked at the number of deaths, serious injuries and reports of ill-treatment of persons detained during the November 2019 protests. According to reports, detainees are being tortured or are suffering other forms of ill-treatment, sometimes to extract forced confessions. There are also reports of denials of medical treatment, including for injuries caused by the excessive use of force by the security forces, with some other detainees being held incommunicado or being subjected to enforced disappearance. He is concerned about reports that families of individuals killed by the security forces have been threatened not to speak out. He remains highly concerned about the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression.\\" Additionally Larijani has been the director of Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics in Tehran. Previously, he was a Majlis representative and the director of Majlis Research Center. He served as deputy minister of foreign affairs in the 1980s. ===Views=== In a 2010 NBC News interview, Larijani defended the arrest of Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian feminist activist, and a prominent human rights lawyer. Sotoudeh was detained in September and faces trial for \\"collusion against national security\\" and \\"spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic.\\". Larijani told NBC News that Iranian authorities believed that she was engaged \\"in a very nasty campaign\\" against Iran's national security. Nasrin Sotoudeh works for Shirin Ebadi's law firm. Shirin Ebadi is the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

She is considered one of the leading contemporary Romanian authors. She took her name after Blandiana, near Vin»õu de Jos, Alba County, her mother's home village. In October 2017, she was announced as The Griffin Trust For Excellence In Poetry's twelfth recipient of their Lifetime Recognition Award. ==Literary career== Coman's parents were Gheorghe (1915-1964), an orthodox priest and former member of the fascist Iron Guard who spent years in Communist prisons and died in an accident weeks after his release in a general amnesty, and Otilia (Diacu), an accountant. Her sister Geta was born in 1947. In 1960 she married the writer Romulus Rusan. After her debut in 1959, in Tribuna, Cluj, where she signed for the first time as Ana Blandiana, she was published in the anthology 30 de poe»õi tineri (\\"30 Young Poets\\"). In 1963, after a four-year interdiction due to her father's status, she again published in Contemporanul (edited by George Iva»ôcu). Her editorial debut took place in 1964 with the booklet of poems Persoana √Ænt√¢ia plural (\\"First Person Plural\\"), with a Foreword written by Nicolae Manolescu. She became known for her Calc√¢iul vulnerabil (\\"Achilles' Heel\\", 1966) and A treia tainƒÉ (\\"The Third Secret\\", 1969). In 1966, Blandiana appeared for the first time at the International Poem Contest (in Lahti, Finland). In 1967, she settled in Bucharest; until the following year, she was one of the editors for Via»õa studen»õeascƒÉ, and then (until 1975) worked as editor for Amfiteatru. She gave two televised readings in 1969, in the company of Andrei »òerban and the actors Irina Petrescu, Mariana Mihu»õ, and Florian Pitti»ô. Between 1975 and 1977, she was a librarian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest. In 1976, her works were first printed in a French translation, in Croisi√®re du Club des Po√®tes by :fr:Jean-Pierre Rosnay (Paris); in 1978, she took part in the First International Festival of Poetry in Paris organized by the famed Club des Po√®tes. In the late 1980s, assuming risks of reprisals by the communist regime, Blandiana started writing protest poems, in answer to the increasingly harsh demands of the system in general. In 1984 Blandiana's poem 'Totul' ('Everything') was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. 'Totul' was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania. In 1987 she published at the Sport-Turism Publishing House the book \\"Ora»ôe de silabe\\" (\\"City of syllables\\") where she writes about all the countries and cities of the world where she traveled in spite of the communist dictatorship: over 100. The same year, 1987, she is published in USSR, at Raduga Publishing House from Moscow, with the Russian title Stihotvorenia, rasskaz√Æ, asse. Even though the secret services of Ceau»ôescu ('Securitate') attribute her a dissident status, in 1989 the Minerva Publishing House is publishing in the most popular mass collection \\"Biblioteca Pentru To»õi\\" (\\"Library for all people\\") an anthology of her poems. Her friends sustain that the book never seen the bookshelves of the libraries. However, \\"Poezii\\" (\\"Poems\\") has a 'Foreword' written by Eugen Simion. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, she entered political life, campaigning for the removal of the communist legacy from administrative office, as well as for an open society. She left literary work in the background, although she did publish Arhitectura valurilor (\\"Waves' Architecture\\", 1990), 100 de poeme (\\"100 Poems\\", 1991), and Sertarul cu aplauze (\\"The Drawer of Applause\\", prose, 1992). In 1992 she advocates for the released from prison of old time Party member Gheorghe 'Gogu' Radulescu, a former member of the Executive Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and protector of herself during the communist period. Ana Blandiana has also published: 50 de poeme, (\\"50 Poems\\"), 1970: Octombrie, Noiembrie, Decembrie (\\"October, November, December\\"), 1972; √ént√¢mplƒÉri din grƒÉdina mea (Occurrences in My Garden), 1980; Ora de nisip (\\"The Hour of Sand\\"), 1984; √ént√¢mplƒÉri de pe strada mea (Occurrences on My Street), 1988; √én diminea»õa de dupƒÉ moarte (\\"On the Morning After Dying\\"), 1996; La cules √Ængeri (\\"Angel Gathering\\"), 1997; Cartea albƒÉ a lui Arpagic (\\"Arpagic's White Book\\"), 1998. She has also authored 6 books of essays and 4 books of other prose writings. Her work was translated into 16 languages.

He is also guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the pop group Imperial Teen, best known for their 1999 single \\"Yoo Hoo\\" used in the movie Jawbreaker. In addition to popular musical career, Bottum also scored three Hollywood movies and composed an opera entitled Sasquatch: The Opera, which premiered in New York on April 2, 2015. ==Career== Joining his schoolfriends Billy Gould and Mike Bordin in Faith No More in 1981 (replacing Wade Worthington), Bottum remained in the band until its demise in 1998. However, after 1992's Angel Dust and its ensuing tour, Bottum's input into Faith No More was reduced significantly. His keyboards, previously prominent in the band, were almost absent on King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime (1995). Bottum later explained that he suffered a nervous breakdown in this era and \\"all of that [time] is a real blur for me.\\" He was addicted to heroin and also experienced the death of his father and saw the aftermath of Kurt Cobain's suicide on Courtney Love (Cobain's wife and Bottum's close friend, and also an early singer for Faith No More). In 1994 and 1995, Bottum formed Imperial Teen with Lynn Perko, another Bay Area music veteran. The band's mainstream pop sound was a stark contrast to the aggressive metal of Faith No More, and is perhaps best known for their single \\"Yoo Hoo\\", used in the 1999 film Jawbreaker. In 2009, Bottum returned to Faith No More for a reunion tour and in 2015 the band released their seventh studio album Sol Invictus. In 2013, Bottum moved to New York City and produced an opera called Sasquatch: The Opera. He wrote the music and libretto for the piece about the elusive beast of the forest, describing it as a dark and gothic fairy tale about a backwoods family and the relationship between a caged woman and Sasquatch. The opera premiered in Brooklyn in 2015 and went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the summer of 2016 for a month of shows. Bottum also wrote a short form opera called The Ride about the AIDS LifeCycle Ride, a charity bicycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a ride Bottum participated in twice. The piece was staged with two stationary bicycles onstage. In 2016, Bottum joined the art music collective Nastie Band. The group features an 85 year old singer Chris Kachulis and Bottum's long time friend visual artist, Frank Haines. In 2018, Bottum made his acting debut in Sebastian Silva's feature film Tyrel about racial tension in America. The ensemble cast features Jason Mitchell, Chris Abbott, Michael Cera, and Caleb Landry Jones. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and had a theatrical release through Magnolia Pictures in 2019. Also in 2019, Bottum formed the band Crickets with JD Samson and Michael O'Neil. In 2020, Bottom released the song \\"Daddy\\" under the name Man on Man, with partner Joey Holman. ==Scoring== Bottum composed the music for Craig Chester's gay romantic comedy film Adam & Steve (2005) \\"Roddy Bottum teams with Courtney Love on Adam & Steve soundtrack \\" - The Advocate March 18, 2005 and scored What Goes Up (2009). He also composed the music for the 2007 film Kabluey starring Lisa Kudrow and Scott Prendergrast. Bottum scored Gigantic, a film by Matt Aselton, starring Zooey Deschanel and Paul Dano in 2007. In 2010, he scored the documentary Hit So Hard about drummer Patty Schemel. In 2010 Bottum also scored Fred: The Movie for Nickelodeon. He has gone on to score the sequel to that film and the first season of Fred: The Show for the same network. ==Personal life== Bottum revealed his homosexuality in a 1993 interview with Lance Loud for The Advocate. In a 2001 interview in The Advocate, Bottum stated that \\"I would never have thought as a gay teen I'd be in a band that would be considered heavy metal or hard rock.\\" One of his contributions to Faith No More was \\"Be Aggressive,\\" a song about oral sex. A 1999 article in The Advocate said of Imperial Teen, \\"With lyrical allusions to wearing lipstick and male pronouns used to address love objects, Imperial Teen serves up a gay sensibility that ordinarily surfaces only from straight bands like Pulp or Pizzicato Five.\\" Bottum noted \\"I think there's a resistance from gay artists to go that route just because it's so predictable. But it is annoying to see bands play it as safe as they do these days. That's why something that visually screams as loud as Marilyn Manson is such a breath of fresh air.\\" Before he came out as gay, Bottum was actually involved in a brief heterosexual relationship with Courtney Love in the early 1980s, concurrent with the time she sang for Faith No More. The two remain friends decades later. ==Discography== ==References== ==External links== * Soundtrack.net interview July 22, 2001 * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Alternative rock guitarists Category:Alternative rock keyboardists Category:Alternative rock singers Category:American alternative rock musicians Category:American heavy metal keyboardists Category:American male singers Category:American rock singers Category:Faith No More members Category:Gay musicians Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:LGBT people from California Category:Guitarists from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American keyboardists Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American keyboardists ","title":"Roddy Bottum"},{"id":"1298867","text":"Peach Melba (, pronounced ) is a dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice cream. It was invented in 1892 or 1893 by the French chef Auguste Escoffier at the Savoy Hotel, London, to honour the Australian soprano Nellie Melba.Avey, Tori. \\"Opera, Escoffier, and Peaches: The Story Behind the Peach Melba\\", August 22, 2012, accessed 9 April 2015 == Creation of the dessert == In 1892, operatic soprano Nellie Melba was performing in Wagner's opera Lohengrin at Covent Garden. The Duke of Orl√©ans gave a dinner party to celebrate her triumph. For the occasion, Escoffier created a new dessert, and to display it, he used an ice sculpture of a swan, which is featured in the opera. The swan carried peaches which rested on a bed of vanilla ice cream and which were topped with spun sugar. In 1900, Escoffier created a new version of the dessert. For the occasion of the opening of the Carlton Hotel, where he was head chef, after he had been quietly sacked from the Savoy for embezzlement along with the CEO, Escoffier omitted the ice swan and topped the peaches with raspberry pur√©e. == Variations == Other versions substitute pears, apricots, or strawberries instead of peaches or use raspberry sauce or melted redcurrant jelly instead of raspberry pur√©e. The original dessert used simple ingredients of \\"tender and very ripe peaches, vanilla ice cream, and a pur√©e of sugared raspberry\\". Escoffier himself is quoted as saying, \\"Any variation on this recipe ruins the delicate balance of its taste.\\" ===Pijama=== Peach Melba is claimed to be the ancestor of the pijama, a dessert in Catalan cuisine. 7 Portes, a famous restaurant in Barcelona founded in 1836, is credited with its creation in 1951, when officers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the nearby harbor would often dine at 7 Portes and order Peach Melba for dessert. The name mutated to pijama (, Catalan for pajamas) among the Catalan-speaking kitchen staff. From there the recipe, or the essence of it, spread throughout Catalonia. Variations are countless, but ice cream, flan, and fruit in syrup (peach and/or pineapple) are its staple ingredients. Though regarded as an extravagant and somewhat outdated dish today, the pijama was considered part of the corpus of the Catalan cuisine and its recipe was included in the inventory published by the Foundation of the Catalan Institute of Cuisine and Gastronomical Culture. ==Cultural significance== In tribute to Escoffier an elaborate deconstruction of the peach Melba was served as the last dish at elBulli prior to its closure in 2012. ==See also== * List of foods named after people * Melba toast ==References== Category:Food and drink introduced in the 1890s Category:Frozen desserts Category:Fruit dishes Category:Vanilla ice cream Category:Peaches Category:Nellie Melba Category:French desserts ","title":"Peach Melba"},{"id":"1298868","text":"Three vessels of the United States Navy have been named USS Venture: * The first was a steam yacht leased by the Navy from 1917 to 1919. * The second was also a yacht, originally built in 1931, acquired at the end of December 1941, used for patrols and convoys along the East Coast, and sold in 1946. * The third was a minesweeper in service from 1956 to 1971.

The sole standalone episode of the show's original run (apart from the 1983 feature-length anniversary special The Five Doctors, which was later shown in a multi-episode form) it serves as an introduction to the 12-part story The Daleks' Master Plan. It is also unusual for the complete absence of the regular cast, including the Doctor (although William Hartnell is still credited on-screen). The story focuses on Space Security Agent Marc Cory (Edward de Souza) and his attempts to warn Earth of the Daleks' latest plan. Although audio recordings and production stills of the episode exist, no footage is known to have survived. ==Plot== ===Synopsis=== On the planet Kembel, Marc Cory and Gordon Lowery of UN Deep Space Force Group 1 attempt to repair their spaceship to reach their rendezvous when they are attacked by their crew member Jeff Garvey, who was in a violent state of mind upon waking up in the jungle. Cory shoots Garvey dead when he was about to fire at Lowery, pulling out a long thorn from behind his ear. Bringing Lowery into the spaceship for debriefing, Cory explains himself to be a Space Security agent assigned to investigate a possible Dalek base for universal invasion with the presence of a Varga plant confirming their presence. Outside, Garvey gradually mutates into a Varga. At the Daleks' base, Dalek Supreme is informed that the representatives from the seven planets will soon arrive while sending a Dalek platoon to destroy Cory and Lowery. Cory stands guard against the slow-moving Varga plants while Lowery finishes building a rescue beacon. They notice a spaceship flying above them, Cory deducing the Daleks are planning something big. As Lowery was about to record a message, Cory notices something moving in the jungle, ducking behind some bushes. The Dalek platoon arrives and destroys their ship with Lowery accidentally stabbing his hand on a Varga thorn as he and Cory flee. In the Dalek base, the representatives from the seven galaxies have gathered in a conference room. Dalek Supreme assures representative Malpha that the human intruders will be dealt with. Cory is forced to kill Lowery upon learning he became infected and records a message, only to be surrounded by the Daleks and exterminated before he could launch the beacon. Back at the Dalek base, the representatives all approve in forming an alliance with the Daleks' plan to take over the Solar System while chanting \\"Victory.\\" ==Production== Episode is missing The episode came about because producer Verity Lambert wanted to give the cast regulars an extra week's holiday between the second and third production blocks, extending their break from five weeks to six, and so it was decided to make the final episode in serial T a one-off story introducing elements of the forthcoming story The Daleks' Master Plan (Serial V) without including any of the regular actors.Howe-Stammers-Walker, Doctor Who: The Handbook: The First Doctor (London: BBC Book, 1994), pp. 280‚Äì81, 285. The episode was made by the same team as Galaxy 4 (Serial T), with both stories sharing pre-filming. It was also the final Doctor Who episode on which Verity Lambert served as producer.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/54qDh7ZH3RyLZYyN4KFPq4l/the- fourth-dimension Terry Nation wrote this episode partially as an attempt to create a story about the Daleks that did not involve the Doctor or his companions, so that he could eventually develop and sell the idea of a Dalek series, divorced from the Doctor Who universe. In the proposed series, the Space Security Service was tasked with hunting Daleks, and it would follow their adventures‚Äîan approach that can be seen in short stories and comic strips written for the 1965 Dalek Outer Space Book (cover dated 1966). An unmade pilot titled The Destroyers was written, but the series concept was never sold. ===Alternative titles and production codes=== Perhaps more than any other Doctor Who story, \\"Mission to the Unknown\\" generates confusion and debate over both the title used and the serial/production code allocated. All Doctor Who stories from this period have no overall on-screen title, with the story referred to either by a production code or an internal title by the production team. (For example, the early 1965 story featuring Nero was Serial M or The Romans.) The two were confusingly used interchangeably in many production and overseas sales documents. \\"Mission to the Unknown\\" generates further confusion because some documents do not refer to it as a serial but rather as a \\"cutaway episode\\". As the story was produced alongside Galaxy 4 the two appear to have been referred to together. Several of the production codes offered are either Serial T or Serial T +, an appendage. The camera script calls the episode \\"Doctor Who: Mission to the Unknown\\", but in the left margin the words \\"Dalek Cutaway\\" are typed. A handwritten addition on the front sheet states \\"Serial T Episode 4\\" (which actually is the production code for the episode from the week prior).Andrew Pixley, \\"A Question of Answers,\\" TSV 53 (March 1998) In the Programme as Broadcast document, the episode is titled \\"Dalek Cutaway ‚Äì Mission to the Unknown\\". No production code appears. In a production memo provided to the new producer John Wiles, dated May 1965 and called \\"The History of Doctor Who\\", the episode is called \\"Serial DC\\". In a design document dated 9 July, the episode is referred to as \\"T/A Episode 1\\", and in another dated 20 July, it is called \\"Serial T, Episode 5\\". A publicity document held in the BBC Written Archives refers to the serial as \\"The Beasts from UGH\\", as does a photograph in the Getty Archives. In 1969, when the videotape of the episode was due to be wiped (although this did not actually happen until July 1974), the relevant paperwork referred to it as \\"Serial Ta Episode 1/1\\". When it came to offering the story for sale overseas, the synopsis sent by BBC Enterprises gave the title as \\"Mission to the Unknown (Dalek Cutaway)\\". The 1974 Enterprises document A Quick Guide to Doctor Who, which listed the stories produced so far for potential overseas buyers, gave the title as \\"Dalek Cutaway (Mission to the Unknown)\\" and did not offer any production code at all. When fans started compiling reference books in the mid-1970s, it was this latter document which formed the basis of many lists. The story was referred to alternatively as \\"Dalek Cutaway\\" and \\"Mission to the Unknown\\" on many occasions, whilst the production code went vacant until the discovery of the design documents stating T/A. ===Cast notes=== This is the only Doctor Who story that does not feature the TARDIS or the character of the Doctor. Despite this, William Hartnell is still credited as \\"Dr. Who\\"‚Äîthis was because his contract specified he would be credited for all episodes, including those in which he appeared only in the reprise or did not feature at all. The Doctor's companions Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) and Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) do not appear either. Unlike Hartnell, their contracts did not guarantee they would be credited, though they were in the BBC listings magazine Radio Times (and episode guides taking their information from there). The alien delegates seen at the Daleks' HQ on Kembel would return in The Daleks' Master Plan, but recast with some make-up and costume changes and with a notably different line-up including some speaking characters, leading to some confusion over which is which. The disparity only came to light when the Master Plan episode \\"Day of Armageddon\\" was returned to the BBC archives. Barry Jackson had previously appeared as Ascaris in The Romans and would appear as Drax in The Armageddon Factor (1979). Jeremy Young had previously played Kal in An Unearthly Child (1963). Edward de Souza would later play Mortimer Davey in the audio play The Roof of the World. ===2019 remake=== Students at the University of Central Lancashire recreated the episode with the involvement of Peter Purves, Edward de Souza and Nicholas Briggs in 2019. The episode premiered on the Doctor Who YouTube channel at 5:45pm BST on 9 October, exactly 54 years after it first aired. ==Commercial releases== ===In print=== The story was novelised as part of The Daleks' Master Plan I: Mission to the Unknown by John Peel, published in September 1989. The rest of the book contained an adaptation of the first six episodes of The Daleks' Master Plan. An unabridged reading of the book by Peter Purves and Jean Marsh, with Dalek voices supplied by Nicholas Briggs, was released by BBC Audiobooks in May 2010. The title was slightly modified to Daleks ‚Äì Mission to the Unknown. ===Home media=== This story is one of three (the others being Marco Polo and The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve) to survive in audio form only, with no broadcast footage of any form currently known to exist. The audio was released as part of the soundtrack CD The Daleks' Master Plan. A reconstruction of the episode was produced by Loose Cannon Productions in 2000, using set photographs and the existing audio. ==References== * By Any Other Name ‚Äì Article by Andrew Pixley detailing the problems of early Doctor Who story titles. ==External links== * * Category:First Doctor serials Category:Dalek television stories Category:Doctor Who missing episodes Category:1965 British television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Terry Nation Category:Fiction set in the 4th millennium ","title":"Mission to the Unknown"},{"id":"1298873","text":"Nelahozeves is a municipality and village in Mƒõln√≠k District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,100 inhabitants. It lies on the left bank of the Vltava river, 35 km north of Prague. ==History== The oldest surviving written document mentioning Nelahozeves dates to 1352. The village has a three-winged Renaissance chateau in the Italianate Northern Mannerist style, featuring elaborate sgraffito designs that depict scenes from Greek mythology and the Old Testament. The castle is an example of the castello fortezza, a design that was considered very modern in the 16th century. Its predominant characteristics are faux architectural defenses, including decorative bastions and an entry bridge without a moat. The most noteworthy of the castle's interior rooms is the Knight's Hall, which dates from 1564. Dominated by a large Renaissance stone fireplace, it also features ceiling decorations depicting Livy‚Äôs interpretations of five Roman virtues, wall frescoes displaying military figures, and a lunette vault decorated with original stucco reliefs. Construction on Nelahozeves Castle began under the orders of Florian Griesbeck von Griesbach, a Tyrolean aristocrat and adviser to Emperor Ferdinand I, who commissioned the building from royal master builder Bonifaz Wolmut. The castle took more than sixty years to build and was completed at the beginning of the 17th century, more than a decade after Florian's death. However, financial difficulties forced the von Griesbach family to sell the castle to Polyxena, 1st Princess Lobkowicz (1566‚Äì1642), in 1623. The castle was severely damaged during the Thirty Years' War, but was reconstructed by V√°clav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz (1609‚Äì1677), who used the castle as the center for administration and management of his estates. However, the castle never served as the Lobkowicz family's primary residence. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was home to the Order of the Sisters of God's Love, a religious institution for widowed or unmarried noblewomen founded by Princess Wilhelmina Lobkowicz (1863‚Äì1945). Nelahozeves Castle was confiscated by the Communist government in 1948, and housed an exhibition of modern socialist art run by the Czech Regional Gallery in the 1970s and 80s. It was returned to the Lobkowicz family in 1993, and now features an exhibition of historical period rooms, demonstrating the lifestyle of a Bohemian noble family in the mid-19th century. The castle also houses part of the Lobkowicz collection of paintings. Birthhouse of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k ==Notable people== The 19th-century composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k was born in Nelahozeves in 1841, and lived there until the age of 13. In his childhood home, also owned by the Lobkowicz family, the National Museum operates a small museum focusing on his life. ==References== ==External links== *Basic information about the town (in English) *Nelahozeves Castle Category:Villages in Mƒõln√≠k District ","title":"Nelahozeves"},{"id":"1298878","text":"Project Phoenix is an ongoing programme within the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to revive its Reserve Force and bring it on a par with the Regular Force under a \\"One Force policy.\\" The aim is to reach a point whereby members of the Reserve Force can be easily substituted for those of the Regular Force for combat operations, thus easing the requirement to sustain a large Regular Force.

This idea was based on stories of his late grandfather that had been passed down. He stated \\"We become like gods to those who come after us.\\" With this in mind he created a Minecraft mod, Chain World, that was put on a single USB flash drive, which he then passed to an audience member. The rules of the game were simple: No text signs are allowed in the game, players may play until they die once, upon respawning they must quit the game and the game must then be passed onto someone that is interested and willing to respect the rules. ==GDC 2013 Game Design Challenge== In March 2013 the Game Design Challenge was held at the Game Developers Conference for the final time.

They make visits to cities, factories and other areas of human activity, seemingly to merely float and observe. All attempts at communication are unsuccessful and despite the best efforts of mankind, no one is able to decipher their intentions. Some, however, have come in to close encounter with the aliens, and emerged dramatically altered beings. These people, called humanity-prime, and dubbed 'primeys', are highly intelligent, can bend matter to their will, but are also, by human standards, quite, quite mad. Algernon Hebster is a highly successful businessman, owing mostly to his dealings with primeys, who supply him with the knowledge for advanced technologies which he puts to use in commerce. The problem is that primeys are so dangerous that dealing with them is highly illegal and every attempt is made to confine them to the reservations around their perceived alien masters. ===\\"Time in Advance\\"=== (Galaxy Science Fiction, August 1956) ====Plot==== In the far future a law is passed enabling citizens to serve out sentences for crimes they intend to commit, serving the full term, but with a 50% pre- criminal discount. Post-criminals and pre-criminals alike are sent to carry out hard-labour on hellishly perilous, far-flung Convict Planets. Few return. Those pre-criminals who are not killed, drop out before their terms are up, with nothing but scars and nightmares to show for their troubles. Two pre- criminals however, 'Blotto' Otto Henck and Nicholas Crandall, manage against all the odds to serve out two full terms for murder, and return to Earth as minor celebrities, with the right to kill one person each. Things, however, do not go quite as planned. Blotto Otto has his scheming wife in mind, only to find out she died the previous year in an unfortunate accident. For Crandall, whose life has been a perpetual series of failures, things go even worse. He intends to kill Frederick Stephenson, a man who stole his great invention. However, on his return, he receives a call from his terrified beloved ex-wife, who thinks she is his intended victim for her series of infidelities whilst they were married. Next he receives a call from his ex-business partner, pleading for his life because he thinks he is the intended victim for secretly cheating him out of vast sums of money. Crandall was previously unaware of either of these things. Still reeling, he meets his own brother, who thinks he is the intended victim, and reveals it was he with whom his wife was cheating. Finally, he calls his intended victim, Stephenson, the only one who fails to twist and squirm, but instead offers Crandall fair settlement for his invention. Shattered by the day's events, Crandall succumbs to the fact that he is one of life's born losers, and sets out with Otto to have some fun.\\"Time in Advance\\" at the Internet Archive ===\\"The Sickness\\"=== (Infinity Science Fiction, November 1955) ====Plot==== The Earth finds itself on the brink of catastrophic nuclear war between Russia and the United States. As a last-ditch symbolic gesture of peace and cooperation, the two nations, presided over by India, launch a joint manned venture to Mars. On their arrival to the red planet, Nicolai Belov, a Russian member of the crew, discovers a vast and amazing city once populated by human-like beings. However, once he returns to the ship he quickly develops a strange fever and is quarantined. This raises tensions in the already fraught atmosphere on board, and threatens to throw power amongst the crew out of balance. Equilibrium is restored, however, when American crew member Smathers also comes down with what is now dubbed Belov's disease. One by one the crew succumb, falling through several stages of fever and delirium, leaving prospects of return ever slimmer, and prospects of war on Earth ever greater: Mutual suspicion over the loss of the mission would trigger the final conflict. Soon just one man remains healthy, American astronaut O'Brien. Just when he thinks all is over, Belov and Smathers awake from their fevers, only they aren't quite the same. They have acquired super- human powers and intelligence, able to shape matter at will and communicate telepathically. O'Brien discovers that Belov's isn't a disease at all, but a fantastic symbiotic bacilli. Just when he realises that the problems of the Earth are over and a new era has dawned, Smathers reveals one final thing: Some people, like him, are naturally immune...

Five present individuals have been selected to travel to the future, while five compatible individuals have been selected to travel to the past. The compatibility of each time traveler to one traveling in the opposite directions is described as vital to the method, without a perfect balance of travelers it is impossible. The story opens when the present day travelers find themselves stranded in the future. The problem is the oldest of them, Winthrop, refuses to return to the past thus leaving all of them trapped. In the present he was merely a bum, but in the future he's a curio and encouraged to indulge his tastes to the point of gluttony. Each of them is forced to confront the part of the future they find the most distasteful. The first, an elderly lady, has to meet with Winthrop and plead with him to release them by returning. The scientist has to attend the great computer to seek advice on the situation, which he finds morally objectionable. In any case, the computer tells him to simply return to the others, as the story concludes with a twist.\\"Time Waits for Winthrop\\" at the Internet Archive ==Reception== Anthony Boucher received the collection enthusiastically, describing the two novellas included as \\"models absolute of extrapolative with and insight\\" while finding the shorter stories \\"of almost comparable quality.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, September 1958, p.98. ==Adaptations== The story \\"Time in Advance\\" was adapted in 1965 by Paul Erickson as one of twelve episodes of the first series of BBC anthology series Out of the Unknown.

He also played for the Birmingham Stallions in the United States Football League (USFL). An integral part of Buffalo's offense during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Norwood kicked in the team's first two Super Bowl appearances. Despite his accomplishments, he is best known for missing a game-winning field goal attempt at the end of Super Bowl XXV. ==Early life and college== Norwood was born in Alexandria, Virginia and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria in 1978.*Greenfeld, Karl Taro, \\"A Life After Wide Right,\\" Sports Illustrated, July 12, 2004 He played both football and soccer at James Madison University and graduated with a business degree in 1982. ==Professional career== ===Birmingham Stallions=== Norwood began his professional career with the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League, playing two seasons before the Stallions signed Danny Miller to replace him. ===Buffalo Bills=== Norwood was one of many players the Bills picked up as the USFL contracted and ultimately collapsed; he eventually beat out Todd Schlopy (who would later come back when Norwood went on strike in 1987) for the Bills' starting kicker position. He quickly became an asset to an offense that was going places as the Bills' general manager, Bill Polian, assembled talent like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, and, on defense Bruce Smith. Within two seasons of Norwood's arrival, the Bills had won the AFC East for the first time since 1980 and made it to the conference championship game. He soon overtook O.J. Simpson as the team's all-time leading scorer. Following the 1990 season, the Bills advanced to their first-ever Super Bowl. ====Super Bowl XXV==== Norwood's field goal range was unusually short for a professional kicker and he had difficulties in converting field goals over 40 yards throughout his career, especially on natural grass (the Bills' home stadium used AstroTurf, which mitigated this issue). Super Bowl XXV, which was played on January 27, 1991, cemented Norwood's name in football history when he missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 8 seconds left in the game, giving the New York Giants their 2nd Super Bowl victory, and started the Bills' string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses. This kick was made famous by the \\"wide right\\" call by the TV announcers. Although the Bills signed Bj√∂rn Nittmo as Norwood's potential replacement in the 1991 offseason, Norwood remained with the Bills through that season. The Bills returned to the Super Bowl and Norwood was perfect throughout the postseason, including a 44-yard field goal that served as the decisive margin in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos. Norwood was waived in the first roster move of the off-season after the Bills signed Steve Christie, formerly of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.A Life After Wide Right, p. 4. ==Post-football career== After the Bills waived him, Norwood initially returned home to Northern Virginia and disappeared completely from public eye for several years, eventually becoming an insurance salesman during the 1990s then moving back to Buffalo as a real estate agent in 2002.A Life After Wide Right, p. 5. ==Personal life== Following Super Bowl XXV Norwood suffered from severe depression. He filed for divorce a year later. His ex-wife Kimberly moved to the Washington, D.C. suburb of Centreville, Virginia. They have three children: twins Carly and Connor (born 1995) and Corey (born 1996). ==In popular culture== In the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, a key plot point involves a kicker for the Miami Dolphins named Ray Finkle; in the story, Finkle misses a field goal attempt in the closing moments of Super Bowl XVII, causing the Dolphins to lose the game by a single point - an obvious reference to Norwood's infamous kick in Super Bowl XXV. (In reality, Super Bowl XVII was contested between the Dolphins and the Washington Redskins; the Redskins won 27-17.) The 1998 film Buffalo '66 features a subplot where main character Billy Brown, played by Vincent Gallo, attempts to murder a former Buffalo kicker named \\"Scott Wood\\", whose missed field goal led to Brown losing a large bet and serving a prison term when he took the fall for his bookie. ==References== *Paul Jannace, \\"Norwood‚Äôs life after football is business as usual\\" www.wellsvilledaily.com, March 29, 2010 Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football placekickers Category:Birmingham Stallions players Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:James Madison Dukes football players Category:People from Centreville, Virginia Category:Players of American football from Virginia Category:Sportspeople from Alexandria, Virginia ","title":"Scott Norwood"},{"id":"1298898","text":"Catelyn Stark (n√©e Tully), or Cat to family and close friends, is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. She is a prominent point of view character in the first three novels. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Catelyn is the wife of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, the Warden of the North and mother to five of his children Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon, but resents his bastard son Jon Snow. She was born into House Tully of Riverrun, the lord paramount clan of the Riverlands, as the oldest child of Lord Hoster Tully and Lady Minisa Whent, and has two younger siblings ‚Äî sister Lysa and brother Edmure. Catelyn is portrayed by Northern Irish actress Michelle Fairley on the HBO series Game of Thrones. American actress Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and appeared in the unaired pilot, but left the series for family reasons before the first season began, and Fairley was cast as a replacement with the character's scenes in the pilot remade. Fairley's portrayal has garnered critical acclaim, with many in particular praising her performance during the episode \\"The Rains of Castamere\\".Game of Thrones: Michelle Fairley is shunned by the Emmy Awards, but the show picks up 17 nominations (Yahoo TV UK) Due to this popularity, many fans were disappointed she did not appear in the series' fourth season, despite the character's resurrection in the novels. ==Character description== Catelyn Stark is described as beautiful, with fair skin, long auburn hair, blue eyes, long fingers, high cheekbones and full breasts, and dressed simply in the grey color of House Stark or the blue and red of her father‚Äôs House Tully. She is proud, strong, kind and generous, has a strong grasp of politics, and is often governed by the desire to protect her children. Catelyn is usually in accord with her husband Eddard Stark, but resents his admission of his extramarital son Jon Snow into their household. Catelyn was originally betrothed to Eddard's older brother Brandon, the heir to Winterfell at the time. When Brandon was sadistically executed by King Aerys II, Lord Jon Arryn, who was the guardian of Eddard and Robert Baratheon, rebelled against House Targaryen. Soon after the rebels won the Battle of the Bells, Catelyn was married to Eddard, having never met the new groom before the wedding day, to consolidate the alliance between the Riverlands and the North. She was initially disappointed as Eddard is shorter and less handsome than Brandon, but later fell in love with Eddard after seeing the \\"good sweet heart beneath his solemn face\\". ==Storylines== ===Book series=== ====A Game of Thrones==== After the royal party arrives at Winterfell, Catelyn receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn stating that the Lannisters had killed her husband Jon Arryn, the king's 'Hand' (second-in-command). King Robert Baratheon persuades Eddard to take his place. When her son Bran is injured and goes into a coma, she sits by his bed until they are attacked by an assassin who has come to kill Bran. Catelyn is wounded in the attack, and travels to King's Landing to warn Eddard after recovering. There, her childhood companion Petyr Baelish tells her that the dagger used in the attack belongs to Tyrion Lannister. On her way back to Winterfell, she takes Tyrion to her sister at the Eyrie for trial, where Tyrion escapes execution by demanding and winning a trial by combat. After the news of Eddard's execution by order of King Joffrey reaches Catelyn, she argues for peace, but is overruled by the newly crowned King Robb and his bannermen. ====A Clash of Kings==== Catelyn advises against Robb's plan to send Eddard's former ward, Theon Greyjoy, to forge an alliance with Balon Greyjoy. Catelyn is sent by Robb to attempt an alliance with Renly Baratheon and his massive Reach-Stormlands host. Catelyn meets Renly at Bitterbridge and follows his host to the ancestral Baratheon seat of Storm's End, where she witnesses first the unsuccessful parley between Renly and his older brother and rival claimant Stannis, and then Renly's subsequent murder later that night by a shadow creature. Afterwards, Catelyn flees with Brienne of Tarth, one of Renly's kingsguard, to Riverrun. Upon hearing of her younger sons' supposed murder at the hands of Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn goes to confront the captive Jaime Lannister. Although the novel ends her storyline ambiguously, it is revealed at the beginning of the third novel that Catelyn set him free and asked Brienne to escort him to King's Landing in an attempt to exchange him for her daughters, who were still captives of Joffrey. This, however, causes problems for Robb and costs him an ally, House Karstark, which had held grudges against the Lannisters. ====A Storm of Swords==== Catelyn's brother Edmure Tully places Catelyn under house arrest at Riverrun, but Robb pardons her after he announces his wedding to Jeyne Westerling, invalidating his marriage proposal to House Frey. Lord Walder Frey agrees to forgive Robb if Edmure marries his daughter Roslin, and Catelyn travels to the Frey seat of the Twins to attend the wedding with Robb and other northern lords. However, Walder Frey and his men take revenge on Robb for his slight on their house by slaughtering the northern host, an act of treachery that became known as the \\"Red Wedding\\". In an attempt to save her son's life, Catelyn takes Aegon Frey hostage and kills him when Roose Bolton kills Robb regardless, but she still has her throat slashed by Raymund Frey. The Freys then mutilate Robb's corpse, and throw Catelyn's stripped naked corpse into the Green Fork in mockery of House Tully's tradition of river burial. Three days later, Catelyn's body is washed ashore downstream along with hundreds of other corpses, and a wolf pack led by Arya Stark's stray direwolf Nymeria is drawn to scavenge upon the dead. However, Arya is skinchanging into Nymeria at the time during her sleep, recognizes her mother's body, controls Nymeria to pull it out of the river and guards it against other wolves until the outlaw band Brotherhood Without Banners passes by to repel the wolves. Catelyn is then resurrected by Lord Beric Dondarrion, who sacrifices his life force to revive her in repayment to her husband Eddard's honoring. However, the period of time she spent deceased has caused Catelyn's body to partly decay, disfiguring her looks; furthermore, upon her reanimation she loses most of her previous kind personality, except for her hatred of the Lannisters and the Freys. Catelyn then assumes command of the Brotherhood, and changes their aim to terrorizing anyone related to House Frey and Lannister. Her uncompromising brutality earns her the moniker \\"Lady Stoneheart\\". ====A Feast for Crows==== Stoneheart and the Brotherhood come across a small party led by Brienne, who informs Stoneheart that she is searching for Sansa at Jaime Lannister's request. Stoneheart names Brienne a traitor because she carries Oathkeeper, a Lannister sword that was forged from Ned Stark's Valyrian steel blade, Ice. Brienne swears that she is still faithful, but Stoneheart insists she must prove it by killing Jaime, whom she believes played a role in the Red Wedding. Brienne refuses, even when threatened with a hanging. Just before Brienne is to be hanged, she shouts out a word. ===Family tree of House Tully=== ===Television series=== In January 2007 HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin's series for television. Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and filmed her scenes in the unaired pilot until she eventually left for family reasons. Michelle Fairley was then cast in the role, which she played for three seasons. Catelyn's storyline diverges from the book following the Red Wedding in that she never reappears as Lady Stoneheart. Fairley's performance has received critical acclaim. Time wrote about \\"The Rains of Castamere\\": \\"Michelle Fairley‚Äôs fantastic performance captures the horror, with the edge of desperation, anguish, and madness of a woman who has lost her sons (she believes all of them), lost her grandchild, may have lost her daughters, and for all she knows, is witnessing the extinction of the house she belongs to...\\". The closing scene of \\"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\\" was praised by HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, highlighting Michelle Fairley's acting as Catelyn gathers allies to arrest Tyrion. == References == Category:A Song of Ice and Fire characters Category:Fictional assassinated people Category:Female characters in literature Category:Female characters in television Category:Literary characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements Category:Fictional lords and ladies Category:Fictional outlaws Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Fictional undead ","title":"Catelyn Stark"},{"id":"1298902","text":"Saddleback College (commonly referred to as Saddleback) is a public community college in Mission Viejo, California.

His father, Amulya Sarkar, worked as a tailor, while his mother, Anjali Sarkar, was a State and later Provincial government employee. Sarkar became active in student movements in his student days, and in 1968, at the age of 19, he became a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was a candidate of the Students' Federation of India throughout his academic life at MBB College, from where he graduated with a B. Com. degree. During his first year at the college there came the turbulent times of the food movement of 1967, campaigning against the policy of the then Congress government of Tripura, and Sarkar threw himself headlong into the related student struggle. His vigorous role in this mass movement led him to join the Communists. Due to his early political exposure, he also became the General Secretary of the MBB College Student Union and was also made the Vice President of the Students' Federation of India. In 1972, at the early age of 23, he joined the State Committee of the Communist (Marxist) Party. ==Political career== Six years after being selected in the CPI (M) State Committee, Sarkar was included in the party state Secretariat in the year 1978. This was also the year when the first Left Front government had taken control in Tripura. In 1980, at the age of 31, he was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly from the Agartala constituency. This was the start of Manik Sarkar's leadership in his state. At around the same time, he was appointed as the Chief Whip of the CPI (M). His success as the Member of the Legislative Assembly returned in 1983, when he was elected to the Assembly from Krishnanagar, Agartala. When the Left Front government took control in 1993, Sarkar was appointed as the State Secretary of the CPI (M). The biggest success came to Sarkar in 1998. At the age of 49, he became a member of the politburo of the CPI (M), which is the principal policy-making and executive committee in a Communist party. In the same year, he became the Chief Minister of the state of Tripura. Since then, he was elected to the same position for four consecutive times in 20 years He is one of the very few chief Ministers in India who were in the office for so long. His party lost majority in the 2018 elections and he had to step down as a result. ==Personal life== Sarkar is married to Panchali Bhattacharya, who was employed with the Central Social Welfare Board till she retired in 2011. Sarkar and his wife live a very simple life. Sarkar is the only Indian Chief Minister who does not own a personal car or a home. He chooses to live in an old and a very small house that belonged to his great grandfather. He used to donate his entire salary that he received as a Chief Minister to his party and in return, got 10,000 (approximately $155 USD) per month as allowance. == See also == * Manik Sarkar ministry (2013‚Äì2018) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Bengali people Category:Communist Party of India (Marxist) politicians from Tripura Category:Tripura politicians Category:Chief Ministers of Tripura Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:People from Gomati district Category:Chief ministers from Communist Party of India (Marxist) Category:Members of the Tripura Legislative Assembly Category:12th Tripura Legislative Assembly members Category:Leaders of the Opposition in Tripura ","title":"Manik Sarkar"},{"id":"1298951","text":"In social justice, internalized oppression is a concept in which an oppressed group uses the methods of the oppressing group against itself. It occurs when one group perceives an inequality of value relative to another group, and desires to be like the more highly-valued group. Members of marginalized groups may have an oppressive view of their own group, or affirm negative self-stereotypes. Internalized oppression may manifest on an individual or group level, and may result in conflict or discrimination within the group.David, E. J. R. and Annie O. Derthick. \\"What Is Internalized Oppression, and so What?.\\" Internalized Oppression: The Psychology of Marginalized Groups., E. J. R. David and E. J. R., (Ed) David, Springer Publishing Co, 2014, pp. 1‚Äì30.

It may also exist among immigrants and their descendants. If the host community devalues a foreigner's ethnic origin, native language or culture, an immigrant may feel inferior. This can lead to self-hatred, which manifests itself in an exaggerated conformity to dominant norms. An immigrant may also respond by assimilating and acculturating. ==Types== Internalized racism occurs when a member of a group which is a target of racism assumes a racist attitude towards their own group. It indicates a lack of self- esteem.Szymanski, Dawn M. and Arpana Gupta. \\"Examining the Relationship between Multiple Internalized Oppressions and African American Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Questioning Persons' Self-Esteem and Psychological Distress.\\" Journal of Counseling Psychology, vol. 56, no. 1, Jan. 2009, pp. 110‚Äì118. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1037/a0013317. Internalized racism is an effect of internalized colonialism, in which a colonized people loses its identity and assumes the values of the colonizing society; it may happen gradually, over a long period of time. An example of internalized colonialism is the practice of skin whitening (see colorism) found in the Africa and Asia. Internalized homophobia, also known as internalized heterosexism, occurs in the LGBT community when individuals adopt a culture's heterosexual norms. It has a positive correlation with psychological distress, and a negative correlation with self-esteem. Internalized homophobia is strongly associated guilt and shame (especially among youth) and has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and suicide.Puckett, Jae A., et al. \\"Predictors of Sexual Minority Youth's Reported Suicide Attempts and Mental Health.\\" Journal of homosexuality, vol. 64, no. 6, 2017, pp. 697‚Äì715. In internalized sexism, individuals (generally women) adopt oppressive attitudes towards their gender which are held by their culture. An example is slut-shaming, where women criticize transgressions of accepted codes of sexual conduct on themselves and other women.Armstrong, Elizabeth A., et al. \\"'Good Girls': Gender, Social Class, and Slut Discourse on Campus.\\" Social Psychology Quarterly, vol. 77, no. 2, June 2014, pp. 100‚Äì122. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1177/0190272514521220. A range of internal oppression may occur when an individual belongs to more than one oppressed groups; a woman of color may experience internalized racism and internalized sexism, or a person of color may be homosexual (and also experience internalized homophobia). ==Causes== Internalized oppression \\"occurs when a person comes to internalize oppressive prejudices and biases about the identity group(s) to which he or she belongs\\". It occurs when \\"[s]ocial oppression such as racism, sexism, ableism, classism, heterosexism, gender and religious oppression, and anti-Semitism\\" are \\"implanted by and [work] toward the benefit of any dominant group. Internalized oppression \\"depends on systemically limiting, blocking, and undermining\\" the \\"success, innovation, and power\\" of oppressed individuals or groups. Some individuals will copy (and internalize) \\"institutionalized rejection of difference,\\" failing \\"to examine the distortions which result from ... misnaming [these differences] and their effects on human behavior and expectations.\\" ==Effects== \\"If women are surrounded by people who view them as subordinate, incapable, or lacking control over their actions, women are likely to come to understand themselves in a similar way, even if subconsciously.\\"Liebow, Nabina. \\"Internalized Oppression and Its Varied Moral Harms: Self-Perceptions of Reduced Agency and Criminality.\\" Hypatia, vol. 31, no. 4, Fall2016, pp. 713‚Äì729. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/hypa.12265. Internalized oppression fosters the beliefs that the self cannot be autonomous, is unworthy of wielding power, and is little more than an object of sexual gratification (see sexual objectification). \\"Psychological oppression can be damaging to a person's moral relationship with the self ... Since those who have internalized oppressive prejudices often engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases, internalized oppression is not only a symptom of an oppressive social climate, but it also represents a mechanism for its continued existence\\". According to University of Massachusetts Amherst doctoral students Valerie Joseph and Tanya O. Williams, \\"Deep racial self-negation[,] ... internalized racial hatred [and] internalized oppression ... stymied [their] growth as people and scholars [and] inhibited [their] ability to be‚Ä¶profound, strong, and beautiful ...\\" Individuals can be made to feel \\"implicated in a project of compliance with the values and goals\\" of the dominant society. Internalized oppression may also occur in disabled individuals, who may distance themselves from others with disabilities to avoid associating themselves with those who may be viewed by society as \\"weak\\" or \\"lazy\\". Nabina Liebow wrote, \\"People of color who internalize stereotypes regarding criminality and moral deviance ... can ... view themselves as outlaws in the moral community\\" and may \\"engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases ... Fulfilling these stereotypes further pushes someone outside the moral fold and intensifies one's damaged moral identity ... [I]nternalizing stereotypes about criminality and moral deviance can led to a pervasive feeling of guilt ... Persistent feelings of guilt can result in mental-health setbacks such as depression\\" and \\"repeated exposure to guilt and similar feelings has been linked with a range of health challenges such as \\"dysfunctional coping, abdominal obesity, and glucose intolerance complicit in the development of Type 2 diabetes\\". ==Manifestations== According to Audre Lorde, manifestations of internalized oppression include voluntary isolation. She describes the relationship between older members of an oppressed group and younger members of the same group as \\"contemptible or suspect or excess.\\" This generation gap leads to \\"historical amnesia\\", with oppressed minorities repeating the learning process and failing to convey knowledge to subsequent generations. Lorde cites oppressed individuals as \\"encouraged to pluck out some one aspect of [one]self and present this as the meaningful whole, eclipsing or denying the other parts of the self\\"; they may hesitate to breach the false stereotypes surrounding them or verbalize resistance to violence. The most common manifestation is self- hatred. Racial manifestations include \\"multifaceted and extreme psychological, social, and economic self-sabotage\\"; a tendency to \\"defer to whites\\", and feelings of being \\"not black enough\\". The self is viewed as a diminished, deviant, criminal and undeserving moral agent. Sandra Bartky identified disturbances in body image, gender expression and power dynamics as manifestations of internalized sexism in women. ==Remedies== According to Audre Lorde, \\"[T]he master's tools will never dismantle the master's house ... My fullest concentration of energy is available to me only when I integrate all the parts of who I am, openly, allowing power from the particular sources of my living to flow back and forth freely through all my different selves, without the restrictions of externally imposed definition\\". \\"To root out internalized patterns of oppression\\" women must \\"recognize differences among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each other's difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles ‚Ä¶to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference ... sharpen[ing] self-definition by exposing the self in work and struggle together with those whom we define as different from ourselves, although sharing similar goals\\". To understand and overcome internalized oppression, Joseph and Williams developed a workshop to \\"introduce and discuss issues of socialization, stereotyping, internalized oppression, and domination.\\" This \\"social justice education model ... encouraged an agent/target model of leadership\\" in which representatives of the oppressor and oppressed classes joined together to guide \\"participants in developing a plan of action to address racism.\\" They recommended that fear \\"left over about discussing race, racism, and internalized racism\\" be set aside to \\"talk forthrightly, honestly, reflectively, and thoughtfully about race\\", and the \\"need to voice ... hurt, the need to surface realities, the need to shine light on a history that was and continues to be ignored\\" is greater than the fear of discussing the issues. The internally oppressed must learn how they have been indoctrinated, to \\"engage in a process of rejecting internalized subordination as an everyday choice\\". ==Related theories== French philosopher Michel Foucault \\"has argued that the rise of parliamentary institutions and of new conceptions of political liberty was accompanied by a darker counter-movement, by the emergence of a new and unprecedented discipline directed against the body. More is required of the body now than mere political allegiance or the approbation of the products of its labor: the new discipline invades the body and seeks to regulate its very forces and operations, the economy and efficiency of its movements ... the production of 'docile bodies' requires that an uninterrupted coercion be directed to the very processes of bodily activity, not just their result; this 'micro-physics of power' fragments and partitions the body's time, its space, and its movements\\". The 18th-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon is a theoretical model of Foucault's ideas. Its constant state of surveillance, imposed by an oppressive external force, serves to induce in the inmate a state of consciousness and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power'; each becomes to himself his own jailer\\". ==See also== *Learned helplessness *Passing (racial identity) ==Notes== Category:Social justice terminology Category:Majority‚Äìminority relations Category:Social privilege ","title":"Internalized oppression"},{"id":"1298957","text":"Boatswain's call A boatswain's call in ceremonial use by a sailor A boatswain's call, pipe or bosun's whistle is a pipe or a non-diaphragm type whistle used on naval ships by a boatswain. It is pronounced, and sometimes spelled, \\"bosun's call\\". The pipe consists of a narrow tube (the gun) which directs air over a metal sphere (the buoy) with a hole in the top. The player opens and closes the hand over the hole to change the pitch. The rest of the pipe consists of a \\"keel\\", a flat piece of metal beneath the gun that holds the call together, and the \\"shackle\\", a keyring that connects a long silver or brass chain that sits around the collar, when in ceremonial uniform. ==History and usage== A boatswain's pipe being held by a sailor. Historically the boatswain's call was used to pass commands to the crew when the voice could not be heard over the sounds of the sea. Because of its high pitch, it could be heard over the activities of the crew and bad weather. It is now used in traditional bugle calls such as Evening Colors/Sunset, and in other ceremonies in most modern navies. It is sometimes accompanied by other auditive features such as ruffles and flourishes, voice commands and announcements, or even a gun salute. It is also the official badge of the Quartermaster, Chief Boatswain's Mate, and Boatswain's Mate and also in the Sea Cadets. ==Honouring== King George VI is piped aboard a Royal Navy battleship in 1942 thumb *Pipe aboard: Flag-rank officers or an important guest is boarding a Navy ship. This is part of a ceremony called \\"manning the side\\" which includes a party of sailors known as \\"side boys\\". It has its origins in the need to hoist visiting senior officers aboard using a bosun's chair when the weather was too rough for the use of ladders. The bosun would use his call to direct the side boys in the hoisting of the chair.Royal W Connell and William P Mack, Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions, Naval Institute Press; 6th edition (August 2004) (pp. 49‚Äì50)) *Funerals: When the body of a person entitled to honours in their lifetime is taken aboard a Navy ship, the same ceremony is observed. ==Commands== A well-used bosun's pipe from World War I (or earlier), owned by a Royal Navy petty officer on board The following are the commands that are passed with the help of a bosun's pipe. *Haul: The most basic of calls. Crews of warships were not allowed to sing work songs or shanties, so the pipe coordinated the sailors. The low note was for the pause and preparatory; the high for pulling on the line. via *The Side or Away Galley: Descends from the tradition of hoisting officers aboard ship in a chair. It is a combination of haul, and then a command to lower. This call remains in use as an honour given to officers when embarking or disembarking. *Away Boats: Used to order a ship's boats to leave the ship's side. *Call the Boatswain's Mates: The boatswain's gang to report. *All Hands on Deck: Crews were split into three (or earlier, two) rotating watches that stood for two to four hours at a time. This call signals the entire crew to assemble on deck. *Word to be Passed: Command for silence, an order to follow. *Pipe Down: Dismissal of all the crew not on watch. *Sweepers. End of the work day. Ostensibly sailors would \\"sweep up\\" prior to departure in preparation for the following day. *Pipe to any meal: Pipe All Hands, followed by long Heave Around (Mess gear), and long Pipe Down. *Still: Used to call the crew to attention. This would be done, for example, when two warships meet, the still being piped as the junior ship salutes the senior ship (the seniority of a warship is the seniority of her captain); a less common alternative to the still being piped is a bugle call. *Carry On: Used after the still, to dismiss the crew back to their duties. *General Call: Piped before an announcement. *Officer of the Day: Call the Officer of the Day to the Gangway. ==References== ==External links== *The Boatswain's Call ‚Äì Photos and Diagrams ReadyAyeReady.com *Bosun's Call MP3s by the US Navy Band *A guide to the Robert S.

Based on a story by Irving Berlin, the film is about a dancer who loves a showgirl who loves a compulsive nightclub-opener who can't stay committed to anything in life for very long. Produced by Sol C. Siegel, Blue Skies was filmed in Technicolor and released by Paramount Pictures. The music, lyrics, and story were written by Irving Berlin, with most of the songs recycled from earlier works. As in Holiday Inn (1942), the film is designed to showcase Berlin's songs. The plot, which is presented in a series of flashbacks with Astaire as narrator, follows a similar formula of Crosby beating Astaire for the affections of a leading lady. Comedy is principally provided by Billy De Wolfe and several musical numbers are performed by Olga San Juan. Joan Caulfield was the prot√©g√© of Mark Sandrich, who directed many of the Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals. Sandrich was originally slated to direct this film, but died of a heart attack during pre-production and Stuart Heisler was drafted in to replace him. Heisler wanted Caulfield replaced, but Crosby‚Äîwho was having an affair with Caulfield‚Äîprotected her. Tap dancer Paul Draper was the initial choice to partner Crosby; however, during the first week of production Draper's speech impediment and his trenchant criticism of Caulfield's dance ability led Crosby to insist on his replacement by Astaire, who, then 47, had already decided that this would be his final film and that he would retire, having spent over 40 years performing before the public. The film was billed as \\"Astaire's last picture\\" and its very strong performance at the box office pleased him greatly, as he had dearly wanted to go out on a high note. The reasons for Astaire's (temporary) retirement remain a source of debate: his own view that he was \\"tired and running out of gas,\\" the sudden collapse in 1945 of the market for Swing music which left many of his colleagues in jazz high and dry, a desire to devote time to establishing a chain of dancing schools, and a dissatisfaction with roles, as in this film, where he was relegated to playing second fiddle to the lead. Ironically, it is for his celebrated solo performance of \\"Puttin' On The Ritz,\\" which featured Astaire leading an entire dance line of Astaires, that this film is most remembered by some today. ==Plot== The story is told in a series of vignettes and musical numbers that serve to show events in flashback. Our narrative link is New York radio star Jed Potter, who once was a renowned Broadway hoofer. The conceit is that he is on the air, telling his life story, which does not yet have an ending. The tale starts just after World War I and centers on two men who became friends in the Army: rising dancer Potter and business-minded Johnny Adams. While hardworking Potter dreams of stardom, the more laid-back and less disciplined Adams has hopes of becoming a successful nightclub owner. In time, dancer Potter falls in love with a band singer, Mary O'Hara. He takes Mary to Adams' nightclub, where she takes a shine to Adams. Potter warns Mary that his old buddy is not the marrying kind, but she marries Adams. The union is not a happy one, despite the birth of a child. Adams' nightclub business is anything but a resounding success, and it turns out Potter was right: Adams is self- centered and unable to commit to his nightclubs, his marriage, or his daughter. The couple divorces, and Mary tries again with Potter. The two even become engaged, but Mary can't go through with the wedding and takes off. A devastated Potter turns to booze and subsequently suffers an accident that puts an end to his dancing career. He winds up behind a radio microphone, sharing his story with his audience, hoping that wherever Mary is, she can hear him. ==Cast== ==Production== Joan Caulfield was pulled out of the film. But Paramount changed their mind and put her back in.Joan Caulfield Keeps Cool: Neither Failure Nor Success Fazes Her Hopper, Hedda. Los Angeles Times (20 Oct 1946: B1. ==Reception== In its initial release period in the US, the movie took in $5.7 million in rental income, making it one of the box office successes of the year. Variety gave a favorable review. \\"'Blue Skies' is another in the show biz cavalcade cycle and it'll spell beaucoup blue skies and black ink for any exhibitor. With Crosby, Astaire and Joan Caulfield on the marquee, a wealth of Irving Berlin songs and lush Technicolor production values, this filmusical can‚Äôt miss for terrific grosses. . .Certainly, for Astaire, it‚Äôs perhaps a new triumph. If he ever seriously thought of retiring, ‚ÄòSkies‚Äô should postpone any such ideas...Crosby is Crosby although a slightly heftier Bing. He's the same troubadour, chirping the ditties as only Crosby does even though his waistline is somewhat more generous than behooves a juve.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times liked it too. \\"So many screen exercises in the music-album line have been so cluttered up with 'biography' that it is a pleasure at last to see one in which a tune-vender‚Äôs life and his music are not mutually and mawkishly abused. Such a one is the Paramount‚Äôs current and cheerfully diverting ‚ÄúBlue Skies,‚Äù which catalogues some songs of Irving Berlin without catalyzing that gentleman's career. And with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby as its bright particular stars, everyone's probity is honored by it‚Äîespecially Mr. Berlin's.\\" ==Soundtrack and dance routines== Crosby applies his famous relaxed crooning style to the many songs he delivers here. In contrast, Astaire, assisted by choreographers Hermes Pan and Dave Robel (for the \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\" routine), delivers a series of dances which explore the theme of confrontation, both with partners and with the audience. As a result, it is one of only a few Astaire films not to feature a romantic-partnered dance. * \\"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\\": Berlin's 1919 song is presented as part of a big Ziegfeld Follies production number, an aesthetic which Astaire parodies in this partnered dance with Caulfield and others. In the first of a series of references to films he made earlier in the 1940s, he reprises a tap sequence performed atop a bar counter in the \\"One for My Baby\\" number from The Sky's the Limit (1943), this time danced down a stairway. * \\"I've Got My Captain Working for Me Now\\": This song, composed in 1919, is performed by Crosby, backed up by Billy De Wolfe. * \\"You'd Be Surprised\\": Another 1919 song, this time performed by Olga San Juan. * \\"All by Myself\\": Crosby performs this 1921 song to Caulfield, who harmonizes with him in the closing phrases. * \\"Serenade to an Old-Fashioned Girl\\": Caulfield sings this number, specially written for the film. * \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\": Although Berlin's 1930 song was originally written for vaudevillian Harry Richman, it has become indelibly associated with Astaire, who also recorded it for Columbia in 1930. In this tap solo with cane, which was widely billed as \\"Astaire's last dance\\", the lyrics are updated,Mueller, p.267: \\"The change may have had to do with changing attitudes towards race and Hollywood's dawning wariness about offending blacks.\\" replacing references to ritzy Harlemites with wealthy whites strutting their stuff up and down Lenox Avenue in Harlem. The routine was produced after the rest of the film had been completed, and according to Astaire, it took \\"five weeks of back-breaking physical work\\" to prepare. It is constructed in three sections, beginning in a dull book-lined office with a tired-looking Astaire showing his years and dressed in a morning suit. Here Astaire delivers the song while executing a gentle tap and cane solo in mock slow-motion, in an amusing parody of his impending retirement. The song finished, he returns to dancing at normal speed and dances around the office while executing an ingenious jumping cane routine, which relied on a concealed floor trigger mechanism. Thus rejuvenated, Astaire sweeps aside a pair of drab curtains to reveal a chorus of nine Fred Astaires ‚Äì achieved by filming two separate versions of Astaire, repeating them four times and interleaving them. The final section of the number is a repeat of the tune with a greatly reduced tempo, which accompanies a complex routine for Astaire and chorus. In \\"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\\" from Top Hat (1935), Astaire pretended to machine-gun his chorus dancers with his cane and loud taps. This time, Astaire joins his chorus in adopting a confrontational, at times almost menacing posture towards his audience.Mueller, p.267 In 1957, on the brink of yet another temporary retirement, Astaire wittily refers back to this routine in the self-parodying \\"The Ritz, Roll And Rock\\" number from Silk Stockings. * \\"(I'll See You In) C-U-B-A\\": A 1920 song performed as a duet by Crosby and San Juan. * \\"A Couple of Song and Dance Men\\": A comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Crosby to a number specially composed for the film. The concept is a reworking of the \\"I'll Capture Your Heart\\" number from Holiday Inn (1942) and the comedy centres on Crosby's legendary reluctance to rehearse. * \\"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song\\": Crosby performs this specially composed number. * \\"Blue Skies\\": Crosby sings this 1926 ballad, the film's title song, to Caulfield. * \\"Nightclub Montage\\": Crosby performs fragments of \\"The Little Things In Life\\" (1930), \\"Not for All the Rice In China\\" (1933) and \\"Russian Lullaby\\" (1927). * \\"Everybody Step\\": Crosby sings this 1921 number, followed by a brief dance for chorus choreographed by Hermes Pan. Crosby directs the chorus in the opening stages, a concept revived and further developed by Pan for the opening number of An Evening with Fred Astaire (1958). * \\"How Deep Is the Ocean?\\": Crosby performs this 1932 song in a musing style, backed by a female quartet. * \\"(Running Around In Circles) Getting Nowhere\\": Crosby sings this specially composed song to his daughter, played by Karolyn Grimes. * \\"Heat Wave\\": The film's major production number features Astaire, Olga San Juan and chorus in a brightly coloured Latin-themed setting. It begins with San Juan's rendition ‚Äì with the lyric \\"making her seat wave\\" toned down to \\"making her feet wave\\" ‚Äì of this 1933 song, while Astaire approaches warily, using dance steps reminiscent of those used in the \\"Dream Ballet\\" number from Yolanda and the Thief (1945), followed by a partnered dance for Astaire and San Juan, and then a tap solo section for Astaire who quotes from the \\"Boogie Barcarolle (Rehearsal Sequence)\\" number from You'll Never Get Rich (1941). This solo section was shot in one take and features music specially composed by Astaire, the only time his music was used in a film. In a counterpoint to the film's opening number, this number ends with him ascending a staircase, only to fall dramatically from a precipice, ending his character's dance career. * \\"Wartime Medley\\": Crosby performs excerpts from \\"Any Bonds Today\\" (1941), \\"This Is The Army, Mr. Jones\\" (1942) and \\"White Christmas\\" (1942) ‚Äì which he had introduced in his previous film with Astaire: Holiday Inn (1942). * \\"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song/Blue Skies (reprise)\\": Performed by Crosby and Caulfield at the film's close. The other Berlin songs which featured only as background music in the film are, in order of use: \\"Tell Me Little Gypsy\\" (1920), \\"Nobody Knows\\" (1920), \\"Mandy\\" (1918), \\"I Wonder\\" (1919), \\"Some Sunny Day\\" (1922), \\"When You Walked Out Someone Else Walked In\\" (1923), \\"Because I Love You\\" (1926), \\"Homesick\\" (1922), \\"How Many Times\\" (1926), \\"The Song Is Ended\\" (1927), \\"Lazy\\" (1924), \\"Always\\" (1925) and \\"I Can't Remember\\" (1933).

It has a population of around 7,600. ==Geography== It borders on the towns of Burglauer, Bad Bocklet, N√ºdlingen, Ma√übach, Gro√übardorf, and Strahlungen. The municipal territory covers an area of 95 km¬≤. The town is located in the southern portion of the Mittelgebirge Rh√∂n. The Lauer river (a tributary of the Franconian Saale) flows directly through the town. ==History== The area around M√ºnnerstadt has been inhabited at least since approximately 2100 BC. Early Celtic settlers farmed in the area of Grosswenkheim, Maria Bildhausen and Althausen (all villages within the municipal boundaries). Around the 1st century AD, Thuringian and soon after, Franconian settlers moved into the area and used the surrounding hills (Michelsberg) and forests for protection in times of danger. By the 5th century AD a village existed in the area where the base of Michelsberg meets the Lauer river. ===Middle Ages=== On 28 December 770, Egi and Sigihilt donated their complete estate including vineyards to the \\"Munirihestat\\" monastery of Fulda. This was the first certified mention of M√ºnnerstadt. Between 770 and 876 there were 18 certificates that proved M√ºnnerstadt was of great importance during the Carolingian period. In 1156 Hermann von Stahleck sponsored the construction of the abbey in Maria Bildhausen. In the 12th century Count Henneberg began to establish his presence in M√ºnnerstadt. Henneberg was also the name of the state of the Holy Roman Empire in which M√ºnnerstadt was located. At this time Henneberg built a small castle on the Lauer river and the inhabitants of the old M√ºnnerstadt left their unprotected dwellings and moved within the shadows of the new castle. Early in the 13th century M√ºnnerstadt began the fortification of the town with the construction of a wall (1251) and four gates around the entire town to protect them from invading forces. With the addition of the Market (1271), the town court, town council (1279) and town seal (1287), M√ºnnerstadt began a period of prosperity. The grain measurement was the standard in 38 towns in Lower Franconia. In 1231 the Teutonic Knights took over the Ministry of M√ºnnerstadt. In 1279 the Augustinian abbey in M√ºnnerstadt was established. As a result of the growth and prosperity brought upon M√ºnnerstadt by Count von Henneberg, Emperor Louis IV gave the community its town rights. M√ºnnerstadt became an important base against the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, but inheritance and financial problems in the mid-14th century led to W√ºrzburg taking over some assets in M√ºnnerstadt. In the late 14th century the town inhabitants rose up to drive out both of the ruling princes but were crushed. In 1385 new laws were established that governed the way of life within the walls of the town. In 1490, the town council sponsored the construction of an altar in the Pfarrkirche (parish church) by noted artist Tilman Riemenschneider. This was his first contract for a large altar. In the early 16th century Martin Luther's predication created an uproar by the farmers and citizens who burned down the abbey of Maria Bildhausen, but the riot was quelled by the hard reprisal by the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. The Augustinian monks had to leave town when the first Protestant priest took over the Ministry of M√ºnnerstadt in 1552. In 1585 Prince-Bischop Julius Echter purchased a large part of the town that was not already owned by the Bishops of W√ºrzburg. As a result, approximately 400 Protestants, mostly craftsmen, left the town. In 1631 the region suffered from the effects of the Thirty Years' war. Swedish invaders took the town. In 1641 a miracle is supposed to have taken place that protected M√ºnnerstadt from more devastation. The Augustinians returned in 1652, rebuilding their abbey and in 1685 they took back control of the Ministry of M√ºnnerstadt. ===Annexation=== During the Napoleonic Wars, Franconia, and with it M√ºnnerstadt, was annexed by Bavaria in 1803. During mediatisation the abbey of Maria Bildhausen was disbanded, the buildings sold or destroyed. In 1804 M√ºnnerstadt became the seat of a federal court. The Teutonic Order was required to leave the town and its possessions were claimed by the town council. The Congress of Vienna later officially awarded Franconia and M√ºnnerstadt to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The town was the local government seat but continued to lose importance. By the early 1900s it was just a locality in the district of Bad Kissingen. ===Modern times=== During World War II, the Marienkapelle, houses and one of the town gates were destroyed by bombing and upon entry of the U.S. forces into the town. With the establishment of East Germany, businesses from Thuringia relocated to M√ºnnerstadt. Some of them have attained international importance. In 1990, traffic on the was rerouted from the town center to the west side of town and the railway to Erfurt was opened after a 50 years' pause. In the winter of 2005 Autobahn 71 was opened for traffic. Its bridge between M√ºnnerstadt and Althausen had a major impact on the local landscape. leftthumb190pxJ√∂rgen gate (J√∂rgentor' ') Church Maria Magdalena M√ºnnerstadt town hall ==Governance== ===Mayor=== Since May 2008 the mayor of M√ºnnerstadt has been 2008 Helmut Blank (CSU).

The 440 was introduced in 1987, whilst the 460 followed in 1989. They were built at the NedCar factory in Born, the Netherlands. The 440 was a five-door front wheel drive hatchback and the 460 a saloon. They shared many components with the already successful Volvo 480, including floorpan, front and rear suspension, engines, transmission and braking systems. ==Design and styling== Facelift Volvo 440 SE The Volvo 440/460 Series models were designed to fit in below Volvo's bigger saloon and estate cars as a replacement to the 340/360 Series, to compete with the likes of the Ford Sierra. Using the basis of design first seen on Volvo's prototype \\"G1\\" and later renamed \\"G12\\" prototype, the five door family car was originally designed as a five-door version only before a sedan/saloon version was designed in Sweden. First generation 400 series cars resemble the bigger 940, whilst the facelifted example bore a resemblance to the Volvo 850 to increase sales. The interiors of the 400 series variants were designed by famed Volvo designer, Peter Horbury. == Safety == Safety has always been an issue of primary importance to Volvo, who have developed many features since adopted widely throughout the car industry. Crumple zones were carried on from the previous 300 series into the design of 400 series cars, aided by additional airbags both for passenger and front driver. Other safety items included a high level brake light; a 'bulb blown' warning system; 'door open' warning light; adjustable seat belts with pretensioners and a seatbelt reminder/warning light: all of which all came as standard on all models throughout the range. Safety was further improved on models from 1993 onward with the introduction of Side Impact Protection System (or SIPS). This was virtually unheard of at the time, and was provided (again as standard) by the forerunner of the SIPS system used on all modern Volvo cars. United Kingdom models also included daytime running lights as standard, although these could be disabled by the dealer at the owner's request. The original advertising campaign for the 400 range centred on occupant safety. A family of crash test dummies appeared to 'survive' intact after driving the car through a plate glass office window some storeys up. Various other scenarios simulating crashes were employed in addition, all of which ended with the family walking away relatively unharmed ‚Äî only to be used again in further crash tests. == Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) option == At launch, Volvo decided to offer a four speed ZF conventional style automatic transmission, even if it took Volvo a few more years to redesign the DAF derived CVT transmission with engines over 1700cc. Not all 440s or 460s fitted with automatic transmission had the CVT (constantly variable transmission) version, the majority having a conventional four speed automatic. The CVT transmission, as fitted to the last generation 440/460 Series, used steel belts (as opposed to rubber belts used in the 300 Series) and was known as Transmatic, although cars equipped with this auto box were renamed HTA (short for High Tech Auto). The Transmatic differs greatly in its construction, and apart from the basic CVT principle of belts running in expanding pulleys, it has nothing in common with the Variomatic CVT used in the earlier 300 Series. Whilst the Variomatic system was completely exposed to the elements at the rear of the car and used dry rubber belts, Transmatic was mounted transversely in the front of the car, and featured steel belts running in oil within a sealed gearbox casing. Subsequent CVT transmissions (such as Audi's multitronic), have continued to use this configuration. The HTA gearbox was subsequently used in Rover's Metro redesigned model (last generation) and carries the VT-1 model component number. == Standard specifications == The specifications of most models of 440 and 460 were relatively high when compared with similarly priced alternatives. The list of options included as 'standard' grew and changed regularly throughout the lifespan of the car, varying from country to country and later also differing according to trim level. Furthermore, various 'special editions' were also introduced with equipment differing from that found as standard on all other models; making any more general comparison difficult. Heated front seats were found across the entire range, as was a five speed gearbox; adjustable seatbelt with pre tensioners; folding two thirds split rear seats; lockable glovebox with light; and boot and ashtray lights. Options listed as standard on later models include anti-lock brakes (ABS); traction control; front fog lights; separate reading lights for passengers in the back (located in the rear grab handles and cleverly shielded from the driver's view); Radio/cassette player with six high fidelity Blaupunkt stereo speakers; tinted UV blocking windows; Map reading lights; Graduated sun visor; Self- supporting (propless) bonnet; rear window wash/wipe; lumbar support; electric windows/mirrors; heated wing mirrors; central locking; tachometer. The driver's console on all models housed an array of warning lights, a rheostat and a lambda sensor monitor. There were two generations of 440/460: the 'Mark 2' replacing the original model from 1994. Changes included a new bonnet and nose, new rear light clusters, body coloured bumpers, a different grille and numerous new options of engine, spec. level and equipment. The changes made the cars resemble the very successful Volvo 850 model more closely. == Engines == Both 440 and 460 had a 1.7 litre Renault engine at launch, carried over from the Volvo 300 Series; this was available between 1988 and 1992 in two different versions with a carburettor (with and or and 130 Nm), multipoint fuel injection in two different versions (with and or and ) in the early GLT models and with multipoint fuel injection and a turbocharger with intercooler. The standard 1,721 cc powerplant produced and a claimed top speed of , which was marginally superior to some of its contemporary counterparts, such as the Volkswagen Passat and the Opel Vectra, as their 1.8 litre engines only had 90 bhp. The turbocharged version offered , and a claimed top speed of . This kind of performance put it on par with higher end 1.8 litre engines, such as the BMW 318 or 518 of the time, and equalled the performance of a host of other contemporary 2.0 litre engines. From 1992, the engines offered were substantially different, with the range now including 1.6i (), 1.8i (), and 2.0i () naturally aspirated petrol engines in addition to the 1.7 litre turbo option found in the mark 1 range. The 1.6 was equipped with multi point fuel injection; the 1.8 engine had single point injection, and the 2.0 came with a choice of single point and multi point injection units, the older 1.7 turbocharged version however had more power. From 1994, the engines became slightly more powerful. Diesel versions also became available: a 1.9 litre Renault turbodiesel option (89 bhp) was offered, badged as either TD or Turbo Diesel, depending on which European market the car was sold in. Volvo also released a limited market 1.8 HTA, the \\"High Tech Auto\\", using a much improved electric belt assisted CVT auto transmission but it was short lived and not many models survive. == Trim levels == Pre facelift Volvo 440 GL (the Netherlands) Facelift Volvo 440 SE (Australia) Early cars were available in L, GL, GLE, GLEi, GLT and Turbo trims. The L and GL trim level was basic; GLE was plush and along with the GL model offered additional split seats compared to the fixed one piece rear bench on the L model; and GLT was the 'luxury' trim level. GLT and Turbo were externally similar, both featuring lowered sports suspension and a large rear spoiler. Other trim levels were gradually phased in, such as limited edition Si and Xi, and Turbo later became simply an engine variant, rather than a full trim variant. From 1992, the range was the same for a year and a half. As a result of the facelift of 1994, the range altered drastically. Trim levels were now: base, S (which was intended as a \\"family\\" variant), Si (intended as a \\"sports\\" variant), SE (\\"business\\" variant), GLT (\\"performance\\" variant) and CD (\\"luxury\\" variant) trims. An Li model also appeared in 1994, offering base spec with the addition of power steering (and, on later models, a sunroof). From at least 1995 onwards, all engine choices were available with all trim levels. The later Si models and all GLT models were easily distinguishable from the rest of the range, due to the additions of sports suspension (making the car ride visibly lower) and a large rear spoiler. The GLT's specification was, however, significantly higher in featuring part leather upholstery, alloy wheels, ABS, traction control and an uprated stereo system as standard equipment. The SE was also slightly more distinguishable, having a small rear spoiler which it shared only with the limited edition ES pack model. The ES pack could be added to cars of any engine variant from late 1995. It featured sports suspension, 15\\" alloy wheels, metallic paint, door sill decals, electric front windows, electric heated mirrors, front and rear armrests, ABS and immobiliser in addition to the small spoiler and an uprated stereo unit. The S model was also notable, having two foldout child booster seats integrated into the car's rear seat, a dustbin incorporated in the dashboard and rear headrests. However unlike all the 300 Series, the 440 had, at last split rear seats fitted, though only the basic models lacked a split. Specification of all later cars was high, with many featuring air conditioning (particularly as a result of a special offer operated by Volvo in the United Kingdom in 1995, where ¬£100 deleted the standard electric glass sunroof from the car's specification in favour of air conditioning and 15\\" alloy wheels, identical to those fitted to Volvo 850 CD models, albeit with lower-profile tyres), remote central locking, electric aerial, electric windows, electric door mirrors and heated front seats. The line up was reduced (for example, the Si and GLT models were replaced by the GS, which had all of the Si's equipment and some of the GLT's, such as ABS) prior to production ceasing in 1996, when the Volvo S40/V40, which shared its platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma, replaced the 440/460 Series. == References == 440 Category:Cars of the Netherlands Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1987 Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission Category:VDL Nedcar vehicles ","title":"Volvo 440/460"},{"id":"1299040","text":"John Houstoun (; August 31, 1744 ‚Äì July 20, 1796) was an American lawyer and statesman from Savannah, Georgia. He was one of the original Sons of Liberty and also a delegate for Georgia in the Second Continental Congress in 1775. He was the Governor of Georgia, in 1778, and again in 1784‚Äì1785. ==Personal life== John was born to aristocratic Scots immigrants in St. George's Parish, near modern Waynesboro and the eastern border of Georgia. His parents were Sir Patrick (Baronet) and Priscilla (Dunbar) Houstoun. His father served as the registrar of land grants for the Georgia Colony and the collector of quit- rents (a permanent annual tax on each grant). John was educated in Savannah and read law there. He was admitted to the bar and started a law practice in Savannah. Houstoun married Hannah Bryan, whose father Jonathan was a wealthy Savannah merchant. They built their home, White Bluff, about nine miles (14 km) northwest of Savannah. The couple had no children. ==Revolutionary years== Houstoun was a successful lawyer, and was appointed to the Governor's Council by James Wright. But in 1774, Houstoun was one of the founders of the nascent revolutionary government in Georgia. He joined with Archibald Bulloch and others to form a Committee of Correspondence in support of the residents of Boston suffering the effects of the Boston Port Act. The committee went on to create formal protests against other measures brought about by the Intolerable Acts. That same year, John was a representative in the rebel Provincial Congress of Georgia, and they named him as a delegate to the First Continental Congress. He declined, since fewer than half the counties were represented in the Provincial Congress. By 1775 this defect was remedied and he accepted that appointment. In Congress, he was a strong supporter of the movement toward independence, but resisted the non-importation agreements because of their negative effects on the southern colonies. He was reappointed to the national congress in 1776, but did not attend. He stayed at home to work with the Committee of Safety to thwart the loyalist efforts of the popular preacher and loyalist, John Zubly. Early in 1778, he was elected as the second revolutionary Governor of Georgia also being the first governor of Georgia to be born in Georgia. That same year, he took charge of the Georgia militia in an abortive attempt to seize the British post of St. Augustine, Florida. His disagreements with the Continental Army commander, Robert Howe, contributed greatly to the failure of the expedition. When the British, in response, captured Savannah on December 29, Houstoun was forced into hiding. Creek Indians raided plantations and carried slaves off from within a few miles of Savannah. The \\"daily depredations\\" of these raiding groups, Governor Houstoun wrote, \\"almost at our very Town-Gates, threaten us with certain ruin unless some remedy is applied.\\" ==Later career== After the surrender at Yorktown, the British abandoned Savannah in 1782. Houstoun returned home, taking a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives, where he briefly served as Speaker in 1783. He then was elected to another one-year term as governor in 1784. Houstoun pushed for more access to the Indian Country. \\"Formerly when the people of Pensacola and Mobile were one and the same with Us, we did not carry on trade with you from this Country, and then there was no Occasion to ask a Path thro‚Äô the Creek Nation.\\" Since the Spanish controlled Florida, he wanted more east-west trade routes. The Creeks declined to grant the Choctaws access to the Georgia traders. On September 28, 1784 Governor John Houstoun granted four 5000 acre tracts of vacant land in Franklin county, Georgia to French Vice Admiral d'Estaing and his heirs. The four bountyland grants totaling 20,000 acres were subsequently registered on June 13, 1785. In 1790 he became the first elected Mayor of Savannah, and in 1791 was appointed a justice of the Superior Court of Georgia. After 1792 he served as president of the Chatham Academy. ==Legacy== Houstoun died at his home, White Bluff, just outside Savannah on July 20, 1796. Houston County in central Georgia was named for him. The variation in spelling is typical of early nineteenth century orthography. John Houstoun pronounced his name \\"HOUSE-ton\\" and that pronunciation has been adopted in the locales named in his honor. ==References== ==See also== *List of Speakers of the Georgia House of Representatives ==Further reading== * Edith Duncan Johnston; \\" _The Houstouns of Georgia_ \\"; 1950, University of Georgia Press ==External links== * * Timeline of John Houstoun's life * \\"To Benjamin Franklin from John Houstoun, 17 March 1778,\\" Founders Online, National Archives. * Governor John Houston historical marker Category:1744 births Category:1796 deaths Category:Continental Congressmen from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:18th- century American politicians Category:Governors of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Mayors of Savannah, Georgia Category:People from Burke County, Georgia Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:Independent state governors of the United States Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Independents Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law ","title":"John Houstoun"},{"id":"1299041","text":"==Events== ===January events=== * January - The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway's mainline (485 miles of track) is now completely under CTC. * January - Louisville and Nashville Railroad begins the merger process with the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. * January 21 - The Milwaukee Road discontinues the western segment of the Columbian, a Chicago - Tacoma, Washington passenger train. * January 21 - O.

Haren played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Washington Nationals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami Marlins, and Chicago Cubs. He now serves as an executive with the Diamondbacks. Haren starred for the baseball teams at Bishop Amat High School and Pepperdine University before the Cardinals selected him in the second round of the 2001 MLB draft. After he made his MLB debut in 2003, the Cardinals traded him to the Athletics to get Mark Mulder. After his first All-Star season in 2007, the Athletics traded him to the Diamondbacks for prospects. After appearing in two more All-Star Games in 2008 and 2009, the Diamondbacks traded him to the Angels during the 2010 season for Joe Saunders and pitching prospects. A free agent after the 2012 season, he pitched for the Nationals in 2013, and then signed with the Dodgers for the 2014 season. The Dodgers traded Haren to Miami after the 2014 season. On July 31, 2015, Haren was traded to the Chicago Cubs for two minor league prospects. Haren is one of a small number of MLB pitchers to have beaten all 30 major-league teams. Although he was never a particularly well-known player, Haren finished his career with three All Star game appearances and the seventh best strikeout-to-walk ratio in major league history. == Amateur career == Haren attended Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, California, where he played for the school's baseball team as a first baseman. He was named All-San Gabriel Valley. After he graduated from Bishop Amat, Haren enrolled at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, on a college baseball scholarship. Playing for the Pepperdine Waves baseball team, he was selected as West Coast Conference (WCC) Freshman of the Year in 1999. As a sophomore in 2000, Haren had an 8-5 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.08 earned run average (ERA). In the 2001 season, his junior year, Haren posted a 2.22 ERA in 17 starts, while teammate Noah Lowry posted a 1.71 ERA in 18 starts. Haren was named WCC Player of the Year and Lowry was Pitcher of the Year. Haren also was a Second team College All-America. The teammates skipped their senior seasons, and Lowry was taken in the first round (30th overall) by the San Francisco Giants and Haren was taken in the second round (72nd overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. ==Professional career== ===St. Louis Cardinals=== Haren made his professional debut with the New Jersey Cardinals in 2001 and was 3-3 with a 3.10 ERA in 12 appearances, with 8 starts. He also struck out 57 while only walking 8. He then made 28 starts in A-ball in 2002 for the Peoria Chiefs and Potomac Cannons, finishing with a combined ERA of 2.74. He started 2003 in Double-A with the Tennessee Smokies, but was promoted after eight starts to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was a combined 8-1 with a 2.68 ERA in 16 starts in 2003, with 84 strikeouts and was selected as the Cardinals minor league pitcher of the year. Haren made his major league debut at the age of 22, on June 30, 2003. He was the starting pitcher against the San Francisco Giants and allowed four runs (two earned) in six innings to pick up the loss. He recorded his first Major League win with a six-inning start where he allowed only one run against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 19. After finishing 2003 with a 5.08 ERA for the Cardinals in 14 starts, he was sent back down to AAA Memphis for the 2004 season. He received a late-season call-up, and made five appearances in the postseason for the Cardinals, including two in the World Series. The Cardinals were swept by the Boston Red Sox, but Haren pitched well, tossing 4 scoreless innings. Pitching in a game against the Seattle Mariners ===Oakland Athletics=== After the 2004 season, the Cardinals traded Haren in a package that included right-handed reliever Kiko Calero and top hitting prospect Daric Barton to the Oakland Athletics for Mark Mulder. Haren went 14‚Äì12 with a 3.73 ERA in his first full season as a major leaguer. In 2005, Haren finished in the top 10 in the American League in the following categories: innings pitched (217, ninth place), strikeouts (163, 6th place), and complete games (3, fourth place). Furthermore, in 2007, Haren had one of the best seasons among any pitcher in the majors. Haren finished in the top ten in the American League in wins, with 15, strikeouts, with 192, innings pitched, with 222‚Öî, strikeout to walk ratio, with 3.49, and finished in the top three in the AL in ERA with 3.07. In 2007, he was also selected to start the MLB All Star Game. ===Arizona Diamondbacks=== 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis On December 14, 2007, Haren was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, along with Connor Robertson, for prospects including Carlos Gonz√°lez, Brett Anderson, Aaron Cunningham, Greg Smith, Dana Eveland, and Chris Carter. In his first season with the Diamondbacks he was selected to the 2008 All-Star game at Yankee Stadium along with his teammate, Brandon Webb. He finished 2008 with a 3.33 ERA to go along with a 16‚Äì8 win‚Äìloss record, and a career-high 206 strikeouts in 216 innings. His strikeout to walk ratio of 5.15 was the best in the National League, trailing only Roy Halladay On August 6, 2008, Haren agreed to a four-year, $44.75 million contract with a team option for the 2013 season. Haren was also selected as a 2009 NL All-Star, representing the Diamondbacks along with Justin Upton. Haren finished the year with a record of 14‚Äì10, 3.14 ERA, and 223 strikeouts in 229‚Öì innings, throwing three complete games in 33 starts. He once again led the National League with a strikeout to walk ratio of 5.87, and ranked third in total number of strikeouts and ninth in strikeouts per nine innings (8.75 K/9). His 1.003 WHIP was the best mark in the big leagues. In 2009, he was named #33 on the Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list. He began the 2010 season with a 7-8 record and a 4.60 ERA through July 25. ===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim=== On July 25, 2010, the Diamondbacks traded Haren to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for starting pitcher Joe Saunders, and minor league pitchers Rafael Rodr√≠guez, Patrick Corbin, and Tyler Skaggs. In 13 games with the Angels to close out the 2010 season, Haren went 5‚Äì4 with 75 strikeouts and a 2.87 ERA. His final numbers for the entire season were a 12-12 record, 3.91 ERA, 216 strikeouts and 235 innings in 35 starts. 2011 saw a rebound from Haren, as he pitched to a 16-11 record with a 3.17 ERA in 35 games (34 starts). He struck out 192 in 238‚Öì innings and led the American League with a 5.82 strikeout to walk ratio, while throwing a career high four complete games (three shutouts). On May 24, 2012, Haren recorded a career-high 14 strikeouts in a complete-game shutout against the Seattle Mariners in Seattle, allowing four hits in a 3‚Äì0 victory. On November 2, 2012, after an attempt to trade him to the Chicago Cubs for Carlos M√°rmol fell through, the Angels declined Haren's $15.5 million option, instead buying it out for $3.5 million, and he became a free agent. ===Washington Nationals=== Haren signed a one-year, $13 million contract with the Washington Nationals on December 7, 2012. After his June 22, 2013, start against the Colorado Rockies, Haren owned a major league-worst 6.15 ERA amongst qualified starters. He had also given up a league-leading number of home runs with 19 home runs surrendered through 15 starts. Haren was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 25 with right shoulder inflammation. He later explained that the disabled list stint was more for \\"mental reasons than physical reasons,\\" as he was lonely with his family remaining in California. Haren finished the 2013 season 10-14 with a 4.67 ERA. After starting the season with a 4-11 record and a 5.79 ERA in his first 18 games, he finished the season with a 6-3 record and a 3.14 ERA in his final 13 games. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== Haren pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers On November 25, 2013, Haren signed to a one-year, $10 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The deal included a vesting option for 2015, which became a player option when he pitched 180 innings in 2014. Haren started the season strong, winning five of his first six decisions. However, around the all-star break he had a brief stretch where he pitched poorly, losing five straight starts from July 5 to August 1. He turned it around again and pitched well down the stretch. He finished with a record of 13‚Äì11 and an ERA of 4.02 in 32 starts for the Dodgers in 2014. For the year, he finished second in the league in home runs allowed with 27. After the season, Haren exercised his player option for the 2015 season. Regarding rumors that the Dodgers might trade him, Haren said he only wanted to pitch in Los Angeles, either for the Dodgers or the Angels, and that he had \\"no interest\\" in playing for anyone else. ===Miami Marlins=== On December 10, 2014, the Dodgers traded Haren, Dee Gordon, and Miguel Rojas, to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Andrew Heaney, Chris Hatcher, Austin Barnes, and Enrique Hern√°ndez. He voiced his preference to pitch for a team on the West Coast. Although it was reported that Haren had requested a trade, he reported to spring training with the Marlins and denied having requested a trade.  On July 31, 2015, the Marlins traded Haren to the Chicago Cubs for minor leaguers Elliot Soto and Ivan Pineyro. Haren announced he would retire after the 2015 season. Haren stated, \\"If I don't pitch in the postseason, that's it. It's been fun. Hopefully there's a lot more games to go. If my name is called, I'll be ready.\\" ===Executive career=== In December 2016, the Diamondbacks hired Haren as a special pitching assistant, applying sabermetrics and other baseball analytics. ==Pitching style== Haren threw an four-seam fastball, an two-seam fastball, a sharp split-finger fastball, and a spike curve. Haren had also added and relied heavily upon an cut fastball, which he added in 2008 and had credited with rejuvenating his career. The cut fastball made up more than half of his pitch selection to right-handed hitters, with his fastballs and occasional split-finger fastball filling up most of the rest. Against lefties, Haren mixed all of his pitches but used his two-seam fastball the most. His curveball was a change-of-pace pitch, and not a main weapon; he didn't throw it much to right-handers or in two-strike counts. By contrast, he threw about half of his splitters with two strikes. Haren was also known for exceptional control. His strikeout-to-walk ratio was above four for his career. , he was the active leader in that category. Haren usually had a slow pitching delivery, highlighted by a slight pause in the middle of his windup, that he sped up with runners on base. His pitching style was often dubbed a \\"chess match\\" by reporters and announcers (particularly Daron Sutton and Mark Grace of the Diamondbacks announce team) due to his ability to change speeds and throw almost any pitch in any count (and often throws pitches in succession, i.e., four straight breaking balls), often going against scouting reports, making it particularly hard to hit him. ==Personal life== Haren grew up in West Covina, California. He is of Irish and Mexican descent. He and his wife have two children, and live in Orange County, California. ==See also== *List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders ==References== ==External links== *Stats and Pitch Arsenal at SportsMogul.com Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim players Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Miami Marlins players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:New Jersey Cardinals players Category:Peoria Chiefs players Category:Potomac Cannons players Category:Tennessee Smokies players Category:Memphis Redbirds players Category:Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:National League All-Stars Category:People from Monterey Park, California Category:People from Greater Los Angeles Category:Pepperdine Waves baseball players ","title":"Dan Haren"},{"id":"1299045","text":"Banana boat may refer to: ==Transport== ===Aircraft=== * \\"Banana Boat\\", nickname for Consolidated B-24 Liberator, an American World War II bomber ===Vessels=== * Banana boat (boat), an unpowered recreational boat * Banana boat (ship), a ship whose primary role is the transportation of bananas as cargo ==Art, entertainment, and media== * Banana Boat, a Polish a cappella group created in 1994 * \\"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\\", a 1956 traditional Jamaican folk song * Banana Boat, an alternate slang term related to the phrase Fresh off the boat for newly arrived immigrants * Banana boat, the nickname for the group of NBA players Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade ==Brands and enterprises== * Banana Boat, a brand of sunscreen manufactured by Sun Pharmaceuticals Corp, a subsidiary of Edgewell Personal Care ==Food, drink, and related items== * Banana boat (food), a campfire dish consisting of a banana stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate *Banana boat, a liqueur-based cocktail *Banana boat, a dish used to serve the banana split dessert ","title":"Banana boat"},{"id":"1299062","text":"This is a timeline of major events in the Muslim world from 500 AD to 600 AD (13 BH ‚Äì 23 BH). ==Sixth century (500‚Äì600)== This century corresponds to approximately 126 - 23 BH. * 570: Birth of Muhammad * 570: Death of Abdullah, Muhammad's father * 573: Birth of Abu Bakr.

The type species is Ada aurantiaca. These are epiphytic or lithophytic orchids. They are native to Nicaragua down to northern South America, down the Andes to Bolivia. They are warm to cool- growing plants to be found in wet, montane forests at higher elevations, between 650 and 2700 m, but most between 1800 and 2200 m. The lanceolate leaves are distichous (growing in two ranks) with a length of 20 cm, growing on pseudobulbs with a maximum length of 10 cm. The foliaceous leaf sheaths are well-developed. The pendent and spectacularly colorful inflorescences do not grow above the leaves. They can produce up to 15 fragrant flowers, blooming from January till April. The color can vary from white to greenish and orange. The perianth is narrow and pointed, with almost similar sepals and petals.. The floral bracts are large and inflated. The lip is reflexed. It bears a basal callus made up of two plates. It often ends in two tooth-like mounds. Ada uses a \\"pseudoparasitism\\" method of attracting parasite pollinators, by mimicking their host. They are not easy to cultivate, because of their high demands. == References == * Williams, N. H. 1972. A reconsideration of Ada and the glumaceous brassias.

Two-handed alphabets are less widespread than one-handed manual alphabets. They may be used to represent the Latin alphabet (for example in the manual alphabet used in Turkish Sign Language) or the Cyrillic alphabet (as is sometimes used in Yugoslav Sign Language). == BANZSL alphabet == This alphabet is used in the BANZSL group of sign languages. It has been used in British Sign Language and Auslan since at least the 19th century, and in New Zealand Sign Language since the 1970s. Variations of this alphabet are also used in dialects of Indo-Pakistani Sign Language. This chart shows the BANZSL alphabet. === Notes === * Signs may be made with the left or right hand as the dominant hand, but the roles do not usually switch when fingerspelling. The dominant hand generally acts as a pointer (or \\"pen\\") while the secondary hand acts as \\"paper\\". * The vowels A, E, I, O and U are formed by touching each digit respectively, starting with the thumb. * The letters C, D, J, K, P, Q, T, V, X, and Y make the shape of the letter itself. * The letters B, F, G, L, M, N, R, S, and W suggest the shape of the letter. * The letters G, L and R suggest only the lowercase form of the letter. * Only the letters H and Z do not have a strong relation to their shape or position in the alphabet. * Many letters appear backwards (for example, in right-handed fingerspelling, R and D often appears backwards to the viewer). This is not a mistake or a problem, and your signing does not need to be adjusted to compensate. == BANZSL deafblind alphabet== This is a variation on the above alphabet, modified for tactile use by those communicating with people who are deafblind. The sender holds the wrist of the receiver. The receiver's hand is relaxed, with the palm open and fingers slightly apart. The signer uses their dominant hand like a pen to sign on the non-dominant hand of the receiver. As a beginner, you may squeeze the wrist of the receiver between words since you will spell haltingly. Once you can spell fluently, simply put a short pause between words. AEIOU are the pads of each finger, beginning with the thumb. right ;A: BANZSL \\"A\\" is signed on the tip of the thumb ;B: The fingers and thumb are held together to form half of the BANZSL \\"B\\" and placed on the palm ;C: Draw your finger along the edge of the thumb and up the index finger, alternatively the direction of the sweep can be reversed ;D: The signer forms half of the BANZSL \\"D\\" with their dominant hand and places it against the recessive hand of the receiver; an alternative is to use the index and middle finger placed against the recessive hand ;E: BANZSL \\"E\\" is signed on the tip of the index finger ;F: Half of the BANZSL \\"F\\" is signed either on the palm or on the top of the receiver's index finger ;G: Half of the BANZSL \\"G\\" is signed on the palm ;H: BANZSL \\"H\\" is signed across the palm ;I: BANZSL \\"I\\" is signed on the tip of the middle finger ;J: BANZSL \\"J\\" is signed on the hand of the receiver ;K: Half of the BANZSL \\"K\\" is signed on the first knuckle of the index finger ;L: BANZSL \\"L\\" is signed on the palm ;M: BANZSL \\"M\\" is signed on the palm ;N: BANZSL \\"N\\" is signed on the palm ;O: BANZSL \\"O\\" is signed on the tip of the ring finger ;P: Pinch the pad and nail of the index finger (P for pinch) ;Q: Hook your curled index finger around the thumb ;R: BANZSL \\"R\\" is signed on the palm ;S: Hook your curled index finger around the little finger ;T: BANZSL \\"T\\" is signed on the receiver's hand ;U: BANZSL \\"U\\" is signed on the tip of the little finger ;V: BANZSL \\"V\\" is signed on the palm ;W: There are three ways to do this; all are acceptable, but your receiver might not know them all: * Interlace your fingers with theirs * Grab all their fingers from the side (if your hand is folded over, their index finger lies across the first knuckles of your hand) * Grab their fingers from the top (if your hand is folded over, their fingertips lie across the first knuckles of your hand) ;X: Half of the BANZSL \\"X\\" is signed on the index finger ;Y: The index finger is used to sign a BANZSL \\"Y\\" on the hand of the receiver ;Z: The side of the palm is placed on the palm of the receiver == Other deafblind alphabets == From \\"Deafblind Manual Alphabet\\", on Deafblind Information, Senses Australia (links added): :\\"Variations of this alphabet used in some dialects of Indo- Pakistani Sign Language. : :\\"Other forms of manual deafblind alphabet are used around the world - eg.

The lyrics tell the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present he is turned into steel by a magnetic field, and his attempts to warn the public are ignored and mocked. Feeling shunned and alone, Iron Man plans his revenge on mankind, causing the apocalypse seen in his vision. Upon hearing the main guitar riff for the first time, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne remarked that it sounded \\"like a big iron bloke walking about\\".Classic Albums ‚Äì Paranoid, by Isis Productions/Eagle Rock Entertainment The title became \\"Iron Man\\", with Geezer Butler writing the lyrics around the title. Osbourne sang behind a metal fan to get the sound effect in its first line, 'I am Iron Man!'.

It has thin, wrinkled brownish or gray colored skin, with fine hairs scattered over its body and a white chest patch.Trichechus inunguis. Sandra L. Husar. Mammalian Species, No. 72, Trichechus inunguis (Jun. 15, 1977), pp. 1-4. Published by: American Society of Mammalogists Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3503928 It is the smallest of the three extant species of manatee.Trials of a Primatologist. - smithsonianmag.com. Accessed March 16, 2008. ==Taxonomy== The specific name, inunguis is Latin for \\"nailless.\\" The genus name Trichechus, comes from Latin meaning \\"hair\\", referencing the whiskers around the manatee's mouth. ==Physical characteristics== Ranges of body weight and size observed are 7.5‚Äì346.5 kg and 76.0 ‚Äì255.5 cm for captive males, 8.1‚Äì379.5 kg and 71.0‚Äì266.5 cm for captive females, and 120.0‚Äì270.0 kg and 162.0 ‚Äì230.0 cm for free-ranging manatees, respectively. The maximum actual Amazonian manatee weight reported is 379.5 kg. Calves of the species are born weighing 10‚Äì15 kg and 85 ‚Äì105 cm long. The Amazonian Manatees increase in length approximately 1.6-2.0 mm per day. This length is measured along the curvature of the body so absolute length can differ between individuals. As calves, they gain an average of 1 kilogram per week. Amazonian manatees are large, cylindrically shaped mammals, with forelimbs modified into flippers, no free hind-limbs, and the rear of the body in the form of a flat, rounded, horizontal paddle. The flexible flippers are used for aiding motion over the bottom, scratching, touching and even embracing other manatees, and moving food into and cleaning the mouth. The manatee's upper lip is modified into a large bristly surface, which is deeply divided. It can move each side of the lips independently while feeding. The general coloration is grey, and most Amazonian manatees have a distinct white or bright pink patch on the breast. Amazonian manatees, similar to all living manatee species in the family Trichechidae, have polyphyodont teeth. Their teeth are continuously replaced horizontally from the caudal portion of the jaw to the rostral portion throughout the manatee's life, a unique trait among mammals. Only the closest living relative of order Sirenia, elephants, show a similar characteristic of teeth replacement, but elephants have a limited set of these replacement teeth. As the teeth migrate rostrally in the manatee, the roots will be resorbed and the thin enamel will wear down until the tooth is eventually shed. Referred to as cheek teeth, differentiation of manatee teeth into molars and premolars has not occurred, and manatees additionally do not have incisors or canine teeth. These teeth migrate at a rate of about 1-2 mm/month, based on wear and chewing rates. The Amazonian manatee lacks nails on its flippers, setting it apart from other manatees. Additionally, Amazonian manatees have a very small degree of rostral deflection (30.4¬∞), which can be used as an indication of where in the water column the animal feeds. A small degree of deflection means that the end of the snout is straighter with regards to the caudal portion of the jaw. Animals with a greater degree of deflection, such as D. dugong at about 70¬∞ of deflection, are more of a benthic species, feed on the seafloor, and have snouts that point almost completely ventrally. Only T. senegalensis has a smaller rostral deflection of about 25.8¬∞. This is believed to maximize the efficiency of feeding. A small degree of rostral deflection allows Amazonian manatees to feed more effectively at the surface of the water, where much of their food is found. ==Behavior and biology== The Amazonian manatee is the only sirenian that lives exclusively in freshwater habitat.Amaral R.S., V.M.F da Silvia, and F.C.W Rosas. (2010). Body weight/length relationship and mass estimation using morphometric measurements in Amazonian manatees Trichechus inunguis Mammalia: Sirenia. Marine Biodiversity Records. 3:e105-e109. The species relies on changes in the peripheral circulation for its primary mechanism for thermoregulation by using sphincters to deflect blood flow from areas of the body in close contact with water. They also rely on subcutaneous fat to reduce heat loss.Gallican G.J., R.C. Best, and J.W. Kanwisher. (1982). Temperature regulation in the Amazonian manatee Trichechus inunguis. Physiological zoology. The University of Chicago Press 255-262. Manatees have nostrils, not blowholes like other aquatic mammals, which close when under water to keep water out and open when above water to breathe. Although manatees can remain under water for extended periods, surfacing for air about every five minutes is common.Metabolism and Respiration of the Amazonian Manatee (Trichechus inunguis). G.J. Gallivan and R.C. Best. Physiological Zoology, Vol. 53, No. 3 (Jul., 1980), pp. 245-253. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/30155787 The longest documented submergence of an Amazonian manatee in captivity is 14 minutes. Manatees make seasonal movements synchronized with the flood regime of the Amazon Basin. They are found in flooded forests and meadows during the flood season, when food is abundant. The Amazonian manatee has the smallest degree of rostral deflection (25¬∞ to 41¬∞) among sirenians, an adaptation to feed closer to the water surface. It is both nocturnal and diurnal and lives its life almost entirely underwater. Only its nostrils protrude from the surface of the water while it searches river and lake bottoms for vegetation. The Amazonian and Florida manatees are the only manatees known to vocalize. They have been observed vocalizing alone and with others, particularly between cows and their calves.Bullock, Theodore H. ; Daryl P. Domning; and Robin C. Best (1980). \\"Evoked Brain Potentials Demonstrate Hearing in a Manatee (Trichechus inunguis). Journal of Mammalogy. 61(1): 130-133. Published by: American Society of Mammalogists Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1379969 ===Diet=== The manatees themselves feed on a variety of aquatic macrophytes, including aroids (especially Pistia, aka \\"water lettuce\\"), grasses, bladderworts, hornworts, water lilies, and particularly, water hyacinths.Ecology, Distribution, Harvest, and Conservation of the Amazonian Manatee Trichechus inunguis in Ecuador Robert M.

Maintaining a herbivorous diet, the manatee has a similar post-gastric digestive process to that of the horse. The manatee consumes approximately 8% of its body weight in food per day. During the July‚ÄìAugust dry season when water levels begin to fall, some populations become restricted to the deep parts of large lakes, where they often remain until the end of the dry season in March. They are thought to fast during this period, their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates ‚Äì only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate ‚Äì allowing them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food. === Reproduction and lifecycle === The Amazonian manatee is a seasonal breeder with a gestational period of 12‚Äì14 months and a prolonged calving period. Most births take place between December and July, with about 63% between February and May, during a time of rising river levels in their native region.Seasonal Breeding in the Amazonian Manatee, Trichechus inunguis (Mammalia: Sirenia) Robin C. Best Biotropica, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Mar., 1982), pp. 76-78 Published by: The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2387764 After the calf is born, it will begin to eat while staying with its mother for 12 ‚Äì 18 months. Two individuals lived 12.5 years in captivity. Wild individuals have a lifespan of about 30 years. ==Population and distribution== As of 1977 the population count of the Amazonian manatee was estimated to be around 10,000. As of now the total population count is undetermined, however the population trend seems to be decreasing. They are mainly distributed throughout the Amazon River Basin in northern South America, ranging from the Maraj√≥ Islands in Brazil through Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. They are occasionally found overlapping with the West Indian manatee along the coasts of Brazil. Amazonian manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, from the headwaters, in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Maraj√≥ Island) in Brazil over an estimated seven million square kilometers. However, their distribution is patchy, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km¬≤ They also inhabit environments in lowland tropical areas below 300 m asl, where there is large production of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants; they are also found in calm, shallow waters, away from human settlements The Amazonian manatee is completely aquatic and never leaves the water. It is the only manatee to occur exclusively in freshwater environments. The Amazonian manatee favors backwater lakes, oxbows, and lagoons with deep connections to large rivers and abundant aquatic vegetation They are mainly solitary but sometimes they will gather in small groups consisting of up to eight individuals. They engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water- bodies during the dry season Natural predators include jaguars, sharks, and crocodiles. ==Illegal Hunting== The main threat to the Amazonian manatee is illegal hunting. They are hunted for subsistent and local use, not commercially. The hunting has led to the large decline in the population and low population numbers. Between 1935 and 1954, over 140,000 manatees are estimated to have been killed. Despite the laws in place against hunting, hunting continues to occur even in protected areas. Traditional harpoons are most common weapon used against the manatees but in Ecuador they are also known to be caught in Arapaima fish traps. They are mainly hunted for their high value meat but the fat and skin are also used for cooking and in medicines. The meat is sold locally to neighbors or at produce markets. It can be illegally sold as sausage or mixira in public markets in Brazil and Ecuador. Mixira is a meat preserved in its own fat and is expensive which drives the hunters. Between 2011 and 2015, 195 manatees were killed for meat in a single region of Brazil. In another region, 460 were killed in a protected area between 2004 and 2014. ==Conservation== \\"IBAMA\\" on Maraj√≥ The IUCN red list ranks the Amazonian manatee as vulnerable. Population declines are primarily a result of hunting, as well as calf mortality, climate change, and habitat loss. However, due to their murky water habitat it is difficult to gain accurate population estimates. There are no national management plans for the Amazonian Manatee, except in Colombia. As of 2008, the INPA takes care of 34 captive manatees and the CPPMA is caring for 31 manatees. The manatee has been protected by Peruvian law since 1973, via Supreme Decree 934-73-AG, prohibiting hunting and commercial use of the manatee. Hunting remains the largest problem and continues in much of its range, even within reserves. In 1986, it was estimated that the hunting levels in Ecuador were unsustainable and it would be gone from this country within 10‚Äì15 years.Ecology, Distribution, Harvest, and Conservation of the Amazonian Manatee Trichechus inunguis in Ecuador. Robert M. Timm, Luis Albuja V. and Barbara L. Clauson. Biotropica, Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jun., 1986), pp. 150-156. Published by: The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation. Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388757 While hunting still occurs, an increasing risk to its continued survival in Ecuador is now believed to be the risk of oil spills. The oil exploration also means an increase in boat traffic on the rivers. The Amazonian manatees of Peru have experienced much of their decline due to hunting by human populations for meat, blubber, skin and other materials that can be collected from the manatee. Such hunting is carried out with harpoons, gillnets, and set traps. Much of this hunting occurs in the lakes and streams near the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in northeastern Peru. The species is slow-moving, docile, and is often found feeding at the surface of the lakes and rivers it inhabits. Manatees are also at risk from pollution, accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets, and the degradation of vegetation by soil erosion resulting from deforestation.

Insufficient venous return results in increased pressure in the capillaries with the result that both fluid and cells may \\"leak\\" out of the capillaries. This results in red cells breaking down, with iron containing hemosiderin possibly contributing to the pathology of this entity. == Symptoms == Stasis dermatitis may be characterized by: * Skin that appears thin, brown and tissue-like, with possible skin lesions (macule or patches), red spots, superficial skin irritation and/or darkening and/or thickening of the skin at the ankles or legs * Weak skin may ulcerate in some areas and legs, ankles, or other areas may become swollen * Open sores, ulcers * Itching and/or leg pains * Sometimes pain may persist from swollen tissues and may feel like \\"stabbing\\" or \\"needle pricks\\" If skin continues to deteriorate and breaks down, a venous ulcer (also known as a stasis ulcer) may form. Without proper wound care, open cracks predispose patients for the entry of a bacterial infection, causing cellulitis in the leg. ==Diagnosis== Stasis dermatitis is diagnosed clinically by assessing the appearance of red plaques on the lower legs and the inner side of the ankle. Stasis dermatitis can resemble a number of other conditions, such as cellulitis and contact dermatitis, and at times needs the use of a duplex ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis or if clinical diagnosis alone is not sufficient. == Treatment == Treatment may consist of topical applications of steroid based creams and the use of compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression pumps, to help force the underlying buildup of fluids back out of the lower leg. Compression therapy should consist of moderate pressures and works best for ambulating patients. Ultimately, treating the underlying venous reflux is necessary to treat Stasis dermatitis. Invasive surgical procedures like saphenofemoral junction ligation with stripping were the norm for treatment in the past. However, less invasive methods are now more widely used. These newer methods include endovenous thermal ablation, ambulatory phlebotomy, and ultrasound foam sclerotherapy.

The series consisted of the Volvo 340 (previously 343/345) and the later Volvo 360. __TOC__ ==Origins== Volvo 360 \\"notchback\\" saloon, side profile After building a series of compact cars, DAF sought a partner to bring its new larger model, codenamed P900 and intended to become the DAF 77, to market in 1970. Several manufacturers were approached, including Audi, BMW, and Volvo. Volvo was not originally interested due to the cost, but they were later persuaded by DAF's access to Renault engines. This helped Volvo expand its model line-up without the large expenditures associated with developing a new model. Building cars in the Netherlands also helped the Swedish Volvo to access the markets of the EEC, of which Sweden was then not yet a member. Volvo purchased a one-third share in DAF in 1973, increasing to a three-quarters stake in 1975; the DAF company's name was changed to Volvo Car BV that year. Free of its passenger car division, DAF's commercial vehicle division, DAF Trucks, still operates today, owned by Paccar since 1996. ==Design== DAF had begun development of this car in 1970 as Project P900, meant as a replacement for the DAF 66 and due to launch in 1975, probably as DAF 77. In 1971 four designs were presented anonymously to DAF employees, one by Bertone, one by Michelotti and two by DAF in-house designers. The design by DAF's designer John de Vries (who would later win a similar contest for the Volvo 480 design) was chosen. In 1972 Volvo bought a stake in DAF, followed by a takeover in 1975, and the design was gradually adapted to Volvo's own standards, though there were a lot of quality concerns. The 300 series was unusual in having the gearbox mounted to the De Dion tube rear axle as a transaxle, with the 2 liter models having the driveshaft enclosed in a \\"torque tube\\". The rear-mounted gearbox helped with weight distribution but resulted in an unusually large transmission tunnel, especially by comparison with then-contemporary front wheel drive competitors such as the Mk. III Ford Escort and the Opel Kadett E/Mk. II Vauxhall Astra. Overall, the 300 series was considered heavy and often underpowered, but reliable and safe by the standards of its day.Autocarriage & Performance Drivercar, March 1986. However, the 360 GLT versions were well regarded by more enthusiastic drivers, with the unusual gearbox location ensuring good weight distribution and unusually good balance and traction. The fuel tank was located ahead of the rear axle, straddling the rear-mounted transmission, the safest possible location and one that ensured consistent handling characteristics whether the tank is full or empty. ==Model chronology== 343 DL, 1980 model (before first bumper and front facelift) The Volvo 343 was introduced on 19 February 1976. The introduction model was fitted with a 1.4 litre1975 Volvo 343 Renault Cl√©on-Fonte engine in the front and DAF's radical Variomatic continuously variable transmission unusually mounted in the rear, helping weight distribution. The engine was an enlarged version of those already fitted to the DAF 55 and 66. To add to the appeal of the car and boost its sales, Volvo adapted the M45 manual transmission from the 200 series to fit in place of the CVT, and was sold alongside the CVT models from 1979. A five-door model, the 345, was added in August 1979 for the 1980 model year. The extra doors added ; other modifications included better brakes, a slightly larger track due to wider rims, and interval wipers. During 1980 larger wrap around bumpers were introduced. In 1981 another engine option was added to the range, the Volvo designed B19, only available in GLS-specs with the manual transmission. A revised bonnet, grille and front lamp arrangement and slightly different wings signalled a facelift in summer 1981 (for the 1982 model year), which also gave the car a new dashboard and revised interior. From having been mostly a DAF design, the dashboard gradually became more aligned with the design of other Volvos over the years.S√∂derlind, p. 49 The overall length crept up to . Volvo 345 DL, the five-door version, 1982 model The third digit designating the number of doors was dropped from model designations in model year 1983, when the rear seat also gained a little bit more space thanks to a shallower seat pad and a flatter plate beneath it. The more powerful 360 arrived that year with two 2.0 litre engine choices, Volvo's own B19A (360 GLS) and the fuel injected B19E. The B19A was also available in the 340 DL. The more powerful 360 GLT was only available with a five-speed manual and the engine came equipped with a breakerless ignition system and velour interior, amongst other comfort details. The 360 GLT can be recognized by its front spoiler with integrated extra lights, a rear spoiler, and by being lower. The 360s were four-cylinders and not sixes as implied by the name; the \\"360\\" name was used to \\"give the new model a stronger profile in the Volvo range.\\" This 2-litre 360 model was available in five-door and three-door hatchback form, with four-door \\"notchback\\" saloon models added in 1984. Trim levels were GL, GLE, or GLT, depending on output and specifications. In 1985, the 300 Series received a major facelift. Amongst other small changes, (optionally body coloured) wrap-around bumpers with the indicator repeaters attached to them were fitted. The taillights were also redesigned. Instrumentation changed from Smiths units to VDO. The older Volvo redblock engines in the 360 were upgraded to the low friction B200 unit. Capacities and outputs remained much the same. The carburettor version was designated B200K and the Bosch LE-Jet fuel injected version is known as the B200E. A famous advertisement for the 300 series in the late 1980s saw a crash test dummy \\"come alive\\", and drive a 340 out of a second floor factory window, nose-diving into the concrete ground. From 1987 on, incremental improvements in features and emissions control were made. The newly designed power steering from the new Volvo 480 became available as an option for the 1988 model year, while rust protection was improved with increased use of galvanized steel. Production of the 360 came to an end in 1990, while the 340 was discontinued in 1991, despite the fact it had supposedly been replaced by the Volvo 440 in 1987. The last ever car of the Volvo 300 series (a white Volvo 340) rolled off the production line on 13 March 1991, three years after the launch of the 400-series. ==Engines== The 300 Series had a choice of three petrol engines; a 1.4, 1.7, and a 2.0-litre. The 1.4 litre B14 was a Renault C-series OHV pushrod unit, and for the 360 there was the B200 (originally the earlier B19 version) 2.0-litre engine taken from the Volvo 240 with outputs varying from to . A new Renault F-series 1.7 litre petrol engine (designated the B172) was introduced in the 340 during the summer of 1985, following the range facelift, along with a 340 version of the saloon, which was only available with the new engine. There was also a catalyzed version (B172K) available later on, with . Volvo 360 GLT 1987 and 1988 A diesel engine for the 340 developing , was only available in select export markets and was added to the 340 models in 1984. This diesel was a Renault F-series (like the petrol 1.7), and was available with a 1.6 litre naturally aspirated engine only - called the \\"D16\\" in Volvo's internal parlance. While these diesel models were never offered in the UK, they were offered in right-hand drive form in Ireland. In 1985 a 360 diesel was made available with the same exact mechanics. The diesel was discontinued in 1989, which is when a 1.3-liter \\"tax special\\" was introduced for Finland, Italy, and Belgium. Volvo also experimented with LPG tanks, a feature of which was made available in 1979 with the Volvo 343 and 345 but they were limited in LPG availability. ==Sales== The 300-series was a strong seller for Volvo. Sales began at a low level, not helped by the absence of a manual transmission option, but gradually increased as the lineup expanded. 300-series cumulative production broke the 100,000 barrier on 12 December 1983, with the total reaching 102,000 before the end of the year. The 100,000th car, finished in white, was donated to the Dutch Red Cross. In 1988, 12 years after its introduction, the one millionth 300 was built. Finished inside and out in red, it ended up in the DAF museum in Eindhoven. Eventually, production of the 300 series ended in 1991 after 1.14 million units, averaging 76,000 vehicles per year throughout its life. While the car was fundamentally robust, the car was rushed to production too early. In particular the first (1976) model year 343 suffered from teething problems,, with unsubstantiated claims that Volvo ordered its dealer network to scrap early model year cars that were traded in, in order to remove them from circulation. As a result very few of the earliest 1976-77 cars have survived. The build quality gradually improved but was never up to the same standard as Volvo's larger models. Due to this bad reputation, the car wasn't very popular in Sweden. Sales of the 340 with Variomatic in Sweden were down to 200 per year in the late 1980s. The 300's sales were also held back by the fact that a two-litre 360 cost considerably more than a base 240 in the home market.Hogsten (17 November 1982), p. 30 The Volvo 300 has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years with a number of very active websites across Europe. A strong, young following has developed attracted by a rear wheel drive car which is very cheap to buy, insure and relatively easy to work on. In the UK, despite being unsuitable for professional drifting, many 300s (because of their low price) have found popularity amongst the amateur drifting community. Known as \\"trampdrifting,\\" old bangers are modified to drift at a minimal cost and are discarded once they reach the end of their usefulness. ===Markets=== Whilst not a major sales success, the Volvo badge ensured that the car had a strong middle-class following (often as a second car) in some places, particularly in the UK in the 1980s. It regularly made it onto Britain's top annual 20 sales tables for that decade and was the best selling import car at several points in the early years of the decade. They are robust and mechanically simple (and therefore easy to maintain). Variomatic transmissions are reliable given proper care. The rust protection was poorer than other Volvos, but the engines were quite durable. In February 2016, it was reported that 627 examples of the 300 Series were still in use on Britain's roads. 1985‚Äì1988 Volvo 360 GLT 5-door (Australia) The 300-series was not sold in North America. The Volvo 360GLT only was introduced in Australia and New Zealand during 1984, and lasted until 1988. ==Model designations and special editions== The 300 series was available in a variety of different trim levels throughout its production life. There were also a number of special editions produced throughout the lifetime of the 300 series as well. Phase 1 343s and 345s were available in DL, GL, DLS and GLS trim levels, whilst Phase 2 and 3 340s and 360s were available in the following range of trim levels: 340; 340DL; 340GL; 340GLE; 340 DLS; 340GLS 340 Blueline; 340 Redline; 360; 360GL; 360DLS; 360GLS; 360GLE; 360GLT. No market received all models. One such variation on a theme was the 343 R-Sport. This was intended as a sporty offering to the line-up, pre-dating the introduction of the 360GLT by some two years (the R-Sport was introduced in 1981). Only 100 cars were produced, being based on the DLS and GLS trim levels and featuring sporting additions such as self-adhesive 'R-Sport' decals, rev counter, front and rear spoilers and some featuring body coloured bumpers and alloy wheels. The B19A engine also featured some modifications, including twin Solex carburettors. Power was increased from a quoted 95HP to 122HP. A similar model was the 343 Oettinger. This model was based on the standard 343 DL, with the 1397 cc capacity increased to 1596 cc. The Oettinger was modified by the VW Group tuning company Oettinger, and was released in 1979. The 343 Oettinger was available in both red and silver metallic. Only 125 cars were produced. 1982 Volvo 345 Van front A van version also entered production. The van was essentially a five-door 340, but with the rear doors replaced with full body- coloured metal pieces and with the rear seats removed. A glazed version was also available. The cargo compartment has a flat floor and a metal bulkhead behind the front seats to protect occupants from moving loads. It was called \\"Volvo 345 Van\\" and was developed for commercial use at the behest of the Dutch Postal Services, who preferred a Dutch-made vehicle. It was first presented at a commercial vehicle show in Amsterdam in February 1982 and was also offered to the public. The only engine option was the petrol B14, combined with either the CVT or a four-speed manual. Another model of note is the Millionaire. This model was introduced in 1988 to commemorate the production of the one millionth car in the 300 series. Available on both the 340GLE and 360 GLE/T, the Millionaire model featured virtually a full specification including air conditioning, electric front windows and mirrors, alloy wheels and leather interior. ==Prototypes== 363 CS There are a few variations of the Volvo 300 series that never made production: The Volvo 340 estate and a convertible were both built as design studies, but neither was put into production. The convertible version of the Volvo 340 was mooted, but only exists as a clay model. However, a few 340 convertibles exist, as a result of aftermarket conversions carried out by specialist companies after purchase. Another model of note was the 363 CS. Named for 'Competition Services', to indicate a high-performance version, the 363 CS was based on the three-door bodyshell and fitted with the B27F 2.7 litre V6 PRV engine as used in the Volvo 260 series. The gearbox was a five-speed Alfa Romeo unit, as Volvo did not have a suitable design which would fit a transaxle-design. One prototype was built which was painted in metallic silver with black and orange 'Starsky and Hutch'-style stripes down both sides. Flared wheelarches and orange-painted, multi-spoke alloy wheels were also added to complete the sporty look. At the 1979 Geneva Motor Show, Bertone presented a three-door hatchback coup√© concept on 343-basis called the Volvo Tundra. The angular design was by Marcello Gandini and continued the themes developed for the Reliant (Anadol) FW11. ==Top Gear== Former Top Gear co‚Äìhost Jeremy Clarkson nurtured a long hatred for the 340. In 1992, on Top Gear, as a preamble to a road test of the then‚Äìnew Volvo 850, he dispatched a yellow 1981 example into a scrap metal shredder. In 1996, on his first own video feature, \\"Unleashed on Cars\\", he intentionally crashed one against a tree, as he pointed out Volvo's reputation for safety. ==The Volvo 300 Series in motorsport== Despite the 'geriatric' image the 300-series gained over the years, it had some quite successful appearances in motorsport. For instance, a heavily tuned version (using Alpine/Gordini cross-flow engines bored out to 1770 cc) was driven by Per-Inge Walfridsson to win the European Championship of Rallycross in 1980. It also gained homologation for rallying in Sweden's Standard-B class (minimum weight of 15 kg/ps) in the spring of 1977, with some minor modifications to the engine and gearing. In the UK, several Volvo 360 GLT models can be seen in action on Road-Rally events. The Volvo 360 GLT also participated in a 24-hour endurance record breaking run at the Surfers Paradise raceway in Queensland, Australia to showcase the introduction of the model in Australia in 1984. This exact same Volvo 360 GLT was later converted to rallying specifications and participated in many Australia rally events and is still running in 2009 as a rally car. ==References== * Matras, John.

Consequently, the Soviet Mineral Oil Administration (Sowjetische Mineral√∂lverwaltung, SMV), a corporation formed during the Soviet zone of occupation in post-war Austria became ‚Äú√ñsterreichische Mineral√∂lverwaltungs Aktiengesellschaft‚Äù. Four years later, in 1960, the company opened the Schwechat refinery near Vienna, in 1968 the first natural gas supply contract with the former USSR were entered. At the end of 1987, 15% of OMV was privatised, making it the first public listing of a state-owned company in Austria. In 1998, OMV acquired a 25% stake in plastics group, Borealis. In 1990 the company opened its first filling station in Vienna-Auhof on 26 June 1990. The International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) of Abu Dhabi acquired an initial 19.6% interest in the group at the end of 1994. The following year, the group changed its name from \\"√ñMV\\" to \\"OMV\\" because the umlaut on the \\"√ñ\\" is not commonly used in many languages. In the early 2000s, OMV expanded into Eastern Europe, by acquiring around 10% of Hungarian oil company, MOL and in 2003 it acquired the upstream division of Germany's Preussag Energie, expanding its filling station networks. OMV oil refinery in Schwechat (near Vienna) In 2004, OMV became the market leader in Central and Eastern Europe following the acquisition of 51% of Romanian oil and gas group Petrom which constitutes the largest acquisition in OMV's history. In the same year, OMV increased its share capital, meaning that more than 50% of the company's shares were in free float for the first time. Following the sale of 50% of the subsidiary company Agrolinz Melamine International GmbH to IPIC in 2005, the Borealis group was taken over in full together with IPIC. In 2006, OMV acquired a 34% stake in Turkish oil company Petrol Ofisi. In the same year, the board members of OMV and Verbund, the Austrian utility group announced plans for a merger. However, this collapsed due to resistance from Austrian MPs. OMV increased its stake in Hungarian oil group MOL to 20.2% in 2007. OMV then sold its entire stake in March 2009 after MOL rejected a takeover bid in 2008 and the European Commission imposed tough restrictions for an approval of the deal. OMV acquired the stake held by Dogan Holding in Petrol Ofisi in late 2010, which further increased its stake in the company to 95.75%.

At the end of 2016, OMV Upstream was active in 15 countries across the globe and had proven reserves (1P) of 1.03 bn boe and proven and probable reserves (2P) of 1.7 bn boe. The Reserve Replacement Rate (RRR) was 101% in 2016. Daily production was 311 kboe/d in 2016, which equals a total production of 113.8 mn boe. Around 90% of its production in 2016 came from EU/OECD countries. The oil/gas split in production is roughly 50/50. ===Downstream=== Downstream Oil operates three refineries: Schwechat (Austria) and Burghausen (Germany), both of which feature with integrated petrochemical production, as well as the Petrobrazi refinery (Romania) which processes predominantly Romanian crude. OMV has an annual refining capacity of 17.8 mn t by the end of 2016. The retail network consists of more than 2,000 filling stations in 10 countries with a strong brand portfolio. Together with a high-quality non-oil retail business (VIVA) and an efficient commercial business, OMV has a leading position in its markets. In Downstream Gas, the natural gas sales volumes amounted to 109 TWh in 2016. OMV operates a gas pipeline network in Austria and owns gas storage facilities with a capacity of 2.7 bcm (30 TWh). The Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) is a well-established gas trading platform The gas distribution node in Baumgarten is Central Europe's largest entry and gas distribution point for Russian gas. OMV also operates two gas-fired power plants, one in Romania and one Turkey. ==Controversies== ===War crimes in Sudan=== In June 2010, the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) published the report \\"Unpaid Debt\\", that called upon the governments of Sweden, Austria, and Malaysia to look into allegations that OMV, Lundin Petroleum, and Petronas may have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity whilst operating in Block 5A, South Sudan (then Sudan), during the period 1997-2003. The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement. When the consortium that OMV took part in operated in Block 5A, approximately 12,000 people died and 160,000 were violently displaced from their land and homes, many forever. Satellite pictures taken between 1994 and 2003 show that the activities of OMV in Sudan coincided with a spectacular drop in agricultural land use in its concession area. In June 2010, the Swedish public prosecutor for international crimes opened a criminal investigation into links between Sweden and the reported crimes. In 2016, Lundin Petroleum's Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter were informed that they were the suspects of the investigation. Sweden's Government gave the green light for the Public Prosecutor in October 2018 to indict the two top executives On 1 November 2018, the Swedish Prosecution Authority notified Lundin Petroleum AB that the company may be liable to a corporate fine and forfeiture of economic benefits of SEK 3,285 (app. ‚Ç¨315 million) for involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Consequently, the company itself will also be charged, albeit indirectly, and will be legally represented in court. On 15 November 2018 the suspects were served with the draft charges and the case files. They will be indicted for aiding and abetting international crimes and may face life imprisonment if found guilty. The trial is likely to open in the Autumn of 2020 and may take two years. The Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon OMV and its shareholders to pay off their debt to them. A conviction in Sweden may provide some level of remedy and reparation for the few victims of human rights violations who will testify in court, but not for the other 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. The Swedish court cannot impose obligations upon OMV. On 23 May 2019, the T.M.C. Asser Institute for International Law in The Hague organized the conference 'Towards criminal liability of corporations for human rights violations: The Lundin case in Sweden'. OMV endorses the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, acknowledging the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to. The company has never publicly showed an interest in the adverse impacts of its activities on the communities in its concession area. According to the Dutch peace organisation PAX, the companies OMV, Lundin Petroleum, Petronas, as well as their shareholders are disregarding the human rights standards that they claim to respect, notably the OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles, because they, A. never conducted an appropriate due diligence for their Sudanese operations; B. made no effort to know their human rights impacts; and C. do not show how they address alleged adverse human rights impacts. OMV (Sudan) Exploration GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of OMV AG, held a 26.1% share in the consortium that acquired the right to explore and develop oil deposits in Block 5A. It sold its Sudanese assets in 2004 with a net profit of $55 million. As the operator of the consortium, Lundin Petroleum was responsible for day-to-day management but its managers stood under the supervision of the Operating Committee, that exercised \\"overall direction and control of all matters pertaining to the Joint Operations and the Joint Property\\". OMV was permanently represented in the Operating Committee and has never publicly distanced itself from any of its decisions.Joint Operating Agreement between IPC Sudan Limited and Petronas Carigali Overseasn Sdn Bhd and OMV (SUDAN) Exploration GmbH and Sudapet Ltd. SUDAN BLOCK 5A, 7 April 1999. Between 2001 and 2003, OMV met repeatedly with European human rights advocates led by Sudan Platform Austria, but the company took no effective measures to prevent involvement in human rights violations or undo the adverse impact of its consortium's operations. On April 6, 2001, OMV wrote to Human Rights Watch: ‚ÄúWe have reached the conclusion that, despite problems, the influx of oil revenues could improve the social and humanitarian conditions of the Sudanese. Oil exploration activities also represent immediate benefits to the local population, in terms of employment, infrastructure developments and humanitarian assistance... Our role is to constantly monitor the situation on the ground and to turn our perception of business ethics into reality by responsible action. In 2002, OMV nevertheless commissioned an independent report on the human rights situation in Block 5A, that has not been made public.Louis Charbonneau, ‚ÄúOMV studying human rights situation in Sudan,‚Äù Reuters, Vienna, July 11, 2002 OMV was a loyal participant in the consortium that operated in Block 5A and had a substantial say in the way it operated. The suspicions against the consortium's top managers therefore also concern OMV. The Austrian State's owns 31% of OMV's shares. According to the UN Guiding Principles, which is endorsed by Austria, an abuse of human rights by a business enterprise that is wholly or partially controlled by a State, may entail a violation of that State's own international law obligations.UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, p. 7. ===Petrom=== The acquisition of 51% stake in Petrom was considered controversial as the privatisation contract was not made public and it consists of several disputed clauses. The privatisation allegedly produced a market monopoly. Critics say that OMV can use the resources Petrom owns until their exhaustion. Also fixing of tax for gas and oil exploration at 3 to 13.5 percent from the final delivery price for 10 years was criticised. Some critics claimed, that the price ‚Ç¨1.5 billion was too low. ===MOL=== In June 2007 OMV made an unsolicited bid to take over MOL, which was rejected by the Hungarian company. MOL criticised OMV's advertisement in which OMV had suggested the two had already worked together on the European market. MOL thought that to be misleading and unethical and asked OMV to remove the name MOL from those advertisements. OMV dismissed its bid after negative results of the investigation by the European competition authorities. OMV sold its entire stake to Surgutneftegas in March 2009. ===New Zealand=== On 10 April 2019 OMV announced that it would drill up to ten wells off the Otago, New Zealand coast. The decision was met with indications by local environmental groups, who had successfully fought previous attempts to drill for fossil fuels in the area, that OMV could \\"expect resistance\\". In November 2019 an OMV supply vessel in Timaru was occupied for 57 hours by 27 protesters, and 16 people were arrested. In March 2020 two members of Extinction Rebellion ≈åtautahi intercepted and boarded an OMV mobile drilling rig in the Marlborough Sounds from an inflatable boat, intending to occupy it for a week, but their equipment was confiscated by crew and they abandoned the occupation after 14 hours. They were flown to New Plymouth and served with a trespass notice. ==See also== *List of petroleum companies *OMV Petrom *Petrol Ofisi ==References√ñBIB * OMV Petrom * Borealis * Gas Connect Austria * Central European Gas Hub *Vienna Stock Exchange: Market Data OMV AG Category:Oil and gas companies of Austria Category:Companies based in Vienna Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1956 Category:Austrian brands Category:Companies listed on the Wiener B√∂rse Category:Companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Category:Energy companies established in 1956 Category:Austrian companies established in 1956 Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Austria ","title":"OMV"},{"id":"1299206","text":"Nightwatchman may refer to: * Watchman (law enforcement) * Nightwatchman (cricket), a lower-order batsman who comes in to bat higher up the order than usual near the end of the day's play * \\"Nightwatchman\\", a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from Hard Promises * The Nightwatchman, or Tom Morello, a musician * Night-watchman state, a government ideal restricted to the upholding of negative rights * a Security guard who works at night * Nightwatchman (film), a 2000 Italian film * Street Kings or The Night Watchman, a 2008 film == See also == * Watchman (disambiguation) * Night Watch (disambiguation) ","title":"Nightwatchman"},{"id":"1299208","text":"Henry Cecil Raikes PC (18 November 1838 ‚Äì 24 August 1891) was a British Conservative Party politician.

New York: Routledge, 2003. p. 71 The term was formulated as a position by sociologists J√ºrgen Habermas and Irving Louis Horowitz. Another early use of the term is by Victor Klemperer, when describing the close similarities between Nazi Germany and the German Democratic Republic. == Usage == In 1960, Seymour Martin Lipset classified some nationalist and authoritarian regimes in underdeveloped countries as left-wing fascist, namely in South America, like those led by Juan Per√≥n in Argentina and Getulio Vargas in Brazil, characterized by an appeal to the working classes against the upper classes, and accusing the latter of being guilty for the underdevelopment of the country and for the subjection to foreign interests.

Winners and Losers: Social and Political Polarities in America (Duke University Press, 1984). . . ch. 17. p. 209. Lenin describes the enemies of the working class as opportunists and petty-bourgeois revolutionaries operating on anarchist premises.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term left fascism has been used to describe unusual hybrid political alliances.TELOS (fall 2008). no. 144.

Glasser was the developer of W. Edwards Deming's workplace ideas, reality therapy and choice theory. His innovations for individual counseling, work environments and school, highlight personal choice, personal responsibility and personal transformation. Glasser positioned himself in opposition to conventional mainstream psychiatrists, who focus instead on classifying psychiatric syndromes as \\"illnesses\\" and prescribe psychotropic medications to treat mental disorders. Based on his wide-ranging and consulting clinical experience, Glasser applied his theories to broader social issues, such as education, management, and marriage, to name a few. As a public advocate, Glasser warned the general public of potential detriments caused by older generations of psychiatry, wedded to traditional diagnosing of patients as having mental illnesses (brain disorders) and prescribing medications. In his view, patients simply act out their unhappiness and lack of meaningful personal connection with important people in their life. Glasser advocated educating the general public about mental health issues; offering, post-modern frameworks for finding and following healthy therapeutic direction. ==Early life and career== Glasser was born on May 11, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ben Glasser, a watch and clock repairman, and his wife Betty. He attended Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where in 1945 he earned his BS in chemical engineering. After a short career as an engineer, Glasser returned in 1946 to Case Western, but instead, during his first semester, was drafted into the US Army and stationed at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. He returned to Case Western in 1947, earning his MA in clinical psychology in 1949 and his MD in psychiatry in 1953. He completed his medical internship and psychiatric residency at UCLA and the Veterans Administration Hospital, respectively, and became board certified in 1961. After being \\"thrown off the staff\\" at the VA hospital due to his anti-Freudian beliefs, Glasser took a position as staff psychiatrist at the Ventura School for Delinquent Girls, where he began teaching ideas that became the basis for reality therapy. During this time, Glasser met G. L. Harrington, an older psychiatrist who openly disbelieved the Freudian model of mental illness, whom Glasser credits as being his \\"mentor\\". Glasser set up a private psychotherapy practice in Los Angeles, which he maintained until 1986. ==Work== Glasser authored and co-authored numerous and influential books on mental health, counseling, school improvement, and teaching, and several publications advocating a public health approach to or emphasis within mental health versus the prevailing \\"medical\\" model. Glasser founded the Institute for Reality Therapy in 1967, which was renamed the Institute for Control Theory, Reality Therapy and Lead Management in 1994 and later the William Glasser Institute in 1996 in Chatsworth, CA. The institute is now located in Tempe, Arizona, and has branch institutes throughout the world. By the 1970s Glasser called his body of work \\"Control Theory\\". By 1996, the theoretical structure evolved into a comprehensive body of work renamed \\"Choice Theory\\", mainly because of the confusion with perceptual control theory by William T. Powers, developed in the 1950s. ==Reality therapy organizations== In the United States, the Glasser Institute was originally organized with regional groups in New England, the Sunbelt, the Northwest, the Midwest, the Southeast, and the West Coast. In July 2010 the William Glasser Association International (WGAI) was established in Nashville, Kentucky, with an interim governing board charged with setting up the organization to coordinate worldwide activities and conferences, the first of which was in 2012 in Los Angeles. The board eventually became incorporated in California under the new name of William Glasser International (WGI) and is the umbrella body recognised by Glasser to represent his ideas around the world. The members of the WGI Board are elected by members. Outside of the United States, William Glasser International (WGI) has active affiliate organizations in many countries including Canada, Croatia, Slovenia, Ireland, the UK, Finland, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Central and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Neither WGI nor its affiliate organisations confer titles such as \\"counsellor\\" or \\"therapist\\" in their regular certification courses. In Europe, however, there are two special courses offering by the European Institute for Reality Therapy, one leading to the title Reality Therapy Psychotherapist and the other to obtain the title Reality Therapy Counsellor. Both can lead to The European Certificate in Psychotherapy (ECP). The William Glasser Institute UK (formally Institute for Reality Therapy UK), with its own administration executive, coordinates the faculty workshops and practicums in the United Kingdom on behalf of WGI International, leading up to and including Reality Therapy Certification (CTRTC). The WGI UK strives to promote and develop choice theory, reality therapy, and lead management in the UK, offering guidance and support to its membership made up of a body of like-minded individuals, committed to their own personal and professional advancement. Support is offered by a team of training and practicum supervisors. Members of the institute subscribe to the \\"ethos\\" that Choice Theory, Reality Therapy, and Lead Management guide and support their relationships both on a personal and professional basis, and that Reality Therapy should be taught with integrity and adherence to fundamental concepts as described by Glasser and others who write, teach, and are associated with WG International. ==Death== Glasser died at his home in Los Angeles on August 23, 2013, in the company of his wife, Carleen, and others. Glasser's obituary reported the cause of death as respiratory failure stemming from pneumonia. The William Glasser Institute website referred to Glasser's death as \\"a massive shock to all\\", despite him having been \\"in poor health for some time\\". ==Bibliography== *Mental Health or Mental Illness?

The tunnel carries two lanes of European Route E16 and represents the final link on the main highway connecting Oslo and Bergen without ferry connections and difficult mountain crossings during winter. It is the longest road tunnel in the world, succeeding the Swiss Gotthard Road Tunnel. In 1975, the Parliament of Norway decided that the main road between Oslo and Bergen would run via Filefjell. In 1992, Parliament confirmed that decision, made the further decision that the road should run through a tunnel between L√¶rdal and Aurland, and passed legislation to build the tunnel. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian krone ($113.1M USD). ==Design== A total of of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000. The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland and goes through a mountain range and ends south of L√¶rdals√∏yri in L√¶rdal. The design of the tunnel takes into consideration the mental strain on drivers, so the tunnel is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves at intervals. While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise. The caves are meant to break the routine, providing a refreshing view and allowing drivers to take a short rest. The caverns are also used as turnaround points and for break areas to help lift claustrophobia during a 20-minute drive through the tunnel. In the tunnel, there is a sign on every kilometer indicating how many kilometers have already been covered, and also how many kilometers there are still to go. To keep drivers from being inattentive or falling asleep, each lane is supplied with a loud rumble strip towards the centre. ===Safety=== The tunnel does not have emergency exits. There are many safety precautions in case of accidents or fire. Emergency phones marked \\"SOS\\" are every for contacting the police, fire departments, and hospitals. Fire extinguishers are placed every . Whenever an emergency phone in the tunnel is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading: snu og k√∏yr ut () are displayed throughout the tunnel and two electronic signs on both sides of the entrance reading: tunnelen stengt (English: Tunnel closed). There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers. In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every . There are photo inspections and counting of all vehicles that enter and exit the tunnel at security centres in L√¶rdal and Bergen. There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones. Speed cameras have been installed because of serious speeding. There are very few other completely straight roads in the region. ===Air quality=== High air quality in the tunnel is achieved in two ways: ventilation and purification. Large fans draw air in from both entrances, and polluted air is expelled through the ventilation tunnel to Tynjadalen. The L√¶rdal Tunnel is the first in the world to be equipped with an air treatment plant, located in a wide cavern about northwest of Aurlandsvangen. The plant removes both dust and nitrogen dioxide from the tunnel air. Two large fans draw air through the treatment plant, where dust and soot are removed by an electrostatic filter. Then the air is drawn through a large carbon filter, which removes the nitrogen dioxide. ==Media gallery== Alfa Romeo 147 tunnel.JPGA car parked in one of the tunnel caves Laerdalstunnel cave.jpgView of one of the caves L√¶rdalstunnel.jpgOne of the L√¶rdalstunnel caves has blue lighting with yellow lights L√¶rdalstunnelen ‚Äì der l√§ngste Stra√üentunnel der Welt.JPGNorth portal Laerdalstunnelen.jpgSouth portal ==References== ==External links== *World's longest Tunnel Page Category:Aurland Category:L√¶rdal Category:Road tunnels in Vestland Category:2000 establishments in Norway Category:Tunnels completed in 2000 Category:European Route E16 in Norway ","title":"L√¶rdal Tunnel"},{"id":"1299250","text":"Krak√≥w is considered by many to be the cultural capital of Poland.

As it is in the United States, Canada or most countries in Europe, larger/wider highways have higher speed limits than normal urban roads (typically between 80 km/h and 120 km/h), although minor highways, unpaved highways and sections of major highways running inside urban areas have a lower speed limit in general. The national speed limit for cars driving in non-urban roads is 110 km/h unless otherwise stated, regardless of the road design, weather or daylight. Brazilian Federal police patrol on a Brazilian highway ==Nomenclature== SP-160, or Rodovia dos Imigrantes Brazilian Regional highways are named YY-XXX, where YY is the abbreviation of the state where the highway is running in and XXX is a number (e.g. SP-280; where SP means that the highway is under S√£o Paulo state administration). Brazilian National highways are named BR-XXX. National highways connect multiple states altogether, are of major importance to the national economy and/or connect Brazil to another country. The meaning of the numbers are: *000-099 - it means that the highway runs radially from Bras√≠lia. It is an exception to the cases below. *100-199 - it means that the highway runs in a south-north way *200-299 - it means that the highway runs in a west- east way *300-399 - it means that the highway runs in a diagonal way. Highways with odd numbers run northeast-southwest, while even numbers run northwest- southeast. *400-499 - it means that the highway interconnects two major highways. Often Brazilian highways receive names (famous people, etc.), but continue to have a YY/BR-XXX name (example: Rodovia Castelo Branco is also SP-280). See highway system of S√£o Paulo for numbering designation for S√£o Paulo state roads, also used in some other states. ==Growth, net density, importance and problems== divided highways highlighted in red. The S√£o Paulo state, which has state control of federal roads in its territory, makes its road network the best in the country. In 1953, Adhemar de Barros, then governor of S√£o Paulo, finished Via Anchieta, linking Santos to S√£o Paulo, and Via Anhanguera, linking S√£o Paulo to Campinas. When Juscelino Kubitschek assumed the presidency, he created subsidies to bring multinationals like Volkswagen to Brazil and created thousand of miles of roads, linking distant regions of the country. In 1967, the first stretch of Via Castelo Branco (SP-280), a 2X3 and 2X2 limited-access highway built at par with standards drawn by FHWA, linking the city of S√£o Paulo to the western region of the S√£o Paulo State, was finished, creating a standard for other highways in the same state. In the same year, the Via Dutra was modernized, between S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The country would reach 200,000 km of paved roads in 2000. Between 1995 and 2005 three major highways were modernised; (BR-101, linking Curitiba to Porto Alegre; Via Regis Bittencourt, linking S√£o Paulo to Curitiba; and Via Fern√£o Dias, linking S√£o Paulo to Belo Horizonte). The Southern and Southeast regions of Brazil are heavily connected by highways, most of them paved; the North region is the least connected with paved highways due to the presence of the Amazon rainforest. In this region, highways, when they are present, generally are unpaved. Manaus, for example, has no major paved highways connecting it to any other city but Boa Vista in the north. ==Motorways== Due to the country's growth and the associated traffic increase, the Government has started the construction and adaptation of main road sections into motorways. The first one to be completed was the so-called Via Dutra (BR-116), the important highway connecting S√£o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, which was finished on the 1975 with a 2X2 setting, but retained some grade crossings. Later, other roads were built or expanded to dual carriageways, like the Via Fern√£o Dias, connecting Belo Horizonte to S√£o Paulo; the Via Bandeirantes, connecting S√£o Paulo to the State's countryside; the Via Litoral Sul, connecting Curitiba to Florian√≥polis, and a few others. The projects are the link between Bras√≠lia and Belo Horizonte (800 km), Belo Horizonte and Juiz de Fora (close to the Minas Gerais-Rio de Janeiro State Border), with 200 km, the Rio-Bahia Road System, between Tr√™s Rios (app. 150 km from Rio de Janeiro City, already connected to the State Capital by a dual carriageway road) and Feira de Santana (app. 200 km from Salvador, also connected by a dual carriageway road), and the important connection between Palmares and Salvador. ==Major Federal Brazilian Highways== The Rio‚ÄìNiter√≥i Bridge, officially part of the federal BR-101 highway. Also a landmark of Rio de Janeiro ===BR-010=== BR-010 in Maranh√£o. The BR-010 is a radial highway that connects the national capital Bras√≠lia, to the city of Bel√©m, in the state of Par√°. It has the official name of Rodovia Bernardo Say√£o (the name of its chief engineer, who died in an accident during the construction of the highway, when a tree fell on him), and is also called Bel√©m-Bras√≠lia Highway or as Transbrasiliana Highway, in the stretch between the city of Estreito, in the state of Maranh√£o, and the city of Bel√©m. This is due to the fact that between Bras√≠lia and Estreito, the highway has many incomplete and unpaved stretches, especially in the state of Tocantins. Between Bras√≠lia and Estreito, the original route of the Bel√©m-Bras√≠lia Highway follows the BR-060, the BR-153 and the BR-226 highways, which are completely paved in this stretch. The BR-010 passes through the Federal District, and the states of Goi√°s, Tocantins, Maranh√£o and Par√°. ===BR-040=== BR-040 in Minas Gerais BR-040 runs radially from near the national capital Bras√≠lia (beginning 100 km south of the beginning of BR-050, in Bras√≠lia), in a northwest-southeast way, to Rio de Janeiro city. BR-040 is the modern way of the so-called \\"Caminho Novo\\", opened in the 18th century that linked Ouro Preto, the main center of gold mines of Minas Gerais to the Rio de Janeiro harbor. In 1861 the road was paved from Petr√≥polis to Juiz de Fora, becoming the first road paved in Latin America until the 1920s. In 1928, Petr√≥polis was connected to Rio de Janeiro with a paved road. In the 1930s the route was changed to pass by the new capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, although it was unpaved until 1957, when the road was extended to Bras√≠lia, the new capital of Brazil. From 1951 to 1973 BR-040 was called BR-3 and was famous for its dangerous bends, such as the Viaduto das Almas, near Belo Horizonte, disabled in 2010. In the 1970s the part from Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora was modernized and became a two-laned road. Cities where the BR-040 runs or passes by: Luisl√¢ndia, Belo Horizonte, Juiz de Fora, Rio de Janeiro. ===BR-050=== BR-050 between S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais BR-050 runs radially from the national capital, Bras√≠lia, in a north- south way, to Santos city, passing in S√£o Paulo. Cities where the BR-050 runs or passes by: Bras√≠lia, Uberl√¢ndia and Uberaba. At the border of the state of S√£o Paulo, it merges with Rodovia Anhanguera (SP-330) and passes by Ribeir√£o Preto, Campinas, Jundia√≠ and S√£o Paulo, then it merges with Rodovia Anchieta (SP-150) and passes by S√£o Bernardo do Campo and Santos. ===BR-101=== BR-101 between Para√≠ba and Rio Grande do Norte BR-101 runs in a north-south way, along Brazil's eastern coast. It is Brazil's second major highway, and the longest in the country (nearly 4800 km long). It connects more states capitals than any other \\"rodovia\\" in the country, in the total, 12 capitals are directly connected by BR-101. The Rio‚ÄìNiter√≥i Bridge is part of the BR-101. Cities where the BR-101 runs or passes by: Natal, Jo√£o Pessoa, Olinda, Recife, Macei√≥, Aracaju, Feira de Santana, Itabuna, Ilh√©us, Porto Seguro, Linhares, Vit√≥ria, Guarapari, Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro, Barra Mansa, Santos, Curitiba, Joinville, Florian√≥polis, Crici√∫ma, Os√≥rio. ===BR-116=== BR-116 in Cear√°. BR-116 runs in a north-south way, near, but not on Brazil's coastline. It is the major Brazilian highway, and it is the second longest of the country. Numerous parts of the long path taken by the BR-116 have other official names. The highway is especially busy along the Joinville-Curitiba-S√£o Paulo-Rio de Janeiro section. The Curitiba-S√£o Paulo section of the highway is known as Rodovia R√©gis Bittencourt, nicknamed \\"Rodovia da Morte\\" (Highway of death), due to its many accidents caused by the unstable weather conditions of the region. The S√£o Paulo-Rio de Janeiro section is named Rodovia Presidente Dutra, and it is the busiest section of the highway, running into or near of 15 cities with more than 200.000 inhabitants. Cities where the BR-116 runs or passes by: Fortaleza, Salgueiro, Feira de Santana, Vit√≥ria da Conquista, Te√≥filo Otoni, Governador Valadares, Rio de Janeiro, Volta Redonda, S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, S√£o Paulo, Curitiba, Lages, Canoas, Porto Alegre. ===BR-153=== Also called as Transbrasiliana Highway, as Bel√©m-Bras√≠lia Highway or even as Bernardo Say√£o Highway, the BR-153 is one of the longest highways in South America and runs in the north-south direction, connecting the city of Marab√°, in the state of Par√°, and the city of Acegu√°, in the boundary with Uruguay. It passes through the states of Par√°, Tocantins, Goi√°s, Minas Gerais (Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro region), S√£o Paulo, Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. The BR-153 is one of the main highways of the central region of Brazil, mainly in the states of Goi√°s and Tocantins, and also in the Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro region. ===BR-174=== BR-174 in Roraima BR-174 is the only paved highway connecting Manaus to another Brazilian state capital. It starts in Manaus, passes into Rorain√≥polis, Caracara√≠, Mucaja√≠, Boa Vista and Pacaraima, in the extreme north of the country, connecting Brazil with the neighbouring country of Venezuela. And also to several villages in Venezuela, also crosses the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory, located in the border between Amazonas and Roraima. This section of highway is closed at night and motorists are advised not to stop inside the reserve. ===BR-230 (Rodovia Transamaz√¥nica)=== BR-230 in Para√≠ba BR-230 or Rodovia Transamaz√¥nica is Brazil's third longest highway, running in an east-west direction. It was planned and built in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, to connect the isolated state of Amazonas and region with the rest of the country. It was planned to be more or less 8,000 km long, mostly paved and connecting the North and Northeast Brazilian regions to Ecuador and Peru, but nowadays it is 2,500 km long and mostly unpaved (dirt). BR-230 was inaugurated on August 30, 1972, and since then did not suffer any major alterations. Other problems were the beginning of deforestation and the creation of numerous small villages along the highway, and traffic is impracticable during the rainy season of the year (October‚ÄìMarch). Still, the highway is very important, by connecting the region with the rest of the country. A major plan to pave most of the highway is under consideration by the Brazilian government, as of 2004. Cities where the highway run or passes by: Aguiarn√≥polis, Araguatins, Marab√°, Altamira, Itaituba, Humait√°, L√°brea. ===BR-232=== BR-232 in Pernambuco BR-232 is a highway that runs east-west, starting in Recife - Pernambuco and goes up to west ending in Parnamirim. It is of major importance to Pernambuco, since it connects almost all its interior with the capital Recife to east and with the Amazonas region to west. It has double lanes between Recife and Caruaru (160 km W). Major cities connected by the BR-232: Recife, Jaboat√£o dos Guararapes, Gravat√°, Caruaru, Belo Jardim, Arcoverde, Serra Talhada, Salgueiro and Parnamirim. BR-232 is approximately 554 km long and inter-connects with 9 Federal Highways of vital importance to the Northeast of Brazil: BR-101, BR-408, BR-104, BR-423, BR-424, BR-110, BR-426, BR-116 and BR-316. ===BR-277=== BR-277 in Paran√° BR-277 is a highway that runs east-west, starting from the Friendship Bridge (which connects Brazil with Paraguay) and goes up to Paranagu√°. It is of major importance to Paraguay, since major importations are made using the Paranagu√° seaport. Major cities connected by the BR-277: Foz do Igua√ßu, Medianeira, Cascavel, Guarapuava, Ponta Grossa, Curitiba, Paranagu√°. BR-277 is approximately 650 km long. ===BR-319=== One of the two major highways connecting the isolated capital city of Manaus, it is mostly unpaved, and as a result, traffic is impracticable in the rainy seasons of the year. Despite this, BR-319 is a major highway of national significance because it connects Manaus to the southern regions of the country (which have greater population density). Major cities connected by the BR-319: Manaus (by ferry from Careiro da V√°rzea), Caiero, Humait√°, Porto Velho. ===BR-381=== BR-381 or Rodovia Fern√£o Dias, as it is called, is a highway which runs in the Brazilian states of S√£o Paulo and southern and eastern regions of Minas Gerais.

It was their first album to feature singer-songwriter Sandy Denny. The album also showed a move towards the folk rock for which the band became noted, including tracks later to become perennial favourites such as \\"Fotheringay\\" and the song traditionally used to close live concerts, \\"Meet on the Ledge\\". ==History== Following the departure of Judy Dyble, the band conducted auditions for a replacement singer, and Sandy Denny became the obvious choice. Simon Nicol has said \\"it was a one horse race really... she stood out like a clean glass in a sink full of dirty dishes\\". According to author Richie Unterberger Denny's \\"haunting, ethereal vocals gave Fairport a big boost\\". The album has been described by Unterberger as \\"a near-ideal balance between imaginative reworkings of traditional folk songs ... quality covers of contemporary folk-rock singer-songwriters, some quite obscure ... and original folk-rock material by various members\\". In 2008 Simon Nicol described the album as his favourite, and it was voted number 281 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). The cover features a sketch of the band performing, described in the album credits as \\"from a blackboard assaulted by Fairport Convention\\"Liner notes and the reverse of the original sleeve show a photograph of the band performing. The Island Masters 1990 re- release IMCD 97 also features a portrait of Sandy Denny. In the USA, the album was released by A&M; Records (SP-4185) with an identical track listing but featuring new cover art, and was re-titled Fairport Convention. The album was also released in Australia and New Zealand by Festival Records with the ‚Äòblackboard‚Äô front cover and an entirely different back cover to both the US and UK releases. The Discogs website gives no less than 54 different versions of the album. ==Reception and influence== In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, American critic Robert Christgau deemed Fairport Convention the \\"most interesting unknown group\\" he had listened to in some time, highlighting their take on \\"Pentangle-style ballads\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"I'll Keep It with Mine\\". Neal Casal, of Ryan Adams & the Cardinals, later listed What We Did on Our Holidays as one of his favourite albums of all time. Reviewing the 2008 re-issue of the album Pitchfork.com said: \\"The album mixes new interpretations of traditional ballads like \\"Nottamun Town\\", here rendered almost as a raga, with much newer songs, such as their soulful take on Dylan's \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\" and their ponderous version of Mitchell's \\"Eastern Rain\\". The best material on Holidays, though, may be their own-- the stomping blues-rock of \\"Mr. Lacey\\", the racing \\"No Man's Land\\", and the stirring afterlife anthem \\"Meet on the Ledge\\". == 1999 album == The album title was re-used for the 1999 CD release What We Did on Our Holidays - An Introduction to Fairport Convention on Island Records as IMCD 263. ==Track listing== == Personnel == ===Fairport Convention=== * Sandy Denny (as Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny) ‚Äì vocals, acoustic & 12-string acoustic guitars, organ, piano, harpsichord * Iain Matthews ‚Äì vocals, congas * Richard Thompson ‚Äì electric, acoustic & 12-string acoustic guitars, piano accordion, sitar on \\"Book Song\\" (uncredited), vocals * Ashley Hutchings ‚Äì bass, backing vocals * Simon Nicol ‚Äì electric & acoustic guitars, electric autoharp, electric dulcimer, backing vocals * Martin Lamble ‚Äì drums, percussion, violin, tabla & footsteps ===Additional personnel=== * Bruce Lacey & his robots on \\"Mr. Lacey\\" * Claire Lowther ‚Äì cello on \\"Book Song\\" * Kingsley Abbott ‚Äì coins on \\"The Lord Is in This Place...,\\" backing vocals on \\"Meet on the Ledge\\" * Paul Ghosh, Andrew Horvitch & Marc Ellington ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Meet on the Ledge\\" * Peter Ross ‚Äì harmonica on \\"Throwaway Street Puzzle\\" ===Production and other credits=== *Recorded at Sound Techniques, London and Olympic Studio No. 1, London (except \\"The Lord Is in This Place...\\" recorded at St. Peter's Church, Westbourne Grove, West London).

Robert \\"Farfan\\" had a sister Alice, who married William II de Percy, 3rd feudal baron of Topcliffe (d. 1174/5), and left two daughters Maud and Agnes as co-heiresses. The Ros family, from the village of Roos in Yorkshire, had in 1158 acquired the barony of Helmsley, also in Yorkshire, and before 1189 by gift of King Henry II the barony of Wark on Tweed in Northumberland. ==Career== Left fatherless, his lands were initially in the keeping of the Chief Justiciar of England, Ranulf de Glanvill. In 1191, though under age, he paid a 1000 mark fee to inherit his father's lands. In that year he also married a widow who was an illegitimate daughter of King William I of Scotland. Later he inherited from his mother one-third of the Trussebut estates, which included lands near the town of Bonneville-sur-Touques in Normandy, of which he became hereditary bailiff and castellan. In 1196, during fighting between King Richard I of England and King Philip II of France, Richard captured a French knight worth a significant ransom and put him in the castle of Bonneville. When the keeper of the castle let the knight escape, an angry Richard had the man hanged and imprisoned Ros, fining him 1200 marks (though he was later let off 275 marks). Like many magnates, he had an uneasy relationship with King John after 1199. He witnessed the King's charters, served in his armies, went on diplomatic missions for him (one in 1199 to Ros' father-in-law in Scotland), and on one occasion was reported gambling with him in Ireland. Tension arose in 1205, when John ordered his lands to be seized but later relented. It was possibly then that his younger son was taken as a hostage by the King. In 1206 he was given permission to mortgage his lands if during the next three years he went to Jerusalem, as a crusading knight or as an individual pilgrim. The permission was renewed in 1207, but his record was marred by the escape that year of another prisoner under his supervision, for which he was fined 300 marks. Back in favour in 1209, he was sent again on a diplomatic mission to Scotland but does not seem to have gone to Palestine, for in 1210 he was serving with John in Ireland. In 1212, on account of him entering a monastic order, John gave custody of his lands to Sir Philip Oldcoates. But he re-entered secular life the next year, when the King made him sheriff of Cumberland and appointed him to a commission investigating grievances in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In the latter county, he worked for a reconciliation between John and William de Forz, heir to the extensive estates there of Hawise, Countess of Aumale. In October 1213 he was one of the witnesses when John surrendered England to the authority of the Pope and he was one of the twelve guarantors appointed to ensure John kept his promises. Throughout the disturbances of 1214 and the first quarter of 1215 he remained loyal to John, being rewarded with royal manors in Cumberland and royal support for the election of his aunt as abbess of Barking Abbey. However he then joined the rebel barons as one of the 25 chosen to enforce observance of the Magna Carta agreement, being appointed by them to control Yorkshire and possibly Northumberland. For this he was excommunicated by the Pope, and John gave his lands to William de Forz. Ordered by John to give up Carlisle Castle, he did so but remained on the rebel side after the death of John in October 1216, supporting Prince Louis even after his elder son was captured by the loyalist side in May 1217. He finally submitted later that year, and regained most of his lands. Intermittent unrest in Yorkshire continued, with fighting in 1220 between his men and those of the sheriff, followed in 1221 with him being summoned to help take and destroy Skipsea Castle during the rebellion of William de Forz. In 1225 he was one of the witnesses to the reissue of Magna Carta and by the end of 1226 had re-entered a monastic order, possibly the Knights Templar. His Helmsley estates, where he had fortified the castle, then went to his elder son, while Wark, also fortified by him, went to the younger. He died that year, or in 1227, and was buried in the Temple Church in London. ==Benefactions== He was a supporter of the Knights Templar, giving them lands in Yorkshire that included Ribston, where they set up a commandery. At Bolton in Northumberland, he founded a leper hospital dedicated to St Thomas Becket, endowing it with extensive lands. He was also a benefactor of Rievaulx Abbey, Newminster Abbey, and Kirkham Priory. ==Family== Early in 1191, at Haddington near Edinburgh, he married Isabella, widow of Robert III de Brus and illegitimate daughter of King William I. Her mother was said to be a daughter of Robert Avenel. Their children included: *William (died about 1265), of Helmsley, whose wife was named Lucy, and their son was Robert (died 1285). *Robert (died about 1270), of Wark, who married Christina, daughter of William Bertram, of Mitford, and their son Robert (died about 1274) was his heir. ==References== Category:Anglo-Normans Category:Medieval English knights Category:People from Holderness Category:Magna Carta barons Category:English Christian monks Category:High Sheriffs of Cumberland Category:Norman warriors Category:1170s births Category:1226 deaths Category:13th-century English people Category:13th-century Christian monks Category:English feudal barons ","title":"Robert de Ros (died 1227)"},{"id":"1299284","text":"Sardar Patel University (SPU) is a public state university in Gujarat, India. It is named after Vallabhbhai Patel, and was founded in December 1955 by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of the then-Bombay Province and was UGC recognized under 2(f) of the UGC Act in October 1968. Originally it had the status of a rural university but now it has diversified with the motto of \\"Excellence Matters\\". ==History== The Sardar Patel University was the dream of Shri Bhaikaka. Bhaikaka was thus at the peak of his career as an engineer when he sought early retirement from Government Service in 1940 at the behest of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and joined Ahmedabad Municipality as Chief Engineer. This was the time when his mentor, Sardar Patel, began to visualise what a soon-to-be independent India would require. Patel advised Bhaikaka to give up engineering and help Patel in transforming Charotar into the focal point of India. Serving the rural countryside would control migration of people from villages to towns in search of education, employment, and healthcare. Bhaikaka resigned from this office too in 1942 at the behest of Sardar Patel, and was appointed as Chairman of Charotar education society in Anand, a few years before moving on to what we now know as the township of Vallabh Vidyanagar on 3 March 1946, but not before registering Charutar Vidya Mandal as a Charitable Education Trust on 10 August 1945. What was once a wilderness at the tri- junction of Karamsad, Bakrol, and Anand thus became Vallabh Vidyanagar, and the ‚ÄòVallabh‚Äô was prefixed to ‚ÄòVidyanagar‚Äô in recognition of Sardar's advice to work for rural uplift. Containing migration required that the reasons for migration be addressed, and Bhaikaka began to work on a plan together with Shri Bhikhabhai Patel, a dedicated and farsighted educationist, who shared Bhaikaka's vision. ==Location== Anand-Vidyanagar is on the Vadodara-Ahmedabad line of the Western Railway in the heart of the Anand District of Gujarat. It is well connected with the rest of the country by railway network and roads. It is flanked by the two major airports of Gujarat: Sardar Patel International Airport at Ahmedabad and the Vadodara Airport, Vadodara. Vidyanagar is considered as Gujarat's education hub. Vidyanagar is also known for a student friendly environment and student diversity.

He was probably the most successful comic artist in the Netherlands and had a great influence on the Dutch language by introducing new words and expressions.Marten Toonder died [Wis[s]e Words He is most famous for his series Tom Puss and Panda. ==Tom Puss/Oliver B. Bumble series== In 1931 after his final exams, Marten Toonder went to Buenos Aires with his father. Here he got acquainted with the work of the well-known Argentine artist and editor Dante Quinterno, who ran a studio producing comics. Quinterno's creations impressed him to such a degree that he decided to become an artist himself. His most famous comic series were the Tom Puss (Tom Poes in Dutch) and Oliver B. Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) series that appeared in a Dutch newspaper from 1941‚Äì86. It has a very characteristic format. Every day there were three drawings and an accompanying text (about a book-page long). It started out as a children's cartoon, but gradually became more relevant to adults. Nowadays his texts are considered literature by some critics, and Toonder received several literary prizes for them. He invented many new words and expressions and some of those are now widely used in the Dutch language. Many personalities in his comics have their own peculiar dialect of Dutch, for instance Prlwytzkofsky language of professor Prlwytzkofsky, an innovative mixture of Dutch and German. Due to this emphasis on language play, Toonder's work is difficult to translate. His drawing style is very detailed and might be compared to Pogo, with more room for background drawings, since there are no text balloons in the drawings. Apart from his eccentric use of language Toonder is also praised for satirical approach. ==Personal details== Toonder was born in Rotterdam on 2 May 1912. He lived in Ireland from 1965 until the early 1990s. He was married to the cartoon artist Phiny Dick (1912‚Äì1990), who collaborated with her husband and on whose earlier created characters Ollie B Bumble and Tom Puss were based.

Together with his brother, author , he assisted his father, (Captain) Marten Toonder Sr., a seaman born in the Dutch northern province Groningen, to write a bookKlei en zout water (Clay and salt water), Cpt. M. Toonder Sr., 1955, Unieboek N.V. Bussum, Netherlands. about his life, in which Toonder Sr. describes many details about the closing era of professional cargo sailing, the Rotterdam Lloyd (Line to East Indies), the Holland America Line, and about pre-war Rotterdam.

Unanimously, the assembly chose Hugo Le√£o to chair the meeting. As leader of the movement, he proposed the name of Paysandu Foot-Ball Club for the new club. The name was chosen as a tribute to the unfortunate event in Paysand√∫, a Uruguayan city, which would take the start of the war against Paraguay. That year, the Norte Club held a good campaign and needed to beat Guarany to force an extra match against Grupo do Remo. After the tie at 1‚Äì1, the members of the Norte Club, unreconstructed, asked the Par√°'s Foot- Ball League the cancellation of the match due to various irregularities. However, the board of the Par√°'s Foot-Ball League dismissed the appeal. The decision did not like it one bit to the members of the Norte Club, which then decided to create a movement, under the leadership of Hugo Le√£o, to the foundation of a new association, stronger, to be able to meet on equal terms their opponents. This movement did not like the members of Grupo do Remo, who tried to persuade Hugo Le√£o to abandon the idea. In February 1914, the newspaper O Estado do Par√° made the call for the meeting of a new club. The call by the newspaper had an effect, causing those who attended the meeting 42 athletes, many of whom had built the Norte Club, in addition to other different associations. Chosen the name, the assembly elected the first president, Deodoro de Mendon√ßa, who headed the board during the year 1914. It was also chosen the committee to draft the Statutes of the Club, relapsing choosing the names of Mendon√ßa Deodoro, Eurico Amanaj√°s and Arnaldo Morais. To write the status of the club assembly chose the following commission: Deodoro de Mendon√ßa, Eurico Amanaj√°s and Arnaldo Moraes. The second meeting was held on the scheduled date, February 10, 1914 at the same location of the first and with the presence of large number of participants. He was sworn in the elected board, increasing the number of members to 100 and were considered founding partners, more than 15 new members who joined the Paysandu. At the third meeting, on 19 February 1914, the Paysandu, of \\"Foot-Ball\\" went to \\"Sport Club\\". To be read to the assembly, an office requesting membership of Paysandu the Par√°'s Football League, the idea of change, which, after heated debates, put to a vote, was approved by a majority vote. And so came the Paysandu Sport Club. In 1991 and 2001, Paysandu was the champion of the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. In 2002 the club was champion of Copa Norte, and, later, champion of Copa dos Campe√µes. In 2003, Paysandu was eliminated by Boca Juniors on the second leg of a match for Copa Libertadores, after winning the first leg in La Bombonera. That was the club's first participation in the competition. In 2016, the club was champion of Copa Verde, conquering his second regional title. ==Symbols== ===Crest=== The crest is blue and white, with the PSC initials, in reference to the name Paysandu Sport Club. At the bottom, there is a winged foot (with wings), creating M√°rio Bayma who explained its meaning: \\"The team speed goal would never be equaled or surpassed by his opponents, because come the flight limits.\\" Above the shield is three stars, two silver symbolizing the title of Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B of 1991 (left) and 2001 (right), and a gold (central) symbolizing the title of Copa dos Campe√µes in 2002. ===Anthem=== The official anthem of Paysandu was composed in 1916 by the poet Jos√© Sim√µes, while the music was made by Professor Manuel Lu√≠s de Paiva. There is also the \\"popular\\" hymn, composed by Francisco Pires Cavalcanti, excited about the victory of Paysandu against Pe√±arol in 1965, which is better known than the official team anthem. ===Traditional home kit=== The uniform was proposed by Hugo Le√£o, first president of Paysandu, at the meeting held on February 10, 1914. The proposal was not approved by the General Assembly, by unanimous vote of the members, on February 19, 1914, seventeen days later the foundation of the club. The uniform follows the same model to the present day. ==Rivalries== Paysandu rivals are Remo and Tuna Luso. The biggest rival is Remo. ==Stadium== Paysandu's stadium is Curuz√∫, which has a maximum capacity of 16,200 people. Mangueir√£o also held several Paysandu matches. ==Current squad== ==Honours== * Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B : Winners (2): 1991, 2001 * Copa dos Campe√µes : Winners (1): 2002 * Copa Verde : Winners (2): 2016, 2018 * Copa Norte : Winners (1): 2002 * Campeonato Paraense : Winners (48): 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2020 ==External links== *Official Site *Pap√£o.Net *Na√ß√£o Bicolor Category:Association football clubs established in 1914 Category:Football clubs in Par√° Category:Bel√©m Category:1914 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Paysandu Sport Club"},{"id":"1299302","text":"BBC Japan was a television channel from the BBC available via satellite in Japan.

The Huaca del Sol is an adobe brick temple built by the Moche civilization (100 CE to 800 CE) on the northern coast of what is now Peru. The temple is one of several ruins found near the volcanic peak of Cerro Blanco, in the coastal desert near Trujillo at the Moche Valley. The other major ruin at the site is the nearby Huaca de la Luna, a better-preserved but smaller temple. By 450 CE, eight different stages of construction had been completed on the Huaca del Sol. The technique was additive; new layers of brick were laid directly on top of the old, hence large quantities of bricks were required for the construction. Archeologists have estimated that the Huaca del Sol was composed of over 130 million adobe bricks and was the largest pre-Columbian adobe structure built in the Americas. The number of different makers' marks on the bricks suggests that over a hundred different communities contributed bricks to the construction of the Huacas. The Huaca del Sol was composed of four main levels. The structure was expanded and rebuilt by different rulers over the course of time. It is believed to have originally been about 50 meters in height and 340m. by 160 m. at the base. Located at the center of the Moche capital city, the temple appears to have been used for ritual, ceremonial activities and as a royal residence and burial chambers. Archaeological evidence attests to these functions. During the Spanish occupation of Peru in the early 17th century, colonists redirected the waters of the Moche River to run past the base of the Huaca del Sol in order to facilitate the looting of gold artifacts from the temple. The operation of the hydraulic mine greatly damaged the Huaca del Sol. In total, approximately two-thirds of the structure has been lost to erosion and such looting. The remaining structure stands at a height of 41 meters (135 feet). Looting and erosion due to El Ni√±o continue to be major concerns to this day. ==See also== * Huaca de la Luna * History of Peru * Pre-Inca cultures ==References== # Art of the Andes, from Chavin to Inca.

XXI.) of a good family, but there is no record of his upbringing and education. He probably began to practise as an apothecary as a youth; and owned the then famous Farmacia del Moro near the Cathedral. In 1540 he was among the founders of the Accademia degli Umidi, which was soon renamed Accademia Fiorentina. He later took a leading role in the establishment of the more famous Accademia della Crusca, which published his Vocabulario of words accepted as the purest Italian. To both societies he was known as Il Lasca or Leuciscus, a pseudonym which is still frequently substituted for his proper name. Grazzini was temperamental, his life consequently enlivened or disturbed by various literary quarrels. His Umidi brethren expelled him for a time, because of his ruthless criticism of the Arameans, a party of academicians who maintained that the Florentine language was derived from Hebrew, Aramaic, or some other branch of the Semitic. He was readmitted in 1566, when his friend Salviati was consul. II Lasca ranks as one of the great masters of Tuscan prose. His style is flexible and abundantly idiomatic, but without affectation. It has the force and freshness of popular speech, whilst retaining a flavour of academic culture. ==Main works== *Le Cene (1549), a collection of stories in the manner of Boccaccio, and a number of prose comedies.

In 1868 Adamo Rossi published in his Ricerche per le biblioteche di Perugia three novelle by Grazzini, from a manuscript of the 16th century in the Comunale of Perugia; and in 1870 a small collection of those poems which have been left unpublished by previous editors appeared at Poggibonsi, Alcune poesie inedite. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1503 births Category:1584 deaths Category:People from Florence Category:Italian male writers ","title":"Antonio Francesco Grazzini"},{"id":"1299307","text":"The Lu≈ænice (; ) is a river in the Czech Republic (204 km) starting in Austria (4 km).

He is credited for beginning what is now known as \\"Bernesque poetry\\", a serio- comedic type of poetry with elements of satire. ==Biography== ===Life=== Berni was born 1497 or 1498 in Lamporecchio (Tuscany). His father Nicol√≤ was a doctor of a long-established Florentine, but excessively poor. At an early age he was sent to Florence, where he remained until his nineteenth year and wrote a pastoral play, Catrina. In 1517 he set out for Rome, in the service of Bernardo Dovizi, Cardinal Bibbiena. After the cardinal's death (1520), he was thrown on his own devices. At the time of the election of Adrian VI he circulated witty lampoons, for which he was obliged for a time to leave Rome. Later he returned to accept a situation as clerk or secretary to Gian Matteo Giberti, datary to Clement VII. The duties of his office, for which Berni was in every way unfit, were exceedingly irksome to the poet, who, however, made himself celebrated at Rome as the most witty and inventive of a certain club of literary men, who devoted themselves to light and sparkling effusions. So strong was the admiration for Berni's verses, that mocking or burlesque poems have since been called poesie bernesche. About the year 1530 he was relieved from his servitude by obtaining a canonry in the cathedral of Florence. In that city he died in 1536, according to Romantic tradition poisoned by Duke Alessandro de Medici, for having refused to poison the duke's cousin, Ippolito de' Medici; but considerable obscurity rests over this story. ===Works=== Berni stands at the head of Italian comic or burlesque poets. For lightness, sparkling wit, variety of form and fluent diction, his verses are unsurpassed. Perhaps, however, he owes his greatest fame to the recasting (Rifacimento) of Boiardo's Orlando innamorato. The enormous success of Ariosto's Orlando furioso had directed fresh attention to the older poem, from which it took its characters, and of which it is the continuation. But Boiardo's work, though good in plan, could never have achieved wide popularity on account of the extreme ruggedness of its style. Berni undertook the revision of the whole poem, avowedly altering no sentiment, removing or adding no incident, but simply giving to each line and stanza due gracefulness and polish. His task he completed with marvellous success; scarcely a line remains as it was, and the general opinion has pronounced decisively in favour of the revision over the original. To each canto he prefixed a few stanzas of reflective verse in the manner of Ariosto, and in one of these introductions he gives us the only certain information we have concerning his own life. Berni appears to have been favorably disposed towards the Reformation principles at that time introduced into Italy, and this may explain the bitterness of some remarks of his upon the church. The first edition of the Rifacimento was printed posthumously in 1541, and it has been supposed that a few passages either did not receive the author's final revision, or have been retouched by another hand. The success of Berni's Rifacimento was so great that the original text by Boiardo fell into oblivion for three centuries. Only in the nineteenth century did Anthony Panizzi discover in the British Museum Library the authentic Orlando Innamorato and publish it. A partial translation of Berni's Orlando was published by W.S. Rose in 1823. ==Legacy== Streets in Florence, Empoli, Pietrasanta, Varese and Verona have been named via Francesco Berni after him. ==References== ;Attribution * ==External links== * * *Berni's Rifacimento of Orlando Innamorato (English translation) *Gian Matteo Giberti, Biographical note Category:1490s births Category:1536 deaths Category:Italian poets Category:Italian male poets Category:Italian Renaissance writers Category:Sonneteers Category:People from the Province of Arezzo ","title":"Francesco Berni"},{"id":"1299337","text":"Volume is the quantity of space an object occupies in a 3D space.

He created heroic sculpture for international expositions and war memorials, but also was noted for his small bronzes and portrait busts. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Academy of Design, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and other museums. He held the position of Instructor of Sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for 37 years. His students included Paul Manship, Albin Polasek, and Walker Hancock. ==Education== Grafly was born in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of the 8 children of Charles and Elizabeth (Simmons) Grafly. His family were Quaker farmers, and of German and Dutch heritage. He attended Philadelphia public schools, and developed an interest in art at an early age. At 17 he apprenticed himself to John Struthers & Sons Marble Works, at that time one of the largest stone carving ventures in the country. He spent four years carving ornament and figures for Philadelphia City Hall, under the direction of sculptor Alexander Milne Calder.James-Gadzinski and Cunningham. To improve his understanding of anatomy and his skill at carving figures, he began attending night classes at the Spring Garden Institute.Charles Grafly Collection, from Winterthur Library. He studied under Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts beginning in 1884, and followed Eakins to the Art Students' League of Philadelphia in 1886. He returned to PAFA the following year, and studied under Thomas Anshutz. Grafly moved to Paris in 1888, where he studied for a year at the Acad√©mie Julian--drawing under Tony Robert-Fleury, painting under William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and sculpture under Henri Chapu. He shared a flat with fellow American art students Robert Henri, Harry Finney, William Hoefeker, and James Randolph Fisher.William Yarrow and Louis Bouche, Robert Henri, His Life and Works (New York: Boni & Liveright, 1921), p. 18. In 1889 he gained admittance to the √âcole des Beaux Arts, but only stayed one year. He exhibited two ideal busts, Saint John and Daedalus at the Paris Salon of 1890. He exhibited his first major work, a life-size female nude, Mauvais Presage, at the Salon of 1891, which received an Honorable Mention. It is now at the Detroit Institute of Arts. ==Career== The Vulture of War fragment (1895-96), on exhibit at PAFA in 1898. The death of his father brought Grafly back to Philadelphia in early 1892, and he began teaching at the Drexel Institute and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.James Terry White, \\"Charles Grafly\\" The National Cyclopedia of American Biography (New York: James T. White & Company, 1904), p. 547. PAFA created the position of \\"Instructor of Sculpture\\" for Grafly, and under him the sculpture department was put \\"on an equal footing with painting for the first time\\". He took a one-year sabbatical in 1895, to get married and create what he hoped would be his masterpiece. In Paris, he began work on The Vulture of War, a nightmarish sculpture group depicting carnage and death. It quickly evolved from a two-figure work to a three-figure work, and ultimately a four-figure work. These consisted of the colossal figure of War; who wields the uncomprehending Man as a weapon (swings him like a scythe); a lifeless woman (Death and Destruction); and the sinister figure of Plunder, who holds the globe under his foot. Sculptor Jean Dampt provided Grafly with weekly critiques as the work progressed. Of the four figures, only the plunderer was completed by the end of his sabbatical. Grafly returned to teaching at PAFA in Fall 1896, but continued to work on the sculpture group. A heroic-sized plaster of the plunderer was exhibited at PAFA's 1898 annual exhibition, and was part of Grafly's gold medal-winning exhibit at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. The plaster was also part of Grafly's exhibit at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, but he abandoned it there rather than paying the freight fees to ship it back to Philadelphia. Grafly was commissioned in 1898 to create two colossal busts for the Smith Memorial Arch, a Civil War monument in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. Following sculptor William Ordway Partridge's withdrawal, Grafly also created the memorial's 15-foot (4.6 m) statue of General John F. Reynolds.Major General John Fulton Reynolds, from SIRIS. ===Expositions=== ====Fountain of Man==== Grafly was commissioned to create a fountain for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, with architect Charles Dudley Arnold. The Fountain of Man was crowned by an eerie half-hooded central figure, Man, the Mysterious, with faces on the front and back of his head representing the two natures of Man. Supporting the fountain's upper basin were nude figures representing the 5 senses, and supporting the lower basin were four pairs of crouching male and female atlantes, each couple representing contrasting emotions-- love and hate, ambition and despair, etc.Vittoria C. Dallin, \\"Charles Grafly's Work\\", New England Magazine, vol. 25, no. 2 (October 1901), pp. 228-35.

The Pioneer Mother Monument Association raised $22,500 for the project, and in 1913 Trask commissioned Grafly to create the sculpture. Grafly's plaster sketches are preserved at Wichita State University's Ulrich Museum of Art, and an early iteration of the work is almost comical--a stalwart mother balancing screaming twin infants, one on each arm.Pioneer Mother, from Ulrich Museum of Art. Grafly's final model went in another direction, granting the woman and her two naked toddlers a simple dignity. The casting took longer than expected, and the sculpture was not in place for the exhibition's March 2, 1915 opening. Set on a 26-foot (7.9 m) stepped concrete base, the monument was dedicated on June 30, 1915. > The Pioneer Mother monument, by Charles Grafly, is a permanent bronze, a > tribute by the people of the West to the women who laid the foundation of > their welfare.

S. Perry, The Sculpture and Mural Decorations of the > Exposition (San Francisco: Paul Elder and Company Publishers, 1915). The relocation of the monument to the city's Civic Center never happened, and the sculpture was rediscovered during the Great Depression, weather-beaten and vandalized, amidst the ruins of the 1915 world's fair. Civic and historical groups, notably the Native Daughters of the Golden West,Warren & Georgia Radford, Outdoor Sculpture in San Francisco: A Heritage of Public Art, Helsham Press, Gualala, CA, 2002, p. 54. raised money to restore the sculpture for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition.Pioneer Mother Memorial in Golden Gate Park, from San Francisco Recreation & Parks. After the exposition, it was installed in Golden Gate Park and rededicated on December 8, 1940. ====Works exhibited==== *1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois - portrait bust of Daedalus (bronze), A Bad Omen (plaster).

Viereck (1909), PAFA. Grafly modeled dozens of portrait heads and busts; many as commissions, but also of friends and family members. In 1898, he modeled a bust of Hugh H. Breckenridge, the first in what became a three-decade series of busts of fellow artists.Helen W. Henderson, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and Other Collection of Philadelphia (Boston: 1911), pp. 206-07. The sitter sometimes painted a portrait of Grafly in exchange. Lorado Taft claimed \\"there is no sculptor in this country who can make a finer bust\\". Critic Helen W. Henderson wrote: > The bust of Henry Lorenz Viereck, entomologist, is the unique work of > Charles Grafly in Washington. [D.C.] It is owned by the sitter. This bust, > made about 1908, is one of the most successful of that series of portrait > busts commenced by the sculptor a few years ago, and including at the > present time, many distinguished artists, doctors, and specialists in other > fields.

Henderson, The Art > Treasures of Washington (Boston: L. C. Page & Company, 1912), pp. 383-84. In the 1920s, Grafly created four busts of historical figures for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, in Bronx, New York City.James Buchanan Eads from Hall of Fame for Great Americans.Jonathan Edwards from Hall of Fame for Great Americans.David Glasgow Farragut from Hall of Fame for Great Americans.John Paul Jones from Hall of Fame for Great Americans. ====New York Custom House==== Grafly modeled two of the colossal figures for the fa√ßade of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, New York City. His allegorical figure of England (1903‚Äì07) depicts a young Queen Victoria dressed in armor, holding the wand of Hermes and accompanied by the shield of St. George and a ship's wheel. His allegorical figure of France (1904‚Äì07) depicts a goddess crowned with a laurel wreath, holding a sceptre, a sheaf of wheat and a bronze statuette representing the Fine Arts, and accompanied by a Gallic rooster and the ancient god Dusios. Both figures were carved in limestone by the Piccirilli Brothers.Inventory of American Sculpture, June 1998, National Museum of American Art/Smithsonian Institution, Record ID: IAS 77003068. ====Meade Memorial==== General George Gordon Meade Memorial (1915-27), Washington, D.C. The most prestigious commission of Grafly's career was the Major General George Gordon Meade Memorial (1915‚Äì27), a monument for the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\\"Grafly, Charles (1862-1929)\\", The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists (Oxford University Press, 2007). General Meade (1815-1872) had been commander of the decisive Union victory at Gettysburg, and the memorial was the gift of Pennsylvania to the nation. It was originally installed south of Pennsylvania Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Streets NWMeade Memorial, from SIRIS.--a site now mostly covered by the Capitol Reflecting Pool.Capitol Reflecting Pool, from Architect of the Capitol. This was opposite and slightly north of the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial. On January 21, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed a joint resolution of Congress creating the federal commission for the Meade Memorial. On November 23, 1915, the commission chose Grafly as the sculptor and Simon & Bassett (later Simon & Simon) as the architects for the project.The Memorial to Major General George Gordon Meade in Washington, D.C. (The Meade Memorial Commission of Pennsylvania, October 1927). Grafly's sculpture program went through several iterations before it was granted preliminary approval by the D.C. Commission of Fine Arts, three years later. His design mixed the literal, the allegorical and the fantastical, and was granted final approval in January 1922. Preliminary model for the Meade Memorial (1915-25). The memorial features eight figures grouped in a circle.Kathryn Allamong Jacob, Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, Part 3 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998), pp. 54-59. The primary figure of General Meade, dressed in his Civil War uniform, faces south. He is flanked by six nude allegorical figures - Loyalty, Fame and Energy on the west side; Chivalry, Progress and Military Courage on the east side - representing qualities that Grafly \\"believed were necessary for the character of a great general\\". Facing north is the dark angel of War, \\"unchanged since war first ravaged the world\\". He wears a helmet, breastplate and cape, and before him stands a knightly sword, ready to be taken up when necessary. \\"War... holds in his grim clutch two memorial tablets [on which are listed Meade's military battles]. His wings, in long sweeping curves, stretch toward the standard which Loyalty holds... The side groups are thus outlined against the ominous shadow of the wings of War.\\" Loyalty and Chivalry remove General Meade's \\"cloak of battle\\". \\"Loyalty also raises aloft over Meade's head a standard [ (Legion eagle) ] of wreaths and garlands, in commemoration of great achievement.\\" The Piccirilli Brothers carved the figures from white Tennessee marble. The cylindrical base is gray granite, and the stepped circular platform is Milford pink granite. The memorial was dedicated on October 19, 1927. The Meade Memorial was dismantled in 1969, to make way for excavation of the 3rd Street Tunnel under the National Mall and construction of the Capitol Reflecting Pool. Following fourteen years in storage, the memorial was restored, and reinstalled on the entrance plaza of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in 1983, one block northwest of its original site. ====Pennypacker Memorial==== Major General Galusha Pennypacker (1921-34), Philadelphia, completed by Albert Laessle Grafly was commissioned to create a memorial to Major General Galusha Pennypacker for Logan Square, Philadelphia. A courageous Civil War soldier, Pennypacker had been promoted to general at age 22.Major General Galusha Pennypacker, from SIRIS. Grafly's concept was to depict him in the prime of his manhood--as a burly, bare-chested Roman general, flanked by tigers and straddling a chariot-like cannon. Grafly invited his former student Albert Laessle to model the tigers, and worked on the project, 1921‚Äì26, before setting it aside to concentrate on the Meade Memorial. In 1934, five years after Grafly's death, Laessle completed the Pennypacker Memorial based on his designs. ===Other honors=== The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts awarded Grafly its 1899 Converse Gold Medal of Honor \\"for distinguished services to art and to the Academy\\". The National Sculpture Society awarded him its 1905 J. Q. A. Ward Prize.Brush and Pencil, vol. 16, no. 5 (November 1905), p. 143. At its 1913 annual exhibition, PAFA awarded him the first Widener Gold Medal for Sculpture for his portrait bust of Thomas Anshutz.Peter Hastings Falk, ed., The Annual Exhibition Record of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Volume 2, 1876 - 1913 (Madison, CT: Soundview Press, 1989). The Philadelphia Water Color Club awarded him its 1916 Lea First Prize (for drawing).Memorial Exhibition of Work by Charles Grafly (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1930), p. 7. The National Academy of Design awarded him its 1919 Watrous Gold Medal, for his portrait bust of Childe Hassam. The Chicago Art Institute awarded him its 1921 Potter Palmer Gold Medal\\"Prize Work at American Art Exhibit\\", The Monumental News, vol. 34, no. 2 (February 1922), p. 98. and the Concord Art Association awarded him its 1922 Medal of Honor, both for his portrait bust of Frank Duveneck.\\"Concord, Mass.\\" American Art News, May 20, 1922, p. 4. Grafly was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society (1893), served on its council, and was later elected a Fellow.Historic Members, from National Sculpture Society. He was elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1902, and an academician in 1905.David B. Dearinger, Paintings and Sculpture at the National Academy of Design, Volume 1, 1826-1925 (Hudson Hills Publishing, 2004), pp. 230-31. (Robert Henri painted Grafly's NAD diploma portrait.) He was a member of the Philadelphia Art Club, the Architectural League of New York, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and other arts organizations. ==Personal== Grafly married Frances Sekeles of Corinth, Mississippi, on June 7, 1895. They had one daughter, Dorothy (1896-1980), born in Paris during his sabbatical from PAFA. The Graflys lived at 2140 N. 12th Street, Philadelphia, and he had a studio at 2200 Arch Street. Except for his sabbatical in 1895‚Äì96, Grafly taught at PAFA from 1892 to his death in 1929. Among his students were sculptors Eugene Castello, Nancy Coonsman, George Demetrios, Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, Walker Hancock, Charles Harley, Albert Laessle, Paul Manship, Eleanor Mary Mellon, Louis Milione, Albin Polasek, Dudley Pratt, Lawrence Tenney Stevens, and Katherine Lane Weems. In 1905, Grafly bought property in Lanesville, Gloucester, Massachusetts, and built a house and studio that he named \\"Fool's Paradise\\". Favored PAFA students were invited to visit and use his studio. Following the 1917 death of sculptor Bela Pratt, Grafly taught (additionally) at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He made \\"Fool's Paradise\\" his residence year-round, and commuted to Philadelphia or Boston by train.Anna Seaton-Schmidt, \\"Charles Grafly in His Summer Home\\", The American Magazine of Art, no. 10 (December 1918). Grafly's prot√©g√©, Walker Hancock, considered him \\"the pre-eminent instructor of sculpture in this country\\", and came to PAFA in 1920 specifically to study under him. Hancock won awards for his work as a student, two traveling scholarships and, after graduation, the 1925 Prix de Rome in sculpture. In April 1929, on the day he returned to Philadelphia from the American Academy in Rome, Hancock heard the news--Grafly had been struck by a hit-and-run driver the night before. > During the ensuing days, even though he was gradually failing, we had the > opportunity to talk about things that concerned him. Two things were very > much on his mind. He asked me to make sure that the wreath behind the head > of General Meade in the Meade Memorial in Washington would be freshly > gilded. His other worry was that the landscaping around his statue of James > Buchanan in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, had not been carried out. He wanted me > to see that this was done. > In the period of his hospitalization and suffering, Grafly told Mr. [John > Andrew] Myers [Director of PAFA] that he wanted me to take his place as > instructor of sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy. He lived only two weeks > after the accident. Hancock was among those who eulogized Grafly at his memorial service.Walker Hancock, A Sculptor's Fortunes (Gloucester, MA: Cape Ann Historical Association, 1997). The pall bearers at his funeral included former students Albert Laessle and Albin Polasek; and artists Hugh Breckenridge, Edward Redfield, Robert Henri and Albert Rosenthal. Dorothy Grafly became an art critic and author. Her 1929 biography of her father, The Sculptor's Clay: Charles Grafly (1862‚Äì1929), was reissued by Wichita State University in 1996.Dorothy Grafly Drummond, The Sculptor's Clay: Charles Grafly (1862‚Äì1929) (Edwin A. Ulrich Museum of Art, 1996). ==Legacy== The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts's collection includes about twenty of Grafly's bronzes. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University possesses more than two hundred of his works, mostly plaster casts, a bequest of Dorothy Grafly Drummond (the artist's daughter). ==Selected works== *Aeneas and Anchises (1893), Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington, Delaware.Aeneas and Anchises, from SIRIS.

He is a member of the Assembly of the Republic and was also a candidate in the 2006 presidential election. ==Early life and leftist activity== Born in , Loures, Lisbon District, Jer√≥nimo de Sousa was born into a humble working-class family, dominated by the right-leaning regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. At the age of 14, he followed the path of most of the children of the working-class families growing up in the industrial belt of Lisbon. He became a machine tuner in a siderurgy near his hometown. He started his anti-fascist activities soon after, while integrating the cultural working class associations of his hometown in the 1960s. In that period he made contact with the strong clandestine organization that the Portuguese Communist Party had in the suburbs of Lisbon, where he, being one of the few able to read, used to read the illegal communist newspaper Avante!, in secrecy, for the other workers. He would later formalize his membership, right after the Carnation Revolution, in 1974. From 1969 to 1971 Jer√≥nimo de Sousa participated in the Colonial War against the liberation movements that were struggling in the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He served in Guinea-Bissau, forced to fight the Marxist movement of liberation, the PAIGC. After the replacement of Salazar by Marcello Caetano in 1969, the regime made some slight democratic openings, one of them was the possibility of workers without any record of illegal political activity participate in the elections for the respective Unions. In 1973 he participated in the election for the leadership of the Lisbon Metallurgical Workers' Union, dominated by the collaborationists of the regime, a characteristic of the corporativist regime of Salazar. Being free of any political suspicion and after being chosen among the MEC workers to integrate the list to the Lisbon Union, he was able to participate in the election and his list, influenced in secrecy by the communists, won it. From April 1974 he was elected to the workers commission of MEC, a role he kept until 1995. ==Activity after the Carnation Revolution of 1974== In the first democratic election after 48 years of country's history, that was meant to elect a parliament that would write a new democratic constitution, Jer√≥nimo de Sousa was elected as MP. Entering the Assembly of the Republic for the first time, a curious thing happened: a worker at the Assembly called him \\"doctor\\", he answered he was not a doctor and the worker replied: \\"sorry engineer\\", expressing the weirdness associated with the presence of a factory worker in a chamber that was dominated for 48 years by the top figures of the regime. He continued to be elected in the subsequent legislative elections, and only left parliament in 1993. In 2002, he returned after the legislative election of that year. Meanwhile, Jer√≥nimo was elected for the first time to the Central Committee of the PCP in 1979 and became a member of its Political Bureau in 1992. He was the Party's candidate for the 1996 presidential election, but he left the race giving his support to the Socialist candidate, Jorge Sampaio. In 2004, after the Party's 17th Congress, in November, Jer√≥nimo de Sousa was elected General Secretary, replacing Carlos Carvalhas.

Meyers. It was produced by his Fountain Valley, California company, B. F. Meyers & Co. from 1964 to 1971, in the form of car kits applied to shortened chassis of Volkswagen Beetles. The car line dominated dune racing in its time, breaking records immediately, and was eventually also released in street-oriented models, until the company's demise due to tax problems after Meyers's departure. New vehicles inspired by the original Manx buggy have been produced by Meyers's re-founded operation, Meyers Manx, Inc., since 2000. The name and cat logo of the brand derives from the Manx cat, by virtue of the tailless breed's and the shortened vehicle's truncated \\"stubbiness\\". ==Home-made prototype== Drawing on his experience in sailboat construction, Meyers modeled and built his first dune buggy, \\"Old Red\\", a shortened VW Beetle with a monocoque, fiberglass shell and Chevrolet pickup truck (trailing arm style) suspension, in late 1963 to May 1964 in his garage in Newport Beach, California. The first known street-legal fiberglass dune buggy, it featured a unibody shell that fused body, fenders and frame, retaining just the engine, transmission and other mechanicals of the VW, and with no top and no hood. The use of compound curves throughout provided great rigidity. The fenders were arched high, to make room for large, knobby dirt- racing wheels. The \\"Manx\\" name for the shortened, taller-wheeled, more maneuverable VW Beetle mods refers to and derives from the comparably stubby Manx cat breed, colloquially called \\"stubbins\\"; they are short-spined and stub-tailed-to-tailless, long-legged, and known for their turning ability while chasing. The Meyers Manx logo prominently features a Manx cat. The tailless cat in the logo, as featured on the hood ornament, is stylized after a passant heraldic lion, its right forepaw brandishing a sword. The name also suggests racing fitness, as the already globally renowned, British- manufactured Norton Manx motorcycle dominated the Isle of Man TT, Manx Grand Prix and other Isle of Man-based (i.e. Manx) international races from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The Meyers Manx has no direct connection to the Isle of Man. Meyers produced kits later in 1964 and into 1965, marketed under the name Meyers Manx. Although this early design was critically acclaimed, even featured on the April 1967 cover of Car & Driver magazine, and drew much attention, it proved too expensive to be profitable; ultimately only 12 kits of the monocoque Manx were produced. Meyers and a friend (both amateur racers) broke by over four hours the Ensenada - La Paz run's record of 39 hours, until then held by a pro racer. According to James Hale, compiler of the Dune Buggy Handbook, this feat ushered in an era of Meyers Manx \\"domination in off-road events ... and the formation of NORRA (National Off-Road Racing Association)\\". ==B. F. Meyers & Co. models== The commercially manufactured Meyers Manx Mk I featured an open-wheeled fiberglass bodyshell, coupled with the Volkswagen Beetle H4 flat-four engine (1.2 L, 1.3 L, 1.5 L and 1.6 L, in different models) and a modified, RR-layout Beetle frame. It is a small car, with a wheelbase 14¬º inches (36.2 cm) shorter than a Beetle automobile for lightness and better maneuverability. For this reason, the car is capable of very quick acceleration and good off-road performance, despite not being four-wheel drive. The usually street-legal car redefined and filled a recreational and competitive niche that had been essentially invented by the first civilian Jeep in 1945, and which was later to be overtaken by straddle-ridden, motorcycle-based all-terrain vehicles (introduced in 1970) and newer, small and sporty (but usually four-wheel-drive), off-road automobiles. The commercial Meyers Manx received widespread recognition when it defeated motorcycles, trucks and other cars to win the inaugural 1967 Mexican 1000 race (the predecessor of the Baja 1000). It crossed automotive press genre lines, being selected as the cover story in the August 1966 issue of Hot Rod magazine. Approximately 6,000 of the original Meyers Manx dune buggies were produced, but when the design became popular many copies (estimated at a quarter of a million worldwide) were made by other companies. Although already patented, Meyers & Co. lost in court to the copiers, the judge rescinding his patent as unpatentable, opening the floodgates to the industry Meyers started. Since then, numerous vehicles of the general \\"dune buggy\\" or \\"beach buggy\\" body type, some VW-based, others not, have been and continue to be produced. An early example was the Imp by EMPI (1968-1970), which borrowed stylistic elements from the Chevrolet Corvette but was otherwise Manx-like. A later 1970s Manx clone was the Dune Runner from Dune Buggy Enterprises in Westminster, California. The Meyers company attempted to stay ahead of this seemingly unfair competition with the release of the distinctive, and harder- to-copy, Meyers Manx Mk II design. B. F. Meyers & Co. also produced other Beetle-based vehicles, including the May 1970 Car & Driver magazine cover sporty Manx SR variant (street roadsters, borrowing some design ideas from the Porsche 914), the Meyers Tow'd (sometimes referred to as the \\"Manx Tow'd\\", a non-street-legal racing vehicle designed to be towed to the desert or beach), the Meyers Tow'dster (a street-legal hybrid of the two,), and Meyers Resorter a.k.a. Meyers Turista (a small recreational or \\"resort\\" vehicle inspired by touring motorcycles). The Manx SR2 was a modified SR that was only produced by later manufacturers including Karma Coachworks, Heartland Motors and Manx Motors of MD. While the Tow'd was a minimal off-road racer and the SR/SR2 was a showy roadster, the Tow'dster was a compromise between a dune-capable vehicle and a more utilitarian street rod, and \\"paved the way for the rail- type buggy that was to dominate the buggy scene following the demise of the traditional Manx-type buggy.\\" The company ceased operation in 1971, after financial troubles, including with the Internal Revenue Service; and Bruce Meyers himself had already left his own company by then. ==Meyers Manx, Inc. models== In 2000, Bruce Meyers created a resurgence of interest by founding Meyers Manx, Inc., based in Valley Center, California, and offering the Classic Manx series, a limited edition of 100. In 2002, the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter DualSport were born. These two new models are modernizations of the original design, but are sized for a full-length Beetle floor pan (and the DualSport can also be based on a Super Beetle chassis, unlike any other Manx model). Custom versions for higher-power engines and other variations are also available. In the spring of 2009, Meyers re-introduced the shortened wheelbase. Named the Manx after the last action a surfer performs before reaching the shore, it is available in two models. The Kick-Out Manx Traditional is an updated version of the original Manx concept, with wider fenders, plus a front-hinged hood providing extra storage and easier access to electricals. The Kick-Out Manx (a.k.a. Kick-Out S.S. Manx) version is much more modern, with headlights flared into the hood, curved windshield, sculpted rear deck cover and twin roll hoops. , no Meyers Manx kits are based on the New Beetle or other modern Volkswagen cars, only particular original Beetle and Super Beetle models, which are rear-engine and rear-wheel-drive. No Meyers Manx kits are based on front-engine, front-wheel-drive platforms. Aftermarket frames are available, designed to duplicate VW chassis dimensions but provide improvements such as more modern or more rugged components. ==In popular culture== Manx-type cars have appeared in several movies, including Elvis Presley films and the 1968 The Thomas Crown Affair, which contains a lengthy beach-driving scene in which actor Steve McQueen drives an extensively- modified Meyers Manx, visibly equipped with a Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine from a Chevrolet Corvair, on beaches and over dunes. Speed Buggy, a 1973 cartoon show that ran for 16 episodes featured a sentient & speaking dune buggy (based on the Meyers Manx) voiced by Mel Blanc. https://www.msn.com/en- us/autos/enthusiasts/imagination-station-15-unreal-cars-that-should-be- real/ar-AAdfXHI#page=8 The Manx-style dune buggy was introduced to a younger generation in the late 1970s, in the form of \\"Wonderbug\\", a segment of the first two seasons (1976-1978) of the American Sunday-morning children's television program The Krofft Supershow on the ABC network. The series of live-action episodic shorts centered on a sentient car named Schlepcar, made up of rusty old dune buggy and Jeep parts, who could magically transform into the superhero Wonderbug, a fancy, talking Manx-like dune buggy with movable dual front bumpers for a mouth and movable headlights for eyes. The actual car used for Wonderbug was a Dune Runner knock-off, not a genuine Meyers Manx. The Barbie doll accessory collection long featured a pink and white Manx-like dune buggy toy. Matchbox toy cars come in several Manx-inspired dune buggy models (e.g. the #47b Beach Hopper in 1974, up to the #59 Baja Bandit and its variants still released as recently as 2011). Playmates produced a Manx- inspired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figure vehicle called \\"Mike's Kowabunga Surf Buggy\\". The Meyers Manx was featured in Sega's arcade game OutRunners as \\"Wild Chaser\\". In the Grand Theft Auto video game series, a vehicle resembling the Meyers Manx and named the \\"BF Injection\\" is a rear engine dune-buggy, first featured in Grand Theft Auto III, and seen again in Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories as a hidden vehicle. An updated version appears in Grand Theft Auto V called the \\"BF Bifta\\", while the name \\"Injection\\" is given to another vehicle highly resembling the Baja Bug, and the \\"BF\\" marque is used for buggies and other cars based on VW models. The music video for the Gorillaz song \\"19-2000\\" features the band driving an animated, customized Manx throughout the video. It is referred to by band member Murdoc Niccals as the \\"Geep\\" (referencing Jeep), and is most notably customized with a camouflage paint job, a turbocharger and side-mounted, lock- on capable missile launchers that are normally stored in the undercarriage. The Meyers Manx appears in the Microsoft Studios racing video game Forza Horizon 3 (2016). The vehicle also appears in later entries in the Forza game series, including Forza Motorsport 7 (2017) and Forza Horizon 4 (2018). ==See also== *Baja Bug *Cal looker *Cal-Style VW *Formula Vee *Volksrod ==References== * Meyers Manx FourWheeler.com documentary ==External links== * MeyersManx.com - the modern manufacturer's official website * \\"Meyers Manx (Monocoque)\\" entry in Dune Buggy Handbook, with detailed technical specs, timeline, and photos Category:Kit cars Category:Off-road vehicles Category:Volkswagen Beetle modifications Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers based in California Category:Cars powered by boxer engines Category:Rear- engined vehicles ","title":"Meyers Manx"},{"id":"1299403","text":"Bal√£o M√°gico (\\"Magic Balloon\\") was a children's television program in Brazil.

Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression. Features are usually numeric, but structural features such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern recognition. The concept of \\"feature\\" is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression. ==Classification== A set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a feature vector. One of the ways of achieving binary classification is using a linear predictor function (related to the perceptron) with a feature vector as input. The method consists of calculating the scalar product between the feature vector and a vector of weights, comparing the result with a threshold, and deciding the class based on the comparison. Algorithms for classification from a feature vector include nearest neighbor classification, neural networks, and statistical techniques such as Bayesian approaches. ==Examples== In character recognition, features may include histograms counting the number of black pixels along horizontal and vertical directions, number of internal holes, stroke detection and many others. In speech recognition, features for recognizing phonemes can include noise ratios, length of sounds, relative power, filter matches and many others. In spam detection algorithms, features may include the presence or absence of certain email headers, the email structure, the language, the frequency of specific terms, the grammatical correctness of the text. In computer vision, there are a large number of possible features, such as edges and objects. ==Extensions== In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. Many algorithms in machine learning require a numerical representation of objects, since such representations facilitate processing and statistical analysis. When representing images, the feature values might correspond to the pixels of an image, while when representing texts the features might be the frequencies of occurrence of textual terms. Feature vectors are equivalent to the vectors of explanatory variables used in statistical procedures such as linear regression. Feature vectors are often combined with weights using a dot product in order to construct a linear predictor function that is used to determine a score for making a prediction. The vector space associated with these vectors is often called the feature space. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques can be employed. Higher-level features can be obtained from already available features and added to the feature vector; for example, for the study of diseases the feature 'Age' is useful and is defined as Age = 'Year of death' minus 'Year of birth' . This process is referred to as feature construction.Liu, H., Motoda H. (1998) Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining., Kluwer Academic Publishers. Norwell, MA, USA. 1998.Piramuthu, S., Sikora R. T. Iterative feature construction for improving inductive learning algorithms. In Journal of Expert Systems with Applications. Vol. 36 , Iss. 2 (March 2009), pp. 3401-3406, 2009 Feature construction is the application of a set of constructive operators to a set of existing features resulting in construction of new features. Examples of such constructive operators include checking for the equality conditions {=, ‚â†}, the arithmetic operators {+,‚àí,√ó, /}, the array operators {max(S), min(S), average(S)} as well as other more sophisticated operators, for example count(S,C)Bloedorn, E., Michalski, R.

Feature construction has long been considered a powerful tool for increasing both accuracy and understanding of structure, particularly in high-dimensional problems.Breiman, L.

Syntactic learning for ESEDA.1, tool for enhanced speech emotion detection and analysis. Internet Technology and Secured Transactions Conference 2009 (ICITST-2009), London, November 9‚Äì12. IEEE ==Selection and extraction== The initial set of raw features can be redundant and too large to be managed. Therefore, a preliminary step in many applications of machine learning and pattern recognition consists of selecting a subset of features, or constructing a new and reduced set of features to facilitate learning, and to improve generalization and interpretability. Extracting or selecting features is a combination of art and science; developing systems to do so is known as feature engineering. It requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and the combination of automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is feature learning, where a machine not only uses features for learning, but learns the features itself. == See also == * Covariate * Dimensionality reduction * Feature engineering * Hashing trick * Statistical classification *Explainable Artificial Intelligence ==References== Category:Data mining Category:Machine learning Category:Pattern recognition ","title":"Feature (machine learning)"},{"id":"1299407","text":"The Badawiyyah, Sufi tariqah, was founded in the thirteenth century in Egypt by Ahmad al-Badawi (1199-1276).

It is also the home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59 inches, on average). They were the subject of research by a variety of outsiders, including Patrick and Anne Eisner Putnam who lived on the banks of the Epulu River at the edge of the Ituri. They were also the subject of a study by Colin Turnbull, The Forest People, in 1962. The Ituri Rain forest was first traversed by Europeans in 1887 by Henry Morton Stanley on his Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. ==References== ==External links== * Blog by Biologists working on conservation in the Ituri forest * Osfac * Category:Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Category:Forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"Ituri Rainforest"},{"id":"1299439","text":"State Security may refer to: * general concepts of security agency or national security * Belgian State Security Service * State Security (Czechoslovakia) * Lebanese State Security ==See also== * Committee for State Security (disambiguation) ","title":"State Security"},{"id":"1299442","text":"Sleeping Beauty Castle is a fairy tale castle at the center of Disneyland, a redesigned and larger version at Disneyland Park (Paris) and formerly (being redesigned as of 2018) at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is based on the late-19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany.Imagineers (1998). Walt Disney Imagineering: A Behind the Dreams Look At Making the Magic Real. Disney Editions. . It appeared in the Walt Disney Pictures title card, and, along with Cinderella Castle, is an iconic symbol of The Walt Disney Company. The version at Disneyland is the only Disney castle whose construction was overseen by Walt Disney. ==Disneyland== Sleeping Beauty Castle decorated for Christmas Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle at night, February 2005. Neuschwanstein Castle Opened July 17, 1955, the castle is the oldest of all Disney castles. Though it reaches a height of , it was designed by Roland E. Hill to appear taller through a process known as forced perspective; design elements are larger at the foundation and smaller at the turrets. The castle initially featured an empty upper level that was never intended to house an attraction, but Walt Disney was not satisfied with what he viewed as wasted space, and challenged his Imagineers to find some use for the space. Beginning April 29, 1957, the visitors were able to walk through the castle and view several dioramas depicting the story of Sleeping Beauty. The voice of Jiminy Cricket from Walt Disney's Pinocchio (1940) singing \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" is piped into the castle. The original dioramas were designed in the style of Eyvind Earle, production designer for Disney's 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, and were then redone in 1977 to resemble the window displays on Main Street, U.S.A.. The walkthrough was closed for unspecified reasons on October 7, 2001; popular belief claims the September 11th attacks and the potential danger that ensued played a major factor in the closing. On July 17, 2008, Disney announced that the Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough would reopen in the style of the original Earle dioramas, enhanced with new technology not available in 1957. The walkthrough reopened on November 27, 2008 at 5:00 p.m., drawing long lines going as far back as the Hub at the center of the park. Unlike previous incarnations, visitors who are unable to climb stairs or navigate the passageways of the Castle can still experience the walkthrough \\"virtually\\" in a special room on the Castle's ground floor. This room is lavishly themed, and presents the closed-captioned CGI walkthrough recreation on a high-definition TV. This same virtual recreation is included on the Sleeping Beauty 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition DVD. The castle walkthrough entrance is on the west side of the building inside Fantasyland. Guests first see a large medieval-themed story book open to a page that announces the birth of the princess Aurora. After climbing the stairs inside, a scene depicts Aurora as a baby, being blessed with magic gifts by her fairy godmothers. Behind a glass window, there is an animation of the castle courtyard, and the king and queen watching as a large fire burns all the spinning wheels in the kingdom. At the top of the stairs, as guests reach the center of the castle's top level, another window looks out on the castle's great hall, where everyone in the kingdom is asleep, including servants and the cat and dog. The second half of the walkthrough becomes darker, featuring appearances by Maleficent, her crow, and several gargoyles which fly out of her nearby castle. At the end, the prince fights against Maleficent's incarnation as a dragon, amid a forest of thorny brambles, and then a field of roses appears with doves flying above, as he kisses Aurora and breaks the spell. As guests exit the walkthrough at the bottom of the stairs on the east side of the castle, another medieval-themed oversized book depicts an image of the prince and princess dancing together, as her dress changes colors from pink to blue and back again. The Disney family coat of arms hangs above the archway to the castle. It is composed of three lions passant in pale. It is known that the coat of arms was not originally on the castle, but was placed there sometime between June 1965 and July 1965. At the rear of the castle, shaded by the archways and driven into the ground is a gold spike that is widely, but wrongly, believed to mark the geographical center of Disneyland. In reality, the spike is a surveyor's mark that was used to ensure that the castle bridge and entrance lined up with Main Street USA when the park was first constructed. The original geographical center of the Magic Kingdom was in the middle of the round park, where the \\"Partners\\" statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse stands. The addition of Mickey's Toontown in 1993 moved the actual center of the park a few yards northward, but still on the hub side of the castle drawbridge. In January 2019, renovations on Sleeping Beauty Castle began in Disneyland. The entrance to Fantasyland was blocked through the archway of the castle during this refurbishment. ===Fiftieth anniversary=== In celebration of Disneyland's 50th anniversary, both Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella Castle received makeovers. In Disneyland, the castle was repainted and five turrets were decorated with stylized crowns, each representing a decade in the park's history: *The creation of Disneyland is represented by a pair of famous \\"Ears\\" peeking up over the horizon to see the wonders to come. *\\"A World on the Move\\", otherwise known as the \\"New Tomorrowland\\" of 1967, is represented by rocket ships and accented by opalescent planets. *The Blue Fairy represents the debut of the Main Street Electrical Parade. *The Indiana Jones Adventure is represented by the evil Eye of Mara, guarded by snakes. *The 50th Anniversary of Disneyland is represented by fireworks and Tinker Bell. The gold railings were also added into the second floor of the castle for the safety of pyrotechnics workers. They were removed after 10 years and replaced with hidden railings that move up only when needed. ===Sixtieth anniversary=== For Disneyland's 60th anniversary, World of Color changed to the World of Color: Celebrate! The Wonderful World of Walt Disney. Disneyland Park introduced Paint The Night and a new fireworks show, \\"Disneyland Forever\\". A 24-hour kickoff event occurred May 22, 2015. As part of the celebration, the castle was covered with diamonds and glitter, with a large 60th logo in the center. Carthay Circle Restaurant at Disney California Adventure was also decorated for the Diamond Celebration. Most of the decoration on the castle was removed shortly after the celebration, although the decorative faux roofs remained until January 2018. == Disneyland Park (Paris) == Sleeping Beauty Castle in 2006. Completed in 1992, for the park's 12 April opening, Sleeping Beauty Castle stands tall, the tallest of any Sleeping Beauty Castle and the third largest Disney castle after Cinderella Castle, Magic Kingdom and the Enchanted Storybook Castle at Shanghai Disneyland. Sleeping Beauty Castle (English for Le Ch√¢teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant) is at the centre of Disneyland Park and a continuation of Sleeping Beauty Castle first seen at Disneyland in California. The Castle features two parts, a dungeon area in the base featuring an Audio-Animatronic dragon and, above, a concrete balcony walkthrough area with Sleeping Beauty‚Äìthemed stained glass windows and tapestries. There are also several shops selling glass figures, ornaments and gifts. \\"Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland was inspired by the Neuschwanstein Castle in Southern Germany. This European influence was fine for building a castle in Anaheim, but the fact that castles exist just down the road from Disneyland Paris challenged us to think twice about our design.\\" ‚ÄîTony Baxter, executive designer Walt Disney ImagineeringImagineers (1998). Walt Disney Imagineering: A Behind the Dreams Look At Making the Magic Real. Disney Editions. . The castle has received several overlays throughout the years. The first occurred during the park's first anniversary celebration in 1993, when the castle was dressed up as a cake complete with strawberries, icing and candles. This overlay was removed after the celebration ended. The cake overlay concept was later copied by Walt Disney World's Cinderella Castle in 1996 for the 25th Anniversary of the resort. During the fifth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 1997, the castle was decorated in carnival masks, jester hats, frills and bells to promote the animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame. This overlay lasted until the beginning of 1998. During the tenth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 2002, the front of the castle was fitted with a golden scroll displaying a large 10. The celebration also saw the opening of Walt Disney Studios next door. The scroll and other anniversary material in the park were removed in 2003. In 2007, the castle received another overlay, celebrating the park's fifteenth anniversary. It featured golden Disney characters displayed on the turrets and spires, each holding a candle, and Tinkerbell on the highest spire. The candles were illuminated each night during a special 'Candlebration' ceremony which took place on a raised temporary stage at Central Plaza, in front of the Castle. A huge illuminated gold plaque featuring a large '15' was hung on the front of the castle. This echoed the overlay from the tenth anniversary in 2002. The fifteenth anniversary and the 'Candlebration' ceremony ended on March 7, 2009. The fifteenth anniversary overlay quickly followed on April 4, 2009 by Mickey's Magical Party, a \\"theme year\\" celebration held at the park. The castle was again overlaid, this time with a Mickey and Friends plaque over the main window, and the spire heads were changed from being characters to being 3 circles \\"of ribbon\\" representing Mickey Mouse. A more permanent Central Plaza stage was built outside the castle to host the \\"It's dance time... with Mickey and Friends\\" show. The castle was repainted in a new colour-scheme, restored and fitted with multicolored LED lighting during 2011. For the Disney Dreams nighttime spectacular show its moat was fitted with water fountains, the upper window was replaced by doors that open to reveal a LED lighted star and Central Plaza stage was removed in order to increase the viewing area. ==Hong Kong Disneyland== Sleeping Beauty Castle at Hong Kong Disneyland Hong Kong's Sleeping Beauty Castle was a nearly identical copy of the original in California. However, the two castles were differentiated through very subtle details. Hong Kong Disneyland used a different color scheme compared to that of Disneyland, with more natural white and pink colours for the accents and cornice. It also had fewer trees surrounding its castle, which allowed a more open view to accompany the nightly fireworks show. The castle closed on January 1, 2018 for a redesign as part of the park's 15th anniversary celebration. This redesign is meant to pay tribute to 13 Disney princesses and heroines. It has been renamed Castle of Magical Dreams. ===During the 5th Anniversary=== In celebration of Hong Kong Disneyland's fifth anniversary, Celebration in the Air, the castle was transformed into Tinker Bell's Pixie Dusted Castle. The castle was decorated with golden pixie dust, which sparkled and shimmered in the sun and was illuminated by night. ===During the 10th Anniversary=== Although no significant decorations were added to Hong Kong Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle for the park's 10th anniversary, the nightly \\"Disney In The Stars\\" fireworks show was added with elaborate projection mapping with visuals to complement the display. This, however, resulted in the elimination of a few pyrotechnic elements launched from the front of the castle during the show. ==Logo usage== As Sleeping Beauty Castle is a Disney icon, it and Magic Kingdom's Cinderella Castle have become the basis for the logo of Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television, Disney Music Group and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was also heavily featured in advertisements for the Wonderful World of Disney, formerly shown on the Disney Channel. ==See also== * Le Ch√¢teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant * Cinderella Castle * Castle of Magical Dreams * Enchanted Storybook Castle ==References== Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1955 Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2005 Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts icons Category:Disneyland Category:Sleeping Beauty (1959 film) Category:Fantasyland Category:Castles in California Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1955 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2005 Category:1955 establishments in California Category:2005 establishments in Hong Kong Category:2018 disestablishments in Hong Kong ","title":"Sleeping Beauty Castle"},{"id":"1299443","text":"Far Rockaway is a neighborhood on the eastern part of the Rockaway peninsula in the New York City borough of Queens. It is the easternmost section of the Rockaways. The neighborhood extends from Beach 32nd Street east to the Nassau County line. Its southern boundary is the Atlantic Ocean; it is one of the neighborhoods along Rockaway Beach. Far Rockaway is located in Queens Community District 14 and its ZIP Code is 11691. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 101st Precinct. ==History== Grand View Avenue in the 1910s The indigenous inhabitants of the Rockaways were the Canarsie Indians, a band of Mohegan, whose name was associated with the geography. By 1639, the Mohegan tribe sold most of the Rockaways to the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, the English defeated the Dutch colony and took over their lands in present-day New York.See New AmsterdamHenry L. Schoolcraft, \\"The Capture of New Amsterdam\\", English Historical Review (1907). Vol. 22 #88, pp 674‚Äì693 in JSTOR In 1685, the band chief, Tackapoucha, and the English governor of the province agreed to sell the Rockaways to a Captain Palmer for 31 pounds sterling.* \\"Rockaway...

The Rockaway Peninsula was originally designated as part of the Town of Hempstead, then a part of Queens County. Palmer and the Town of Hempstead disputed over who owned Rockaway, so in 1687 he sold the land to Richard Cornell, an iron master from Flushing. Cornell and his family lived on a homestead on what is now Central Avenue, near the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. At his death, Cornell was buried in a small family cemetery, Cornell Cemetery. In the late 19th century, the Rockaway Association wanted to build a hotel on the Rockaway Peninsula, as it was increasingly popular as a summer destination. The association, consisting of many wealthy members who had homes in the area, bought most of Cornell's old homestead property. They developed the Marine Hotel on that site, which attracted such guests as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Washington Irving, and the Vanderbilt family. The Rockaway Association also built the Rockaway Turnpike. The Marine Hotel burned to the ground in 1864, but more hotels and private residences were built in the area. In the 19th century, people traveled to the Rockaways by horse-drawn carriages or on horseback. A ferry powered by steam sailed from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn. By the 1880s, the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch was built to serve Far Rockaway station. The steam railroad went to Long Island City and Flatbush Terminal (now Atlantic Terminal). When it opened in the 1880s, this connection stimulated population growth on the Rockaway Peninsula., p. 120. Benjamin Mott gave the LIRR of land for a railroad depot. Land values increased and businesses in the area grew, and by 1888, Far Rockaway was a relatively large village. It incorporated as a village on September 19 of that year.Documents of the Senate of the State of New York, Volume 8, p. 9. New Jersey Legislature, 1913. Accessed July 26, 2016. By 1898, the area was incorporated into the Greater City of New York, which included Queens. Far Rockaway, Hammels, and Arverne, all of Queens, tried to secede from the city several times. In 1915 and 1917, a bill approving the secession passed in the legislature but was vetoed by the New York City mayor John Purroy Mitchel. ==Demographics== Rooftop view of Far Rockaway Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Far Rockaway was 50,058, a change of 1,714 (3.4%) from the 48,344 counted in 2000.

Far Rockaway is a diverse neighborhood with many Immigrants from Jamaica, Guyana, and Guatemala, as well as Russia, and Ukraine. ==Points of interest== ===Bungalows=== Looking east from Beach 48th Street at location of former bungalows cleared for a development project The Far Rockaway Beach Bungalow Historic District recognizes an area with a distinct character. This and individual properties, such as the Russell Sage Memorial Church, Trinity Chapel, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With its nearby beach, Far Rockaway attracted tourists and vacationers from the other boroughs. Bungalows were the homes of choice for many residents who lived in Far Rockaway. The railroad abandoned the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1950 because of the shift of many people to driving private cars. In addition, this destination had to compete with the many others that people were visiting by car and air travel, which created access to even more distant destinations and heightened competition for travel dollars. As the neighborhood's heyday as a resort community declined in the 1950s, the city built substantial numbers of public housing developments to try to replace substandard housing after World War II. Bungalows and other residential housing were converted to year-round use for low-income residents. Some bungalows were used as public housing. The 1970s New York City budget crisis resulted in a negative effect on the provision of social services, and problems of poverty, unemployment and drug use increased in this area. In September 1984, residents founded the Beachside Bungalow Preservation Association to \\"improve the quality of the Far Rockaway community through preservation, education, and cultural programs.\\" \\" The organization donated a collection of materials highlighting its history, correspondence, and activities to the Queens Library Archives in 2008. ===Parks=== * O'Donohue Park * Bayswater Park ==Police and crime== Far Rockaway is patrolled by the NYPD's 101st Precinct, located at 16-12 Mott Avenue. The 101st Precinct and the adjoining 100th Precinct, which serves the rest of the Rockaways, collectively ranked 10th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. However, the low-income and densely populated 101st Precinct has significantly more crime than the 100th Precinct, which is high-income and more insular. The 101st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 74.6% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 6 murders, 26 rapes, 151 robberies, 301 felony assaults, 98 burglaries, 250 grand larcenies, and 31 grand larcenies auto in 2018. == Fire safety == Far Rockaway is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)'s Engine Cos. 264 and 328/Ladder Co. 134, located at 16-15 Central Avenue. == Post office and ZIP Code == Far Rockaway is covered by ZIP Code 11691. The United States Post Office operates the Far Rockaway Station at 18-36 Mott Avenue. ==Education== ===Schools=== ====Public schools==== The neighborhood, like all of New York City, is served by the New York City Department of Education. Far Rockaway residents are zoned to several different elementary schools: * P.S. 43 * P.S. 104 (The Bayswater School) (Kindergarten‚Äì6th grade) * P.S. 105 (The Bay School) * P.S. 106 * P.S. 197 (The Ocean School) * P.S. 215 (Lucretia Mott) * P.S. 253 Far Rockaway residents are zoned to M.S. 53 Brian Piccolo. All New York City residents who wish to attend a public high school must apply to high schools. Far Rockaway High School was located in Far Rockaway, but was shut down in 2011 as a stand- alone institution. During the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2011, many large, underperforming, older traditional high schools were closed in the city. The 1929 building was renovated to operate as the Far Rockaway Educational Campus, home to a number of smaller, specialized academies that share the building. They can provide more individualized attention to their students. The former Beach Channel High School was similarly closed in 2014 and repurposed to house several smaller, specialized academies; it is in Rockaway Park, near Far Rockaway, and draws some of its students from Far Rockaway. ====Private and charter schools==== Church of God Christian Academy is a K‚Äì12 co-ed school, located on Central Avenue. Nikitas Language Abroad Schools, a series of language schools, is also located in Far Rockaway. Challenge Preparatory Charter School on Hartman Lane is publicly funded and run by a private non-profit entity; it serves elementary and middle-school pupils.Challenge Preparatory Charter School  Far Rockaway, NY ===Library=== Queens Public Library operates the Far Rockaway branch at a temporary location at 1003 Beach 20th Street. The library was formerly located at Central Avenue. In 2013 New York magazine reported that the city planned to construct a public library in the neighborhood, to be designed by the internationally known architectural firm Sn√∏hetta. Construction started in November 2018. ===Jewish institutions=== During the early and mid-20th century, many Jewish immigrants and their working-class descendants settled in Far Rockaway, sometimes first as summer visitors. They founded numerous synagogues and private schools, including those devoted to all boys or all girls institutions for educating Orthodox children. Following World War II, as residential housing was developed in Nassau and later Suffolk counties, many Jewish families left the Rockaways for newer housing. According to The New York Times, Far Rockaway had \\"flourished in the 1940s but withered .. 1960s\\" until \\"a few Jewish families .. started the Hebrew Free Loan Society for new home buyers.\\" Synagogues (past and present): * Agudath Israel of Long Island * Agudath Israel of Rockaway * Agudath Israel of West Lawrence * Bayswater Jewish Center * Beis Medrash Ateres Yisroel (Rabbi Avraham Blumenkranz) * Bnos Israel Institute (Rabbi Shmelke Rubin) * Congregation Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway (The White Shul) * Congregation Shaarey Tefila * Congregation Shaarey Zedek * Khal Bais Shmuel Abba * Young Israel of Far Rockaway * Young Israel of Bayswater Schools (past and present): * Chaim Berlin High School * Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway (HAFTR) * Mesivta Chaim Shlomo * Mesivta Toras Moshe * Bnois Bais Yaakov * Tichon Meir Moshe * Sh'or Yoshuv Institute of Jewish Studies/Sh'or Yoshuv Yeshiva * Siach Yitzchok Elementary School for Boys * Torah Academy for Girls * Bais Yaakov Ateres Miriam * Yeshiva Darchei Torah (Far Rockaway) * Yeshiva of Far Rockaway * The Hebrew Institute of Long Island * Yeshiva Bnei Torah ==Transportation== Elevated subway viaduct Far Rockaway is served by the following transportation services: * The New York City Subway's IND Rockaway Line (), which has a terminal at Mott Avenue. * The Far Rockaway terminal station for the Long Island Rail Road's Far Rockaway Branch. The branch had been part of a loop with service along the existing route, continuing through the Rockaway Peninsula and crossing on a trestle across Jamaica Bay through Queens, where it reconnected with other branches. Frequent fires and maintenance problems led the LIRR to abandon the Queens portion of the route. The city acquired this to develop the IND Rockaway Line.IND Rockaway Branch/Jamaica Bay Crossing, accessed June 14, 2006. * MTA Regional Bus Operations: * Nassau Inter-County Express: .
