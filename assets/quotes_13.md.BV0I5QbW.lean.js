The series is a best-seller in Japan, having sold more than 18 million copies as of February 2007, with new volumes regularly entering the best-seller lists. It received the 2004 Kodansha Manga Award for best sh≈çjo manga. The series has been adapted as two separate television series. First, a live- action television was broadcast in 11 episodes on Fuji TV between 16 October and 25 December 2006, followed by a two-episode sequel series in January 2008. Two live-action movies, continuing the television drama with the same actors, have been announced with an anticipated release in 2010. Second, an anime series was adapted by J.C.Staff, also produced and broadcast by Fuji TV in two seasons. The first season was broadcast in 24 episodes from 11 January to 28 June 2007, and the second season began on 8 October 2008 with broadcasts on- going. A third season has been announced to be broadcast in the fall of 2009. Nodame Cantabile centres around aspiring conductor Shinichi Chiaki and Megumi Noda, an extremely talented pianist. As students at the Momogaoka College of Music in Japan, they have many friends with their own musical ambitions, in particular Ryutaro Mine and Masumi Okuyama, and teachers like conductor Franz von Stresemann and piano instructor Kouzou Etoh to guide them. Early on, the series focuses on the S-Orchestra, a group of maverick students chosen specifically by Stresemann, who leaves them to be conducted by Chiaki. Several notable members go on to join the Rising Star Orchestra (R‚òÜS Orchestra) partially founded and also conducted by Chiaki; the formation of the new orchestra introduces several new colleagues for Chiaki, including violinist Kiyora Miki and oboe player Yasunori Kuroki. When Chiaki and Nodame move to Paris to launch Chiaki's career as a professional conductor and for Nodame to continue her studies as a pianist, they find new friends and rivals, as well as remaining in contact with their friends from Japan. Along with the Conservatoire students, Tanya, Franck, and Yunlong, who share the same boarding house as Nodame and Chiaki, they meet famed musicians, like Son Rui, and conductor Jean Donnedieu. ==Main characters== ; :Also known as , which is a portmanteau of her family name and the first phoneme of her given name. Noda is, at the start of the series, a twenty-year-old free-spirited second-year music student. She is depicted as a complete slob: her cooking and cleaning skills are atrocious to the point of having mushrooms growing on her clothes and poisoning anyone who dares to eat her food (yet she's never been poisoned). However, she is an incredibly talented pianist who primarily plays by ear, in a cantabile style. :In love with Chiaki, she follows him around constantly, claiming to be his \\"wife,\\" and leans on him to help her get through sticky situations. She sometimes compulsively needs to play the piano, neglecting everything in order to do it. As well as that, she seems to enjoy childish manga and movies. She is constantly hungry, and is fed dinners by Chiaki; she also steals many lunches from her fellow friend, Maki. Nodame has a tendency to speak cryptically (sometimes she doesn't even understand herself), often refers to herself in the third person, and uses nonsense words like and . : Nodame is initially very dependent on Chiaki in terms of ambition - she has little intention of becoming a professional pianist, despite her remarkable talent, and wants to become a kindergarten teacher, though many feel she is too reckless and lacks the appropriate sensibility to be responsible with teaching children. :Her piano style is considered to be completely haphazard, diverting from original intent at both dynamics, rhythms and even themes. Realizing that her current attitude towards music will eventually drive her apart from Chiaki, Nodame gradually develops the necessary drive to pursue music for her own sake. Her attitude towards music is largely due to an incident in the past where she was hurt by a teacher who demanded her to play music \\"as it's written\\". Despite this, several people have commented on how captivating her piano is, and how she is able to draw rich, expressive notes from the piano. :Eventually, she goes with Chiaki to France for further education in music. Due to her carefree attitude towards music previously, she struggles to keep up with the rest of the class in terms of in-depth knowledge and techniques, but manages to overcome the trials laid before her and begins to \\"truly\\" appreciate music. Near the end of the series, she performed with Stresemann on stage (he was attempting to pull her out of an emotional slump), and was an instant world-wide hit. :During their stay in France, Chiaki and Nodame become a couple, with Chiaki once stating that \\"he got tired of fighting her\\". :Nodame's character is based on a real-life counterpart with same name. Juri Ueno received Best Actress awards for her depiction of Megumi Noda at the 2007 Japanese Drama Academy Awards and the 2008 International Drama Festival in Tokyo.http://nab.or.jp/drafes/english/index.html : Live action actor: Juri Ueno ; :Chiaki is twenty-one years old and a 3rd-year piano student at Momogaoka Music Academy at the start of the series. He is an accomplished pianist and violinist, but is also known to be a perfectionist when it comes to music and is highly critical of himself and others. As he opens up to others (with much prodding from Nodame), he becomes more caring of his friends and readily lends a hand to his friends should they need help. In university, he was extremely popular among the female students due to his good looks and musical ability. :He comes from a distinguished and well-off family, and is an excellent cook (although he mostly cooks Western-style food, possibly because he spent much of his childhood in Europe). He seems to think that most \\"poor\\" people (such as Sakura Saku) are like the little match girl. While he dreams of studying abroad and becoming a famous conductor like his mentor, Sebastiano Viera, he must overcome his fear of flying and the sea to do so (he finally did with help of Nodame's hypnosis). His fears come from traumatic incidents in the past, one when he survived an airplane crash landing, the other because he was almost drowned. His family once attempted to drug him and bring him on board a plane, but the plane had to turn back due to difficulties. :He is dismayed to discover that this freakish but talented girl, Nodame, lives in the apartment next door to him. However, he develops a sort of empathy with Nodame as he discovers her hidden potential to be a great pianist, and he begins to transcend his perfectionism and begins to enjoy his music and the music of others. Despite his constant irritation towards Nodame, he eventually develops romantic feelings toward her and he chooses to find work as a conductor in Paris, where she is going to study. As Chiaki realizes his life's ambition to become a conductor, he also finds that he needs Nodame's support and he cannot move on without her. He also appears to have fear of being abandoned and surpassed, the former comes from being abandoned by his father as a young boy. Afraid of being abandoned, he often abandons other people instead, especially Nodame. In various instances, he's also shown to have reservation over being \\"too friendly\\" with others, (mentioned in a rehearsal with RS orchestra). He's constantly afraid of being surpassed by Nodame, trying to go ever ahead, which leaves her miserable as she is trying to catch up to him. He also can be considered as insensitive. :He is one of the major factors in Nodame's progress in music, occasionally taking the time to extensively coach her during critical periods. In turn, he too is influenced and inspired strongly by her music. :During university, he became the student/apprentice of Stresemann, and while Chiaki is constantly irritated by Stresemann's numerous vices (visiting nightclubs frequently, chasing women, drinking, etc), he respects his teacher's music and ability in conducting. This relationship sees a continuation when they move to France, where Chiaki is coerced by Stresemann's manager Elise into signing a contract with their agency. :As the series progresses, he actually starts to develop feelings for Nodame, especially while they are in France. Despite his popularity among women, he is somewhat surprisingly devoted, and once their relationship solidifies is never seen to be unfaithful to her, once explicitly declining Rui's invitation for a date and stating that he was going to meet up with Nodame. However, they do go through the occasional rough patch, partially because they spend large amounts of time apart (as a conductor and Stresemann's student, Chiaki travels all over Europe), and both Chiaki and Nodame are prone to bouts of insecurity. :At the end of series, he is slowly advancing his career as a conductor, with an orchestra that has a long history but had since fallen on tough times. He successfully remakes the orchestra's declining image little by little. : Live action actor: Hiroshi Tamaki ==Supporting characters== ; :Stresemann is an elderly, highly respected internationally famous conductor who comes to Momogaoka Music Academy as a guest instructor. In love with the Academy's Director, he comes as a favor and immediately is pegged as an oddball lecher. Perverted, demanding, and not at all dignified, Stresemann seems to be opposite of what his reputation makes him. :Stresemann, however, immediately takes to Nodame, and even accepts Chiaki as his one and only apprentice after repeatedly rejecting his application to enroll in his conducting classes. His wild behavior constantly gets Chiaki in trouble, but he also teaches him how to feel and express music in a way that only he can. He often takes his orchestra out for mixers or group dates, and go to night clubs and host clubs (especially a place called One More Kiss) instead of attending the rehearsals he is supposed to conduct. He also gets drunk easily, forcing Chiaki to take over for him as vice- conductor. :Stresemann is eventually forcibly taken back to Europe to continue his professional life by his hardnosed assistant, Elise. He develops a fatherly-like affection towards both Nodame and Chiaki, and gives them advice and help along the way. He is also responsible for Nodame's sudden and sensational launch into the world of professional music; upon seeing her in an emotional slump, he decides to give her an opportunity to perform one piece at his upcoming concert. :He has an ongoing rivalry with Sebastian Veira (although this may just be in his own mind), and seems to be connected to Auclair as well (Nodame's teacher in France). Both do not seem to hold him in any high regard, possibly due to his frivolous attitude and notorious reputation for being a womanizer. :Nearing the end of the series, he is said to be beginning to lose hearing in one of his ears, although supposedly it did not have a great impact on his career yet. He also goes through depression whenever one of his friends from his own generation passes away, and whines about how he'll be next. : Live action actor: Naoto Takenaka ; :4th-year Violin student in Momogaoka. His father owns a Chinese restaurant \\"Uraken\\" right next to the university. He is something of a primadonna whose violin technique is seen by himself to be deeply personal but by others to be simply sloppy. He sees Chiaki as a rival for attention and tries hard to compete with his \\"Princely\\" image of him. He likes Nodame for her free-spirited ways. He is the concertmaster of the S Orchestra conducted by Chiaki, and a violinist in the R‚òÜS Orchestra. He is also the one who thought that performing like Jimi Hendrix, and adding a touch of 'rock' would give quality despite that it looks dumb in an original orchestra (as stated by Chiaki). He has been dating Kiyora Miki. :Later on he becomes the manager for an opera/musical group which Chiaki occasionally conducts the orchestra for. : Live action actor: Eita ; :A talented oboe player who falls for Nodame at first sight (oblivious to her true nature, he sees her as pure, simplistic, and adorable) and performs the inaugural solo of the R‚òÜS orchestra. Because he tends to be phlegmatic and quiet, many members of the R‚òÜS orchestra think of him as \\"samurai-like\\". Though he is crushed and distracted after learning about Nodame's love for Chiaki, Kuroki becomes a good friend to both Nodame and Chiaki and goes on to study abroad in France with them. :Once there, he has much difficulty adjusting to the language, people, and culture, making it hard for him to socialize and make friends. His awkward and quiet demeanor earned him the scorn and nickname \\"Glauque\\" from Tanya (meaning dark and depressing, also means green/blue-ish). However they warm up to each other later. Kuroki later becomes a member of the Roux-Marlet Orchestra conducted by Chiaki. :As the series progresses, he and Tanya begin to get along. Tanya even plays piano accompaniment for him. By the end of Nodame Cantabile - Opera Hen, he has proposed to Tanya. : Live action actor: Seiji Fukushi ; :A prodigious violinist Chiaki met at the Nina Lutz's seminar, she joins him to form the R‚òÜS Orchestra as his concertmaster. She also becomes Mine's girlfriend. In all media, she had studied abroad in Vienna and had received private tutoring from the Berlin Philharmonics concertmaster, Kai Dowin. She also returns abroad a year after they started the R‚òÜS Orchestra, after she is replaced as concertmaster of R‚òÜS by Noriyuki Takahashi. In the live-action version, she was a student of Momogaoka and concertmaster of A Orchestra, where she became friends with Masumi. : Live action actor: Asami Mizukawa ==In Japan== ; :A claustrophobic 4th-year timpanist (percussion), who is an okama. He is homosexual. He developed a crush on Chiaki and always admired him from afar. He barely spoke to Chiaki until Nodame's arrival. Since Nodame starts to hang out with Chiaki, he considers her as a rival and often bullies her and anyone else who tries to get close to Chiaki. Despite his idiosyncrasies, he excels on his percussion skills, earning him the title of \\"Queen of Percussion\\" and a place in the S and R‚òÜS orchestras conducted by Chiaki. He becomes a professional timpanist when he is hired by the New Metropolitan Philharmonic. Even so, he still makes time for R‚òÜS activities. :He is one of Nodame's best friends. He credits Nodame for helping him become friends with Chiaki and helps to keep others away from Chiaki. They maintain contact throughout her stay in France. : Live action actor: Keisuke Koide ; :Chiaki's former girlfriend. Coming from a wealthy family, she majors in singing (more specifically opera). She is the \\"belle\\" of the school due to her looks and voice. :Despite breaking up with Chiaki and Saiko has been in love with him all along. She broke up with him because when it came to music, he was equally critical of everyone including her, and yet even though he was far more talented than everyone (and herself), he was the most critical of himself, and that made it hard being with him. After breaking up with Chiaki she goes through a few relationships, but because of her lingering attraction to Chiaki, is never able to fully put him behind her. :Later on, she comes to terms with the fact that Chiaki has moved on without her, and presumably moves on as well. :Saiko sometimes exhibits a spiteful streak in her, especially to those whom she views as rivals, but is also capable of gentleness. Once, when a drunken Nodame bumped into Saiko at a karaoke restroom, Saiko first smacks her away, then after realizing Nodame was drunk, gave Nodame her shawl before leaving. : Live action actor: Misa Uehara ; :A double bass player in Chiaki's S orchestra, whose family was in financial trouble because her father's business was about to go bankrupt. A student of very short height, Sakura was mistaken as an elementary student when she first came into the orchestra, and as her instrument is much larger than she is, people usually do not see her when she is carrying it on her back, thinking it is moving by itself. Upon paying them a home visit, Chiaki and Nodame are shown her father's collection of rare and extremely expensive violins, even though he cannot play them. Chiaki promptly blows up and orders him to sell all of them. :She is later seen dating another cellist from the S-Orchestra. In the manga and anime, her role in the story ends with S-Orchestra; in the live-action drama, she remains a permanent character and becomes member of the R‚òÜS Orchestra. : Live action actor: Saeko ; :A piano teacher also known as the \\"harisen teacher\\" (Paper Fan-sensei), because he always carries one during his class which uses to punish his students for their mistakes. He was Chiaki's teacher at the start of the story, but after Chiaki blew up at him for scoffing at his dream of being a conductor, Etoh threw Chiaki out of his class. This was one of the first setbacks Chiaki faced in the series, as Etoh was known in the school for tutoring only elite students. :One day he heard Nodame practicing and decided to become her teacher, going so far as to forcibly transfer Nodame to his class. The relationship does not start well, as his overbearing attitude and use of physical rebukes (he would smack his students with his paper fan) reminds Nodame of her piano tutor when she was young, and causes her to run away from him. He eventually gives up his harisen in order to convince Nodame to take lessons from him. :Nodame, in order to attend an upcoming competition, stayed at Etoh and his wife's place for training. He is not above tricking Nodame, using her love of Purigorota cartoon characters and free lunches, to convince her to perform or listen his advice. In contrast to Etoh's severity, his wife is a light-hearted and loving woman who often takes care of the students who study with Etoh. :He was one of the first few to note Nodame's talent and train her, and notes that even past her superb technique and musical talent, she has an innate ability to move people through her music. He was a major factor in Nodame's advance in music, and when Nodame was in a slump due to her loss at her first competition (she lost due to a lack of time to memorize all the necessary songs), submitted an application to an overseas musical college for her. :After Nodame became famous, one of the first things she did when she returned to Japan was to give Etoh and Tanioka a private recital, presumably in appreciation of their help. : Live action actor: Kosuke Toyohara ; : A piano teacher at Momogaoka, said to specialize in \\"drop-out\\" students. Chiaki is re-assigned to Tanioka after his loud argument with Kouzou Etoh in chapter 1. He discovers that Nodame is already a student of Tanioka's, and one of the first assignments Tanioka assigns him is to perform a Mozart piano duet with Nodame, which also entails teaching her, and himself, the focus and discipline to play well with others. : Live action actor: Masahiko Nishimura ; : A womanizing cello player and one of the founders of the R‚òÜS Orchestra along Chiaki, Kiyora, and Kuroki. Easily recognizable by his crew cut and small glasses. He had been studying in Boston prior to the creation of the R‚òÜS Orchestra, and at the end of that year, had returned to Boston. : Live action actor: Mukai Osamu ==In Paris== ; :A French piano student who lives in the same apartment complex as Chiaki and Nodame. He befriended Nodame when they were taking the entrance exam to study in Paris. He is a fan of Japanese anime, his special favorites are the anime Shakugan no Shana and Nodame's favorite series, the fictional Puri Gorota. He had a slight crush on Nodame, but fell out of it once he saw her obsession with anime (which he said was too much for even him to handle, as she could recite all the lines of Puri Gorota from heart) and Chiaki. Franck previously studied at the same school as Yunlong, but after seeing Professor Auclair, chose to transfer to the Conservatory. : Live action actor: Eiji Wentz ; :An attractive Russian senior piano student who lives in the same apartment complex as Chiaki, Nodame, Franck, and Yunlong. Her piano playing is somewhat skillful but she lacks motivation and confidence in her ability, which seems to be the reason behind her fixation on finding an affluent boyfriend in France. She initially finds Kuroki rather gloomy, but eventually develops strong feelings for him. :After being influenced by Nodame and company, she finds the motivation to work harder on her piano but is too late to improve them enough to place in a competition she took part in. She later becomes Kuroki's accompanist on the piano, and accepts his marriage proposal. : Live action actor: Becky ; : A piano player who lives in the same apartment complex as Nodame and Chiaki do in Paris. He is Chinese and tends to become very sentimental, especially when homesickness is mentioned. He attends a different Conservatory than Nodame. In contrast to Chiaki and Nodame, he is driven to succeed by the expectations of his family. He has intense stage fright. :When Chiaki went on a world tour for 3 months, Yunlong and Nodame developed a good friendship which made Chiaki, on his return, uncomfortable and unwilling to meet Yunlong. After a mediocre performance at a piano competition Tanya also participated in, he reluctantly considers returning to China to become a piano teacher. He enjoys eating good food, particularly if Chiaki cooks or pays for it. : ; :A world-famous Chinese pianist who is making a gradual comeback, Rui takes a liking to Chiaki soon after meeting him, and treats him like a younger brother; she particularly likes teasing him about Nodame. Rui's appearance in Chiaki's life results in Nodame becoming jealous as well as insecure in her ability to perform on a level that will fit Chiaki's, particularly as Rui's fame unintentionally thwarts several attempts for Nodame to perform with Chiaki. Rui eventually decides to study music in Paris, though is met with opposition from her well- meaning mother, who pressures Rui to perform in more public performances. Though skilled, she lacks the style and substance of Nodame's performances and seeks to find the same element in order to improve her own musical ability. : Live action actor: Yu Yamada ; : Another of Viella's students, who also works in Paris and considers himself a rival to Chiaki. He has a very affectionate and devoted, if a bit arrogant, girlfriend named Yuko, whom Jean regards as his \\"Goddess of Victory\\". : Live action actor: Giry Vincent ; :An esteemed and well-known professor of piano at the Conservatory where Nodame studies. During Nodame's piano competition in Japan, he is one of the judges and is captivated by her performance, but soon detects her immaturity in attitude towards music, referring her as \\"still a baby\\" (later on \\"Bebe-chan\\"). Auclair offers Nodame (through Etoh) an opportunity to study in Paris and selects her to become one of his students, much to Frank's envy. He refers to Nodame as \\"Bebe-chan\\" and sees that she has tremendous potential, but limited time to hone her skill and recognizes Nodame's reluctance to become a professional pianist. :He enjoys food and cooking. : ==Other characters== ; : Elise is Stresemann's hard-nosed agent and business manager. Aided by her bodyguard Oliver she kidnapped Chiaki in volume 11 and forced him to sign with her agency too. She is not above trickery or aggressive methods to ensure the success of her clients, often forcing them to endure demanding schedules. : Live action actor: Michiko Kichise ; : World-renowned conductor and Chiaki's mentor. Stresemann is rather adverse towards Viella and initially extended his dislike of the conductor to Chiaki. Viella has considered Chiaki as his apprentice since the boy was twelve and is a surrogate father figure to Chiaki. Viella is an acquaintance of both of Chiaki's parents. : Live action actor: Zdenƒõk M√°cal (Voiced by: Takeshi Aono (Japanese)) ; : Chiaki's mother, who retained custody of Chiaki after her divorce with Chiaki's father. She and Chiaki lived in Europe for several years during Chiaki's childhood, during which Chiaki became Viella's student, before they returned to Japan. She is frequently away from home on business and does work involving culture and music. She takes a liking to Nodame, especially after she cured her son of his phobia. She is respected by the students in Chiaki and Nodame's boarding house as their patron and is referred to as \\"Madame Seiko.\\" ;Chiaki's family : Chiaki's maternal family, who include his uncle Takehiko and his younger cousins Toshihiko and Yuiko. They desperately want Chiaki to be able to achieve his dream of becoming a conductor and tried various methods, from hypnotism to knocking Chiaki unconscious in order to get him to leave Japan. While they find Nodame extremely strange, they grow to like her, especially young Yuiko, and believe she is talented enough to be a professional concert pianist but would not be a very good kindergarten teacher as Nodame wants to become. They are overjoyed when Chiaki finally overcomes his fear of flying on planes. ; : Chiaki's absentee father, a famous pianist throughout Europe. He and Chiaki's mother divorced when Chiaki was very young and Chiaki resents how his father never tried to spend time with him. He appears to be a selfish man who dislikes how his old acquaintances insist of trying to unite him with his son. Neither Chiaki or Masayuki openly contact one another. ; : The conductor Chiaki chooses to replace him as conductor of the Rising Star Orchestra (R‚òÜS). ; : The musical director of the Roux-Marlet Orchestra in Paris. He hires Chiaki as the Orchestra's new resident conductor after hearing his performance at his Paris Debut and at the recommendation of Stresemann who used to be the Conductor of the orchestra. Like the character of Megumi Noda, he is based on a real person of the same name. The real James DePriest was Permanent Conductor of The Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from 2005 to 2008. DePriest also conducted the Nodame Orchestra, which provided the music for both the live-action drama and anime adaptations. :Live action actor: James DePriest (Voiced by: Akihiko Ishizumi (Japanese))

Pacific Comics ","title":"List of Pacific Comics publications"},{"id":"20387645","text":"Concerted cultivation is a style of parenting. The expression is attributed to Annette Lareau. This parenting style or parenting practice is marked by a parent's attempts to foster their child's talents by incorporating organized activities in their children's lives. This parenting style is commonly exhibited in middle class and upper class American families, and is also characterized by consciously developing language use and ability to interact with social institutions. Many have attributed cultural benefits to this form of child-rearing due to the style's use in higher income families, conversely affecting the social habitus of children raised in such a manner. A child that has been concertedly cultivated will often express greater social prowess in social situations involving formality or structure attributed to their increased experience and engagement in organized clubs, sports, musical groups as well as increased experience with adults and power structure. While this pattern of child rearing holds no innate positive qualities, it has been linked to an increase in financial and academic success. Negative considerations have included an overburdened sense of entitlement, potentially disrespectful behavior toward authority figures, lack of creativity, and the psychosomatic inability to play or relax. As a result, advocates of Slow parenting prefer less management of childhood activities. None of these effects can be considered without broader cultural and economic considerations. Concerted cultivation also emphasizes the use of reasoning skills and variations in language use. Parents start to encourage their children to learn how to speak with adults so that they become comfortable and understand the importance of eye contact and speaking properly at an earlier age. According to Lareau, with these type of experiences, middle-class parents try to pursue the concerted cultivation approach. They also try to promote a sense of entitlement in their children, middle class children are encouraged to see adults as their equals. Concerted cultivation causes a transmission of differential advantages, meaning they end up having a financial and educational advantage in life over children reared based on other methods. Children who are reared using the concerted cultivation method are set apart in academic environments, such as college campuses, and they also learn to have more confidence when confronted with social interactions. Children start to form a certain sense of entitlement because of their early comfort interacting with adults. Children also become more comfortable questioning adults, and it is easier for them to see themselves as equals. With concerted cultivation, the practices often infiltrate into the family life. Frequent gatherings provide opportunities for further cultivation such as eating at the dinner table together. ==Structured activities== American middle class parents engage in concerted cultivation parenting by attempting to foster children's talents through organized leisure activities, which theoretically teach them to respect authority and how to interact in a structured environment. Learning how to interact in a structured environment much like a classroom gives students a head start in school because they are identified as intelligent or 'good' students. Other aspects of concerted cultivation include emphasis on reasoning skills and language use. Parents challenge their children to think critically and to speak properly and frequently, especially when interacting with adults. These skills also set the child apart in academic settings as well as give them confidence in social situations. By learning these traits, they are advancing themselves in their surroundings. Another difference is the involvement parents have in their children's lives. Parents are much more involved in following their children's academic progression. Through this process children from a concerted cultivation upbringing supposedly feel more entitled in their academic endeavors and will feel more responsible because they know that their parents are highly involved. ==Parenting practices== In social stratification (a specific area of study in sociology) different parenting practices lead children to have different upbringings. Differences in child rearing are identified and associated with different social classes. The two types of child rearing that are introduced by Annette Lareau are concerted cultivation and natural growth. Concerted cultivation parenting is associated with those parents who have traditionally white collar jobs and those considered to be part of the upper class. Natural growth parenting is associated with blue collar workers of the working class. Parenting practices do not apply exclusively to social classes, but they are highly correlated. She claims that the only defining factor as to how a child is raised is the amount of credit that his or her parents have. There is not an indirect correlation between money and child rearing practices; however, wealth and income are the most significant defining factors as to which child-rearing practice will be used. ===Critical overview=== The techniques of child rearing that a parent uses when raising a child ultimately have a great effect on the child and how he or she develops. The difference between the two types presented by Annette Lareau is that concerted cultivation will in most cases provide a child with skills and advantages over natural growth children in the classroom and eventually in their careers. This is where parenting practices play into a larger social inequality issue. Social inequality results from a lack of educational and employment opportunities as well as the lower social status for the poor. This creates various difficulties for the poor and there are fewer opportunities to provide attentive care for their children. The natural growth parenting style arises under these disadvantaged circumstances. Natural growth is then perpetuated because these children will not be as well suited for the work force, and therefore, will make less money, and will most likely not be able to give their children a concerted cultivation upbringing. The critical issue is the difference in opportunities. Children of concerted cultivation, along with their upbringing, are typically provided with connections from their parents, friends, and activities that give them a step up in life. These advantages are perpetuated and inequality continues to exist. ===Natural growth=== Parents in the working class (and typically with lower incomes) engage their children in the accomplishment of natural growth. Children usually have more unstructured time and therefore create their own activities to occupy themselves. This environment does not prepare children to survive in settings that are very structured, such as schools. In working class households, the parents have less time to spend with children and do not have the money to hire help. Accompanying the strain on time, working-class parents are left with less time to get involved with their children's schooling and activities; therefore, they leave this up to the professionals. This approach is often not intentional. Rather, external factors like jobs with little flexibility in hours may cause difficulties scheduling meetings with teachers. Consequently, parents may feel frustrated and powerless, and children do not receive the sense of entitlement and support that comes with concerted cultivation. Having less time outside of jobs can also lead to less congruence between parents in their child-rearing practices. Having less consistency can cause the child to become more inhibited and reserved. However, natural growth is comparable to slow parenting, advocated by well- informed and financially stable parents who wish their children to be more independent and imaginative. ===Ethnic differences in parenting=== Though there is evidence that ethnicity is linked to class, in parenting, ethnicity has a much lesser impact on a child's development than social class. Social class, wealth, and income have a much more of an effect on what child rearing practices will be used, rather than the ethnicity of the parents or children. The correlation between ethnicity and social class comes from the perpetuated inequality in the distribution of wealth in the United States of America. The lack of money is the defining factor in the style of child rearing that is chosen, and minorities are more likely to have less wealth or assets available for use in their children's upbringing. Wealth and connections among middle- class parents also defines how these children enter the labor market, with or without help in finding jobs. ===Inequality=== Inequality exists in the opportunities that lead to different child-rearing practices but they also cause many other differences, such as the quality of schools, as a result of differences in wealth, income, and assets. The schools in the wealthier neighborhoods have more money to hire better teachers, staff, and materials that improve education. In addition to having better teaching and materials, the schools have more money to make renovations, have a better appearance, and the children develop a sense of confidence and entitlement because they feel that they are learning in an environment of excellence. The quality of the parents work life varies dramatically as well, and this plays into how much time and energy parents have to spend engaging their children. If inequality was not such a powerful force in America, resources, funds, and schools would be distributed more evenly. ==See also== * After-school activity * Educational inequality * Helicopter parent * Hidden curriculum * Mozart effect * Parenting * Slow parenting * Soccer mom * Socialization ==References== * The book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell in Chapter 4 discusses the concept of Concerted Cultivation. * Category:Child development Category:Parenting ","title":"Concerted cultivation"},{"id":"20387662","text":"is a Japanese film directed by Sh≈´suke Kaneko.

The Saints started out winning three of their first five games. However, the Saints would struggle as newly acquired quarterback Richard Todd threw 19 interceptions to just 11 touchdowns as the Saints again finished the season with a losing record at 7-9. Todd was acquired from the New York Jets for a first-round draft choice, and he beat out the aging Ken Stabler for the starting job at training camp, the Saints' last at Vero Beach, Florida. Stabler, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016, retired midway through the season. Late in the season, owner John Mecom Jr., who purchased the Saints as an expansion franchise for $8.5 million in late 1966, announced he would sell the team, with an asking price of $70 million. Fears abounded across Louisiana the team would be moved to Jacksonville if Mecom could not find a local buyer.

It was initiated by the automobile industry. The first VDA standard was for the exchange of surface models, and was named \\"VDA-FS\\". It has been superseded along the way, by a subset of the \\"Initial Graphics Exchange Specification\\" (IGES); referred to, simply, as \\"VDA\\". Aside from this exchange standard, VDA also developed \\"VDA-PS\\", a library standard for standard parts, now known as \\"DIN 66304\\". Based on ISO 9001:1994, the quality management system includes all elements of QS-9000, with an additional four requirements specific to VDA 6.1 as follows: * Element 06.3 on \\"Recognition of Product Risk\\": This the risk of the product, failing to fulfil its stipulated function, and its effect on the whole assembly. * Element Z1.5 on \\"Employee Satisfaction\\": This covers the perception of the company employees, as well as their needs and expectations, that will be met through the company's quality system. * Element 07.3 on \\"Quotation Structure\\": A customer or market is offered products for purchase or made available to own or to use. * Element 12.4 on \\"Quality History\\": This section covers the quality history of customer-supplied products and gives an overview of the situation during a particular period. The VDA standard is broken into two parts: * Management * Products and Processes. Any company seeking certification must achieve at least 90 percent compliance in a formal quality audit. Sanctioned interpretations of VDA 6.1 are available, clarifying some of the elements, so as to assist companies and registrars to understand the requirements better. There are also a number of other manuals, which must be read in conjunction with the VDA 6.1 manual, and is aimed at facilitating better understanding of what is required.

Set in San Francisco during the early 20th century, it tells the story of Daniel Lavette, a self described \\"roughneck\\" who rises from the ashes of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and becomes one of the most successful and dominating figures in San Francisco. The book hit number 5 on New York Times adult best seller list on November 6, 1977.http://www.hawes.com/1977/1977.htm ==Plot summary== Born on the voyage to America to his French father and Italian mother, Daniel Lavette grows up helping his father on a fishing boat. Tragedy strikes early one morning, however, when Dan wakes early to prepare the boat. The great San Francisco earthquake destroys vast swathes of the city including the small apartment where his parents where sleeping. Following a traumatic three days spent ferrying passengers across the bay to Oakland, he is taken in by friends of his father. The two immigrant families of Italian and Jewish origin use the money earned from the ferrying to start a financial empire and a bank, the Bank of Sonoma. Although Dan Lavette becomes quite rich, he does not stop. He wants to become multimillionaire and has many ideas in mind. He is an entrepreneur and seeks to find his place among the rich businessmen on Nob Hill. He asks for a loan from the larger Seldon Bank in San Francisco, but the owner declines it. During that meeting, Dan meets Jean, the exquisitely beautiful daughter of the owner, and both are smitten with each other. Soon after, they are married, against the will of Jean's mother, who looks down on immigrants and those of poor pedigree. Dan Lavette grows increasingly wealthy, but his happiness is short-lived. After they have two children, Jean ceases to love him and grows cold to his advances. Dan hired a Chinese bookkeeper, Feng Wo, to assist him at the start of his business dealings, but only receives an invitation for dinner at Wo's house after several years. Because Jean shares her mother's distaste for other ethnicities, Dan attends alone. At the dinner, Dan enjoys the company of Wo's daughter, May Ling, laughing and feeling more at ease than he had since his first days with Jean. After visiting her a few times at the library where she works, Dan falls in love with May Ling. They engage in an affair and they have a child together. So that she may have all of his energies to herself, May Ling wants him to divorce Jean. Dan broaches the idea to Jean, but is flatly declined as divorce is not something the Seldon family participates in. Even after she discovers the affair and has trysts of her own, she will not divorce him and holds onto the marriage as a ploy for leverage. The empire Dan started with his friend, Mark Levy, of his fishing boats and Levy's goods store, continues to grow. The Levy and Lavette Company (later L&L; Shipping) get into the business of shipping bulk cargo and profit from assisting the Allied cause during World War I. Sensing the end of the war, Dan convinces Mark to sell the cargo ships. Doing so before the cargo market collapses, the company greatly profits and uses the money to start to a classy department store. Adding to this, the pair diversify by adding luxury cruise liners and begin building a hotel on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. They also begin one of the first airlines of the west coast. Impressed with the raging stock market of the late 1920s, the duo issue shares to list their company on the exchange and begin playing the market on margin. This bubble bursts in the Crash of 1929 that begins the Great Depression. Many banks close, including The Bank of Sonoma, started by his lifelong Italian friend with the proceeds of the earthquake ferry service. Unable to honor his deposits due to the bank run, his friend dies of a heart attack. His Jewish compatriot and business partner, Levy, also dies soon after hearing of his daughter's death. Following this tragic news, Dan grows sullen. When May Ling gives him an ultimatum to divorce Jean or lose her and his son, Dan cannot act and May Ling moves to Los Angeles. As the heir to and subsequent chairwoman of the Seldon Bank, Jean calls the loans that are keeping Levy and Lavette afloat. Although Jean offers him a position as head of the remains of the company, Dan cannot accept her handout and refuses. Jean grants his request for a divorce and he signs away his share of their communal assets. Bereft of all his money and torn inside by the emotional destruction of his world, Dan wanders the streets as a vagabond in search of work and even spends three months in prison after fighting off some muggers. When a former employee and boat owner gives him a meal and a job, Dan returns to his first love as a fisherman. Having finally grown up, Dan rises from the depths of his humiliation to seek out May Ling. Venturing to Los Angeles, he meets May Ling and they are finally married. At the close of the story, Dan and Jean's daughter visits and begins rekindling a relationship with her father. ==Television adaptation== In 1978 the book was adapted as a four-hour, two-part miniseries, directed by Alan J. Levi, and starring Stephen Macht as Daniel Lavetta, Sharon Gless as Jean Seldon, and Aimee Eccles as May Ling. The cast also included Richard Anderson, Kevin Dobson, Roddy McDowall, Pernell Roberts, John Saxon, Susan Strasberg, Barry Sullivan, Ina Balin, Lloyd Bochner, Michael Durrell, Yuki Shimoda and Aharon Ipal√©.

First discussed at Western Washington University, the term Feeder Bluff is commonly used in the Puget Sound region of the United States. A bluff will be more susceptible to erosion if the sediment is unconsolidated, and more resistant in crystalline rocks, like granite. Rocks that are heavily fractured are also very likely to suffer from erosion because the water can flow between the cracks to speed up the process. A bluff will retreat towards land as the erosion processes continue. The term has not been extensively researched; specific criteria have not been developed to distinguish \\"feeder bluffs\\" from other types of bluffs; and quantities and rates of sediment supply to beaches and the littoral drift are unspecified and unknown.

The company also hosted websites for entities abroad, including the Qatari television station Al Jazeera, the Qatari newspaper al-Sharq, and Berzeit (Palestinian University of the West Bank). However, not only did InfoCom provide computer services to organizations and entities with terrorist ties; legal proceedings confirmed that the corporation laundered money on behalf of Hamas, transferred funds to its political leader and exported technology to Libya and Syria in violation of U.S. export control regulations that restrict or prohibit the export of technology, goods or software to countries listed as sponsors of terrorism.Levitt, M. (2008). Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. P.165. ==Terrorist ties== InfoCom Corporation achieved notoriety for its connections with terrorist organizations Al Qaeda and Hamas and with the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. In early 2001, the Dallas Morning News first started to publish stories about InfoCom‚Äôs suspected ties to Hamas, although the FBI had launched a criminal investigation in 1999. Evidence collected during a three-day raid of the offices of InfoCom Corporation beginning on September 5, 2001 conducted by the U.S. Joint Terrorist Task Force definitively confirmed InfoCom‚Äôs affiliation with terrorist organizations. ===Al Qaeda=== InfoCom attracted the attention of the U.S. authorities in 1998, when the name of an employee was found among the contact information listed in the address book of Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs former personal secretary, Wadih el-Hage, discovered by the FBI. The employee concerned, Ghassan Dahduli, ran the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), that had been co-founded by Ghassan Elashi.Kushner, Harvey V. (1998). The Future of Terrorism: Violence in the New Millenium. Sage. P.50. Both el-Hage and Dahduli lived in Tucson, Arizona, until 1990, when the latter moved to Richardson, Texas, with the IAP office. In 1998 both met again in Texas. The connection between el-Hage and Dahduli prompted the FBI to open an investigation that led to the Holy Land Foundation trials as well as to the terrorist designation of a number of affiliated entities. The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development was the largest Islamic charitable group present in the U.S. that was convicted of providing financial and material support to Hamas and shut down by U.S. authorities after being designated as a terrorist organization in December 2001. ===Hamas=== In his book Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad Matthew Levitt reported that InfoCom was actively involved in fundraising on behalf of Hamas ‚Äúbut also provided services to Hamas members, front organizations and supporters.‚Äù Ghassan Elashi, who served as InfoCom vice-president, was one of the founders and chairman of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. Ghassan was the founder of the Texas-based chapter of the Council on American Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group directly related to the Muslim Brotherhood in the U.S., and a co-founder of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. Ghassan was also one of the founders of the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), as association that has been accused of raising money for Hamas in the U.S. and which shares founding members and trustees with CAIR. Ghassan was also related by marriage to Mousa Abu Marzook, a Palestinian senior member of Hamas then serving as a political leader of the U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Marzook himself was listed as a Specially Designated Terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1995. Nonetheless, Marzook was a major investor in InfoCom, and the corporation engaged on a regular basis in financial dealings with both Abu Marzook and his wife Nadia Elashi. FBI criminal investigations ascertained that Abu Marzook invested $150,000 in InfoCom in 1992, while his wife invested $250,000 in 1993. Over the years, the former owners have been convicted of a multitude of charges involving funneling money to and doing business with terrorist organizations. The corporation, already defunct, was sentenced to two years probation\\"INFOCOM CORPORATION AND ITS OPERATORS SENTENCED IN FEDERAL COURT .\\" United States Department of Justice. October 13, 2006.

Other places included Haywards and Birchville. ==History== The electorate originated in 1954, and lasted to 1996, when with the introduction of MMP it was replaced by Rimutaka. In the , Upper Hutt had belonged to the electorate, and the National Party's incumbent Member of Parliament, Jimmy Maher had defeated the Labour' Party's candidate, Phil Holloway. In the , Upper Hutt belonged to the newly-formed Heretaunga electorate, and Holloway stood against National's Allan McCready (Maher's son-in-law) and won decisively. Up to 1990 when Peter McCardle won the seat for National, the Labour Party held Heretaunga. In 1993, McCardle narrowly held the seat against a challenge from Labour candidate Heather Simpson (who went on to become Helen Clark's Chief of Staff, known as H2 ‚Äì Clark was H1 ). Subsequently, McCardle left the National Party in 1996 and joined New Zealand First. ===Members of Parliament=== Key { class= - ! width=100  Election ! width=175 colspan=2  Winner -   rowspan=2  rowspan=2 Phil Holloway -  -   rowspan=7  rowspan=7 Ron Bailey -  -  -  -  -  -  -   rowspan=3  rowspan=3 Bill Jeffries -  -  -   style=\\"border- bottom:solid 0 grey; background:\\"  rowspan = 3  Peter McCardle -  rowspan = 2 height=36   style=\\"border-top:solid 0 grey; background:\\" -  bgcolor= -  colspan=3 align=center (Electorate abolished in 1996; see ) } ==Election results1993 election=1990 election=1987 election=1984 election=1981 election=1978 election=1975 election=1972 election=1969 election=1966 election=1963 election=1960 election=1957 election=1954 election=NotesReferences== * * * Category:Historical electorates of New Zealand Category:Politics of the Wellington Region Category:Upper Hutt Category:1954 establishments in New Zealand Category:1996 disestablishments in New Zealand ","title":"Heretaunga (New Zealand electorate)"},{"id":"20388291","text":"The Emoluments Clause may refer to the following clauses in the United States Constitution: * The Ineligibility Clause, Article I, Section 6, Clause 2, also called the Incompatibility Clause, affecting members of Congress * The Foreign Emoluments Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8, also called the Title of Nobility Clause, affecting the executive branch * The Domestic Emoluments Clause, Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, also called the Presidential Emoluments Clause, affecting the President's salary ","title":"Emoluments Clause"},{"id":"20388307","text":"Virgin Comics is a comic book publisher.

The core of the settlement, with the church, is known as V hribih 'in the hills'. Small farms belonging to the village lie on the slope and in the valley of Sovpat Creek.

The name of the village was recorded as Chribu around 1490, Walterskivrch in 1500, Balterskhiwurch in 1560, and Waltersskhiuorch in 1584. In the local dialect, the name has been reworked (via folk etymology) into Bajtarski Vrh (literally, 'tenant farmer's peak').

Gordon Lewis, one of the group's founders, defines a cult as a \\"religious group which claims authorization by Christ and the Bible, but neglects or distorts the gospel\\".Rhodes, Ron. The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions: The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2001. This quote is part of an excerpt form Gordon Lewis's book Confronting the Cults. EMNR aims to consolidate much of the scattered countercult movement and establish a standard for evangelizing to those movements they see as non- Christian or threatening to traditional Protestant Christianity. EMNR holds conferences about pertinent issues, publishes relevant materials, encourages networking between member groups, and makes recommendations of helpful agencies and materials that meet its standards.Our Purpose , from the ENMR website ==Organization== Eric Pement currently serves as EMNR‚Äôs Executive Director.emnr.org A full list of the organization's current members can be found here. ==HistoryFormation=== The countercult movement has long been divided over its goals and the tactics it should use to achieve those goals, which left the movement lacking cohesiveness. The participants in a 1982 Christian conference on cults and new religious movements voted to form a permanent anticult coalition, which they named Evangelical Ministries to Cultists. This coalition was coordinated by Gordon Lewis, a well-known figure within the countercult community. Other founders include Walter Martin, James Bjornstad, and Ronald Enroth.Cowan, Douglas E. Bearing False Witness? An Introduction to the Christian Countercult Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003. The group was designed to carry out the directives established by the 1974 Lausanne Covenant, a Christian manifesto adopted by the International Congress on World Evangelization that explains and promotes active global evangelism.Text of the Lausanne Covenant ===Name change=== In late 1984 the group's name was officially changed to Evangelical Ministries to New Religions, after the founders realized that the original name was likely to be seen as offensive to members of new religious movements. (The term \\"new religious movement\\" has for the most part replaced the word \\"cult\\" in academic spheres; \\"cult\\" still carries a largely negative connotation and is often seen as disparaging towards the members of emerging movements.) ===MEDS=== In 1997, EMNR's Committee on Ethics (which at the time consisted of Eric Pement and Craig Branch) drafted the Manual of Ethical and Doctrinal Standards (MEDS). This document, available here, spells out the guidelines for EMNR members' expected practices in evangelism. It represents a major step in bringing cohesion to the countercult movement through the clarification of doctrine and goals, the articulation of ethical standards of conduct, and the approval of countercult material. MEDS also represents an attempt to professionalize EMNR's sector of the countercult movement, a trend in the broader movement as well. Its warnings against falsifying credentials and embellishing pertinent stories demonstrate a desire for legitimacy and respect from serious parties on all sides. MEDS does not explicitly define the doctrine its members should express, but the Lausanne Covenant and its sibling document the Manila Manifesto of 1989 provide a basis for the expected religious beliefs and values of EMNR's members. These documents call for public faith, fervent evangelism, and firm belief in the absolute authority of the Old and New Testaments. ==Reactions== Although EMNR is meant to unify groups within the Christian countercult movement, it does not attempt to or claim to include all those that exist. The coalition's structured standards and emphasis on accountability deter some related groups from joining, even though submitting to the EMNR's authority is essentially voluntary. Tensions between groups also contribute to a less than uniform wave to join. On a broader level, there is no consensus within the Christian community as to whether evangelism is even the right approach to take for those opposed to new religious movements. Some analysts are critical of EMNR‚Äôs attitude toward the people it attempts to reach. Douglas Cowan, a sociologist of religion at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, points out the discrepancies between its demands for countercult activists to respect non-Christians and the loaded language with which it sometimes describes non-Christians. ==References== Category:Christian countercult organizations Category:Christian organizations established in 1982 ","title":"Evangelical Ministries to New Religions"},{"id":"20388492","text":"AsiaOne is a news, lifestyle and entertainment aggregator providing content primarily to readers in Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.

A clip of the Velvet Underground performing the song is played on completion of the Rock & Roll wonder in Civilization IV. In addition, the quote about researching the technology \\"Radio,\\" read by Leonard Nimoy, is \\"...then one fine morning she puts on a New York station.... You know, her life was saved by rock & roll.\\" The quote is credited to Lou Reed. Mitch Ryder's band Detroit, which featured Lou Reed's future guitarist Steve Hunter, performed one of the first cover versions of the song in 1971, changing the lyric \\"New York station\\" to \\"Detroit station\\". Other artists to cover the song include The RunawaysDiscogs - Secrets 1976 JapanDiscogs - You Drive Me Wild / Rock-N-Roll 1977 France, changing the aforementioned lyric to \\"L.A. station\\". The band Jane's Addiction, though also from Los Angeles, uses Reed's original \\"New York station\\" in its cover version of the song. ==References== Category:1970 songs Category:The Runaways songs Category:The Velvet Underground songs Category:Songs written by Lou Reed Category:Songs about music Category:Songs about radio ","title":"Rock &amp; Roll (The Velvet Underground song)"},{"id":"20388815","text":"The Albertirsa‚ÄìZakhidnoukrainska‚ÄìVinnytsia powerline is a power transmission line between Ukraine and Hungary. It is a part of the former \\"Mir\\" transmission system between the Soviet Union and Comecon countries. As of today, it is the only 750 kV-powerline in Hungary and one of the few powerlines operated with this voltage in the European Union. ==History== On 28 February 1974, the USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland and Czechoslovakia signed a cooperation agreement on construction of the 750 kV-line between Vinnytsia and Albertirsa, and substations Vinnytsia, Zakhidnoukrainska and Albertirsa. Construction started in 1975 and it went in service in 1979. Since the synchronization of the power grid of Hungary with that of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe (ENTSO-E) and because of economic reasons, the powerline went out of service in 1993, but was put in service again in 2002 after some new equipment was installed. ==Technical description== The long power line connects the substation of Albertirsa in Hungary with Zakhidnoukrainska substation, which is situated between Zhydachiv and Khodoriv in Ukraine. From there it runs further east to Vinnytsia substation, which is located in Vinnytsia Raion (southeast of the city of Vinnytsia). Portal pylons are used as suspension pylons. These are free-standing structures in areas, which are sometimes flooded and guyed ones in areas without flood-danger. As anchor pylons towers with one crossbar are used whereby the conductor is led around the pylon structure. The powerline was designed for the transmission of 2,000 MW electricity. ==See also== * Rzesz√≥w‚ÄìKhmelnytskyi powerline * Vetrino‚ÄìIsaccea‚ÄìYuzhnoukrainsk powerline ==References== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1979 Category:High-voltage transmission lines Category:Electric power infrastructure in Hungary Category:Electric power infrastructure in Ukraine Category:Vinnytsia Category:Hungary‚ÄìUkraine relations ","title":"Albertirsa‚ÄìZakhidnoukrainska‚ÄìVinnytsia powerline"},{"id":"20388847","text":"Ve≈°ter (; in older sources also Be≈°ter,Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906. Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 62. ) is a settlement in the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==Geography== Ve≈°ter is an old clustered village east of Trnje along the road from ≈†kofja Loka to ≈Ωelezniki. It stands on the left bank of the Selca Sora River with the settled area in the Ve≈°ter Plain (), and Pu≈°tal Hill and Cavrn Hill rise north of the settlement. ==Name== Ve≈°ter was attested in historical sources as Obernwester in 1291, Westreden in 1421, Westert in 1481, and Bestrad in 1500. The name Ve≈°ter is shortened from German Obernwester (literally, 'upper Ve≈°ter'). The neighboring village of Trnje was formerly called Wester, and so the epithet distinguished the two villages. The name Ve≈°ter is derived from the microtoponym Westerfeld ('western field', today Ve≈°trsko polje), which stands west of the cluster of villages around Stara Loka; the corresponding Osterfeld ('eastern field', now the northern part of ≈†kofja Loka) stood east of the built-up area, and there was also a Mittelfeld 'middle field' between the two. ==History== There is an unexcavated hillfort on Pu≈°tal Hill, testifying to prehistoric settlement in the area. In the 13th century, Ve≈°ter belonged to the Gadmar District (). During the Second World War, the Partisans used the Ve≈°ter Mill (Ve≈°trski mlin) south of the village, a structure attested since the 13th century, as an underground print shop. The building was burned by German forces on February 8, 1944, killing three Partisans. There is a memorial at the site. ===Mass graves=== Gorge Mass Grave Ve≈°ter is the site of three known mass graves from the period immediately after World War II. The Gorge Mass Grave () is located in the narrowest part of the Selca Sora Valley along the road from ≈†kofja Loka to ≈Ωelezniki, about east of the road. It contains the remains of six to 10 Home Guard soldiers and civilians that were released from the Loka Castle prison and then intercepted and murdered on their way home. The Lovrec House Mass Grave (), also known as the Matja≈æ Valley Mass Grave (), lies below the foot of Cavrn Hill, along a path about northwest of the village of Trnje. It contains the remains of eight Home Guard soldiers that were taken from the Loka Castle prison and murdered. The abandoned and dilapidated Lovrec House () stood at the site in 1945. The Cavrn Mass Grave () is located on the slope of Cavrn Hill near a former Partisan bunker. It contains the remains of eight Home Guard soldiers that were taken from the Loka Castle prison and murdered. ==References * *Ve≈°ter at Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka ","title":"Ve≈°ter"},{"id":"20388866","text":"Emily Mary Jane Ward, n√©e Lord (13 August 1850 ‚Äì 15 June 1930), was a pioneer of childcare education in England.

The tour was put on in support of the band's 1985 comeback album Done with Mirrors, released in November 1985. ==Background== This tour was the band's second tour after the reunion of the classic Aerosmith lineup in 1984. In August and September 1985, the band performed a few warm-up shows (mainly at outdoor venues in markets in which the band was strong) as a preview before their new album was released. Following the release of their comeback album, Done with Mirrors in November 1985, the band began the main tour in January 1986, where the band played arenas across America through August of that year. Ted Nugent was the opening act of most concerts of this leg. Some early dates of the tour featured Divinyls as the opening act. The tour was confined strictly to the United States, and was generally a success, with the band performing in many markets for two-night stands and even performing in large stadiums, such as Sullivan Stadium in their hometown Massachusetts. However, with the album only going gold and failing to meet commercial expectations, it was obvious that the band needed a big hit record and couldn't continue to rely on touring alone. Only months after the tour ended, the band experienced a resurgence in popularity with the successful remake of \\"Walk This Way\\" by Run-DMC featuring lead singer Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry. In the meantime, the band members entered drug rehabilitation and started working on their next album, the multi-platinum smash hit Permanent Vacation (1987). ==Setlist== # \\"Back in the Saddle\\" # \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\" # \\"Bone To Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)\\" # \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" # \\"My Fist Your Face\\" # \\"Last Child\\" # \\"No Suprize\\" # \\"She's On Fire\\" # \\"The Hop\\" # \\"Lightning Strikes\\" # \\"Shela\\" # \\"Walk This Way\\" # \\"Let the Music Do the Talking\\" # \\"Sweet Emotion\\" # \\"Toys in the Attic\\" # \\"Dream On\\" # \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" # \\"Rats in the Cellar\\" ==Tour dates== http://www.aeroforceone.com/index.cfm?pid=804189 {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=\\"200\\" Date ! width=\\"200\\" City ! width=\\"150\\" Country ! width=\\"300\\" Venue - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Preview tour -  August 23, 1985  East Troy  rowspan=\\"9\\" United States  Alpine Valley Music Theatre -  August 24, 1985  Clarkston  Pine Knob Music Theater -  August 25, 1985  Rochester  Silver Stadium -  August 27, 1985  Saratoga Springs  Saratoga Performing Arts Center -  September 2, 1985  Chandler  Compton Terrace -  September 14, 1985  Lynn  Manning Bowl -  September 22, 1985  Honolulu  Aloha Stadium -  November 6, 1985  rowspan=\\"2\\"Boston  rowspan=\\"2\\"Orpheum Theatre -  November 7, 1985 - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Full tour -  January 16, 1986  Portland, Oregon  rowspan=\\"92\\" United States  Portland Memorial Coliseum -  January 17, 1986  Seattle  Seattle Center Coliseum -  January 19, 1986  Spokane  Spokane Coliseum -  January 20, 1986  Portland, Oregon Memorial Coliseum -  January 21, 1986  Medford  Jackson County Auditorium -  January 23, 1986  Reno  Lawlor Events Center -  January 24, 1986  Daly City  Cow Palace -  January 27, 1986  Fresno  Selland Arena -  January 28, 1986  rowspan=\\"2\\"Bakersfield  rowspan=\\"2\\"Bakersfield Centennial Garden -  January 29, 1986 -  January 30, 1986  Las Vegas  Thomas & Mack Center -  January 31, 1986  Los Angeles  Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena -  February 1, 1986  San Bernardino  Orange Pavilion -  February 3, 1986  Albuquerque  Tingley Coliseum -  February 5, 1986  El Paso  El Paso County Coliseum -  February 6, 1986  Lubbock  Lubbock Municipal Coliseum -  February 8, 1986  Lafayette  Cajundome - February 9, 1986 Austin Frank Erwin Center -  February 11, 1986  Corpus Christi  Memorial Coliseum -  February 12, 1986  San Antonio  Freeman Coliseum -  February 14, 1986  Odessa  Ector County Coliseum -  February 15, 1986  Oklahoma City  Myriad Convention Center -  February 16, 1986  Amarillo  Amarillo Civic Center -  February 18, 1986  Beaumont  Beaumont Civic Center -  February 20, 1986  Dallas  Reunion Arena -  February 21, 1986  Houston  The Summit -  March 7, 1986  Landover  Capital Centre -  March 8, 1986  Philadelphia  Spectrum -  March 11, 1986  rowspan=\\"2\\" Worcester  rowspan=\\"2\\"Worcester Centrum -  March 12, 1986 -  March 14, 1986  Salisbury  Wicomico Youth and Civic Center -  March 15, 1986  New Haven  New Haven Coliseum -  March 16, 1986  Springfield  Springfield Civic Center -  March 18, 1986  Providence  Providence Civic Center -  March 19, 1986  Syracuse  Onondaga War Memorial -  March 20, 1986  Pittsburgh  Civic Arena -  March 22, 1986  Norfolk  Norfolk Scope -  March 23, 1986  Richmond  Richmond Coliseum -  March 25, 1986  Atlanta  Omni Coliseum -  March 26, 1986  Lakeland  Lakeland Civic Center -  March 28, 1986  Pembroke Pines  Hollywood Sportatorium -  March 29, 1986  North Fort Myers  Lee County Civic Center -  March 30, 1986  Jacksonville  Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum -  April 1, 1986  Nashville  Nashville Municipal Auditorium -  April 2, 1986  Knoxville  Knoxville Civic Coliseum -  April 3, 1986  Johnson City  Freedom Hall Civic Center -  April 4, 1986  Charlotte  Charlotte Coliseum -  April 5, 1986  Glens Falls  Glens Falls Civic Center -  April 8, 1986  New York City  Madison Square Garden -  April 10, 1986  Hershey  Hersheypark Arena -  April 12, 1986  East Rutherford  Meadowlands Arena -  April 13, 1986  Bethlehem  Stabler Arena -  April 15, 1986  Glens Falls Glens Falls Civic Center -  April 16, 1986  Portland, Maine  Cumberland County Civic Center -  April 20, 1986  Fort Worth  Tarrant County Convention Center -  April 23, 1986  Corpus Christi Memorial Coliseum -  April 24, 1986  San Antonio  Freeman Coliseum -  May 1, 1986  Binghamton  Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena -  May 2, 1986  Erie  Louis J.

It is a combined modeling, compilation and interface to the TOMLAB solvers. The matrix derivative of a matrix function is a fourth rank tensor - that is, a matrix each of whose entries is a matrix. Rather than using four-dimensional matrices to represent this, TomSym continues to work in two dimensions. This makes it possible to take advantage of the very efficient handling of sparse matrices in Matlab, which is not available for higher-dimensional matrices. TomSym has a variety of functions, among them: * Ability to transform expressions and generate analytical first and second order derivatives, including sparsity patterns. * Interfaced and compatible with MAD, i.e. MAD can be used when symbolic modeling is not suitable. * Numerical differentiation can be used to parts of the model. * Functionality for plotting and computing a variety of information for the solution to the problem. * Support for if, then, else statements. * Ability to analyze p-coded Matlab files. * Automated code simplification for generated models, for example. ** Multiplication by 1 or the identity matrix is eliminated: 1*A = A ** Addition/subtraction of 0 is eliminated: 0+A = A ** All-same matrices are reduced to scalars: [3;3;3]+x = 3+x ** Scalars are moved to the left in addition/subtraction: A-y = -y+A ** Inverse operations cancel: sqrt(x)^2 = x == Modeling == The TomSym symbolic source transformation makes it possible to define any the set of decision variables (both continuous and integer) and any type of constraint as well as scalars and constant parameters. === Linear programming === An example linear programming problem would look like this: c = [-7; -5]; A = [ 1 2 4 1 ]; b_U = [ 6; 12 ]; x_L = [ 0; 0 ]; toms 2x1 x solution = ezsolve(c'*x, {A*x<=b_U, x_L<=x}); === Mixed- integer nonlinear programming === A MINLP problem is defined just like a linear programming problem. This example also shows how to convert the model into a general TOMLAB problem. Name='minlp1Demo - Kocis/Grossman.'; toms 2x1 x toms 3x1 integer y objective = [2 3 1.5 2 -0.5]*[x;y]; constraints = { ... x(1) >= 0, ... x(2) >= 1e-8, ... x <= 1e8, ... 0 <= y <=1, ...

The following example creates a variable 'flow' with four indices. The variable is then used to create a constraint over two of the indices and to sum the multiplication with a two-dimensional matrix. % Create the indices used in model i = tomArrayIdx('i',1:6); j = tomArrayIdx('j',1:6); k = tomArrayIdx('k',1:6); l = tomArrayIdx('l',1:6); % Create an integer variable of full length flow = tom('flow',6^4,1,'int'); % Convert the variable to a matrix with four indices. flow = tomArray(flow,[6,6,6,6]); % Create a constraint valid for all i and j cons = {sum(sum(flow(i,j,k,l),k),l) == 1}; % Create a scalar based on multi-index multiplications distance = tomArray([ 0 945 605 4667 4749 4394;... 945 0 866 3726 3806 3448;... 605 866 0 4471 4541 4152;... 4667 3726 4471 0 109 415;... 4749 3806 4541 109 0 431;... 4394 3448 4152 415 431 0]); sumtotal = sum(vec((distance(i,k)+distance(l,j)+... distance(k,l)*.8).*flow(i,j,k,l))); === Automatic and numerical differentiation === For functions that cannot be interpreted by tomSym it is possible to use either automatic differentiation or numerical differentiation.

She helped to found a Domestic Workers' Union in Harlem in 1934.\\"The Domestic Workers Union\\", National Women's History Museum.Teresa L. Amott, Julie A. Matthaei, Race, Gender, and Work: A Multi-cultural Economic History of Women in the United States, South End Press, 1996, p. 171. The Domestic Workers' Union was started by a group of Finns and a few African Americans in California, who saw the necessity for a fight against the exploitation of Negro domestics. == Purpose of a union in the early 1900s == Creating the Domestic Workers' Union was a step towards trying to erase domestic slavery. The Union members helped send out letters to the ministers of the African- American churches where these habitu√©s of the \\"slave mart\\" (African-American domestic workers) attended and urged them to impress upon these women the direct harm they do to themselves and others by going to these slave marts, and accepting the low wages that these heartless employers offer them. == Union in progress == Within the union, which was located in the heart of Yorkville, 241 East 84th Street, there was a huge bulletin board onto which various items were posted. There were numerous clippings from papers, pamphlets and periodicals pertaining to the domestic situation all over the country. There were also notices of Bills to be presented, Bills that had been presented and petitions to be signed by the members of the Union. This was done so that everyone could be up to date as to what was happening as a result of their efforts and see that what they were doing was worthwhile. == The result of this union == This domestic union led to other unions being created in other states and later it later became associated with the American Federation of Labor. Dora's action may have been seen as foolish and lacking in importance back in the early 1900s but her action and effort have helped many domestic workers to get at least the minimum wage and other benefits that they are entitled to in the same way as any other kind of worker. ==References * The Domestic Workers Union * Transcription of interview with Dora Lee Jones, February 1939.

Lawrance Collingwood. Classical Recordings Quarterly. Summer 2014, No 77, p39-44. Around 1903 he attended High Wycombe Royal Grammar School.'The Wycombiensian', September 1957, page 360 - the school magazine of the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe: \\"D.J. Watson (1903-09)... wondered whether he was the Lance Collingwood who was at the R.G.S. when Watson entered in 1903. It was the same person... L.A. Collingwood, a Westminster Abbey choirboy, was sent to the school by Sir Frederick Bridge, the Abbey organist and a brother- in-law of Mr. G.J. Peachell, then headmaster of the school.\\" Lance was perhaps his school nickname. Appointed organist at St Thomas's Hospital and then at All Saints, Gospel Oak, he studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Exeter College (1907‚Äì1911), where he was organ scholar. In the autumn of 1911 he went to Russia and enrolled at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory where he studied under Alexander Glazunov, Maximilian Steinberg and Nikolai Tcherepnin. After graduating Collingwood returned to England in 1918 to begin military service but went back to Russia and worked for some years as assistant conductor to Albert Coates at the Saint Petersburg Opera. He also conducted at the Mariinsky Theatre. He also served as interpreter for Winston Churchill's expedition in support of White Russian forces in Northern Russia (1918-1919). His two piano sonatas, which show the influence of Alexander Scriabin, were published in Saint Petersburg. In England, he built his reputation at first as a composer: his Symphonic Poem (1918) was presented by the Royal College of Music; he himself conducted its professional premiere at the Queen's Hall in 1922, and the work was published as the result of a Carnegie Award. The first modern performance and recording was broadcast on 24 October 1995, played by the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Barry Wordsworth. In 1920 Lilian Baylis appointed Collingwood as the chorus master for her opera company at the Old Vic in London. Despite the poor conditions he preserved and made a significant contribution to the improved musical standards at the company. He conducted opera at the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells Theatre, becoming principal conductor at Sadler's Wells in 1931. His steady hand did much to establish Sadler's Wells as a viable alternative to Covent Garden. He gave early British performances of operas by Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. His own first opera, Macbeth, was presented there under his own direction on 12 April 1934, with Joan Cross singing Lady Macbeth. Music from the opera had already been played in the Queen's Hall on 10 November 1927 and it would be revived in Hammersmith in 1970. A recording of excerpts from Collingwood conducting Lohengrin during his Sadler's Wells years survives, with Henry Wendon in the title role, plus Joan Cross and Constance Willis, offering an example his work at the time. In January 1934, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a recording of the Triumphal March from Caractacus and the Woodland Interlude by Sir Edward Elgar, supervised by the composer himself by telephone from his sickbed before his death a month later.Jerrold Northrop Moore Edward Elgar: A Creative Life: pp. 821-22 Collingwood made his debut at the Royal Opera House in December 1936 with Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel. He conducted Sadler's Wells Opera around the UK during the Second World War in stressful and primitive conditions, and retired from the company in 1946. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1948. Although most of his professional life was spent in Britain, Collingwood travelled to Berlin to supervise recordings by Menuhin and Furtw√§ngler, and to oversee the 1956 Meistersinger conducted by Kempe. In 1950 and the following year he played a key role in recordings involving Casals, first in Prades then in Perpignan. His second opera, The Death of Tintagiles, set to Alfred Sutro's translation of Maurice Maeterlinck's drama, was premiered on 16 April 1950. His other compositions include a piano concerto and a piano quartet. Lawrance Collingwood brought many foreign operas to the British stage for the first time. His premieres as a conductor included: * on 30 September 1935 at Sadler's Wells, the first performance outside Russia of either of Modest Mussorgsky's two original versions of Boris Godunov. It was sung to an English translation by M. D. CalvocoressiGrove's Dictionary, 5th ed.: Boris Godunov * on 9 April 1946, the first professional performance of Ralph Vaughan Williams' opera Sir John in Love. Nikolai Medtner dedicated his song The Raven to Lawrance Collingwood. Collingwood died in Killin, Perthshire, Scotland on 19 December 1982, aged 95. ==Record producer== Concurrently with his conducting activity Collingwood worked in the recording industry; from 1926 to 1957 he was a musical supervisor for the Gramophone Company (later EMI) and was Musical Advisor from 1938 to 1972. He remained a freelance, retained for a certain number of sessions per week for which he was sent plans each week. From the 1920s he supervised nearly all Elgar's recordings for HMV and was also given the task of providing electrical orchestral accompaniments to go with acoustic recordings by Caruso and Tetrazzini. He worked as a record producer from the days of Fred Gaisberg, and was later a colleague of Walter Legge. He was EMI's producer of Sir Thomas Beecham's recordings of the music of Frederick Delius from 1946 onwards. He also produced recordings conducted by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Herbert von Karajan, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's recording of Gustav Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (under Furtw√§ngler), Kindertotenlieder and songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn. He produced Vittorio Gui's recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. ==Recordings== He recorded for HMV from 1922 until 1971. His recordings include: * Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in G minor, with Mischa Elman and the New Philharmonia Orchestra * Bach Violin Concertos with Mischa Elman * orchestral accompaniments for some of the most famous singers of the time: Enrico Caruso, Marian Anderson, Beniamino Gigli, Friedrich Schorr, Feodor Chaliapin, Lauritz Melchior, Elisabeth Schumann, John McCormack, Walter Widdop, Joseph Hislop, Elsie Suddaby, Norman Walker, Joan Hammond, Maria Caniglia, Peter Dawson, Florence Austral, G√∂ta Ljungberg, Fernand Ansseau, Sena Jurinac, Rita Gorr, Otakar Kraus, Webster Booth, and Sir Keith Falkner * Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24 K. 491 with Edwin Fischer and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1937 originally issued on eight HMV/Victor 78 sides and subsequently transferred LP and finally to EMI CD. * 90 Motives from Wagner's Ring Cycle * Excerpts from Act III of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde * Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi's Variations on a Nursery Tune, Op. 25, with the London Symphony Orchestra and the composer at the piano * Lighter music of Elgar (1964): includes Chanson de Matin, Minuet from Beau Brummel, Salut d'amour, Dream Children, Organ Grinder's songs from The Starlight Express, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. * Other miscellaneous orchestral works include Glinka's 'Jota aragonesa' (Philharmonia Orchestra, 1948), Thomas Overture to Raymond (Philharmonia Orchestra, 1948), Dvorak Carnival Overture, op. 92 (Philharmonia Orchestra, 1953), Borodin \\"In the steppes of central Asia\\" (Philharmonia Orchestra, 1953), Gliere The Red poppy - Russian Sailor's Dance (1953), Schumann Overture, Scherzo and Finale, op. 52 (London Symphony Orchestra, 1953), Grieg 'Two elegiac melodies, op. 34, no. 2 - The last spring' (London Symphony Orchestra, 1957), Elgar Serenade in E minor, op. 20 (London Symphony Orchestra, 1953), Smetana, Overture Prodan√° Nevest√° (The Bartered Bride) (Sadler's Wells Orchestra, 1946), Beethoven Egmont overture, op. 84 (London Symphony Orchestra, 1953), Wagner Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg - Prelude to Act I (Westminster Symphony Orchestra, 1953). ==ReferencesSources== * Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed.

The church was established in 1849 in the Black Rock section of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and moved to its current site in 1968. Approximately 4000 adults and children attend the church's four weekend services. ==History== In the late 1840s, a group of villagers of the Black Rock section of Fairfield, Connecticut, (later to become a part of the city of Bridgeport) parishioners of the First Church of Christ in Fairfield, Connecticut, decided that they would build a new meeting house in Black Rock, rather than continue the challenging three-mile weekly trip across the creek and marshland that separated the two sections of the town. A new church was established, and its meeting house was dedicated in August 1849 at the corner of Ellsworth St. and Bartram Ave. The original church building in Black Rock, with Woodruff Hall in the rear of the building. William Jessup Jennings served as the church's first minister. The church grew modestly through the middle of 19th century under the leadership of ministers Rev. Marinus Willett, Abram D. Baldwin, Rev. Frederick W. Williams, and Rev. Howard W. Pope. In 1881, the Rev. Henry Collins Woodruff accepted the pastorate of the church and served for 41 years, until his death in 1922. During Woodruff's tenure, a chapel was built, and upon his death, a memorial hall named for him was donated by his wife, Mary Bartram Woodruff. The church's next pastor was Rev. Charles Haddon Spurgeon MacDowell, who introduced a new evangelical direction for the church, encouraging Bible study groups and attendance at Bible conferences and camps. MacDowell served for 21 years. In 1945, the church severed ties to the formal Congregational denomination, making Black Rock a free and independent community of believers. During this time, the church was served briefly by Reverend Leonard S. Pitcher, Dr. Howard Z. Cleveland, and Interim Pastor Reverend Harry L. Cox, who was the first missionary that the church had supported. It was also during this time the church's steeple was blown off, crashing into the roof during a strong hurricane. Dr. Stanley R. Allaby In 1956, Dr. Stanley R. Allaby became pastor and began a 41-year tenure, under which the church experienced extensive growth. The church's missions program was developed further, supporting a number of missionaries financially and prayerfully with great concern. The missions program was highlighted each year with its annual Missions Conference, beginning in 1958 and continuing to this day. It was during this time the church's attendance began to increase. As the church grew in number under the leadership of Pastor Allaby, the original church building became increasingly inadequate in size. Multiple plans for building a new church facility in Black Rock were formulated and later rejected. The church then turned to the town of Fairfield, where a six-acre piece of property was purchased adjacent to Black Rock Turnpike. The church broke ground for a new facility in 1967, and the building was dedicated the following year. The facility was later expanded and renovated as the church continued to grow into the 1980s and 90s. Under Pastor Allaby, the church's membership grew to over 800 people. The second church facility on Black Rock Turnpike. Dr. Stephen A. Treash Dr. Stephen A. Treash, Associate Pastor under Pastor Allaby, accepted the senior pastorate in 1997, and is the church's current pastor. Under Pastor Treash's leadership, the church expanded the number of services to reach out to those in the community who may not normally be drawn to a traditional church, particularly young adults. The church retains a traditional worship service, but also offers services of contemporary worship and a special \\"next generation\\" format service called \\"Sanctuary.\\" In the early 21st century, the church again found itself having outgrown its existing church facility. The church elders instituted the \\"Ministry Expansion Program,\\" which sought a number of solutions to the problem. Additional services were again added, and the church was given the facilities of the Long Ridge Congregational Church in Stamford, Connecticut, where a temporary satellite campus was established in 2007. The expansion team formulated extensive plans to replace the current facility on the same site in Fairfield, which were denied upon submission by the town of Fairfield's Conservation Commission due to concerns over environmental impact. After the denial, new plans were drawn up with a reduced size building which would be situated exactly where the existing church is located in order to minimize environmental impact. The church received final approvals for these new plans in 2011 and broke ground in October 2012. After a 20-month construction period, the church dedicated its third building on June 15, 2014. After opening, the new facility became host to widely known Christian recording artists such as Lincoln Brewster, Jeremy Camp, Rend Collective, Kutless, Bethel Music, Stephen Curtis Chapman and Seattle-based pastor, Judah Smith. In 2016, the church's members voted to change the church's public name to, \\"Black Rock Church,\\" deleting the word, \\"Congregational,\\" to avoid any perceptions of association with other local Congregational churches. The full, historical name will be retained officially in the church's constitution and bylaws. ==References== * * ==External links== *Official site Category:Churches in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Fairfield, Connecticut ","title":"Black Rock Congregational Church"},{"id":"20389020","text":"Vincarje () is a settlement in the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==Geology== There are many sinkholes in the area, including the Bear Valley Sinkhole (), Gips Cave (), Mary's Shaft (), and Migut Shaft () near the Grebenar farm.

Given this perspective, the rest of the introduction identifies different strands of concepts that inform and support the evolution of engineering informatics as a distinct discipline that lives at the interface between engineering and informatics, in the same vein as bioinformatics, geoinformatics, medical informatics, and other applied disciplines. ==Engineering Informatics as a discipline of field study== Computer-aided design (CAD), intelligent CAD, engineering analysis, collaborative design support, computer-aided engineering, and product life- cycle management are some of the terms that have emerged over the past decades of computing in engineering. Codification and automation of engineering knowledge and methods have had major impact on engineering practice. The use of computers by engineers has consistently tracked advancements in computer and information sciences. Computing, algorithms, computational methods, and engineering have increasingly intertwined themselves as developments in theory and practice in both disciplines influence each other. Therefore, it is now time to begin using the term ‚Äúengineering informatics‚Äù to cover the science of the information that flows through these processes. Informatics, with origins in the German word \\"Informatik\\" referring to automated information processing, has evolved to its current broad definition. The rise of the term informatics can be attributed to the breadth of disciplines that are now accepted and envisioned as contributing to the field of computing and information sciences. A common definition of informatics adopted by many departments/schools of informatics comes from the University of Edinburgh: \\"the study of the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems that store, process and communicate information.‚Äù Informatics includes the science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems. The history of engineering and computers shows a trend of increasing sophistication in the type of engineering problems being solved. Early CAD was primarily geometry driven (using mathematics and computer science). Then came the engineering use of AI, driven by theories of cognitive science and computational models of cognition (logic and pattern based). More recently, models of collaboration and representation and acquisition of collective knowledge have been introduced, driven by fields of social sciences (ethnography, sociology of work) and philosophy. Information technology and sciences to have both created the need for, and play a role in, facilitating the management of complex sociotechnical processes. Information is context specific and its engineering is an integral part of any exchange among people and machines. Thus, informatics is the process of: # creating and codifying the linguistic worlds (representational structures) represented by the object worlds in the relevant domain, and # managing the attendant meanings through their contexts of use and accumulation through synthesis and classification. Engineering informatics is a reflective task beyond the software/hardware that supports engineering; it is a cross-disciplinary perspective on the nature of collective intellectual work. It thereby becomes critical that a consciousness of the use of languages and their implications in the storage and retrieval of information in a work community be addressed as part of any information engineering task. The role informatics plays in engineering products and services has become significant in the past decades. Most of the development has happened in an ad hoc manner, as can be expected. Techniques appeared in computer science and in programming practice; these techniques get used in engineering as is. Early computing in engineering was limited due to the capacities of computers. Computational power and telecommunications systems have started to converge, resulting in the possibilities of untethered connections and exchange of information that was just a distant dream in the early computing days. These developments have made the problems of distance less onerous and allow for global design, manufacturing, and supply chains. However, the problem of managing a global supply chain still is a daunting task with numerous incompatibilities in information exchange and coordination. The problem of integrating entire sets of industries in a flexible and ad hoc manner is still a dream especially for small-scale industries within the larger global environment. For this dream to become a reality, standards become critical. With technology evolving continuously, the task of creating information standards for varieties of exchanges from the syntactic to the semantic is a challenge yet to be resolved. Computer scientists or engineers by themselves cannot solve engineering informatics problems or the processes required to manage information in the context of engineered systems‚Äîit has to be a collaborative effort. The lack of skills among computer scientists in engineering and engineers in computing has led to problems bridging the disciplines. What pedagogical stance can help prepare students to deal with the complexities that are inherent in the task of engineering informatics? The culture of learning has to encourage the appreciation of diversity at the same time looking for the core essence and canonical nature of the experiences. While the products of today are increasingly designed for variety, we still have not mastered this process conceptually, let alone are we preparing our students. The fundamental characteristic of engineering informatics is that it is applicable at local levels of decision making in a design process as well as at the holistic level of product management and organizational design. Nowadays, people are entering an era of networks where different infrastructural networks can be connected through information networks. The information network can connect the manufacturing network to the design and supply chain network in almost real time using information systems that include sensors and ID tags. One‚Äôs imagination is the limit in this integrative power of information networks. It is this new complex world that we need to teach students, among other things, the ability to reflect on the information they use and how to handle this information, what it means to use (or not) computational tools, the need to create tools at different scales of inquiry and across disciplines, and how to view one‚Äôs own discipline from an engineering informatics point of view. ==Engineering technology areas== It encompasses engineering technology areas in: * Neural Network Engineering and Intelligent System Application * Decision Support System and Information Modelling System * Reverse Software Engineering and Reusable Software Engineering * The application of Cryptography in Computer Security System * Enterprise Architectural Framework and Application * Distributed Engineering and Business Services * Sensing, Monitoring, Control and Structural Dynamics * Human and Social Modelling for Design Simulations * Computational Engineering * Virtual Office and Optimization * Networking computing for Engineering * IT Applications in Engineering * Systems and Network Technologies * Interactive Media and Internet Development * Supply Chain and Logistics Management * etc. ==Universities and institutions offering Engineering Informatics== Engineering Informatics is a field of undergraduate study in some universities and polytechnics: ===Czech Republic=== * University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, Czech Republic * Tomas Bata University in Zl√≠n, Zl√≠n, Czech Republic ===Egypt=== *Information Technology Institute, Smart Village, 6th of October City, Egypt (Post-Graduate Diploma for Engineers) ===Germany=== * Otto-von- Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany * Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin, Berlin, Germany * Technische Universit√§t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany ===Georgia=== * Georgian Technical University, Tbilisi, Georgia ===Guatemala=== * Universidad Mesoamericana, Guatemala City, Guatemala ===Greece=== * University of Western Macedonia, Kozani, Greece * International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, Greece * Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia, Serres, Greece * Technological Educational Institute of West Macedonia, Kastoria, Greece ===Hungary=== * Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary * University of Pannonia - Faculty of Information Technology, Veszpr√©m, Hungary ===Indonesia=== *Pancasila University, Jakarta, Indonesia *University of Bunda Mulia, Jakarta, Indonesia ===Japan=== *Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan *University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan ===Lithuania=== *Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Vilnius, Lithuania === Portugal === https://www.dges.gov.pt/guias/indcurso.asp?curso=G005 https://www.dges.gov.pt/guias/indcurso.asp?curso=9119 * University of Madeira, Funchal, Portugal * University of Minho, Braga, Portugal * NOVA University Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal * ISCTE ‚Äì University Institute of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal * University of Algarve - Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Algarve, Portugal * University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal * University of Beira Interior, Covilh√£, Portugal * University of Coimbra - Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Coimbra, Portugal * University of √âvora - School of Sciences and Technology, √âvora, Portugal * University of Lisbon - Faculty of Sciences, Lisbon, Portugal * University of Tr√°s-os-Montes and Alto Douro - School of Sciences and Technology, Vila Real, Portugal * Instituto Polit√©cnico do Porto - Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Porto, Portugal ===Singapore=== *Nanyang Polytechnic, Ang Mo Kio, Singapore ===Taiwan=== * Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan ===United Kingdom=== * Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, North East England, United Kingdom * University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom * Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ===United States=== * Columbia University, Manhattan, New York City, United States * Harvard University, Manhattan, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States * Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States * Princeton University, New Jersey, United States * Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States * University of California, Berkeley, California, United States ===Venezuela=== *Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado, Barquisimeto, Venezuela *Andr√©s Bello Catholic University, Caracas, Venezuela *Alejandro de Humboldt University, Caracas, Venezuela *Universidad de Oriente, Anzo√°tegui, Venezuela *Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana, Ciudad Guayanahttp://www.uneg.edu.ve/htmls/?t&p;=portal.html *Universidad Nacional Experimental del T√°chira, San Crist√≥bal, Venezuela *Universidad Polit√©cnica Territorial de M√©rida, M√©rida, Venezuelahttp://www.uptm.edu.ve/ ==Publications== * Advanced Engineering Informatics is a journal publication in the field of engineering informatics. * The Need for a Science of Engineering Informatics.

Huggins's license to practice dentistry was revoked in 1996 after a panel found him guilty of gross negligence. Since then, he continued to publish on the topic of mercury and human health and believed that dental amalgam and other dental practices were responsible for a range of serious diseases. ==Life and career== Huggins received his DDS in 1962 from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. In 1973, he became involved in the study and research of mercury toxicity and its impact on human health. Through the course of these investigations, Huggins earned an MS from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs in 1989 with special emphasis in toxicology and immunology. Huggins subsequently became a prolific campaigner against the use of amalgam dental fillings, creating the Huggins Diagnostic Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At the Center, patients were charged up to $8,500 apiece for an intensive 2-week course of treatment including the removal of all amalgam fillings. Huggins claimed in his books that the Center's profits funded research and free care. The Center was closed in September 1995 after a series of lawsuits against Huggins alleging negligence and fraud. TIME reported that despite Huggins's difficulties, some patients continued to swear by his treatments; former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay had his fillings removed by Huggins in 1991 and reported resolution of an \\"unexplained numbness\\" as a result. Huggins received a series of warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for violating good manufacturing practices and marketing unapproved medical devices. In the mid-1980s, Huggins was investigated by the FDA for his marketing of the \\"Amalgameter\\", a device which claimed to detect \\"positively or negative charged dental fillings\\". The FDA found that the Amalgameter was a simple battery-powered ammeter, but was being promoted with a variety of scientifically unsubstantiated claims about dental fillings. The FDA reported in 1989 that Huggins had ceased manufacturing the device, but that \\"many could be around to dupe unsuspecting dental patients for a long, long time.\\" In 1996, a Colorado state judge recommended that Huggins's dental license be revoked, citing his use of \\"'deceptive yet seductive advertising' to trick chronically ill patients into thinking that the true cause of their illness was mercury.\\" Disciplinary proceedings regarding the license to practice dentistry in the state of Colorado of Hal A. Huggins http://www.casewatch.net/board/dent/huggins/alj.pdf  accessdate = 2015-01-23 Huggins's license was subsequently revoked by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners for gross negligence and the use of unnecessary and unproven procedures. TIME reported the judge's conclusion that Huggins \\"diagnosed 'mercury toxicity' in all his patients, including some without amalgam fillings.\\" Huggins contended that the revocation of his license was politically motivated in retaliation for his claims that amalgam fillings caused disease and claimed that he had not worked as a dentist since 1984. His criticisms of dental amalgam were featured on 60 Minutes.CBS's 60 Minutes, December 16, 1990. Huggins died on November 29, 2014 at the age of 77.Dr. Hal Huggins - Obituary - Legacy.com (Retrieved January 3, 2015) Finally, FDA began to admit the risk of amalgam on September 29, 2020. ==Research and beliefs== Huggins convened a conference on the biocompatibility of dental materials at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, with the assistance of a foundation called the Toxic Element Research Foundation that, according to Time magazine, is used by Huggins to promote his views. The participants unanimously signed a statement urging that amalgam fillings be banned immediately. Huggins has argued that amalgam can cause digestive problems such as Crohn's disease and ulcers, mood disorders such as depression and fatigue, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, scleroderma and lupus, high or low blood pressure, arthritis, tachycardia, mononucleosis, and cancers such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. In a paper published in Alternative Medicine Review in 1998, Huggins claimed that changes in cerebrospinal fluid that are typical for multiple sclerosis remitted after the removal of amalgam fillings and root canals. Huggins claimed that dental care according to his understanding of dentistry has allowed wheelchair-using patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to walk unassisted within weeks. These claims are inconsistent with mainstream scientific consensus on the causes of multiple sclerosis. A meta-analysis examined a range of studies on if there was a link between multiple sclerosis saw a slight increase in the risk of multiple sclerosis associated with amalgam use, but noted that this was not statistically significant. Another study found that although there was a geographical relationship between dental caries and multiple sclerosis, the use of dental amalgam was not associated with this disease. Huggins's criticisms of dental care were not limited to amalgam fillings; he was also opposed to root canals that he alleges can cause focal infections and illness, and has claimed that implants can cause autoimmune disease. According to a review article on mercury controversy published by Dr. Dodes in the Journal of the American Dental Association, it reports that Huggins \\"has attracted many followers, and his writings and media appearances have led some dentists to question the safety of amalgam restorations,\\" but the review nevertheless concluded that \\"There are numerous logical and methodological errors in the anti-amalgam literature. The author concludes that the evidence supporting the safety of amalgam restorations is compelling.\\" ==Environmentalism== Over the decades, an increasing number of dentists and doctors have come to agree with Huggins. Modern science has specifically associated amalgam fillings with a number of illnesses including dementia. The 2013 Minamata Convention on Mercury resulted in a number of measures intended to reduce mercury exposure, including the phasing out of amalgam in dentistry. Many countries had previously banned amalgam fillings in order to not only protect the public, but also the environment from the mercury contamination generated by dentistry. The actions of the Minamata Convention and the more environmental approach to health in the 21st century which include the missions of the Waterkeeper Alliance and other groups are consistent with Huggin's views. ==References *Dr. Huggins.com * *The court record of the disciplinary proceedings against Hal Huggins in 1995 (concluding statements on page 58) Category:American dentists Category:American lobbyists Category:American health activists Category:Year of birth missing Category:2014 deaths ","title":"Hal Huggins"},{"id":"20389310","text":"A184 may refer to: * A184 road (England), a road connecting Sunderland and Gateshead * HMNZS Endeavour (A-184), 1962 New Zealand Navy Patapsco-class gasoline tanker * A-184 torpedo, an Italian torpedo ","title":"A184"},{"id":"20389323","text":"Stirpnik () is a small settlement in the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==References *Stirpnik at Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka ","title":"Stirpnik"},{"id":"20389369","text":"Viscum cruciatum, commonly called the red-berry mistletoe, is a species of mistletoe in the family Santalaceae.

Because the subquery may be evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, it can be slow. Here is an example for a typical correlated subquery. In this example, the objective is to find all employees whose salary is above average for their department. SELECT employee_number, name FROM employees emp WHERE salary > ( SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = emp.department); In the above query the outer query is SELECT employee_number, name FROM employees emp WHERE salary > ... and the inner query (the correlated subquery) is SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = emp.department In the above nested query the inner query has to be re-executed for each employee. (A sufficiently smart implementation may cache the inner query's result on a department-by-department basis, but even in the best case the inner query must be executed once per department. See \\"Optimizing correlated subqueries\\" below.) Correlated subqueries may appear elsewhere besides the WHERE clause; for example, this query uses a correlated subquery in the SELECT clause to print the entire list of employees alongside the average salary for each employee's department. Again, because the subquery is correlated with a column of the outer query, it must be re- executed for each row of the result. SELECT employee_number, name, (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = emp.department) AS department_average FROM employees emp == Correlated subqueries in the FROM clause == It is generally meaningless to have a correlated subquery in the FROM clause because the table in the FROM clause is needed to evaluate the outer query, but the correlated subquery in the FROM clause can't be evaluated before the outer query is evaluated, causing a chicken-and-egg problem. Specifically, MariaDB lists this as a limitation in its documentation. However, in some database systems, it is allowed to use correlated subqueries while joining in the FROM clause, referencing the tables listed before the join using a specified keyword, producing a number of rows in the correlated subquery and joining it to the table on the left. For example, in PostgreSQL, adding the keyword LATERAL before the right-hand subquery, or in SQL Server, using the keyword CROSS APPLY or OUTER APPLY instead of JOIN achieves the effect. ==Optimizing correlated subqueries== The effect of correlated subqueries can in some cases be obtained using joins. For example, the queries above (which use inefficient correlated subqueries) may be rewritten as follows. \\\\-- This subquery is not correlated with the outer query, and is therefore \\\\-- executed only once, regardless of the number of employees. SELECT employees.employee_number, employees.name FROM employees INNER JOIN (SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS department_average FROM employees GROUP BY department) temp ON employees.department = temp.department WHERE employees.salary > temp.department_average; If the inner query is used in multiple queries, the inner query can be stored as a view, and then join the view: CREATE VIEW dept_avg AS SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS department_average FROM employees GROUP BY department; \\\\-- List employees making more than their department average. SELECT employees.employee_number, employees.name FROM employees INNER JOIN dept_avg ON employees.department = dept_avg.department WHERE employees.salary > dept_avg.department_average; \\\\-- List employees alongside their respective department averages. SELECT employees.employee_number, employees.name, dept_avg.department_average FROM employees INNER JOIN dept_avg ON employees.department = dept_avg.department; DROP VIEW dept_avg; You could also build and reference a temp table instead of a view. Another way to accomplish this, which would have the same performance as the \\"view\\" solution, is to use a CTE (Common Table Expression) as follows. This has the advantage of having the entire operation in one query in case that is a requirement. Note that some versions of SQL, typically older ones, do not support the \\"With...CTE\\" operation. WITH SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS department_average FROM employees GROUP BY department AS dept_avg_CTE -- arbitrary name, does not need \\"CTE\\" \\\\-- List employees making more than their department average. SELECT employees.employee_number, employees.name FROM employees INNER JOIN dept_avg_CTE ON employees.department = dept_avg_CTE.department WHERE employees.salary > dept_avg_CTE.department_average; Database implementations such as Oracle can automatically unnest a correlated subquery if the cost based optimizer deems this to yield a better execution plan. == External links == * Correlated subquery with examples Category:SQL ","title":"Correlated subquery"},{"id":"20389391","text":"Osaka Performance Doll a.k.a.

It was constructed by the Spar Aerospace, and is based on the HS-376 satellite bus. The Brasilsat A1 was off duty in March 2002 and was transferred to the graveyard orbit. ==Specifications== The satellite had the shape of a cylinder, where at its top was located a directional antenna that opened after the launching of the satellite. The satellite had a mass in orbit of 671 kg, had a rotation stabilized between 50 and 55 rpm, its propellers used as a propellant 136 kg of hydrazine and was powered by solar cells that supplied 982 Watts at the beginning of its phase of operation, using two NiCd batteries as power reserve. It carried 24 C-band transmitters with 6 spare transmitters. They provided an Effective Incident Radiated Power (EIRP) effective incident radiation power 34 dBW for most of the Brazilian territory. * Lead contractor: Spar Aerospace * Model used: HS-376 * Mass at launch: 1,195 kg * Mass in orbit: 671 kg * Diameter: 2.19 m * Height: 7.09 m when open * Stabilization: Rotation stabilized at 50 rpm * Power Star: 982 watts * Final Energy: 799 watts * Primary: 9 years (Extended: + 2 years) ==History== In the 1980s, Brazil needed its own satellites to exempt foreigners. As a result of this effort, the Brazilian company Embratel contracted in August 1982 the Canadian Spar Aerospace, in partnership with American Hughes, to build its series of satellites Brasilsat A, the series consisted of two satellites, the Brasilsat A1 and the Brasilsat A2. The Brasilsat A1 satellite was the first Brazilian satellite to give Brazil independence in satellite telecommunications services, through the former state-owned Embratel, now privatized. Before it, Embratel only rented third-party satellite transmitters. The satellite was launched on February 8, 1985, by an Ariane model rocket from the Kourou launch base in French Guiana and placed in a geostationary orbit over Brazilian territory. Two satellites were acquired from the company Spar Aerospace, model HS-376, manufactured under Hughes Space licenses. They cost about $125 million. The satellites initially received the name of Brasilsat 1 and 2 and formed the beginning of the Sistema Brasileiro de Telecomunica√ß√µes por Sat√©lite or SBTS (in English: Brazilian Telecommunications Satellite System). The satellite was stationed on the meridian 65 degrees west. Subsequent to the launch of the second generation of Brasilsat satellites, they were renamed Brasilsat A1 and A2. With the end of its life and already in an inclined orbit, the Brasilsat A1 was sold to HCI in October 1995. The antenna was redirected to North America. Control of the satellite was passed to PanAmSat on November 12, 1997. After the satellite was launched in February 1985, it was placed in the orbital position of 65 degrees west longitude. In 1994 it was transferred to 63 degrees west in inclined orbit, where it remained until the middle of June 1996, when it was moved to 79 degrees west in inclined orbit, where it remained until August 1998 in January 1999 it went to 144 degrees west in inclined orbit, the Brasilsat A1 remained in this position until March 2002 when it left of service and was sent to the graveyard orbit. Its replacement in the orbital position of 65 degrees west to continue with the telecommunications transmissions, was the satellite Brasilsat B2, that was released in 1995. ==Release== The satellite was successfully launched into space on February 8, 1985 at 23:22:00 UTC by means of an Ariane 3 vehicle launched from the Kourou Space Center in French Guiana along with the Arabsat-1A. It had a launch mass of . ===Capacity and coverage=== Brasilsat A1 was equipped with 24 transponders in C-band (plus 6 spare) to provide telecommunications services to Brazil. ==References * Embratel website Category:Communications satellites in geostationary orbit Category:Satellites using the HS-376 bus Category:First artificial satellite of a country Category:Star One satellites ","title":"Brasilsat-A1"},{"id":"20389606","text":"The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI; Hebrew: ◊î◊ï◊ï◊¢◊ì ◊î◊¶◊ô◊ë◊ï◊®◊ô ◊†◊í◊ì ◊¢◊ô◊†◊ï◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú) is an Israeli NGO established in 1990 that monitors the allegedly use of torture and ill-treatment by Israeli security services against Palestinians under detention. PCATI was founded in 1990 in reaction to what it describes as \\"the ongoing policy of the Israeli government, which permitted the systematic use of torture and ill treatment in Shin Bet interrogations\\". ==Approach == PCATI monitors detention centers and advocates against the use of torture in interrogation in Israel using legal means, supporting relevant legislation and an information campaign aimed at raising public awareness of the subject. PCATI cooperates with other human rights organizations, Israeli, Palestinian and international, in its struggle against the use of torture in Israel and for the implementation of international law and international humanitarian law in Israeli law and practice. PCATI is also engaged in outreach and education programs aimed at raising and engaging public discourse and consciousness regarding torture, impunity and related violations of human rights. In December 1996, PCATI, together with the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), Gaza, received the 1996 French Republic Award on Human Rights from the President of France.Palestinian Centre for Human Rights wins France‚Äôs highest award for Human Rights endeavours ==Operation== PCATI acts on behalf of all people‚ÄîIsraelis, Palestinians, labor immigrants and other foreigners residing in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories‚Äîwith the aim of protecting them from torture and ill- treatment by the Israeli security authorities. PCATI won a historic victory when, on 6 September 1999, in response to petitions of principle PCATI began submitting to the Israeli Supreme Court in 1991, and petitions filed together with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Hamoked‚ÄìCenter for the Defense of the Individual and others, the Supreme Court prohibited the use of various means of torture that were systematically employed by the Shin Bet until then. Following the decision, there was a significant decrease in the number of complaints regarding torture or the use of the harsh methods previously used. However, following the onset of the Second Intifada in September 2000, there was, again, a sharp increase in the number of complaints of torture and ill treatment indicating a reversion to the methods prohibited by the Supreme Court. This resulted from the exploitation of \\"necessity defense\\" opening allowed by the Court in its ruling, or by altogether denying the fact that physical force was used in interrogation, which victims would find difficult to challenge. There was also a widening of the phenomenon of the ill treatment of Palestinian detainees by soldiers and other members of the security forces. In light of this, PCATI expanded its activities and began employing field workers and external attorneys to assist the in-house staff in the investigation and treatment of cases of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (CIDT). PCATI has, in addition continued to search for additional ways to combat torture, CIDT and related violations of human rights and particularly the issue of impunity, and to develop its legal and public advocacy methodology. PCATI hopes in this way to influence policy makers, professionals and their associations, and the general public with the intent of converting such influence to pressure for policy change. In 2009, PCATI released a report titled \\"Shackling as a Form of Torture and Abuse\\" that accused Israel of torturing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners by shackling them in violation of international standards. The report also called into question Israel's refusal to allow the Red Cross to inspect Facility 1391, a secret prison which has been called Israel's \\"Guantanamo Bay\\". On 20 September 2016, NGO Monitor called out the inability of PCATI to base some of their allegations, such as the 2013 claim that Israel placed Palestinian children (and adults) in iron cages. Since then, several news networks circulated this claim, including The Independent and mondoweiss as well as social media platforms, such as Quora. ==See also== * Al-Haq * Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ==References *Official website Category:Human rights organizations based in Israel ","title":"Public Committee Against Torture in Israel"},{"id":"20389613","text":"Two ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Varne: * was a U-class submarine launched in 1943.

In 1902, changes to the country quota affected the three-member electorates in the four main centres. The tolerance between electorates was increased to ¬±1,250 so that the Representation Commissions (since 1896, there had been separate commissions for the North and South Islands) could take greater account of communities of interest. These changes proved very disruptive to existing boundaries, and six electorates were established for the first time, including Kaipara, and two electorates that previously existed were re-established. The electorate was rural and located north of Auckland city, in the North Auckland region. ==History== The electorate was created for the , and abolished in 1946. The first representative was the independent conservative Alfred Harding. In the , Harding stood for the breakaway New Liberal Party, but was beaten by John Stallworthy of the Liberal Party. In the , Stallworthy was beaten by Gordon Coates, who was Prime Minister from 1925 to 1928, and who held the electorate until he died in May 1943. As a (belated) wartime general election was to be held shortly, a by-election was postponed through the By-elections Postponement Act 1943, and Clifton Webb succeeded Coates at the general election in September 1943. When the Kaipara electorate was abolished in 1946, Webb successfully stood in the electorate. Kaipara was recreated in 1978, and again replaced by Rodney in 1996.

The federal government later created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroads, and eight of the nine sections (all but section 2) of Article X were repealed in 1969 as \\"deadwood\\". ==Sections== Section 1 gave companies the right to build railroads in Texas and to connect with others at the state line, and the responsibility to act as a common carrier, transporting passengers and freight \\"without delay or discrimination\\". Section 2 expands on the common-carrier provisions of section 1, and charges the legislature with passing laws to enforce this. It was amended in 1890 to allow the legislature to delegate this responsibility to an agency, leading to the creation of the Railroad Commission of Texas in 1891. Section 2 is the only one to be successfully amended, and the only one that was not repealed in 1969 (notwithstanding that the Surface Transportation Board has jurisdiction over all common-carrier railroads in the USA, even those physically located within only one state, and that the section has little force of law). Section 3 required every railroad operating in Texas to maintain an office in the state. Section 4 classified rolling stock as personal property. Section 5 prohibited the consolidation or common control of parallel railroads for anti-competitive purposes. The Southern Pacific Company was required to give up control of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway due to this section. Section 6 prohibited the consolidation of railroads organized in Texas with those organized outside the state. Section 7 required the consent of local authorities before a street railway can be chartered. Section 8 required pre-existing railroad companies to accept Article X in order to benefit from future legislation. Section 9 required any railroad that passes within of a county seat to pass through that seat if the citizens donated the right-of-way and land for a depot, unless topography prevented such a routing. ==Requirement for a Texas office== The legislature decided in 1853 that all railroads operating in Texas should be headquartered in the state, and that was included in the 1876 constitution as section 3 of Article X. When outside companies began acquiring control of Texas railroads in the 1880s, they were required to retain the Texas corporations. Since only Texas companies could operate in the state, the outside companies could not lease the Texas companies, as decided by the courts in an 1888 lawsuit brought by Attorney General James S. Hogg against the railroads controlled by Jay Gould (International and Great Northern Railroad, Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, and Texas and Pacific Railway, all leased to the Missouri Pacific Railroad). These separate Texas companies sometimes took the name of the parent, but often retained their original names. Systems that entered Texas and their local companies included: *Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway: Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway *Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway: Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway *Colorado and Southern Railway: Fort Worth and Denver City Railway *El Paso and Southwestern Company: El Paso and Southwestern Railroad of Texas *Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad: Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway of Texas *Kansas City Southern Railway: Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway *Louisiana Railway and Navigation Company: Louisiana Railway and Navigation Company of Texas *Louisiana and Arkansas Railway: Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas Railway *Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway: Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway of Texas *Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway: Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway of Texas *New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railroad: Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railway, St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway *St. Louis-San Francisco Railway: St. Louis, San Francisco and Texas Railway, Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway *St. Louis Southwestern Railway: St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas *Southern Pacific Company: Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, Houston East and West Texas Railway, Houston and Texas Central Railroad, Texas and New Orleans Railroad *Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway: Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway of Texas The Interstate Commerce Commission approved a lease of the Texarkana and Fort Smith to the Kansas City Southern in 1933.

Their first concert was on 10 May 1969, by Chris Simpson (guitar, vocals), Lyell Tranter (guitar, vocals), and Glen Stuart (vocals). The trio released albums for Fontana Records and Vertigo Records, enjoying particular success with 1970's Seasons. ==History== Times of Change (1969) was released by Fontana, before their 1970 album, Seasons, reached number 55 on the UK Albums Chart, although thereafter Tranter returned to Australia. In 1971, Magna Carta performed at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Davey Johnstone joined the line-up, recording Songs From Wasties Orchard (1971) and In Concert (1972) with the band, before leaving to work with Elton John, with whom he is still playing. Simpson and Stuart were then joined by Stan Gordon, recording and releasing Lord of the Ages (1974). Graham Smith who had played on the sessions for Lord of the Ages, was also added to the line-up but shortly afterwards both he and Gordon left. There followed a period of change as Simpson and Stuart added a new rhythm section. This short-lived set-up soon gave way to the main duo being joined by Tommy Hoy (ex-Natural Acoustic Band), before Stuart left to run a pet shop in Richmond, Surrey. Nigel Smith joined in time to help record 1975's Putting It Back Together. In 1977, Hoy's former bandmate in the Natural Acoustic Band, Robin Thyne joined the band, along with Lee Abbott. Soon afterwards, Pick Withers was added. Withers stayed only briefly, leaving to join Dire Straits. Amid much acrimony, Thyne and Hoy left in 1979 to form NovaKarta. Tom McConville appeared on the Live In Bergen release, before the line-up changed again to accommodate Al Fenn and George Norris. Between 1980 and 1982, Doug Morter was added to the line-up, together with a variety of drummers, including Paul Burgess. The 1981 release, Midnight Blue, contained \\"Highway To Spain\\". Norris, Burgess, and Morter all left, the latter moving on to the Albion Band. Chris Simpson's solo release, Listen To The Man, came out during this period and featured backing from Abbott, Linda Taylor, and Will Jackson. Between 1984 and 1986, Simpson and Taylor went to the Middle East to run a music club, before returning home to re-form Magna Carta. By 1986, the line-up now included, in addition to Simpson, Taylor, and Abbott; Gwyn Jones, John Carey, Paul Burgess, and Simon Carlton. In 1988, One To One was released on the Tembo label, Jones left the band the same year. In 1990, Simpson and Taylor married, and, with the semi-retirement of Lee Abbott, they continued to play as Magna Carta as a duo, as well as with a larger line-up for extensive touring. The 1992 Dutch release, Heartlands, was followed by a tour of the Netherlands. The duo continued to maintain a busy live schedule, and over the years toured over 60 different countries. Several live albums appeared over the course of the decade, in addition to the reissue of the band's 1970s albums on CD. In 2001, Seasons In The Tide was released on the Gold Circle label, although the label went bankrupt soon afterwards. In 2002, the DVD Ticket To The Moon was released, recorded at the Dutch island of Texel in 2001. Later that year, Magna Carta supported Fairport Convention on their Dutch theatre tour. At De Hanzehof theatre in Zutphen they saw a young violin player from the Netherlands, who had played on some songs with Fairport Convention. Afterwards they met the young man, Matt(hijs) Barnhoorn, and asked him to join them on one of their concerts. In 2002, Barnhoorn became a permanent member of Magna Carta. As well as violin he plays mandolin and guitar. Together they performed two tours of the Netherlands each year since, one spring tour (usually in music caf√©s, folk clubs, and small venues) and one autumn tour, mainly in theatres throughout the country. They also went on tour in South Africa and played in Canada, Switzerland, Spain, and Belgium. In 2006, Chris and Linda Simpson announced that their marriage was over. In 2007, Chris Simpson celebrated his 65th birthday. On 17 August travelled to Liverpool, ostensibly to take part in a radio interview with BBC Radio Merseyside presenter Spencer Leigh. However, it transpired that his wife had secretly arranged for Magna Carta to perform at the Cavern Club on Mathew Street. The Cavern concert turned into a celebration, and the band was joined by Lee Abbott on bass and Iain 'Stewy' Stewart on harmonica. At the end of the concert, Simpson was presented with one of the Cavern bricks with the band's name on it. This has since been mounted on the Wall of Fame, along with the names of all the acts ever to have played the venue, opposite The Cavern Club itself. In 2007, Magna Carta had already decided that they would disband in 2009, mainly in recognition of the deterioration of the Simpsons' relationship. In late 2008 they embarked upon a \\"farewell tour\\" of the Netherlands. On 11 May 2009, Chris and Linda Simpson, along with Matt Barnhoorn, played their last concert at Koninklijk Theater Carr√© in Amsterdam. The trio were joined by some ex-members of Magna Carta: Lee Abbott, Doug Morter, George Norris and Tom Hoy. Two Dutch musicians were also present: Mike Roelofs (keyboards) and Eddie C (percussion). Barnhoorn's father, Henny, played the bagpipes at the start of the second half of the concert. Dr. Andrew Jackson, doctor and part-time actor, was the narrator (as he was on the recording of \\"Fields of Eden\\" on the Backroads album). A tour featuring Simpson and Tom Hoy went ahead in South Africa in September 2009. Hoy has since stated that he has no intention of taking part in future tours and, as a result, a 2010 tour of South Africa took place with the line up of Chris Simpson and Nick Hall; they also performed in Spain, Canada and the Netherlands in 2011. In early 2011, Midnight Blue was released in a double album package with the live album Live & Let Live. In September and October 2011, a new Magna Carta line up toured around 17 venues in the Netherlands. George Norris returned on guitar and vocals and the latest addition was Dutch multi-instrumentalist Laurens Joensen [pronounced Jo-ansen]. Joensen played slide guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, violin. After another tour in the Netherlands, the band returned to the studio to record a new album, The Fields of Eden (2015).

During his studies he met Victor Loret, his Egyptology professor at the University of Lyon, and followed him in his devotion to Egyptian philology and archaeology. Varille began working in Egypt in 1931 together with his colleague Cl√©ment Robichon (1906-1999), and the following year, he was made a member of the Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale in Cairo. Gates to the temple of Medamud In 1939, he excavated the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the temple of Medamud, now in the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Lyon. He wrote his thesis in Egyptology on an important Egyptian functionary of the New Empire, Inscriptions concernant l'architecte Amenophis, fils de Hapou (published by Jean Vercouter. IFAO, 1968). In 1944, he was made taken on as an expert by the Service des Antiquit√©s Orientales. After having discovered during World War II the symbolic theory of the Group of Luxor, directed by R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1887-1961) who just settled in Egypt (since 1936, until 1952), Varille decided to invest his time in trying to provide the new opportunities offered by the Egyptian philosophy of symbols, also in the way to excavate in North Karnak since 1941 respecting new rules.

The species was first described by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1784 and it can be found in Europe. 200px The wingspan is , the females are a bit smaller. The colour of the wings varies from whitish to brown. The outer cross line on the front wings consists of dark points (often connected) and is well developed. The interior cross line is similar to the outer, but only weakly implied in some specimens. The discal stain stands out clearly. The dark outer cross line of the forewings continues in attenuated form on the hindwings. There are fine black dots on the margins of all wings. The species occurs mainly in north central Europe and eastwards to the Urals, predominantly in sandy heathland habitats. It has been found in open moorland, heathland and peat bogs in many areas in the north of England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland. It also has been found in the very south of England. The moths fly from June to July, or earlier, depending on the location. The larvae feed on heather (Calluna) and heath (Erica) species. ==External links== * (with photo) *Fauna Europaea *Lepiforum e.V.

The buildings were converted in 1989 into 150 loft-style residential apartments, a private leisure centre, and 19 commercial units. Port Dundas is an area of Glasgow, Scotland, located to the north of the city centre. It lies to the north of Cowcaddens, and to the west of Sighthill, with Hamiltonhill and Possilpark to the north-west. ==History== The Port Dundas terminus was established at One Hundred Acre Hill between 1786 and 1790 and was named after Sir Lawrence Dundas, one of the major backers of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. Port Dundas formed the terminus of a branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal in the centre of Glasgow, linking to the adjacent Monkland Canal. It became an industrial centre in the 19th century, with textile mills, chemical works, granaries, distilleries, glassworks, iron foundries, power stations and engineering works all operating in the area. In 1859, a brick chimney was built at Port Dundas for F. Townsend.

Charles Tennant's St.Rollox Chemical Works, at one time the largest chemical manufacturer in the world closed its plant to the east of Port Dundas in 1964. The M8 motorway was constructed immediately to the south, over the route of the Monkland Canal, in the 1970s, obstructing access to the canal basin. Early in the 21st century, the Forth and Clyde Canal was restored as a leisure attraction, and the canal and warehouses at Port Dundas were restored as apartments. ===Port Dundas Grain Distillery=== Diageo Port Dundas Grain Distillery. The area is the site of a former large Scotch Grain distillery, which produced 39 million litres of spirit each year on a site until being closed in 2010. Originally there were two distilleries in the locality, the first was established in 1811 by Daniel McFarlane. Two years later the second one was established by Brown, Gourlie & Co. During 1845 Coffey Stills for the manufacture of Grain whisky were installed in both distilleries. Both distilleries merged in the 1860s and later became part of the Distillers Company in 1877. They were destroyed by fire in 1903 but were rebuilt and reopened in 1913, and rebuilt again in 1916 after being severely damaged by another fire. The distillery was closed for the duration of World War II.

It was fought between British government forces and an alliance of Jacobites and Spaniards, and resulted in a victory for the British forces. It was the last close engagement of British and foreign troops on mainland British soil. The battle is sometimes considered an extension of the 1715 rising, but is more correctly a separate rebellion and was the only rising to be extinguished by a single military action.Michael Lynch, Oxford Companion to Scottish History, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 349, It is \\"Scotland's only battle site with contemporary remains still visible ‚Äì including the stone dyke enclosure where the Jacobite munitions were stored\\".National Trust for Scotland information on the battle Accessed 28 January 2009 Sg√πrr nan Sp√†inteach (middle background left) and S√†ileag (centre) from the east.

A barricade had been constructed across the road, and along the face of the hill on the north side of the river entrenchments had been thrown up.

Syrian troops had captured the IDF outpost on the mountain on October 6, and held it for two weeks. In the third battle, codenamed Operation Dessert (, Mivtza Kinu'ah), Israeli troops captured the Israeli outpost and the Syrian one. ==Background== After losing control of Mount Hermon on October 6 and failing to recapture it on October 8, the IDF, and the Golani Brigade in particular, grew determined to recapture it. Its loss levied a heavy toll on Israel's intelligence gathering during the war. At 10:15 PM on October 19, Israeli Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) David Elazar was on his way to the Israeli Northern Command to monitor an attack on the Hermon. At that time, the General Staff learned of the United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's notification of an immediate ceasefire to the war. Elazar was asked to return to Tel Aviv, where he met with the Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, and they agreed that recapturing the Hermon was top priority.Rabinovich (2005), p. 446 Yehuda Peled, who had commanded the failed counterattack on October 8, decided that it would be best to attack from the Syrian enclave to the east, instead of from the Golan again. The 4,000 foot climb from that direction was very steep, but would bring the attacking force straight to the Israeli outpost without fighting on the ridge. The Golani commander, Amir Drori, concurred. Peled's 51st battalion was therefore posted in an abandoned Syrian village at the foot of the eastern side of the Hermon. For three nights, the battalion practiced a quick climb with full gear, and Peled concluded that the mission was possible. Elazar ordered him to take the entire crest, including the Syrian Hermon. Golani was to capture the Israeli Hermon, while a reserve paratroopers brigade, under the command of Colonel Haim Nadel, would attack the Syrian positions established before the war.Rabinovich (2005), p. 446-447 ==Prelude== Nadel's officers suggested taking the crest and then moving down to the Israeli Hermon. Brigadier-General Yekutiel Adam, Deputy Chief of Northern Command, rejected this suggestion, saying Golani should capture the outpost it had lost. The paratroop officers suggested that Golani would attack from the east, but were rejected because the eastern slope was considered too vulnerable to Syrian artillery and too steep to safely evacuate the wounded. On the night of October 20, Drori arrived at Northern Command and was advised by a paratroop officer to change his orders. He refused.Rabinovich (2005), p. 447 For the two weeks before the Israeli attack, the Syrians were hiding by day, expecting an Israeli assault. Two Syrians were wounded by Israeli shelling during those two weeks.Rabinovich (2005), p. 448 On the morning of October 21, a reconnaissance team under the command of Yoni Netanyahu climbed an adjacent spur to look at the Israeli Hermon, and reported seeing only two Syrians on the ridge the entire day. Aerial photography also failed to show any indication of Syrian forces in the outpost. That evening, 400 Golani troops gathered in a grove at the foot of the western slope. Drori told them that the Hermon was highly important, being \\"the eyes and ears of the country\\".Rabinovich (2005), p. 447-448 ==BattleIsraeli Hermon=== Majdal Shams, with the slopes of Mount Hermon behind. The battalion moved to Majdal Shams, from where it began to ascend the mountain. The reconnaissance company moved far to the left. In the middle, a motorized force led by tanks and a bulldozer prepared to move up the road to follow the two flanks. These were accompanied by artillery, firing 200 yards ahead, but it was ordered to stop when it began to hit too close to the troops. After nine hours of climbing they were two thirds of the way up, when they were hit by heavy fire. Five of the six tank commanders in the motorized force were hit by Syrian commandos lying at the side of the road. The reconnaissance company was also hit and its commander was killed. The exchange of fire took place at range of a few yards. In addition to snipers, the Syrians also used Israeli machine guns taken from the outpost after the first battle.Rabinovich (2005), p. 448-449 Several times, the Israelis mistook Syrian fire for friendly one. Peled tried to outflank the Syrians. One of his company commanders took the wrong path and turned northwest instead of northeast. He reported no enemy in sight. Peled moved forward to get a better view. Drori ordered him back, but Peled ignored him. Drori was then hit, and wanted to pass command to Peled. Peled's artillery officer and radioman were both killed. He took the radio before being hit as well. At dawn artillery was called in, and the Syrian fire began to fade. Several Syrian snipers surrendered. At 11:00 AM, a Golani officer announced that the Hermon was in Israeli hands.Rabinovich (2005), p. 449-450 ===Syrian Hermon=== Nadel's force was airlifted to the crest by helicopters. Two battalions, totalling 606 soldiers, arrived in twenty-seven sorties. The helicopters moved through the wadis around the Syrian anti- aircraft positions, and artillery preceded the helicopters.Rabinovich (2005), p. 450 Syrian artillery from the nearby village Arneh shelled the landing zone and seriously wounded one Israeli. Twenty-one soldiers were also landed at the summit of Mount Hermon.Wallach (2003), p. 72 By 17:25, all the Israeli paratroopers had arrived. Seven men were placed on the peak to observe. The Syrians called for seven MiGs, but these were shot down by Israeli aircraft. Two Syrian helicopters carrying reinforcements were also shot down. A Syrian ground advance from Arneh was also halted by IAF planes. The Israeli paratroopers proceeded to attack the Twists Position (, Mutzav HaPitulim), defended by 25‚Äì30 Syrians. One Israeli platoon commander and seven Syrians were killed, and the rest retreated. The Twists Position overlooked both the Syrian Hermon Position and the road to Arneh, so roadblocks and ambushes were set up around it. Israeli forces continued south, attacking the Cliff Position (, Mutzav HaMatsuk), with 30‚Äì40 Syrian defenders. Thanks in part to artillery support, the Israelis captured the position without suffering any casualties, killing 12 Syrians. The ambush around the Twists Position intercepted six Syrian trucks with reinforcements, capturing or destroying five. At 03:00, they were overlooking the main Syrian observation post. Nadel called in artillery fire. Half an hour later, the Israeli troops attacked and discovered that the Syrian defenders had fled. At 06:00‚Äì10:00, one of the battalions moved toward the Israeli Hermon to assist the Golani troops. En route, it encountered Syrians who had escaped from the Israeli Hermon. The Israeli battalion killed some of them and took 17 others prisoner. One Israeli was killed in the shootout. The paratroopers were halfway down when they were ordered by the Northern Command to move back up.Rabinovich (2005), p. 450‚Äì451 ==Aftermath== Golani's casualties were fifty-five dead and 79 wounded. The paratroopers' casualties were one dead and four wounded.Rabinovich (2005), p. 451 After the battle, one Golani private repeated the phrase \\"the eyes of the country\\" in an interview for the Israeli television. It has since become a common idiom for the Hermon in Israel. The Israeli conduct later came under criticism. Historian Uri Milstein argued that the planning and execution of the attack was flawed and scandalous. Thirty years after the battle, Drori rejected claims that the paratroopers' assistance was unwanted because of Golani's prestige considerations, and said that by the time the paratroopers could have arrived, they were no longer needed. After the war, the Syrian Hermon was handed back to Syria. The remainder of Mt. Hermon continues to be under Israeli control. ==NotesReferences== * * *Operation Dessert (Mivtza Kinu'ah),Exhibition in the IDF&Defense; establishment archives Category:Battles of the Yom Kippur War ","title":"Third Battle of Mount Hermon"},{"id":"20390185","text":"Maidstone is an old southern Maryland plantation located in Owings, Calvert County, Maryland. The oldest extant part of the house was built in 1751 by a yeoman planter, Lewis Lewin on or near the site of an earlier wood structure., though a brick in one of the chimneys is dated 1678. ==The house== Maidstone was built as a Medieval style house with a roof progressing upwards, which extends out over the north and south facades of the house to form a porch in what many consider is traditional Maryland Colonial style. There are two outbuildings with old beams and rough-hewn horizontal siding. The grounds are well maintained, and there are stands of very old boxwood. ==Ownership== Maidstone Plantation was originally in Anne Arundel County in the Province of Maryland prior to boundary shift. It was owned by three generations of the Chew family over a span of more than 60 years, including Benjamin Chew (1671‚Äì1700), his son Samuel Chew (1693‚Äì1743) and grandson Benjamin Chew (1722‚Äì1810). In 1745, Maidstone was sold to an Anne Arundel County, Maryland farmer, Lewis Lewin. In 1755, Thomas Whittington and his wife Wilhelmina Powell purchased Maidstone with the proceeds from the sale of a portion of her inheritance, a plantation called Gory Banks. The couple built their \\"Dwelling house\\" and lived there until the death of each and Maidstone became the family dwelling home for three succeeding generations. By indenture dated April 9, 1783, Thomas Whittington http://aomol.net/000001/000728/html/am728--160.html purchased an additional 100 acres from Lewis Lewin's son, Samuel Lewin. The purchase included \\"Several Parts of Tracts or Parcells of Land following being part of Three Tracts of Land called and Known by the names of Halls Hills, Mackalls Hills and Maidstone.\\" Thomas Whittington's will, which was probated February 9, 1786, gave one half of his land containing Maidstone \\"where my Dwelling house stands\\" to his oldest son John. His second son, Thomas, received the other half of the land containing Gory Banks, while the third son, Benjamin, received 177 Pounds in lieu of land. In John Whittington's will, dated August 31, 1817, he stated that he had purchased the remainder of Maidstone from William Weems, Trustee for the real estate of Captain William Weems. Maidstone now contained three hundred and forty acres and was \\"the plantation upon which I now reside.\\" Following John Whittington's death, Maidstone became the property of his second wife, Elizabeth Scrivener Whittington. After her death, it became the property of John Whittington's daughter, Mary, who married Henry Childs on June 26, 1820. Therefore, Maidstone Plantation passed into the Childs family and was no longer the Whittington plantation. ==National Register of Historic Places== Maidstone was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. ==See also== * Tulip Hill ==References *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust * Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Houses in Calvert County, Maryland Category:Plantation houses in Maryland Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calvert County, Maryland ","title":"Maidstone (Owings, Maryland)"},{"id":"20390187","text":"Hubert Dainton 'Trilby' Freakes (2 February 1914 ‚Äì 10 March 1942) was an English rugby union international. Born and bred in South Africa, he played first-class cricket with Eastern Province before going to England. ==Cricket== In ten first-class matches from the 1931/32 to 1933/34 Currie Cup seasons, Freakes made 660 runs at 36.66 and took five wickets at 29.00. Three of those were for a representative team called 'The Rest' and he scored a century for them in a match against Transvaal. An opening batsman, he scored two other hundreds, 122 not out versus Natal and 111 against Western Province. His 122* was scored when he was aged just 17 years and 10 months old. ==Rugby career== Freakes came to England in 1936 to study at Oxford's Magdalen College, on a Rhodes scholarship. It was there that he earned his nickname 'Trilby' and he captained the University at the 1938/39 Varsity fixtures. He was capped three times for the England national side, the first of which came against Wales at Cardiff in January 1938 when he kicked a conversion.

Assuming the role of a tank commander on a tiny planet, the player attempts to win each stage by knocking the opposing player off their planet. ==Gameplay== Space Tanks is an artillery game similar to Gravity Wars with a free moving mouse cursor for aiming, selecting tanks, and using the weapon shop. This interface is also used for looking left or right, up and down. An inventory on the heads-up display stores items and weapons. The weapons in Space Tanks are at affected by of each of the planet's gravity and it takes a reasonable amount of trial and error before the player's shots start hitting on target. There are over 30 weapons and 70 tanks in the final game, with each projectile having a different velocity or weight, thus being affected by the gravity in a different manner. The player is given a budget which is to be used on buying tanks, making repairs and using different weapons. Every time the player wins, they earn more money. Replacement tanks must be purchased, so if a player runs out of money and their last tank is destroyed, they are out of the game. ==Reception== Computer Bild Spiele magazine gave the game a 2.02 score of \\"good\\", noting that the graphics are passable, the music shrill but varied and a lack of gameplay options.

However, the character development is less successful. It takes awhile for readers to care about Bobby.

One gesture musical instrument which won first place in the 2008 Chicago Makers Faire at the Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry is an instrument named Airheads that demonstrates the ability to simulate different musical instrument using only your hand gestures moving in the air. ==Air drums== Invented by John R. Folaronwww.Air-Instruments.com a gesture musical instrument which won 1st place in the 2008 Chicago Makers Faire at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. This instrument, named Airheads, demonstrates the ability to simulate different musical instruments using only hand gestures moving in the air. Using the instrument as a drummer would has been achieved very effectively for use in live concert performances. ==Air piano== For the air piano, both left and right hands can be used, as well as moving the feet to mimic pressing the piano floor pedals. Besides the imaginary air piano, there is a motion-activated musical instrument interface called an \\"AirPiano\\" which is controlled by waving the hands above the top.\\"airpiano\\", 2007, webpage: www.airpiano.de : in patent note, the word \\"filled\\" is interpreted as \\"filed\\". \\"Student creates AirPiano\\", Ben Rogerson, MusicRadar.com, 2008-07-01 (Tuesday), webpage: Musicradar-2525. The AirPiano is a musical computer interface (from 2007) which allows playing and controlling software instruments simply by moving hands in the air over the device, connected by USB cable. Above the AirPiano is an invisible matrix of virtual keys plus faders, each pre-assigned with MIDI messages and waiting to be triggered, via infrared sensors. The length of each triggered note is determined by the time the hand is placed over the corresponding virtual key. Beyond the feedback of the sounds changing, hand placement is also confirmed by LED feedback. The first version of AirPiano generated polyphonic sound, with 24 keys using 8 faders. The AirPiano software provides for the loading/saving of presets and transposing notes. The AirPiano technique has been filed as a Provisional U.S. Patent Application (Number: 60/989,986). ==Air violin== Besides the gestures to accompany real violin performances, playing the air violin can also be a form of sarcasm, to indicate that another person seems to be rambling with a sob story or whining excessively, in self-pity. \\"What I wish I could have said to my teachers\\", Nogie Demirjian, 2002, L.A.

It existed for three periods between 1881 and 1996 and was represented by seven Members of Parliament. ==Population centres== The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the 1875‚Äì1876 election. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875‚Äì76 election). The number of MƒÅori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Dunedin West, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries. The 1981 census had shown that the North Island had experienced further population growth, and three additional general seats were created through the 1983 electoral redistribution, bringing the total number of electorates to 95. The South Island had, for the first time, experienced a population loss, but its number of general electorates was fixed at 25 since the 1967 electoral redistribution. More of the South Island population was moving to Christchurch, and two electorates were abolished, while two electorates were recreated (including Dunedin West). In the North Island, six electorates were newly created, three electorates were recreated, and six electorates were abolished. The electorate was urban, and comprised a number of suburbs in the west of Dunedin. ==History== The electorate existed in the 19th century from 1881 to 1890. It was represented by: * Thomas Dick 1881‚Äì84 (defeated) * William Downie Stewart 1884‚Äì90 (retired) The electorate was recreated, from 1908 to 1946. Stewart's son, also called William Downie Stewart, represented the electorate for the Reform Party from 1914 to 1935, when he was defeated by Labour's Gervan McMillan. In 1984 the electorate was recreated again, until the introduction of MMP in 1996. Clive Matthewson represented the electorate from 1984 to 1996. He left the New Zealand Labour Party in 1995, and was one of the founders of the United New Zealand party. ===Members of Parliament=== Dunedin West was represented by seven Members of Parliament.

She was famous for her stunts on trapezes suspended from ascending balloons. Leona Dare's real name was Susan Adeline Stuart or Stewart. Her teachers in acrobatics were the Hall brothers, Thomas and Stewart Hall, who were sometimes billed as the \\"Brothers Dare\\". In 1871, she married Thomas HallNew York Times, November 26, 1880Tait, p. 159, claims the Hall brothers were named Thomas and George, and that there were conflicting newspaper reports about whom of the two she married. in New Orleans or in New York City (sources disagree). The same year, she debuted as an artist at Nixon's Amphitheatre in New York City;Slout, p. 70. a year later, she was with the circus of Joel E. Warner. Her specialty was the \\"iron jaw\\" act, in which she held onto her supporting apparatus with nothing but the strength of her bite, or in which she herself held other artists or their supports with her mouth only. In August 1872, she performed in IndianapolisCrouch, p. 478. for the first time suspended under a hot-air balloon, lifting her husband and partner off the ground, holding him by his waistband only with her teeth.Tait, p. 45. Subsequently, she toured through Europe. Her performances at the foremost locations in Europe, including the Folies Berg√®re in Paris, made her rather famous in Europe. In 1875, she left her husband, though she later claimed he had abandoned her. An accident in the late 1870s forced her to put her career on hold for several years. In June 1880, while still recovering, she married Ernest Theodore Grunebaum in London, a well-off son of a family from Vienna. Back in Chicago later that year, it was discovered that she was still married to Hall, yet she managed to get a divorce from Hall (in absentia) on November 15 and remarried Grunebaum in Chicago on November 17, 1880. Newspaper advertisement for Leona Dare's ascents from Crystal Palace in London Later in the early 1880s, she appeared again on European stages. In 1884, she had accident during a performance in Valencia in Spain, where she let drop her partner, who died of his injuries.New York Times, November 23, 1884.The Entr'acte, December 13, 1884. In 1888, Leona Dare teamed up with Swiss balloonist Eduard Spelterini. He would take her, suspended under the basket of his balloon, to great heights (some sources speak of 5,000 feet), while she performed her acrobatics. Their ascents in June and July 1888 at the Crystal Palace in London made them world- famous, and together they toured through Europe until Moscow. In October 1889, they were at Bucharest, apparently their last performance together.Capus, p. 44, claims they parted at Moscow and Spelterini \\"appeared alone in November 1889 in Bucharest\\". According to Buiu, their first ascent at Bucharest was on October 8 and their last ascent together from Cismigiu gardens was on October 22, while Spelterini's scientific ascent in Bucharest was on November 8. After 1889, no references of them performing together have been found, and Spelterini subsequently turned southwards going to Egypt. In 1890, Leona Dare was again in Paris. During another balloon show, she let go of the trapeze when the balloon drifted away, and broke her leg.Tait, p. 46. Around 1894/95, she appears to have stopped performing altogether.Tait, p. 159, footnote 24. After her retirement, she lived at Oakwood, Staten Island. She died at Spokane, Washington at the age of 67. == References  Sources == *Leona Dare's Trapeze, New York Times, June 9, 1879; from the London News, May 29, 1879. * The Romance in a Trapeze Performer's Life, New York Times, November 26, 1880; from the Chicago Tribune, November 17, 1880. *An Acrobat's Nervousness, New York Times, November 23, 1884. *Leona Dare, Acrobat, Dead, New York Times, May 25, 1922. *Leona Dare's accident at the Princess's Theatre, Valencia, Spain, The Entr'acte, London, December 13, 1884. *Buiu, I.

He was a Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1987 to 2003, representing the electorates of Heathcote (1987‚Äì88, 1999‚Äì2003), Burragorang (1988‚Äì1991) and Bulli (1991‚Äì99). He was a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr Labor government. McManus was born in Scotland, and his family migrated to Australia when he was a child. He attended Helensburgh Primary School, St Patrick's College in Sutherland and St George Technical College in Kogarah. He worked as a junior postal officer after leaving school, before joining the Royal Australian Navy, where he served as a sonar operator from 1963 to 1971, serving in Borneo, the Malacca Straits and Vietnam. He won the United States Unit Commendation for his service during Operation Sea Dragon in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. He left the Navy in 1971, and worked as a senior inspector with his local water board until his election to parliament. He was also an alderman with the City of Wollongong council and Illawarra County Council from 1977 until 1983. McManus entered state politics in 1987 after winning Labor endorsement for a difficult by-election, sparked by the resignation of former Labor minister Rex Jackson amidst a serious corruption scandal which would later lead to Jackson's imprisonment. The race was made further difficult for Labor due to Jackson's surprise decision to run as an independent, but McManus survived a severe anti-Labor swing to take the seat ahead of Liberal candidate Allan Andrews. After a hostile electoral redistribution, McManus shifted to the safer seat of Burragorang at the 1988 general election, where Andrews won Heathcote at his second attempt. McManus again shifted to the newly revived seat of Bulli at the 1991 election, and was re-elected in 1995 with the election of the Carr Labor government. McManus served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government, and retired in 2003. He has worked as a consultant since leaving politics. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Ian McManus"},{"id":"20390513","text":"Recorded by Len Milne at 234 Main Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Live at the High & Lonesome Club is the fourth album from The Perpetrators.

Pencoys is a smaller settlement which adjoins Four Lanes immediately to the south. St Andrew's Church was consecrated by Bishop Benson in 1881. ==Geography== Four Lanes and Pencoys are on the upland plateau of the Carnmenellis granite batholith. Four Lanes village centre is 220 metres (720 feet) above sea level.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The village is centred on The Square which is at a crossroads where the north-to-south B3297 Redruth-Helston road is intersected by unclassified lanes to Stithians (south- east) and Carnkie (north-west). Post-1960s housing estates are to the south of the crossroads. ==History== Four Lanes is the main settlement in the ecclesiastical parish of Pencoys which was established in 1881. In earlier times the area was part of the parish of Wendron and the name Pencoys means the end of the wood. Maria Charlotte Broadley, the wife of the Vicar of Carnmenellis, wished to provide a church for the outlying hamlet of Four Lanes but her husband died and she moved elsewhere. In the late 1870s she returned and ensured that a building used for occasional services which had become dilapidated was repaired. She still wished to provide a proper church, made appeals for funds and the new church was consecrated on 4 April 1881 at a cost of ¬£1,250. Mrs Broadley had given ¬£1,050 of this and also the cost of many of the fittings and the east window. She is commemorated by a plaque in Pencoys church placed there in 1977 as part of the celebrations of the centenary of the Diocese of Truro.Rendell, Joan (1982) Cornish Churches. St Teath: Bossiney Books; pp. 59, 61 The church seats two hundred and is built in the Early English style with nave, chancel and a small north chapel used for vestries. The stone was quarried locally with arches and dressings of granite and Wild Duck stone. The parish war memorial is the church's lych gate (built in 1921) which features commemorative plaques in the gateway. The older part of Four Lanes straddles the B3297 road north of the crossroads and post-1960s housing estates are to the south of the crossroads. The classical soprano singer Wendy Eathorne was born at Four Lanes in 1939. ;Note ==The village today== There are two pubs in the village; the Victoria Inn at The Square and the Sportsman's Arms three hundred metres south on the Helston road. Four Lanes has a male voice choir which takes part in competitions and festivals at local and national level. One of Brenda Wootton's albums, Gwavas Lake (Burlington Records, BURL 008, 1980), features the choir. ==Transmitting station== Redruth (Four Lanes) television transmitting station is situated half-a-mile north- west of the village at , and has a 173-metre (568 ft) high guyed steel lattice mast. It includes a high guyed steel lattice mast with square cross section, which is surmounted by the television transmitting antennas, bringing the overall height of the structure to . It is owned and operated by Arqiva. It transmits UHF Analogue television signals, DVB television, FM radio and DAB radio. It is sometimes referred to as Four Lanes, because of the proximity of the mast to neighbouring village of the same name. The main mast is lit with four bright red aircraft warning lights, a statutory requirement of the Civil Aviation Authority. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Grigg, John (1978).

The electorate was to the southwest of Christchurch, and was suburban and semi-rural. ==Population centres== The 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the Representation Act in 1886, initiated by Muldoon's National Government. As part of the 1976 census, a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re- registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred MƒÅori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island.

Father-daughter dances are common at wedding receptions in the United States although not all weddings have a father-daughter dance. In situations where a daughter's father is not available, he may be substituted with a man of an older generation, such as an uncle or the father of a close friend. Father-daughter dances are very common at quincea√±eras and debutante balls. A common trend in 2018 at wedding receptions is to only have a formal first dance for the wedding couple and party songs, forgoing the father-daughter dance. At weddings, the father- daughter dance typically takes place immediately following the first dance of a married couple. Sometimes the father-daughter and mother-son dance are combined into one dance. If the first dance takes place upon entry into the reception venue, the father-daughter dance normally happens following toasts and will be followed by the cake cutting.https://www.brides.com/story/reception-timeline-tips The song selected for the father-daughter dance normally describes a love between a dad and his daughter. In the mid to late 20th century, popular father-daughter songs included \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" by Al Martino and The Mills Brothers, \\"My Girl\\" by The Temptations, \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" by Stevie Wonder and \\"Father and Daughter\\" by Paul Simon. In the 2010s, popular father-daughter songs include \\"I Loved Her First\\" by Heartland, \\"My Little Girl\\" by Tim McGraw and \\"Butterfly Kisses\\" by Bob Carlisle.https://www.myweddingsongs.com/wedding- song-lists/father-daughter-songs/ A father-daughter dance can also refer to an event where girls and their fathers can dance. Many elementary schools have father-daughter dances, particularly on Valentine's Day. While these events are intended for girls and their fathers, some schools allow other people, such as the girls' cousins, brothers and close friends to attend. Mother-son dances use the same analogy of a son and his mother, although they are not as common as father-daughter dances. == See also == * Purity ball ==References== Category:Dance culture Category:Fatherhood Category:School dances Category:Debutante balls Category:Elementary and primary schools Category:Children's entertainment ","title":"Father-daughter dance"},{"id":"20390877","text":"Bagahi is a Village Development Committee in Rautahat District in the Narayani Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

It was bought in Paris at the sale of La Peau de l'Ours on 2 March 1914 by Jewish entrepreneur Harry Fuld, who founded Frankfurt, Germany based H. Fuld & Co. Telefon und Telegraphenwerke AG, which made telephones. After Fuld died on a business trip to Switzerland in 1932, his art collection passed to his son, Harry Fuld, Jr. After the ascent of the Nazi party to power, Fuld fled to safety in Switzerland in 1937, packing the collection into crates. But the collection never left Germany and, after confiscation by the SS, it somehow became the property of SS officer Kurt Gerstein. A pre-war expert in decontamination techniques, Gerstein was assigned to the Hygiene Institute of the SS, becoming responsible for delivering Zyklon B poison used in the final solution gas chambers, including Auschwitz concentration camp. At the end of World War II, on 22 April 1945, Gerstein surrendered to the French commandant of the occupied town of Reutlingen. He received a sympathetic reception and was transferred to a residence in a hotel in Rottweil, there writing out the Gerstein Report. He was later transferred to the notorious Cherche-Midi military prison where he was apparently treated as a war criminal. On July 25, 1945 while awaiting trial he was found hanged dead in his cell, an alleged suicide.Friedl√§nder 1969, pp. 218-222. Continuing the investigation into Gerstein's war crimes, French police recovered Le Mur Rose from a cache of stored art near Gerstein's home in T√ºbingen, Germany.

Following the Soviet invasion, Rahimi fled Afghanistan, taking refuge in Pakistan for a year and then relocating to France in 1985 after receiving political asylum. On completion of his studies at the Sorbonne, Rahimi joined a Paris-based production company where he produced seven documentaries for French television, as well as several commercials. Taking time off in the late 1990s, Rahimi embarked on his first writing project. His 2000 Dari/Persian book, Earth and Ashes, was an instant bestseller in Europe and South America. A movie based on this book, directed by Rahimi, was awarded the Prix du Regard vers l'Avenir at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The film was featured in 50 festivals, winning a total of 25 awards including the one at Cannes and a Golden Dhow award for best feature film at the Zanzibar International Film Festival. After the fall of the Taliban, Rahimi returned to his native Afghanistan in 2002, after 17 years of exile, and used a 150-year-old box camera to take pictures of Kabul. Six of these photographs were later purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In November 2008, Rahimi won France's most prestigious literary prize, the 105-year-old Prix Goncourt,Academie Goncourt and Dave Itzkoff, \\"Afghan Author Wins French Literary Prize,\\" The New York Times, November 10, 2008. for Syngu√© Sabour. Described as \\"sober and alive\\" by French culture minister Christine Albanel, it was translated into English as The Patience Stone. Rahimi's fourth book and his first in French, the novel tells the story of a woman whose husband has been wounded in battle in a country resembling Afghanistan and now lies as paralysed as a stone. Upon his return to Afghanistan in 2002, Rahimi became involved with the nation's largest media group, Moby Group, as a senior creative advisor. The group, established by brothers Saad Mohseni, Zaid Mohseni and Jahid Mohseni, owns Tolo TV, Arman FM, Kaboora Production, Barbud Music, Lemar TV, Afghan Scene Magazine, and a host of other media related entities. Rahimi, who divides his time between Kabul and Paris, continues to work closely with the Moby Group in developing programs and genres for its media outlets, as well as helping develop and train a new generation of Afghan filmmakers and directors. Rahimi created and developed Tolo TV's \\"Raz ha een Khana\\" (Secrets of this House), Afghanistan's first soap opera. The hugely popular \\"Secrets of this House\\" took the Special Award at the Seoul Drama Awards in October 2008. Rahimi directed a 2012 film adaptation of \\"Syngu√© Sabour\\" or The Patience Stone from a screenplay he co-authored with Jean- Claude Carri√®re. The film, starring Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, was selected as the Afghan entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.

He had enrolled in architecture in 1929, switched to art with Roger Bissiere at Academie Ranson in 1935 just prior to the father's death in 1936.20th Century Art, 1996 Taschen Publishers In 1937 at the Paris International Exposition, the French government appointed Sonia Delaunay and Robert Delaunay to represent avant-garde art in Paris transportation centers such as Air Palace and Railways Palace.Ferrier, JL, Art of our Century, 1999 Chene-Hechette Publishers The couple was given the task to employ and reside with 50 unemployed artists for March and April to create a substantial project of of artwork. Among the artists were Bissiere, Jean Bertholle, and Manessier, who worked on four murals. The following year he married painter Therese Simonnet. In 1939 Manessier was called into military conscription, as a technical draftsman.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Prager Publishers In 1940, expecting the birth of his son, he found work as a farmhand to support the growing familyHodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers but by 1941 he returned to Paris to exhibit in the Gallery Braun show \\"20 Young Painters\\" that ushered into France the non-figurative movement.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers Despite the abstract style centered in what the occupying Germans deemed \\"degenerate\\" modes, and despite Manessier's teaching at the anti-authority and anti-indoctrination organization Young France, the painter was not censored or molestedFerrier, JL, Art of Our Century, 1999, Chene-Hechette Publishers The Young France organization prepared youth for work at the end of the German Occupation, with a teaching staff that also included Jean Bazaine, Jean Vilar, Jean Desailly, Andre Clement.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers Manessier left teaching in 1943 for painting full-time. During this year he made a 3-day visit to the Trappist monastery in Orne. Demoralized by the Occupation and war, at the monastery he was deeply moved by the ancient garb and art, chants and worship, rhythms of work and silence by the monks. \\"I felt profoundly the cosmic link between sacred chanting and the world of nature all around. These men who sang were perhaps a little out of touch with the world but there was truth in their relationship with nature\\" he recalled.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers \\"If we had the evangelical purity of the Primitives, if we could look at nature with all innocence of love, then perhaps we could depict the sacred as they did. But we are men of this century: broken, exploded.\\" Thus began the fertile period of abstract painting: \\"mosaic-like patterns, luminous colors often supported by a heavy black grid.\\"20th Century Art, Taschen Publishers Between paintings, he soon began to explore other mediums for expression. In 1945 his daughter was born, and the 34-year-old Manessier was commissioned to produce costumes and sets for Marie-Anne Victoire production at Studio des Champs-√âlys√©es.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers In 1947 he was commissioned to produce two stained glass windows for a Breseux churchFerrier, JL, Art of Our Century, 1999 Chene-Hechette Publishers In 1949 he produced a tapestry for the Dominicans of Saulchoir, Seine-et-Oise.Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers These other mediums were ongoing supplements to his painting, throughout his career (selected theatre work includes a 1960 Nervi Italy mounting of the Decameron involving 340 costumes and 18 sets, costumes for a 1963 production of Galileo Galilei at Theatre National Populaire, Paris; selected stained glass work includes 1952 project at All Saints Church in Basel, 1957 project at Chapel of Ste Therese in Nord, 1959 at Munsterkirche in Essen, 1964 at St Gereau in Cologne, and 1968 for Paris' Convent of the Soeurs de l'Assomption; selected tapestry work includes 1952 commission for State of France, 1957 benediction cape for a Nord church, and a 1969 commission for the National Arts Center in Ottawa)Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers, This latter project in Canada triggered for Manessier another spiritual awakening. When visiting Canada in 1967 to view the projected Arts building site and to assess the Ottawa light, he was inspired during discussions of Canada's large areas of undeveloped land and Inuit art and life relatively untouched by Western culture: \\"I had a feeling of having penetrated elemental nature. The bottom of the lake is full of roots and of decomposed vegetation, and nature is reborn by way of all this. Never have I experienced a similar sensation. I discovered a prehistoric dimension.\\"Hodin, JP, Manessier, 1972 Praeger Publishers He was the victim of a car accident in Loiret on 28 July 1993, and died four days later at the Source hospital in Orl√©ans. His funeral was held at the church of Saint- S√©pulcre d'Abbeville and he was buried in the Cimeti√®re de Saint-Ouen at his birthplace. ==Selected awards== *1953 S√£o Paulo Biennale, 1st Prize for Painting *1954 Vienna Exhibition of Sacred Art, 1st Prize *1955 Carnegie Institute Pittsburgh, International Grand Prize for Contemporary Painting *1955 Valencia Venezuela, International Painting Prize *1958 Grenchen Switzerland Triennale, 1st Prize for Engravings *1958 Venice Biennale, International Institute of Liturgical Art: for painting ¬´Crown of Thorns¬ª (Fr.

Domariyaganj is the nearest town to Hallaur village. The name was derived from Chapter Hal-ata (Al-Insan) of the Quran by Meer Syed Shah Abdur Rasool (Meera Baba). Hallaur has a post office with PIN 272191 and homoeopathic and Ayurvedic dispensaries and a maternity home run by the State government. Bhatangwan village was merged into Hallaur and became a de facto part of Hallaur. It is 44 kilometres northwest of Siddharthnagar district and 49 kilometres north of Basti district headquarters, neighbouring Domariaganj its headquarters. It is one of the biggest villages of the district and hence is sometimes because of its vast area referred to as a town by the local people of Siddhartha Nagar. Hallaur bazaar, a weekly shopping market, is the backbone of all trading activities of the area. The bazaar was established in 1907 by Meer Akber Husain, a prominent figured landlord and elderly person of old Basti district. Hallaur is a well-known place in the fields of literacy, education, art and culture, and social and political awareness. ==History== Al Kadhimiya Mosque where Imam Musa al-Kazim & Imam Mohammad al-Taqi al Jawwad are buried in Iraq As per historical evidence some 335 years ago (during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb), a noble and small family of Sayyids, led by Shah Sayyid Abdur Rasool along with his family migrated from the Persian City of Toos to India during the Mughal period. Shah Syed Abdur Rasool later came to be known as \\"Meera Baba\\". He was a devout Twelver Shiite.In fact ancestors of more than 20% of present sadaat population was migrated from nearby villages such as Pandri, Sisai, Bhuigaawan, Pokhra, Bangawaan and Pipra during the past 250 years. Some migrated even 50 to 60 years ago. Meera Baba's tomb is in the heartland of Hallaur and old natives of Hallaur who are descendants of Meera Baba and his brothers revere him a lot. Every year urs of Meera Baba is commemorated and attended by huge number of people. A huge gathering pay their homage and recite verses of the Quran at his tomb daily especially on every Thursday. As per historical evidences Mughal Emperor Alamgir II visited Hallaur and was so impressed by Meera Baba's charms and divine power that he gifted five villages to Meera Baba. Shah Abdur Rasool Trust is still functional in Hallaur. The trust is responsible for maintenance of Bada Imambargah, maintenance of tomb of Meera Baba, organising anniversaries, etc. Day of Ashura procession on 10th Moharram, mourning procession of 7th Moharram and similar other processions are organised by the trust (Waqf) round the year from the grants released by Shia Central Waqf Board in favour of Waqf Shah Alamgir II.The present trustee is Janab Shah Saiyyed Salman Mehdi. It has been said by the local Hallauris that Meer Shah Abdur Rasool faced hard-hitting confrontation from the tribal settled in Hallaur who were known as \\"Tharus\\". The Tharus asked Meera Baba to prove himself being a true Syed and show some miracles commensurate with their magical performances. Meera Baba once brushing his teeth with a Reetha stick sowed the same in the land within the premises of today's Jama Masjid of Hallaur. Within few days a sapling emerged. The whole Tharu community became his followers and most of them embraced Islam. That miraculous tree is still alive at the entrance of Jama Masjid. Hallauris keep the leaves of that tree as trophy. All Hallauris believe that as long as Meera Baba is in Hallaur, this a secured place. This area was named Hallaur either by Meera Baba or by his brothers. It is a prominent place near Domariaganj in the District of Siddharthnagar of Uttar Pradesh in India. Generally the natives of this area are small landlords and agriculturists by profession. Soon they realized the importance of education and as such presently they can be found in. Generally they visit Hallaur on few occasions such as Muharram. Hallaur was actively involved in first war of Indian Independence. Begum Hazrat Mahal of Awadh took refuge on her way towards Nepal when she was being chased by British Army. Her small contingent was safely helped and guided by Shah Kabeer Ali under the leadership of Meer Muhammad Bakhsk. The British Army punished the Hallauris for this. No murder or any other heinous crime has yet occurred in Hallaur. ==Demographics== As per the Census held in India in 2001, Hallaur has a population of approximately 6000 people, 50:50 men to women. However, after amalgamation of neighbouring Bhatangwa village with that of Hallaur, now Bhatangwa is part of Hallaur and with that Hallaur has an estimated total population of approximately 18,000 to 20,000 people including those of the adjoining areas. Residents of Hallaur are referred as Hallauris. Most of the Hallauris practice the Shia Islam religion with considerable population of other faiths such as Sunni Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and a dozen Christians. Christians also have their missionary School and Hospital named as St. Thomas on Highway No. 26 of Hallaur. Most of the Hallauri Muslims are Twelver Shiites. Around 85% of entire population is Muslim out of which more than 90% Shiites are from the Syed families, they are predominantly devout Shias. The remaining 15% of population has Buddhists and , Hindus and Christian population. The Hindus settled in Hallaur have decades old history. They were given land by Syed landlords to settle down with their families in Hallaur. A separate locality of Dalits still exists in Hallaur on the land provided by Syeds. They have a good rapport with the other communities of hallaur. ==Education and literacy== The literacy rate amongst the people is considerably higher than other people living in surrounding area. Due to unemployment, people of this town are compelled to work in metropolitan cities, the Middle East and other countries for their living. A substantial number of people work in the government sector. Religious educational institute like Madrasas was established by the Late Alhaj Syed Ali Hasan Rizvi (Tehsildar Sb) and is running successfully.

Makhtab and Madrasas are the preferred sources of religious education for all preferably for women. Fine arts, craft and composition of Urdu poetry are major hobbies of native Hallauris. Hallaur has hosted All India Shia Conference which was attended by important religious leaders and also hosted the executive body meeting of \\"Anjuman Wazeefa Sadaat wa Momineen.\\" ==Culture and religion== Hallauri are influenced by Persian as well as Indian culture. The language used by them is unique too. Being a Shiite-dominated town, Hallaur is becoming a Shiite center of eastern Uttar Pradesh because of its sizable population of Shia Muslims. A huge gathering can be seen during the month of Moharram. The great and renowned scholar and theologian from Saran district of (Bihar) state of India ‚ÄúAllamah Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi‚Äù who actively promoted Islam in East Africa and wrote number of books on Shiite theology and jurisprudence had served as Imam of Jama Masjid of Hallaur in his early days (1948‚Äì51).

However, most of the immigrants of this town are well connected to their roots as they frequently visit their motherland especially during the month of Moharram. A monthly Hindi magazine 'Dost Ki Baat' edited by Nafees Haider Hallauri and a newspaper named Hallaur Sandesh edited by Roshan Rizvi, another newspaper 'Watchman', edited by Helal Haider Rizvi also give glimpses of Hallauri thoughts and culture. Badshah Husain Rizvi contributed in Hindi literature. 'Parivartan' a Hindi magazine was a good effort of Sultan Ahmad Rizvi and his brothers. Jamaali Sahab has also written several Urdu novels which were published with the assistance of UP Urdu Academy. Presently, much work is being done by Dr Wazahat Rizvi in respect of Urdu literature. At the cultural level, Sultan Ahmad Rizvi and his brothers established 'AAG' (Armature Artist Guild) which has done commendable work in the field of Art, Drama and Theater.

Manzar Rizvi and Khurshid Ahmad (R.K) respectively. Anwar Abbas Rizvi residing in Gorakhpur also contributed in the field of radio and TV. Hallauris are a unique community and most of them have the same resemblance. \\"Anjuman Farogh Matam\\" [Green Party] and \\"Anjuman Guldasta Matam\\" [Black Party] are the registered organisations behind all religious activities of Hallauris. \\"Anjuman Urooj Matam\\" is the youth wing of Farogh Matam and \\"Anjuman Ghuncha Matam\\" is the youth wing of Guldasta Matam. Every Hallauri is either affiliated to Farogh Matam or Guldasta Matam. Unlimited religious activities are performed by both parties round the year. Locally, Farogh Matam is named as Hari [Green] Party whereas Guldasta Matam is nicknamed as Kali/Safed [Black] (Ujari)Party.

The Codrington experiment was to baptise and instruct in Christian education which was greeted with much suspicion by other Barbadian slave owners in the 18th century. Codrington managers were ordered to give his people time off for themselves (usually a Saturday), Sunday being reserved for Christian instruction through which they were to have the benefits of education and the consolations of Christian religion. There is some dispute as to the exact date of the school's foundation. Building work is recorded as having commenced in 1714, but was not finished until 1743.The Barbados General Almanac for 1848, Joseph Bayley, Bridgetown, p. 83. The Barbados Pocket Book of 1838 however records that the Codrington Foundation School was founded in 1721. When the school opened its doors to twelve foundationers to \\"teach them gratis, the Sons of such Persons as shall be judged not to be in Sufficient Circumstances to bring them up in learning the learned languages\\" on 9 September 1745, some recognise this date officially as its inception. Other pupils were fee paying and most were boarders. The Lodge School is therefore one of the oldest secondary educational establishments on Barbados. The bequest, Codrington Foundation School, was established with the purpose of educating boys who could be subsequently trained in \\"the study and practice of divinity, physic and chirurgery\\" there and at other seminaries in the region. In History of Barbados its author Robert Hermann Schomburgk gives an early account of Codrington College on pages 111‚Äì123. The first Bishop of Barbados, William Hart Coleridge , contributed immensely to the development of education in Barbados. The promotion of education was high on his agenda and the number of schools increased from eight to 83 during his episcopate. The number of children receiving education in these schools increased from 500 to 7000. The hurricane of 1780 ruined many buildings on the island, including those of the school. Earlier in 1775, the school was closed as a result of financial difficulties with the Codrington estates and it was not until 1789 that it was able to open again, continuing in a precarious manner with a succession of Headmasters, such that by the middle of the last decade of the 18th century it was not flourishing. The appointment of Rev. M. Nicholson in 1797 marked an improvement academically. Under his leadership Foundation Scholarships were offered in 1819 to students to enable them to go up to further education. Coleridge reorganised Codrington Foundation School so that it became in 1827 a training establishment for clergy as had been intended by its founder, Christopher Codrington. The Grammar School was transferred to the Chaplain's Lodge on the upper estate (from which the school later took its name) in 1829 under the charge of the Rev. John Packer and finally settled where it is now located on Codrington‚Äôs Society Estate in the parish of St John. Measures were taken for the opening of the college \\"no longer as a mere Grammar school for boys, but as a strictly collegiate institution for the education of young men, especially with a view to Holy Orders\\" (Society for the Propagation of the Gospel report on Codrington College, 1847). In 1846 the Barbados Legislature made its first state grant of ¬£750 for education. The Rev. Richard Rawle was appointed as Principal of Codrington College and the training of elementary school teachers was undertaken. In 1850 the first Education Act was passed which also raised the grant to secondary schools to ¬£3,000 per annum. By June of that year under the headship of Rev. W. Webb the numbers at the school had grown to 39 boys and two years later this had increased to 63 pupils, 48 of whom were boarders. In 1878 the governing body of the Lodge School was properly constituted and in the following year, the Government took over the running of the school, meeting all the expenses of the institution and paying a small stipend to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPC). ==Middle years 1880 to 1930== The government leased the lands containing the school from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the school reopened in 1881 as a grant maintained First Grade School administered by a governing body with Mr Tracey as Headmaster. An Education Commission established by Bishop Mitchinson secured an affiliation of Codrington College to Durham University.Charles Pitcher Clarke, Constitutional Crisis of 1876 in Barbados, Bridgetown: Herald Press, 1896. Improvements were made to the school, but its grammar school ethos remained unchanged. On the retirement of Tracey in 1892, and with frequent changes of headmasters, the school floundered somewhat. In 1899, when O. DeC. Emtage was appointed Headmaster, the school began to flourish again under his leadership and by 1902 it had outgrown its accommodation. Building works were started and new wings were constructed to provide a library, improved science lecture rooms and a reading room. Also at the turn of the century, Mr Emtage instituted the annual speech at which athletic meetings were held. Prior to 1900 these were only held occasionally. In 1903 the Cadet Corps at The Lodge started and was the first such unit in the West Indies. The Latin quote \\"Possunt Quia Posse Videntur\\" by Roman poet Virgil is the school‚Äôs motto chosen by Mr Emtage, is also the school motto for Christ College, Brecon, Wales founded by Royal Charter in 1541 by King Henry VIII as well as for The Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles California. The English translation of the motto is \\"They Can Because They Think They Can\\". The school Arms and Crest were designed by Mrs Evan Sealy, wife of a former rector of St John in conjunction with Mr Emtage in the first decade of the 20th century. The school crest of the leading seahorse comes from the Barbados Arms. The coat of arms has a white field, indicative of purity and uprightness; a black and fess, hinting that the qualities signified by the field would be strenuously defended; and finally three Maltese crosses, the device of St John the Apostle and the Knights Templar of the same name. The fess and white field were adopted from the arms of Codrington College, the lions of the latter being replaced by Maltese crosses The Lodge School Record, 1911. When Mr Emtage resigned in 1931, the school could hardly be recognised as the one he took over in 1899. The school roll had increased to over 100, with nearly 60 being boarders. ==1930 to present== With the appointment of Rev. H. B. Gooding to succeed Mr Emtage, The Lodge School had finally produced its own headmaster. The new headmaster re- introduced Greek into the curriculum and encouraged the study of Classics. In 1935 the Memorial Hall was completed, partly to accommodate the increased number of boarders on the first floor, but also to provide for more classrooms. Construction of a new science/laboratory block accommodating additional classrooms on a second floor also took place. The number of applications to join the school increased, especially from neighbouring islands, and when Gooding retired in 1941 the school roll had passed 150, which included about 70 boarders. The Memorial Hall was built from funds raised almost exclusively by Old Boys in honour of former pupils who died in the First World War. It was opened in 1935 and bronze plaques bearing the names of those who died in both World Wars were added in 1965. In May 1944, the Sanatorium and Library was destroyed by fire. The Library was temporarily rehoused in locked cupboards in a classroom until 1953 when a small room became available where the books were stored. The new library rebuilt from subscriptions and re-opened in 1955. Further building works were undertaken and the boarding establishment was enlarged to accommodate 30 more termly boarders by 1945. By June 1946, the school roll had increased to 213.The Lodge School Record, Vol. XXXVII, p. 8. In September 1950 the school roll passed 300 for the first time. In 1959 the Government, through the Education Act, instituted the Common Entrance Examinations to The Lodge and similar secondary education schools on the island. Around this time the school roll exceeded 400. For much of the 1960s, the school population was quite static but pressure by government was beginning to be placed on the school to increase its numbers and the Governing Body acceded to the wishes of the Minister of Education to expand into a three form entry such that the 1967 school roll of 438 had passed 550 by 1970. Two new laboratories were added in 1967 eventually leading to two labs for each of the three science disciplines.The Lodge School Record, Vol. LVI, p. 9. The following year a new classroom block to accommodate a further three classrooms was opened. In 1971 the government instituted free secondary education which immediately impacted on the boarding establishment of the school, such that by 1979 this 234-year aspect of the Lodge School became uneconomic to maintain. In the mid-1970s girls from other schools entered the sixth form. Earlier, in 1953, several girls from a sister school, Codrington High School, came to The Lodge to undertake Science (Chemistry, Physics and Biology)Personal recollection, Dr J. Edward Hutson (attended The Lodge School 1949‚Äì55). A Level instruction, but it was not until 1974 that The Lodge enrolled its first girls into the school. ln 1979 the hundred-year lease the Government was given on the premises by the SPC expired and it took the opportunity to acquire full possession of the premises The Lodge School in October 1983. ==Influence on the development of the Cadet Corps in Barbados== In the latter part of the 1800s and early 1900s, Englishmen coming to the island were struck by the close similarities of the Barbadian grammar schools to the English public schools. However, they noticed that there was a lack of equivalent school discipline, i.e. there was no system of prefects, monitors etc. This shortcoming was rectified in late 1903 when the then Headmaster of The Lodge, Mr. O. Emptage considered that the psychological moment had arrived and he approached the science master, an officer at the time with the Barbados Volunteer Force, with the suggestion to develop, either a regular Cadet Company or at least a Drill Squad. In the first term of 1904 the attempt proved so successful that it was decided that a Cadet Company, with proper military establishment be formed. Thanks to the efforts of the Governor, Sir Fedrick Hudgson, V.D, a gift of 25 drill purpose carbines was presented. These were later supplemented with defunct CLBs. That first Company consisted of 43 Cadets, one Company Sergeant Major, four Corporals, four Lance Corporals, four Front Rank cadets. During that time, a system existed where the better cadets occupied the front rank while others occupied the other ranks. When sufficiently good at drill, a boy was eligible for promotion to the front rank. This allowed a system of development and promotion even before being promoted to non commissioned officer status.

The Memorial Hall will be kept but many buildings will undergo improvements. As of Jan 2015 significant work has taken place with a number of new buildings having been constructed and several buildings refurbished. The original deadline for completion of the Three Phase works was June 2013, but this has slipped. Among the upgrades for the school is a new electronics laboratory and four new information technology laboratories. There is a new pavilion to the south of the old one and the final new construction will be an auditorium. Approximately 95,000 sq ft of land on the south eastern boundary of the compound has been purchased from Guinea Estates Limited to accommodate the new building. ==See also== * Codrington School (Barbados) * Codrington College * List of schools in Barbados ==References== Category:Schools in Barbados Category:Saint John, Barbados Category:Schools with a Royal Charter Category:Educational institutions established in 1745 Category:1740s establishments in the Caribbean ","title":"The Lodge School"},{"id":"20391197","text":"Harsaha is a village development committee in Rautahat District in the Narayani Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

From the age of 14, he started to paint. In 1923 he enrolled as a student at the Boulle school, attending until 1926. From 1927, he worked as a draughtsman, designing interior architecture and furniture until 1936. 1936 could be considered to be a turning point in Singier's career as an artist: he met the painter Charles Walch who encouraged him as a painter, put him in contact with artistic circles and who began to exhibit Singier's work at numerous Parisian Salons from 1936. ==World War II== In 1940, with World War II now underway, Singier was mobilized in the Belgian army and sent to Bagnols-on-Ceze after the German invasion of Belgium. From 1941 to 1944, Singier worked in the workshop of his cabinet maker father. In 1941, Singier joined a group of young artists who showed their work in the exhibition 'Vingt Peintres de tradition francaise' (Twenty Painters of the French Tradition) at the Braun Gallery, an exhibition in defiance of the Nazi military occupation. ==Career== In 1945 he was one of the founding members of the Salon de Mai. In common with many other painters of his generation, after the allied liberation of Western Europe, Singier discovered Kandinsky, Klee, Mondrian and - through them - abstract art. In 1947 Singier was naturalized as a French citizen. In 1949, he had his first solo exhibition at the Billiet- Caputo gallery. From 1951 to 1954, Singier taught at the Ranson Academy, and from 1967 to 1978 at the Paris School of Art. Singier died on 5 May 1984. He is buried in Paris, in the Montparnasse Cemetery. ==See also== *Ouanes Amor Category:1909 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Abstract painters Category:Belgian painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th- century male artists Category:French male painters Category:French people of Belgian descent ","title":"Gustave Singier"},{"id":"20391217","text":"Jatahare is a village development committee in Rautahat District in the Narayani Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

K. Simmons, Chris Messina, Sophie Nyweide, and Bailee Madison. Based on the 2001 novel An Invisible Sign of My Own by Aimee Bender, the film is about a painfully withdrawn young woman who, as a child, turned to math for comfort after her father became ill, and now as an adult, teaches the subject and must help her students through their own crises. For her performance in the film, Bailee Madison received a 2011 Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film. ==Plot== Mona Gray (Jessica Alba) systematically withdraws from life into a world of mathematics after a mysterious mental illness leaves her father (John Shea) incapacitated and a shell of his former self. Forced by her mother to move out on her own, Mona gets a job as a math teacher at an elementary school. There she discovers she has an unorthodox talent for teaching and finds herself thrust back into life again, with children to care for, and a reason to live. Mona takes special interest in one of her students, Lisa Venus (Sophie Nyweide), whose mother is dying of cancer. When fellow teacher Ben Smith (Chris Messina) shows romantic interest in her, Mona reverts to some of her old self-destructive impulses. Eventually, Mona discovers her value in the love she shows her students, and Ben's patience is finally rewarded as the two find love in each other. ==Cast== * Jessica Alba as Mona Gray * Chris Messina as Ben Smith * John Shea as Dad * S√¥nia Braga as Mom * J.

Located near the ancient city of Limyra, it is the largest civil engineering structure of antiquity in the region, spanning the Alakƒ±r √áayƒ± river over a length of on 26 segmental arches. These arches, with a span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, give the bridge an unusually flat profile, and were unsurpassed as an architectural achievement until the late Middle Ages. Today, the structure is largely buried by river sediments and surrounded by greenhouses. Despite its unique features, the bridge remains relatively unknown, and only in the 1970s did researchers from the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute carry out field examinations on the site. == Field examinations == Ancient paving stones. View to the east, along the greenhouses No information on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' accounts from the 19th century. The British archaeologist Charles Fellows was the first to explore the region of Lycia, and visited the bridge in May 1840\\\\. Fellows, as well as T.A.B. Spratt and Edward Forbes, who visited the site two years later, describe it as having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east. However, this mission failed to produce any plans or sketches of the site. The first, and only scientific examination of the bridge was undertaken by the German archaeologists Wolfgang W. Wurster and Joachim Ganzert in two successive days in September 1973, and completed through further visits in subsequent years. Their findings were published in 1978 in the Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger journal of the German Archaeological Institute, with the express intent of bringing the imperiled state of the hitherto almost intact bridge into the spotlight: In 1993, the civil engineer Colin O'Connor summarized their report in his English-language monograph on Roman bridges, and also emphasized the exceptional character of this bridge.: No further scientific examinations of the Limyra Bridge are known. == Location and situation == The rather modest Alakƒ±r √áayƒ±, flowing under the 1st segmented arch. The bridge crosses the Alakƒ±r √áayƒ± stream, whose ancient name is unknown, east of the ruins of Limyra (distance measured from the city's theatre) and north of the modern coastline, close to the modern road from Turun√ßova to Kumluca. The local topography is dominated by the foothills of the To√ßak Daƒüƒ± mountains, which blend here with the alluvial bottomlands of the Bay of Finike. In this transitional area, the bridge was built immediately above the point where the narrow river valley opens into the wide estuary plain, and where the crossing of the river during the rain period would be obstructed by high water. While the eastern end of the bridge levels off at the gravel plain, the western end abuts directly to the rising rock wall of the mountain, presumably for protection against floods. The resulting sharp bend in the course of the road could also be exploited in case of need to block the road. A modern dam, Alakƒ±r Barajƒ±, was constructed upstream for irrigation purposes and flood protection. Lycia did not, in contrast to other Roman provinces, possess a very developed road system. While the north‚Äìsouth traffic was conducted primarily through the few river valleys, the east‚Äìwest routes led, unlike today, mostly on and along the mountain ridges. This particular road, leading from Limyra over the Alakƒ±r √áayƒ± and into the neighbouring region of Pamphylia and Attaleia, must have been of special importance, since the two regions were united in a single province, Lycia et Pamphylia, until the 4th century. In comparison to the main arterial roads of the Roman Empire however, the roads of Lycia were, with width, rather modest and confined to pedestrian and pack animal traffic. This is further corroborated by the fact that no wagon ruts are evident on the paving of the Limyra bridge, nor any traces of a parapet or breastwork. == Construction == The 1st arch seen from the south. With a length of , the Limyra Bridge qualifies as the largest surviving engineering achievement of antiquity in Lycia. The bridge stands on 26 uniform segmental arches consisting of a double, radially laid course of bricks. At the eastern end, the original 27th arch has been replaced by two smaller, semicircular arches of later construction. The latter are built with a single course of bricks. Traces of the original, flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers. At the time of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the springing line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate the dimensions of the remaining bays from their exposed sections. === Architecture ===  Arches and piers  Dimensions of a typical segmental arch The spans of the arches ranged from to (arches 2 and 26 respectively). Based on the size of the spans, one can distinguish four groups, with the following median values: * for four arches (Nos. 2, 3, 7, 21) * for fourteen arches (Nos. 5, 9‚Äì15, 17‚Äì19, 22‚Äì24) * for four arches (Nos. 1, 4, 6, 8) * for three arches (Nos. 16, 20, 25) The reason for this grouping is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match the lay of the river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures in the construction of the barrel vaults (see animation below). Only in a single case, between arches 26 and 27, were Wurster and Ganzert able to determine the breadth of a pier: . Subtracting this value from the common arch span of , a clear span of remains. Since all arches have a rise of ca. , the Limyra Bridge has an unusually large span-to-rise ratio of . Such flattened arches were very rare at the time for stone bridges, and were not matched and surpassed until the reappearance of segmental arch bridges in 14th century Italy. For the largest arch in the Limyra Bridge, the ratio is even greater, spanning a width 6.4 times its height. The two later arches, in contrast, are, with a ratio of 2.7:1, quite ordinary semi-circular arches.  Height  Arches 8 and 9, south side, silted up to the level of the arch abutments. The total height of the bridge could not be determined because most of the structure is silted up. However, the distance between the arches' abutments and the pavement surface could be determined at only . The surface level is almost horizontal: the roadway lies at a height of above sea level between arches 1 to 20, and falls slightly in its eastern section, between arches 21 and 26 to a level of . Since there is no indication of a later sinking of the structure, this nearly uniform height indicates careful levelling and the existence of solid pier foundations. In contrast, the lengthwise axis of the bridge displays often significant deviations from arch to arch.  Statics  Remarkably, the support line of the structure's dead load is almost identical with the curve of the vault arch. The statical analysis of the bridge proves the structure's great load capacity: === Materials === The Limyra bridge was built in a composite manner of brick, stonemasonry, and rubble.  Arches  Arch closeup: double layer of bricks bound with mortar. The bricks of the segmental arches are made of yellow-red clay, mixed with fine brick fragments. The bricks are rectangular plates, measuring ca. and thick. They are placed with the shorter side upright facing outwards, so that the total thickness of the arches measures . The bricks are bound with grout of lime mortar mixed with brick shards and fine gravel, forming -thick joints. The two later semi-circular arches were built with smaller bricks, although surviving bricks from the original arch were re-used at places. The abutment stones are dressed limestone ashlar blocks, and form a sloping surface to support the arches. The double-layer technique facilitated a more effective use of the falsework, since they could be removed and used elsewhere as soon as the lower course was finished: Hypothetical workflow on the bridge: the falsework was moved to another opening as soon as the lower arch rib had been completed. Pavement with projecting corbel stone at the 3rd arch, south side  Superstructure  As far as can be determined, between arches 2 to 21, the outer facing of the superstructure consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, as well as in both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework. The interior of the superstructure consists of a combination of unworked masonry blocks and large river boulders, bound with lime mortar.  Pavement  The bridge surface is located only over the arches' apex, is wide, increasing towards either end at and projects ca. over the superstructure on either side. It is paved with large and irregular limestone cobblestones, although smaller pebbles have been used in the repairs at the two semicircular arches. == Dating == The exact chronological placement of the Limyra bridge is difficult due to its unique place within Roman engineering tradition and the lack of comparable structures. Wurster and Ganzert used following characteristics as a starting point: * multiple arches of same width, and horizontal deck level with only small-gradient ramps on either end * very flat segmental arches built with double, radially layered brick courses * the use of mortar in the stonework * exterior facing primarily rough masonry with interspersed bricks, partly dressed ashlar blocks * exceptionally large paving stones. In contrast to these, most Roman stone bridges were faced with ashlar and rested on voussoir arches, a method which is dominant in other vaulted structures in Lycia too. Compared to the massive and tall semicircular-arched bridges that are typical of Roman architecture, the Limyra bridge, with its flat segmented arches, offers a markedly lower and more elongated appearance, so that Wurster and Ganzert offer a \\"provisional\\" late dating, approximately during the reign of emperor Justinian I in the 6th century, during which the use of mixed brick and stone is attested in other structures of the region. On the other hand, this mixed technique is already present in the 3rd-century AD aqueduct of Aspendos, and the Romans certainly knew how to build segmented-arched bridges, as attested by surviving examples, three of which are listed by Wurster and Ganzert themselves. An earlier construction date in the 2nd or cannot therefore be excluded. The case for an earlier construction date has been strengthened in recent years with the discovery of further seven Roman segmented arch bridges. The remnants of the nearby Kemer Bridge over the river Xanthos, which dates to the 3rd century and has some architectural similarities with the Limyra bridge, could further reinforce that case. == See also == *List of Roman bridges == References  Sources == * * == External links == * * Category:Roman bridges in Turkey Category:Roman segmental arch bridges Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Bridges completed in the 3rd century Category:Lycia Category:Buildings and structures in Antalya Province Category:Arch bridges in Turkey ","title":"Bridge near Limyra"},{"id":"20391400","text":"The Desperadoes Steel Orchestra, also called Despers, are a steelband from Laventille in Trinidad, formed in 1945. ==Origins and evolution== A number of youths in the Laventille Road area began calling their group Morocco/Dead End Kids, before some of them saw a movie entitled \\"The Desperadoes\\" at Royal Cinema on Charlotte in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1943.

Ovid Alley will be changed to Desperslie Crescent in the late 1970's. However, the founders of Desperadoes said, there can be only one steelband here, so the young Spike Jones group had no choice but to merge into Desperadoes. Rudolph \\"Charlo\\" Charles, who came from Spike Jones was given the captaincy in 1961, and he brought in Mr. Beverly Griffith as an arranger. .Smith, Angela (2012) Steel Drums and Steelbands: a History, Scarecrow Press, , pp. 170‚Äì172 Mr. Charles managed Desperadoes up to his passing in 1985.

They won Panorama for the first time the in 1966, with a rendition of Mighty Sparrow's \\"Obeah Wedding\\". Charles recruited a few members away from other steelbands and transformed Desperadoes from a steelband into a STEEL ORCHESTRA. In later years he invited several pantuners such as Bertie Marshall to join. They dropped 'Gay' from the name in the 1970's. Under Rudolph Charles' leadership, the band won Panorama 6 times and Classical Music Festivals on 2 occasions. As of 2020, Desperadoes has 12 Panorama and 5 Classical victories.

The design marked a transitional stage in boiler development, between the early haystack boilers and the later multi-tube fire- tube boilers. A flued boiler is characterized by a large cylindrical boiler shell forming a tank of water, traversed by one or more large flues containing the furnace. These boilers appeared around the start of the 19th century and some forms remain in service today. Although mostly used for static steam plants, some were used in early steam vehicles, railway locomotives and ships. Flued boilers were developed in an attempt to raise steam pressures and improve engine efficiency. Early haystack designs of Watt's day were mechanically weak and often presented an unsupported flat surface to the fire. Boiler explosions, usually beginning with failure of this firebox plate, were common. It was known that an arched structure was stronger than a flat plate and so a large circular flue tube was placed inside the boiler shell. The fire itself was on an iron grating placed across this flue, with a shallow ashpan beneath to collect the non-combustible residue. This had the additional advantage of wrapping the heating surface closely around the furnace, but that was a secondary benefit. Although considered as low-pressure (perhaps ) today, this was regarded as high pressure compared to its predecessors. This increase in pressure was a major factor in making locomotives (i.e. small self-moving vehicles) such as Trevithick's into a practical proposition. == Centre-flue boilers == Middleton locomotive The simplest boiler for locomotives had a single straight flue. It was widely used by many of the early locomotive makers, including Blenkinsop's locomotives for the Middleton railway and Stephenson's Locomotion. This type of boiler is simple to manufacture and strong enough to support \\"high pressure\\" (for the period) steam with expansive working in the cylinders. There is also good gas flow through the large flue, so that the fire receives sufficient draught from the action of a tall chimney alone. However it also has little heating area, so is inefficient and burns a large amount of coal. == Return-flue boilers == Puffing Billy of 1813, showing the domed end of its return-flue boiler (centre of picture) A simple flue must be long if it is to offer adequate heating area. In a short boiler shell, such as required for a steam locomotive, this may be done by using a U-shaped return flue that bends back on itself. Richard Trevithick had already used a return flue with his first 1802 Pen-y-darren engine and 1803 Coalbrookdale locomotive design. These boilers were heavily built of cast iron, short and flat-ended. His 1805 \\"Newcastle\\" locomotive (actually built in Gateshead) began to show one characteristic feature of the return-flued boiler, a prominent dome shape to resist steam pressure in the solid end opposite both furnace and chimney. In this case, the boilermaking, now of wrought iron plates, must have been complicated by Trevithick's single long-travel horizontal cylinder ( diameter√óstroke) which emerged through this domed end. This did make work easier for the fireman though, as he was no longer trying to reach a firedoor beneath the long crosshead of the piston. left William Hedley used this pattern of boiler for his 1813 locomotives Puffing Billy and Wylam Dilly. Through the Wylam colliery and its owner Christopher Blackett, Hedley would have been familiar with Trevithick's engine. Timothy Hackworth's 0-6-0 Royal George of 1827 also used a return-flued boiler, although it is best known for its pioneering use of a deliberate blastpipe to encourage draught on the fire. His lighter weight 0-4-0 version for the Rainhill Trials, Sans Pareil was very similar. Even though they appeared antiquated as soon as the Trials were over, the Canadian Samson of this pattern was built in 1838 and still in service in 1883. === Huber boilers === Huber boiler The last return-flue boilers constructed (other than some stationary boilers) are often considered to be those built by the Huber Co. of Marion, Ohio for their \\"New Huber\\" traction engines, from 1885 to 1903. These were not, however, return- flue boilers in the sense used here, but rather return-tube boilers. They had a single large cylindrical furnace tube, a combustion chamber external to the boiler's pressure shell, then multiple, narrow fire-tubes returning to a horseshoe-shaped smokebox above and around the firedoor. The proximity of this smokebox to the fireman led to their nickname of \\"belly burners\\". Their design thus has more in common with the horizontal launch-type boilers (as used by Sir Arthur Heywood) or the Scotch marine boiler than they do with the simple single-flue boiler. By this time, the locomotive boiler had become ubiquitous for traction engines. Compared to this, the advantage of the Huber boiler was that the firetubes could be replaced more easily, without needing to work from within an enclosed firebox. ==Cornish boiler== Cornish boiler The simplest form of flued boiler was Richard Trevithick's \\"high-pressure\\" Cornish boiler, first installed at Dolcoath mine in 1812. This is a long horizontal cylinder with a single large flue containing the fire. As the furnace relied on natural draught, a tall chimney was required at the far end of the flue to encourage a good supply of air (oxygen) to the fire. For efficiency, Trevithick's innovation was to encase beneath the boiler with a brick-built chamber. Exhaust gases passed through the central flue and then routed outside and around the iron boiler shell. To keep the chimney clear of the firing space, the brick flue passed first underneath the centre of the boiler to the front face, then back again along the sides and to the chimney. Cornish boilers had several advantages over the preceding wagon boilers: they were composed of mostly curved surfaces, better to resist the pressure. Their flat ends were smaller than the flat sides of the wagon boiler and were stayed by the central furnace flue, and sometimes by additional long rod stays. A less obvious advantage was that of boiler scale. Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water. This reduced heating efficiency and could in extremis lead to local overheating and failure of the boiler plates. In the flued boiler, any sediment fell past the furnace flue and settled out at the bottom of the boiler shell, where it had less effect. In model engineering, the Cornish boiler, particularly when fitted with Galloway tubes (see Lancashire Boiler, below), is an excellent choice for gas-fired boilers and model steam boats. It is simple to build and as efficient as any small-scale boiler. == Butterley boiler == Butterley boiler, from Fairbairn's lecture of 1851 The Butterley or \\"whistle mouth\\" boiler is a little-known design derived from the Cornish pattern, produced by the noted Butterley boilerworks of Derbyshire. It is basically a Cornish boiler with the lower half of the shell around the furnace removed, so as to permit a large fire to be lit. This made it popular in the textile mills of the Pennines, where the hard Northern coal was of less calorific value than the Welsh coal used in the South West and required a larger fire. Alternatively it may be considered as a shortened Cornish boiler with a wagon boiler placed in front of it with a larger fire beneath that. It suffers the same drawback as the wagon boiler: the concave firebox plate is mechanically weak and this either limits the working pressure or requires extra mechanical staying. ==Lancashire boiler== Lancashire boiler, from Fairbairn's lecture Lancashire boiler at Pinchbeck Pumping Station The Lancashire boiler is similar to the Cornish, but has two large flues containing the fires instead of one. It is generally considered to be the invention of William Fairbairn in 1844, although his patent was for the method of firing the furnaces alternately, so as to reduce smoke, rather than the boiler itself., Fairbairn, 1844 Stephenson's early 0-4-0 locomotive \\"Lancashire Witch\\" had already demonstrated the use of twin furnace tubes within a boiler 15 years earlier. Fairbairn had made a theoretical study of the thermodynamics of more efficient boilers, and it was this that had led him to increase the furnace grate area relative to the volume of water. A particular reason for this was the so-far poor adoption of the Cornish boiler in the cotton mills of Lancashire, where the harder local coal couldn't be burned satisfactorily in the smaller furnace, in favour of the older low- pressure wagon boiler and its large grate. The difficulties of the Cornish boiler were that a boiler of any particular power would require a known area of furnace tube as the heating area. Longer tubes required a longer and more expensive boiler shell. They also reduced the ratio of grate area relative to the heating area, making it difficult to maintain an adequate fire. Increasing the tube diameter reduced the depth of water covering the furnace tube and so increased the need for accurate control of water level by the fireman, or else the risk of boiler explosion. Fairbairn's studies of hoop stress in cylinders also showed that smaller tubes were stronger than larger tubes. His solution was simple: to replace one large furnace tube with two smaller ones. The patent showed another advantage of twin furnaces. By firing them alternately and closing the firebox door between firings, it was also possible to arrange a supply of air past the furnace (in the case of a Lancashire boiler, through the ashpan beneath the grate) which would encourage the flue gases produced by the fire to burn more completely and cleanly, thus reducing smoke and pollution. A key factor in this was the distinctive shuttered rotating air damper in the door, which became a feature from the 1840s. The use of two flues also has a strengthening effect, acting as two long rod stays that support the end plates. Later developments added Galloway tubes (after their inventor, patented in either 1848 or 1851) crosswise water tubes across the flue, thus increasing the heated surface area. As these are short tubes of large diameter and the boiler continues to use a relatively low pressure, this is still not considered to be a water-tube boiler. The tubes are tapered, simply to make their installation through the flue easier. Lancashire boilers often show corrugated flues, which absorb thermal expansion without straining the riveted seams. Another development was the \\"kidney flue\\" or Galloway boiler, where the two furnaces join together into a single flue, kidney-shaped in cross-section. This widened and flat-topped flue was stayed by the use of Galloway tubes. Although the Lancashire boiler is considered to be an antiquated design, provided that the flue is long enough it can be reasonably efficient. This does lead to a bulky boiler though, particularly for its length, and this has always limited its use to stationary installations. It was the standard boiler in Greater Manchester and Lancashire cotton mills. == Fairbairn's five-tube boiler == Fairbairn five-tube boiler, end section William Fairbairn's work on the Lancashire boiler had demonstrated the efficiency virtues of multiple furnaces relative to a reduced water volume. It was also widely understood that higher steam pressures improved the efficiency of engines. Fairbairn's research on the strength of cylinders led him to design another improved boiler, based around far-smaller tube diameters, which would thus be able to operate at higher pressures, typically . This was the \\"five tube\\" boiler, whose five tubes were arranged in two nested pairs as water drum and furnace, with the remaining tube mounted above them as a separate steam drum. The water volume was extremely low compared to previous boiler designs, as the furnace tubes almost filled each of the water drums. The boiler was successful according to its goals and provided two large furnaces in a small water capacity. The separate steam drum also aided the production of \\"dry\\" steam, without the carryover of water and risk of priming. However it was also complex to manufacture, and did not offer a great deal of heating area for the work involved. It was soon superseded by multi-tube boilers such as the Fairbairn-Beeley and the Scotch boilers. ==See also== * Scotch marine boiler == Further reading == * * ==References== Category:Early steam locomotives Category:Fire-tube boilers ","title":"Flued boiler"},{"id":"20391585","text":"Reinhard Eiben (born 4 December 1951) is a retired East German slalom canoeist who won an individual gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.

Latham was born in Wolverhampton. After studying classical ballet for nine years she took a scholarship to the Royal Ballet School. A dancing competition led to a request for her to model for retailer Miss Selfridge. This consequently drew her into the world of modeling and television commercials where she became an instant success. She appeared on Page 3 of The Sun and in the Daily Mirror and built a huge following as a glamour model. In 1978, ATV made a documentary about her called \\"A Model's Dream\\" in the series England, Their England. After a shoot with leading glamour photographer Patrick Lichfield, he was so impressed with her that he included her photo on the inside front cover of his book The Most Beautiful Women, a collection of his photographs. In 1979, major men's magazines Playboy and Penthouse waged a very publicised battle over her for the first nude pictures. Latham signed a contract with Bob Guccione and Penthouse which promised a fee of ¬£70,000 for her to appear in the 10th Anniversary edition. Latham adorned nineteen pages of the magazine. That edition made U.S. history, selling more in dollar percentage than any other magazine to date and making a profit of $18 million. After a brief affair with Guccione, Latham's contract was terminated with Penthouse when she fell in love with Guccione's son. She moved from New York to Los Angeles and briefly became the girlfriend of Hugh Hefner living in the Playboy Mansion. In the early 1980s Latham returned to England to her Midland home in the village of Tettenhall. Latham was featured on the cover of Death Penalty, the debut album by the heavy metal band Witchfinder General. It was released in 1982. She also featured on the cover of Friends of Hell, their second album released in 1983. In 1982, Latham was involved in a serious car accident, after which she gave up modelling to open the first 'workout' keep- fit studio in the UK. Her daughter, Elizablue Nairi, was born in southern Spain in June 1985. In later years, she studied drama at Birmingham Repertory Theatre, working under a director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and went on to play the lead role in a government-funded film for the arts. In 1999, Latham became a teacher of yoga training at the Sivananda Yoga Vendanta Centre in Nassau, Bahamas. Since then, she has continued working in the healing arts. Despite several offers, she has refused to write her biography. She has set up her own charity with her daughter 'Blue', who is also a teacher of yoga. ==References== Category:Penthouse Pets Category:Page 3 girls Category:English female adult models Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:Living people Category:1960 births Category:People educated at the Royal Ballet School ","title":"Joanne Latham"},{"id":"20391628","text":"Linda Douglas may refer to: * Linda Douglas (1928‚Äì2017), actress and wife of Hank Greenberg * Linda Douglass, director of communications for the White House Office of Health Reform * Linda Douglas (gymnast) (born 1965), Australian rhythmic gymnast ","title":"Linda Douglas (disambiguation)"},{"id":"20391632","text":"Rudolph Charles (1 October 1938 ‚Äì 29 March 1985) was a musician and instrument maker of the Steelpan, but most notably, he was a pioneer and leader of the steelband movement in Trinidad and Tobago.

He used songwriting as a form of therapy to overcome this, putting his feelings and thoughts to words as one normally would do in a diary, but instead of lying hidden in a drawer somewhere, his secrets are literally on display. Since his songwriting was derived from these personal experiences, the lyrics are rather direct. Christensen says, \\"I simply think it was written in a simple and straightforward way, almost bordering to banal.\\"Tuxen, Henrik (2003). \\"P√• gr√¶nsen af det banale\\" (Bordering to banal).

The album was \\"decidedly a solo record\\" but the process was also markedly different, explained by Christensen as follows: \\"This was the first time I was without sparring partners, and I would definitely have bounced some things off of them. At the same time, I went into the studio without completed arrangements, unlike with Dizzy Mizz Lizzy where everything was pre-arranged and there was simply not a single strophe that we did not know of how they should be played.\\" This also meant more time was spent in the studio, in total nearly four months. == Reception == The album was successful in Denmark,\\"Cd'er p√• vej\\" (CDs along the way).

Christensen says, \\"There are really many who have responded to Secrets On Parade that it was almost therapeutic for them.\\" He thinks this is because the lyrics cover the topics so explicitly: \\"When someone finds himself in a depressed state, I think that very direct words penetrate through much easier.

About the genesis of this song, Christensen explains that this was originally written as a heavy song, but it didn't really work. This version is frequently played as the shorter song \\"Screaming At the Top of My Lungs\\". The song was then recorded as a quiet ballad, but this too did not feel right.

This was intended to provide members of each social class with an education befitting their expected future status‚Äîtoil or leadership. Children of the working class have a different educational experience than children of the middle and upper classes. Because of this, working class children can start out life at a disadvantage. Their educational experience may be hindered for several reasons, including influences from their parents, the schools they attend, and their expectations and attitudes, all of which are strongly affected by previous generations The interaction between low class learning and more high class used to be identified and only available for the people who weren't of low class the treatment. among the two each was very different and only taken seriously if they were known as being superior. The classrooms were used to make the children from low classes believe that, because they come from low standards they weren't as good as their peers. Children who went to school for education weren‚Äôt coming out with the proper variety they needed to be successful. The higher class was known as elite and their education was advanced and gifted. They were in charge scholastically and anyone under them was not receiving the same social or academic opportunity. Overall education has been used to keep the social order and academic order for the superior or elite students rather than all students. ==Schools== The schools in the lower income districts are characterized by overcrowding and lack of resources. This is because the funding of American public schools comes mostly from their district's property taxes. Residential segregation occurs when people segregate themselves based on class and race. This leaves schools in the low income school districts with little because those who are capable of paying higher property taxes move to districts where there are higher taxes and schools are receiving more. For example, in New York City, where efforts are being made to level the playing field, students in the wealthiest school districts are given almost twice as much as students in the poorest district, an annual amount of $13,974 compared to $7,457. When schools lack funding, programs such as special education classes and extracurricular activities are cut back. This causes some working class children to not get the attention and help they require. When schools and teachers are not receiving the goods required to fulfill their duty, students cannot be expected to display the motivation to learn in a flawed system. ==Parental influences== The way parents act in the home and raise their children has a large effect on how children will interact in social institutions. Many social scientists claim that middle class parents practice concerted cultivation, meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults. Due to the extent of their interactions outside of the home, the children of concerted cultivation develop a greater mastery of language and are instilled with a sense of entitlement, both of which allows them to become more comfortable when interacting with institutions.Lareau, Annette. Unequal Childhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. On the other hand, many working-class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home. These children are usually left to occupy themselves with activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or playing outside. Working-class parents put less emphasis on planned activities, than their middle class counterparts, because they are less likely to have the funds to pay for them.Doob, Christopher Bates. \\"Working-Class Development.\\" Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2013. N. pag. Print. The problem that comes with these differences in parenting practices is that schools, along with other institutions, are more harmonious with concerted cultivation, the parenting practice of the middle class. Teachers want parents and children to engage and be proactive, but parents and children of the working class feel a sense of constraint that leaves them confused on how to \\"work the system\\" and often causes them to become hostile towards schooling.Russo, John and Sherry Linkon. New Working-Class Studies. Ithaca: ILR Press, 2005. Because working-class parents are often uncomfortable around authority figures, they are less likely to communicate with their child's teacher or become involved in the school. As a result of this, low income school districts have lower involvement in parent teacher conferences.Shipler, David. The Working Poor. New York: Knopf, 2004. This could also be attributed to the fact that working- class parents often have to hold down more than one job and do not have very much time to help their children with homework or attend school functions. As a consequence, working-class children mature in narrow social settings, receive fewer resources, and feel less entitlement. ==Attitudes== The children of the working class approach school with a different attitude than those of higher class. This is because their sense of entitlement is lower than that of their middle class counterparts. Working-class students sometimes feel unentitled or that they do not belong in affluent high schools or colleges. Instead of viewing education as a way up in the world, the working class views it as valuable but not as a reality for them.Payne, Ruby. Framework for Understanding Poverty. Highlands, TX: Aha Process Inc, 2001. For working-class parents, they are more consumed with the tasks of simply getting by and providing for their children than they are with good grades and higher education. Parents pass this survival mentality onto their children and cause a cycle where working class children do not have the same aspirations instilled in them that the middle class does. Only 54% of students whose parents only received their high school diploma go on to pursue their bachelor's degree. This statistic is compared to the 82% of students whose parents received their bachelor's degree that go on to college. First generation students who do on go to college experience a culture shock once they get there because they are not as comfortable and sure of themselves as those that have come from a family that has received higher education. A 2012 reviewRubin,M. (2012). Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research. Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, 5, 22-38. doi: 10.1037/a0026162 of the literature has shown that working-class students have a greater risk of being excluded from social life at universities, including formal activities such as campus-based clubs, societies, and organizations and informal activities such as parties and nonclassroom conversations. This is an important problem because social integration predicts student retention, and working class students are twice as likely as middle class students to drop out before their second year of college because they lack the persistence they need to face challenges and succeed in college. The attitude of children born into the working class strongly reflects the way their parents raise them. The outlook and importance of education is not the same as families with wealth. Inheritance plays a strong role in the way parents and children view and value education. ==Solving the problem== There are some ways that this may be changed. In order to break this cycle, working class students might be taught the values of the middle class or the schooling system develop programs that help those students that are not receiving the support and guidance they need from home. The middle class values are the same values that are felt by the authority figures at school; therefore, through teaching working class students to value education and be more involved they will be able to navigate social institutions with greater purpose and poise. The problem could be that working-class parents did not have these values instilled in them; therefore, they are less likely to pass these values on to their children. Schools have been left with the responsibility of being the only places for some children to learn the rules and values that are present in most institutions. Solving the problem of racism within these institutions, causing perpetual problems and nearly impossible change, would take large steps towards rectifying problems within the education system. As long as institutionalized racism exists, problems within the educational system will continue to exist. Due to the lack of resources in needy schools, educational facilities are forced to develop support systems that do not have any additional costs. Programs that have been introduced into lower income schools include the following: * A specified amount of time set aside every day for homework can help the child better understand. Often working-class parents have neither the time nor the knowledge to help their children with their homework. By providing time for homework during the school day, students who are not receiving the help they need at home are able to receive supplemental instruction. * Keeping the same teachers for a few years or having separate schools within schools can strengthen relationships. This program allows children and parents to become more familiar with teachers and to form stronger bonds.

The band's line-up has been constant since its founding, consisting of Thom Yorke (vocals and guitar), Jonny Greenwood (guitar), Ed O'Brien (guitar), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar), and Phil Selway (drums). The role that each band member plays during performances has changed dramatically throughout the band's history. Drummer and percussionist Clive Deamer has joined Radiohead for performances since the release of their 2011 album The King of Limbs. Radiohead formed under the name On a Friday in 1986 and performed shows in the Oxford area under this name until 1991. They toured extensively across the United States and Europe in support of their debut album, Pablo Honey and their performances were credited for the success of Pablo Honey and their debut single \\"Creep\\". Radiohead toured widely in support of The Bends and its singles. ==HistoryOn a Friday (1985‚Äì1991)=== Radiohead's first incarnation was called On a Friday, founded in 1985 while the members were all attending the public boys-only Abingdon School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Thom Yorke was on vocals and guitar, Colin Greenwood played bass guitar, Ed O'Brien played rhythm guitar, and Phil Selway played drums. Future guitarist Jonny Greenwood played harmonica as a guest member at these shows,Randall, p. 34 and later keyboards as a permanent member.Randall, p. 43 The band would also feature three saxophone players in their live show until the late 1980s.Randall, p. 30 Colin Greenwood later said that, during the band's earliest live performances, \\"We wore all black and played very loud, because we thought that's what you had to do.\\"(1998) Interview Picture Disc. Baktabak (4115). The band's early gigs took place at various parties around town, rather than concerts. The band members split up to attend university, but reunited during breaks for rehearsals and occasional performances.Randall, p. 37 On a Friday's first concert in a conventional venue was at the Jericho Tavern in Jericho, Oxford, in 1987; the performance had few attendants and was negatively received by participants in the local music scene.Randall, p. 41 On a Friday fully resumed in 1991, and Jonny Greenwood's role in the group changed to third guitarist.Randall, p. 54 Shoegazing bands such as Ride and Swervedriver were a prominent local trend, one which On a Friday did not fit into. The band's first reunited show was at the Hollybush in Osney on 22 July 1991. Although the band played to an audience of only six people, they were well received. According to Radiohead biographer Mac Randall, \\"Yorke's dramatic singing style and frighteningly intense onstage demeanor‚Äîone moment tightly focused, the next seemingly ready to burst open‚Äîwas already coming to the fore\\", and the band played in a garage rock style. O'Brien spread the band's three-song demo Dungeon Demo around the community, which earned the band a number of gigs, mostly at the Jericho Tavern. Members of the band would also occasionally busk.Randall, pp. 57‚Äì59 Producer Chris Hufford attended an On a Friday show at the Jericho Tavern on 8 August 1991, and later described the band as \\"a lot rougher, a lot punkier, quite frenetic and [playing at] a faster tempo [than they would play at later].\\"St. Michael, p. 9 Hufford was so impressed by the performance that he had the band record a new demo, Manic Hedgehog, at his Courtyard Studios. Shortly afterward, the band signed to EMI and changed their names to Radiohead. By the time of the signing, the band had dropped some of their older songs off of concert set lists.St. Michael, p. 24 Radiohead played fewer than ten shows in 1991. ===Pablo Honey era (1992‚Äì1993)=== The band's first tour began in April 1992, supporting Catherine Wheel. Because of a two-week delay of their debut extended play, Drill, Radiohead had no music on sale to promote. Despite challenges the band faced adapting to regular touring, their performances were generally well received by audiences.Randall, pp. 79‚Äì80 After the recording sessions for Radiohead's debut studio album Pablo Honey, the band toured in support of The Frank and Walters until mid-October 1992. The band then toured with Kingmaker, opening for a juggler before the main band came on. During this tour, Yorke would randomly cut off clumps of his hair, and frequently became heavily intoxicated on alcohol, often to the point where the band would have to cancel shows. Yorke would later attribute this behavior his frustrations with the band's perceived directionless in defining themselves.St. Michael, p. 25 In 1992, the band played over 100 shows across most of the United Kingdom. The year ended with a highly negative review of Radiohead's live show in the NME, in which writer Keith Cameron wrote \\"Radiohead are a pitiful, lily-livered excuse for a rock 'n' roll group.\\"Hale, p. 50 Radiohead played a few dates in the UK in January 1993.Randall, p. 92 On the strength of the band's new single \\"Creep\\" in Israel, the band played three shows in Tel Aviv in March 1993, where they found wide recognition for the first time.Randall, p. 108‚Äì109 After returning from Tel Aviv they played a number of dates in the UK, and also played at the Bevrijdingspop Festival in Haarlem, the band's first concert in the Netherlands.Randall, p. 111 Around this time, Radiohead became known for their violent performances; the guitarists regularly cut open their fingers with the instruments, and Yorke once gashed his head on his guitar. Yorke said that \\"there's always loads of blood on the guitars at the end of the night. 'Performance' for us means we don't know what we're going to do.\\"(1998) Radiohead: The Interview. Talking Music (SPEEK004). Radiohead's first tour in the United States and Canada, starting on 22 July 1993, took place over the course of a month in clubs in Boston, New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Toronto, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Dallas. This tour was, like the tour in Israel, made possible due to the growing popularity of \\"Creep\\". Radiohead performed live on television for the first time, on The Arsenio Hall Show followed by an appearance on the MTV show Beach Party. The band also played at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California, and although the show sold out in 20 minutes the band considered the performance to be a failure.Randall, pp. 113‚Äì114 The US tour was considered a success, credited for placing \\"Creep\\" at its peak of number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100, placing Pablo Honey at number 32 on the Billboard 200, and for pushing Pablo Honey to a Gold RIAA certification for shipping 500,000 units.Randall, p. 115 Yorke, however, had mixed feelings about the tour, and later said that \\"Our so-called success in America... allowed us to do a lot of things, but it also meant that somehow we owed somebody something.\\"Doyle, Tom. \\"Party On!\\". Q. June 1997. In August, the band played at a festival in Belgium and two in the Netherlands. The band canceled an appearance at the Reading Festival because of Yorke's stress-induced laryngitis.Randall, p. 116 EMI reissued \\"Creep\\" in the UK, and it charted at number seven, prompting an appearance by the band on Top of the Pops. Although Capitol Records had wanted Radiohead to tour again in the US with labelmates Duran Duran, Hufford convinced the label otherwise, and Radiohead returned to the US for a month- long tour supporting Belly. On this tour, Radiohead played at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia.Randall, p. 118 A performance on this tour received a mixed response from Chicago Sun-Times writer Jae-Ha Kim, who criticized Yorke's singing voice but wrote that \\"Jonny Greenwood's fuzzy guitar playing was authoritative, dictating the mopey melodies and complementing Ed O'Brien's rhythm guitars.\\"Kim, Jae-Ha. \\"Belly Rocks; Radiohead Rolls Over\\". Chicago Sun- Times. 18 October 1993. After the Belly tour ended, Radiohead played a frustrating show at the Aladdin Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada opening for Tears for Fears. Radiohead finished in the US and toured in Canada, playing in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto. Yorke told a newspaper reporter while in Canada that \\"I think so far we've played 350 dates in support of this album in Europe and North America. That's a hell of a lot of miles.\\"\\"Radiohead is Touring Till it Drops\\". Toronto Star. 30 October 1993. The band then played a tour backing James, taking place across Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and the UK. During this final tour, conflict among the band increased. Exhaustion from touring, Yorke's egotism, and frustration from repeatedly playing \\"Creep\\" all contributed to the band's in-fighting. The tour was nearly canceled, but during a meeting the band members decided against it. According to band agent Charlie Myatt, the band \\"played like demons\\" during the final segment of the James tour.Irvin, Jim; Hoskyns, Barney. \\"We Have Lift-Off\\". Mojo. September 1997. Touring ended on 13 December 1993, and the band members took a break.Randall, p. 119‚Äì121 Jonny Greenwood summarized the previous year of touring by saying \\"We joined this band to write songs and be musicians, but we spend a year being jukeboxes instead.\\" ===My Iron Lung (1994)=== Radiohead returned to touring in May 1994. The touring schedule had dates in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand. The tour found the band in the middle of fruitless sessions for their upcoming album, The Bends, so performing live was considered a welcome change. The band introduced many of the new songs from The Bends for the first time, though \\"Creep\\" was still a crowd favorite.Randall pp. 130‚Äì131 Radiohead performed at Manchester University, and Yorke expressed anxiety about possible negative reception due to the band's cancellation of their appearance at Reading Festival the year prior, saying to the audience \\"I was scared shitless about tonight.\\"St. Michael, p. 59 During the concert, Yorke damaged his left ankle and suffered a stress fracture, an injury which required a brace but did not delay the tour. A performance by the band at the London Astoria was recorded and frequently broadcast by MTV Europe. The audio from the same show from the song \\"My Iron Lung\\" would be used as the recording for The Bends, albeit with a re-recorded vocal.Randall, p. 132 While in the UK, Jonny Greenwood was diagnosed with repetitive strain injury in his right arm from his rapid guitar playing, and was required to wear a brace. Greenwood continued to wear the brace well past the point where it was necessary as a sort of trademark, saying \\"It's like taping up your fingers before a boxing match. It's a ritual.\\" By the time the band had returned from the tour, they found recording easier, leading producer John Leckie to comment \\"I think it helped that they'd been on tour because they had confidence in a lot of the songs again, which I think they'd maybe lost during that lengthy recording period.\\"Doyle, Tom. \\"Diary of an LP\\". Melody Maker. 22 April 1995. The band played at a number of summer festivals, including appearances at Glastonbury Festival, Roskilde in Denmark and the Sopot Marlboro Rock Festival in Poland. The band agreed that their most important performance that summer, and the one they were most nervous about, was Reading Festival. However, reception at the festival was positive, though Hufford felt the band put too much unfamiliar material in their set.Randall, pp. 134‚Äì135 The band played a ten-date tour in the UK from 27 September to 8 October in support of the recently released \\"My Iron Lung\\" single, including a performance for the Oxfam Rwandan Relief Fund. The band raised ¬£7,000 in support of victims of the Rwandan genocide, and a review of the show by Ian Watson Melody Maker noted that, while \\"Creep\\" was \\"naturally\\" the \\"pinnacle\\" of the show, new songs like \\"My Iron Lung\\", \\"Just\\", and \\"Black Star\\" were also highlights.Watson, Ian. \\"Jail Strippers\\". Melody Maker. 8 October 1994. The UK shows were followed by two concerts in Bangkok and an eight-date tour of Mexico.Randall, p. 141 During the Mexican tour, the band members had a number of emotional outbursts; as O'Brian described it, \\"Things had been brewing and they basically came to a head.\\"Richardson, Andy. \\"Boom! Shake the Gloom\\". NME. 5 December 1995. Following the tour in Mexico, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood played a number of shows in the US by themselves with only acoustic instruments,Randall, p. 143 a format which was soon repeated for four shows in England before the release of the \\"High and Dry\\"/\\"Planet Telex\\" single.Randall, p. 144 Radiohead played a gig with Supergrass and the Candyskins at the Apollo Theatre for an audience of journalists and EMI executives, a performance which garnered praise from Melody Maker. The band also played at a benefit for and at the Venue, a club they had frequented while still called On a Friday. The Venue and much of the local Oxford music scene were unable to continue business; due to Radiohead's concert, the Venue survived, and the club is now renamed The Zodiac.Randall, p. 145 ===The Bends (1995)=== The Bends was released on 13 March 1995. Radiohead toured in the UK from February to late March in support of The Bends. Audience reception was overwhelmingly positive, and many of the dates were sold out. One date on the tour, at Sheffield, was canceled due to Yorke contracting a stomach flu.Randall, p. 173 The band went on to perform in Japan and North America; Radiohead would cross the US six times in promotion of The Bends.Randall, p. 174 Yorke and Jonny Greenwood also played a number of new acoustic sets, though Greenwood stated around this time that \\"We do hate this acoustic thing. It's evil, the idea.\\"Garcia, Sandra A. \\"Radiohead: Decompression\\". B-Side. July/August 1995. By the time the US tour for The Bends officially began, Yorke had a build-up of fluid in his ears from his regular airplane flying, which worried him that he was going deaf. On the debut show of the tour in Boston, Yorke lashed out at moshers in the crowd, yelling and hitting one with his guitar. On 29 May, Yorke had a \\"breakdown\\" and begged tour manager Tim Greaves to book him a flight back to England.Dawn, Randee. \\"Modulation Across the Nation\\". Alternative Press. October 1995. Other members of the band were also suffering from stress and fatigue, with O'Brien noting \\"We had two weeks off last year [in 1994], and we've been together every single day since January this year.\\" In spite of Radiohead's touring, The Bends did not perform as well as Pablo Honey in the US, though it reached the top ten charts in the UK.Randall, p. 176‚Äì177 In July, R.E.M. chose Radiohead as the opening act for the European leg of its Monster tour, a decision made because the members of R.E.M. were fans of The Bends but had never heard Radiohead live. R.E.M. was an early and lasting influence on Radiohead, and during the tour the two bands shared admiration.Randall, p. 177‚Äì178 Yorke wrote, after Michael Stipe revealed himself to be a Radiohead fan, that \\"I've never believed in hero worship but I have to admit to myself that i'm fighting for breath.\\"Yorke, Thom. \\"That's Me in the Corner\\". Q. October 1995. Jonny Greenwood similarly felt that \\"It's been exciting and embarrassing, them watching us from the wings every night. It's enormously surreal.\\"Orr, Jay. \\"Radiohead finds opening for R.E.M. 'enormously surreal'\\". The Nashville Banner. 11 September 1995. Stipe stated during a concert with Radiohead in Tel Aviv that \\"There aren't many things that scare me, but Radiohead are so good they scare me.\\"Randall, p. 179 By August Radiohead were playing on their own again in Europe, debuting a number of new songs including \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" and \\"Lucky\\".Randall, p. 176, 181 Radiohead played a short number of dates opening for both R.E.M. and Soul Asylum in the US, before returning to the UK and Europe for more touring. More physical ailments afflicted the band, as Greenwood suffered hearing problems and needed to wear soundproof headphones and Yorke began losing his voice.Randall, p. 185 On top of this, all of the band's gear was stolen, cancelling a number of shows.Randall, p. 184 These problems culminated with Yorke fainting on stage, an event characterized in the NME as a \\"temper tantrum\\". By December 1995 and January 1996, the band had stopped touring and returned home.Randall, p. 186 ===OK Computer and Against Demons tour (1996‚Äì1998)=== Radiohead resumed touring in the US in March 1996. EMI, encouraged by the high ranking of The Bends in many year-end best-of lists, began a new marketing push in the US. With the combined force of EMI's renewed efforts and Radiohead's constant touring, the album reentered the Billboard charts, peaked at number 88, and was certified gold.Randall, p. 194 The band appeared on both The Tonight Show, which Yorke described as \\"the highlight of our entire fucking year\\", and 120 Minutes. New songs had an increasing presence on set lists for this tour. Among these were ones that would be on the band's third album OK Computer, such as \\"No Surprises\\", \\"Let Down\\", and \\"Electioneering\\".Randall, p. 191 The tour also found Yorke more willing to exercise restraint in his vocals and onstage mannerisms, and Greenwood more willing to improvise on established songs.Randall, p. 192 The band played at Pinkpop Festival and Rock Werchter. Jae-Ha Kim wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, reviewing a performance by Radiohead at Metro Chicago, that their \\"intense touring schedule (more than 110 dates in America alone) has transformed it from a good live group into a great one.\\"Kim, Jae-Ha. \\"Matur√≠ng Into Greatness\\". Chicago Sun-Times. 4 May 1996. In a review of the T in the Park festival, the NME called Radiohead \\"The Last Great Sincere Rock Band\\".St. Michael, p. 99 The band supported Alanis Morissette for 13 dates of her Jagged Little Pill tour. They used the opportunity to hone their new material, including \\"Paranoid Android\\", a multisectioned song that then stretched to over 14 minutes.Randall, p. 197\\"Thom Yorke loves to skank\\". Q. 12 August 2002. In spite of Radiohead's sound being markedly different from that of Morissette, the audience reaction was \\"tremendous\\", according to Mac Randall. Capitol employee Clark Staub said, \\"If they'd been allowed an encore, Radiohead would have got an encore.\\"Randall, p. 196 \\"It was silly money and it gave us a chance to work out everything live,\\" Colin Greenwood recalled. \\"That, and the strangely perverse kick out of being these five men in black, scaring prepubescent American girls with our own brand of dark music.\\"Moran, Caitlin. \\"Everything Was Just Fear\\". Select. July 1997. Between recording sessions for OK Computer, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood played a secret gig for Dazed & Confused magazine, performing three songs from The Bends and four new songs.Randall, pp. 198‚Äì199 The band performed a preview of OK Computer in Lisbon in mid-May, and marked the beginning of the Against Demons tour at the album's \\"launch\\" on 22 May and 24 May in Barcelona.Randall, pp. 202‚Äì203 The set list for the first Barcelona show, at the Zeleste Club, included nearly every song on OK Computer, several from The Bends, and only \\"You\\" from Pablo Honey. The show, which had three encores, garnered positive reception in a review in Mojo.Randall, p. 241 After the Barcelona shows, the members were already showing signs of stress and exhaustion; particularly Yorke, whose mood and conduct during interviews ranged from relaxed to highly irritable.Randall, p. 242 Starting in Barcelona, the band's performances and other promotional activities on the tour were filmed by Grant Gee. ===Kid A and Amnesiac era (1999‚Äì2001)=== In mid-2000, Radiohead toured the Mediterranean, performing Kid A and Amnesiac songs for the first time. Later that year, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos, playing mostly new songs. They also performed three concerts in North American theatres, their first in nearly three years. The small venues sold out rapidly, attracting celebrities, and fans who camped overnight. In October, Radiohead performed on the American comedy show Saturday Night Live; the performance shocked some viewers expecting rock songs, with Jonny Greenwood playing electronic instruments, the house brass band improvising over \\"The National Anthem\\", and Yorke dancing erratically to \\"Idioteque\\". The Amnesiac tour began in June 2001, incorporating Radiohead's first North American tour in three years. In November 2001, Radiohead released a live EP, I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, comprising recordings from the Kid A and Amnesiac tours. ===In Rainbows (2005‚Äì2009)=== Radiohead began touring again in 2006, the first gig being in Copenhagen on 6 May. This tour was about the band \\"getting back into\\" the momentum of playing songs and recording after a year's hiatus in 2004. Many new songs that would later appear on In Rainbows were roadtested on this tour, notably Videotape at the Hammersmith Apollo gig on 15 May. Other songs that made their debut on this tour were; \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\" (under the working title \\"Open Pick\\"), \\"Videotape\\", \\"15 Step\\", \\"Bodysnatchers\\", \\"All I Need\\" and some B-sides, such as \\"Bangers+Mash\\" and \\"Last Flowers\\". \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" was also played, as was \\"Nude\\", although both of these songs dated back to before the 2006 tour. The tour is notable as these versions of the songs were often very different from the eventual In Rainbows incarnations. Radiohead also played the V Festival, as well as gigs throughout Europe, the UK, Canada and the USA. The In Rainbows tour started in May 2008 in the US, continued in Europe, returned to the US and Canada. After this the band performed in Japan in October, finishing the first half of the tour. The tour continued in 2009 starting in Latin America with Kraftwerk as guests.\\"Tour dates\\" . radiohead.com. Radiohead returned to Mexico for first time since 1994 with two concerts on 15 and 16 March, and had their debut live performance in Brazil, Argentina and Chile in March 2009. Concerts were held in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo on the 20th and 22nd, Buenos Aires on the 24th, and two were held in Santiago, on the 26th and 27th. ===The King of Limbs (2010‚Äì2012)=== Radiohead did not perform The King of Limbs live until several months after its release, as Yorke wanted to continue studio work and it took some time to arrange the album for performance. To perform the complex rhythms, they enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, who had worked with Portishead and Get the Blessing. Selway said: \\"That was fascinating. One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at play, really interesting.\\" Deamer has joined Radiohead for subsequent tours. Radiohead performed The King of Limbs in its entirety for The King of Limbs: Live from the Basement, broadcast in July 2011 and released on DVD and Blu-ray in December 2011. On 24 June 2011, Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, performing songs from The King of Limbs before an audience for the first time.[106] In September, they played two dates at New York City's Roseland Ballroom and made American TV appearances including a one-hour special episode of The Colbert Report and the season premiere of Saturday Night Live. In 2012, Radiohead toured Europe, North America, and Asia, with appearances at the Bonnaroo, Coachella and Fuji Rock festivals. They played mainly arenas, as O'Brien said the \\"precise and detailed\\" King of Limbs material would not suit outdoor venues. On 16 June 2012, the stage collapsed during the setup for a show at Toronto's Downsview Park, killing drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three other members of Radiohead's road crew. The show was canceled and Radiohead's tour dates in Europe were postponed. After rescheduling the tour, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson and their stage crew at their next concert, in N√Æmes, France, in July. In 2013, Live Nation Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges. Following a delay caused by mistrial, the case was dropped in 2017 under the Jordan ruling, which puts time limits on cases. A 2019 inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. ===A Moon Shaped Pool tour (2016‚Äì2017) === On 14 March 2016, six days after releasing their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, Radiohead announced a world tour, joined again by Deamer. The tour began on 20 May 2016 at the Heineken Music Hall, during which Radiohead debuted nine of eleven tracks from AMSP; \\"Glass Eyes\\" and \\"True Love Waits\\" were debuted at later shows. The tour saw the returns of \\"Creep\\" and \\"Let Down\\", which had not been played for seven and ten years respectively. The final show took place on 7 October at Austin City Limits, Yorke's 48th birthday, and ended fan favourite \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\". On 31 October, the band confirmed a 2017 tour by adding a list of European tour dates to their website. They began a second US tour in March 2017, culminating in a headline slot at the April 2017 Coachella festival in California marred by technical problems. A European tour followed in June and July with several festival shows, including Radiohead's third headline performance at Glastonbury Festival in the UK. In 2018, Radiohead toured North and South America from April to August, including four nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City, with Jonny Greenwood's project Junun as the support act. It was the 61st-highest-grossing tour of 2018, earning over US$28 million. The Moon Shaped Pool tour included a performance in Tel Aviv on 19 July 2017, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. The decision was criticised by artists including musician Roger Waters and filmmaker Ken Loach, and a petition urging Radiohead to cancel it was signed by more than 50 prominent figures. Yorke responded in a statement: \\"Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.\\" ==Live recordings== Grant Gee's footage from the Against Demons tour was used in the rockumentary Meeting People Is Easy, released in 1998.Randall, p. 238 An article in Q claimed that, according to Yorke, Meeting People Is Easy is \\"a 94-minute message to any younger bands who might envy Radiohead's high-flying lifestyle. And that message is: 'Don't even think about it.'\\"Eccleston, Danny. Article on Radiohead. Q. October 2000. A recording of a 1994 performance at the London Astoria was released and is still available on DVD. There is also an EP featuring performances of songs from their 2001 tour called I Might Be Wrong. More recently, Radiohead recorded a concert from their In Rainbows tour for NPR's All Songs Considered webcast hosted by Bob Boilen. This concert is available for free streaming on NPR's website and for free download as a podcast on iTunes. The band has performed concerts for the MTV Network twice; once in 1997 for the Live from the 10 Spot series and once in 2003 for MTV2's $2 Bill series. The latter concert was also shown in its full length in Canadian movie theaters. They also performed live for the German concert series Rockpalast in June 2001 during their Kid A/Amnesiac tour. The concert was bootlegged and released unofficially on DVD in 2007. ==References== * * * ==Footnotes * thomthomthom.com Radiohead gigography * Gigography at Greenplastic.com * Radiohead Live Tour Dates Live Performances Category:Lists of concert tours ","title":"List of Radiohead live performances"},{"id":"20392148","text":"Home Is the Exile is a novel by the American writer Hilary Masters set in 1990s Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The unenforceable part having been excised, the remainder of the agreement was valid, and served to establish that the MOU agreement was not intended by the parties to be binding at law. ==In other jurisdictions== In most jurisdictions, courts routinely \\"blue pencil\\" or reform covenants that are not reasonable. The blue pencil doctrine gives courts the authority to either strike unreasonable clauses from a non-compete agreement, leaving the rest to be enforced, or actually modify the agreement to reflect the terms that the parties originally could have -- and probably should have -- agreed to. In Israel the blue pencil method has been used to strike out illegal or unconstitutional parts of a statute, leaving the rest intact.http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/12/460/071/b24/12071460.b24.htm Supreme Court decision regarding illegal aliens of 16 September 2013 ==See also== *Rectification (law) == References == Category:Common law Category:Legal doctrines and principles ","title":"Blue pencil doctrine"},{"id":"20392177","text":"Si Siman (January 17, 1921 - December 16, 1994), born Ely E.

He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1940 until his death in 1945. ==Biography== He was born on January 28, 1876 in New York City to Mayer Lehman (d. 1897) and Babette Newgass and raised Jewish. Future New York State governor and United States Senator Herbert H. Lehman was his brother. He graduated with an A.B. from Columbia College in 1896 and an LL.B. from Columbia University Law School in 1898. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1909 to 1923, elected in 1908 on the Democratic ticket, and re-elected in 1922 on the Democratic and Republican tickets. In 1923, he was elected on the Democratic and Republican tickets to a 14-year term on the New York Court of Appeals, and re-elected in 1937. In 1939, he was elected Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals on the Democratic, Republican and American Labor tickets, and remained on the bench until his death in office. In 1942 the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions of the notorious Louis Buchalter and his two associates Emanuel Weiss and Louis Capone under a sharply divided decision of the judges, who filed four opinions. The death sentences were upheld by a vote of 4-3. (People v. Buchalter, 289 N.Y. 181) However, Judge Lehman, who was also affirming the conviction of the three, expressed some doubts in the verdict and stated that the errors and defects in the case were in fact numerous. In 1943 the United States Supreme Court granted Buchalter's petition to review the case and in a full opinion affirmed the conviction, 7-0, with two justices abstaining. (319 U.S. 427 (1943)) Finally, Judge Lehman signed a show cause order in 1944 because the counsel for the trio had appeared before Governor Thomas E. Dewey in a clemency plea, and Lehman eventually delayed the execution of the condemned men. Even so, the clemency plea was denied by Governor Dewey. On March 4, 1944 Emanuel Weiss thanked Chief Judge Lehman in his final words before being electrocuted in Sing Sing. ==Personal life== On June 26, 1901, he married Sissie Straus, the daughter of Nathan Straus, American merchant and philanthropist who co-owned two of New York City's biggest department stores, R.H. Macy & Company and Abraham & Straus. The couple was childless.HISTORICAL SOCIETY of the NEW YORK COURTS: \\"IRVING LEHMAN (1876-1945) - Court of Appeals: 1924-1945\\" by Henry M.

It was launched in 1981, with a recommended retail price of ¬£49.95. The ZX Printer used special wide black paper which was supplied coated with a thin layer of aluminium. To mark the paper, one of the printer's two styluses passed a current through a small area of the aluminium layer, causing the aluminium to evaporate and reveal the black under-surface. The printer's horizontal resolution was the same as the ZX81's video display, i.e. 256 dots (pixels) or 32 characters (using the standard character definition). The ZX Printer was also compatible with the earlier ZX80 computer (when fitted with the 8kB ROM upgrade) and the later ZX Spectrum, and plugged directly into the expansion bus connector via a short cable. The expansion bus was duplicated on the outside of the printer's connector, allowing other peripherals to be connected concurrently. The printer drew its power directly from the expansion bus, and was sold with a larger (1-2A) power supply for the ZX81 to accommodate the additional power drain., Sinclair User - Printers The Spectrum's user manual noted that this was not needed for the Spectrum as its default 1.1A power supply was sufficient. ==Competing printers== The Alphacom 32 was a thermal printer that used the same interface, and therefore could be driven by a ZX81 or Spectrum without additional software.ALPHACOM 32, USER‚ÄôS MANUAL, PUB NR.: 017121-01 Unlike the ZX Printer, it had a separate power supply. == References See also== * ZX Spectrum * Sinclair Research ==External Links== * Planet Sinclair: ZX Printer * Ian Adamson; Richard Kennedy.

He both introduced and played requests on the Royal organ. When it was axed, the resultant petition was said at the time to be the largest the BBC had ever encountered. ==Early life== Savage was born on 20 March 1920 near Penzance, in the village of Gulval. His mother played the organ there in the village church and taught him in their home how to play the piano. He moved on to study the organ under the instruction of organists at Truro Cathedral and with other instructors in Cornwall and Plymouth. ==Theatre organist and soldier== In 1938, as an 18-year-old, he was chosen as the organist for the ABC Royal Cinema in Plymouth which had been constructed that year and included a Compton theatre organ with eight ranks of pipes plus a Compton Melotone unit. With a break for military service, he remained at the ABC organ until the cinema was converted into a bingo hall in 1976.History, The Blackheath Halls Compton organ. Accessed 26 November 2008.

After the BBC cancelled the show following the 22 September 1968 broadcast, more than 43,000 signatures were collected on a petition submitted to the BBC, in addition to letters sent to the Chairman of Governors of the BBC and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The petition was submitted, accompanied by protesters carrying banners in what was described as \\"perhaps the biggest demonstration of its kind the BBC has known\\".James, Francis. \\"As Prescribed -- by public demand!\\", Radio Times, 19 December 1968.

It was published in 1832 by Mame-Delaunay as one of the Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e (Scenes of Private Life) in La Com√©die humaine. Later editions of the work were brought out by B√©chet in 1835 and by Charpentier in 1839, in both of which La Bourse was placed among the Sc√®nes de la vie parisienne (Scenes of Parisian Life). It was, however, restored to the Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e when Furne brought out the fourth and final edition in 1842; this heavily revised version of the story appeared as the third work in Volume 1 of La Com√©die humaine.Furne (1842‚Äì48). In the final version of La Com√©die humaine, La Bourse was the fourth of the Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e. ==Plot== Honor√© de Balzac The young painter Hippolyte Schinner falls from a step-ladder while working in his atelier and is knocked unconscious. The noise of his fall alerts two of his neighbours, Ad√©la√Øde Leseigneur and her mother Madame de Rouville, who occupy the apartment immediately below. The two women revive the young man and an acquaintance is struck up. Inevitably, the young painter falls in love with Ad√©la√Øde and over the following weeks he pays frequent visits to her apartment. There he is always warmly welcomed, but he cannot help noticing the unmistakable signs of poverty ‚Äì a poverty that the two women are at obvious pains to hide. Hippolyte's suspicions are aroused. The mother and her daughter have different surnames; they are reluctant to reveal anything of their past; and what is Hippolyte to make of the two old friends of the mother, the Comte de Kergarouet and the Chevalier du Halga, who regularly visit her to play cards for money, but who always lose to her as though on purpose? Hippolyte discovers that Madame de Rouville's late husband was a naval captain who died at Batavia from wounds received in an engagement with an English vessel. The Comte de Kergarouet, it transpires, is a former comrade of Baron de Rouville. Hippolyte offers to draw a portrait of Monsieur de Rouville, a fading sketch of whom is hanging in the apartment. Two months later, when the finished portrait is hung in Madame de Rouville's apartment, the Comte de Kergarouet offers Hippolyte 500 pistoles to have his own portrait painted in a similar style. Hippolyte, however, suspects that the old man is offering him the price of both portraits while paying for his own, and he declines the offer. Despite his suspicions that the two women make are living in some mysterious and disreputable manner, Hippolyte continues his visits, for he is deeply in love with Ad√©la√Øde. One day, as he is leaving the apartment, he realizes that he has left his purse behind; but when he returns and inquires about it, Ad√©la√Øde brazenly insists that no such purse has been left in their apartment. The young man suspects he has been robbed by the women and he stops visiting them. Over the following week he pines away. His colleagues seem to confirm his worst suspicions ‚Äì that Ad√©la√Øde is a prostitute and Madame de Rouville her procuress. Even his mother notices that he is out of sorts. But a chance meeting on the stairs outside Ad√©la√Øde's apartment is enough to dispel all Hippolyte's suspicions. He decides that he was wrong to ignore the promptings of his heart. That evening he calls on the two women. Madame de Rouville suggests a game of cards. Hippolyte loses, and when he reaches into his pocket for some money, he finds before him a purse which Ad√©la√Øde has slipped in front of him without his noticing it: \\"the poor child had the old one in her hand, and, to keep her countenance, was looking into it for the money to pay her mother. The blood rushed to Hippolyte's heart with such force that he was near fainting. The new purse, substituted for his own, and which contained his fifteen Louis d'or, was worked with gilt beads. The rings and tassels bore witness to Ad√©la√Øde's good taste, and she had no doubt spent all her little hoard in ornamenting this pretty piece of work. It was impossible to say with greater delicacy that the painter's gift could only be repaid by some proof of affection.\\" There and then Hipployte asks for Ad√©la√Øde's hand in marriage. Meanwhile Hippolyte's mother, having made inquiries about her son's condition and having learned of the whole affair, informs the Comte de Kergarouet of the malicious rumours surrounding the two women. Outraged, he explains to Madame Schinner that he loses intentionally at cards to Madame de Rouville because the Baronne's pride has left him none but these ingenious means of assisting her and her daughter in their poverty. The Comte de Kergarouet and Madame Schinner go round to Madame de Rouville's, and arrive just in time to pronounce a benediction on the young lovers' engagement. == Balzac and art == Aeneas describes to Dido the fall of Troy, by Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin (1815) In La Bourse, Balzac deals with a range of themes which he was to explore in great detail throughout La Com√©die humaine: the arts; creation in all its forms, as well as the joys and the pains which it causes. A great admirer of Eug√®ne Delacroix, whom he was later to use as a model for the character of Joseph Bridau (a painter who appears in The Black Sheep, A Start in Life and La Bourse), he depicts the act of artistic creation from every angle: the innovative and misunderstood painter (the brilliant Frenhofer in The Unknown Masterpiece); the novice painter who gains public recognition (Joseph Bridau); the wealthy man who dabbles in art (Pierre Grassou, who fritters away his talent making copies of the masters). Balzac rarely misses an opportunity to illustrate his novels with references to famous paintings, and La Bourse is no different: \\" Adelaide came behind the old gentleman's armchair and leaned her elbows on the back, unconsciously imitating the attitude given to Dido's sister by Gu√©rin in his famous picture.\\"La Bourse. Balzac also deals brilliantly with those disciplines of the arts which are dear to him and which distinguish La Com√©die humaine, treating them with a meticulousness and a precision which still astonish experts today: *Sculpture: Sarrasine whose eponymous hero is a rebel genius. *Music: Gambara, in which is described a quasi-mathematical creation of a musical work of art, and in which Balzac also gives us a meticulous analysis of one of Giacomo Meyerbeer's operas. *Lyrical art: Massimilla Doni, in which a love story serves as a pretext for a lecture on the art of Rossini. Balzac is a great storyteller and creator of fables. La Bourse is a subtle fable in which an artist ‚Äì one who, by definition, is skilled in the art of observation ‚Äì must try and make sense of the conflicting signs he observes in Madame de Rouville's apartment, as though he is trying to decipher a work of art. Balzac also portrays in this short novel a social category to which he often returns in La Com√©die humaine: the forgotten victims of Napoleon. Although regarded as a minor work,Anne-Marie Baron refers to it as an ≈ìuvrette in her Introduction to At the Sign of the Cat and Racket, also including The Ball at Sceaux , The Vendetta, p. 22. La Bourse illustrates the world of painting in a rather unexpected way. It also sheds light on other works on the same theme,Olivier Bonard, La peinture dans la cr√©ation balzacienne. Invention et vision de La Maison du chat-qui-pelote au P√®re Goriot, Droz, Geneva (1969). and on Balzac's understanding of art.Pierre Laubriet, L‚Äôintelligence de l‚Äôart chez Balzac. D‚Äôune esth√©tique balzacienne, Paris, Didier (1961). As such, it represents an important stone in the edifice of La Com√©die humaine. ==See also== * Repertory Of The Comedie Humaine ==References== * * Franc Schuerewegen, ¬´ La Toile d√©chir√©e : texte, tableau et r√©cit dans trois nouvelles de Balzac ¬ª, Po√©tique, f√©v. 1986, n¬∞ 17 (65), p. 19-27. == Notes  * The Purse at Project Gutenberg * Original French text of La Bourse * La Bourse, audio version 20px * Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, ¬´ Sinnbildung als Sicherung der Lebenswelt: Ein Beitrag zur funktionsgeschichtlichen Situierung der realistischen Literatur am Beispiel von Balzacs Erz√§hlung La Bourse ¬ª, Honor√© de Balzac, Munich, Fink, 1980, p. 339-89.

The members of STIP rotate their seats after one year in municipal council (instead of the regular term of four years) to combine their elected position with their studies. STIP is a unique democratic example of student involvement in local politics. First elected in 1994, STIP had steadily grown its representation on the municipal council. After the election victory in 1998 STIP was invited to join the ruling coalition and get a seat on the executive council (College van Burgemeester en Wethouders). Since then they have consistently remained part of the ruling coalition. Currently their representative on the executive council is deputy mayor Bas Vollebregt. STIP is the only student party in the Netherlands with a representation on the local executive council. ==Ideology and electorate== STIP has no clearly defined political ideology and self-describes itself as pragmatic. However its raison d'√™tre is improving the relationship between students and 'regular' citizens of Delft in general, and specifically improving the relationship between the Delft University of Technology and the City of Delft. Their platform calls for investments in sustainability, local high tech start-ups and cultural activities. STIP is not affiliated with a national political party. In the last years STIP has been part of local majority coalitions together with the PvdA, VVD, GroenLinks and D66. In many student cities there are conflicts between the 'regular' population of the city and the student population. Often this conflict remains unresolved partly because of under-representation of students within official representative organs such as the municipal council. The concept of a student party as a way to increase student representation in local government was named as one of the best case practices to increase student friendliness of European cities.The Student City By Leo van den Berg, Antonio Paolo Russo, European Institute for Comparative Urban Research Overwhelmingly the electorate of STIP consists of students, concentrated in the old city centre of Delft and the campus of the Delft University of Technology. ==Election results== {  ! rowspan=2Election ! colspan=3Votes ! colspan=2Seats ! rowspan=2Government - ! # ! % ! ¬± ! # ! ¬± - ! 1994  2,111  4.6%  New   New  - ! 1998  2,524  5.8%  1.2%   1  - ! 2002  3,698  8.2%  2.4%   1  - ! 2006  3,026  7.0%  1.2%   1  - ! 2010  3,287  8.0%  1.0%   1  - ! 2014  5,072  11.6%  3.6%   1  - ! 2018  6,677  14.8%  3.2%   2  } ==See also== *Student & Starter (STIP's sister party in Utrecht) *Student en Stad (STIP's sister party in Groningen) *Municipal politics in the Netherlands ==External links== * stipdelft.nl Website of the political party STIP (in Dutch). ==References== Category:Delft Category:Local political parties in the Netherlands Category:Political parties established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Student political organisations in the Netherlands ","title":"Studenten Techniek In Politiek"},{"id":"20392554","text":"Fred Early McAlister Jr. (March 1, 1928 ‚Äì November 23, 2008) was an American minor league baseball player and later a scout and front-office executive in Major League Baseball (MLB) who spent 63 years in the St. Louis Cardinals organization.

She taught elementary school for two years at Redeemer Lutheran School in Westfield, New Jersey, before going to Brooklyn to do parish work. She received her M.S. in Early Childhood Education from Hunter College in New York City. ==Career== Before her retirement, Husberg worked for thirty-six years as a Director in one of the 450 publicly funded day care centers in New York City. For 55 years she has been the Director of Music at St. John the Evangelist Lutheran Church, now a multicultural congregation in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. On June 10, 2000, she was presented with the Servant of Christ award from the Atlantic District of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod for her contribution to the greater church in the field of music, specifically in the area of hymns and congregational song. ==Composing== Husberg has had 286 hymn tunes published in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the U.K, and China. Her hymns are in hymnals and supplements published by a variety of publishers and denominations, including the popular Methodist supplement, The Faith We Sing, which also includes her most popular tune, Jennings-Houston, now published in six different hymnals and supplements,Husberg, Amanda; Richard Leach: Come and Hear the Blessing, Abingdon Press, 2005, cover copy including Lutheran Worship. She has written two liturgical masses, one of which, The Brooklyn Mass, is currently being used at her church. She also has had several choral pieces published. Her own book of 47 tunes to new texts (including 8 of her own), When You Pass Through the Waters, was published by Wayne Leupold Editions, Inc., in 2005. A new collection of 70 tunes was published in 2012, with texts by Lutheran poet and hymn text writer, Gracia Grindal. The texts and tunes cover the New Testament readings for Lectionary year B.

This Psalter was published by Concordia Publishing House in 2012. In 2013, Concordia Publishing House published a second Psalter book in the series. In 2014, the third book of the series was published. When Husberg first came to St. John's Church, it was entirely African-American. Through the years she has played spirituals, jazz, gospel, and a variety of other styles of music, from Johann Sebastian Bach to Andra√© Crouch. All this is reflected in the variety of styles she writes in for her hymns, with a special love of early American pentatonic music and gospel music. She is a member of the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada and credits them with nurturing her hymn writing efforts.Husberg, Amanda: When You Pass Through the Waters, Wayne Leupold Editions, Inc., 2005, p. vi She writes for congregational singing, believing that we do sing with one voice, young and old, people of all walks of life, new singers and experienced singers. Together we sing praise to the One who accepts all our praise, no matter how beautiful it is, or how humble it may be. She is also a member of the American Composers Forum, the Association of Lutheran Church Musicians, and ASCAP, from which she has received yearly awards since 2001. ==The Requiem Mass for Terrance Lindall== Husberg has completed a resurrection requiem mass \\"A Feast Prepared\\", written at the request of Terrance Lindall, a renowned artist of Lutheran upbringing whose illustrations for John Milton's Paradise Lost are the most famous of the 20th century for the subject. The text of the requiem mass is new, written by Lutheran sacred poet and hymn writer Richard Leach. The Requiem was premiered in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, the weekend of March 5 and 6, 2011. Terrance Lindall painted Husberg into his Paradise Lost Altarpiece to honor her and Richard Leach for their efforts on the requiem. A signed and dedicated copy of the requiem is in the collection of the Yuko Nii Foundation and the Robert J. Wickenheiser Milton collection along with full sized Giclee prints of the altarpiece signed by Lindall. ==Published work== * Come and Hear the Blessing, Hymns on the Beatitudes (with Richard Leach), Abingdon Press, 2006 * When You Pass Through the Waters, Wayne Leupold Editions, Inc., 2005 * A Feast Prepared: A Requiem, Concordia Publishing House, 2012, 97-7479 * A Treasury of Faith, Lectionary Hymns New Testament Series B, Wayne Leupold Editions, Inc., 2012, * The Concordia Psalter Series C, Set 1 ', Concordia Publishing House, 2012, 97-7480 * The Concordia Psalter Series A, Set 2 ', Concordia Publishing House, 2013, 97-7623 * The Concordia Psalter Series B, Set 3 ', Concordia Publishing House, 2014, 97-7670 * I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say - 4 pt. choral piece with instrumental descant, Concordia Publishing House, * I Lift My Eyes to See - 4 pt. choral piece with instrumental descant, text by Stephen Starke, Concordia Publishing House* * A Treasury of Faith, Lectionary Hymns Old Testament Series C, Wayne Leupold Editions, Inc., 2017, ==Notes * Biography Category:American female composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:Musicians from Chicago Category:Hunter College alumni Category:Concordia University Nebraska alumni Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod people Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American women musicians Category:20th-century women composers Category:21st-century women composers ","title":"Amanda Husberg"},{"id":"20392871","text":"The Eaton Electric Generating Plant was a three-unit Natural gas-fired power plant located in Forrest County, in Petal, Mississippi.

In the mid to late 19th century he was an outspoken defender of homeopathy and a critic of the medical establishment of the time, which practised what is now termed Heroic medicine. Samuel Cockburn was born into a family of shoemakers in Duns, Scottish Borders, a market town that was the county seat of Berwickshire in the Scottish Borders. As a young man he worked as an apothecary on the Square in Duns, Scottish Borders. In 1848 he completed an MD degree from the University of St Andrews and received a Licentiate from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd). At this time the medical community in Edinburgh had already for some years been animated by a heated debate between the medical establishment (including such notable figures as Professor James Syme, Professor Sir James Simpson and Professor Sir Robert Christison) and proponents of the alternative medical system of homeopathy advocated at the University by Professor William Henderson, Professor Charles Ransford (a Fellow and former Treasurer of the RCSEd) and others. Efforts to expel Henderson from the RCSEd had already been made repeatedly in the 1840s and 1850s, but without success. Cockburn was evidently won over by the alternative medical system, and spent the first 14 years of his medical career as the physician at the Dundee Homeopathic Dispensary (opened on 16 June 1849). In January 1856 he completed a book, titled Medical Reform, which was aimed at a broad readership and was published in both Great Britain and the United States. The book appeared at a critical time when the appropriate directions of necessary medical reform were being widely debated. In 1857 Prof. Syme published his second open letter to the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, calling for medical reforms that would require strict conformity with the conventional practices advocated by the RCSEd. Cockburn's work is both a strongly worded critique of conventional medical practices of that time (e.g. bloodletting and the ill-informed use of potentially dangerous medicines) as well as a vigorous defense of homeopathy. It attempts to discredit the medical establishment by giving examples of contradictory treatments recommended by contemporary medical theory (which Cockburn called allopathy, a derogatory term used by homeopaths). The book also denounced the \\"heavy-handed\\" attempts by the RCSEd to pressure its members (including himself) to avoid the \\"quackery\\" of homeopathy. In 1862 Cockburn moved to Glasgow, where he practiced homeopathy for the rest of his career. As well as practicing homeopathy at his clinic, Cockburn continued to lecture and publish articles on homeopathy. He was an active member of the British Homeopathic Society and a well-known member of the homeopathic community in Glasgow in the late 19th century. In his retirement, Cockburn wrote two books that expounded on his convictions concerning the relationship between science and religion. ==Publications== *Samuel Cockburn, Homeopathy, a System of Medicine founded on Facts, not on Speculation, 1850. *Samuel Cockburn, M.D., Medical Reform: Being an Examination into the Nature of the Prevailing System of Medicine; and an Exposition of its Chief Evils; with Allopathic Revelations.

The HUD-1 (or a similar variant called the HUD-1A) is used primarily for reverse mortgages and mortgage refinance transactions. The reference to 'HUD' in the form's name refers to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal regulations require that unless its use is specifically exempted, either the HUD-1 or the HUD-1A, as appropriate, must be used for all mortgage transactions that are subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Prior to October 3, 2015, the form was used in closed-end consumer credit transactions that were secured by real property or cooperative units. But as of that date, the TILA/RESPA integrated disclosure (TRID) rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established a specific HUD-1/HUD-1A exemption. The TRID rule mandates the use of a Closing Disclosure form instead. The use of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A is also exempted for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) covered by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. A HUD-1 or HUD-1A Settlement Statement is prepared by a creditor or, more typically, by the settlement agent who conducts the closing on the creditor's behalf. The settlement agent must permit the borrower to inspect the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, completed to set forth those items that are known to the settlement agent at the time of inspection, during the business day immediately preceding settlement. Items related only to the seller's transaction may be omitted from the HUD-1. == References == * RESPA - Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act * Simple guide to the HUD-1 Settlement Statement Category:Real property law in the United States Category:United States government forms Category:United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Category:Housing law ","title":"HUD-1 Settlement Statement"},{"id":"20393057","text":"The Committee for the Economy is a Northern Ireland Assembly committee established to advise, assist and scrutinise the work of the Department for the Economy and Minister for the Economy.

Its last assignment was with the 408th Fighter Group at Kingsley Field, Oregon, where it was inactivated on 1 July 1968. The squadron was first activated during World War II as the 322d Fighter Squadron. It served as a training unit in the United States until 1944, when it was disbanded in a general reorganization of Army Air Forces training units. It was reactivated in 1955 as part of Project Arrow and served as a Cold War air defense unit until inactivated. ==HistoryWorld War II=== The squadron was first activated as the 322d Fighter Squadron in the summer of 1942 as part of I Fighter Command. It flew early-model Republic P-47B Thunderbolts as part of the air defense of New York in the early part of World War II. It then became a P-47D Operational training unit (OTU) in New England. It was reassigned to III Fighter Command and moved to North Carolina in 1943 as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). The squadron was disbanded in April 1944 as part of a reorganization of training units. ===Cold War=== The squadron was reconstituted as the 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and reactivated in 1955 at Larson Air Force Base, Washington. The squadron assumed the mission, personnel and aircraft of the inactivating 31st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron as part of \\"Project Arrow\\", an Air Defense Command (ADC) program which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.Buss, Sturm, Volan, Denys & McMullen, p.6 The squadron was equipped with radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabres. The squadron was upgraded to the North American F-86L, an improved version of the Sabre which incorporated the Semi Automatic Ground Environment computer-controlled direction system for intercepts.Cornett & Johnson The service of the F-86L was quite brief, since by the time the last F-86L conversion was delivered, the type was already being phased out in favor of supersonic interceptors. The squadron moved to Kingsley Field, Oregon in 1959 and was re-equipped with new McDonnell F-101B Voodoo supersonic interceptor, and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and was fully combat-capable. The 322d operated Voodoos until July 1968, when the aircraft were passed to the Air National Guard and the squadron was inactivated as part of the general reduction of the Air Defense Command active-duty interceptor force. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 322d Fighter Squadron on 24 June 1942 : Activated on 19 August 1942 : Disbanded on 10 April 1944 * Reconstituted and redesignated 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 20 June 1955 : Activated on 18 August 1955Lineage, including assignments, stations and aircraft through 1963 in Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 395‚Äì396 : Inactivated on 1 July 1968 ===Assignments=== * 326th Fighter Group, 19 August 1942 ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * 9th Air Division, 18 August 1955 * 4721st Air Defense Group, 1 December 1956 * 408th Fighter Group, 1 April 1959 ‚Äì 1 July 1968 ===Stations=== * Mitchel Field, New York, 19 August 1942 * Bradley Field, Connecticut, 1 September 1942 * Westover Field, Massachusetts, 1 November 1942 * Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina, 13 October 1943 ‚Äì 10 April 1944 * Larson Air Force Base, Washington, 18 August 1955 * Kingsley Field, Oregon, 1 April 1959 ‚Äì 1 July 1968 ===Aircraft=== * Republic P-47B Thunderbolt, 1942‚Äì1943 * Republic P-47D Thunderbolt, 1943‚Äì1944 * North American F-86D Sabre, 1955‚Äì1957 * North American F-86L Sabre, 1957‚Äì1959 * McDonnell F-101B Voodoo, 1959‚Äì1968 * McDonnell F-101F Voodoo, 1959‚Äì1968 ==See alsoReferencesNotes=== ; Explanatory Notes ; Citations ===Bibliography=== * Buss, Lydus H.(ed), Sturm, Thomas A., Volan, Denys, and McMullen, Richard F., History of Continental Air Defense Command and Air Defense Command July to December 1955, Directorate of Historical Services, Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, 1956 * * (subscription required for web access) * * \\"ADCOM's Fighter Interceptor Squadrons\\".

Tattersall describes a check or plaid pattern woven into cloth. The pattern is composed of regularly-spaced thin, even vertical warp stripes, repeated horizontally in the weft, thereby forming squares. The stripes are usually in two alternating colours, generally darker on a light ground. The cloth pattern takes its name from Tattersall's horse market, which was started in London in 1766. During the 18th century at Tattersall's horse market blankets with this checked pattern were sold for use on horses. Today tattersall is a common pattern, often woven in cotton, particularly in flannel, used for shirts or waistcoats. Tattersall shirts, along with gingham, are often worn in country attire, for example in combination with tweed suits and jackets. Traditional vests of this cloth are often used by horseback riders in formal riding attire, and adorned with a stock tie. ==See also== * British country clothing ==References== Category:Textile patterns ","title":"Tattersall (cloth)"},{"id":"20393145","text":"Moonlighting is an American television series that aired on ABC from March 3, 1985, to May 14, 1989.

Ch. 569, enacted May 15, 1928) authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct projects for the control of floods on the Mississippi River and its tributaries as well as the Sacramento River in California.Flood Control Act of 1928 on Mississippi Valley Division of USACE website It was sponsored by Sen. Wesley L. Jones (R) of Washington and Rep. Frank R. Reid (R) of Illinois, in response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. ==Significance== FCA 1928 had three important effects. It increased public awareness of advances in flood control theory and practice. It put flood control on par with other major projects of its time with the largest public works appropriation ever authorized. And, FCA 1928 increased debate on local contributions to a new level.The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936 ==Section 1: Mississippi River Valley project == Authorized the project for the flood control of the Mississippi River in its alluvial valley and for its improvement from the Head of Passes to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in accordance with the engineering plan set forth and recommended in the report submitted by the Chief of Engineers. Created a board consisting of the Chief of Engineers, the president of the Mississippi River Commission, and a civil engineer chosen from civil life appointed by the President. The board was to consider the engineering differences between the project adopted by the Act (the Chief of Engineers' plans) and plans recommended by the Mississippi River Commission. The project and the changes therein are to be executed in accordance with section 8 of the Act. Directed surveys to be made between Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Cape Girardeau, Missouri to ascertain and determine the best method of securing flood relief in addition to levees. These surveys were to be made before any flood-control works other than levees and revetments are undertaken on that portion of the river. Directed the character of diversion works and outlets. They are to be built in a manner and of a character which will fully and amply protect the adjacent lands ensuring the same degree of protection on the east side as is afforded by levees on the west side of the river. Nothing in the Act was meant to prevent, postpone, delay, or in anywise interfere with the execution of that part of the project on the east side of the river. Consolidated funding. All unexpended balances of previous appropriations for flood control on the Mississippi River under the Flood Control Act of 1917 and the Flood Control Act of 1923, were made available for expenditure except for work under section 13. ==Section 2: Local contribution and participation== Reiterated the soundness of the principle of local contribution toward the cost of flood-control work which had been incorporated in all previous national legislation, recognizing the special interest of the local population in its own protection, and as a means of preventing inordinate requests for unjustified items of work having no material national interest. Recognized the expenditure estimated at approximately $292 million already made by the local interests; in view of the extent of national concern in the control of these floods in the interests of national prosperity, the flow of interstate commerce, and the movement of the United States mails; and, in view of the gigantic scale of the project, involving flood waters of a volume and flowing from a drainage area largely outside the States most affected, and far exceeding those of any other river in the United States, no local contribution to the project was required, and given. ==Section 3: Local entities must maintain completed projects == Prohibited expending funds until the States or levee districts gave assurances that they would maintain all flood-control works after their completion, except controlling and regulating spillway structures, including special relief levees; would agree to accept land turned over to them, and provide without cost to the United States, all rights of way for levee foundations and levees on the main stem of the Mississippi River between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Head of Passes. ===Relief from Liability=== A key provision of FCA 1928 was that no liability of any kind would attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place. The act also stated that, if on any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it was impracticable to construct levees (either because such construction is not economically justified or because such construction would unreasonably restrict the flood channel) and previously unaffected lands are subjected to overflow and damage by reason of the construction of levees on the opposite banks of the river, the Government has a duty to acquire either ownership or flowage rights over such lands. In January 2008, this liability provision played a controversial role concerning the legal cases resulting from the levee failures in New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005. Federal Judge Stanwood Duval, of the US District Court for Eastern Louisiana, held the US Army Corps of Engineers responsible for defects in the design of the concrete I-wall floodwall constructed in the earthen levees of the 17th Street Canal in the period following Hurricane Betsy (1965). However, he further stated that the agency could not be held financially liable due to the sovereign immunity provided by this legislation.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/us/01corps.html?_r=2&ref;=us In April 2010, scholars with the Louisiana State Office of Historic Preservation approved the text for a Historic Plaque for the 17th Street Canal.https://www.scribd.com/doc/62721916/Approval-letter-for-17th-Street- Plaque-dated-April-30-2010 After receiving permission from city agencies and the Corps of Engineers, the flood protection group Levees.org installed the Plaque at ground zero, on New Orleans city property, in the Lakeview neighborhood.http://www.wdsu.com/news/24733275/detail.html%22%3Ehttp://www.wdsu.com/news/24733275/detail.html The text of the plaque read as follows: ==Section 4: Flowage Rights== Provide Federal government flowage rights for additional destructive flood waters that will pass by reason of diversions from the main channel of the Mississippi River. Provided that any benefits to property from execution of the flood- control plan would be taken into consideration in reducing the amount of compensation paid for flowage rights. Provided a method to obtain lands to execute the plan. The Government can acquire by condemnation, purchase, or donation any lands, easements, or rights of way which are needed in carrying out this project. Provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1918 were made applicable to the acquisition of lands, easements, or rights of way needed for works of flood control. ==Section 5: Surveys== The Secretary of War, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, could engage the services and assistance of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the United States Geological Survey, or other Government mapping agencies, in preparing maps required for this project. ==Section 6: Rights of Way== Authorized expenditure of funds up to $10 million for previously authorized flood control works on the Mississippi River, including levee work on the Mississippi River between Rock Island, Illinois, and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and outlets and tributaries affected by the backwaters of the Mississippi. Stipulated that, between Rock Island, Illinois, and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the States or levee districts are to provide rights of way at no cost to the United States, contribute one- third of the costs, and maintain them after completion. Authorized emergency expenses. In an emergency, funds may be expended for the maintenance of any levee when it is demonstrated that the levee can not be adequately maintained by the State or levee district. Since Section 9 of the United States Constitution prohibits spending of public money except by the express direction of Congress, this authorization allows the Government to step in to assist local and state governments in an emergency.United States Constitution ==Section 7: Emergency fund== $5 million was authorized as an emergency fund in rescue work or in the repair or maintenance of any flood-control work on any tributaries of the Mississippi River threatened or destroyed by flood including the flood of 1927. ==Section 8: Work of the Mississippi River Commission== The Mississippi River Commission, under direction of the Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers was to execute the project. For all other purposes, the existing laws governing the commission remained unchanged. The commission was to inspect frequently enough and hold hearings to enable it to acquire first-hand information as to conditions and problems of flood control within the area of its jurisdiction. It established that the president/executive officer of the commission is to qualifications prescribed by law for the Assistant Chief of Engineers and be given the rank, pay, and allowances of a brigadier general. It established the salaries for officers of the Commission. ==Section 10: Proceed speedily and provide reports on various rivers systems== Surveys of the Mississippi River and its tributaries were to be done as speedily as practicable. Directed the Corps of Engineers to prepare and submit reports on projects for flood control on tributaries of the Mississippi River including * The Red River and tributaries * The Yazoo River and tributaries * The White River and tributaries * The Saint Francis River and tributaries * The Arkansas River and tributaries * The Ohio River and tributaries * The Missouri River and tributaries * The Illinois River and tributaries The reports were to include * the effect of further flood control of the lower Mississippi River through control of flood waters in tributary drainage basins by the establishment of a reservoir system * the benefits that will accrue to navigation and agriculture * capacity of local districts to receive and hold flood waters * prospective income from reservoir waters (e.g., hydropower) * use of reservoirs for public and private uses * return flow of waters, and * the stabilizing effect on stream flow to prevent erosion, siltage, and improve navigation. This direction from Congress had the impact of forcing the balancing of competing interests when considering flood control projects. Authorized $5 million to be used out of the appropriation authorized by the Act, in addition to amounts authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1927, to be expended for the projects authorized. Directed flood surveys to be made simultaneously with the flood-control work on the Mississippi River. Directed that the United States Department of Agriculture and such other agencies determine how Mississippi Valley floods may be controlled by proper forestry practice. ==Section 11: Previous projects below Cape Girardeau== Directed the Mississippi River Commission to examine the Mississippi River below Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where levees had previously been constructed on one side of the river and adversely affected land on the other side of the river. Directed construction of levees possible to reduce the impact if economically justified. Concerning a recommendation by the Mississippi River Commission in October 1912 to build a levee from Tiptonville, Tennessee, to the Obion River in Tennessee, the Commission was authorized to resurvey the proposed levee and relocate the same if necessary. If such levee was found feasible and approved by the board, it shall be built out of appropriations hereafter to be made. ==Section 12: All other laws inconsistent with this law are repealed== All laws or parts of laws inconsistent with FCA 1928 were repealed. ==Section 13: Sacramento River flood control== The project for the control of floods in the Sacramento River, California, adopted by section 2 of the Act approved March 1, 1917, entitled \\"An Act to provide for the control of the floods of the Mississippi River and of the Sacramento River, California, and for other purposes,\\" is hereby modified in accordance with the report of the California Debris Commission, provided that the total amounts contributed by the Federal Government, including previous amounts contributed, shall not exceed $17.6 million. ==Section 14: Title 41 USC is applicable== In every contract or agreement to be made or entered into for the acquisition of land either by private sale or condemnation as in this Act provided the provisions contained in section 3741 of the Revised Statutes being section 22 of title 41 of the United States Code shall be applicable. ==See also== For related legislation which sometime also implement flood control provisions, see the following: * Rivers and Harbors Act * Water Resources Development Act * Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 ==References== Category:1928 in the environment Category:1928 in law Category:70th United States Congress 1928 Category:Presidency of Calvin Coolidge ","title":"Flood Control Act of 1928"},{"id":"20393280","text":"James Turner (fl. 1854-1866) was an American criminal figure, pugilist and \\"slugger\\" for Tammany Hall.

He eventually surfaced in New York City where he found employment with Captain Isaac Rynders and his Empire Club. In a short time, he became one of the Rynders' most feared \\"sluggers\\". In January 1855, Turner and Lew Baker entered Platt's Hall and became involved in a verbal altercation with prizefighter Tom Hyer \\"calling the fighter vile names\\". The argument escalated until Turner drew his pistol and shot Hyer in the neck. Hyer fired back but missed, hitting the wall instead. Putting away his weapon, Hyer attacked his assailants and dragged Baker out into the street, but the fight came to an end when a police officer arrived. The fight was broken up, but no charges were brought against the three.Sutton, Charles; James B. Mix and Samuel A. Mackeever, ed. The New York Tombs: Its Secrets and Its Mysteries.

Although most accounts claim Baker shot Poole when the two began fighting, another version has Turner and McLaughlin participating in the barroom brawl according to retired police chief George W. Walling. In this version, Turner pulled out a pistol to fire at Poole, using the hollow of his left arm as a rest, but shot himself in the arm with an eight-inch Colt Navy Revolver.Monkkonen, Eric H.

(pg. 308) For several years, he feuded with Tricker and Sirocco over control of Chinatown's graft and was the main competitor of their establishment The Flea Bag. He became a major political organizer for Tammany Hall, successful in taking power in Chinatown following the arrest of Monk Eastman in 1904, and was eventually awarded control of the district by Tammany politicians. Both Tricker and Sirocco resisted Kelly's attempts to take over but were forced out after a police raid led to the close of The Flea Bag. ==1905== In May 1905, he was assaulted in the Bowery near Great Jones Street by members of the Five Points Gang under Paul Kelly. Although he received only minor injuries, bouncers from The Folly and New Brighton began fighting each other resulting in three men being stabbed and the murder of \\"Eat 'Em Up\\" Jack McManus. Both Kelly and Tricker were both assaulted in separate incidents shortly before McManus's murder, Kelly being stabbed in the back with a stiletto on First Avenue near Fourth Street.\\"Eat-'Em-Up M'Manus Killed In Gang Feud; End of Notorious Bouncer, Formerly of Suicide Hall, Bowery Bands' Deadly War Shootings and Stabbings the Outcome of Rivalry Between the Kelly and the Five Points Adherents\\". _New York Times._ 27 May 1905 ==1908== In November 1908, while walking to his home, he was attacked by members of the Humpty Jackson Gang shortly after hosting a ball at Tammany Hall.

While in attendance at Sirocco's annual ball at Tammany Hall in February 1912, Becker overheard plans to murder Kelly and spent the rest of the night with several other officers guarding Kelly's place. Although no attack took place that night, Becker searched Sirocco's Little Rock headquarters at Broome Street and confiscated a rifle and two revolvers. The cafe was under guard for three more days when, while walking through the Bowery with Louie the Lump, an unidentified gunman fired at them from a hallway. Neither men were hit but later that day another attempt was made while the two were at Baxter Street after walking through Mulberry Bend Park. Once again, the unknown gunman missed but Louie fired three shots in return injuring day laborer Patrick McKenna as a result. Louie the Lump was taken into custody along with another man, suspected by police to be the shooter, while Kelly ran to Elizabeth Street Station where he asked for protection.

Matters worsened when Detective Val O'Farrell, in charge of hiring security for Madison Square Garden, refused to hire several of his men for the annual six-day bicycle race being held at the venue. On the morning of December 12, a gunfight broke out between members of his club and those from Sirocco's near Madison Square Garden. Around 2:00 am, a group of Sirocco's men left Madison Square Garden and were ambushed near the corner of Fourth Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street by Kelly's men firing from behind a Madison Avenue trolley car. Although the gunfight was brief, an estimated fifty rounds had been used and ended only until gunmen on both sides ran out of ammunition. No one was reported injured, the passengers on the trolley avoiding being hit by dropping to the floor, despite the large number of spectators entering and leaving Madison Square Garden to watch the annual six-day bicycle race being held.\\"Gunmen's Battle Fought At Garden; Jimmy Kelly and Sirocco Gangs Clash, but Pistol Shots Miss Their Marks\\". _New York Times._ 13 December 1913 Most of the participants were able to escape as police from local precincts investigating the gunfire began entering the area. Kelly's gunmen, according arriving to police officers, were picked up by a large black touring car which they began firing at hoping to shoot out the tires. The car was last seen heading towards Second Avenue but police were unable to pursue them. Two of Sirocco's men, Tony Rossa and Frank Jula, were arrested by police and taken to Jefferson Market Court where they were arraigned and held on a $2,000 bail. The two had no previous criminal record but had ties with Jack Sirocco and were believed to have thrown away their weapons. Six empty revolvers were found by police at the scene. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Fowler, Gene. Beau James: The Life & Times of Jimmy Walker. New York: Viking Press, 1949. *Levinson, Edward.

He was the first man, along with partner John Frink, to establish illegal gambling and policy banks. Parsons was considered the top gambler, known as the \\"Great American Faro Banker\\", and held control over illegal gambling in the city for more than two decades. His operations are considered the first major criminal organization, although neither centralized nor having a corporate-like structure, its system remaining in place for well over a century and surviving in various forms up until as late as the late 1980s. ==Life== A native of New England, Parsons originally arrived in New York City with the intention of starting his own business. He lost the small fortune he had brought with him, several thousand dollars, in a gambling house soon after his arrival. Impressed by how quickly he had lost his money, he instead decided to open his own gambling house and used his entrepreneurial skills to build a successful gambling empire by financing other gamblers. He also differed from typical gamblers by being \\"dressed plainly and was unassuming in manner\\". Parsons also refrained from publicly appearing at his establishments, allowing John Frink to handle the day-to-day operations, and never gambled after his first experience.Asbury, Herbert.

Their organization lacked any formal structure however, as least compared to the organized crime syndicates seen during the next century, and most operators retained independent control of their own establishments. Parsons used his income from gambling which he invested in real estate and was eventually able to retire.

It is located in the village of Sulz im Weinviertel, about 45 km north of Vienna in the province of Lower Austria. The Museumsdorf Niedersulz has over 80 original buildings and structures that have been transported from their original sites. The Village-Museum of Niedersulz is the largest open-air museum in Lower Austria and was founded in 1979. It consists of 80 historical buildings. Taken from around the region, these were torn down and rebuilt here from their original parts. The Village-Museum is laid out in the form of a row-village. This is a traditional form of settlement set along a stream going back to the year 1000 AD. The houses along Village Street (Dorfstra√üe) are rectangular in shape. They consist of a housing unit, a stable, an oblong shed and an out-building which also delineates the back side of the piece of property. In addition to the main attraction of the buildings themselves some of the crafting buildings operate on weekends to give demonstrations of traditional rural crafts and techniques. In on the building complexes there are also farmyard animals. ==Typical Types of Houses== *Streckhof: The Streckhof (long, straight) type is the original form of house. The gabled side of the house faces the street. The rooms are laid out next to each other under one roof and each can be entered from the outside of the building. *Zwerchhof: The Zwerchhof (L-shaped) type of house included a larger Streckhof-type structure with an adjacent row of stalls for livestock, each stall facing out onto a covered walkway. This is how the L-shaped floor plan developed. *Doppelhakenhof: The Doppelhakenhof (U-shaped, lit. double-hook) type of house is a further development from the Zwerchhof. A large shed is attached to the row of stalls, creating a U-shaped floor plan. *Kleinh√§uslerhaus (lit. small house owned by a person of the ‚Äòsmall house‚Äô rank of society): This house is significantly younger than the classic styles of houses. It was the home of lower levels of society and often consisted of only one structure. It looked like the main part of a farmhouse. == External links == * Open Air Museum Niedersulz Category:Open-air museums in Austria Category:Museums in Lower Austria ","title":"Museumsdorf Niedersulz"},{"id":"20393504","text":"William H.

He was a high-ranking member and the final leader of the White Hand Gang. He succeeded Bill Lovett after his murder in 1923 and, under his leadership, led a two-year campaign against Frankie Yale over the New York waterfront until he and five of his lieutenants were killed in South Brooklyn during a Christmas Day celebration at the Adonis Social Club in 1925.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 78) ==Biography== Richard Lonergan was one of fifteen children, among them being Anna Lonergan known as \\"Queen of the Irishtown docks\\", born to local prize fighter and bare knuckle boxer John Lonergan. Raised in Irishtown, an Irish-American enclave between the Manhattan and Brooklyn waterfront, he later lost his right leg in a trolley car accident as a child from which his underworld nickname \\"Peg Leg\\" originated. A childhood friend and later brother-in-law of Bill Lovett, Lonergan had earned a fearsome reputation in Irishtown and on the Brooklyn waterfront as a vicious street brawler after killing a Sicilian drug dealer in a Navy Street bike shop. Believed by authorities to have been involved in at least a dozen murders during his criminal career, he was reportedly well known for his hatred of Italian- Americans and would occasionally lead \\"ginzo hunting\\" expeditions in saloons and dive bars along the waterfront. He became the leader of the White Hand Gang shortly after the murder of its leader Bill Lovett in 1923. Lonergan spent the next two years battling Frankie Yale over control of the New York waterfront.Bergreen, Laurence. Capone: The Man and the Era. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996.

Leicester: Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2005. (pg. 125-129) On the night of December 25, 1925, Lonergan and five of his men entered the Adonis Social Club during a Christmas celebration. Lonergan and the other White handers, according to witnesses, were intoxicated and being unruly to other patrons. Lonergan himself loudly and openly called nearby customers \\"wops\\", \\"dagos\\" and other ethnic slurs. When three local Irish girls entered the club escorted by their Italian dates, Lonergan chased them out supposedly yelling at them to \\"Come back with white men, fer chrissake!\\" It was at that moment that the lights went out and gunfire was heard. Customers rushed for the exits in a panic as glass was shattered as well as tables and chairs being overturned. As police arrived, they found one of Lonergan's men, his best friend Aaron Harms, dead in the street and they followed a blood trail into the club where they found Lonergan and drug addict Cornelius \\"Needles\\" Ferry on the dance floor near a player piano shot execution style. A fourth member, James Hart, managed to escape, having been found a few blocks away crawling on the sidewalk after being shot in the thigh and leg. He was taken to the Cumberland Street Hospital where he eventually recovered but refused to cooperate with police. He denied being at the club claiming he had been shot by a stray bullet from a passing car. The two other members, Joseph \\"Ragtime Joe\\" Howard and Patrick \\"Happy\\" Maloney, were apparently unaccounted for leaving no witnesses willing to testify.Kobler, John. Capone: The Life and World of Al Capone. New York: Da Capo Press, 2003. (pg. 163-164) Although seven men had been arrested in connection to the shooting, including a visiting Al Capone, all the men were released on bail ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 and the case was eventually dismissed. Anna Lonergan publicly blamed the gangland shooting on \\"foreigners\\" commenting \\"You can bet it was no Irish American like ourselves who would stage a mean murder like this on Christmas Day\\". The killings are generally attributed to Capone, in partnership with Frankie Yale, although these often colorful accounts are sometimes vague and inconsistent but allege that the incident was prearranged. It is with the death of Lonergan however that the White Hand Gang disappeared from the Brooklyn waterfront allowing Frankie Yale and eventually the Five Families to take control.Mannion, James.

He and his wife work together, and he has both written articles and directed documentaries about chimpanzees. He is of French and Swiss nationality. He received his degree in biology from the University of Geneva, and his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich in 1984.Christophe Boesch: Curriculum Vitae. Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. His dissertation was entitled \\"Nut-Cracking Behaviour of Wild Chimpanzees\\". After this, he attended the University of Basel, to receive a degree in habilitation in 1994. Boesch's first field experience was in 1973, conducting census work on the mountain gorillas of Virunga National Park in Rwanda, under the supervision of Dian Fossey. In 1975 and 1977 he taught at a secondary school in Geneva; followed by time as an assistant in the Department of Ethology and Wildlife Research at the University of Zurich. In 1976, Boesch began his work with chimpanzees at Ta√Ø National Park in C√¥te d'Ivoire. One of his current ongoing projects was begun in 1979, studying the \\"ecology, social organization, tool-use, hunting, cooperation, food-sharing, inter-community relationships, and cognitive capacities\\" of the chimpanzees at Ta√Ø National Park. Since 1997, he has been the Director of the Department of Primatology of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. He is also the founder and president of the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation. Boesch and several other scientists have found evidence about how easily disease can be passed from human tourists and researchers to the great apes they are observing; this research has helped to make great ape tourism more hygienic. Boesch and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have also contributed to our understanding of chimpanzee mating habits through collection and analysis of chimpanzee DNA. ==References External links == * == Video == * Video on Christophe Boesch's research (Latest Thinking) Category:Primatologists Category:French biologists Category:Swiss biologists Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:People from St. Gallen (city) ","title":"Christophe Boesch"},{"id":"20393613","text":"The Home Equity Theft Prevention Act (HETPA, NY RPL ¬ß265-a) is a New York State law passed on July 26, 2006, to provide homeowners of residential property with information and disclosures in order to make informed decisions when approached by persons seeking a sale or transfer of the homeowner's property, particularly when homeowners are in default on their mortgage payments or the property is in foreclosure. == Covered contract == A contract is covered if it is either (i) currently in foreclosure or on a tax lien sale list; or (ii) the owner is in default (behind on mortgage payments by 2+ months) and the sale involves a reconveyance agreement. A reconveyance arrangement has two elements: (i) A sale, mortgage, lien, encumbrance or any other method which allows an \\"equity purchaser\\" to obtain legal or equitable title to all or part of the property; and (ii) Some agreement or promise to the \\"equity seller\\" that he/she can regain ownership of the property (e.g., the purchase agreement, option to purchase, lease, etc.) There are some key requirements for a valid reconveyance agreement. The equity purchaser needs the equity seller's permission to resell the property to anyone else for so long as the equity seller has a right to buy the property back. Either (i) title to the property must eventually be reconveyed to the equity seller; or (ii) the equity purchaser must have paid seller at least 82% of the fair market value of the property within 120 days of the eviction or voluntary relinquishment by the equity seller. The equity purchaser must confirm that the equity seller has the \\"reasonable ability\\" to buy back the property and the deed must recite that the property is subject to reconveyance and the terms of the reconveyance arrangement. == Contractual requirements == Once a contract is determined to be covered by the Act, there are some strict contractual requirements that must be met: The contract must contain the entire agreement between the parties and must meet the following format requirements: Contract must be fully completed (i.e., no blank spaces); Font size equal to at least 12-point bold type; In English or in both English or Spanish if Spanish is the primary language of the equity seller; Name, address and phone number of the buyer; Address of the subject property; Consideration to be paid; List of all services that buyer has promised; Terms for payment of the consideration; Time at which possession of the property must be surrendered; Terms of any rental or lease agreement; Terms of any reconveyance agreement; Notice of right to cancellation in the immediate proximity of signature line and font in at least 14-point bold type (form in HEPTA); and Notice of cancellation form to be attached to the contract (form in HEPTA) Any provision which purports to limit the liability of the equity purchaser shall be null and void. Inclusion of such a provision shall, at the option of the equity seller, render the covered contract void. Any provision which purports to require arbitration shall be void at the option of the equity seller. Any waiver of any or all HEPTA shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to the public policy. == Five-day right of recission == The act also gives the equity seller a five-day right to cancel the contract; a \\"cooling off\\" period. Once an equity seller cancels the contract by sending the cancellation form or otherwise indicating such an intention, the equity purchaser must return all original contracts and other documents signed by the equity seller within 10 days, as well as any fee or other consideration received by the equity purchaser from the equity seller. Cancellation of the contract releases the equity seller of all obligations to pay fees to the equity purchaser. == Prohibited behavior == Before midnight on the 5th business day after the contract is executed, the equity purchaser cannot: Accept a deed; Record any document with the county clerk; Transfer any interest in the residence; Pay the equity seller any consideration; Suggest that the equity seller waive his/her right to cancel or rescind. The equity purchaser is prohibited from representing (directly or indirectly) that: Equity purchaser is an advisor or acting on behalf of the equity seller; Equity purchaser has certification that buyer actually does not have or that buyer is not a member of a licensed profession when he actually is a member of that profession; Equity purchaser is helping the equity seller \\"save\\" the residence, unless equity purchaser has a good faith basis for such representation; or Equity purchaser is helping the equity seller in preventing a foreclosure unless the equity purchaser has a good faith basis for such representation An equity purchaser shall make no false or misleading statement regarding: The value of the property; The amount of proceeds the equity seller will receive after a foreclosure sale; The timing of the judicial foreclosure process; Any contract term The equity seller's rights and obligations; The nature of any document which the equity purchaser induces the equity seller to sign; Any other false or misleading statement concerning the sale of the property or concerning a reconveyance arrangement The equity purchaser is prohibited from making any contract that takes unconscionable advantage of the equitable seller. == Remedies == 2-Year Right of Rescission - Generally, a violation of the contractual requirements or any of the prohibited acts in Subdivision 7 makes the conveyance voidable and may be rescinded within 2 years of the date the deed was recorded. The statute then gives the equity purchaser (or its successor) twenty days to reconvey the property on the condition of repayment of any consideration paid to the equity seller. HEPTA does not affect the rights of a bona-fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value if their conveyance occurred before the recording of the notice of rescission. 6-Year Statute of Limitations - Within 6 years, an equity seller may bring an action for the recovery of damages or equitable relief against an equity purchaser for a violation of HEPTA. A court may award actual damages plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The court is also authorized to award equitable relief of up to 3 times the actual damages. There are also criminal penalties for violation of prohibited behavior listed in Subdivision 7: Violation \\"with intent to defraud\\" = class E felony, subject to imprisonment and a fine of not more than $25,000. \\"Knowingly violates\\" = Class A misdemeanor, subject to a fine of not more than $25,000 and imprisonment in accordance with the penal law, or both. A mortgage broker or bank making a loan with knowledge that the equity purchaser is not complying with HEPTA is subject to penalties under Banking Law ¬ß595-a. These criminal penalties are in addition to the risk that the equity seller will rescind and thereby jeopardize the encumbrancer's interest in the property. == Exclusions == Those who acquire title as follows are excluded from HETPA: (i) To use, and then actually uses, the property as his/her primary residence; (ii) By a deed from a referee in a foreclosure sale; (iii) At any sale of property authorized by statute; (iv) By order or judgment of any court; (v) From a spouse, or from a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild or sibling of such person or such person's spouse; (vi) As a not-for-profit housing organization or as a public housing agency; or (vii) As a bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value (e.g. a lienholder) What is a Bona Fide Purchaser? One who (i) acts in good faith; (ii) purchases for valuable consideration or provide a mortgage; (iii) has no notice of the equity seller's continuing right to, or equity in, the property prior to the acquisition of title or encumbrance; (iv) has no notice of any violation of HETPA by the equity purchaser as related to the property. Generally, this is one who either purchases from or provides a loan to the equity purchaser. An equity purchaser has a defense to a violation of Subdivision 7 if he/she (i) acted in good faith; (ii) proves that the violation was not intentional (iii) proves that the violation resulted from a bona fide error despite procedures adapted to avoid such errors; (iv) notifies the equity seller within ninety days of the contract date of the compliance failure; Makes appropriate restitution within ninety days of the contract date. Examples of bona fide errors include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors. An error of legal judgment is NOT a bona fide error, nor is a failure to provide notices or other material information. == Impact on deeds in lieu of foreclosure== There is some confusion as to whether HEPTA applies to deeds in lieu of foreclosure since there is no clear exclusion as there is for referee deeds, for example. The 2-year right of rescission is not a risk that banks or title insurers are comfortable with, especially given the complexities of compliance, so many banks and title insurers are not willing to work with deeds in lieu. ==References Category:New York (state) statutes Category:Real property law in the United States Category:2006 in American law Category:Housing legislation in the United States ","title":"Home Equity Theft Prevention Act"},{"id":"20393614","text":"Phil Hassan (born 18 August 1974) is a former rugby league and rugby union footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.

The stiff sentences given out at court martials for the participants (known as the Presidio 27) attracted international attention to the extent of sentiment against the war within the U.S. armed forces and the mutiny became \\"[p]erhaps the single best known event of the domestic GI movement\\". ==Prelude== Several events and the overall conditions in the stockade set the stage for the protest. First, there was the death of Richard Bunch, a prisoner in the stockade, who was killed on October 11 with a shotgun blast while walking away from a work detail. That evening there was a vocal protest inside the stockade against the killing; Keith Mather later called it \\"a miniature riot\\". On Sunday the 13th, prison officials held a memorial service and all the prisoners went \\"because he meant something to us.\\" During the service the \\"chaplain stated it was justifiable homicide.\\" This infuriated the prisoners who knew Bunch had been shot in the back and, according to one of the prisoners, \\"We started throwing chairs in every direction and yelling.\\" Further heightening the tension, conditions in the stockade were overcrowded, with up to 140 prisoners housed in a space intended for 88, and there were charges of mistreatment by guards. On of the guards recalled later that the \\"place was extremely overcrowded...The conditions were atrocious.\\" The protest was set into motion, however, by a group of four AWOL soldiers who turned themselves in at the end of a large anti-war march in San Francisco on October 12th near where the Presidio is located. The military had made attempts to prevent service members from participating in the march, ordering up mandatory formations and special maneuvers which would keep men on base. Nevertheless, a large contingent of several hundred active duty and reserve servicemen marched at the front of the parade. The four AWOL soldiers (Linden Blake, Keith Mather, Walter Pawlowski, and Randy Rowland), having been put in the stockade, met with prisoners over the weekend and convinced them to participate in a protest over prisoner conditions and against the war. The Presidio 27 sit-down protest on October 14, 1968 with Private Walter Pawlowski standing and reading their demands just prior to arrest ==The protest== The protest was carried out during the morning formation on Monday the 14th. Twenty-eight prisoners broke ranks and sat in the grass, singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\". One of them returned to ranks when challenged, but the remainder continued to sing, with Pawlowski reading a list of demands. After the first orders to disperse were ignored, the camp commandant came and read the articles of mutiny. Randy Rowland recalled later that fire trucks pulled up around them. He said, \\"We didn't know it at the time but later we found out they told the firemen to squirt us, and the firemen said no, we fight fires, we don't do this shit.\\" Eventually the protest was broken up by military police in riot gear with \\"gas masks and their big sticks.\\" They removed the protesters one at a time. ==The trials, escapes and appeals== The protesters were all charged with mutiny, the rarest and one of the most serious military offenses, which carries a potential death penalty. They were tried in small groups in the spring of 1969, with future star criminal lawyer Brendan Sullivan among the defense counsel. Before the trials, however, three of the prisoners had escaped. On Christmas Eve in 1968, Mather and Pawlowski, \\"facing long jail terms for their leadership roles\\" and hoping to undermine the case against the other protesters by removing the \\"star defendants\\" from the trial, took advantage of the holiday distractions, jumped out a window and \\"jogged off the post\\". Two months later, Blake made a dramatic escape from a prison hospital, sawing through his window bars for two weeks at night with a smuggled hacksaw blade, and then squeezing naked through the hole. As the first defendants were sentenced to 15, 14, and 16 years at hard labor, national attention was focused on the severity of punishment for a non-violent protest. The charge of mutiny was particularly denounced, and even the officer in charge of the preliminary investigation recommended reduction of charges to \\"willful disobedience\\", but was overruled by Lt. Gen. Stanley R. Larsen, commander of the Sixth Army. On appeal, the long sentences for mutiny were voided by the Court of Military Review in June 1970, and reduced to short sentences for willful disobedience of a superior officer. Rowland, for example, was released in 1970 after a year and a half imprisonment. The three escapees fled to Canada, with Mather remaining a fugitive until 1985. At the time of his release from the Army disciplinary barracks at Ft. Riley, Mather's lawyer Howard DeNike described his client as America's \\"last prisoner of conscience from the Vietnam War.\\" ==Aftermath== Button created by the supporters of the Presidio 27 soldiers who sat-down to protest their conditions and the Vietnam War in 1968 The Presidio mutiny was the first of a number of protests and riots that drew attention to anti-war dissent within the military. It brought press investigation of the conditions at the stockade and of the situations of the protesters. For example, it was determined that none of those convicted had been given the non-combatant assignment promised by recruiters. And it highlighted a serious drawback to the military general court martial, namely that the court's deciding members are \\"named - and then rated - by the man who sends the case to trial in the first place.\\". But even more significantly it raised the fundamental question of democracy within the military. Can, and should, rank-and-file soldiers debate and read about the war they are assigned to fight; and what if they disagree with their commanders? These same issues were working their way through the federal courts in the case of Captain Howard Levy, another early resister to the Vietnam War, eventually being decided by the Supreme Court in the controversial Parker v. Levy (1974). The book The Unlawful Concert by Fred Gardner (Viking Press, 1970) reviews the affair in detail. In 1980 the movie The Line depicted a fictionalized version of events. The episode is also examined in the 2005 documentary Sir! No Sir!, which examined military resistance to the Vietnam War. ==See also== * A Matter of Conscience * Brian Willson * Court-martial of Howard Levy * Concerned Officers Movement * Donald W.

The film is based upon a 1922 play of the same name, and was remade in 1933 with Mary Pickford in the leading role. Although the film was never released on video or DVD, copies still exist. ==Plot== The films opens in present. 75-year-old Mary Carlton is depressed over her husband John's illness. She feels her life has no use if he dies. She starts reading her diary, after which the film jumps to 1865 in the time she fell in love with John. She feels she has to hide her love for her strict mother, fearing she will disapprove because of their social class differences. Mary lives within the very wealthy Marlowe family and grows up to be a lady with manners, while John is a working class employee. When her parents find out about the affair, they are outrageous. They forbid her from ever seeing John again. However, Mary tells them she only loves John and will never marry anybody if she cannot see him anymore. Her father William locks her into her own room until she stops being a rebel. Meanwhile, she receives a letter from John, who announces he has been fired over their love affair. Later that night, John sneaks into her room by the balcony and announces he will leave for America. Despite knowing her parents will never talk to her again, she decides to go with him. Before they can leave, William comes in. He tells Mary he will send her to Scotland to live with her grandmother. After he leaves the room, Mary writes a farewell letter and sneaks off with John. By the time it's 1870, she lives with John in a poor house. He works all day, while Mary is giving birth to a son. One day, a gang threatens to kill John. He wants to surrender so they will not kill Mary and the baby as well, but Mary demands him to fight. He does as his wife tells him and eventually defeats the gang. Years pass by. In 1888, Mary celebrates her 39th birthday and is having contact with her family again. She finds out John is having a mistress, Estelle. Mary feels humiliated, but Estelle makes things worse when she confronts Mary with the fact she cannot make her husband happy. Mary grants her husband a divorce, but he does not want to leave her. He admits he has had an affair with Estelle, but that it didn't mean anything. They reunite, although John announces he has lost all of his money. The film goes back to present, where Mary is told her husband has recovered from his illness. ==Cast== Lobby card * Norma Talmadge as Mary Carlton * Eugene O‚ÄôBrien as John Carlton * Winter Hall as Dr. Arbuthnot * Frank Elliott as Robert Carlton * George Cowl as John Carlton Jr. * Clarissa Selwynne as Audrey Carlton * Florence Wix as Lady Lessington * Patterson Dial as Susan * Emily Fitzroy as Mrs. Marlowe * Claire McDowell as Elizabeth Channing * George Nichols as William Marlowe * Harvey Clark as Bob * Charles Stanton Ogle as Dr. McGovern * Donald Keith as John Carlton Jr. (1888) * Alice Day as Blanche Carlton (1888) * Mae Giraci as Audrey Carlton (1888) * Gertrude Astor as Mrs. Estelle Manwaring ==External links== * * Category:1924 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films directed by Frank Borzage Category:First National Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by Frances Marion Category:American drama films Category:1924 drama films ","title":"Secrets (1924 film)"},{"id":"20393695","text":"George Truelove (born 22 September 1975) is an English former professional rugby union and rugby league footballer. ==Background== Truelove was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England. ==Career== He played club level rugby union (RU) for Ballymena R.F.C., Saracens F.C., Bedford, Coventry R.F.C. and Union Sportive Bressane, as a Wing, i.e. number 11 or 14, and club level rugby league (RL) for the London Broncos, and the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, as a , i.e. number 2 or 5. ==References * (archived by web.archive.org) Statistics at premiershiprugby.com *National League 1 Preview * (archived by web.archive.org) Statistics at lequipe.fr *Saints in seventh heaven *Broncos hoping to buck trend *Broncos overcome by Wolves *Ulster stem Coventry comeback *Frew signs for Wildcats *Leeds on top form *Warriors tame Wildcats *Search for \\"George Truelove\\" at bbc.co.uk Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Ballymena R.F.C. players Category:Bedford Blues players Category:Coventry R.F.C. players Category:English rugby league players Category:English rugby union players Category:London Broncos players Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Rugby union wings Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Wakefield Trinity players ","title":"George Truelove"},{"id":"20393704","text":"Paul Hicks (born 22 June 1977) is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.

From 2009 to 2012, it was restored at the National Museum of Computing. In 2013, for the second time, the Guinness Book of World Records recognised it as the world's oldest working digital computer, following its restoration. It previously held the title for several years until it was decommissioned in 1973. The museum uses the computer's visual, dekatron-based memory to teach schoolchildren about computers. ==Construction and use at Harwell== The computer, which weighs , was built and used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire. Construction started in 1949, and the machine became operational in April 1951. It was handed over to the computing group in May 1952 and remained in use until 1957. It used dekatrons for volatile memory, similar to RAM in a modern computer, and paper tape for input and program storage. Relays were used for sequence control and valve-based (vacuum tube) electronics for calculations. Output was to either a Creed teleprinter or to a paper tape punch. The machine was decimal and initially had twenty eight-digit dekatron registers for internal storage, which was increased to 40 which appeared to be enough for nearly all calculations. It was assembled from components more commonly found in a British telephone exchange. The man who led the effort to rebuild the machine (see below) put it in perspective to the BBC: \\"All together, the machine can store 90 numbers. The closest analogy is a man with a pocket calculator,\\" Delwyn Holroyd, who led the restoration effort, tells the BBC in a video about the restoration. Although it could on occasions act as a true stored-program computer, that was not its normal mode of operation. It had a multiplication time of between 5 and 10 seconds, very slow for an electronic computer. As Ted Cooke-Yarborough wrote of his design in 1953 \\"a slow computer can only justify its existence if it is capable of running for long periods unattended and the time spent performing useful computations is a large proportion of the total time available\\". The design was noted for its reliability because in the period from May 1952 until February 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time. Dr Jack Howlett, Director of the Computer Laboratory at AERE 1948‚Äì61, said it \\"could be left unattended for long periods; I think the record was over one Christmas-New Year holiday when it was all by itself, with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy, for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back.\\" It was the machine's untiring durability, rather than its speed, that was its main feature. Human mathematicians (a job role called a \\"hand-computer\\") could make calculations at a similar speed, but not continuously for the same lengths of time. Dr Howlett commented: ==Subsequent use, renaming as the WITCH and disuse== The Harwell Dekatron Computer under restoration at the British National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park, March 2010. In 1957, at the end of its life at Harwell, the Oxford Mathematical Institute ran a competition to award it to the college that could produce the best case for its future use. The competition was the idea of John Hammersley, who had worked at AERE previously. The competition was won by the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College (which later became Wolverhampton University) where it was used to teach computing until 1973. The computer was renamed as the WITCH, the Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell. The WITCH was donated to the Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham in 1973. After the museum closed in 1997, the computer was disassembled and stored at the Birmingham City Council Museums Collection Centre.. ==Restoration== From September 2009, the machine was loaned to The National Museum of Computing in the site of Bletchley Park, where it began to be restored to working order as a Computer Conservation Society project. The museum, a registered charity, invited members of the public and industry to sponsor the restoration of the Harwell computer by purchasing one of 25 shares at ¬£4,500 each. In 2012, the restoration was completed successfully. ==More information== The complete computer viewed from the front A short book has been produced about the machine and the restoration project that also includes a brief technical description of the machine. There are also a series of short video recordings of the machine in operation on YouTube. A search for Harwell Dekatron will identify these. ==Painting== A painting of the machine, Portrait of a Dead Witch was made by the artist John Yeadon in 1983. After being exhibited at the 1984 at Leicestershire Schools and Colleges show, it was purchased by Leicestershire Local Education Authority and loaned to a local authority school, Newbridge High School, Coalville. Within two years of that school becoming a private academy school, the painting was sold at auction to an undisclosed private buyer. It was discovered on the wall of the Jam Street Cafe Bar in Manchester. Kaldip Bhamber, who has a fine arts degree, was unaware of the painting provenance when she purchased it; she wanted something large and colourful to fill a wall in her new enterprise. John Yeadon has visited the painting at its new location. ==See also== * List of vacuum tube computers * Electromechanical computer ==References. * . * . * . * * . * Category:1951 establishments in England Category:1957 disestablishments in England Category:Computer-related introductions in 1951 Category:1950s computers Category:Early British computers Category:One-of-a- kind computers Category:Vacuum tube computers Category:Electro-mechanical computers ","title":"Harwell computer"},{"id":"20393770","text":"Emil Holm (2 September 1877 - 1 January 1968) was a Finnish sport shooter who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics.

It is predominantly a volcanic unit comprising mainly basalts. It was formerly thought to contain sand stones containing the dinosaur Vulcanodon, however this was shown to be in error resulting from interpreting folding of the rocks as separate layers, with the sandstone layers actually being from the underlying Forest Sandstone. == Geology  Description === The formation is a volcanic unit, consisting mainly of high- titanium, low-potassium tholeiitic basalt flows, Pillow lavas in Batoka Basalt, Siyakobvu, Kariba District, Zimbabwe The lavas are dark, vesicular and porphyritic or massive basalts, with occasional pillows, although rare dacites and rhyolites have been reported from some areas of north-eastern Botswana. The vesicular and massive basalts occur in alternating bands, with the vesicular bands usually being the top and base of each flow. The basalt mineralogy consists of mainly of plagioclase, augite, magnetite, some ilmenite and volcanic glass. In the Hwange area, vesicles consist mostly of quartz, chalcedony or calcite, though zeolites, such as stilbite, mesolite and laumontite, are dominant towards Victoria Falls and in the lower Deka valley, and are common in north-eastern Botswana. The basalt lavas are related to carbonatite intrusions in the Zambezi valley. === Extent === The Batoka Formation is found in Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, in the Mid-Zambezi, Mana Pools and Cabora Bassa Basins. === Age === Lavas of the Batoka Formation have been dated at 180 to 179 Ma. === Stratigraphy === The Batoka Formation is the uppermost formation in the Upper Karoo Group of the Karoo Supergroup, lying above the Forest Sandstone Formation. The Batoka Formation has been correlated to the Drakensberg Group of the Great Karoo Basin, South Africa, and the basalts of the Tuli Basin in Botswana and Zimbabwe. == References == Category:Geologic formations of Botswana Category:Geologic formations of Zambia Category:Geologic formations of Zimbabwe Category:Jurassic System of Africa Category:Flood basalts ","title":"Batoka Formation"},{"id":"20393852","text":"Charles Harriss, 1903 Charles Albert Edward Harriss (16 or 17 December 1862 ‚Äì 31 July 1929) was an English then Canadian composer, impresario, educator, organist-choirmaster and conductor. Earnscliffe Residence in Ottawa, Ontario ==Early life and education== Harriss was born in London, England, around midnight between 16 and 17 December 1862. He was the son of Edwin Harriss, organist and choir conductor. He studied at St. Michael's College, Tenbury, with Sir Frederick Ouseley. Upon graduation, his first job was that of choir master at St. John's church in Wrexham, Wales. ==Career== At the age of 18 Harriss was appointed organist in a church in Welshpool, Wales. Through his teacher Ouseley's connections in Canada, and after a direct petition from Agnes Macdonald, wife of the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John Macdonald, Harriss was invited to audition for the job of organist at St. Alban the Martyr in Ottawa, Canada. After moving there in 1882, he became the organist at Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal (1883-1886). In 1886 Harriss succeeded his own father as organist in St. James the Apostle church, also in Montreal.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/harriss_charles_albert_edwin_15E.html Harriss composed a number of hymns and other choral works. His most famous composition is his opera Torquil, conceived firstly in 1896 as a piano-vocal score subtitled \\"a Scandinavian dramatic legend\\", on a text by Edward Oxenford. Even though structurally operatic, the composer warned in the score that it \\"may be sung by choral societies but must be given without custome or action\\". Torquil was premiered on 22 May 1900 at Massey Hall, Toronto, by the Boston Festival Orchestra with Harriss conducting.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/torquil-a- scandinavian-dramatic-legend-emc In 1894 Harriss became the founding director of the McGill Conservatorium of Music (today the Schulich School of Music), supervising 26 music instructors. He continued to compose religious music, including masses and cantatas.\\"Choral composition\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Harris organized a series of music festivals throughout Canada. In 1910 he published several patriotic works. He was also in charge or bringing the shining stars of the day to his newly adopted country, such as English baritone Charles Santley in 1891 and soprano Emma Albani in 1896. ==Personal== In 1897, Harriss married Ella Beatty-Shoenberger, daughter of John Beatty, M.D., Professor of Sciences in Victoria University, Cobourg, Ontario, and Eleanor Armstrong. She was the widow of the American industrialist George K. Shoenberger, who left her a considerable fortune. In 1900 the couple bought Lady Macdonald's Ottawa house, Earnscliffe.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/harriss_charles_albert_edwin_15E.html According to Nadia Turbide in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Harriss was a staunch British imperialist who sought to bring British cultural \\"standards\\" to the crown's dominions abroad.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/harriss_charles_albert_edwin_15E.html Charles A. E. Harriss is sometimes confused with his namesake and fellow composer, Charles Lewis Matthew Harris (1863-1925). Besides the similarity between their first and last names, the confusion is sparked by the fact that the latter was also an organist and choir master, also born in England (Staningly, Yorkshire) and who later (as a child) moved to Canada, eventually becoming the founder and first director of Hamilton Conservatory. ==Death and legacy== Harriss died in 1929.

The main plot revolves around two popular high school student football players (portrayed by Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto) who attend a cheerleading camp for the summer to get close to its 300 female cheerleaders. ==Plot== Nick Brady and Shawn Colfax are two popular football players at the fictional Gerald R. Ford High School who manage to get out of football camp and later con their way into the cheerleading squad after overhearing a conversation about the camp's abundant female population of 300 cheerleaders. Their objective is to infiltrate the cheerleading camp in order to meet girls. While attending a cheer camp, Nick and Shawn realize that they actually enjoy cheering and they start to care about their squad as well as the cheer competition. Shawn develops feelings for the head cheerleader, Carly Davidson, and Nick chases after Diora, their camp coach's wife. Carly and the rest of the squad soon find out about the boys' true motives for attending cheer camp. Carly's boyfriend, Dr. Rick, also reveals that guys initially planned to leave cheer camp before the cheer competition. They leave camp after being ejected from the squad. While attending a party at their friend's house, the guys discover that they are genuinely fond of cheer camp and want their squad to succeed. They decide to return to cheer camp and help the squad in the cheer competition. While the guys are doing their routine, Carly notices Rick is cheating on her with their rivals' head cheerleader, Gwyneth. Shawn and Carly later focus all of their attention to the routine. The squad's routine results in their best finish yet, with a perfect attempt at executing the \\"Fountain of Troy\\" maneuver. However, when the squad go for executing the forbidden maneuver, Shawn accidentally goes for a triple backflip instead of a double like Carly and backflips into the water in front of them. The crowd gasps at the impact and the squad rushes to help, but Shawn manages to emerge and yells \\"Tigers!\\" before losing consciousness. Although the squad did not win the contest, they place ten spots better than they did last year. The film ends when Nick and Shawn end up with their love interests, with Shawn and Carly kissing each other. ==CastProductionFilming locations=== Taking place in Illinois, almost all of the filming shots of the high school in the film were taken at South Pasadena High School in 2008. However, the hallway scene was filmed at John Burroughs High School in Burbank, California. To make filming easier, the fictional Gerald R. Ford High School's mascot was made the \\"Tigers\\" since South Pasadena High's mascot is a tiger. Some of the South Pasadena Tigers Football team's gear such as pads, were borrowed for use in the film. However, filming for the football game scene took place at Calabasas High School. The filming of the pool scene took place at Long Beach Polytechnic High School. The cheerleader camp was filmed at Occidental College, which incidentally also has the tiger as a mascot. In one of the early scenes, the train passing by is the Metro Gold Line (LACMTA) Pasadena line. The location where the cheerleaders were practicing was filmed in the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. ==ReceptionCritical response === When the film was released, it was screened to negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 25% based on 104 reviews, with an average score of 3.93/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Though not as raunchy or juvenile as the average teen comedy, Fired Up is also not as funny.\\" Metacritic gave the film a \\"generally unfavorable\\" score of 31% based on a normalized average of 18 reviews. A common criticism, addressed by director Will Gluck in the film's commentary track, is that the filmmakers \\"casted a little bit older.\\" Star Eric Christian Olsen adds, \\"If by 'older,' you mean thirteen years!\\" Lead actors Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto were playing high school students at the ages 30 and 27 at the time of filming, respectively. Gluck also points out Roger Ebert's and the New York Times's negative reviews specifically, as well as a mention of the Washington Post. He, however, omits the Washington Post's backhanded compliment that \\"Gluck directs with frantic, go-for-broke pacing, which is what you do when your reserves of wit are bankrupt.\\" One of the more positive reviews, from Hollywood.com, admits it's satisfying for the audience it's aimed towards: \\"An outrageous, sex-obsessed teen comedy that‚Äôs something to cheer about -- especially if you‚Äôre 16.\\" === Box office === The film was considered financially unsuccessful. Fired Up! had a budget of $20 million and took in a box office gross of $18,599,102 worldwide before leaving theaters. It opened up to the U.S. box office at number 9 with $5.4 million behind films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop, which was in its sixth week of release at the time, and Confessions of a Shopaholic, in its second. On the DVD commentary, the business it did (or lack thereof) is discussed, with director Will Gluck stating, \\"In retrospect, we probably should have done R, but I kind of like the idea of doing a movie that everyone can go see, and not just 'over 18 or have to sneak into it.'\\" It left American cinemas after seven weeks. ==Home media== The movie was released on DVD, UMD, and Blu-ray formats June 9, 2009. An unrated version was also released containing non-censored profanity and brief nudity not seen in the theatrical cut. Canadian singer Avril Lavigne's song \\"Girlfriend\\" was on the film's soundtrack.http://www.mlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/02/rah_rah_siss_boom_blah_awful_f.html ==References* * Category:2009 films Category:2009 comedy films Category:2009 directorial debut films Category:2000s high school films Category:2000s sex comedy films Category:2000s teen comedy films Category:American films Category:American high school films Category:American sex comedy films Category:American teen comedy films Category:Cheerleading films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Will Gluck Category:Films scored by Richard Gibbs Category:Films set in Illinois Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Teen sex comedy films ","title":"Fired Up!"},{"id":"20393981","text":"Secci√≥n de Acci√≥n Deportiva Club de F√∫tbol Internacional de Madrid Deportes Sociedad Limitada, simply known as Internacional de Madrid, Internacional or Inter de Madrid, is a male Spanish football team based in Boadilla del Monte, in the Community of Madrid.

Ritchie, Rittenhouse, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1994), pp. 1-24 ==Early life and career== Ritchie was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts on August 18, 1814, the son of John and Elizabeth Eliot Ritchie. As a young child Ritchie displayed a great aptitude for both the arts and mechanical sciences. After working as an amateur sculptor, he founded a business in 1850 with N.B. Chamberlain to manufacture mechanical and electrical instruments. Chamberlain eventually left, and Ritchie continued the business alone.American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. XXIII, May 1895 - May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896), pp. 359-360 ==Inventions and Innovations== In the early 1850s, after examining an example of an electric induction coil made by German instrument maker Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, which produced a small two-inch (50 mm) electric spark when energized, Ritchie perceived that it could be made more efficient and produce a longer spark by redesigning and improving its secondary insulation. His own design divided the coil into sections, each properly insulated from each other. Ritchie's first induction coil produced a spark 10 inches (25 cm) in length; a later perfected model produced a bolt two feet (60 cm) or longer in length.Rogers, W. B. (Prof.), Brief Account of the Construction and Effects of a very Powerful Induction Apparatus, devised by Mr. E.S. Ritchie, of Boston, United States, British Association for the Advancement of Science, Report of the Annual Meeting (1858), p. 15Page, Charles G., History of Induction: The American Claim to the Induction Coil and Its Electrostatic Developments, Boston: Harvard University, Intelligencer Printing house (1867), pp. 104-106American Academy, pp. 359-360 In 1857, one of Ritchie's induction coils was exhibited in Dublin, Ireland at a conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,Rogers, p. 15 and later at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.American Academy, pp. 359-360 Intrigued, Ruhmkorff himself procured a sample of the Ritchie induction coil and used it as a basis for revising his own design.American Academy, pp. 359-360Page, pp. 104-106 The German inventor was later awarded a scientific prize by Napoleon III. Disappointed in not receiving recognition for his improvements, Ritchie turned his attention to navigational instruments. Ritchie began making marine bearing compasses for the U.S. Navy before the American Civil War. At the time, British Admiralty dry-mount nautical compasses were considered by all navies and merchant shipping companies as the technological standard of the day. Ritchie thought they could be improved upon, and by 1860 had received a U.S. patent for the first successful and practicable liquid-filled marine compass suitable for general use,Gubbins, David, Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism, Springer Press (2007), , , p. 67: In 1690, Sir Edmund Halley demonstrated a rudimentary working model of a liquid compass at a meeting of the Royal Society.Fanning, A.E., Steady As She Goes: A History of the Compass Department of the Admiralty, HMSO, Department of the Admiralty (1986), : The first liquid-filled mariner's compass to receive a patent as a working model was a nautical design invented by Englishman Francis Crow in 1813. a development that has been described as the first major advance in compass technology in several hundred years.Warner, pp. 1-24 With the damping provided by the liquid, together with a gimbal mounting, the floating indicator or card of the Ritchie compass remained relatively stable even when a ship's deck pitched and rolled during periods of severe weather. In Ritchie's third patent application (#38,126) dated April 7, 1863, several features that contributed to the success of his compass are revealed, including a floating card of nearly the same specific gravity as the liquid, an air-tight metallic case, and an elastic chamber that served as a diaphragm, compensating for temperature changes and resultant unequal expansion of the liquid and the bowl. Ritchie liquid-filled nautical compasses soon became a U.S. Navy standard, and were also widely used by American merchant mariners. He also invented an improved theodolite which was immediately adopted by the U.S. Navy for measuring harbors and port entrances.American Academy, pp. 359-360 The business he began in 1850 became E. S. Ritchie & Son in 1866 and E. S. Ritchie & Sons in 1867, and moved from Boston to new facilities in Brookline in 1886.Warner, pp. 1-24 The company specializes in manufacturing compasses, astro-navigation devices, and other nautical equipment for all types of ships, including small hand-bearing compasses for recreational and amateur sailing vessels. ==Epilogue== Following Ritchie‚Äôs death in 1895, his sons transferred the scientific instruments to the L. E. Knott Apparatus Co., while retaining the nautical instrument line. The firm was incorporated as E.S. Ritchie & Sons, Inc. in 1939, and continues operations to the present day.Ritchie Navigation, About Us, Article It is now located in Pembroke, Massachusetts, and known as Ritchie Navigation.Warner, pp. 1-24 ==Museum Displays== A model of Ritchie's first liquid-filled compass in the collections of the Science Museum (London). ==NotesReferences== * American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. XXIII, May 1895 - May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896) * Page, Charles G., History of Induction: The American Claim to the Induction Coil and Its Electrostatic Developments, Boston: Harvard University, Intelligencer Printing house (1867) * Rogers, W.

Bernstein. CubeHash has a 128 byte state, uses wide pipe construction, and is ARX based. Message blocks are XORed into the initial bits of a 128-byte state, which then goes through an r-round bijective transformation between blocks. The initial NIST proposal (\\"Cubehash8/1\\") required about 200 cycles per byte. After clarifications from NIST, the author changed the proposal to Cubehash16/32, which \\"is approximately 16 times faster than CubeHash8/1, easily catching up to both SHA-256 and SHA-512 on the reference platform\\" while still maintaining a \\"comfortable security margin\\". CubeHash advanced to the second round of the competition, but was not chosen as one of the 5 finalists. Bernstein has since tuned the parameters further and his main recommendation is CubeHash512, defined as CubeHash16+16/32+32‚Äì512. ==How it works== This description refers to the latest specification, and not the NIST submission. CubeHash has 5 parameters, a certain instance is denoted by CubeHashi+r/b+f-h. * i is the number of initial rounds * r is the number of rounds per block * b is the block size in bytes, defined for {1, 2, 3, ... 128} * f is the number of final rounds * h is the size of the hash output in bits, defined for {8, 16, 24, 32, ... 512} In the original NIST submission, i and f was fixed to 10r. The obsolete notation CubeHashr/b-h indicates i and f being implicitly 10r. The internal state is defined as a five-dimensional array of words (four-byte integers), 0-1 in both dimensions. The words are referred to with their coordinates [00000] to [11111]. The words are treated as little-endian. The internal state is initialized by setting the first three words ([00000], [00001], [00010]) to h/8, b, and r respectively, all other words to zero. The state is then run through i rounds, and the initialization stage is complete. The state is now the Initialization Vector (IV). The IV can be saved and reused for a given combination of h, b, r. The message is padded and split to b-byte blocks. The padding appends a 1 bit, followed by as many 0 bits as necessary to make a complete block. Each block is inputted by XORing to the first b bytes of the state, and then performing r rounds of transformation. Finally, 1 is XORed to the state word [11111], and then f rounds of transformation are performed. The output hash is now contained in the first h/8 bytes of this final state. === Round Function === The ten steps of the mixing function. Two of the five dimensions are unrolled. CubeHash round function consists of the following ten steps: # Add x[0jklm] into x[1jklm] modulo 2, for each (j,k,l,m). # Rotate x[0jklm] upwards by 7 bits, for each (j,k,l,m). # Swap x[00klm] with x[01klm], for each (k,l,m). # Xor x[1jklm] into x[0jklm], for each (j,k,l,m). # Swap x[1jk0m] with x[1jk1m], for each (j,k,m). # Add x[0jklm] into x[1jklm] modulo 2, for each (j,k,l,m). # Rotate x[0jklm] upwards by 11 bits, for each (j,k,l,m). # Swap x[0j0lm] with x[0j1lm], for each (j,l,m). # Xor x[1jklm] into x[0jklm], for each (j,k,l,m). # Swap x[1jkl0] with x[1jkl1], for each (j,k,l). ==Example Hashes== This example uses CubeHash80+8/1+80-512. The initialization vector is the same for all 80+8/1+f-512 hashes, and is as follows: 5df39869c73009fb108994600f1626e6f37c07360c0d8bb53d19cf57b8e74133\\\\ 5b8034a3eff9892014c4ff315038ef2a391812fe52a440e9a293527d12ca4570\\\\ 6e0958933470bf814aa4909adb3ec39384e9c314d0db874af21d45bcacb31252\\\\ 1ce5ab6a3bf6f05de88abbdd0fcfd3fafb8225d546242eada52540095c3da221 Hashing the ASCII message \\"Hello\\" (hex: 0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f) uses 6 message blocks. There are 5 blocks from the message, and since this is a byte- aligned input, there is 1 block for padding. The 512 bit hash value is: 7ce309a25e2e1603ca0fc369267b4d43f0b1b744ac45d6213ca08e7567566444\\\\ 8e2f62fdbf7bbd637ce40fc293286d75b9d09e8dda31bd029113e02ecccfd39b A small change in the message, such as flipping a single bit, will wildly change the hash output, due to the avalanche effect. Hashing the message \\"hello\\" (which only differs from \\"Hello\\" in 1 bit position) gives the following hash value: 01ee7f4eb0e0ebfdb8bf77460f64993faf13afce01b55b0d3d2a63690d25010f\\\\ 7127109455a7c143ef12254183e762b15575e0fcc49c79a0471a970ba8a66638 ===Parameter Changes=== CubeHash allows for many different parameters to be used to determine the hash output. It is up to the user to decide which parameters they wish to use. Here are several example hashes of different messages, using different parameters. The messages are all in ASCII. message: \\"\\" (the zero-length string) CubeHash160+16/32+160-512: 4a1d00bbcfcb5a9562fb981e7f7db3350fe2658639d948b9d57452c22328bb32\\\\ f468b072208450bad5ee178271408be0b16e5633ac8a1e3cf9864cfbfc8e043a CubeHash80+8/1+80-512: 90bc3f2948f7374065a811f1e47a208a53b1a2f3be1c0072759ed49c9c6c7f28\\\\ f26eb30d5b0658c563077d599da23f97df0c2c0ac6cce734ffe87b2e76ff7294 CubeHash10+1/1+10-512: 3f917707df9acd9b94244681b3812880e267d204f1fdf795d398799b584fa8f1\\\\ f4a0b2dbd52fd1c4b6c5e020dc7a96192397dd1bce9b6d16484049f85bb71f2f CubeHash160+16/32+160-256: 44c6de3ac6c73c391bf0906cb7482600ec06b216c7c54a2a8688a6a42676577d CubeHash80+8/1+80-256: 38d1e8a22d7baac6fd5262d83de89cacf784a02caa866335299987722aeabc59 CubeHash10+1/1+10-256: 80f72e07d04ddadb44a78823e0af2ea9f72ef3bf366fd773aa1fa33fc030e5cb message: \\"Hello\\" CubeHash160+16/32+160-512: dcc0503aae279a3c8c95fa1181d37c418783204e2e3048a081392fd61bace883\\\\ a1f7c4c96b16b4060c42104f1ce45a622f1a9abaeb994beb107fed53a78f588c CubeHash80+8/1+80-512: 7ce309a25e2e1603ca0fc369267b4d43f0b1b744ac45d6213ca08e7567566444\\\\ 8e2f62fdbf7bbd637ce40fc293286d75b9d09e8dda31bd029113e02ecccfd39b CubeHash10+1/1+10-512: 13cf99c1a71e40b135f5535bee02e151eb4897e4de410b9cb6d7179c677074eb\\\\ 6ef1ae9a9e685ef2d2807509541f484d39559525179d53838eda95eb3f6a401d CubeHash160+16/32+160-256: e712139e3b892f2f5fe52d0f30d78a0cb16b51b217da0e4acb103dd0856f2db0 CubeHash80+8/1+80-256: 692638db57760867326f851bd2376533f37b640bd47a0ddc607a9456b692f70f CubeHash10+1/1+10-256: f63041a946aa98bd47f3175e6009dcb2ccf597b2718617ba46d56f27ffe35d49 message: \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\" CubeHash160+16/32+160-512: bdba44a28cd16b774bdf3c9511def1a2baf39d4ef98b92c27cf5e37beb8990b7\\\\ cdb6575dae1a548330780810618b8a5c351c1368904db7ebdf8857d596083a86 CubeHash80+8/1+80-512: ca942b088ed9103726af1fa87b4deb59e50cf3b5c6dcfbcebf5bba22fb39a6be\\\\ 9936c87bfdd7c52fc5e71700993958fa4e7b5e6e2a3672122475c40f9ec816ba CubeHash10+1/1+10-512: eb7f5f80706e8668c61186c3c710ce57f9094fbfa1dbdc7554842cdbb4d10ce4\\\\ 2fce72736d10b152f6216f23fc648bce810a7af4d58e571ec1b852fa514a0a8e CubeHash160+16/32+160-256: 5151e251e348cbbfee46538651c06b138b10eeb71cf6ea6054d7ca5fec82eb79 CubeHash80+8/1+80-256: 94e0c958d85cdfaf554919980f0f50b945b88ad08413e0762d6ff0219aff3e55 CubeHash10+1/1+10-256: 217a4876f2b24cec489c9171f85d53395cc979156ea0254938c4c2c59dfdf8a4 The Initialization Vectors for the four variants shown are all different as well. For example, the Initialization Vector for CubeHash80+8/1+80-512 can be seen above, and the IV for CubeHash80+8/1+80-256 is: 830b2bd5273d616fd785876a4a500218a5388963eeb702fb47547842459f8d89\\\\ 8727a1c8ba40bd48cef47fe82543c2735c033052ae9fcd632d4541bde6b6cb0d\\\\ cb8a9cdf579f5b67b2ae00968180af6e51ebdf0ca597cd2bf91f981f7ab29a62\\\\ 01ad72d946e6c075c6d1337e0a293d6f90c438ac38be153f32aa288ffc5eca8a ==Security== The strength of this function increases as b decreases towards 1, and as r increases. So CubeHash 8/1-512 is stronger (more secure) than CubeHash 1/1-512, and CubeHash 1/1-512 is stronger than CubeHash 1/2-512. The weakest possible version of this algorithm is CubeHash 1/128-h. However, there is a security versus time tradeoff. A more secure version will take longer to compute a hash value than a weakened version. ==References External links == * The CubeHash web site Category:NIST hash function competition ","title":"CubeHash"},{"id":"20394413","text":"The Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, more commonly known as the Lausanne Movement, is a global movement that mobilizes evangelical leaders to collaborate for world evangelization. The stated vision is \\"the whole church taking the whole gospel to the whole world\\". The Lausanne Movement grew out of the 1974 International Congress on World Evangelization (ICOWE) and promotes active worldwide evangelism. The Lausanne Covenant provides the theological basis for collaborative work in the area of mission and evangelism. The Cape Town Commitment defines the movement's goals. ==History== The First International Congress on World Evangelization met in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974. Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the Global South, Volume 2, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 451It was organized in part by Billy Graham and was attended by some 2,500 participants and guests from over 150 nations who met here to discuss and promote evangelism. George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christian Education, Volume 3, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2015, p. 1463One result of this conference was the Lausanne Continuation Committee, which planned to sustain the movement started at Lausanne. This committee formed the backbone for the official inception of the LCWE in 1976. Another organizational backbone of the movement was the Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center (MARC), a division of World Vision International. ==Organization== The Lausanne board of directors is chaired by Ram Gidoomal. The newly appointed executive director/CEO is Michael Oh, who succeeds Doug Birdsall. Board members include leaders from around the world.Lausanne Leadership, from Lausanne.org ==Significance== Lausanne has spawned significant involvement from agencies and individual Christians. The movement surrounding it has led to hundreds of books on evangelism and theology being published. These include workbooks for choosing strategies with which to evangelize to \\"unreached peoples\\".Edward R. Dayton, David Allen Fraser. Planning Strategies for World Evangelism Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1990 The documents of greatest significance to date are The Lausanne Covenant, which is used by evangelical mission organisations worldwide as a basis for faith, action and partnership, and The Cape Town Commitment which is \\"in two parts. Part l sets out biblical convictions, passed down to us in the scriptures, and Part ll sounds the call to action.\\" ==Publications== Lausanne's most recent publications include Christ Our Reconciler, from Cape Town 2010. Lausanne also publishes occasional papers on its website. The series of booklets, The Didasko Files, includes some Lausanne Movement documents such as a study guide to The Lausanne Covenant, written by the chief architect of the covenant, John Stott. ==Cape Town 2010== At the urging of evangelical leaders worldwide, the Lausanne Movement held the Third Congress on World Evangelisation in Cape Town, South Africa, October 16‚Äì25, 2010, at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Matthew Cresswell, What future for the Lausanne movement?, theguardian.com, UK, October 21, 2010 Maria Mackay, Historic Lausanne Declaration Calls World's Evangelicals to Action, christianpost.com, USA, January 28, 2011 The goal of Cape Town 2010 was to re-stimulate the spirit of Lausanne represented in the Lausanne Covenant: to promote unity, humbleness in service, and a call to action for global evangelization. It was attended by 4,000 participants and 1000 guests from 197 countries. During this congress the Cape Town Commitment was developed and subsequently published. == Criticism of Christian Zionism == Steve Haas, vice president of Lausanne, gave a sermon on social justice, published in the movement's journal, All of Me, linking problems with the way evangelicals approached the Rwanda crisis, the AIDS epidemic and the subject of Zionism. This was described as using \\"outrageously broad brushstrokes\\" and the comparison with the Spanish Inquisition and the crusades was called \\"clumsy\\". Christian Zionism or Restorationism has been a widely held Protestant conviction before and after the Declaration of Independence by the State of Israel. Robert Stearns, executive director of Eagles' Wings, described the article in Lausanne's journal as a \\"narrow and dangerously one-sided presentation\\", and described it as an \\"all-out assault on Christian Zionists\\". Among other arguments he cited the prominent role of Arabs in Israeli society to address Haas' support of the assertion that Israel is \\"apartheid on steroids\\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center described this last claim as \\"the big lie\\", and rebutted the \\"dismissal of the validity of Israel's right to exist as the Jewish State\\". World Vision International described the comments in the article as \\"unhelpfully simplified and combative\\". Jan van 't Loo, the spokesman for World Vision Netherlands stated that this response does not reflect World Vision's position on for Israel and the Palestinian people and it appeared without the proper approval. Blogging for the Times of Israel, Sam Hailes commends part of Haas's article as important to study, but condemns the fact that the article \\"never even tries to use equal terms\\" for Israelis and Palestinians.

The cartridge was briefly adopted by the United States Army, around 1871. The Army used it until 1873, at which time it was replaced by the better known and more powerful .45 Colt cartridge used in the recently adopted Colt Single Action Army revolver. The .44 Colt was made for use in the Richards-Mason conversion of Colt's 1860 Army percussion revolver. The conversion process involved boring through the chambers of the obsolete cap and ball revolvers and adding a breech-plate with a gated loading port to enable them to chamber centerfire metallic cartridges. This process left a chamber of uniform diameter, with no step at the front. Thus the bullet and the brass case were made the same diameter, approximately .451-.454\\", with a short \\"heel\\" section at the base of the bullet of smaller diameter inserted in the mouth of the case, similar to the construction of .22 rimfire ammunition. Modern .44 Colt ammunition is dimensionally similar to .44 Special with regard to bullet diameter and case width, the main exceptions being the shorter case length and smaller rim diameter. ==Ballistics== The original .44 Colt loading used a heeled, outside lubricated bullet. The major diameter of the bullet was approximately the groove diameter (.451\\") of the converted \\".44\\" cap and ball revolver. The smaller \\"heel\\" at the base of the bullet was sized to fit inside the brass case at approximately .430\\". Upon firing, the ductile soft lead bullet (alloys of pure to nearly pure lead were used) allowed the base of the bullet to \\"bump up\\" to first the chamber diameter in the cylinder, then jump the gap, through the forcing cone into the rifling. This is effective with black powder, but less so with smokeless powder. Alloying the lead with tin or antimony to harden it makes this nearly impossible. Use of hard alloys typically leads to poor accuracy. Benet cup and Martin-type primers were later replaced by more reliable Boxer type primers. The ballistic performance of the original .44 Colt is comparable to the .44 Remington, and less powerful than modern .44 Russian loads. Cases for the modern \\".44 Colt\\" chambered handguns are typically made using trimmed .44 Magnum, .44 Special, or .44 Russian brass and a historically inaccurate .429 lead bullet. (As opposed to the older \\"heeled bullets\\" with a larger .451\\" diameter outside lubricated bullet.).sixguns.com Commercial black powder and smokeless ammunition remained available until around 1940, by which time the .44 Colt had been entirely supplanted by more modern handgun cartridges such as the .38 Special and .44 Special. The modern sport of Cowboy Action Shooting has stimulated renewed interest in obsolete revolver cartridges like .44 Colt and, for the first time in nearly 100 years, commercially produced .44 Colt ammunition is available. Brass is available from Starline and can be made by trimming the length of .44 Special cases. ==See also== *List of cartridges by caliber *11mm caliber ==ReferencesSources== *Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T.

Alongside with poetry, ZƒÅlƒ´te has written drama. In the 1980s, the writer focused more on the philosophical and emotional motifs combining history and modern times as well as referencing ongoing social and political issues, often associated with Latvian culture and mythology.

In 1935 and 1936 he was a nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature.Nobel Prize Nominee Database His works were banned in Latvian SSR until 1985. == Biography == Edvarts Virza was born as Jƒìkabs Eduards Liekna in RƒÅce≈Üi homestead, Salgale parish, Courland Governorate on December 27, 1883. He was oldest of nine children and his father Juris Liekna was a relatively wealthy farmer. Edvarts attended local parish school and later studied in Bauska town school from witch he graduated in 1901. In 1902 he started studies in technical school of post and telegraph in Riga. However he soon left his studies and in 1904 traveled to Moscow where he attended law lectures in Moscow University. During Russian revolution of 1905 he returned to Latvia and lived in his family home where he studied french language and poetry of Russian symbolists. In 1906 his first poem was printed in newspaper and in 1907 his first collection of poetry Biƒ∑eris was published. During First world war in summer of 1915 German army with little resistance occupied Kurzeme and invaded into Zemgale forcing thousands of Latvians to leave their homes and travel as refugees to Vidzeme or further east to inner Russia. Also family of Edvarts Virza left Zemgale but Edvarts enlisted in 5th. Zemgale Latvian Rifleman regiment under command of Jukums VƒÅcietis in 1916. In 1917 he together with majority of Latvian rifleman went to Russia and settled in Saint Petersburg. While in Petersburg he was addressed by members of Latvian Provisional National Council and wrote extensive and analytical article Izpostƒ´tƒÅ Latvija (Devastated Latvia) about German - Russian war in Baltic area and senseless heroism of latvian soldiers while fighting in foreign army. Article was intended for Entente countries to inform them about situation in Baltic area. Virza also translated this article into french. In 1918 Virza was demobilised from army and returned to Latvia. During Latvian War of Independence Virza worked for several newspapers and his articles and patriotic poems were published regularly. In January 1919, under bolshevik pressure, Virza together with the Provisional government left Riga and evacuated to LiepƒÅja. After pro German coup in April 1919 Virza traveled from LiepƒÅja by sea to Tallinn and from there to Valka where latvian military units still loyal to provisional government was located. While in Valka he together with Oto NonƒÅcs and Jƒìkabs Jan≈°evskis published newspaper Tautas Balss (Voice of the nation). Despite its short life this newspaper with clear pro latvian position became one of the symbols of free Latvia. In autumn of 1919 when the attack of the West Russian volunteer army began Virza lived in Riga and worked in the editorial staff of the military newspaper Latvijas Kareivis (Soldier of Latvia) together with his friend poet Viktors Eglƒ´tis and fellow writer Aleksandrs Grƒ´ns.

During period of soviet occupation works of Edvarts Virza were banned and there was no mention of him in literature books. == Literature == Edvarts Virza is considered as first latvian symbolist in poetry. His first collection Biƒ∑eris in 1907 is not only bright example of latvian symbolism but also first example of erotic poetry in latvian literature. His later works are mostly neo classical however they have many aspects of romanticism as well. During period of Republic of Latvia main themes of Virzas poetry was patriotism and beauty of nature. In 1933 he finished poem (actually a prose work) Straumƒìni which is today included in Latvian cultural canon. This work describes idealised peasant life in Zemgale during 1880ties. It combines Virzas own childhood memories with tales of his grandparents. After K. Ulmanis coup in May 1934 Virza became one of the K. Ulmanis favorite poets, he actively took part in regime propaganda and wrote many poems and articles which promote country life, peasant work and patriotism. In 1935 he also published a book about KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1940 deaths Category:People from Ozolnieki Municipality Category:People from Courland Governorate Category:Latvian Farmers' Union politicians Category:Latvian writers Category:Latvian journalists Category:Latvian male poets Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Burials at Forest Cemetery, Riga Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Edvarts Virza"},{"id":"20394468","text":"Faltonius Restitutianus (died 252) was a vir egrerius or eques who held several senior-level posts in the Roman Empire of the third century.

Although part of the same series of standards, SHA-3 is internally different from the MD5-like structure of SHA-1 and SHA-2. SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak ( or ), designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Micha√´l Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche, building upon RadioGat√∫n. Keccak's authors have proposed additional uses for the function, not (yet) standardized by NIST, including a stream cipher, an authenticated encryption system, a \\"tree\\" hashing scheme for faster hashing on certain architectures, Sections 5.1.2.1 (mentioning \\"tree mode\\"), 6.2 (\\"other features\\", mentioning authenticated encryption), and 7 (saying \\"extras\\" may be standardized in the future). and AEAD ciphers Keyak and Ketje. Keccak is based on a novel approach called sponge construction. Sponge construction is based on a wide random function or random permutation, and allows inputting (\\"absorbing\\" in sponge terminology) any amount of data, and outputting (\\"squeezing\\") any amount of data, while acting as a pseudorandom function with regard to all previous inputs. This leads to great flexibility. NIST does not currently plan to withdraw SHA-2 or remove it from the revised Secure Hash Standard. The purpose of SHA-3 is that it can be directly substituted for SHA-2 in current applications if necessary, and to significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit. The creators of the Keccak algorithms and the SHA-3 functions suggest using the faster function KangarooTwelve with adjusted parameters and a new tree hashing mode without extra overhead for small message sizes. ==History== The Keccak algorithm is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen (who also co-designed the Rijndael cipher with Vincent Rijmen), Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. It is based on earlier hash function designs PANAMA and RadioGat√∫n. PANAMA was designed by Daemen and Craig Clapp in 1998. RadioGat√∫n, a successor of PANAMA, was designed by Daemen, Peeters, and Van Assche, and was presented at the NIST Hash Workshop in 2006. The reference implementation source code was dedicated to public domain via CC0 waiver.KeccakReferenceAndOptimized-3.2.zip mainReference.c \\"The Keccak sponge function, designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Micha√´l Peeters and Gilles Van Assche.

SHA-3 is not meant to replace SHA-2, as no significant attack on SHA-2 has been demonstrated. Because of the successful attacks on MD5, SHA-0 and SHA-1, NIST perceived a need for an alternative, dissimilar cryptographic hash, which became SHA-3. After a setup period, admissions were to be submitted by the end of 2008. Keccak was accepted as one of the 51 candidates. In July 2009, 14 algorithms were selected for the second round. Keccak advanced to the last round in December 2010. During the competition, entrants were permitted to \\"tweak\\" their algorithms to address issues that were discovered. Changes that have been made to Keccak are: * The number of rounds was increased from to to be more conservative about security. * The message padding was changed from a more complex scheme to the simple 10*1 pattern described below. * The rate r was increased to the security limit, rather than rounding down to the nearest power of 2. On October 2, 2012, Keccak was selected as the winner of the competition. In 2014, the NIST published a draft FIPS 202 \\"SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions\\". FIPS 202 was approved on August 5, 2015. On August 5, 2015 NIST announced that SHA-3 had become a hashing standard. ==Design== collision or preimage attacks. SHA-3 uses the sponge construction, in which data is \\"absorbed\\" into the sponge, then the result is \\"squeezed\\" out. In the absorbing phase, message blocks are XORed into a subset of the state, which is then transformed as a whole using a permutation function f. In the \\"squeeze\\" phase, output blocks are read from the same subset of the state, alternated with the state transformation function f. The size of the part of the state that is written and read is called the \\"rate\\" (denoted r), and the size of the part that is untouched by input/output is called the \\"capacity\\" (denoted c). The capacity determines the security of the scheme. The maximum security level is half the capacity. Given an input bit string N, a padding function pad, a permutation function f that operates on bit blocks of width b, a rate r and an output length d, we have capacity c = b - r and the sponge construction Z = \\\\text{sponge}[f,pad,r](N,d), yielding a bit string Z of length d, works as follows: * pad the input N using the pad function, yielding a padded bit string P with a length divisible by r (such that n = \\\\text{len}(P)/r is integer) * break P into n consecutive r-bit pieces P0, ..., Pn‚àí1 * initialize the state S to a string of b zero bits * absorb the input into the state: for each block Pi: ** extend Pi at the end by a string of c zero bits, yielding one of length b ** XOR that with S ** apply the block permutation f to the result, yielding a new state S * initialize Z to be the empty string * while the length of Z is less than d: ** append the first r bits of S to Z ** if Z is still less than d bits long, apply f to S, yielding a new state S * truncate Z to d bits The fact that the internal state S contains c additional bits of information in addition to what is output to Z prevents the length extension attacks that SHA-2, SHA-1, MD5 and other hashes based on the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction are susceptible to. In SHA-3, the state S consists of a array of w-bit words (with w = 64), b = 5 √ó 5 √ó w = 5 √ó 5 √ó 64 = 1600 bits total. Keccak is also defined for smaller power-of-2 word sizes w down to 1 bit (total state of 25 bits). Small state sizes can be used to test cryptanalytic attacks, and intermediate state sizes (from , 200 bits, to , 800 bits) can be used in practical, lightweight applications. For SHA-3-224, SHA-3-256, SHA-3-384, and SHA-3-512 instances, r is greater than d, so there is no need for additional block permutations in the squeezing phase; the leading d bits of the state are the desired hash. However, SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 allow an arbitrary output length, which is useful in applications such as optimal asymmetric encryption padding. ==Padding== To ensure the message can be evenly divided into r-bit blocks, padding is required. SHA-3 uses the pattern 10*1 in its padding function: a 1 bit, followed by zero or more 0 bits (maximum ) and a final 1 bit. The maximum of zero bits occurs when the last message block is bits long. Then another block is added after the initial 1 bit, containing zero bits before the final 1 bit. The two 1 bits will be added even if the length of the message is already divisible by r. In this case, another block is added to the message, containing a 1 bit, followed by a block of zero bits and another 1 bit. This is necessary so that a message with length divisible by r ending in something that looks like padding does not produce the same hash as the message with those bits removed. The initial 1 bit is required so messages differing only in a few additional 0 bits at the end do not produce the same hash. The position of the final 1 bit indicates which rate r was used (multi-rate padding), which is required for the security proof to work for different hash variants. Without it, different hash variants of the same short message would be the same up to truncation. ==The block permutation== The block transformation f, which is Keccak-f[1600] for SHA-3, is a permutation that uses XOR, AND and NOT operations, and is designed for easy implementation in both software and hardware. It is defined for any power-of-two word size, bits. The main SHA-3 submission uses 64-bit words, . The state can be considered to be a array of bits. Let be bit of the input, using a little-endian bit numbering convention and row-major indexing. I.e. selects the row, the column, and the bit. Index arithmetic is performed modulo 5 for the first two dimensions and modulo w for the third. The basic block permutation function consists of rounds of five steps: ; (theta) : Compute the parity of each of the (320, when ) 5-bit columns, and exclusive-or that into two nearby columns in a regular pattern. To be precise, ; (rho) : Bitwise rotate each of the 25 words by a different triangular number 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, .... To be precise, a[0][0] is not rotated, and for all , , where \\\\begin{pmatrix} i \\\\\\\\\\\\ j \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}^t \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. ; (pi) : Permute the 25 words in a fixed pattern. . ; (chi) : Bitwise combine along rows, using . To be precise, . This is the only non-linear operation in SHA-3. ; (iota) : Exclusive-or a round constant into one word of the state. To be precise, in round , for , is XORed with bit of a degree-8 LFSR sequence. This breaks the symmetry that is preserved by the other steps. ==Speed== The speed of SHA-3 hashing of long messages is dominated by the computation of f = Keccak-f[1600] and XORing S with the extended Pi, an operation on b = 1600 bits. However, since the last c bits of the extended Pi are 0 anyway, and XOR with 0 is a NOP, it is sufficient to perform XOR operations only for r bits (r = 1600 ‚àí 2 √ó 224 = 1152 bits for SHA3-224, 1088 bits for SHA3-256, 832 bits for SHA3-384 and 576 bits for SHA3-512). The lower r is (and, conversely, the higher c = b ‚àí r = 1600 ‚àí r), the less efficient but more secure the hashing becomes since fewer bits of the message can be XORed into the state (a quick operation) before each application of the computationally expensive f. The authors report the following speeds for software implementations of Keccak-f[1600] plus XORing 1024 bits, which roughly corresponds to SHA3-256: *57.4 cpb on IA-32, Intel Pentium 3\\"about 41 cycles/byte [...] represents a 40% speedup compared to an implementation using only 32-bit instructions\\". By formula \\\\frac1x\\\\times 1.40 = \\\\frac1{41} we obtain x=57.4 *41 cpb on IA-32+MMX, Intel Pentium 3 *20 cpb on IA-32+SSE, Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 *12.6 cpb on a typical x86-64-based machine *6‚Äì7 cpb on IA-64 For the exact SHA3-256 on x86-64, Bernstein measures 11.7‚Äì12.25 cpb depending on the CPU. SHA-3 has been criticized for being slow on instruction set architectures (CPUs) which do not have instructions meant specially for computing Keccak functions faster ‚Äì SHA2-512 is more than twice as fast as SHA3-512, and SHA-1 is more than three times as fast on an Intel Skylake processor clocked at 3.2 GHz. The authors have reacted to this criticism by suggesting to use SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 instead of SHA3-256 and SHA3-512, at the expense of cutting the preimage resistance in half (but while keeping the collision resistance). With this, performance is on par with SHA2-256 and SHA2-512. However, in hardware implementations, SHA-3 is notably faster than all other finalists, Keccak is second only to Luffa, which did not advance to the final round. and also faster than SHA-2 and SHA-1. ARM's ARMv8ARM corporation, ARM architecture reference manual ARMv8, for ARMv8-A architecture profile, document ARM DDI 0487C.a (ID121917), https://www.arm.com and IBM's s390x architectures already (as of 2018) include special instructions which enable Keccak algorithms to execute faster. ==Instances== The NIST standard defines the following instances, for message M and output length d: {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Instance ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Output size d ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Rate r = block size ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Capacity c ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Definition ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Security strengths in bits - !

Meaning -  style=\\"text-align: right;\\"  ...0  reserved for future use -  style=\\"text- align: right;\\"  01  SHA-3 -  style=\\"text-align: right;\\"  ...11  RawSHAKE } RawSHAKE is the basis for the Sakura coding for tree hashing, which has not been standardized yet. However, the SHAKE suffix has been carefully chosen so that it is forward compatible with Sakura. Sakura appends 0 for a chaining hop or 1 for a message, then 10*0 for a non-final (inner) node or 1 for a final node, before it applies RawSHAKE. Sequential hashing corresponds to a hop tree with a single message node, which means that 11 is appended to the message before RawSHAKE is applied. Thus, the SHAKE XOFs append 1111 to the message, i.e., 1 for message, 1 for final node, and 11 for the RawSHAKE domain separation suffix. Since 10*1 padding always adds at least two bits, in byte-aligned libraries there are always six unused zero bits. Therefore, these appended extra bits never make the padded message longer. == Additional instances == In December 2016 NIST published a new document, NIST SP.800-185,SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC, TupleHash and ParallelHash describing additional SHA-3 derived functions: {  ! Instance !! Description -  cSHAKE128(X, L, N, S) rowspan=\\"2\\" A version of SHAKE supporting explicit domain separation via customization parameters. -  cSHAKE256(X, L, N, S) -  KMAC128(K, X, L, S) rowspan=\\"4\\" A keyed hash function based on Keccak. Can also be used without a key as a regular hash function. -  KMAC256(K, X, L, S) -  KMACXOF128(K, X, L, S) -  KMACXOF256(K, X, L, S) -  TupleHash128(X, L, S) rowspan=\\"4\\" A function for hashing tuples of strings. The output of this function depends on both the contents and the sequence of input strings. -  TupleHash256(X, L, S) -  TupleHashXOF128(X, L, S) -  TupleHashXOF256(X, L, S) -  ParallelHash128(X, B, L, S) rowspan=\\"4\\" A function designed to exploit parallelism in modern processors for faster hashing. Unlike KangarooTwelve, does not use reduced- round Keccak. -  ParallelHash256(X, B, L, S) -  ParallelHashXOF128(X, B, L, S) -  ParallelHashXOF256(X, B, L, S) } ‚Ä¢ X is the main input bit string. It may be of any length, including zero. ‚Ä¢ L is an integer representing the requested output length in bits. ‚Ä¢ N is a function-name bit string, used by NIST to define functions based on cSHAKE. When no function other than cSHAKE is desired, N is set to the empty string. ‚Ä¢ S is a customization bit string. The user selects this string to define a variant of the function. When no customization is desired, S is set to the empty string. ‚Ä¢ K is a key bit string of any length, including zero. ‚Ä¢ B is the block size in bytes for parallel hashing. It may be any integer such that 0 < B < 22040. ==Later developments Tree Hashing === In 2016 the same team that made the SHA-3 functions and the Keccak algorithm introduced faster reduced-rounds (reduced to 12 and 14 rounds, from the 24 in SHA-3) alternatives which can exploit the availability of parallel execution because of using tree hashing: KangarooTwelve and MarsupilamiFourteen. These functions differ from ParallelHash, the FIPS standardized Keccak-based parallelizable hash function, with regard to the parallelism, in that they are faster than ParallelHash for small message sizes. The reduced number of rounds is justified by the huge cryptanalytic effort focused on Keccak which did not produce practical attacks on anything close to twelve-round Keccak. These higher-speed algorithms are not part of SHA-3 (as they are a later development), and thus are not FIPS compliant; but because they use the same Keccak permutation they are secure for as long as there are no attacks on SHA-3 reduced to 12 rounds. KangarooTwelve is a higher-performance reduced-round (from 24 to 12 rounds) version of Keccak which claims to have 128 bits of security while having performance as high as 0.55 cycles per byte on a Skylake CPU. This algorithm is an IETF RFC draft. MarsupilamiFourteen, a slight variation on KangarooTwelve, uses 14 rounds of the Keccak permutation and claims 256 bits of security. Note that 256-bit security is not more useful in practice than 128-bit security, but may be required by some standards. 128 bits are already sufficient to defeat brute-force attacks on current hardware, so having 256-bit security does not add practical value, unless the user is worried about significant advancements in the speed of classical computers. For resistance against quantum computers, see below. KangarooTwelve and MarsupilamiFourteen are Extendable-Output Functions, similar to SHAKE, therefore they generate closely related output for a common message with different output length (the longer output is an extension of the shorter output). Such property is not exhibited by hash functions such as SHA-3 or ParallelHash (except of XOF variants). === The Farfalle Construction === In 2016, the Keccak team released a different construction called Farfalle construction, and Kravatte, an instance of Farfalle using the Keccak-p permutation., as well as two authenticated encryption algorithms Kravatte-SANE and Kravatte-SANSE == Security against quantum attacks == There is a general result (Grover's algorithm) that quantum computers can perform a structured preimage attack in \\\\sqrt{2^d} = 2^{d/2}, while a classical brute-force attack needs 2d. A structured preimage attack implies a second preimage attack and thus a collision attack. A quantum computer can also perform a birthday attack, thus break collision resistance, in \\\\sqrt[3]{2^d} = 2^{d/3} (although that is disputed). Noting that the maximum strength can be c/2, this gives the following upper bounds on the quantum security of SHA-3: {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Instance ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Security strengths in bits - ! Collision (Brassard et al.) !! Collision (Bernstein) !! Preimage !! 2nd preimage -  SHA3-224(M)  style=\\"background: yellow;\\"  74‚Öî  112  112  112 -  SHA3-256(M)  style=\\"background: yellow;\\"  85‚Öì  128  128  128 -  SHA3-384(M)  128  192  192  192 -  SHA3-512(M)  170‚Öî  256  256  256 -  SHAKE128(M, d)  min(d/3,128)  min(d/2,128)  ‚â•min(d/2,128)  min(d/2,128) -  SHAKE256(M, d)  min(d/3,256)min(d/2,256)‚â•min(d/2,256)min(d/2,256) } It has been shown that the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction, as used by SHA-2, is collapsing and, by consequence, quantum collision-resistant, but for the sponge construction used by SHA-3, the authors provide proofs only for the case that the block function f is not efficiently invertible; Keccak-f[1600], however, is efficiently invertible, and so their proof does not apply. ==Capacity change controversy== In February 2013 at the RSA Conference, and then in August 2013 at CHES, NIST announced they would select different values for the capacity, i.e. the security parameter, for the SHA-3 standard, compared to the submission. The changes caused some turmoil. The hash function competition called for hash functions at least as secure as the SHA-2 instances. It means that a d-bit output should have d/2-bit resistance to collision attacks and d-bit resistance to preimage attacks, the maximum achievable for d bits of output. Keccak's security proof allows an adjustable level of security based on a \\"capacity\\" c, providing c/2-bit resistance to both collision and preimage attacks. To meet the original competition rules, Keccak's authors proposed c=2d. The announced change was to accept the same d/2-bit security for all forms of attack and standardize c=d. This would have sped up Keccak by allowing an additional d bits of input to be hashed each iteration. However, the hash functions would not have been drop-in replacements with the same preimage resistance as SHA-2 anymore; it would have been cut in half, making it vulnerable to advances in quantum computing, which effectively would cut it in half once more. In September 2013, Daniel J. Bernstein suggested on the NIST hash-forum mailing list to strengthen the security to the 576-bit capacity that was originally proposed as the default Keccak, in addition to and not included in the SHA-3 specifications. This would have provided at least a SHA3-224 and SHA3-256 with the same preimage resistance as their SHA-2 predecessors, but SHA3-384 and SHA3-512 would have had significantly less preimage resistance than their SHA-2 predecessors. In late September, the Keccak team responded by stating that they had proposed 128-bit security by setting as an option already in their SHA-3 proposal. Although the reduced capacity was justifiable in their opinion, in the light of the negative response, they proposed raising the capacity to c = 512 bits for all instances. This would be as much as any previous standard up to the 256-bit security level, while providing reasonable efficiency, but not the 384-/512-bit preimage resistance offered by SHA2-384 and SHA2-512. The authors tried to justify that with the claim that \\"claiming or relying on security strength levels above 256 bits is meaningless\\". In early October 2013, Bruce Schneier criticized NIST's decision on the basis of its possible detrimental effects on the acceptance of the algorithm, saying: Paul Crowley, a cryptographer and senior developer at an independent software development company, expressed his support of the decision, saying that Keccak is supposed to be tunable and there is no reason for different security levels within one primitive. He also added: There was also some confusion that internal changes were made to Keccak. The Keccak team clarified this, stating that NIST's proposal for SHA-3 is a subset of the Keccak family, for which one can generate test vectors using their reference code submitted to the contest, and that this proposal was the result of a series of discussions between them and the NIST hash team. Also, Bruce Schneier corrected his earlier statement, saying: In response to the controversy, in November 2013 John Kelsey of NIST proposed to go back to the original proposal for all SHA-2 drop-in replacement instances. The reversion was confirmed in the April 2014 draft. This proposal was implemented in the final release standard in August 2015. The reduced- capacity forms were published as SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, where the number indicates the security level and the number of bits of output is variable, but should be twice as large as the required collision resistance. ==Examples of SHA-3 variants== The following hash values are from NIST.gov: SHA3-224(\\"\\") 6b4e03423667dbb73b6e15454f0eb1abd4597f9a1b078e3f5b5a6bc7 SHA3-256(\\"\\") a7ffc6f8bf1ed76651c14756a061d662f580ff4de43b49fa82d80a4b80f8434a SHA3-384(\\"\\") 0c63a75b845e4f7d01107d852e4c2485c51a50aaaa94fc61995e71bbee983a2ac3713831264adb47fb6bd1e058d5f004 SHA3-512(\\"\\") a69f73cca23a9ac5c8b567dc185a756e97c982164fe25859e0d1dcc1475c80a615b2123af1f5f94c11e3e9402c3ac558f500199d95b6d3e301758586281dcd26 SHAKE128(\\"\\", 256) 7f9c2ba4e88f827d616045507605853ed73b8093f6efbc88eb1a6eacfa66ef26 SHAKE256(\\"\\", 512) 46b9dd2b0ba88d13233b3feb743eeb243fcd52ea62b81b82b50c27646ed5762fd75dc4ddd8c0f200cb05019d67b592f6fc821c49479ab48640292eacb3b7c4be Changing a single bit causes each bit in the output to change with 50% probability, demonstrating an avalanche effect: SHAKE128(\\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\", 256) f4202e3c5852f9182a0430fd8144f0a74b95e7417ecae17db0f8cfeed0e3e66e SHAKE128(\\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dof\\", 256) 853f4538be0db9621a6cea659a06c1107b1f83f02b13d18297bd39d7411cf10c ==Comparison of SHA functions== In the table below, internal state means the number of bits that are carried over to the next block. Optimized implementation using AVX-512VL (i.e. from OpenSSL, running on Skylake-X CPUs) of SHA3-256 do achieve about 6.4 cycles per byte for large messages, and about 7.8 cycles per byte when using AVX2 on Skylake CPUs.. Performance on other x86, Power and ARM CPUs depending on instructions used, and exact CPU model varies from about 8 to 15 cycles per byte , with some older x86 CPUs up to 25‚Äì40 cycles per byte. == Implementations == Below is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-3: * Rust's sha3 * Botan * Bouncy Castle * Crypto++ * Libgcrypt * Nettle * OpenSSL * LibreSSL * wolfSSL * MIRACL Cryptographic SDK * Golang's x/crypto/sha3 == Hardware acceleration == Apple A13 ARMv8 six-core SoC CPU cores have support for accelerating SHA-3 (and SHA-512) using specialized instructions (EOR3, RAX1, XAR, BCAX) from ARMv8.2-SHA crypto extension set. Some software libraries use vectorization facilities of CPUs to accelerate usage of SHA-3. For example Crypto++ can use SSE2 on x86 for accelerating SHA3, and OpenSSL can use MMX, AVX-512 or AVX-512VL on many x86 systems too.. Also POWER8 CPUs implement 2x64-bit vector rotate, defined in PowerISA 2.07, which can accelerate SHA-3 implementations somehow. Most implementations for ARM doesn't use Neon vector instructions as it is slower than a scalar code, however it can be accelerated using SVE and SVE2 vector instructions (for example on Fujitsu A64FX CPU). == Usage in protocols == * ==See also== *Ethash ‚Äì another Keccak-based hash ==References * The Keccak web site Category:NIST hash function competition Category:Public-domain software with source code Category:Extendable-output functions ","title":"SHA-3"},{"id":"20394578","text":"Marcus Pomponius Maecius Probus (c. 195 ‚Äì after 228) was a Consul in 228.

He is also an attorney and five-term state legislator. While in the legislature, Faircloth was appointed to the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. In his final term, Faircloth was elected Majority Whip. Faircloth's first book published by Pitchstone Press, Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All - and What We Can Do About It was released in February 2012. His second book, The Enchanted Globe, a fantasy adventure story that teaches geography, was published in 2016. July 13, 2011 at The Amazing Meeting Faircloth had the idea for the Maine Discovery Museum in 1996 and led the project from concept to completion in 2001. It was credited with sparking downtown revitalization. Maine Discovery Museum was then the second largest children's museum outside Boston in New England. In 2016, Environment Maine recognized Faircloth with a gold medal in the \\"Mayor's Climate Olympics\\" for his residential rebate program, \\"EnergySmartBangor\\". Faircloth successfully spearheaded over thirty laws, including the so-called Deadbeat Dad child support law which was later incorporated into federal law. Faircloth had numerous legislative successes in children's issues and justice system reform.Bangor Daily News, June 3, 1996. Faircloth has spoken around the United States regarding the U.S. Constitution, children's policy, obesity policy, and sex crime law. In 2013 Faircloth traveled to New Zealand and Australia, lecturing at the Sydney Opera House to start policy oriented secular groups, whose model can be duplicated in other countries. In April 2014, Faircloth spoke in the Republic of Turkey about Atat√ºrk, the Erdogan government and Turkish secularism. On January 27, 2018, Faircloth launched his campaign to become the next governor of Maine.http://www.wmtw.com/article/former-bangor- mayor-launching-campaign-for-governor/15902208 On February 24, he dropped out of the campaign, citing his likely inability to receive public financing. He endorsed former House Speaker Mark Eves. Faircloth in Burbank, California (2009) ==Bangor, Maine== In 2016 Faircloth became mayor of Bangor, Maine. He proposed and led to creation EnergySmart Bangor for residents in July 2016 to help reduce energy costs as a residential rebate program. The organization Environment Maine selected Faircloth as the recipient of a Gold Medal in the \\"Climate Olympics,\\" for his outspoken advocacy for renewable energy sources. Environment Maine is a \\"nationwide program that recognizes leaders who promote clean and renewable energy options.\\" Mayor Faircloth initiated the Maine Multi-Cultural Center, securing the support of numerous businesses, in order to address the problem of loss of working-age population by welcoming New Americans. ==Maine Discovery Museum== In 1996 Faircloth had the idea for the Maine Discovery MuseumBoston Globe, March 11, 2001 and led that project through completion of the $4.5 million facility in 2001.Bangor Daily News Special Supplement January 18, 2001 Maine Discovery Museum served as a lynchpin of downtown revitalization.

At that time, the Maine Discovery Museum was the largest children's museum outside Boston in New England. Capital Campaign Director Martha Dudman stated, \\"Sean Faircloth's determination and attention to detail is what has made this project as successful as it has been.\\" ==Children's advocacy== Faircloth led the creation of Maine's Healthy Start child abuse prevention initiative,Bangor Daily News, February 4, 1995 and sponsored the first law making possession of child pornography a crime in Maine. \\"For his legislative accomplishments in the prevention of child sex abuse, and the healthy start child abuse prevention initiative,Lewiston Sun Journal August 8, 1993 and for spearheading the deadbeat dad child support law,\\" Faircloth was named Legislator of the Year by the Maine Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers in 1995, and by the Maine Psychological Association. The deadbeat dad law was incorporated into a proposal by the Clinton administration.Bangor Daily News, July 20, 1994 Laura Fortman, then Maine Women's Lobby Executive Director, said of this law, \\"Sean took the lead in proposing his revised amendment to members of the Appropriations Committee, in disagreement with some members of his own party on the Judiciary Committee, demonstrating tenacity and leadership. This legislation provided essential economic support for low-income women and children.\\" Maine's Chapter of the National Organization for Women said, \\"In his first term Sean Faircloth had a major impact on national public policy.\\" Faircloth received the Outstanding Advocacy Award from the Maine Association of Community Service Providers (MACSP) in 2003, in part because Faircloth twice successfully opposed cuts to children's mental health programs. MACSP President Jan Fraser said to Faircloth, \\"If there was ever the case that one person can make a huge difference, you are living proof.\\"Maine Association of Community Service Providers, September 10, 2003. Faircloth sponsored An Act To Enhance Education Services for Blind and Visually Impaired Children, which increased pay and the number of teachers for these children, as well as paid for new equipment for education for the blind.Bangor Daily News, April 4, 2007 In 2003 Faircloth initiated a first-in-the-nation policy improving school nutrition standards 24/7 in Maine K-12 schools,New York Times, November 9, 2003 preventing sale of soda from school vending machines, and leading to removing \\"super-sizing\\" from schools. For his work on child obesity policy, Faircloth was invited to speak at conferences at Harvard Medical School, Yale University, and the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Kelly Brownell, listed in Time Magazine's 100 most influential people said, \\"The legislative actions Rep. Faircloth has proposed are among the most innovative in the country. I fully expect legislators to follow Sean Faircloth's lead.\\" Because of these successes, Faircloth was named Legislator of the Year by the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003.Bangor Daily News, November 19, 2003 In 2004 Faircloth was appointed House Chair of a Sex Crime Commission to Improve Sex Offender Accountability, successfully enhancing penalties on fixated pedophiles while advocating moderation of sex crime registries.Kennebec Journal, February 19, 2004 In 2007 Faircloth was appointed House Chair of the Commission to Establish a Strategic Priorities Plan for Maine's Young Children,Lewiston Sun Journal September 7, 2007 which created a prioritized plan regarding children's policy,Brunswick Times Record August 8, 2008 and resulted in creation of the Maine Children's Growth Council. This Council, later designated Maine's Early Childhood Advisory Council, makes children's issues a top priority in law, emphasizing economic return on investment in early childhood. ==Writing and public speaking== Faircloth's first book is titled Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All - and What We Can Do About It. Faircloth said about the book, \\"we can believe rationally all we want. But we have to face up to reality: in the last thirty years we have seen the rise of theocracy in this country like we've never seen before. They've been tremendously successful on the religious right.\\" The book focuses on the importance of returning America to its secular roots. Faircloth's goal is to motivate secularists to become as active as the religious right saying, \\"let's do that. Let's get that done, and change society for the better\\" by focusing on the harmful changes brought about by the religious right. Faircloth is hoping the book will be a \\"wakeup call to many liberal religionists\\" and create an alliance between skeptics, non-theists and many religious liberals who should all care about the harm done by religious bias in the law. The book \\"doesn't just offer a call [to action], but a plan to address it.\\" In this review of the book, Adam Savage from MythBusters, writes: \\"There's not a doubt in my mind that if he was (suddenly, inexplicably) zapped back in time to meet Thomas Jefferson, that the Founding Father would clap him on the shoulder and say Thanks.\\" Susan Jacoby, Bill Nye and JREF's James Randi also give glowing reviews. Richard Dawkins writes that this book is important \\"particularly as we approach America's 2012 elections. The trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world.\\" In 2016, Faircloth published The Enchanted Globe which is a fantasy adventure story that teaches geography. The Maine Edge reviews the book and states that The Enchanted Globe is a \\"solid effort, telling an engaging story that will capture the imagination.\\" BDN Maine calls it a \\"fast- paced adventure story... the story starts in Maine, features highly recognizable Maine people, places and things, and carries with it an overall spirit of the state and its inhabitants.\\" Faircloth was a regular opinion columnist for the Bangor Metro Magazine from 2004 to 2009, and a columnist for the Bangor Daily News in the late 1990s. Because of his ideas about childhood obesity policy, Faircloth has spoken around the United States, including venues at Yale, Harvard,Boston Globe, June 12, 2003; Down East Magazine March 2004 Rice University, and the Centers for Disease Control. As Majority Whip, Faircloth was selected to welcome Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama in this warm-up speech when the Senator visited Maine in 2008. Faircloth states \\"We want a candidate who goes beyond parties...thinks independently and seeks justice.\\" In April 2014 Faircloth spoke at the Tree of Evolution's 'Science, Freethinking and Secularism' event in Istanbul in the Republic of Turkey. His lecture centered on Turkish secularism, Atat√ºrk and the Erdogan government. At the time YouTube was banned in Turkey which made it difficult for the speech to be shared beyond the audience. It was finally uploaded to DailyMotion in June and according to Good Morning Turkey it was \\"shared through social media thousands of times, named 'Turkey from an American's point of view'.\\" ==Justice system reform== Faircloth graduated from the University of Notre Dame and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Attorney Faircloth worked in private law practice, served as an Assistant Attorney General, as Legal Counsel to the Maine State Senate, and lobbied on behalf of the Maine State Bar Association. He also taught courses within the University of Maine system, including Criminal Law, Criminal Evidence, Judicial Process, Administrative Law, Legal Controversies, Advocacy, as well as Legal Writing and Research. Based on his experience as a lawyer and Assistant Attorney General, Faircloth worked successfully for improvements in child support and child protective laws.

Ackermann won and got the permission to work alone, he was the first independent sculptor in Estonia and acquired his own workshop at Toompea Hill. He probably died either in 1710 or a short time later from plague. Christian Ackermann was one of the greatest masters of the Baroque style in Estonia.

Thomsen. Gr√∏stl was chosen as one of the five finalists of the competition. It uses the same S-box as AES in a custom construction. The authors claim speeds of up to 21.4 cycles per byte on an Intel Core 2 Duo, and 9.6 cycles/byte on an Intel i7 with AES-NI. According to the submission document, the name \\"Gr√∏stl\\" is a multilingual play-on-words, referring to an Austrian dish that is very similar to hash (food). Like other hash functions in the MD5/SHA family, Gr√∏stl divides the input into blocks and iteratively computes hi = f(hi‚àí1, mi). However, Gr√∏stl maintains a hash state at least twice the size of the final output (512 or 1024 bits), which is only truncated at the end of hash computation. The compression function f is based on a pair of 256- or 512-bit permutation functions P and Q, and is defined as: : f(h, m) = P(h ‚äï m) ‚äï Q(m) ‚äï h The permutation functions P and Q are heavily based on the Rijndael (AES) block cipher, but operate on 8√ó8 or 8√ó16 arrays of bytes, rather than 4√ó4. Like AES, each round consists of four operations: # AddRoundKey (the Gr√∏stl round keys are fixed, but differ between P and Q) # SubBytes (this uses the Rijndael S-box, allowing sharing with AES implementations) # ShiftBytes (expanded compared to AES, this also differs between P and Q, and 512- and 1024-bit versions) # MixColumns (using an 8√ó8 matrix rather than Rijndael's 4√ó4) Unlike Rijndael, all rounds are identical and there is no final AddRoundKey operation. 10 rounds are recommended for the 512-bit permutation, and 14 rounds for the 1024-bit version. The final double-width hash receives a final output transformation of : Œ©(h) = h ‚äï P(h) and is then truncated to the desired width. This is equivalent to applying a final iteration of the compression function using an all-zero message block m, followed by a (cryptographically insignificant) exclusive-or with the fixed constant Q(0). ==Examples of Gr√∏stl hashes== Hash values of empty string.

He says that \\"The title, Death or Canada, was something that I discovered in archives in Limerick, Ireland, in a newspaper where the locals were writing about the choices that had to be made in 1847.

RT√â. Accessed 25 November 2008. Bishop Michael Power as portrayed in the film The episode investigates the impact of the Famine on North America. In summer 1847, Toronto, then a small city in the British colony of Canada, was swamped by an influx of 40,000 famine refugees from Ireland. Toronto's Bishop Michael Power, who following a visit to Ireland in 1847, endeavoured to warn the City Council of the human tsunami of Irish that were about to arrive on its shores. The programme follows the archaeological excavations recently undertaken by Toronto-based Archaeological Services Inc., on the site of the future headquarters of the Toronto International Film Festival, to find the remains of the so-called \\"fever sheds\\" in which emaciated immigrants were treated or died. The programme ends with the Willis family arriving at the Grosse √éle quarantine station outside of Quebec City at the narrowing of the Saint Lawrence River. The Willis' story is inter-cut with Robert Kearns, chairman of Toronto's Ireland Park, touring the island, which is now an Irish Memorial and National Historic Site. ===Episode two=== The second episode was broadcast on RT√â One on 2 December 2008 at 22:15.\\"Programme 2\\". RT√â. Accessed 25 November 2008. It follows the epic journey and tragic story of the Willis family who travel from the West of Ireland in the hopes of starting over in Canada. The program features interviews with William Clay Ford, Jr., whose ancestors came through Toronto in 1847 en route to Dearborn, Michigan, Professor Mark McGowan of the University of Toronto, Dr Peter Grey of Queen's University, Belfast, Microbiologist Dr. Donald Low of Toronto's Mt. Sinai Hospital and with Robert Kearns. Reflections on the famine are provided by John Waters. The Willis family continue their journey to Toronto, while the eastern ports and cities of British North America were overwhelmed by typhus-infested refugees who caused health crises wherever they went. The programme also looks at the heroes of the young city of Toronto as they absorb the famine refugees. Portrayed in the film are Dr. George Grassett, who was the Chief Medical Officer at Toronto's Fever Sheds, Toronto's Emigrant Agent, Edward McElderry, Nurse Susan Bailey, who also worked in the Fever Sheds and Bishop Michael Power who is the chief hero of Toronto's summer of sorrow in 1847 ‚Äì responsible for building the fever sheds and hospital that saved thousands of the refugees ‚Äì and finally dying himself from Typhus ‚Äì contracted from his time in the fever sheds. ==Production== Death or Canada is a Canada-Ireland Treaty Co-Production, produced by Canada's Ballinran Productions, and by Ireland's Tile Films. The interviews and dramatic recreations were filmed in Canada and Ireland. Irish locations included Achill Island and Cobh in April 2008. Production shifted to Canada in May 2008 where locations included Discovery Harbour, Black Creek Pioneer Village and St. Michael's Cathedral standing in for Toronto of 1847. Casting for the parts of the Willis Family ‚Äì John, Mary and their five children ‚Äì took place in Westport, County Mayo. The Canadian cast was pulled together from the Toronto area and all of the background actors are from the communities close to the filming locations. Toronto's Acme Pictures created the CGI scenes, which include the chaos at Limerick Docks in 1847, the arrival of the famine ships in Grosse √éle and the dozens of steamers and barges arriving with thousands of refugees at Toronto harbour. CGI scenes were also required for the fever sheds and the Toronto hospital where the sick and dying Irish were cared for that summer. Both episodes were edited and sound mixed in Toronto. The music for the film was composed by film and television composer Christopher Dedrick and also features a performance from the St. Michael's Choir School. ==Reception== Death or Canada was broadcast in Ireland on RT√â One in November/December 2008, in the UK on The History Channel UK in January and February 2009 as Fleeing The Famine, and in Canada on History Television on 16 March 2009.

McGowan told the Canadian Press that, for most Canadians, the Great Famine of Ireland is a period quite remote; for some, it is completely unknown and he hopes that \\"while this volume focuses on just one year, in one city, its intent is to encourage further social study of the Irish experience in Canada, while putting faces and voices to the bare statistics that have come to distinguish 'Black '47' from the other phases of Irish migration.\\" The book is published by the Canadian publishing company Novalis.

G√©za Alf√∂ldy notes that juridici for the districts of Italy did not come into existence until 166, and were praetorian offices held prior to the consulate. Because any son of Pudens the consul would be related to the imperial family, this relationship would excuse him from holding praetorian offices; the younger Quintus Servilius Pudens might then be the nephew of the consul of 166.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 264 n. 314 ==See also== * Servilia (gens) == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Pudens, Quintus Servilius ","title":"Quintus Servilius Pudens"},{"id":"20395123","text":"The Seeing Eye is a 1951 American short documentary film produced by Gordon Hollingshead in Technicolor about The Seeing Eye, a guide dog training school in Morristown, New Jersey.

It was completed in 1903. ==Background== It was designed by the famous British engineer Sir William Willcocks who also concurrently designed and built the Aswan Low Dam, the first Nile reservoir, about up-stream. The Assiut dam was constructed between 1898 and 1903, and in conjunction with the reservoir, provided for the diversion of river water into Egypt's largest irrigation canal, the Ibrahimiya Canal, during the low water season. The dam was estimated to cost ¬£525,000 but by the time of its completion it actually cost ¬£870,000. The main contractor for the project was the British contractor John Aird & Co..Egypt bond The project's massive size involved 2,400,000 cubic yards of earthwork, 125,000 cubic yards of concrete, 85,000 cubic yards of masonry, 125,000 cubic yards of pitching and more than 4,000 tons of cast iron pipes. The dam consists of a masonry dam about long extended on both sides by earthen banks, making a total length of about . There are 111 arched openings of span in the masonry dam. They can be closed by steel sluice-gates high. The piers and arches are founded upon a masonry platform wide by thick. This platform is protected on its up-stream and down-stream sides by a continuous and impermeable line of cast iron tongued and grooved sheet-piling with cemented joints. This piling extends into the sand bed of the river to a depth of below the upper surface of the platform and prevents it from being undermined. The river bed is protected against erosion for a width of upstream by a stone paving laid on a puddle clay blanket to check infiltration, and on the downstream side for the same width by a stone paving having an inverted filter bed underneath, so that any springs that may be caused by the water above the sluices shall not carry sand with them from beneath the paving. The piers between the openings have a length of up and down stream and are wide with the exception of every thirtieth pier, which has double this width. The roadway is above the top of the masonry platform. The dam has a maximum height of about , the maximum head of water retained being about . It is constructed of granite, the foundation platform mentioned above being of concrete. A lock long by wide and capable of passing the largest Nile cargo ships and barges was constructed at the dam.Edward Wegmann, (1918) The Design and Construction of Dams, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York The Ibrahimiya head regulator structure, which was built at the same time when the Assiut Barrage was being constructed, was of similar design to the barrage except having only nine 5 m wide sluices, and a 9 m wide lock. Ibrahimiya Canal Intake Regulator, also completed in 1902 ==Assiut Barrages Repairs and Upgrades== Between 1934 and 1938 the Egyptian Government carried out extensive remodeling works at the barrage and the Ibrahimiya head regulator, principally extending the piers, grouting, extending the approach slabs and updating the hydro-mechanical equipment. The dam was remodeled in 1938 to increase the permissible head to from the head that was allowed under its original design. In 1956 works were carried out at the Ibrahimiya head regulator as a result of significant scour holes that developed downstream of the structure. Extensions to downstream concrete apron were completed as well as lengthening of the southern lock wall. Some further grouting works and replacement of the lock gates took place in the 1970s. In 1979 a reinforced concrete pedestrian footbridge was constructed on the downstream side of the head regulator. Between 1984 and 1986 a program of cement grouting works was undertaken at the barrage, though there are no records of the head regulator receiving similar treatment. After more than 100 years in service, the civil works have been affected by age and also by tailwater erosion as a consequence of a modified river regime after the construction of the Aswan High Dam. ==The Planned New Dam== Along with the Aswan Low Dam, the Assiut Dam today remains in service as the oldest dam on the Nile in Upper Egypt. The two other old dams (Naga Hamadi and Isna Barrages) were replaced with new dams in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2005, the Egyptian government commissioned an extended Feasibility Study (FS) financed by the German government to investigate the options of rehabilitation of the existing Assiut Barrage and the Ibrahimiya head regulator against reconstruction of a new barrage with a hydro-power plant. German Consultants financed by the Kreditanstalt f√ºr Wiederaufbau (KfW) conducted the study and concluded that a new dam with power generating capabilities would be the most economic option. This new dam would provide an increase in the allowed head, allowing more water discharges into the Ibrahimiya Canal and will improve navigation conditions. The new dam will also include a low head hydropower plant providing about 40 Megawatts. The decision taken upon the results of the feasibility study was to proceed with the project of constructing a new barrage 200-300m downstream of the existing barrage. The proposed dam components are: #Sluiceway: 8 radial gates, 17m wide #Hydropower plant: 4 turbines x 8MW #Additional navigation lock: 120 x 17m chamber #Closure dam: embankment type, 11m high #Rehabilitation of the existing navigation lock; and #Rehabilitation of the existing Ibrahimiya head regulatorEgypt Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Invitation for the Pre-qualification Process for the Consulting Services for Final Design and Construction Supervision of the New Assiut Barrage and Hydropower Plant Project There is a concern that the new maximum pool level will increase the groundwater levels in Assiut city and in some areas in the upstream. Dealing with this situation, different layouts of the project have been studied in the feasibility study and some mitigation measures have been suggested. ==References== Category:Dams in Egypt Category:Dams on the Nile Category:Barrages (dam) Category:Dams completed in 1903 Category:Masonry dams Category:1903 establishments in Egypt ","title":"Assiut Barrage"},{"id":"20395274","text":"Guy of Ibelin (French: Guy d'Ibelin) (before 1306 - 1350/60) was seneschal of Cyprus from 1318 and a burgher of Venice from 30 December 1334..

He had family connections to Duncan McLaren a former Edinburgh Member of Parliament (MP) and to the famous Liberal John Bright.The Times, 24 January 1910 His maternal grandfather was James Duncan who was a member of The Society of Writers to the Signet the Edinburgh legal association. He was educated at the University of Edinburghwhere he obtained an MA degree and a Bachelor of Laws(LLB). In 1906 he married Ella Forester- Paton of Alloa. They had one daughter and one son.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Their son, Ian Alistair Duncan Millar, a Perthshire farmer, stood as Liberal candidate in the Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election in 1963 at which Alec Douglas-Home was returned to the House of Commons, coming second to Home.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/by_elections/63.html%23kinross&date;=2009-10-25+19:14:25 ==Law career== James Duncan Millar was one of the few men to become a member of both the Scottish and English Bars. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh in 1896 and in the following year was called to the English Bar at the Middle Temple. He obtained a large practice in Scotland and was Senior Advocate Depute from 1913‚Äì1916. He was made a King's Counsel in Scotland in January 1914. ==Politics== Millar was elected Liberal MP for St Andrews Burghs at the general election of January 1910 when he defeated the sitting Conservative, William Anstruther-Gray. However he lost the seat back to Anstruther-Gray at the December 1910 general election. In 1911, an opportunity arose for Millar with the resignation from Parliament of the Liberal MP for North East Lanarkshire, Thomas Fleming Wilson and Millar was re-elected to the House of Commons at a by-election held on 9 March 1911. He held North East Lanarkshire until 1918, when the seat was abolished. He moved to contest Motherwell at the 1918 General Election as the Liberal party candidate, but finished second to the Unionist in a three-way contest. Millar did not find another seat until the 1922 general election when he was successful at East Fife, gaining the seat from the Tories. This must have been a particularly sweet victory as the MP he defeated had taken the constituency from former Liberal leader H H Asquith in 1918, a seat Asquith had held since 1886. Millar was able to hold the seat at the 1923 general election but lost in 1924 to the Conservative Archibald Cochrane. He won the seat back from Cochrane at the 1929 general election albeit by the narrow margin of 581 votes The Times, 30 October 1961 ==National Liberal== In 1931, an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the policy of Free Trade. The official party led by Sir Herbert Samuel although agreeing to go into the 1931 general election supporting MacDonald became increasingly alarmed about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross- party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald's administration. Millar was not one of the founding members of the Liberal National Party but his endorsement of the government's programme was enough to ensure the Conservatives did not put up a candidate against him in East Fife in 1931 and on 16 October 1931, Millar found himself returned unopposed to represent East Fife in the next Parliament.The Times, 17 October 1931 He then chose to support the administration loyally and continued to describe himself as a Liberal National when the Samuelite Liberals withdrew from the coalition. He continued to enjoy the support of both the local Liberal and Conservative Associations in East Fife, with both of which organisations he had gained the reputation for being a good constituency MP, particularly in representing the interests of fishing and agriculture.The Times, 12 December 1932 Millar died in office at the age of 61. At the by- election held on 2 February 1933 to fill the East Fife seat following Millar's death, the local Liberal Association selected the Simonite James Henderson- Stewart to fight the seat.David Dutton, Liberal Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party; I B Tauris, 2008 p69 Standing as a Liberal National, Henderson-Stewart easily held the seat with a majority of 9,135 votes. He did not face Conservative opposition but there were four other candidates, including Labour, Agricultural Party, Independent Liberal and National Party of Scotland. ==Honours== In 1913, Millar was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to sit on a committee of experts to look into the spread of various diseases in Africa and how they could be controlled.The Times, 30 July 1913 Millar was knighted in the 1932 New Year Honours for political and public services.The Times, 1 January 1932 ==Death== Millar died at his home, Remony Lodge, Aberfeldy in Perthshire, following a period of some weeks suffering badly with phlebitis and complications.The Times, 10 October 1932 & 12 December 1932 ==References External links == * Category:1871 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Members of the Faculty of Advocates Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Scottish Queen's Counsel Category:Queen's Counsel 1901‚Äì2000 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Scottish Liberal Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1910 Category:UK MPs 1910‚Äì1918 Category:UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 Category:UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 Category:UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 Category:UK MPs 1931‚Äì1935 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Fife constituencies Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) politicians ","title":"James Duncan Millar"},{"id":"20395391","text":"Children‚Äôs Rehabilitation Center in White Plains, NY The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower The St. Vincent Heart Center of Indiana Healthcare real estate is a niche market within the larger real estate industry. Healthcare real estate or \\"medical real estate\\" describes buildings, offices, and campuses leased to members or organizations within the healthcare community. These buildings can be owned by hospitals, health systems or private or public third party groups. There is a rising trend among hospitals, health care systems, and medical practitioners to embrace third party ownership and management of real estate. By using third party developers, they can preserve their capital resources for acute care needs and focus their attention on helping people, while passing on responsibility of building regulation and maintenance minutiae. ==Differentiation== Healthcare facilities have detailed technological and regulatory requirements. Even such building maintenance tasks as cleaning, heating, and cooling are done differently in health care, with demanding sterilization and filtration needs. In addition to outsourcing building and management tasks, it's becoming increasingly attractive for hospitals to leave building ownership itself to someone else. The concept fits well with the current US development trend pairing not-for-profit hospitals with for-profit physician groups as partners in new specialty facilities. Illinois, Texas, California, and Florida accounted for a third of healthcare construction starts in 2007, though the practice of third party ownership is also rising among all metropolitan areas where space is at a premium. From an investor viewpoint, healthcare REITs as a group generally trade at a premium yield to other REIT categories. It is also considered one of the more stable sectors, along with higher education and government.

US Census projects there will be 86.7 million people 65 and older by 2050, comprising 21% of the total population. *Advances in technology that allow increasing numbers of medical procedures to be done in offices outside of a hospital setting *Tight medical office markets in many areas as little new construction came on line for several years *Rapid population growth in some areas that has outstripped the supply of medical offices *Increasing interest from investors looking to take advantage of high lease rates and a generally stable physician tenant base.

She was the most important soprano of her age.Queens of Song, Ellen Creathorn Clayton, 94-109 A woman of great personal charm and dynamism, Charles Burney referred to her as \\"the most intelligent and best-bred virtuosa\\" that he had ever encountered. The excellence of her vocal artistry is reflected in the fact that she was able to secure long-term engagements in three of the most prestigious operatic centers in her day outside of Italy (Vienna, St. Petersburg, and London). ==Biography== Caterina Gabrielli was the daughter of a cook in the service of prince Gabrielli, in Rome. With the support of the prince, she studied with Garc√≠a and Porpora and at the L'Ospedaletto conservatory in Venice, and as a sign of gratitude she decided to assume her patron's surname as her stage name. Her humble roots were remembered by audiences in her nickname La cochetta (\\"little cook\\"), which was actually recorded in the librettos published for her early appearances at the Teatro San Mois√® in Venice during the 1754‚Äì55 operatic season. In 1747 she sang at the theater of Lucca in Sofonisba by Baldassare Galuppi and in 1750 she appeared in Niccol√≤ Jommelli's Didone. Her first distinguished season of singing was in Venice in 1754‚Äì55. She was then hired by the imperial court of Vienna and sang in a series of dramatic works of various types written by Christoph Willibald von Gluck: La danza (1755), Le cinesi (1755), L'innocenza giustificata (1755), and Il re pastore (1756). She also appeared in two sacred works of Georg Christoph Wagenseil: Gioas re ti Giuda (1755) and Il roveto di Mos√® (1756). She flourished in Italy for the remainder of the 1750s, notably appearing in the world premieres of Pasquale Errichelli's Siroe (1758, Emira) and Gaetano Latilla's Ezio (1758, Fulvia). In 1760 Gabrielli returned to Vienna to appears in Gluck's Tetide, Giuseppe Scarlatti's Issipile, and Johann Adolf Hasse's Alciade al Bivio. A second return to Italy brought even greater prestige. In 1767, she created the role of Argene in Josef Mysliveƒçek's opera Il Bellerofonte at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, thereby helping the composer break through to the upper echelon of operatic masters in Italy. In the period 1772‚Äì75, she was employed at the imperial court of St. Petersburg with Francesca Gabrielli. She appeared in Tommaso Traetta's operas Antigona (1772), Amore e Psiche (1773) and Lucio Vero (1774). She also sang several aria concerts with orchestral accompaniment at the court. In 1775 she moved to London because the director of imperial theaters in St. Petersburg was unwilling to pay what her future employers in London had promised. During her last period of activity in Italy, in the title role of Mysliveƒçek's Armida, performed in Milan during carnival of 1780 as one of the earliest operas produced at La Scala, she was forced to interrupt her performances in order to give birth to a baby daughter, the identity of whose father remains unknown. She also suffered the indignities of having to substitute arias by Giuseppe Sarti for the ones provided for her by Mysliveƒçek and being taunted for her age by the Milanese audience. Although Gabrielli and Mysliveƒçek were close artistic collaborators at times, there is no documentation to support reports that they were romantically involved; the earliest mention of a love affair with Mysliveƒçek is found in the fifth edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1954).This finding is documented in Daniel E. Freeman, Josef Mysliveƒçek, \\"Il Boemo\\" (Sterling Heights, Mich.: Harmonie Park Press, 2009). She was actually closer to the composer Traetta, who was probably responsible for having her brought to St. Petersburg. After her last known operatic appearances in Venice in 1782, she retired to Bologna, where she died in 1796. The singer Francesca Gabrielli (born ca. 1735) was probably her sister. She frequently traveled with Caterina and sometimes appeared in lesser roles in the same operas that featured her as prima donna. ==Operatic roles== *Sofonisba by Baldassare Galuppi (Lucca, 1747) *Didone by Niccol√≤ Jommelli (Naples, 1750) *Ermione in Antigona by Baldassare Galuppi (Venice, 1754) *Ermione in Astianatte by Antonio Gaetano Pampani (Venice, 1755) *Emira in Solimano by Domenico Fischietti (Venice, 1755) *Lisinga in L‚Äôeroe cinese by Gaetano Piazza (Milan, 1758) *Ipermestra in Ipermestra by Baldassare Galuppi (Milan, 1758) *Fulvia in Ezio by Gaetano Latilla (Naples, 1758) *Beroe in the pasticcio Nitteti (Genoa, 1758) *Dircea in Demofoonte by Baldassare Galuppi (Padua, 1758) *Cleofide in an anonymous Alessandro nell‚ÄôIndie (Milan, 1759) *Dircea in Demofoonte by Antonio Ferradini (Milan, 1759) *Aricia in Ippolito ed Aricia by Tommaso Traetta (Parma, 1759) *Vitellia in La clemenza di Tito by Baldassare Galuppi (Turin, 1760) *Lavinia in Enea nel Lazio by Tommaso Traetta (Turin, 1760) *Telaire in I tindaridi by Tommaso Traetta (Parma, 1760) *Cleonice in an anonymous Demetrio (Padua, 1761) *Zenobia in an anonymous Zenobia (Lucca, 1761) *Cleonice in Demetrio by Giuseppe Ponzo (Turin, 1762) *Ifigenia in Ifigenia in Aulide by Ferdinando Bertoni (Turin, 1762) *Cleofide in Alessandro nell‚ÄôIndie by Tommaso Traetta (Reggio Emilia, 1762) *Fulvia in Ezio by Giuseppe Scarlatti (Lucca, 1762) *Emirena in Adriano in Siria by Giuseppe Colla (Milan, 1763) *Didone in Didone abbandonata by Tommaso Traetta (Milan, 1763) *Aristea in L‚Äôolimpiade by Pietro Guglielmi (Naples, 1763) *Issipile in the pasticcio Issipile (Naples, 1763) *Berenice in Lucio Vero by Antonio Sacchini (Naples, 1764) *Marzia in Catone in Utica by Johann Christian Bach (Naples, 1764) *Marzia in Cajo Mario by Niccol√≤ Piccinni (Naples, 1765) *Climene in Il grand Cid by Niccol√≤ Piccinni (Naples, 1766) *Berenice in Lucio Vero by Antonio Sacchini (Naples, 1766) *Argene in Il Bellerofonte by Josef Mysliveƒçek (Naples, 1767) *Clelia in Il trionfo di Clelia by Josef Mysliveƒçek (Turin, 1768) *Ariene in Creso by Pasquale Cafaro (Turin, 1768) *Dircea in Demofoonte by Baldassare Galuppi (Palermo, 1768) *Berenice in the pasticcio Antigono (Palermo, 1769) *Aristea in the anonymous L‚Äôolimpiade (Palermo, 1770) *Cleonice in the pasticcio Demetrio (Palermo, 1770) *Antigona in Antigona by Tommaso Traetta (St. Petersburg, 1772) *Psiche in Amore e Psiche by Tommaso Traetta (St. Petersburg, 1773) *Berenice in Lucio Vero by Tommaso Traetta (St. Petersburg, 1774) *Armida in the anonymous Armida (Lucca, 1778) *Armida in Armida by Josef Mysliveƒçek (Milan, 1780) *Beroe in La Nitteti by Pasquale Anfossi (Venice, 1780) *Semiri in Arbace by Giovanni Battista Borghi (Venice, 1782) *Semira in Zemira by Pasquale Anfossi (Venice, 1782) Source: Claudio Sartori.

SWAT is a public domain software enabled model actively supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service at the Blackland Research & Extension Center in Temple, Texas, USA. It is a hydrology model with the following components: weather, surface runoff, return flow, percolation, evapotranspiration, transmission losses, pond and reservoir storage, crop growth and irrigation, groundwater flow, reach routing, nutrient and pesticide loading, and water transfer. SWAT can be considered a watershed hydrological transport model. This model is used worldwide and is continuously under development. As of July 2012, more than 1000 peer-reviewed articles have been published that document its various applications. ==Model operation== SWAT is a continuous time model that operates on a daily time step at basin scale. The objective of such a model is to predict the long-term impacts in large basins of management and also timing of agricultural practices within a year (i.e., crop rotations, planting and harvest dates, irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticide application rates and timing). It can be used to simulate at the basin scale water and nutrients cycle in landscapes whose dominant land use is agriculture. It can also help in assessing the environmental efficiency of best management practices and alternative management policies. SWAT uses a two-level dissagregation scheme; a preliminary subbasin identification is carried out based on topographic criteria, followed by further discretization using land use and soil type considerations. Areas with the same soil type and land use form a Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU), a basic computational unit assumed to be homogeneous in hydrologic response to land cover change. ==See also== *Storm Water Management Model *Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model *Swat-CUP *ALMANAC (software model) == References == * ==External links== * Category:Hydrology models Category:Hydraulic engineering Category:Environmental engineering Category:Public-domain software ","title":"SWAT model"},{"id":"20395564","text":"The Living City is a 1953 American short documentary film about Chicago, by Haskell Wexler and John Barnes.

In a ruling of January 13, 2010, Kyiv's Court of Appeal recognized the leaders of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime as those guilty of 'genocide against the Ukrainian national group in 1932-33 through the artificial creation of living conditions intended for its partial physical destruction.'\\" The court dropped criminal proceedings against the leaders: Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, Pavel Postyshev, Vlas Chubar and others, who all had died years before. This decision became effective on 21 January 2010. === Russian Federation === The Russian Federation officially says that the Holodomor is not an ethnic genocide. The lower house of parliament passed a resolution in 2008 stating that the Holodomor should not be considered genocide: > There is no historical proof that the famine was organized along ethnic > lines. Its victims were millions of citizens of the Soviet Union, > representing different peoples and nationalities living largely in > agricultural areas of the country. The Russian Federation condemned the Soviet regime's \\"disregard for the lives of people in the attainment of economic and political goals\\", along with \\"any attempts to revive totalitarian regimes that disregard the rights and lives of citizens in former Soviet states\\" yet stated that \\"there is no historic evidence that the famine was organized on ethnic grounds.\\" Russian politician Mikhail Kamynin has claimed that Russia is against the politicisation of the Holodomor, and this question is for historians, not politicians.News Ru Russia owes Ukraine no apologies\\" thinks vice-speaker of the Duma Released on 5th of December, 2006. Simultaneously the vice-speaker of the Russian State Duma, Lyubov Sliska, when asked in Kiev when Russia would apologize for its part in repressions and famines in Ukraine, replied, \\"why always insist that Russia apologize for everything? The people whose policies brought suffering not only to Ukraine, but to Russia, Belarus, peoples of the Caucasus, and Crimean Tatars, remain only in history textbooks, secret documents and minutes of meetings.\\" Ukrainian mass media censured Evgeny Guzeev, the Consul-General of the Russian Federation in Lviv, who stated that \\"the leaders of the period were sensible people, and it is impossible to imagine that this was planned.\\"Borysov, Dmytro \\"Russian diplomat denies the Holodomor\\" Lvivska Hazeta 29.11.2005 Kyiv Post believes that Russia contests the recognition of the famine as a genocide is because \\"as the Soviet Union's legal successor, Russia is also concerned about the possibility of legal action or having to pay reparations.\\" On November 17, 2007 members from Aleksandr Dugin's Russian nationalist group the Eurasian Youth Union broke into the Ukrainian cultural center in Moscow and smashed an exhibition on the famine. According to a Moscow Times article: \\"The Kremlin argues that genocide is the killing of a population based on their ethnicity, whereas Stalin's regime annihilated all kinds of people indiscriminately, regardless of their ethnicity. But if the Kremlin really believed in this argument, it would officially acknowledge that Stalin's actions constituted mass genocide against all the people of the Soviet Union.\\" In November 2010 a leaked confidential U.S. diplomatic cable revealed that Russia had allegedly pressured its neighbors not to support the designation of Holodomor as a genocide at the United Nations. == International recognition  United Nations === The final report of the \\"International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932‚Äì33 Famine in Ukraine\\", delivered to the UN Under-Secretary for Human Rights in Geneva on May 9, 1990, concluded that the famine in Ukraine was, in fact, genocide. At same time the commission majority (5 of 6) deems it plausible that the constituent elements of genocide were in existence at the time of the famine.Final Report of International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932‚Äì33 Famine in Ukraine p.9 https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor- Commission.pdf Commission is unable to affirm the existence of a preconceived plan to organize a famine in Ukraine, in order to ensure the success of Moscow policies.Final Report of International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932‚Äì33 Famine in Ukraine p.48 https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor- Commission.pdf On 10 November 2003, 23 countries affirmed the Joint declaration at the United Nations in connection with 70th anniversary of the Great Famine in Ukraine 1932‚Äì1933, which had the following preamble:Joint Statement on Holodomor evaluating the Holodomor as a great tragedy. > In the former Soviet Union millions of men, women and children fell victims > to the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime. The Great > Famine of 1932‚Äì1933 in Ukraine (Holodomor), took from 7 million to 10 > million innocent lives and became a national tragedy for the Ukrainian > people. In this regard, we note activities in observance of the seventieth > anniversary of this Famine, in particular organized by the Government of > Ukraine. Honouring the seventieth anniversary of the Ukrainian tragedy, we > also commemorate the memory of millions of Russians, Kazakhs and > representatives of other nationalities who died of starvation in the Volga > River region, Northern Caucasus, Kazakhstan and in other parts of the former > Soviet Union, as a result of civil war and forced collectivisation, leaving > deep scars in the consciousness of future generations. Valery Kuchinsky, the chief Ukrainian representative, stated that the declaration was a compromise between the position of Ukraine that the Holodomor was a genocide and the positions of Great Britain, United States and Russia that it was not. === United States === At the conference on \\"Recognition and Denial of Genocide and Mass Killing in the 20th Century,\\" held at City University of New York on 13 November 1987, it was stated that Soviet Ukraine suffered a man-made famine in 1932‚Äì1933, during which millions died. The United States Government Commission concluded this was part of the central governments's attack on Ukrainian nationality and culture. The United States Government received numerous contemporary intelligence reports on the famine from its European embassies, but chose not to acknowledge the famine publicly. Similarly, leading members of the American press corps in the Soviet Union willfully covered up the famine in their dispatches. In both cases, political considerations relating to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. seem to have been critical factors in this cover-up. According to the US Government Commission on the Ukrainian Famine, the seizure of the 1932 crop by the Soviet authorities was the main reason for the famine. The US commission stated that \\"while famine took place during the 1932‚Äì1933 agricultural year in the Volga Basin and the North Caucasus Territory as a whole, the invasiveness of Stalin's interventions of both the Fall of 1932 and January 1933 in Ukraine are paralleled only in the ethnically Ukrainian Kuban region of the North Caucasus\\". === Europe === On 3 July 2008 the Parliamentary Assembly of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe passed the resolution condemning the Ukrainian famine acknowledging the direct responsibility of the Soviet action. The resolution called upon all parliaments to take measures on recognition of the fact of Holodomor in Ukraine but fell short of recognizing it as an act of genocide as requested by the document prepared by the Ukrainian delegation.–ü–ê –û–ë–°–ï –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∞ —Ä–µ–∑–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—é –ø–æ –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä—É –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ. –ì–µ–Ω–æ—Ü–∏–¥–æ–º –æ–Ω –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–Ω, Newsru.com, 3 July 2008 –≥.–ü–ê –û–ë–°–ï –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∞ —Ä–µ–∑–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—é –ø–æ –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä—É –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ, korrespondent.net, 3 July 2008 On 23 October 2008, the European Parliament passed a resolution that called Holodomor \\"an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people, and against humanity\\" that was \\"cynically and cruelly planned by Stalin's regime in order to force through the Soviet Union's policy of collectivization of agriculture\\". The resolution, however, stopped short of calling the famine an act of genocide. == Misuse of graphical materials == Some images related to the Russian and Ukrainian famine of 1921 or Great Depression in the United States have been presented as Holodomor-related images.–£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–∞ –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω—è–µ—Ç –≤ –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä–µ –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—é –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –°–®–ê –†—É–∑–≤–µ–ª—å—Ç–∞ Regnum 6 March 2009 According to American historian, Morgan E Williams: \\"Ninety-five percent of the photos that are represented as being of the Ukrainian famine are from Russia.

There are 13 monarchies in the Americas (self-governing states and territories that have a monarch as head of state). Each is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office, usually keeping it until death or abdication, and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers. Ten of these monarchies are independent states; they equally share Queen Elizabeth II, who resides primarily in the United Kingdom, as their respective sovereign, making them part of a global group known as the Commonwealth realms. The others are dependencies of three European monarchies. As such, none of the monarchies in the Americas have a permanently residing monarch. These crowns continue a history of monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others did the same with a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century. From that date on, through the Age of Discovery, European colonization brought extensive American territory under the control of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the American Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence, usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as Canada's patriation of its constitution from the United Kingdom. A certain number of former colonies became republics immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with endemic constitutional monarchies‚Äîin the cases of Haiti, Mexico, and Brazil‚Äîwith their own pp ==Current monarchiesAmerican monarchies=== While the incumbent of each of the American monarchies is the same person and resides predominantly in Europe, each of the states are sovereign and thus have distinct local monarchies seated in their respective capitals, with the monarch's day-to-day governmental and ceremonial duties generally carried out by an appointed local viceroy. Antigua and Barbuda The monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 1 November 1981, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda, Sir Rodney Williams. Elizabeth and her royal consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, included Antigua and Barbuda in their 1966 Caribbean tour, and again in the Queen's Silver Jubilee tour of October 1977. Elizabeth returned once more in 1985. For the country's 25th anniversary of independence, on 30 October 2006, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, opened Antigua and Barbuda's new parliament building, reading a message from his mother, the Queen. The Duke of York visited Antigua and Barbuda in January 2001. The Bahamas The monarchy of The Bahamas has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony, after 1717. On 10 July 1973, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of The Bahamas. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of the Bahamas, Sir Cornelius A. Smith. Barbados The monarchy of Barbados has its roots in the English monarchy, under the authority of which the island was claimed in 1625 and first colonized in 1627, and later the British monarchy. By the 18th century, Barbados became one of the main seats of the British Crown's authority in the British West Indies, and then, after an attempt in 1958 at a federation with other West Indian colonies, continued as a self- governing colony until, on 30 November 1966, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Barbados. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Barbados, Sir Elliott Belgrave. In 1966, Elizabeth's cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, opened the second session of the first parliament of the newly established country, before the Queen herself, along with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, toured Barbados. Elizabeth returned for her Silver Jubilee in 1977, and again in 1989, to mark the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Barbadian parliament. Former Prime Minister Owen Arthur called for a referendum on Barbados becoming a republic to be held in 2005, though the vote was then pushed back to \\"at least 2006\\" in order to speed up Barbados' integration in the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. It was announced on 26 November 2007 that the referendum would be held in 2008, together with the general election that year. The vote was, however, postponed again to a later point, due to administrative concerns. Belize Belize was, until the 15th century, a part of the Mayan Empire, containing smaller states headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ajaw (later k‚Äôuhul ajaw). The present monarchy of Belize has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the area was first colonised in the 16th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 21 September 1981, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Belize. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Belize, Sir Colville Young. Canada Painting of the Four Mohawk Kings, done during their visit with Queen Anne in 1710 Canada's aboriginal peoples had systems of governance organised in a fashion similar to the Occidental concept of monarchy; European explorers often referred to hereditary leaders of tribes as kings. The present monarchy of Canada has its roots in the French and English monarchies, under the authority of which the area was colonised in the 16th-18th centuries, and later the British monarchy. The country became a self-governing confederation on 1 July 1867, recognised as a kingdom in its own right, but did not have full legislative autonomy from the British Crown until the passage of the Statute of Westminster on 11 December 1931, retaining the then reigning monarch, George V, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Canada. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor General of Canada, Julie Payette, and in each of the provinces by a lieutenant governor. Grenada The monarchy of Grenada has its roots in the French monarchy, under the authority of which the islands were first colonised in the mid 17th century, and later the English and then British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 7 February 1974, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Grenada. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Grenada, currently Dame C√©cile La Grenade. Jamaica Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (far left), heir to the Jamaican throne, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (centre), at the Half Moon Hotel, Montego Bay, 13 March 2008 The monarchy of Jamaica has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the islands were first colonised in the late 16th century, and later the English and then British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 6 August 1962, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Jamaica. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Jamaica, Sir Patrick Allen. Former Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson- Miller has expressed an intention to oversee the process required to change Jamaica to a republic by 2012; she originally stated this would be complete by August of that year. In 2003, former Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, advocated making Jamaica into a republic by 2007. Saint Kitts and Nevis The monarchy of Saint Kitts and Nevis has its roots in the English and French monarchies, under the authority of which the islands were first colonised in the early 17th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 10 June 1973, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis, currently Sir Tapley Seaton. Saint Lucia The Caribs who occupied the island of Saint Lucia in pre-Columbian times had a complex society, with hereditary kings and shamans. The present monarchy has its roots in the Dutch, French, and English monarchies, under the authority of which the island was first colonised in 1605, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 22 February 1979, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Saint Lucia. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Saint Lucia, currently Dame Pearlette Louisy. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines The present monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has its roots in the French monarchy, under the authority of which the island was first colonised in 1719, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 27 October 1979, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Vincent and the Grenadines, currently Sir Frederick Ballantyne. ===Settled monarchies=== Denmark H√°kon, King of Norway (seated on the left) took possession of Greenland in 1261. Greenland is one of the three constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark, with Queen Margrethe II as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the King of Norway; by 1380, Norway had entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark, which became more entrenched with the union of the kingdoms into Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1536. After the dissolution of this arrangement in 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after its role in World War II, was granted its special status within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner), Mikaela Engell. Netherlands Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten are constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, as do the islands of the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained under the control of the Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved in 2010; two of its islands became constituent countries in their own right (Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten), while the other three became integral parts of the Netherlands (i.e., the Caribbean Netherlands). The monarch is represented in the constituent countries by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Cura√ßao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday. United Kingdom The United Kingdom possesses a number of overseas territories in the Americas, for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch. In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout the first half of the 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Tim Foy; the Governor of Bermuda, John Rankin; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, Gus Jaspert; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Helen Kilpatrick; the Governor of Montserrat, Andrew Pearce; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, John Freeman. The Falkland Islands, off the south coast of Argentina, were simultaneously claimed for Louis XV of France, in 1764, and George III of the United Kingdom, in 1765, though the French colony was ceded to Charles III of Spain in 1767. By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were governed by the British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985. The monarch is represented in these regions by Nigel Phillips, who is both the Governor of the Falkland Islands and the Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. ==Succession laws== Before 28 October 2011, the succession order in the American Commonwealth realms, as well as those British overseas territories in the Americas, adhered to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, by which succession passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and subsequently to daughters, again in order of birth. However, with the possible exception of Canada, following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement, succession is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender. As these states share the person of their monarch with other countries, all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.Females get the nod in Denmark (In Danish) ==Former monarchies== The monument to Cuauht√©moc, the last sovereign king of the Aztec Empire Most pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas developed and flourished for centuries under monarchical systems of government. By the time Europeans arrived on the continents in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, however, many of these civilizations had ceased to function, due to various natural and artificial causes. Those that remained up to that period were eventually defeated by the agents of European monarchical powers, who, while they remained on the European continent, thereafter established new American administrations overseen by delegated viceroys. Some of these colonies were, in turn, replaced by either republican states or locally founded monarchies, ultimately overtaking the entire American holdings of some European monarchs; those crowns that once held or claim territory in the Americas include the Spanish, Portuguese, French, Swedish, and Russian, and even Baltic Courland, Holy Roman, Prussian and Norwegian. Certain of the locally established monarchies were themselves also overthrown through revolution, leaving five current pretenders to American thrones. ===Endemic monarchies=== Araucania and Patagonia Or√©lie-Antoine I of Araucania and Patagonia The Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia was a short-lived attempt at establishing a constitutional monarchy, founded by French lawyer and adventurer Orelie- Antoine de Tounens in 1860. Nominally, the \\"kingdom\\" encompassed the present- day Argentine part of Patagonia and a small segment of Chile, where Mapuche peoples were fighting to maintain their sovereignty against the advancing Chilean and Argentine armed forces. However, Or√©lie-Antoine never exercised sovereignty over the claimed territory, and his de facto control was limited to nearly fourteen months and to a small territory around a town called Perquenco (at the time mainly a Mapuche tent village), which was also the declared capital of his kingdom. Or√©lie-Antoine felt that the indigenous peoples would be better served in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected by a group of Mapuche loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Or√©lie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucan√≠a, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Or√©lie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. A recent pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lived in France until 2017. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy. Aztec The Aztec Empire existed in the central Mexican region between c. 1325 and 1521, and was formed by the triple alliance of the tlatoque (the Nahuatl term for \\"speaker\\", also translated in English as \\"king\\") of three city-states: Tlacopan, Texcoco, and the capital of the empire, Tenochtitlan. While the lineage of Tenochtitlan's kings continued after the city's fall to the Spanish on 13 August 1521, they reigned as puppet rulers of the King of Spain until the death of the last dynastic tlatoani, Luis de Santa Mar√≠a Nanacacipactzin, on 27 December 1565. Brazil Maria I of Portugal became the first Queen of Brazil in 1815 with the creation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Emperor Pedro II of Brazil Brazil was created as a kingdom on 16 December 1815, when Prince Jo√£o, Prince of Brazil, who was then acting as regent for his ailing mother, Queen Maria, elevated the colony to a constituent country of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. While the royal court was still based in Rio de Janeiro, Jo√£o ascended as king of the united kingdom the following year, and returned to Portugal in 1821, leaving his son, Prince Pedro, Prince Royal, as his regent in the Kingdom of Brazil. In September of that same year, the Portuguese parliament threatened to diminish Brazil back to the status of a colony, dismantle all the royal agencies in Rio de Janeiro, and demanded Pedro return to Lisbon. The Prince, however, feared these moves would trigger separatist movements and refused to comply; instead, at the urging of his father, he declared Brazil an independent Nation on 7 September 1822, leading to the formation of the Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. Prince Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822, with the title of Pedro I (on that date, he was formally offered the Throne of the newly created Empire, accepted it, and was acclaimed as monarch), and his coronation took place on 1 December 1822. After Pedro abdicated the throne on 7 April 1831, the Brazilian empire saw only one additional monarch: Pedro II, who reigned for 58 years before a coup d'√©tat overthrew the monarchy on 15 November 1889. There are two pretenders to the defunct Brazilian throne: Prince Luiz of Orl√©ans-Braganza, head of the Vassouras branch of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and, according to legitimist claims, de jure Emperor of Brazil; and Prince Pedro Carlos of Orl√©ans-Braganza, head of the Petr√≥polis line of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and heir to the Brazilian throne according to royalists. The Brazilian constitution of 1988 called for a general vote on the restoration of the monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragan√ßa and Dom Jo√£o Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Haiti The entire island of Hispaniola was first claimed on 5 December 1492, by Christopher Columbus, for Queen Isabella, and the first Viceroy of the Americas was established along with a number of colonies throughout the Island. With the later discovery of Mexico and Peru many of the early settlers left for the main land, but some twelve cities and a hundred thousand souls remained, mainly in the Eastern part of the Island. Through the Treaty of Riswick in 1697, King Louis XIV received the western third of the Island from Spain as retribution and formalized the first French pirate settlement in existence since the mid-1600s, with the colony administered by a governor-general representing the French crown, an arrangement that stood until the French Revolution toppled the monarchy of France on 21 September 1792. Though the French government retained control over the region of Saint-Domingue, on 22 September 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who had served as Governor-General of Saint-Domingue since 30 November 1803, declared himself as head of an independent Empire of Haiti, with his coronation as Emperor Jacques I taking place on 6 October that year. After his assassination on 17 October 1806, the country was split in half, the northern portion eventually becoming the Kingdom of Haiti on 28 March 1811, with Henri Christophe installed as King Henri I. When King Henri committed suicide on 8 October 1820, and his son, Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti, was murdered by revolutionaries ten days later, the kingdom was merged into the southern Republic of Haiti, of which Faustin-√âlie Soulouque was elected president on 2 March 1847. Two years later, on 26 August 1849, the Haitian national assembly declared the president as Emperor Faustin I, thereby re-establishing the Empire of Haiti. But this monarchical reincarnation was to be short lived as well, as a revolution broke out in the empire in 1858, resulting in Faustin abdicating the throne on 18 January 1859. Inca T√∫pac Amaru, the last Sapa Inca of the Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba The Inca Empire spread across the north western parts of South America between 1438 and 1533, ruled over by a monarch addressed as the Sapa Inca, Sapa, or Apu. The Inca civilization emerged in the Kingdom of Cusco, and expanded to become the Ttahuantin-suyu, or \\"land of the four sections\\", each ruled by a governor or viceroy called Apu-cuna, under the leadership of the central Sapa Inca. The Inca Empire eventually fell to the Spanish in 1533, when the last Sapa Inca of the empire, Atahualpa, was captured and executed on 29 August. The conquerors installed other Sapa Inca beginning with Atahualpa's brother, T√∫pac Huallpa. Manco Inca Yupanqui, originally also a puppet Inca Emperor installed by the Spaniards, rebelled and founded the small independent Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, and the line continued until the death of T√∫pac Amaru in 1572. Maya The Maya civilization was located on the Yucat√°n Peninsula and into the isthmian portion of North America, and the northern portion of Central America (Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras) was formed of a number of ajawil, ajawlel, or ajawlil‚Äì hierarchical polities headed by an hereditary ruler known as a kuhul ajaw (the Mayan term indicating a sovereign leader). Despite constant warfare and shifts in regional power, most Maya kingdoms remained a part of the region's landscape, even following subordination to hegemonic rulers through conquest or dynastic union. Nonetheless, the Maya civilization began its decline in the 8th and 9th centuries, and by the time of the arrival of the Spanish, only a few kingdoms remained, such as the Peten Itza kingdom, Mam, Kaqchikel, and the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj. On 13 March 1697, the last Itza Maya king was defeated at Nojpet√©n by the forces of King Philip IV of Spain. Mexico With the victory of the Mexicans over the Spanish imperial army in 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain came to a conclusion. The newly independent Mexican Congress still desired that King Ferdinand VII, or another member of the House of Bourbon, agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico, thereby forming a type of personal union with Spain. The Spanish monarchy, however, refused to recognise the new state, and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. Thus, the Mexican Agust√≠n de Iturbide was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822, with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following. Only a few months later, Augustine dissolved a factious congress, thereby prompting an enraged Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to mount a coup, which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822. In order to end the unrest, Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country, and the Mexican monarchy was abolished. After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication, Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824, but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and, without trial, was executed. Portrait of Maximilian I of Mexico, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter Benito Ju√°rez, elected as President of Mexico on 19 January 1858, suspended all repayments on Mexico's foreign debts (save those owed to the United States), leading France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took Veracruz in December 1861. Ju√°rez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor Napoleon III of France used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly to the interests of France. Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of Austria, was elevated as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, thereby re-establishing the Mexican monarchy, but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon's wishes, leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico. Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader of the country. As well, at the end of the American Civil War, US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their Monroe Doctrine. Backed by the Americans, ex-president Ju√°rez mobilised to retake power, and defeated Maximilian at Quer√©taro on 15 May 1867. The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed at the Cerro de las Campanas on 19 June 1867. Miskito The Miskito people of Central America were governed by the authority of a monarch, but one who shared his royal powers with a governor and a general. The origins of the monarchy are unknown; however, its sovereignty was lost when King Edward I of the Miskito Nation signed the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with King George II of the United Kingdom, putting the Miskito kingdom under the British protection and law. At the cessation of the American Revolutionary War, King George III of the United Kingdom, via the Treaty of Paris, relinquished control of the Miskito's lands, though Britain continued an unofficial protectorate over the kingdom to protect Miskito interests against Spanish encroachments. After British interest in the region waned, Nicaragua dissolved and occupied the Miskito kingdom in 1894, with the monarch thereafter becoming known as the Hereditary Chief. Norton Cuthbert Clarence is the current pretender to the Miskito Kingdom and Hereditary Chief of the Miskito Nation. Ta√≠no The Ta√≠nos were an indigenous civilization spread across those islands today lying within the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and the northern Lesser Antilles. These regions were divided into kingdoms (the island of Hispaniola alone was segmented into five kingdoms), which were themselves sometimes sub-divided into provinces. Each kingdom was led by a cacique, or \\"chieftain\\", who was advised in his exercise of royal power by a council of priests/healers known as bohiques. The line of succession, however, was matrilineal, whereby if there was no male heir to become cacigue, the title would pass to the eldest child, whether son or daughter, of the deceased's sister. After battling for centuries with the Carib, the Ta√≠no empire finally succumbed to disease and genocide brought by the Spanish colonisers. ===Colonial monarchies=== Courland Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland and Semigallia tried to establish a colony in the Americas. After a number of failed attempts at colonising Tobago, Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland and Semigallia sent one more ship to the island, which landed there on 20 May 1654, carrying soldiers and colonists, who named the island New Courland. At approximately the same time, Dutch colonies were established at other locations on the island, and eventually outgrew those of the Duchy of Courland in population. When the Duke was captured by Swedish forces in 1658, Dutch settlers overtook the Courland colonies, forcing the Governor to surrender. After a return of the territory to Courland through the 1660 Treaty of Oliwa, a number of attempts were made by the next Duke of Courland (Friedrich Casimir Kettler) at re-colonisation, but these met with failure, and he sold New Courland in 1689. France After King Francis I commissioned Jacques Cartier to search out an eastern route to Asia, the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day. Upon several restorations of the monarchy, the royal presence in the Americas ended with the collapse of the Second French Empire under Napoleon III in 1870. Tsar Alexander II, Emperor of Russia, who sold Alaska to the United States of America in 1867 Russia The first permanent Russian settlements in what is today the US state of Alaska were set down in the 1790s, forming Russian Alaska, after Tsar Peter I called for expeditions across the Bering Strait in 1725, with the region administered by the head of the Russian-American Company as the Emperor's representative. Another Russian outpost, Fort Ross, was established in 1812 in what is now California. The colonies, however, were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area, with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700. Fort Ross was sold in 1841, and in 1867, a deal was brokered whereby Tsar Alexander II sold his Alaskan territory to the United States of America for $7,200,000, and the official transfer took place on 30 October that year. Portugal Queen Maria I of Portugal, first Queen of Brazil and the only European monarch to have been born in the Americas. The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves came into being in the wake of Portugal's war with Napoleonic France. The Portuguese Prince Regent, the future King John VI, with his incapacitated mother, Queen Maria I of Portugal and the Royal Court, escaped to the colony of Brazil in 1808. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls for the return of the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the elevation of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy. Spain Beginning in 1492 with the voyages of Christopher Columbus under the direction of Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish Crown amassed a large American empire over three centuries, spreading first from the Caribbean to Central America, most of South America, Mexico, what is today the Southwestern United States, and the Pacific coast of North America up to Alaska. These regions formed the majority of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Viceroyalty of Peru, the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata in each of which the Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy. By the early 19th century, however, the Spanish sovereign's possessions in the Americas began a series of independence movements, which culminated in the Crown's loss of all its colonies on the mainland of North and South America by 1825. The remaining colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico were occupied by the United States following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, ending Spanish rule in the Americas by 1899. Sweden For a period of time the French ceded sovereignty of the island of Saint Barth√©lemy to the Swedes but it was eventually returned. Saint Barth√©lemy (1784‚Äì1878) was operated as a porto Franco (free port). The capital city of Gustavia retains its Swedish name. ===Self-proclaimed monarchies=== 1856 daguerreotype of James Strang These entities were never recognized de jure as legitimate governments, but still sometimes exercised a certain degree of local control or influence within their respective locations until the death of their \\"monarch\\": ;James J. Strang James Strang, a would-be successor to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., proclaimed himself \\"king\\" over his church in 1850, which was then concentrated mostly on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan. On 8 July of that year, he was physically crowned in an elaborate coronation ceremony complete with crown, sceptre, throne, ermine robe and breastplate.Weeks, Robert P. \\"For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory...Briefly\\" American Heritage 21 (4). The sceptre is preserved in the vault of the archives of the Community of Christ church in Independence, Missouri; the whereabouts of Strang's remaining regalia is a mystery. Although he never claimed legal sovereignty over Beaver Island or any other geographical entity, Strang managed (as a member of the Michigan State Legislature) to have his \\"kingdom\\" constituted as a separate county, where his followers held all county offices, and Strang's word was law. U.S. President Millard Fillmore ordered an investigation into Strang's colony, which resulted in Strang's trial in Detroit for treason, trespass, counterfeiting and other crimes, but the jury found the \\"king\\" innocent of all charges. Strang was eventually assassinated by two disgruntled followers in 1856, and his kingdom--together with his royal regalia--vanished. ;Joshua Norton Joshua Abraham Norton, an Englishman who emigrated to San Francisco, California in 1849, proclaimed himself \\"Emperor of These United States\\" in 1859, later adding the title \\"Protector of Mexico\\". Though never recognized by the U.S. or Mexican governments, he was accorded a certain degree of deference within San Francisco itself, including reserved balcony seats (for which he was never charged) at local theatres, and salutes by policemen who passed him on the street. Specially printed currency authorized by Norton was accepted as legal tender within several businesses in the city. When Norton died in 1880, he was given a lavish funeral attended by over 30,000 persons.Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico ;James Harden-Hickey James Harden-Hickey was a self-proclaimed prince, who attempted to establish the so-called Principality of Trinidad on Trindade and the Martim Vaz Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean during the late 19th century. Although initially garnering some newspaper attention, Hickey's claims were ignored or ridiculed by other nations, and the islands eventually were occupied by military forces from nearby Brazil which remain there to the present day. ;Matthew Dowdy Shiell A self-proclaimed monarch of the so-called Kingdom of Redonda, an island in the Caribbean Sea. Whether Shiell ever actually claimed to be king of this tiny islet is open to debate; however, other individuals later claimed the title of \\"King of Redonda,\\" without having apparently ever tried to physically establish themselves on the island itself. ==See also== * Afro- Bolivian monarchy * Canadian Confederation * List of monarchs in the Americas * List of the last monarchs in the Americas * Monarchies in Africa * Monarchies in Europe * Monarchies in Oceania * Monarchism == Notes  References Sources=== * * Category:Americas ","title":"Monarchies in the Americas"},{"id":"20395811","text":"Geoff Molyneux (born 23 January 1943, Warrington) is an English former footballer who played as a Winger. ==Playing career== The younger brother of Liverpool and Chester defender John Molyneux,Now & Then, Chester City v Torquay United matchday programme 12/9/98, p 7 Geoff joined Chester as an amateur from Rylands Youth Club in Warrington in 1962.

However, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be at least 16 years old. This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal contract or otherwise render informed consent for a procedure. Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some states prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed for radiation therapy). In all jurisdictions, individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings, such as refusing any clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal, or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo (such as refusing any work around inappropriate parts of the body). They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork, including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive, or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated. Artists sometimes claim their personal business restrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true, so as to avoid arguments with clients. { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" border=\\"1\\" + Legal Restrictions on Tattooing & Body Modification by State ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"50px\\" State ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"50px\\" Minimum Age (with parent/guardian consent) ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\" Form of Parent/Guardian Consent ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\" Notes & Exceptions ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"75px\\" Intoxicated/Impaired Individuals ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\" Area of Law/Type of Penalty ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\" Licensing & Regulation ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"75px\\" Relevant Statute(s) and Rules - !

The film was directed by award- winning film director Rory Quintos. Love Me Again had its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 6, 2008 and in San Francisco, California on December 7, 2008. It opened in Philippine theaters last January 15, 2009. This film is the first ever Philippine film with an all cast of Filipinos to be shown in a premiere in the United States and this is also the first big-screen team-up of Piolo Pascual and Angel Locsin. ==OverviewProduction=== The cast, including Angel Locsin and Piolo Pascual, trained for weeks in horseback riding at the Manila Polo Club under the guidance of couturiers Vic Barba and Mikee Cojuangco. The film was shot in Impasug-ong and Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. It was also shot in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. The film was retitled from Land Down Under to Love Me Again. ==Plot== Arah (Angel Locsin) dreams of a better life‚Äîdifferent from the life she knows in Bukidnon. Ranches everywhere are closing one by one. The glory her hometown once knew was slowly disappearing in favour of life abroad, particularly in Australia. Arah believes this too. Australia will save them from poverty. But Migo (Piolo Pascual) does not share this belief. He believes that Bukidnon‚Äôs glory will return if only people didn‚Äôt leave. When Arah‚Äôs father suddenly encounters an accident, Arah is left with no choice but to seek better opportunities to earn money. Arah, in desperation accepts money from the Australian rancher Brian in exchange for a contract. Her decision breaks Migo‚Äôs heart. The two part ways, their problems unresolved. With the help of her co-workers, especially her newfound friend, Ina (a Filipina working there as a cook), Arah slowly adjusted to the life in Australia. She is willing to hold her ground and tough it up along with the boys just to fulfill her dreams for herself and her family. It was this determination that caught the attention of the cold and mysterious Brian. Meanwhile, Migo was experiencing his own wave of reality. Bukidnon is not what it used to be. And fighting to keep a ranch alive and working is something he cannot do without enough experience. Despite his enthusiasm and hard work, his investments crumble slowly until he is left with nothing but a humbling realization‚Äîthere is money in Australia, but his dreams shouldn‚Äôt really end there. Migo decides to give the land down under a try. With fierce hopes of earning back what he lost, he flies to Australia, to the land where his beloved Arah went when she left him for her dreams. Suddenly, Migo‚Äôs presence at the ranch is making Arah suspicious. It‚Äôs been years‚Äîwhy is he suddenly there? But destiny has other plans for the two. By a simple twist of fate, the two are thrown together on an errand. The close proximity forces the two to confront their past. And undeniably, their feelings for each other resurface. Will Migo let Arah in her heart again or will she let him go completely for the sake of Brian and her family? And will Migo find the courage to fight for her or learn to accept that he has lost her forever? ==Cast== *Piolo Pascual as Migo *Angel Locsin as Arah *Ricky Davao as Wayne *Ronnie Lazaro as Dodong *Dimples Romana as Yna *Erich Gonzales as Lovely *Nash Aguas as Ariel *John Manalo as Anthony *Brent Metken as Brian *AJ Dee as Koboy *Chanda Romero as Migo's Mom *Dominic Ochoa as Migo's Brother ==Reception== Land Down Under has a total gross of ‚Ç± 65.1 million, according to Box Office Mojo. ==References* Angel Locsin Website * Love Me Again shooting at Bukidnon Category:2008 films Category:Philippine films Category:2008 romantic comedy films Category:Tagalog-language films Category:English-language films Category:Star Cinema comedy films Category:Philippine romantic comedy films Category:Films set in Australia Category:2008 comedy films ","title":"Love Me Again (film)"},{"id":"20395856","text":"The Prix La Fl√®che is a Listed flat horse race in France open to two-year-old thoroughbreds.

It became the All Markets Strategy. The African American Focus works with African American populations in partnerships with the NAACP, various African American churches and other groups. The Hispanic/Latino Focus includes the ¬°Scouting - Vale La Pena! emphasis for Hispanic youth that provides Spanish language resources such as handbooks, training material, and videos. The Soccer and Scouting emphasis is a partnership with the National Soccer Coaches Association of America to provide alternatives for Cub Scout age Hispanic youth. The Asian American Focus reaches out to Indo-Chinese American, Vietnamese American, Chinese American, and Korean American communities. The Rural Scouting focus targets small communities and includes the American Indian Scouting Association in partnership with the Girl Scouts of the USA. In 2004, the Scoutreach division launched the Scouting and Soccer program with an emphasis on outreach to Hispanic/Latino youth and families. ==History== An integrated Scout troop from Philadelphia, at Camp Hart in 1971 Protests over the inclusion of African Americans arose early in the program. When W.D. Boyce departed the organization, he turned the Boy Scout corporation over to the members of the Executive Board with the stipulation that the Boy Scouts would not discriminate on the basis of race or creed. The BSA accepted Boyce's condition, yet by the 1914 Annual Meeting, it adopted a policy allowing local councils to deny membership to African Americans. One segregated council (Old Hickory Council, North Carolina) completed its integration plans in 1974, merging two white districts and one black district ten years after the passage of the federal civil rights act. Scout leader recruiting Latino youth in New York City The BSA began expanding the Negro Scouting program: by 1927 thirty- two communities in the south had \\"colored troops\\", with twenty-six troops in Louisville, Kentucky. However, during its first fifty years, the BSA struggled with minority communities because they were not seen as a source of strong membership. At the end of the 1960s, the national leadership saw the underserved communities, primarily in urban areas, and created their new \\"Urban Emphasis.\\" The BSA's modernization and new \\"urban emphasis\\" was consistent with similar trends in Scouting all over the world starting in the 1960s. Much of these changes could be seen in the 8th Edition of the Boy Scout Handbook used from 1972 - 79. The Urban Emphasis program, and some other Hispanic outreach initiatives, Alt URL were the forerunner of today's \\"Scoutreach.\\" Since the adoption of the 1914 racial policy, the African American community has struggled to allow African Americans to join the BSA and then endured segregated facilities and programs. Even after the Brown decision in 1954 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the BSA refused to reject its 1914 racial policy. It was a NAACP 1974 lawsuit against the LDS and the BSA which finally forced the BSA to issue a non-discrimination policy on the basis of race.

She is recognized by two fellow con artists, Gwen and Brad. Since they know she has not reported to her parole board, she reluctantly helps them set up a wealthy, married man; when her outraged \\"husband\\" (Brad) breaks in and finds them in a compromising situation, the victim is glad to pay $10,000 to avoid any publicity. Later, however, the patsy realizes he has been taken and goes to the police. Brad has Gwen hide the money, and tells Dolly that their victim stopped payment on his check. Dolly steals the money and makes a quick getaway. Soon after, Dolly meets a young man named Steve Crandall in Atlantic City for a cement convention. Believing that he is a wealthy plantation owner, she flirts with him. When he proposes they get married that very night, Dolly is shocked, but accepts. She is packing to leave with Steve when Brad shows up, demanding his share of the $10,000. Once again, Dolly uses her wits to escape. Dolly and Steve take the train south to his home town of Winthrop, Alabama. There Dolly is rudely surprised to discover that Steve is far from rich, nor does he own a plantation (though he lives next door to one). He is certain his invention, Enduro cement, will make his fortune, but his new wife is not so sure. Dolly has grown fond of Steve, but cannot hide her disappointment from him. That evening, she has him take her to a train for New York. The next morning, however, Steve returns to his room to find Dolly curled up in a chair. She is in love with him and has decided to reform, though she keeps her past a secret. Brad and Gwen track her down, certain she has landed yet another rich sucker. They are surprised to find her living in modest circumstances. Dolly tells them that she has fallen for a poor man, but they do not believe her. To get rid of them, she gives them the $10,000. However, Steve receives a telegram informing him that a company has bought his cement formula for $100,000. Overjoyed, he rushes home and tells Dolly, his mother, and \\"cousins\\" Brad and Gwen. Brad and Gwen blackmail Dolly into a scheme to part Steve from his new-found riches. Brad invites the couple to stay with him in New York City. Just as Steve is about to sign Brad's contract, Dolly cannot take it anymore. She telephones the police, then tells Steve that the contract is nothing but a scam; she then confesses to Steve that she herself is a crook and that she only married him in order to fleece him. Steve is devastated. The cops show up and take her away. Steve begs Dolly to come back to him, but she says that he would be better off without her. Dolly is taken to prison. Steve, however, manages to get the warden to parole her into his custody. ==Cast== * Norma Shearer as Dolly \\"Angel Face\\" Morgan Crandall * Lowell Sherman as Bradley / \\"Brad\\" * Gwen Lee as Gwen * Johnny Mack Brown as Steve Crandall * Eugenie Besserer as Ma Crandall * Buddy Messinger as Hank Crandall ==ReferencesCategory:American films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Robert Z.

Perryman caught the eye at the age of 17 in 1973, when he took 6/44 in 23 overs for Warwickshire Young Amateurs as they beat their Buckinghamshire counterparts in the Hilda Overy Trophy. He had played for Warwickshire's Second XI before the year was out, and appeared several more times in early 1974 before making his first-class debut in early July against Cambridge University at Nuneaton; it proved to be rather a frustrating debut as he neither batted nor bowled in a game in which little play was possible. That was his only first-team appearance of the season, although he did play for England Young Cricketers in two Youth Test matches against West Indies Young Cricketers a few weeks later. In 1975, however, Perryman played a full part in the season, finishing with 49 first-class wickets at just over 30 and 22 List A victims at a little over 32. He did not play quite so often the following year, but nevertheless managed three five-wicket hauls in first- class innings. In 1977 he enjoyed a successful time in three-day cricket especially: his 73 first-class wickets were his highest season's aggregate, and included 11 wickets against Middlesex in August. Wisden was impressed, saying that he had \\"more than confirmed the promise of the previous season\\" and had continued \\"to mature in the Cartwright mould\\". WG Wanklyn, \\"Warwickshire in 1977\\". Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1978. London: Sporting Handbooks, 571. Perryman had another fairly successful summer in 1978, claiming exactly 50 first-class wickets. In the middle of June he took 12 wickets in the match against Lancashire, and a little over two months later he recorded his career best when he took a match-winning second-innings 7/49 against Hampshire. Earlier in the season he had also recorded his List A best, albeit against lesser opposition in the form of Minor Counties West in the Benson & Hedges Cup. He took 51 first-class wickets in 1979, also claiming 26 List A victims (his most), but in 1980 he did not become a first-team regular until near the end of the season. In the 1981 season Perryman averaged 43 in first-class cricket and 38 in the one-day game, his wicket totals roughly halving from 1980 in both forms of the game. At the end of the year he left Edgbaston and joined Worcestershire, where he played for two seasons. He did have some successes at his new county, such as the 6/49 he managed against Lancashire in August 1982, but he could never quite establish himself as a true regular in the side, and in 1983 he was almost absent from one-day cricket, bowling just 13 overs. He played his final Worcestershire game, against Essex, in late August, rounding off his Warwickshire career with the single wicket of former West Indies Test player Norbert Phillip. After that, Perryman was seen no more at first-class level, though he did appear several times for Staffordshire in 1988, playing one List A match for the minor county when he turned out against Surrey in the NatWest Trophy in June. ==NotesReferences== * Category:English cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Staffordshire cricketers Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Cricketers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English cricketers of 1969 to 2000 ","title":"Stephen Perryman"},{"id":"20396274","text":"Ralph Tunnicliff Catterall (14 March 1897 ‚Äì 8 October 1978), judge of the Virginia State Corporation Commission,John T.

The elections took place after both the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan resigned to resolve a power struggle. Prior to the elections, the ruling Islami Jamhoori Ittehad alliance was dissolved due to clashes between its member parties. The alliance's place in the two-party system (alongside the Pakistan Peoples Party) was taken up by Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N). The elections were held under the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi. Although the PML (N) received the most votes, the PPP won the most seats. After winning the support of minor parties and independents, Benazir Bhutto became Prime Minister for a second non-consecutive term. Voter turnout was 40.3%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p678 ==Background== The Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) won the 1990 election and the party's leader, Nawaz Sharif, became Prime Minister. In early 1993 he attempted to strip the President of the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, National Assembly and regional assemblies. However, in April 1993 President Khan dismissed Sharif for corruption and called elections for 14 July after dissolving the National Assembly. Sharif immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which in May ruled by 10 to 1 that Khan had exceeded his powers and therefore restored Sharif as Prime Minister. Khan and Sharif then began to battle for control of Pakistan for the next two months. They both attempted to secure control over the regional assemblies and in particular, Punjab. In Punjab this saw a staged kidnapping and the moving of 130 members of the Punjab Assembly to the capital to ensure they stayed loyal to Sharif. Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party Benazir Bhutto threatened to lead a march on Islamabad unless new elections were called. Finally on 18 July, under pressure from the army to resolve the power struggle, Sharif and Khan resigned as Prime Minister and President respectively. Elections for the National Assembly were called for 6 October with elections for the regional assemblies set to follow shortly afterwards. ==Campaign== Until the election the chairman of the Senate, Wasim Sajjad became interim president and former World Bank executive Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi became caretaker prime minister. The interim government cut spending, introduced a tax on rich landowners and cracked down on corruption and drug traffickers. They were praised for stabilising the country while the campaign took place but their policies were criticised by the two main political leaders, Sharif and Bhutto. In total 1,485 candidates stood in the election but the main fight was between the PML-N of Nawaz Sharif and the PPP of Benazir Bhutto. Their policies were very similar but saw a clash of personalities with both parties making many promises but not explaining how they were going to pay for them. Sharif stood on his record of privatisations and development projects and pledged to restore his taxi giveaway program. Bhutto promised price supports for agriculture, pledged a partnership between government and business and campaigned strongly for the female vote. Opinion polls showed a very close election between the two main parties but there was a lot of cynicism among voters. The army was credited with making sure that the election was fair and deployed 150,000 troops in polling stations to ensure this. ==Results== The PPP won the most seats in the election at 86 but failed to gain a majority with the PML-N second with 73 seats. This was also the first election in Pakistan in which the party that won the popular vote, the PML-N, failed to win the most seats. The PPP performed strongly in Bhutto's native Sindh and rural Punjab, while the PML-N was strongest in industrial Punjab and the largest cities such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.

Carvalho was also an influential writer, penning the play Dance of the Dead God for the Experimental Theater in 1933. Carvalho was noted for his experimental designs, such as a scheme for the Governor's Palace in S√£o Paulo in 1927 (unbuilt), the Main House at Capuava Ranch and a residential complex at Alameda Lorena.

He attended high school in Tokyo and went on to study economics at Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo). After World War II, Irino, along with colleagues Minao Shibata and Kunio Toda, studied the twelve-tone method of composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg. In 1951, Irino used the composition technique to compose his Concerto da Camera for Seven Instruments. This work is credited to be the first Japanese dodecaphonic composition.„ÄéÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆ‰ΩúÊõ≤20‰∏ñÁ¥Ä„ÄèÔºàÈü≥Ê•Ω‰πãÂèãÁ§æÔºâ142È†Å and Áèæ‰ª£Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„Ç™„Éº„Ç±„Çπ„Éà„É©Èü≥Ê•ΩÁ¨¨28ÂõûÊºîÂ•è‰ºö „Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„É† During the same time, the magazine Ongaku Geijutsu published two articles by Irino: \\"Schoenberg's Composing Technique\\" and \\"What is Twelve-Tone Music?\\" Subsequently, Irino used the twelve-tone technique in numerous compositions and wrote extensively about contemporary music. Working to introduce foreign contemporary music and music literature to Japan, he made Japanese translations of important books such as Die Komposition mit zw√∂lf T√∂nen (12Èü≥„Å´„Çà„Çã‰ΩúÊõ≤ÊäÄÊ≥ï) by Josef Rufer and Schoenberg and His School („Ç∑„Çß„Éº„É≥„Éô„É´„ÇØ„Å®„Åù„ÅÆÊ•ΩÊ¥æ) by Ren√© Leibowitz. Irino did not, however, compose serial music, a technique of the same period widely used with the Darmstadt School. In 1973, the Asian Composers League was established by Irino and his colleagues. After his death, the Irino Award and the Yoshiro Irino Memorial Prize (sponsored by the Asian Composers League) were established to promote young composers.

In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobs‚Äîthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off trans person, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot- tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors. ==Cast== *Evan Ross as Romeo *Stephanie Lugo as Debbie, Romeo's girlfriend *Shannyn Sossamon as Concetta a woman faced with the challenges of raising her sick child, wife of Manny *Victor Rasuk as her husband Manny, who supports Concetta and his baby by working the front desk of a drug-infested tenement building by day and an often-robbed bodega at night *Lara Flynn Boyle as a faded and cruel prostitute named Betty McBain *Thomas Ian Nicholas as Chad Wesley a rookie cop *Vondie Curtis-Hall as street-toughened veteran cop *Kerry Washington as Marybeth/Mickey, a transsexual prostitute *Desmond Harrington as Benny, MaryBeth's \\"husband\\" *Mark Webber as Ridley/Gabrielle, a transgender prostitute and friend of MaryBeth *Brandon Routh as Sizemore, a homeless drug addict who sometimes talks to Willy Brandon Routh Learns \\"Life Is Hot in Cracktown\\": www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00007786.html *RZA as a drug dealer named Sammy, who does business with RomeoRZA Says ‚ÄòLife Is Hot In Cracktown‚Äô *Carly Pope as Stacy *Tony Plana as an alcoholic man *Ridge Canipe as Willy, the older brother of Susie *Edoardo Ballerini as Chas, Mommy's abusive boyfriend *Illeana Douglas as Mommy, the heavily addicted mother of Willy and Susie *Elena Franklin as Melody Amber *Mayte Garcia as Murietta *Ariel Winter as Susie *Omar Regan as Cremont *Jeremy West as Mr. Rutherford, a crippled pensioner robbed by Romeo *Bryan Becker as Pepperton ==ReferencesCategory:2009 crime drama films Category:American crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Buddy Giovinazzo Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:2009 films Category:2009 LGBT- related films Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films about trans women Category:2009 drama films ","title":"Life Is Hot in Cracktown"},{"id":"20396419","text":"√úlo Ilmar Sooster (October 17, 1924 in √úhtri, K√§ina Parish - October 25, 1970 in Moscow)http://www.geni.com/people/%C3%9Clo-Sooster/6000000007790132273 was an Estonian nonconformist painter. √úlo Sooster was born the village of √úhtri on the island of Hiiumaa.

She became the first infant subject of a xenotransplant procedure and first successful infant heart transplant, receiving the heart of a baboon. Though she died within a month of the procedure, she lived weeks longer than any previous recipient of a non- human heart. ==Procedure== The procedure, performed by Leonard Lee Bailey at Loma Linda University Medical Center, was successful, but Fae died 21 days later of heart failure due to rejection of the transplant. The rejection is thought to have been caused largely by a humoral response against the graft, due to Fae's type O blood creating antibodies against the type AB xenograft. The blood type incompatibility was seen as unavoidable: fewer than 1% of baboons are type O, and Loma Linda only had seven young female baboons‚Äîall of which were type AB‚Äîavailable as potential donors. A baboon heart was used as there was no time for a suitable human heart to be found. It was hoped that the transplant could be replaced by an allograft at a later date, before Fae's body began generating isohaemagglutinins, but a suitable donor could not be found in time. Prior to the procedure, no infant heart transplant‚Äîeven with human hearts‚Äîhad been successfully performed due to a lack of infant human hearts. To address this issue, Bailey had become a pioneer in the research of cross-species heart transplants, which had included \\"more than 150 transplants in sheep, goats, and baboons\\". Multiple surgeons had previously experimented with baboon heart implants, leading some to speculate even that baboons could be farmed in the future for such purposes. When asked why he had picked a baboon over a primate more closely related to humans in evolution, Bailey replied, \\"I don't believe in evolution.\\" Though she died within a month, Baby Fae, at the time of her death, had lived two weeks longer than any previous recipient of a non-human heart. ==Ethics== The procedure was subject to a wide ethical and legal debate, but the attention that it generated is thought to have paved the way for Bailey to perform the first successful infant allograft heart transplant a year later. The Baby Fae case, and Bailey's role in it, has been a popular case study in the realm of medical ethics. There were questions as to whether parents should be allowed to volunteer children for experimental medical procedures, and whether the parents themselves were properly informed by Bailey. The case further brought up debates regarding the risk/benefit ratio that should be considered ethical when dealing with experimental procedures on human subjects. Charles Krauthammer, writing in Time, said the Baby Fae case was totally within the realm of experimentation and was \\"an adventure in medical ethics\\".Charles Krauthammer, Essay: The Using of Baby Fae, Time, December 3, 1984, accessed May 28, 2013. Ultimately, the American Medical Association and top medical journals criticized Bailey, concluding that xenografts should be undertaken only as part of a systematic research program with controls in randomized clinical trials. The validity of the consent obtained in the case of Baby Fae has also been largely criticized. Bailey originally alleged that he obtained consent following a long discussion with the mother and father. It was later revealed, however, that the father was not present at the time of consent. The information in the consent form was also changed after the mother originally saw it. The original phrasing stated that the procedure could potentially extend Baby Fae's life \\"long term\\". Although Fae's full name was not made public at the time of the procedure, her mother chose to reveal herself in 1997. ==In popular culture== The Paul Simon song \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" from the 1986 Graceland album references her in the lyrics: \\"Medicine is magical and magical is art / Thinking of the Boy in the Bubble / And the baby with the baboon heart.\\" In the 1993 episode \\"I Love Lisa\\" of The Simpsons, the school cafeteria serves beef hearts in honor of Valentine's Day. Bart Simpson puts one under his shirt, exclaiming \\"My baboon heart! Body ... rejecting it!\\" before dramatically everting it onto the table. Christian Slater's character in the 1993 film Untamed Heart was inspired by Baby Fae, and the film was originally titled The Baboon Heart in tribute to her. Screenwriter Tom Serchio later said that when writing the screenplay, he was thinking less of Baby Fae directly and that it was more about being intrigued by the Paul Simon song and the lyrics that reference her. In the 2010 episode ‚ÄúThe Silent Partners‚Äù of the Adult Swim cartoon, The Venture Bros., Billy Quizboy refers to Monstroso as ‚ÄúBaby Fae‚Äù before performing experimental heart surgery on him, transplanting Monstroso‚Äôs failing heart with the heart of the recently deceased villain, King Gorilla.

Introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, it has been a popular type of casual apparel with both men and women and has been described as an iconic element of American fashion. Though a staple of western wear, the denim jacket has also enjoyed a more general appeal. ==History== The first recorded denim jacket was created in the United States in about 1880 by Levi Strauss, approximately ten years after he had invented jeans as a new type of work apparel intended for use by cowboys, miners, and railroad workers. The \\"Type III\\" denim jacket, introduced by Levis Strauss & Co. in 1962, has been described as the Denim jacket \\"to rule them all\\". Also known as \\"the trucker jacket\\", design elements of the Type III include a tapered style, welt hand pockets, and bar tacks which hold down chest pocket and sleeve openings. In 2017, Google collaborated with Levi Strauss & Co. to develop a \\"connected\\" denim jacket described by Wired as the \\"denim jacket of the future\\". The underlying technology, named \\"Jacquard,\\" encompassed a processor, a built-in battery, and a special yarn that gave the bottom of the arm a pseudo-touchscreen functionality. The same year, New York Fashion Week featured several denim jackets, with The Guardian predicting that the denim jacket would \\"be everywhere in 2018\\". A second version of the Jacquard jacket, featuring an appearance closer to jackets without the technology as well as a lower price, was released in late 2019. In addition to Levi Strauss & Co., other designers of denim jackets have included Wrangler, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, Gucci, and Dior, among others. A woman models a denim jacket. ==Cultural impact== According to GQ, there are \\"few things more iconic, more innately American, than a denim jacket\\" and the magazine has called it \\"a staple for stylish men\\". Jean jackets have also been popular with women. Jean jackets, like jeans, are a major element of western wear, however, also like jeans, have enjoyed a more general appeal. Notable wearers of jean jackets have included western entertainers James Dean and John Lennon, as well as Polish anti-Communist dissident Jacek Kuro≈Ñ. In 2017 GQ opined that Kanye West seemed to own \\"an alarming number of jean jackets\\", remarking that \\"he doesn't seem to go a few days without wearing one\\". According to Levi Strauss & Co., the jean jacket has traditionally appealed to nonconformists as \\"a knock to the 'suits' of the world, its informal yet edgy heritage making it the ideal item to stick it to the man\\". ==Wear and styling== While jean jackets are predominantly found in blue, denim can be dyed any color achievable with cotton, so jackets in colors such as white and violet also exist. As with jeans themselves, it is possible to buy \\"raw\\" or \\"dry\\" denim jean jackets, which have not been washed or distressed at the factory and instead fade and break in naturally over time with wear. Jean jackets with sherpa lining for warmth are available. ===Canadian tuxedo=== A \\"Canadian tuxedo\\" is a colloquial term for wearing a jean shirt or denim jacket with jeans. The term reportedly originated in 1951 after Bing Crosby was refused entry to a hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia due to wearing a denim top and denim bottoms. After learning of the incident, Levi Strauss & Co. designed a tuxedo made entirely of denim for Crosby as a publicity stunt. Despite its name, the \\"Canadian tuxedo\\" is not a specifically Canadian style, but is also closely correlated with images in American pop culture, such as the Marlboro Man.Hannah Ongley, \\"the controversial american history of the canadian tuxedo\\". i-D, January 5, 2018. The Crosby incident has been credited with helping to spur the evolution of denim from blue collar work wear into a fashion staple;Vienna Vernose, \\"The History of the Canadian Tuxedo: How the fashion faux pas became a runway staple\\". CR Fashion Book, April 24, 2019. however, the popularity of the full \\"Canadian tuxedo\\" look has varied, being accepted as stylish and on trend at some times and as a fashion faux pas at others. Some fashion stylists have asserted that the look works better if the jeans and the jacket are different colours than it does if they're the same shade.Scott Christian, \\"Why You Should Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Canadian Tuxedo\\". Esquire, June 16, 2016. The \\"Canadian tuxedo\\" has also sometimes been interpreted as including a flannel shirt under the jacket,Scott Stinson, \\"Redblacks bring winning mindset to title game\\". Windsor Star, November 25, 2016. although this is not a universal definition. The Canadian tuxedo achieved a \\"pop cultural peak\\" in 2001 when Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake wore the combination to that year's American Music Awards.

It was formerly classified within the now-obsolete order Lycoperdales, which, following a restructuring of fungal taxonomy brought about by molecular phylogeny, has been split; the species of Bovista are now placed in the family Agaricaceae of the order Agaricales. Bovista species have a collectively widespread distribution, and are found largely in temperate regions of the world. Various species have historically been used in homeopathic preparations. ==Description== Fruit bodies are oval to spherical to pear- shaped, and typically in diameter with a white or light-colored thin and fragile exoperidum (outer layer of the peridium). Depending on the species, the exoperidium in a young specimen may be smooth, granular, or finely echinulate. This exoperidium sloughs off at maturity to expose a smooth endoperidium with a single apical pore (ostiole). The fruit bodies may be attached to the ground by fine rhizomorphs that may appear like a small cord. Some species develop a subgleba‚Äîa sterile base that is typically not well developed. The fruit bodies of mature specimens can develop surface alterations such as scales, plates, areolae, or verrucae. At the microscopic level, these features are made of hyphae, sphaerocysts (rounded cells), claviform (club-shaped) cells. Bovista sclerocystis is the only species in the genus with mycosclereids (setoid elements) in the peridium. Spores are brown to purple-brown, roughly spherical or ellipsoid in shape, and 3.5‚Äì7 Œºm in diameter. A short or long pedicel (stalk) may be present. At maturity, the entire fruit body may become detached from the ground, and the spores spread as the puffball is blown around like a tumbleweed. In Bovista, the capillitium (a network of thread-like cells in which the spores are embedded) is not connected directly to the interior wall of the peridium. Instead, it is made of separate, irregularly branched units that end in tapered points. This type of capillitium, also present in the puffball genera Calbovista and Bovistella, has been called the \\"Bovista\\" type by Hanns Kreisel, who published a monograph on Bovista in 1967. Kreisel also defined the \\"Lycoperdon\\"-type (a capillitium comprising long, threads with occasional dichotomous or irregular branches), and the \\"intermediate\\" type (a transitional form between the Bovista type and Lycoperdon type, featuring threads that may be pored, with several thick main stems connected by multiple branches). All three types of capillitia structure are found in Bovista. \\"Bovista\\"-type capillitia are elastic, a feature shared with the gasteroid genera Lycoperdon and Geastrum. The flexibility of the capillitium gives the gleba a cottony texture that persists even after the exoperidium has been sloughed off. ==Systematics== Illustration of Bovista plumbea from James Sowerby's 1797 work Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms The genus was originally described by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1794. He described the genus as \\"Cortice exteriore libero evanefcente, pileo acauli demum glaberrimo, vertice irregulariter rupto\\" (\\"Exterior cortex vanishes, cap stemless becoming smooth, irregularly breaking the top\\"). Synonyms include Piesmycus (Rafinesque 1808), Piemycus (Rafinesque 1813), Sackea (Rostkovius 1844), Globaria (Qu√©let 1873), and Pseudolycoperdon (Velenovsk√Ω 1947). Bovista plumbea is the type species. Kreisel, in his 1967 monograph, proposed two subgenera based on the type of capillitium. Subgenus Globaria has species of the Lycoperdon type, while subgenus Bovista is represented by the Bovista-type or intermediate capillitium. Further divisions into sections and series is based on the capillitium type, the absence or presence of pores in the capillitia, and the presence or absence of a subgleba (a sterile base). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Bovista, as defined by Kreisel, is monophyletic. Also, Bovista may be split into two clades, Bovista and Globaris, that roughly correspond to the subgeneric divisions suggested by Kreisel. ==Edibility== Puffballs of the genus Bovista are generally edible when young and white inside, but caution must be taken to prevent confusion with immature, and potentially deadly Amanitas. This is done by cutting fruit bodies longitudinally to ensure that they are white throughout, and do not have internal structures within. ==Related genera== Bovistina is a related but separate genus that was created to describe species with the external features of a puffball, but with the glebal characters of a Geaster. Bovistella is another similar genus, it may be distinguished from Bovista by its ample sterile base. ==Use in homeopathy== Reference to the genus has appeared in several 19th-century textbooks on homeopathy. Richard Hughes wrote in A Manual of Pharmacodynamics (1870) \\"Bovista is said to be indicated, and to have proved curative in head affections characterised by a sensation as if the head were enormously increased in size\\". In Lectures on Clinical Materia Medica (1887), E. A. Farrington claims that Bovista spores restrict blood circulation through the capillaries, and suggests uses associated with menstrual irregularity, or trauma. He also mentions that Bovista produces some symptoms of suffocation, and might be useful in remedying asphyxiation resulting from inhalation of charcoal fumes. Even more ailments have been suggested to be improved with use of Bovista, such as \\"awkwardness in speech and action\\", \\"stuttering or stammering children\\", \\"palpitation after a meal\\", diabetes mellitus, ovarian cysts, and \\"acne due to cosmetics\\". ==Species== The Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008) estimates there are 55 Bovista species worldwide. Index Fungorum lists 92 species that it considers to be valid. * Bovista acocksii : reported in South Africa * Bovista acuminata * Bovista aenea * Bovista aestivalis ‚Äì California * Bovista africana * Bovista albosquamosa * Bovista apedicellata * Bovista amethystina * Bovista antarctica * Bovista arachnoides * Bovista ardosiaca * Bovista aspara * Bovista betpakdalinica * Bovista bovistoides * Bovista brunnea * Bovista cacao * Bovista californica * Bovista capensis * Bovista cisneroi * Bovista citrina * Bovista colorata * Bovista concinna * Bovista coprophila * Bovista cretacea * Bovista cunninghamii * Bovista dakotensis * Bovista dealbata * Bovista dermoxantha : reported causing fairy rings in Chiba City (Japan) * Bovista dominicensis * Bovista dryina * Bovista dubiosa * Bovista elegans * Bovista flaccida * Bovista flavobrunnea * Bovista fuegiana : reported from Tierra del Fuego, Argentina * Bovista gunnii * Bovista fulva * Bovista fusca * Bovista glacialis * Bovista glaucocinerea * Bovista grandipora * Bovista graveolens * Bovista grisea * Bovista gunnii * Bovista halophila * Bovista herrerae * Bovista heterocapilla * Bovista himalaica * Bovista hungarica * Bovista incarnata * Bovista jonesii * Bovista kazachstanica * Bovista kurczumensis * Bovista kurgaldzhinica * Bovista lauterbachii * Bovista leonoviana * Bovista leucoderma * Bovista limosa : Originally collected in Iceland * Bovista longicauda * Bovista longispora * Bovista longissima * Bovista lycoperdoides * Bovista macrospora * Bovista magellanica * Bovista minor * Bovista membranacea * Bovista monticola * Bovista nigra * Bovista nigrescens ‚Äì Brown puffball, black bovist * Bovista oblongispora * Bovista ochrotricha * Bovista paludosa ‚Äì Fen puffball * Bovista perpusilla * Bovista pila ‚Äì Tumbling puffball * Bovista plumbea ‚Äì Paltry Puffball, grey puffball * Bovista polymorpha * Bovista promontorii * Bovista pulyuggeodes * Bovista pusilla ‚Äì Dwarf puffball * Bovista pusilloformis : found in Finland * Bovista radicata * Bovista reunionis * Bovista ruizii * Bovista schwarzmanniana * Bovista sclerocystis : reported from Mexico * Bovista sempervirentium * Bovista septima * Bovista singeri : reported from Nor Yungas, Bolivia * Bovista spinulosa * Bovista sublaevispora : reported form Vi√±a del Mar, Chile * Bovista substerilis * Bovista sulphurea * Bovista termitum * Bovista tomentosa * Bovista trachyspora * Bovista umbrina * Bovista uruguayensis * Bovista vascelloides :reported from Nepal * Bovista vassjaginiana * Bovista verrucosa * Bovista yasudae * Bovista zeyheri Bovista aestivalis.jpg Bovista aestivalis Bovista nigrescens BS17.jpg Bovista nigrescens Golden Puffball.jpg Bovista colorata ==See also== *List of Agaricaceae genera *List of Agaricales genera ==References * California Fungi * Trial field key to the LYCOPERDACEAE & GEASTRACEAE in the Pacific Northwest * The Gasteromycetes of the Eastern United States and Canada, pp. 97‚Äî100 Category:Agaricaceae Category:Edible fungi Category:Agaricales genera Category:Puffballs ","title":"Bovista"},{"id":"20396859","text":"The Usk Ferry is a cable ferry across the Skeena River in British Columbia, Canada.

He commanded a brigade and then a division in the Army of the Ohio in several campaigns in the Western Theater of operations.Warner, pp. 393-94. ==Early life and career== Reilly was born May 20, 1828, in Akron, Ohio. He was educated at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and later studied law. He passed his bar exam and established a successful practice in Wellsville, Ohio, in Columbiana County. In 1858, he entered politics, and was elected as a Republican to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he eventually supported the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. ==Civil War service== In August 1862, Reilly joined the military, accepting an appointment as the colonel of the 104th Ohio Infantry. After training at Camp Massillon, he and his men were assigned to various garrisons and posts in Kentucky, where they operated against Edmund Kirby Smith and John Hunt Morgan. Reilly and the regiment moved to Covington, Kentucky, on September 1, 1862, in preparation for the Defense of Cincinnati against a threatened Confederate invasion by troops under Kirby Smith. Reilly was then involved in the subsequent Skirmish at Fort Mitchell in northern Kentucky. In the summer of 1863, Reilly's 104th OVI was assigned to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's Army of the Ohio during its campaign in East Tennessee, including operations around the Cumberland Gap. They marched to Knoxville and joined the XXIII Corps. In the autumn of 1863, Reilly commanded a brigade of infantry in the XXIII Corps during the Siege of Knoxville.Reilly's brigade consisted of the 100th Ohio, 104th Ohio, and 8th Tennessee infantry regiments. The following year, he led his brigade with competence during the Atlanta Campaign. On July 30, 1864, Reilly was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers. Assigned command of the 3rd Division, XXIII Corps previously commanded by Jacob D. Cox, he performed well during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. During the Battle of Franklin, his troops initially broke in disarray under a heavy Confederate assault, but General Reilly managed to rally them and repulse the attack, capturing more than 1,000 prisoners and seizing 22 Confederate battle flags.Hubbell, pp. 431-32. Reilly and his men were assigned in 1865 to the forces of Maj. Gen. John Schofield and participated in the Carolinas Campaign. He resigned from the army on April 20, 1865, and returned to Ohio. ==Postbellum career== Reilly resumed his legal career in Wellsville and became active in community affairs. He remained a force in local politics and helped support numerous Republican candidates. In 1873, he was a delegate to the Ohio state constitutional convention from Columbiana County. He died in Wellsville at the age of 77 and was buried in its St. Elizabeth's Cemetery. Upon death, his estate was awarded to the State of Ohio. There is a stadium and grade school in Salem, Ohio that was funded from part of his estate and bear his name to this date. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Palo Alto, California: Stanford University Press, 2001, . * Heidler, David S., and Heidler, Jeanne T., eds., Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, W.

It was launched in 1854. It was sold to the Pavonia Ferry Company of Jersey City for what was considered a low price of $9,050, at New York City Hall, in February 1854.Erie Railroad Terminal The ferry takes its name for Pavonia, the first European settlement on the west bank of the Hudson first established in 1633 as part of New Netherland and later expanded to region known as Bergen. In February 1859 Nathaniel Marsh of the Erie Railroad Company purchased the lease on behalf of the Pavonia Ferry Company. He started a ferry which ran from Chambers Street (Manhattan) to the foot of Pavonia Avenue on the other side of the Hudson Waterfront. Legal problems had prevented the Pavonia Ferry Company from establishing a ferry along this route. The New York and Erie Railroad paid an annual rent of $9,050 to transport passengers back and forth. Eventually the railroad constructed its Pavonia Terminal on the landfilled Harsimus Cove. Suburban and long distance travellers would transfer from trains to boats for the passage across the river. Service to 23rd Street began in 1869. A January 18, 1903 letter from a Passaic, New Jersey reader to The New York Times, commented about the inadequacy of the boats of the Pavonia Ferry, which was then the property of the Erie Railroad. \\"All their boats are old, small and entirely inadequate to accommodate the crowds during rush hours.\\" The vessels then in use by the Erie Railroad, listed with first year of service, were: Pavonia (1861), Susquehanna (1865), Delaware (1868), Chatauqua (1868), Passaic (1869), Ridgewood (1873), Paterson (1886), and J.G.

He was the first head coach of the Washington State Cougars football team, holding that position for the 1894 college football season. Goodyear was also a newspaper publisher and editor. His newspapers included the Pullman Herald, the Pullman News, the Colfax Commoner in Colfax, Washington, the Palouse City News in Palouse, Washington, and the Pacific Farmers' Union. He was also active in Democratic Party politics and was the party's candidate for United States Congress in Washington's 3rd congressional district in 1908. ==Early years and family== Goodyear was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1865 to Hannah (n√©e Tuttle) and George Goodyear. He was described as coming from \\"good New England stock,\\" and was a direct descendant of Stephen Goodyear, who served as deputy governor of the New Haven Plantation from 1643 to 1658. He attended public schools and graduated from Newton High School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Goodyear attended Williams College and received his bachelor of arts degree there in 1887. While attending Williams, he was a member and president of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, editor of the Literary Monthly, and a member of the college football and tug of war teams. One week after completing his degree at Williams College, Goodyear moved west and settled in Spokane, Washington (then known as \\"Spokane Falls\\") in 1887. He entered the newspaper business as a reporter for the Spokane Falls Review (later known as The Spokesman-Review) from 1887 to 1889, eventually becoming the city editor. In November 1890, he was married to Neva Carleton Shurtleff at a ceremony in Warren, Rhode Island. They had a son, Trevor Shurtleff Goodyear, born in January 1893 at Palouse, Washington. ==Football coach== In 1894, Goodyear became the first football coach at Washington State College (now known as Washington State University). He reportedly traveled from his home in Palouse, Washington each night to perform his coaching duties. Goodyear was not paid for teaching the team the elements of the game, and the school did not have a paid coach until 1900. In the first game in the history of the Washington State Cougars football program, played on November 18, 1894, in Moscow, Idaho, Goodyear led the team to a 10‚Äì0 victory over Idaho. Eleven days later, the team suffered its first defeat, losing to the team from Spokane High School by a score of 18‚Äì0. Goodyear served only one year as the football coach, leading the team to a record of 1‚Äì1.College Football Reference Washington State University Football RecordsMiami Herald Washington State University all-time football records In October 1934, 40 years after the first Washington State football game, Goodyear and 12 of the players from the 1894 team were honored guests at Washington State's homecoming football game. ==Publisher and politician== First issue of the Pullman Herald, dated November 3, 1888. Goodyear published the newspaper since 1901. Goodyear lived in Palouse, Washington in the early part of his career. In 1889, he purchased the Palouse News with partners P. H. Winton and Judge Norman Buck. Goodyear later became the newspaper's sole owner. He owned the newspaper and served as its publisher until 1898. In November 1894, he was nominated by Grover Cleveland as the postmaster at Palouse, and he served in that position during the second Cleveland administration. Goodyear later moved to Colfax, Washington. In 1898, he purchased the Colfax Commoner and became its publisher and editor.(\\"In May, 1898, William Goodyear, a well-known journalist of the county, who had for years edited a paper at Palouse, took charge of the Commoner, and he has continued at its head ever since.\\") While owned by Goodyear, the Commoner became known as \\"the leading democratic newspaper of eastern Washington\\". He was also active in Democratic Party politics in Colfax. When William Jennings Bryan visited the area during his 1900 presidential campaign, Goodyear introduced him as \\"the man whom the trusts hate, but the people love.\\" Goodyear was nominated as the party's candidate for the United States Congress in 1902 but declined the nomination. In 1908, he ran for Congress, and was the Democratic candidate in Washington's 3rd congressional district which included the entire eastern portion of the state. Goodyear was defeated by Miles Poindexter as Republicans swept the 1908 elections throughout the state. In 1901, Goodyear leased the plant of the Pacific Farmer's Union, the official publication of the Farmers' Union, and the Pullman Herald and managed those papers as well as the Colfax Commoner for a time. Goodyear sold the Commoner in 1911 and moved to Pullman, where he purchased the plant of the Pullman Herald. He was the publisher of the Pullman Herald until August 1935. In 1914, Goodyear was appointed as the receiver for the United States Land Office in Walla Walla, Washington. In 1918, he also became the chairman of the Pullman branch of the home service section of the Red Cross, providing relief to the homes of soldiers and sailors. During World War I, he was also the publicity director for the Liberty loan drives in Whitman County. Goodyear was outspoken on public policy matters and was an advocate of, among other things, the direct primary system and Prohibition at both the state and national level. ==Later years== At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Goodyear and his wife Neva were living in Pullman. Goodyear's occupation was listed in the census record as a newspaper publisher.Census entry for William and Neva Goodyear. Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

In January 1935, Goodyear's wife, Neva, died after breaking her shoulder in a fall while visiting their son, Trevor S. Goodyear, in Olympia, Washington. In May 1936, Goodyear sustained a scratch on his toe that developed into gangrene. He was hospitalized in Colfax for several weeks, and doctors eventually amputated his leg just below the knee. He was discharged from the hospital and died weeks later at his son's home in Olympia. ==Head coaching recordReferences * Category:1865 births Category:1936 deaths Category:19th- century American newspaper editors Category:19th-century players of American football Category:Washington State Cougars football coaches Category:Williams Ephs football players Category:Sportspeople from New Haven, Connecticut Category:People from Wellesley, Massachusetts Category:People from Pullman, Washington Category:Players of American football from Massachusetts Category:Washington (state) Democrats Category:People from Palouse, Washington ","title":"William Goodyear"},{"id":"20397146","text":"Robert Lee Nabors II (; born March 27, 1971) was the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from 2014 to 2016. He previously served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and several other senior roles in the Obama White House. ==Early life and education== He was born in Fort Dix, New Jersey and lived in Arizona, Maryland, Germany, Virginia, South Korea, Florida, Italy, Massachusetts in his youth. He received a B.A. from the University of Notre Dame in 1993 and an M.A. from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1996.Rob Nabors: Approps staffer sees beyond the numbers Libit, Daniel. Accessed November 25, 2008. ==Clinton Administration== Nabors first joined the Office of Management and Budget, straight out of graduate school, as a program examiner in 1996. Assigned to the Bureau's commerce branch, he was given responsibility for the decennial census, and while he was working on that task, he was recognized as a \\"budding wunderkind\\" by OMB Director Jack Lew, who promoted him to special assistant to the director in 1998. In 2000, he was further promoted to assistant director for administration and executive secretary. ==Congressional staff== Nabors joined the minority staff of the powerful House Appropriations Committee at the end of the Clinton Administration. Appropriations Chair Dave Obey promoted him to minority staff director in 2004. When the Democrats won the House in 2006, Nabors became majority staff director. \\"'He was just the best man for the job,' says Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, 'and he understands the House, he understands the committee, he understands the town, he understands the bureaucracy, and he doesn‚Äôt take any crap from anybody. His demeanor is very nice and very cool, but he doesn‚Äôt take any crap from people.'\\" Nabors said it was his job not just to \\"recite\\" budget numbers but to \\"own the information\\" and understand the human meanings behind the numbers. ==Obama Administration== Nabors' selection as Deputy Director of OMB, along with the selection of Peter Orszag as Director of OMB, was announced by President-Elect Barack Obama on November 25, 2008. In February 2010 Nabors became senior advisor to then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Jeff Liebman replaced Nabors as Acting Deputy Director at OMB. In January 2011 it was announced that Nabors had succeeded Phil Schiliro as the head of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Nabors' tenure as Director of Legislative Affairs was characterized by difficult and contentious negotiations with the new Republican House Majority in the 112th Congress, most vividly on display in the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. The stand-off eventually produced the compromise Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in the budget sequester in 2013. In November 2011, Nabors was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people. At the start of President Obama's second term, Nabors was named White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, alongside the new Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. In May 2014, in response to the Veterans Health Administration scandal, the President dispatched Nabors to oversee a review of practices at the Veterans Administration. Emails released by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs show that Nabors pressured the IG to downplay the link between extended waiting times and veteran deaths. On January 19, 2016 he became Director of Policy and Government Affairs covering the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific at the Gates Foundation. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Obama administration personnel Category:People from Fort Dix Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs officials Category:United States Office of Management and Budget officials Category:United States presidential advisors Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:White House Deputy Chiefs of Staff ","title":"Rob Nabors"},{"id":"20397157","text":"The Foundation for Excellence is a publicly supported, non-profit organization.

Eaton was the younger of two daughters. Lt.-Col. Eaton was killed in 1917, while directing the artillery assault at the battle of Vimy Ridge in France, when Evelyn Eaton was just 14. Evelyn's older sister, Helen Moira, would marry Sir John Lindsay Dashwood of the Dashwood Baronets. Educated at the Netherwood School in Rothesay, New Brunswick, Heathfield School in Ascot, England, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, Eaton rejected many of the social conventions of her time and class, giving birth out of wedlock to a daughter while at the Sorbonne. She wrote poetry from an early age, publishing the first, \\"The Interpreter\\", in 1923. Two novels written in 1938 and 1939 received little notice, but in 1940, the publication of Quietly My Captain Waits, a novel set in Acadia (now Nova Scotia) in the early days of French settlement (New France), brought her commercial success. She became an American citizen in 1945. A series of novels set in New France followed, as did a teaching appointment at Columbia University from 1949‚Äì1951, a Visiting Lecturership at Sweet Briar College, Virginia from 1951‚Äì1960, and a position as Writer in Residence with the Huntingdon Hartford Foundation in 1960 and 1962.Clara Thomas.

Fall-Winter 1995 As described in 1974 autobiography, The Trees and Fields Went the Other Way Eaton had always felt that she had some Native American or First Nations heritage, and in the 1950s she began to read books about Native American religions. A series of short stories published in The New Yorker, four more novels, a volume of poetry, and a Ballet-oratorio would grow out of Eaton's continuing promotion of what she believed were First Nations' spiritual practices. In 1966, the Evelyn Sybil Mary Eaton Collection, a repository for her books, manuscripts, and personal papers, was established in the Mugar Memorial Library at Boston University. ==Partial bibliography== *1923:The Interpreter *1928:Hours of Isis *1938:Summer Dust *1938:Pray to the Earth *1940:Quietly My Captain Waits *1942:Restless are the Sails *1943:Birds before Dawn *1943:The Sea is So Wide *1945:In What Torn Ship *1946:Journey to a War *1946:The Heart in Pilgrimage *1946:Every Month was May *1949:The North Star is Nearer *1950:Give Me Your Golden Hand *1952:By Just Exchange *1954:Flight *1955:The Small Hour *1959:I Saw My Mortal Sight *1965:The King is a Witch *1967:The Progression a Ballet-oratorio *1969:Go ask the River *1971:Love is Recognition *1974:The Trees and Fields Went the Other Way *1974:Snowy Earth Comes Gliding *1978:I Send a Voice *1982:The Shaman and the Medicine Wheel *1988:Joy Before Night, the Last Years of Evelyn Eaton A biography of Evelyn Eaton, written by her daughter Terry Eaton ==See also== *List of Canadian writers *List of American writers ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian novelists Category:20th-century Canadian poets Category:Canadian historical novelists Category:Canadian women poets Category:Canadian women short story writers Category:Canadian women novelists Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Sweet Briar College faculty Category:20th-century American novelists Category:American women poets Category:American women short story writers Category:Writers from Nova Scotia Category:Canadian people of English descent Category:20th-century American poets Category:American women novelists Category:20th-century Canadian women writers Category:People from Montreux Category:20th-century Canadian short story writers Category:Women historical novelists Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:Novelists from Virginia Category:Novelists from New York (state) ","title":"Evelyn Eaton"},{"id":"20397236","text":"On Arrival is the eighth studio album released by country music artist Dan Seals.

He then served as the head football coach at Morningside College in 1903 and at Washington State University in 1904 and 1905. He also coached basketball and baseball at Washington State. After retiring from football, Sweeley became a lawyer and judge in Idaho. ==BiographyEarly years=== Sweeley was born in Adel, Iowa in 1880.United States Draft Registration Card signed by Everett Marlin Sweeley, April 1942.

He played four years of football at Michigan from 1899 to 1902 at the end, fullback, and halfback positions, but he was best known as one of the game's premier punters and placekickers. Before enrolling at Michigan, Sweeley said he had never seen a college football game. In four seasons, he missed only one game, the result of what Sweeley called \\"a little row with a math professor.\\" While playing for Michigan, Sweeley set the college football record for the longest kick on record. In 1902, he kicked the football 86 yards before touching the ground. Sweeley also held \\"an enviable distinction unboasted by any other hero of the gridiron.\\" In four years punting for Michigan, he never had a single punt blocked. Sweeley was known for punts that were both high and long. He would reportedly tell his ends accurately where each punt was to go, \\"and by this concerted action Michigan gained many yards.\\" Sweeley was also \\"an expert place kicker,\\" scoring over 100 points for Michigan in this manner. A 1906 newspaper feature reported that his greatest talent was \\"the running punt trick,\\" a play in which Sweeley would run a ball \\"until he was hard pressed and then kick, often thus adding many yards to the ground gained.\\" In the 1902 Rose Bowl, Sweeley kicked four field goals and punted 21 times for a 38.9-yard average. A newspaper story in 1950 reported on Sweeley's kicking ability: \\"Sweeley, a truly great kicker in the days when the ball resembled a pumpkin rather than the tapered oblate spheroid now in use, introduced the spiral pant to Coast fans that memorable day [in the 1902 Rose Bowl]. His towering punts outdistanced the end-over-end kicks of the Indians by 20 yards.\\" ===Coach=== After graduating from Michigan, Sweeley went into coaching. He served as the head football coach at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa for a season in 1903 and then moved to Washington State University in Pullman, Washington for the 1904 and 1905 seasons.College Football Reference Washington State University Football RecordsMiami Herald Washington State University all-time football records His record at Washington State was 6‚Äì6. ===Later years=== After retiring from coaching, Sweeley moved to Twin Falls, Idaho where he worked as a lawyer.

In his draft registration card signed in April 1942, Sweeley listed his residence as Twin Falls, his employer as the County of Twin Falls, and his place of employment as the County Courthouse in Twin Falls. In 1952, Sweeley attended a reunion in California of the 1902 Rose Bowl team.

He played for the University of Michigan in 1904, 1905, and 1907, and was once \\"rated as the highest salaried amateur athlete in the business.\\" He later coached for Washington State University in 1908, St. Vincent's College (now known as Loyola Marymount University) in 1909, Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology) in 1913, and Occidental College in 1917. ==BiographyEarly years=== Rheinschild was born in Lawrence, Kansas in 1884 and raised in Los Angeles, California. In the 1890s, Rheinschild began playing football for the Boyle Heights Stars in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles. With Rheinschild playing fullback, the Stars won what the Los Angeles Times called \\"the 'scrub' championship of this city.\\" In 1900, Rheinschild enrolled at Los Angeles High School, where he became \\"a gridiron hero.\\" In 1901, he played tackle for the Los Angeles High School football team that tied Belmont High School for the state championship and defeated several college teams, including the University of Southern California (28‚Äì0), Pomona College (30‚Äì0), Occidental College (32‚Äì0), and St. Vincent's College (95‚Äì0). In 1902, the powerful Los Angeles High School team again defeated college teams, including USC, Occidental, Pomona and Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology). In his senior year in 1903, Rheinschild led Los Angeles High School to the California state championship, culminating in an 11‚Äì0 victory over Berkeley High School in the championship game. Rheinschild also organized the first track team at Los Angeles High School and was elected as the first captain of the track team. ===Bidding for Rheinschild's services=== Rheinschild and Michigan athletic director Charles A. Baird (pictured) denied that any money was paid to Rheinschild for playing football. Rheinschild was one of the most heavily recruited high school football players in the United States in 1904. USC coach Harvey Holmes recruited him strenuously, and Rheinschild later said that Holmes had offered him $75 a month for his services. At the time, USC was not a major football program, and Rheinschild reportedly wanted \\"nothing but the big league stuff.\\" The University of Wisconsin made an offer to Rheinschild which he said was $25 higher than USC had offered. Rheinschild recalled, \\"Twelve hundred looked big to me, but I wanted a winner. Wisconsin had been a joke for many seasons and I couldn't see it.\\" A former coach at Los Angeles High School, Shorty Roach, was a friend of Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost and a Michigan scout on the side. Roach encouraged Rheinschild to consider Michigan, which had not lost a game since 1900. A Wisconsin newspaper described the bidding contest between the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan for his services: > Walter Rheinschild, one of the best academic foot ball players in Southern > California, is the object of spirited bidding by foot ball managers at > Wisconsin and Michigan universities. Rheinschild was a star tackle on last > year's local high school team. He weighs 190 pounds. He declares openly that > Manager Baird of Michigan offered to pay all his expenses during the season > and finally offered him remunerative employment. Wisconsin, he says, offered > him all traveling expenses and $60 a month for two hours work a day at the > state capital. Rheinschild leaves tomorrow for the east. If Michigan equals > Wisconsin's offer he will go to Ann Arbor, if not, to Madison. At Kansas > City he expects to receive Baird's highest offer. Rheinschild was also visited by \\"a delegation\\" from Dartmouth College seeking \\"to do business with the California lad.\\" Rheinschild later told the Los Angeles Times that Dartmouth had offered him $2,200 for a year's work on the football team. Rheinschild settled on Fielding Yost's team at Michigan and later told the Times that \\"he swears by all that is swearable that he never received a cent from his Alma Mater for his athletic contributions.\\" Michigan's athletic director Charles A. Baird also denied making any offers of financial assistance to Rheinschild. However, when he rejected Dartmouth's offer of $2,200, eastern newspapers insinuated that Rheinschild had signed for \\"a Ty Cobb salary at Ann Arbor.\\" It was rumored that Rheinschild was receiving as much as $50,000 a year at Michigan, which if true would be as much as the U.S. President at the time. In a feature story on Rheinschild, the Los Angeles Times in 1914 summed up the bidding war for Rheinschild this way: > He used to be the great 'Rhiney,' and was known from coast to coast as one > of the most eminent gridiron warriors ever enticed under the Michigan > colors. At one time, 'Rhiney' was rated as the highest salaried amateur > athlete in the business, and he had standing offers from a number of those > colleges where football reigns, of sweet sums for his services. ===University of Michigan=== Official portrait of the 1907 Michigan football team‚ÄîRheinschild is second from the left in the back row. Rheinschild enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1904 and played for Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines football teams of 1904, 1905, and 1907. Rheinschild also threw the shot put for the Michigan Wolverines men's track and field team alongside world record holder Ralph Rose, and played catcher on the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. When Rheinschild established himself as a starter for Michigan in 1905, the Los Angeles Herald reported on his success as follows: > Walter Reinschild, formerly a star player of the Los Angeles high school > football team, is making good with the University of Michigan squad this > year. He played right tackle in the game against Vanderbilt university last > Saturday and made consistent gains when given the ball. According to reports > of the game Reinschild hit the opposing line low and hard and his work was a > factor in winning a decisive victory for 'Hurry Up' Yost's team. It looks as > though Reinschild would be a fixture on the team. In late 1905 and early 1906, charges of professionalism were leveled at the major college football programs, including Michigan, leading to calls for reform or even elimination of the sport from college campuses. In response to the controversy, the faculty at Michigan ruled Rheinschild and two other football players, Germany Schulz and Henry Schulte, academically ineligible. As a result, Rheinschild missed the 1906 season. Rheinschild's hometown newspaper, the Los Angeles Times described the action as follows: \\"In 1906 a wave of athletic purity swept over the country and the faculty refused to allow Rheinschild to play, for appearance sake. ... 'Rhiney' assisted Yost with the coaching and did some classroom work for a change.\\" Rheinschild returned to the football team in 1907. Playing at tackle and occasionally at fullback, he scored three touchdowns in Michigan's victory over Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) in October 1907. He also scored touchdowns against Wabash College and Ohio State in 1907.Michigan Alumnus, 1907 At the end of the 1907 season, Rheinschild was one of two Michigan players selected by Fielding H. Yost for the All-American team he selected for the North American Press Syndicate. He was also selected as an All-Western tackle by Walter Eckersall, who wrote that Rheinschild \\"has no equal at tackle.\\" Eckersall continued: > Rheinschild of Michigan played close to the top this year, and his work in > the Pennsylvania game would have given him even without his work in the > other games. It was the best of any tackle on the field, and clearly > indicated his caliber. One of his points is getting down the field under > kicks. He often beat his ends down, and was sure and deadly in his tackle. > He was not made use of sufficiently in offense to get his value in that > respect. He was able to lunge from his position with extreme rapidity, to > assist either the offense or defense. His play was, if anything less showy > than in former years, but fully as effective, and this was clearly > demonstrated all year. Rheinschild graduated from the University of Michigan in 1908 with a law degree. ===Coaching career=== After receiving his law degree, Rheinschild went to London where he competed for the Illinois Athletic Club in the 1908 Summer Olympics. After the Olympics, Rheinschild traveled to Paris, where he claimed to have \\"taught the 'frog-eaters' how to box for a few months.\\" Upon returning to the United States, he got a job \\"escorting a flock of prisoners across the continent to Mare Island\\" in Northern California. In the fall of 1908, Rheinschild served as head football coach for the Washington State University Cougars in Pullman, Washington. In his first and only season as coach at Washington State, his football team compiled a record of 4 wins, 0 losses, and 2 ties.College Football Reference Washington State University Football Records Miami Herald Washington State University all-time football recordsWashington State Cougars coaching records When the University of Washington claimed to be the football champions of the Northwest, Rheinschild, whose team played Washington to a tie, disputed the claim and challenged them to a rematch in Pullman. Rheinschild added, \\"Can Washington lay claim to the championship over W.S.C. when we played them to a standstill on their own grounds, held them to a 6 to 6 score and were outplaying them in the last 10 minutes of the game, so that nothing but the expiration of time prevented us from scoring a touchdown?\\" Image of Rheinschild from 1909 newspaper article announcing his hiring by St. Vincent's College In 1909, Rheinschild returned to Los Angeles to become head football coach at St. Vincent's College (now known as Loyola Marymount University). He led St. Vincent's to an undefeated season and the football championship of Southern California in his one year as head coach. The Los Angeles Times praised Rheinschild's efforts in turning the St. Vincent's team into champions: > Rheinschild has accomplished wonders with a squad which at the outset of the > season appeared to be mediocre to an unusual degree. The Saints' athletic > authorities are more than pleased with the success of 'Rheiny.' They > expected the coach to clean up the Saint athletics and get a start for next > year. 'Rheiny' did considerably more. He developed the strongest team the > Saints ever had. And the eleven played clean ball too. In 1910, St. Vincent's College withdrew from participation in Southern California intercollegiate athletics, opting to confine athletics to the Catholic student body. In 1913, Rheinschild was hired as the football coach at Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology) in Pasadena, California, where he was paid $40 per game‚Äîthe largest salary ever paid to a football coach in Southern California. He continued coaching in the 1910s as the football coach of the Los Angeles Athletic Club. In 1915, Rheinschild was offered coaching positions at both the University of Michigan and the University of Washington. In April 1916 Rheinschild was endorsed to served as the football coach at Occidental College, replacing Joseph Pipal. Occidental football records show that Fox Stanton served as the team's head coach in 1916. Rheinschild coached at Occidental during the 1917 season. On Christmas Day 1917, Rheinschild coached and played for a college all-star football team in a match against athletes from the San Pedro Submarine Base. ===Family, legal and business careers=== Rheinschild was married in February 1909 to Enid Daniels at the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Los Angeles; following the ceremony, they couple was given a box at the Orpheum Theatre where a spot light was thrown on them between acts as \\"the orchestra struck up a wedding march\\" for the embarrassed couple. After stepping down as the coach at St. Vincent's College in 1910, Rheinschild established a law practice in the Security Building, then the tallest building in Los Angeles, located in the heart of the city's Spring Street Financial District. He continued with his legal practice between and after his stints as a football coach. The old \\"Orpheum Theater\\" where Rheinschild and his bride were in the spotlight in 1909. In April 1919, Rheinschild was tried and found not guilty of complicity in an automobile theft; Rheinschild had been accused of hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"tears of mortification\\" came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and \\"his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw her arms around his neck and tenderly kissed him.\\" Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest. As of 1934, Rheinschild was the president of Corona Oil Company, Ltd., which was then drilling for oil in \\"the old Rancho LaSierra\\" in Riverside County, California. In 1942, Rheinschild was a prosecution witness against Bugsy Siegel on charges of murdering Harry \\"Big Greenie\\" Greenberg; Rheinschild testified he had seen Siegel near Greenberg's house on many occasions in the weeks prior to the murder. ==Head coaching recordReferences== Category:1884 births Category:1960 deaths Category:American football tackles Category:Baseball catchers Category:Caltech Beavers football coaches Category:Michigan Wolverines baseball players Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Michigan Wolverines men's track and field athletes Category:Loyola Lions football coaches Category:Occidental Tigers football coaches Category:Washington State Cougars football coaches Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Lawrence, Kansas Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Players of American football from California ","title":"Walter Rheinschild"},{"id":"20397275","text":"Cond√© Nast Traveller is published by Cond√© Nast Publications Ltd, from Vogue House in Hanover Square, Mayfair, London.

Analytic dissection is a tool for determining whether a work accused of copyright infringement is substantially similar to a copyright-protected work. In analytic dissection, unprotectable elements of a work are dissected out and discarded before making any comparison of the two works. These unprotectable components include idea (as contrasted with expression), sc√®nes √† faire (conventional elements typical of a genre), material in the public domain, and functional aspects. As the Ninth Circuit explained in the 1988 Data East case, that such elements are common to two works does not create substantial similarity. Rather, infringing similarity must be based on the similarity of what remains after the unprotectable elements are dissected out.See Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc., 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988) (video game case). Subsequently, in Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.,982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992). the Second Circuit applied this conceptual tool in determining whether two computer programs were substantially similar, under the name of the \\"Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison\\" test. As the Tenth Circuit concisely explained this test in Gates Rubber v. Bando Chemical Industries: > [A] court should dissect the program according to its varying levels of > generality as provided in the abstractions test. Second, poised with this > framework, the court should examine each level of abstraction in order to > filter out those elements of the program that are unprotectable. Filtration > should eliminate from comparison the unprotectable elements of ideas, > processes, facts, public domain information, merger material, sc√®nes √† faire > material, and other unprotectable elements suggested by the particular facts > of the program under examination. Third, the court should then compare the > remaining protectable elements with the allegedly infringing program to > determine whether the defendants have misappropriated substantial elements > of the plaintiff's program.Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, > Ltd., 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993). This legal test has generally \\"been applied in subsequent [copyright law] decisions, to the extent that it is recognised in the USA, and elsewhere, as the accepted standard.\\" 30 (2000) (collecting authorities). ==Parallels in patent law== A conceptually similar approach has been applied at times in US, UK, and European patent law. In Neilson v. Harford, the Exchequer adopted a method of analyzing the patent-eligibility of inventions based on a natural principle or phenomenon of nature, in which the principle is treated as if part of the prior art and the remainder of the invention (i.e., the mechanical implementation of the principle) is evaluated for patentability under the usual tests (novelty, etc.). The US Supreme Court followed this approach in O'Reilly v. Morse and subsequent decisions including Parker v. Flook and Mayo v. Prometheus. A similar type of analysis of obviousness or inventive level has been used under the name of the \\"point of novelty\\" test, which is suggested by the use of a Jepson claim. == References == Category:United States copyright law ","title":"Analytic dissection"},{"id":"20397311","text":"Woods Memorial Presbyterian Church was established in 1912 in Severna Park, Maryland.

In 1986, Raymond Coke, minister of Meadowbrook Church, after a visit to Woods, proposed that the two churches develop a joint mission relationship, starting with an exchange of pulpits for a month, in 1987. After further familiarization visits by members of both congregations, agreements were reached on Woods support of the catering and cooking school run by Meadowbrook. Later on other support agreements were reached involving the elementary schools being run by Meadowbrook. Woods also provided some equipment for the Meadowbrook dental clinic. There were reciprocal visits of elders of the two churches and a visit to Woods by the Meadowbrook Youth Choir in the spring 1988.

It has also been called Santi Vito, Modesto e Crescenzia (Saints Vito, Modesto and Crescenzia). It is located , adjacent to the Servian Wall, near the former Monastery of the Viperesche. ==History== This area was previously part of the Macellum LiviaeA macellum is an ancient Roman indoor market., and the market included a inside a large basilica building, later a church, putative identified as the Basilica Sicinium (now identified with the church of Santa Maria Maggiore) mentioned by the historian Ammianus Marcellinus in the 4th century. After the persecutions of Domitian, the area was called the Macello Martyrum or \\"marketplace of the martyrs\\". A church, titled San Vito in Macello Martyrum was first recorded in the Liber Pontificalis for the reign of Pope Leo III (795‚Äì816). The church was dedicated to St. Vitus, a 4th-century martyr in Sicily. He became very popular during the Middle Ages as the patron saint of those suffering from epilepsy, and was venerated as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In England and other countries his name was mutated into \\"Guy\\" (as in Guy Fawkes), which in Italian became Guido. The church was described as a diaconia, a center for the Church's charitable activities and received donations from Pope Leo. This implies that it was founded when there was still a local residential population to be served from the time of its founding, likely in the 6th century, as the Esquiline began to lose its population about that time. Possibly in line with its ancient orientation, it became a titular church for a Cardinal Deacon in 1088. The first cardinal to receive this title was Leo of Ostia, a Benedictine monk. Facade of church on Via Carlo Alberto In that same period a legend describing the martyrdom of St. Vitus became popular. This legend associated him with two other martyrs called Modestus and Crescentia who were identified as a married couple, his childhood tutor and nursemaid. As a result, the church was renamed San Vitale e Modesto in Macello Martyrum, which was also the name of the cardinalate. Later in the Middle Ages the cardinalate was renamed Santi Vitale, Modesto e Crescentia, but the church came to be called simply Santi Vito e Modesto, and the Macello Martyrum was forgotten.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); pages 314-315. By the 15th century the church had fallen into ruins. One source mentions the church was always suspect due to links to heresy under Pope Damasus I in the 4th century. It was rebuilt a parish church by 1474-1477 by Pope Sixtus IV near the original site. The church has housed multiple orders: in the 15th century, it was linked to nuns under the order of St Bernard. In 1685, it was entrusted to the Cistercian monks. They established a small monastery adjacent to the church, which served as the residence of the Procurator General of the Order. Later it passed on to other clerical orders. In 1834, the church had a major restoration under the architect Pietro Camporese il Giovane, and in 1900 by Alfredo Ricci who added the modern facade. According to Mas Latrie, this deaconry became a title from 1477 until 1480, when it was returned to its older rank as a Cardinal-Deaconry. and again in 1565 when Pope Pius IV (1559‚Äì1565) created 23 new cardinals. It underwent a series of reconstructions in the following centuries. In the 19th century, it was occupied by a Polish order, known for ministering to the rabid. Pope Sixtus V listed it among the deaconries in his apostolic constitution Religiosa. The interior has frescoes of the Madonna, child, and Saints attributed to Antoniazzo Romano. It also has 19th-century frescoes depicting the Madonna offering the Rosary to Saints Dominic and Catherine of Siena. The main altar has a painting by Pasqualino Marini. The current Cardinal Deacon is Giuseppe Bertello, appointed in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.David M.

He was living in Philadelphia when he invented and first produced the pianino or cottage pianoforte ‚Äì the \\"portable grand\\" as he then called it ‚Äì which he patented in 1800. Thomas Jefferson bought one, of 5¬Ω octaves, for $264.Charles H. Kaufman, Music in New Jersey, 1655‚Äì1860: a study of musical activity and musicians in New Jersey from its first settlement to the Civil War (1981), p. 161; Google Books. There had been upright grand pianos as well as upright harpsichords, the horizontal instrument being turned up on its wider end and a keyboard and action adapted to it. William Southwell, an Irish piano-maker, had in 1798 tried a similar experiment with a square piano, to be repeated in later years by William Frederick Collard of London; but Hawkins was the first to make a piano, or pianino, with the strings descending to the floor, the keyboard being raised. His instrument was in a complete iron frame, independent of the case; and in this frame, strengthened by a system of iron resistance rods combined with an iron upper bridge, his sound-board was entirely suspended. An apparatus for tuning by mechanical screws regulated the tension of the strings, which were of equal length throughout. The action, in metal supports, anticipated Robert Wornum's in the checking, and later ideas in a contrivance for repetition. This bundle of inventions was brought to London and exhibited by Hawkins himself; but the instrument was poor in tone. ==Other inventions, proposals and works== *Patented (1802) an improved physiognotrace, a device by which one could quickly produce a silhouette portrait (i.e. a paper cut-out profile).\\"Explanation of Mr. Jn\\\\o I.

Return to Mysterious Island II starts with the crash of the helicopter that attempted the rescue of Mina. She survives the crash, but is still on the island. An unknown disease suddenly begins to attack plants, then animals. Mina searches the island, and discovers an external source of pollution. It appears that the only way to save the island is to turn the shield back on, which would prevent her from returning to civilization, like Captain Nemo. == Development == On November 25, 2008 Micro√Øds announced that a sequel to Return to Mysterious Island had been in development by Kheops Studio since April 2008. On 14 August an email was sent to the Micro√Øds mailing list noting that the game had been released for download in English and French for PC and iPhone. The game website also displays the Cryo Interactive logo, a company which Micro√Øds acquired in 2008, from the publisher of the original Return to Mysterious Island, The Adventure Company.

It has a mass around 13 Jupiter masses and a radius around 46% larger than Jupiter's. It orbits at 9 AU from Beta Pictoris (close to the plane of the debris disk orbiting the star) with a low eccentricity and a period of 20‚Äì21 years. ==CharacteristicsMass, radius and temperature=== Beta Pictoris b is a super-Jupiter, an exoplanet that has a radius and mass greater than that of the planet Jupiter. It has a temperature of , most likely due to its dusty atmosphere and mass (normally it would be much colder). It has a mass of between 9 and 13 Jupiter masses (), and a radius of 1.46 . In 2018, a study directly measured the astrometric perturbation of Beta Pictoris by Beta Pictoris b, one of the first examples of an exoplanet being measured directly by its astrometric perturbation. Its mass was directly measured as . ===Host star=== The planet orbits an (A-type) star named Beta Pictoris. The star has a mass of 1.75 solar masses () and a radius of 1.8 solar radii (). It has a surface temperature of 8056 K and is 12 million years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. It is slightly metal-rich, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of 0.06, or 112% of that found in the Sun. Its luminosity () is 8.7 times that of the Sun. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 3. Therefore, it can be seen with the naked eye. ===Orbit=== Beta Pictoris b orbits its host star every 21 years at a distance of 9.2 AU (about the same as Saturn's distance, which is about 9.55 AU). It receives 11% of the amount of sunlight that Earth does from the Sun.http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_beta_Pic_b.png ==Planetary rotation== In 2014, the rotation period of Beta Pictoris b was calculated from the broadening of its carbon monoxide infrared absorption line. This makes it, , the first extrasolar planet to have its rotation rate measured. With a rotation period of 8.1 hours, it is the fastest-spinning planet known. Its rotation period is faster than that of Jupiter, which has a rotation period of around 10 hours. The rotation axis of the planet is well aligned to the axis of the parent star and debris disk, with misalignment measured to be 3 degrees in 2020. ==Discovery== The planet was discovered on November 18, 2008 by Anne-Marie Lagrange et al., using the NACO instrument on the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in northern Chile. This planet was discovered using the direct imaging technique, using reference star differential imaging. The discovery image was taken in 2003, but the planet was not detected when the data were first reduced. A re-reduction of the data in 2008 using modern image processing tools revealed the faint point source now known to be a planet. ===Further studies=== Follow-up observations performed in late 2009 and early 2010 using the same instrument recovered and confirmed the planet, but on the opposite side of the star. These findings were published in the journal Science and represented the closest orbiting planet to its star ever imaged. Observations performed in late 2010 and early 2011 allowed scientists to establish an inclination angle of the planet's orbit of 88.5 degrees, nearly edge-on. The location of the planet was found to be approximately 3.5 to 4 degrees tilted from the main disk in this system, indicating that the planet is aligned with the warped inner disk in the Beta Pictoris system. The first study of the spectral energy distribution of the planet was published in July 2013. This study shows detections at 1.265, 1.66, 2.18, 3.80, 4.05 and 4.78 ¬µm demonstrating that the planet has a very dusty and/or cloudy atmosphere. The SED is consistent with that of an early L dwarf, but with a lower surface gravity. The effective temperature is constrained to and the surface gravity to log g = . A second study, published in September 2013, provided a new detection at 3.1 ¬µm obtained at the Gemini Observatory along with a reanalysis of previous data. They found the planet to be overluminous in the mid-infrared 3.1 ¬µm band compared to models of early L dwarfs. Models incorporating small dust particles and thick clouds provided the best fit to the SED. The effective temperature is constrained to and the surface gravity to log g = . This fit corresponds to a planet radius of 1.65 times that of Jupiter, arguing that Beta Pictoris b may be younger than its host star (finished forming at 5 Ma). In 2015, a short video was made from direct images of Beta Pictoris b taken by the Gemini Planet Imager over the course of about two years showing a time-lapse of the planet orbiting around its parent star. It may have been responsible for a transit-like event observed in 1981. In 2018, the PicSat cubesat was launched in a mission to image the planet Beta Pictoris b transiting its host star Beta Pictoris. ==Gallery== Stunning Exoplanet Time-lapse Beta Pictoris b.tifBeta Pictoris b time-lapse.

It consists of The Irish Fish Producers Organization Ltd (IFPO), The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation Ltd.(IS&WFPO;), and The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation Ltd (KFO). Currently, the FIF represents over 90% of the Irish fishing fleet. The mission statement of the FIF is \\"to provide a unified voice for the Irish Fishing Industry and to provide an active input into all policy making decisions both nationally and internationally.\\" The group participates in extensive lobbying on behalf of the livelihood of its members and their professions, as well as organizes demonstrations and other national events to benefit the national industry. ==History== The FIF was founded in 2006 in response to the ever waning fishing industry in Ireland due to imports of cheaper fish from elsewhere on the European continent. The establishment of the organization was a formalization of already tight coalitions between the smaller member organizations. It was initially chaired by the then CEO of The Irish Fish Producers Organization, Lorc√°n √ì Cinn√©ide. ==Leadership== The FIF‚Äôs leadership structure is a Board of Chief Executives from the constituent organizations: * Francis O'Donnell (CEO of The Irish Fish Producers Organization) * Eibhl√≠n O'Sullivan (CEO of The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation Ltd.) * Se√°n O'Donoghue (CEO of The Killybegs Fishermen‚Äôs Organization Ltd.) * the remaining 6 Directors are made up of two representatives of the constituent organisations. The position of Chairman of the Board changes each year, rotating between the CEOs of the three constituent fish producing organizations. As of 1 January 2014 the position is held by Se√°n O'Donoghue of the KFO. ==Action== The FIF have been responsible for a number of demonstrations on behalf of the Irish Fishing Industry since its inception. Some of these actions include: * 5 June 2008 - to protest the import of cheap fish from outside Ireland and the resulting low prices paid to domestic fishermen for their catch, FIF demonstrators blocked the cargo terminal at Cork Airport. * 14 July 2008 - FIF representatives lobbied for the immediate implementation of an emergency economic aid package for the domestic fishing industry. The package was agreed on the next day during a meeting of EU Fisheries Ministers in Brussels on 15 July. The package was upwards of ‚Ç¨600 million. * 21 July 2008 ‚Äì Coinciding with the visit of President Nicolas Sarkozy, and to protest the fact that Ireland has 23% of the fishing waters in Europe but is only allowed a 4% international trade quota, FIF demonstrators distributed surplus catch of 1.5 tons of free fish on the O'Connell Bridge. Over 200 fishermen from around the country took part. The protest moved on to Government Buildings later in the day, and was supported by MEP Kathy Sinnott, Sinn F√©in TD Arthur Morgan, and former unsuccessful (Labour Party/Socialist Workers Party/Independent) election candidate and Gombeen man, Michael O'Sullivan. ==Treaty of Lisbon== The FIF claims to have played a vital role in the national veto of the Treaty of Lisbon, an EU document seeking to consolidate leadership and increase functionality of international trade within the EU. By Irish constitutional law, such a motion had to be voted on in a public referendum. The FIF took a strong stance against the treaty, claiming that its trade provisions for the fish market would be unhealthy for the already struggling Irish industry. A series of actions before and after the Lisbon vote on 12 June (to which the Irish delivered a very sound ‚Äúno‚Äù) occurred, including fish dumps, harbor blocking, boat tie ups, and numerous other acts. However, when protocols were agreed with the other EU states, on issues such as neutrality, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed by the people with a 67% majority. ==See also== *European Union *Economy of the Republic of Ireland ==References== Category:Fishing in Ireland Category:Fishing trade associations Category:2006 establishments in Ireland Category:Organizations established in 2006 Category:Organisations based in the Republic of Ireland Category:Economy of the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Federation of Irish Fishermen"},{"id":"20398126","text":"The list of the coins included are for those issued by the Royal Dutch Mint from 1970 to 2001 10 Gulden * 1970 .720 silver 38 mm. 25th year of the end of the Second World War and liberation, 1945‚Äì1970 * 1973 .720 silver 38 mm. 25th year of reign, Queen Juliana, 1948‚Äì1973 * 1994 .925 silver 33 mm. 50th anniversary of the BE NE LUX trade accord, 1944‚Äì1994 * 1995 .925 silver 33 mm. 350th anniversary, death of Hugo the Great, 1583‚Äì1645 * 1996 .925 silver 33 mm.

The events are held over the course of a weekend and although various classes of past and present Formula Fords are present, the high point for many is the championship in which young but skilled drivers from Ford competitions in Europe and beyond race against one another. Often it is a rare chance to compare the skills of drivers who take part in different Ford competitions across the world. Many winners of the festival have gone on to enjoy professional careers in various branches of motorsport - including fourteen who have raced in Formula One. The event is administered by the British Racing and Sports Car Club. ==HistoryInception=== The inaugural season in 1972 took place at Snetterton, where the festival was held until 1975. It then moved to Brands Hatch where it has stayed to date. ===The Kent years=== The Kent engine was the lead engine in early Formula Ford, and so from the first festival in 1972 until the Zetec was introduced in 1993. ===The Zetec years=== The Zetec engine was the leading engine from 1993 until the Duratec took over in 2006. ===The Duratec engine=== The 1600 c.c. Duratec engine is currently used in the leading races although the Zetec and Kent engines are still used in junior and classic classes of racing. ===Loss of prominence=== For many years the festival was the highlight of the Formula Ford season. Entries of several hundred cars from all over the Formula Ford world were common into the 1990s, with racers competing in knockout heats to decide the grid for a grand final. Entries have been declining and recent Festivals have struggled to attract more than 40-50 cars, enough for two heats and a final. Support races from other classes e.g. Caterham, Club F3 and Historic Sports 2000 have also been included in the program. This is because although the event still has the atmosphere of past years its position as a rite of passage for young drivers has largely been usurped by other junior formulae and karting. More \\"historic\\" FF1600 cars have been turning up for the supporting races than contemporary Zetecs, however in 2006 the Festival saw the Duratec engine for the first time thereby having a final for all 3 marques at one meeting for the first time. The Walter Hayes Trophy now recognises the continuing interest in 1600cc 'Kent' Formula Ford and attracted over 150 entries in 2006, including several drivers more commonly seen in much more senior formulae, including current two-time Nippon Telegraph and Telephone IndyCar Series champion Josef Newgarden, who won the 2008 Kent class, the most recent prominent champion to have raced in this festival. ==Winners== Below is a list of overall festival winners. Since 1993, a secondary festival was run in alongside for older specification cars running the Ford Kent engine. Since 2009, a third event has also been held for cars using the Ford Zetec engine. * denotes later raced in Formula One {  !rowspan=2 Year !rowspan=2 Circuit !colspan=3 Overall Festival Winner !colspan=2 Kent Festival !colspan=2 Zetec Festival - !Driver !Chassis !Engine !Driver !Chassis !Driver !Chassis - ! 1972  rowspan=4Snetterton  Ian Taylor  Dulon LD9  rowspan=21 Ford Kent engine  rowspan=21 colspan=2 align=centerNot Held  rowspan=37 colspan=2 align=centerNot Held - ! 1973  Donald Macleod  Van Diemen FA73 - ! 1974  Richard Morgan  Crossle 25F - ! 1975  Geoff Lees *  Royale RP21 - ! 1976  rowspan=37 Brands Hatch  Derek Daly *  Hawke DL17 - ! 1977  Chico Serra *  Van Diemen RF77 - ! 1978  Michael Roe  Van Diemen RF78 - ! 1979  Donald Macleod  Sark 1 - ! 1980  Roberto Moreno *  Van Diemen RF80 - ! 1981  Tommy Byrne *  Van Diemen RF81 - ! 1982  Julian Bailey *  Lola T640E - ! 1983  Andrew Gilbert-Scott  Reynard 83F - ! 1984  Gerrit van Kouwen  Lola T644E - ! 1985  Johnny Herbert *  Quest FF85 - ! 1986  Roland Ratzenberger *  Van Diemen RF86 - ! 1987  Eddie Irvine *  Van Diemen RF87 - ! 1988  Vincenzo Sospiri *  Van Diemen RF88 - ! 1989  Niko Palhares  Van Diemen RF89 - ! 1990  Dave Coyne  Swift FB90 - ! 1991  Marc Goossens  Van Diemen RF91 - ! 1992  Jan Magnussen *  Van Diemen RF92 - ! 1993  Russell Ingall  Van Diemen RF93  rowspan=13Ford Zetec engine  Andrew MacAuley  Reynard 92FF - ! 1994  Jason Watt  Vector TF94  Gavin Wills  Swift SC92F - ! 1995  Kevin McGarrity  Van Diemen RF95  Topi Serjala  Swift SC95F - ! 1996  Mark Webber *  Van Diemen RF96  Mark Marchant  Jamun M96 - ! 1997  Jacky van der Ende  Van Diemen RF97  rowspan=5 colspan=2 align=centerNot Held - ! 1998  Jenson Button *  Mygale SJ98 - ! 1999  Ricardo van der Ende  Van Diemen RF99 - ! 2000  Anthony Davidson *  Mygale SJ00 - ! 2001  Alan van der Merwe  Mygale SJ01 - ! 2002  Jan Heylen  Van Diemen RF02  Dave Fricker  Reynard 89FF - ! 2003  Joey Foster  Van Diemen RF03  Matthew Gilmore  Van Diemen RF92 - ! 2004  Dan Clarke  Van Diemen RF04  Joey Foster  Reynard 89FF - ! 2005  Duncan Tappy  Mygale SJ04  Gavin Wills  Van Diemen RF00 - ! 2006  Richard Tannahill  Van Diemen RF06  rowspan=7 Ford Duratec engine  Noel Dunne  Van Diemen RF92 - ! 2007  Nick Tandy  Ray GRS07  Keith Dempsey  Ray GRS07 - ! 2008  Wayne Boyd  Mygale SJ08  Josef Newgarden  Ray GRS08 - ! 2009  Chrissy Palmer  Mygale SJ09  Rory Butcher  Van Diemen RF90  Neil Tofts  Mygale SJ04 - ! 2010  Dennis Lind  Van Diemen LA08  Neville Smyth  Ray GRS09  Julian Hoskins  Vector TF93 - ! 2011  Scott Malvern  Mygale SJ10  Ivor McCullough  Van Diemen RF00  Neil Tofts  Mygale SJ04 - ! 2012  Antti Buri  Mygale SJ11  Ivor McCullough  Van Diemen RF00  Xavier Michel  Van Diemen - !rowspan=2 Year !rowspan=2 Circuit !colspan=3 Overall Festival Winner - Kent !colspan=2 Duratec Festival !colspan=2 Zetec Festival - !Driver !Chassis !Engine Builder !Driver !Chassis !Driver !Chassis - ! 2013  Brands Hatch  Niall Murray  Van Diemen RF99  MCP  Bart van Os  Mygale SJ10  Julian Hoskins  Vector TF93 - !rowspan=2 Year !rowspan=2 Circuit !colspan=3 Overall Festival Winner - Kent !colspan=4 Duratec-Zetec Festival - !Driver !Chassis !Engine Builder !colspan=2Driver !colspan=2Chassis - ! 2014  Brands Hatch  James Raven  Ray GR13/14  Bold colspan=2 Thomas Craincourt colspan=2 Mygale Duratec - !rowspan=2 Year !rowspan=2 Circuit !colspan=3 Overall Festival Winner - Kent !colspan=2 Pre-1990 Winner !colspan=2 Pre-1982 Winner - !Driver !Chassis !Engine Builder !Driver !Chassis !Driver !Chassis - ! 2015 rowspan=5 Brands Hatch  Wayne Boyd  Van Diemen MS13K  Bold  Matthew Cowley  Reynard FF88  Stuart Kestenbaum  Van Diemen RF79 - ! 2016  Niall Murray  Van Diemen RF99  MCP  Job van Uitert  Van Diemen RF89 - ! 2017  Joey Foster  Ray GR08  Bold - ! 2018  Joshua Smith  Van Diemen JL13  Barnett - ! 2019  Jonathan Browne  Ray GR19   Henry Chart  Jamun T2 } ==See also== *Formula Ford *Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit *Brands Hatch ==References * BRSCC Homepage * Facebook Group to get 50,000 fans to the Festival ==Sources== *BRSCC Calendar * Motor Sport Vision (Owners of Brands Hatch) * Johnny Herbert *Club Formula Ford * Historics Category:Formula Ford Category:Formula races ","title":"Formula Ford Festival"},{"id":"20398149","text":"The Restaurant Group plc is a British chain of restaurants and public houses.

In the late 1980s, the company bought the Mexican foodchain Chi Chi's and renamed it Chiquito. Then, in 1995, it opened its first Frankie & Benny's in Leicester. In January 2004, the company changed its name to The Restaurant Group plc. In February 2004, it made an unsuccessful bid for Ask Central plc, and in 2006, it bought back the Deep Pan Pizza chain, which it had previously sold to the management. In 2016, the company announced it was closing 33 restaurants due to falling sales and profits. In 2018, The Restaurant Group purchased noodle chain Wagamama for ¬£559m, to diversify its portfolio. In May 2018, the Brunning & Price division purchased the Ribble Valley Inns, a collection of restaurant and real ale pubs in the north of England, from the Northcote Group for an undisclosed sum; and in August 2018, the division purchased the 11-strong portfolio of Food & Fuel Pubs, which included two Coco Momo wine bars, for ¬£15.4 million. On 3 June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, The Restaurant Group told employees a \\"large number\\" of its outlets would not reopen after lockdown; up to 120 restaurants, mainly Frankie & Benny's, were set to close permanently, with the loss of between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs. On 8 June, The Restaurant Group said it was in discussions with its landlords about potential restructuring options, and three days later announced it had entered a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) and planned to cut 125 sites. ==Operations== Newport As of December 2019, The Restaurant Group plc operated over 650 restaurants and pub restaurants throughout the UK. It also operates a multi‚Äêbrand Concessions business which trades principally in UK airports. In addition, the Wagamama business had 5 restaurants in the US and over 50 franchise restaurants operating across a number of territories. ===Subsidiaries=== *Brunning & Price *Chiquito *Coast to Coast *Frankie & Benny's *Garfunkel's *Wagamama ==See also== * List of companies based in London ==References * Category:British companies established in 1987 Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Restaurants established in 1987 Category:Restaurant groups in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Restaurant Group"},{"id":"20398156","text":"Map of Saint John, New Brunswick, 1894 Thomas Leavitt (1795-1850) was an early president of the Bank of New Brunswick in his native Saint John, New Brunswick. Leavitt was also a diplomat, politician and powerful Canadian businessman with interests in the shipping industry. Thomas Leavitt was the descendant of early New Hampshire settlers.Thomas Leavitt's father Jonathan was born in 1746 in Brentwood, New Hampshire, the son of John Leavitt and his wife Mary Tilton. The immigrant English ancestor was Thomas Leavitt, an early farmer and settler of Exeter, New Hampshire and then Hampton. His father Jonathan Leavitt (1746-1811) was a mariner who arrived in New Brunswick from New Hampshire in 1764.Transcript of evidence given by Jonathan Leavitt in the case of Thomas Nokes versus William Hazen and James White, August 31, 1792, University of New Brunswick, lib.unb.ca Capt. Jonathan Leavitt's wife was Hephzibah (Peabody) Leavitt, daughter of Capt. Francis Peabody, a Massachusetts native who came north following the French and Indian War to settle lands he was granted to form a township in New Brunswick.Captain Francis Peabody and the Maugerville Colony, The English on the River St. John, nb.nbnet.ca Capt. Leavitt arrived in New Brunswick in August 1762 aboard ship from Newburyport, Massachusetts, with father-in-law Peabody, as well as James Simmons and James White, for whom he worked as a mariner at the firm of shipowners Simmons, Hazen & White, whose partners he was related to by marriage. (Leavitt and James Simmons and James White had married daughters of Francis Peabody).Foot-prints, Or, Early Events in History of New Brunswick, Joseph Wilson Lawrence, J. & A. McMillan, Saint John, N.B., 1883 Jonathan Leavitt had eight sons, including Thomas Leavitt, and two daughters. The Leavitt family later joined their relations in the shipping business, becoming shipowners, mariners and prominent merchants in Saint John, which following the Revolutionary War had a substantial American Loyalist population. By 1774, mariner Leavitt was actively engaged in shipbuilding, joining forces that year with brother-in-law Samuel Peabody to order construction of one of the earliest schooners built in New Brunswick, the Menaguashe.Wooden Ships and Iron Men: The Story of the Square-Rigged Merchant Marine of British North America, Frederick William Wallace, Charles E. Lauriat Co., Boston, 1937 Early in his career, mariner Leavitt grew discouraged with his prospects, fearing that New Brunswick would never support a shipping industry like that of Boston or Halifax, Nova Scotia. Jonathan Leavitt and his brother Daniel mulled over moving elsewhere where \\"there was a larger population and more business\\", reported The New Brunswick Magazine. Leavitt's brother-in-law and sometime employer James White intervened, telling the two brothers: \\"Don't be discouraged, boys, keep up a good heart! Why ships will come here from England yet!\\"The New Brunswick Magazine, Vol. I, July-December 1898, William Kilby Reynolds, St. John, New Brunswick, 1898 The industry that Jonathan Leavitt pioneered later blossomed, especially after the influx of Loyalists following the Revolutionary War. Capt. Jonathan Leavitt and his brother Capt. Daniel Leavitt were among those who piloted into Saint John's harbor the fleet of vessels carrying thousands of American Loyalists from New York City in 1784. The influx of Loyalists stoked the Saint John economy: it would later rank fourth among shipbuilding cities of the British Empire, earning it the sobriquet of \\"the Liverpool of North America\\". Leavitt and his family became recipients of that boom. At his death in 1811, former ship captain Jonathan Leavitt left a large estate including properties scattered across Saint John and a large tract on the Miramichi River. Leavitt's son Thomas took over the reins of the family business. He was admitted a merchant freeman of Saint John in 1817, and subsequently played a major role in business affairs of New Brunswick.Leavitt (Lovett, Lovitt) Family Papers, 1783-1875, New Brunswick Museum, Maritime History Archive By the 1840s Leavitt was firmly established as a major player in the region, acting as agent for the Liverpool Association of Underwriters, and for several New York marine insurance companies. Early on Thomas Leavitt obtained a perpetual lease on a harborside lot, allowing him to build his own wharf for his shipping interests as well as charging wharfage fees to other merchants.Thomas Leavitt, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online By 1835 Leavitt, the son of an American emigrant to Canada, was named United States Consul for Saint John.A Historical and Statistical Account of New-Brunswick, B.N.A., With Advice to Immigrants, Christopher William Atkinson, Anderson & Bryce, Edinburgh, 1844 Leavitt was confirmed by the United States Senate as U.S. Consul in 1835.Journal of the Executive Proceedings of the Senate of the United States of America, Vol. IV, Government Printing Office, Washington, 1887 He served in the post for eight years, until 1845. Shortly afterwards Thomas Leavitt helped found City Bank in 1837, and subsequently became president of the Bank of New Brunswick after its merger with City Bank.A Guide to New Brunswick, British North America, &c.;, Christopher William Atkinson, Anderson & Bryce, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1843 Leavitt also helped establish the extension of the new Morse Telegraph system to the Maritime Provinces of Canada. He was listed first among incorporators of the New Brunswick Telegraph Company,The New Brunswick Magazine, Vol. I, William Kilby Reynolds, St. John, New Brunswick, 1898 whose mission was connecting the incipient telegraph line from Maine through New Brunswick to Halifax, Nova Scotia.A prime force behind the new Morse telegraph was the U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, a descendant of the other early colonial American Leavitt settler, John Leavitt of Hingham, Massachusetts. Aside from his business interests, Leavitt also served as the Worshipful Master of the Freemasons in New Brunswick.History of the Ancient and Honorable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, The Fraternity Publishing Company, Boston, Ma., 1891 Leavitt was a Church of Scotland Presbyterian, and was active in St. Andrew's Church in Saint John, where he participated in the 1832 attempt by church trustees to wrest control of church finances from the elders. Leavitt was also part of a large group of Saint John Presbyterians who challenged the Church of England‚Äôs monopoly on education in the province in the 1830s. The group successfully demanded the appointment of non- Episcopalians to the Madras School Board and to the council of King‚Äôs College. Thomas Leavitt died in Saint John on October 24, 1850, at the age of 55. Leavitt and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e Ketchum) had four sons and three daughters. The Leavitt family papers, including logbooks for the family's fleet of vessels, family correspondence, bills and promissory notes and other memorabilia, are deposited at the New Brunswick Museum. Today's Saint John, New Brunswick The family's name is pronounced \\"Lovett\\" in New Brunswick.The rendering of the Leavitt name as \\"Lovett\\", customary in Saint John, is inexplicable. Perhaps the large Scotch population in Saint John was more familiar with the Scottish Lovett family, who are unrelated to the Leavitt family of America. ==ReferencesSources== * Leavitt (Lovett, Lovitt) Family Papers, 1783-1875, New Brunswick Museum, Maritime History Archive ==External links== * Maritime History Archive, Leavitt Family Papers Category:1795 births Category:1850 deaths Category:Politicians in New Brunswick Category:Canadian diplomats Category:American diplomats Category:Canadian people of English descent Category:People from Saint John, New Brunswick Category:Scotiabank presidents ","title":"Thomas Leavitt (banker)"},{"id":"20398158","text":"The GE ES59ACi, also known as the HXN5 or China Mainline Locomotive, is a type of diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems and Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works for use on freight trains from Harbin to Qiqihar and Mudanjiang in the People's Republic of China.

He served under the Confederacy during the Civil War, but he was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Soon after the end of the war, Wilkes started the first national bank in the South after the war. By December 15, 1865, Wilkes had received $500,000 in U.S. bonds. The same year, First National Bank became the only North Carolina bank printing National Bank Notes. This bank played a major role in Charlotte's growth, as did the city's railroad access to other areas. Rufus Y. McAden, founder of the mills and mill village that became McAdenville, succeeded Wilkes as bank president in 1867. Robert M. Oates became president in 1891, and McAden's son Henry M. McAden served as president from 1907 until the bank's failure in 1930. ==Later years== Rufus McAden and his family actually lived in the bank's three-story building on South Tryon Street. His son demolished the building in 1925 and chose Louis Asbury, a leading Charlotte architect who had designed Henry's Myers Park home in 1916, to design what became the second tallest building in the state. The opening of the 250-foot, 21-story building, built at a cost of $1.8 million, was announced September 9, 1927, and The Charlotte News proclaimed Charlotte's strength as a banking center. Later in 1927, the Federal Reserve opened its branch office on the building's nineteenth floor. This showed Charlotte appeared likely to become a major banking center. However, three years after it opened, the building was only 30 percent occupied. The bank would not rent to just anyone, unlike the nearby Johnston Building. ==Failure== On December 4, 1930, First National Bank announced it was closed. One reason given for the bank's failure was the ambitious building program, combined with the inability to make money from the new skyscraper. At the time, First National had only $1.6 million in deposits, the least of seven commercial banks in the city. ==References== Category:Banks based in North Carolina Category:Defunct banks of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in North Carolina Category:Banks established in 1865 ","title":"First National Bank of Charlotte"},{"id":"20398235","text":"JEJ may refer to: * Jej, Afghanistan * James Earl Jones (born 1931), American actor * Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer) (1915‚Äì2001), Second World War flying ace * Jeh Airport, on Ailinglaplap Atoll, Marshall Islands * Japana Esperanto- Junularo ÔºàÊó•Êú¨ÈùíÂπ¥„Ç®„Çπ„Éö„É©„É≥„ÉàÈÄ£Áµ°‰ºöÔºâ, Japanese Esperanto-Youth ","title":"JEJ"},{"id":"20398247","text":"Andrew Paul (Pepper) Oyler (May 5, 1880 - October 24, 1970) was a Major League Baseball third baseman. He was born in Newville, Pennsylvania and attended Washington & Jefferson College. He played professionally for the Baltimore Orioles in the season. In 27 professional games that year, he had 77 at-bats with 17 hits and one home run. He batted and threw right-handed. He was small in stature and was an excellent fielder, but not a good hitter. Even so, he was difficult to pitch to, since he would crouch \\"pretzel-like\\" in the batter's box to make his strike zone smaller. He died in East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania. ==Shortest home run in history== In 1953, sportswriter Jocko Maxwell published an article in Baseball Digest and item in Catholic Digest describing the shortest home run in baseball history. Maxwell described a baseball game where Oyler, as a shortstop for the Minneapolis Millers, was crouched in the batters' box in the bottom of the 9th and ducked to avoid a pitch thrown at his head. The ball hit Oyler's bat, which was still resting on his shoulder, and became stuck in approximately 24 inches of mud in front of home plate. Oyler was able to complete an inside-the-park home run before any opposing players were able to find the ball. Maxwell's article indicated that the story was originally told by WWRL radio station in Woodside, New York. This story was repeated by sportswriter Bill Bryson, Sr. in Baseball Digest in 1958. Another version of the story, as told by Halsey Hall, had Oyler chopping at a low pitch and sticking the ball into the mud 5 feet from home plate. === Controversy === Baseball historian Stew Thornley is skeptical of the story of Oyler's home run, pointing out that no contemporary news reports described the incident. Other modern reference sources recount the story without caveat. === In Popular Culture === The story was the subject of a book of baseball lore by Michael G. Bryson called The Twenty-Four-Inch Home Run. It was also the inspiration for the children's book, Mudball by Matt Tavares, which won the 2005 Parents' Choice Awards Gold Award. In the \\"Author's Note\\" Tavares describes the story of Oyler's home run as being folklore*. ==Antiques Roadshow== Oyler's grandson appeared on Antiques Roadshow on January 20, 2020. He brought his grandfather's ball from that game to which his grandfather had attached a postage stamp and mailed to his grandmother. A vestige of the stamp was still stuck to the ball. Oyler followed up with a letter to his wife that recounted the entire game and the fact that he had made a 24-inch home run. The grandson said he still had the letter although that is not the case. The ball's value was assessed at $3,000 to $5,000. ==See also== *The Twenty-Four- Inch Home Run ==References Category:1880 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Baltimore Orioles (1901‚Äì02) players Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Washington & Jefferson Presidents baseball players Category:Baseball culture Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players ","title":"Andy Oyler"},{"id":"20398284","text":"HONOReform (Hepatitis Outbreaks National Organization for Reform) ‚Äì is a patient advocacy organization that seeks to promote adherence to injection safety guidelines and increase governmental oversight of outpatient medical facilities.

For years it remained the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in American healthcare history, though similar tragedies continue to occur. Since 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented 33 outbreaks of hepatitis B and C as a result of negligent injection safety practices in nonhospital healthcare settings. In January 2009, the Annals of Internal Medicine noted over 60,000 patients have been verified by the CDC to be potentially exposed to hepatitis in the outbreaks and that these outbreaks are likely only \\"the tip of the iceberg\\".Annals of Internal Medicine: Nonhospital Health Care‚ÄìAssociated Hepatitis B and C Virus Transmission: United States, 1998‚Äì2008CBS Evening News: Hepatitis C Danger In Your MD's Office?‚ÄîFebruary 25, 2008 ==History== HONOReform was founded by Evelyn McKnight, Dr. Tom McKnight, and Travis Bennington, all of Fremont, Nebraska.

HONOReform has fought to raise awareness to widely accepted healthcare standards that call for using syringes and similar products once. In addition to its federal advocacy efforts, HONOReform leaders have helped other communities recover from similar outbreaks.

The CDC Foundation is the convening partner of the Coalition, formed to promote safe injection practices in all U.S. healthcare settings. In 2009, SIPC Founding Partners developed the One & Only Campaign‚Äîa public health education and awareness campaign‚Äîaimed at both healthcare providers and patients to advance and promote safe injection practices. Although safe injection practices represent very basic infection control measures, CDC continues to identify and investigate outbreaks associated with poor practices. Breakdowns in proper infection control have involved providers reusing needles, syringes or single-dose medication vials, all of which are meant for one patient and one procedure. These breaches can cause irreparable damage, exposing patients to bloodborne illnesses such as hepatitis and HIV, and to life-threatening bacterial infections. Through targeted education and awareness efforts, the One & Only Campaign empowers patients and healthcare providers to insist on nothing less than safe injections ‚Äì every time, for every patient. ==Other notable outbreaksLas Vegas, Nevada=== In February 2008, the largest patient notification of its kind occurred when 40,000 patients of the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas were urged to be tested for hepatitis and HIV.(Las Vegas Review Journal, February 28, 2008) Subsequently, an additional 10,000 patients of the center along with 13,000 patients at the Desert Shadow Endoscopy Center were advised to be tested.

Stokes is currently in federal prison, serving a 10-and-a- half-year sentence for insurance fraud, and has had his medical license revoked. Patients impacted by the outbreak pushed for a number of reforms including greater penalties for such actions and a measure that would prohibit or severely limit the reuse of medical devices.This resulted in Governor Jennifer Granholm signing Public Act 25, effective 3/26/10, making reuse of single use medical devices a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both.

DB assigned the name IC T to the project, with \\"T\\" standing for Triebzug (multiple unit). Later, Deutsche Bahn also saw the need for a similar new train for its non- electrified routes, and started the ICT-VT project, with \\"VT\\" standing for Verbrennungstriebwagen (internal combustion motor car). This development resulted in the diesel-powered ICE TD. Deutsche Bahn developed the ICE 3, IC T and ICT-VT projects in parallel. The trains share a general styling concept, notably a lounge section in the front separated only by a glass wall from the driver's compartment, with a view forward over the tracks. Technically, the trains share a lot of components and technical layout, as well as the concept of distributed traction: in contrast to the ICE 1 and ICE 2 designs, the new units were planned not with power cars, but with peripheral underfloor motors, to reduce axle load (important for tilting trains) and increase tractive effort. At first plans were made for a three-car EMU, but in the end, capacity considerations led to a decision to create trains of two different lengths, five (later class 415) and seven (later class 411) cars, the combinations of which allow a sufficient variety of train lengths with a maximum of three trains coupled (possible variations are: 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15 cars total). == Production == The tilt angle can reach 8¬∞ In 1994, Deutsche Bahn placed an order for 40 trains, revised to 43 trains (32 of the 7-car, 11 of the 5-car version) in 1997. The trains were produced by a consortium led by DWA and including Siemens, DUEWAG and Fiat Ferroviaria. DWA (later taken over by Bombardier) produced the end cars, DUEWAG (owned by Siemens, later merged into the parent company) the middle cars, Siemens supplied the electronics and other main parts, and Fiat Ferroviaria (later bought by Alstom) supplied the bogies and the tilting technology. The tilting technology is a hydraulic actuator system based on that of the Italian ETR 460 and ETR 470 second- generation Pendolino trains. In Pendolino bogies, only one axle is driven. In class 411 and class 415 motor cars, the inside axle of both bogies is motorised (configuration (1A)'(A1)'). After the German government abandoned the project of a Transrapid (maglev) line between Hamburg and Berlin, Deutsche Bahn decided to upgrade its conventional line between the two cities to 230 km/h. To serve this line and increase capacity on other lines, in 2002 DB ordered an additional 28 seven-car trains from a consortium consisting of the successors of the companies in the previous one, but this time led by Siemens. This brought the total number of Class 411 trains to 60. The main changes were aimed at reducing costs. === Class 411 === The second (411.1), third (411.2), fifth (411.7) and sixth (411.6) cars are motorised, while the end cars (411.0 and 411.5) carry transformers supplying the next two cars. Thus each train consists of two power units of three coaches plus one unpowered middle car (411.8). The middle car can be removed, and theoretically the trains can be supplemented with an additional middle car. === Class 411, second batch === LED matrix headlights on a second batch class 411The second batch of trains (with car numbers of 411 x51-411 x78) display a number of smaller modifications, mainly to reduce purchase and maintenance costs. The most visible differences outside were the lack of a through window band with tinted glass, and LED matrix headlights. The most apparent differences inside were the scrapping of on-board radio and the replacement of the restaurant with a standing bar. The trains also offer 8 additional seats for a total of 390. === Class 415 === Each five-car train forms a single power unit, with three motorised middle cars (415.1, 415.7, 415.6) between two end cars (415.0, 415.5) carrying transformers. Six trains are intended for domestic service, the other five (car numbers 415 x80-415 x84) for international service towards Switzerland, therefore they were also equipped with the Swiss train safety system and additional narrower pantographs for the Swiss network. The first class 415 train was assembled in the summer of 1998, when testing began. Trials with the activated tilting system started in October 1998. Software errors delayed the commissioning. The first class 411 was delivered in early 1999. Shortly before entering service, the product name of the trains was changed to ICE T, with \\"T\\" now standing for the English word tilt(ing). (At the same time, the ICT VT became the ICE TD.) ==Service history== Class 415 entered service on 31 May 1999 between Stuttgart and Zurich. Class 411 entered service on 19 December 1999 between Berlin and D√ºsseldorf via Magdeburg. Later, the Berlin-Munich and Frankfurt-Leipzig-Dresden routes were added. On 6 January 2004, one unit (with cars numbered 411 x06) burnt out. Only the end cars remained intact, and have been used as temporary replacements for damaged end cars of other units. Starting in December 2004, DB took the second batch of 28 more class 411 units into service on the upgraded line between Berlin and Hamburg. This was the first time the ICE T reached its top speed of 230 km/h in regular service. DB accepted the additional trains only after they proved themselves reliable in service, with all trains delivered by the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The trains were delivered with a standing bar in place of a restaurant; however, from 2007, all have been rebuilt with a restaurant. Most trains have been assigned city names. When the capacity of the Switzerland- enabled five-car trains became too low for the Stuttgart-Z√ºrich services, in 2006 the class 415 end cars (which carry the pantographs and the train safety equipment) were switched with that of class 411 trains, thus forming seven-car trains suitable for services to Switzerland. From the timetable change at the end of 2007, 15 class 411 trains modified for service in Austria (three of them sold to the Austrian Federal Railways, see section √ñBB Class 4011 below) connect Frankfurt and Vienna every two hours. Some of these trains come from Dortmund and go via Frankfurt to Vienna. === Service disruption === On 24 October 2008, DB temporarily removed all ICE-T trains from service after a crack was found in an axle of one of the company's fleet of trains. All the trains were to be inspected for similar cracks and repaired as necessary before DB returned them to service. DB decided to sideline the trains after consultation with Siemens, Bombardier and Alstom revealed only \\"unclear information\\" about the expected life span of the axles. At the start of November 2008, a quarter of the trains were back in service. The ultrasonic tests progressed at a speed of two trains a week, with tests on all trains expected to be finished by February 2009. Until the reason for the axle breaks is identified, the checked trains are operated with deactivated tilting system. In January 2009, Deutsche Bahn CEO Hartmut Mehdorn suggested that the axles would have to be replaced with a new design. Development, production and installation of the new axles would take up to two years. == √ñBB 4011 == √ñBB class 4011 092 with a DB class 411 near Seekirchen am Wallersee in Austria Three class 411 units from the first batch have been sold to Austria's √ñBB as class 4011.

It decided that in varying a contract, a promise to perform a pre-existing contractual obligation will constitute good consideration so long as a benefit is conferred upon the 'promiseor'. This was a departure from the previously established principle that promises to perform pre-existing contractual obligations could not be good consideration. ==Facts== Roffey Bros was contracted by Shepherds Bush Housing Association Ltd to refurbish 27 flats at Twynholm Mansions, Lillie Road, London SW6. They subcontracted carpentry to Mr Lester Williams for ¬£20,000 payable in instalments. Some work was done and ¬£16,200 was paid. Then Williams ran into financial difficulty because the price was too low. Roffey Bros was going to be liable under a penalty clause for late completion, so they had a meeting on 9 April 1986 and promised an extra ¬£575 per flat for on time completion. Williams did eight flats and stopped because he had only got ¬£1,500. New carpenters were brought in. Williams claimed. Mr Rupert Jackson QC held Williams should get the eight times ¬£575 with a few deductions for defects and some of the ¬£2,200 owing from the original sum. He said that they had agreed that the original price was too low, and that raising it to a reasonable level was in both sides' interests. ==Judgment== Glidewell LJ held Williams had provided good consideration even though he was merely performing a pre-existing duty. Williams got ¬£3,500 (not full expectation damages). He said that the idea of promissory estoppel was not properly argued and 'not yet been fully developed'.per Lloyd J, Syros Shipping Co. SA v. Elaghill Trading Co. [1980] 2 Lloyds Rep. 390, 392 The concept of economic duress provided an answer to Stilk's old problem, that an agreement to perform an existing legal duty cannot constitute good consideration for a new contract.Stilk v Myrick (1809) 170 ER 1168 The test for understanding whether a contract could legitimately be varied was set out as follows. * if A has a contract to employ B for work * before it is done, A has reason to doubt whether B will, or be able to complete his side of the bargain * A promises B to pay more * A 'obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit' from giving the promise * there is no economic duress or fraud The practical benefit of timely completion, even though a pre-existing duty is performed, constitutes good consideration. On Stilk v Myrick, Glidewell LJ said, However, the principle had not in fact been subjected to any refinement and the three cases he relied on for this proposition - Ward, Williams v Williams and Pao On - unanimously applied it by finding legal consideration (without which the post-contractual modifications would not have been upheld). Glidewell LJ expanded that this test merely refined the Stilk v Myrick principle further but left it unscathed. This is inaccurate as he held that other practical benefits than those envisaged as the original consideration may per se constitute the requisite good consideration to fulfil the contract (something Stilk v Myrick specifically did not allow). The two cases would until then have been seen as indistinguishable on their facts.David McLoughlan, McLoughlan's Contract Law 15th & 16th Edns or whether he overruled the High Court precedent (later relied on in more senior courts) of Stilk v Myrick. Russell LJ, giving his own interpretation in the plaintiff's favour held: He noted that Roffey Bros' employee, Mr Cottrell had felt the original price to be less than reasonable, and there was a further need to replace the 'haphazard method of payment by a more formalised scheme' of money per flat. \\"True it was that the plaintiff did not undertake to do any work additional to that which he had originally undertaken to do but the terms upon which he was to carry out the work were varied and, in my judgment, that variation was supported by consideration which a pragmatic approach to the true relationship between the parties readily demonstrates.\\" Purchas LJ concurred with Glidewell LJ. ==Subsequent cases== In the Court of Appeal considered Williams v Roffey Bros and decided that the principle should not be extended to part payment of debts. ==See also== *Pinnel's Case (1602) 5 Co.

In 1951 the proceedings officially split into three journals, keeping the same name but distinguished from each other by being in separate series. They were Series A (Mathematical Sciences), Series B (Physical Sciences), and Series C (Biological and Medical Sciences). At that time, Series A became published by the North-Holland Publishing Company; the volumes from this time are now listed by the publisher as Indagationes Mathematicae (Proceedings).All papers in Indagationes Mathematicae are now digitized, Tom Koornwinder, June 3, 2015, accessed 2017-01-20.. In 1971, North-Holland merged with Elsevier.Reed Elsevier Timeline, University Library, Northern Illinois University, accessed 2017-01-20. Beginning in 1990 the journal dropped the \\"(Proceedings)\\" from its title, leaving the journal's name in its current form as Indagationes Mathematicae. In 2010, sponsorship of the journal was transferred from the Royal Netherlands Academy to the Royal Dutch Mathematical Society, while it continued to be published by Elsevier. The typesetting from this journal, including its mathematical formulae, was chosen by Donald Knuth as one of three examples of typesetting quality when he designed the TeX digital typesetting software from 1978..

They are generally genetic defects that interfere with muscle's ability to create energy. At the cellular level, metabolic myopathies lack some kind of enzyme that prevent the chemical reactions necessary to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This prevents the muscle cells from being able to function properly and disrupts communication between joints and bones. Some people with a metabolic myopathy never develop symptoms due to the body's ability to produce enough ATP through alternative pathways. In the event more ATP is needed from the affected pathway, the lack of it becomes an issue and symptoms develop. People with a metabolic myopathy often experience symptoms such as progressive muscle weakness, fatigue, pain and cramping after exercise, and considerable breakdown of muscle tissue. The degree of symptoms varies greatly from person to person and is dependent on the severity of enzymatic defect. In extreme cases it can lead to the cause of Rhabdomyolysis. == Types == Metabolic myopathies are generally caused by an inherited genetic mutation. This mutation has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern making it fairly rare to inherit, but it can also be caused by a random genetic mutation. Metabolic myopathies are named after the pathway in which the defective enzyme or a lack of enzymes is present. This causes the underproduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and affects the muscles in different parts of the body. The three main categories of diseases are listed below. * Glycogen storage diseases- defect in sugar metabolism * Lipid storage disorder- defect in fat processing *Mitochondrial myopathy- defect in mitochondrial enzyme == Diagnosis == The symptoms of a metabolic myopathy can be easily confused with the symptoms of another disease. In most cases, a Muscle biopsy is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of the cause of muscle weakness. A blood test can be done under normal circumstances to test for genetic differences and signs of tissue breakdown, or with an added cardio portion that can indicate if muscle breakdown is occurring. An electromyography is sometimes taken in order to rule out other disorders if the cause of fatigue is unknown. Differentiating between different types of metabolic myopathies can be difficult due to the similar symptoms of each type such as Myoglobinuria and exercise intolerance. It has to be determined whether the patient has fixed or exercise induced manifestations, and if exercise related what kind of exercise, before extensive exercise related lab testing is done to determine the underlying cause. == Treatment == Metabolic Myopathies have varying levels of symptoms, being most severe when developed during infancy. Those who do not develop a form of a metabolic myopathy until they are in their young adult or adult life tend to have more treatable symptoms that can be helped with a change in diet and exercise. Depending on what enzyme is affected, a high-protein or low-fat diet may be recommended along with mild exercise. It is important for people with metabolic myopathies to consult with their doctors for a treatment plan in order to prevent acute muscle breakdowns while exercising that lead to the release of muscle proteins into the bloodstream that can cause kidney damage. ==References External links == * Metabolic Myopathies - eMedicine Category:Muscular disorders Category:Metabolic disorders ","title":"Metabolic myopathy"},{"id":"20398402","text":"The cover of the 1959 edition of Billboard Top Country Hits Billboard Top Country Hits is a series of compilation albums released by Rhino Records, each featuring ten hit country music recordings from a specific year, mostly number ones on the Billboard country singles chart.

Francis (March 26, 1870 ‚Äì July 15, 1929) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat from Minnesota. He was a successful personal and civil rights lawyer, winning discrimination cases against the police and employers, and successfully lobbying for state anti-discrimination and anti- lynching legislation. He was the U.S. Minister Resident/Consul General in Liberia, the first African-American diplomat from Minnesota. In Liberia, Francis conducted a nine-month inquiry into allegations of government involvement in slavery and forced labor. He died in post in Liberia of yellow fever. His report helped achieve a League of Nations investigation that ultimately forced the president, Charles D.B. King, and the vice president of Liberia to resign in 1930. ==Early life, education, and career== Francis was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on March 26, 1870 (or April 26, 1869), moving to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1887, without having recognized scholastic qualifications. His middle name is variously reported as Treyanne, Trevane, and Trevanne. He was employed by the Northern Pacific Railway, first as a messenger, then stenographer, and then clerk in the legal department, becoming temporary chief clerk in 1901. He enrolled at William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law), earning his degree in 1904. Francis was appointed chief clerk of the Northern Pacific's legal department, becoming one of the highest-ranking African-American employees of any business in Minnesota, practicing law privately as well. He left Northern Pacific to take over the solo law firm of his friend and mentor, Frederick McGhee, after his 1912 death. He had a busy law practice, covering civil and criminal cases, as well as some involving racial discrimination and civil rights. In 1914, he gained George T. Williams, a Pullman porter, a record $3,000 judgment for malicious prosecution by his employer, but it was overturned on appeal. In 1919, he pursued a successful habeas corpus action, challenging the police practice of holding black women in custody without charge, and challenged others for refusing services on the grounds of race . He is reported to have said that while black lawyers could gain some white clients at that time, racial barriers prevented them from reaching their full potential. ==Political and diplomatic career== Francis was a Republican, taking moderate positions on race in public. He was an admirer of Booker T. Washington, supporting and participating in civil rights organizations like the National Afro-American Council. In 1906, Francis ran for St. Paul city assembly and lost, but received a respectable 9,000 votes. Francis also lost a bid for U.S. Minister to Haiti in 1911, as well as a run for the state assembly in 1912. In 1915, he lobbied the city council to ban the film, Birth of a Nation, because of its racist content. The NAACP reported that Francis was nominated over a white opponent in the 1916 Republican primary for the Thirty-eighth district in Saint Paul. He does not appear, however, to have won office. In 1919, Francis gave a speech on Reconstruction and race relations, encouraging the audience to, despite the unfairness, \\"make up your mind to improve your condition and do it\\". In 1920, he was appointed to the Minnesota Republican Central Committee, serving as a president elector at the Republican State Convention. Around then, his wife helped earn women the right to vote, and wrote the state anti-lynching bill after a particularly brutal lynching episode in Duluth in June 1920. Francis supported his wife in getting the bill passed in the Minnesota legislature in 1921, but the principal credit is hers. There was still no Federal anti-lynching law at that time. William Francis also successfully lobbied through a bill against racial discrimination in hairdressing schools. On July 9, 1927, he was appointed U. S. Minister Resident/Consul General to Liberia by President Calvin Coolidge. He died in post in Liberia two years later. In 1928, he had been assigned by the Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, to investigate rumors of government involvement in slavery and forced labor. Francis ran a nine-month inquiry, establishing that government officials including the president, Charles D.B. King, had profited from forced removal of young men from Liberia into forced labor on Spanish plantations on Bioko Island. After Francis' death, his report helped ensure a League of Nations investigation which led to the resignation of the president and vice president of Liberia. ==Personal life== Nellie Griswold Francis Francis married Nellie Griswold Francis on August 14, 1893, a leading African-American suffragist and civic activist, originally from Nashville, Tennessee. They are reported to have had a particularly happy marriage, with 25th anniversary celebrations reported in the news. His wife's sister and brother-in-law lived with them. Francis was a member of Pilgrim Baptist Church, where both he and his wife were singers. Francis also acted in plays and musicals. Francis was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1924, the couple bought a two-storey house on Sargent Avenue in the Groveland Park neighborhood of St. Paul, and faced vicious and threatening opposition from some white residents. The local improvement association first offered to buy the house, then began marching out front with burning flares, sending threatening letters and making threatening phone calls. Two crosses were burned on their lawn, said to be the Ku Klux Klan's final warning. The Francises remained in the house until they moved to Liberia. Francis died after a month of suffering, on July 15, 1929 in Liberia. Previously thought to have malaria, he was diagnosed with yellow fever. A despatch from the legation stated that \\"The intense pain and suffering of the Minister can hardly be described\\". Nellie Francis returned to Tennessee, and died in 1969. They are buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Nashville, William Francis having first had a funeral at the Pilgrim Baptist Church in St. Paul on August 11, 1929. There was another funeral service in Nashville, and a Masonic burial. ==References*Minnesota Black Newspaper Index, Minnesota Historical Society Category:1869 births Category:1929 deaths Category:American anti- lynching activists Category:Activists from Minnesota Category:Politicians from Indianapolis Category:Politicians from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:William Mitchell College of Law alumni Category:Minnesota lawyers Category:Minnesota Republicans Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Liberia Category:Deaths from yellow fever ","title":"William T.

Her elderly parents, who had been living in the house, both died ‚Äì Geraldine had been their primary carer. As well as this, her son Owen committed suicide. At about the same time, Patricia Reid got to know Geraldine and began to help her around the house. It was Reid who initially rang Desperate Houses. Her daughter is the same age as Geraldine's daughter Sin√©ad and they are best friends. Reid felt that Geraldine really deserved a helping hand from the Desperate Houses crew. Much of the clutter in the house belongs to either her deceased parents or her deceased son.  \\"Programme 5 - Finglas\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2007  Anna Galway via Athlone/Letterkenny to Carlow  Anna is a native of Galway, although when she was in her teens she moved with her family (three brothers and one sister) to Athlone. A couple of years after finishing school, she got a job in Letterkenny with An Post. After completing her training in Letterkenny, she was transferred to Carlow. There she met \\"Pat the farmer\\" as she calls him. Her father had worked in the Department of Agriculture for years and she always swore that she would never marry a farmer. However she settled down to life on the farm and they have four kids, named David, Sarah, James and Andrew. Although Anna was based in Carlow, she remained very close with her two parents. Her mother died three years ago just as Anna was recovering from postnatal depression after giving birth to Andrew. Her mother's unexpected death worsened her depression. For months, her eldest daughter Sarah (then an 11-year-old) took over the running of the house. A friend suggested she see a homeopath and Anna's condition started to improve. All this affected the tidiness of the house. Pat's working hours were long due to the nature of his work. Anna has since retired from the post office and has enrolled herself in college to do a childcare course which she claims to love. Her home is a \\"good sized\\" detached house. The rooms in the worst condition are the playroom, the upstairs landing and her daughter's room. The entire house is fairly cluttered.  \\"Programme 6 - Carlow\\" } ===Series four=== The fourth series contained six episodes and was broadcast over November and December 2008. {  - \\" ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Date ! style=\\"width:180px;\\" Desperate House/Person(s) ! style=\\"width:570px;\\" Background ! style=\\"width:40px;\\" Ref - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  11 November 2008  Angie Williams Letterfrack, County Galway  Williams, an artist and wood-turner originally from Liverpool, has been living in Letterfrack for nearly thirty years.

He was a Commandant of the RMC. ==Education== 624 Major General William Henry Pferinger Elkins was born on 13 June 1883 at Sherbrooke, Quebec. He graduated from the Bishop's College School in Quebec in 1899 and Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in June 1905. ==Career== He was commissioned in the Royal Canadian Artillery; his first posting was to \\"B\\" Battery, RCHA. He served with \\"N\\" Battery, RHA in India from 1908 to 1910, and while on the sub-continent completed his Captain qualifying examination. He served as Commanding Officer RCHA Brigade 1916 ‚Äì 1922. In December 1917, he was evacuated due to illness and convalesced at the Prince of Wales Hospital for Officers at Marylebone, England. He returned to duty with the Brigade in time for the German Offensive in the Spring of 1918. Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins controlled the movement and deployment of his own two batteries as well as twelve additionally assigned batteries. He withdrew more than fifty-six kilometres in ten days while under constant enemy pressure. A command of this size was normally a job for a Brigadier with a sizeable staff. In October 1918, a Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery Battery along with \\"I\\" and \\"N\\" Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery were placed under his command. In an operation supporting an attack on the high ground north of Montay, France the Canadians advanced eight miles on a front of more than three miles, to 400 prisoners and captured a large number of enemy weapons. This action earned Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins a Bar to his DSO. Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins and his Brigade returned to their usual peacetime duties of training the militia; he continued in command until 1922 when he was appointed Commandant Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Other successive appointments were Camp Commandant Petawawa, another short term as Commander of the RCHA Brigade and Chairman of the Standing Arms Committee. He was promoted Colonel in 1925. On his subsequent promotion to Brigadier General in 1930, he was appointed to command the Royal Military College of Canada, a post he held until 1935. He was concerned that cadets were prioritising sports during the games season to the detriment of their studies. He introduced an academic eligibility rule in 1931-2 for participation in hockey and football. He divided the cadet battalion into 6 companies instead of 2 to enable greater participation in intramural sports. He stepped up intramural hockey and Canadian football ‚Äì increasing the number of games and the number of participants. RMC aims were to produce officers and engineers, and to provide a general and cultural education. In 1932, the competition to enter RMC was particularly hot, perhaps a consequence of the Great Depression. Since many recruits had qualifications higher than junior matriculation, they repeated work they had done before and risked becoming bored. Consequently, some elementary science work was dropped in favour of advanced studies in imperial geography, military history and economics. Many parents preferred that their sons prepare for careers in law, accounting or business to engineering. During the construction and industrial growth slump in the Great Depression, engineers found it hard to find employment. In 1932, Elkins disciplined and demoted a BSM to Corporal for recruiting/hazing \\"conducting physical training exercises‚Ä¶ in the dormitory\\" contrary to orders. He served as District Officer Commanding 2nd Military District 1935 ‚Äì 1938. He was Master-General of Ordnance, National Defence Headquarters 1938 ‚Äì 1940. He served as General Officer Commander in Chief Atlantic Command 1940 ‚Äì 1943. He retired in 1944. He died in 1964. ==Honours== Major-General Elkins was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 1 January 1935 and in November 1938 was appointed Master General of Ordnance. In 1943 he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and invested as a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). ==Legacy== The Elkins piano room at the Royal Artillery (RA) Park Officers Mess in Halifax, Nova Scotia was named in his honour. ===Books=== *4237 Dr. Adrian Preston & Peter Dennis (Edited) \\"Swords and Covenants\\" Rowman And Littlefield, London.

In philately, they are among the most sought-after Swiss stamps, with a 5 rappen Rayon I stamp selling for the record price of CHF 348,000 (USD 293,000) at auction in 2008. After the reconstitution of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848, the authority to operate a postal service passed from the cantons to the Confederation, and the federal postal service was founded in 1849. Its local mail and rayon stamps were the first definitive stamps valid in all of Switzerland, although the stamps issued by the postal authorities of the cantons of Geneva, Basel-Stadt and Z√ºrich remained concurrently valid until 1854, when all stamps were supplanted by the \\"Sitting Helvetia\\" series of federal stamps. ==Rayons== The first Swiss postal regulations divided Switzerland, for the purpose of mailing letters weighing no more than half a lot, into four rayons. These were defined by the distance or road transport time (whichever was higher) between sender and recipient. A special, lower rate applied to letters mailed within a municipality. Rayon IV, defined by a distance of more than 192 km or a transport time of more than 40 hours, for which a postage of 20 Rappen was due, was abandoned in 1852 and became part of Rayon III. No stamps were ever issued for it. {  ; !Stamp !Charging area (Rayon) !Postage !Transport hours max. !Transport distance max. !Date of first issue - 150px Local mail 2¬Ω rappen Within the municipality Within the municipality May 1850 - 150px Rayon I 5 rappen 2 hours 9.6 km 1 October 1850 - 150px Rayon II 10 rappen 10 hours 48 km 1 October 1850 - 150px Rayon III 15 rappen 40 hours 192 km 1 January 1852 } ==Stamp design== The stamps depict a bugle atop the Swiss coat of arms. They are labeled with their denomination and with the corresponding rayon or, as the case may be, as stamps for local mail. All stamps were issued in German and French, with the French versions substituting \\"cts.\\" for \\"Rp.\\" and \\"Poste locale\\" for \\"Orts-Post\\".

He was born in Bordeaux. He was a student of Louis Aubert at the Conservatoire de Paris, but in 1927 failed to graduate, apparently because of his refusal to follow orthodox methods. Along with Pierre-Octave Ferroud and Jean Rivier, he helped to form the society Triton for the wider distribution of contemporary music. After the Liberation of Paris in 1944, he was named the Director of Paris Radio, and later, in 1948, of what later became ORTF, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. ==Works== As a composer, Barraud wrote opera music, ballet music, orchestral music, chamber music, choral music and other vocal music. Paul Paray and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra recorded Barraud's orchestral work Offrande √† une ombre in 1957 for Mercury Records. This wartime memorial, commemorating the death during combat of Maurice Jaubert at the age of 40, was initially released on LP in monophonic sound; the stereophonic version was issued on CD by Philips Records. A work listed as Symphony #1 for full orchestra (not just strings) was recorded on French Columbia FCX 597 (LP) performed by Georges Tzipine leading the ORTF.

He finished the year in sixth place and also took part in the end‚Äìof‚Äìseason Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, where he failed to finish. He continued in the series in 2006, improving to fourth place in the championship. He took four podium finishes during the season, including a win at Thruxton. He again took part in the Formula Ford Festival, this time competing in the Duratec class, but once again retired from the race. ===Formula Three=== In 2007, Ebbesvik moved up to Formula Three, competing in the Spanish championship for the British outfit Team West‚ÄìTec. He was entered into the secondary Copa de Espa√±a class, which featured older‚Äìgeneration Dallara chassis. At the end of the season, he finished tied on points with Peruvian driver Juan Manuel Polar, but took the title by virtue of taking more second places than Polar after they scored seven class wins each. For 2008, he remained with Team West‚ÄìTec in Spanish Formula Three, beginning the year with a Dallara F306 chassis before switching to a newer F308 model after the first two rounds of the season. In August of that year, Ebbesvik dominated the most prestigious race of the season to win on the Valencia Street Circuit, with the race acting as a support event for the Formula One . He took a further race win at Jerez in October to finish the championship in tenth place, one position ahead of team‚Äìmate Jonathan Legris. Ebbesvik continued in the championship for a third year in 2009, when the series was renamed as the European F3 Open Championship. He finished the season in fifth place, taking a single victory at Donington Park with further podium places at Magny‚ÄìCours and Monza. ===Formula Le Mans Cup=== In May 2009, Ebbesvik contested the opening two races of the new Formula Le Mans Cup at Spa‚ÄìFrancorchamps. Sharing an Oreca FLM09 with Swiss driver Christophe Pillon, he finished both races in fifth position. ===Le Mans Series=== Ebbesvik made a full-time switch from single‚Äìseaters to sportscar racing in 2010, racing for Team Bruichladdich in the LMP2 class of the Le Mans Series and Le Mans 24 Hours, sharing a Ginetta‚ÄìZytek GZ09SB/2 with Tim Greaves and Karim Ojjeh. In the second event of the season, the Spa 1000 km, Ebbesvik was injured after an accident involving a slower GT car, sustaining a fractured vertebra which subsequently ruled him out of the following month's Le Mans 24 Hours. Two overall fifth‚Äìplace finishes, including anchoring the team to its best ever podium position in LMP2, at the following two rounds in Portim√£o and Hungaroring ensured that he finished the year in fifth position in the LMP2 standings. Indeed, at the season finale at Silverstone, Ebbesvik managed to take the Zytek into the LMP2 lead for the first time ever, although the car was subsequently crashed by Ojjeh. Ebbesvik was due to continue with the team in 2011, competing alongside Ojjeh and team newcomer Gary Chalandon, but was surprisingly and unexpectedly replaced by Tom Kimber‚ÄìSmith a few weeks before the start of the season. He did, however, sign a last‚Äìminute deal to race in the season‚Äìopening event at Paul Ricard, where he finished 10th overall in an LMP2 class Oreca 03‚ÄìJudd entered by Race Performance. For the second round of the season, the Spa 1000 km, Ebbesvik was set to graduate to the premier LMP1 class, racing a Lola‚ÄìJudd for the Guess Racing Europ team, but the entry was withdrawn as the car would not be ready in time for the event. For the final two rounds of the 2011 Le Mans Series, Ebbesvik signed to Boutsen Energy to lead their LMP2 campaign, replacing their previous pro driver, Nicolas de Crem, in the team's Oreca 03-Nissan. ===Other series=== In September 2007, Ebbesvik became the first ever Norwegian to drive a GP2 car when he tested for Racing Engineering at the Jerez circuit. The following year, he once again took part in GP2 series testing, driving for Racing Engineering, Arden International, DAMS and Fisichella Motor Sport at both Paul Ricard and Jerez. He had intended to race in GP2 in 2009, but could not find the required budget to compete. In November 2008, Ebbesvik also took part in Formula Renault 3.5 Series testing, driving for both Comtec Racing and Fortec Motorsport in Valencia. ==Racing recordCareer summary=== {  style=\\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\\" !Season !Series !Team !Races !Wins !Poles !F/Laps !Podiums !Points !Position - !rowspan=2 2005 align=left British Formula Ford Championship align=left rowspan=2 Team JLR  20  0  0  0  0  321  6th - align=left Formula Ford Festival  1  0  0  0  0  N/A  NC - !rowspan=2 2006 align=left British Formula Ford Championship align=left rowspan=2 Team JLR  20  1  0  2  4  357  4th - align=left Formula Ford Festival ‚Äì Duratec Class  1  0  0  0  0  N/A  NC - !rowspan=2 2007 align=left Spanish Formula Three Championship ‚Äì Copa de Espa√±a align=left rowspan=2 Team West‚ÄìTec  14  7  3  ?  12  118 FFFFBF;\\" 1st - align=left Spanish Formula Three Championship  14  0  0  0  0  7  16th - !rowspan=2 2008 align=left Spanish Formula Three Championship ‚Äì Copa de Espa√±a align=left rowspan=2 Team West‚ÄìTec  4  0  0  0  0  10  12th - align=left Spanish Formula Three Championship  17  2  1  0  2  49  10th - !rowspan=2 2009 align=left European F3 Open Championship align=left Team West‚ÄìTec  16  1  1  1  3  64  5th - align=left Formula Le Mans Cup align=left Hope Polevision Racing  2  0  0  0  0  16  20th - ! 2010 align=left Le Mans Series ‚Äì LMP2 align=left Team Bruichladdich  5  0  0  0  1  46  5th - ! 2011 align=left Le Mans Series ‚Äì LMP2 align=left Race Performance Boutsen Energy Racing  3  0  0  0  0  18  13th } ==References *Official website *Career details from Driver Database Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bergen Category:Norwegian racing drivers Category:Euroformula Open Championship drivers Category:Formula Ford drivers Category:European Le Mans Series drivers ","title":"Thor-Christian Ebbesvik"},{"id":"20398831","text":"Terrance D.

From the outset, it was significantly influenced by the style of Iron Maiden.Official website: Biography In May 2019, the band announced they would be disbanding following their performance at the Kilkim ≈Ωaibu festival the following month on June 23. == Members  Final lineup === * Riƒçardas Laginauskas ‚Äì guitar, vocal, * Rimantas Budri≈´nas ‚Äì bass guitar, * Salvijus ≈Ωeimys ‚Äì drums. === Former members === * Povilas Me≈°kƒóla ‚Äì vocals (episodically also trombone), * Romas Rainys ‚Äì guitar, * Marius Giedrys ‚Äì drums, * Naglis Patamsis ‚Äì keyboard, * Algimantas Radaviƒçius ‚Äì bass guitar, * Domas Dƒódinas - drums, * Gediminas Jurgaitis - bass guitar. == History  Beginning === In its first incarnation, Katedra was composed of the three musicians: Riƒçardas Laginauskas on guitar, Algimantas Radaviƒçius on bass, and Marius Giedrys on drums. Later, former Foje guitarist Romas Rainys and even then-unknown vocalist Povilas Me≈°kƒóla joined the band. December 1986 was the official start of Katedra. === Mors Ultima Ratio and break up === In 1989 band finished recording their first LP called \\"Mors Ultima Ratio\\" (Latin: \\"Death is the final accounting\\"). Although, it was released a year after recording, Katedra's first vinyl album gained extreme popularity in Lithuania. \\"Mors Ultima Ratio\\" was also noticed by Edgar Klusener from \\"Metal Hammer\\" magazine. He described Katedra as: \\"that is pure thrash metal act, strong both musically and technically. In fact the formation is superior in comparison with 90 percent of similar Western acts. So it is evident how far the music in Lithuania made headway. Katedra are the only matadors in Lithuania and maybe stand among the hottest European thrash metal bands\\".Metal Hammer, November 1989> Gained popularity, opened doors to concerts abroad. In 1991 Katedra played at \\"Baltic Sea Music Festival\\" in Sweden. Unfortunately, it was the last gig for Povilas Me≈°kƒóla and Romas Rainys with the band. Soon after the festival they left Katedra. === Downturn === The band was now seeking another shift: Riƒçardas took over the vocalist position. The band's output at this time included the album \\"Natus in articulo mortis\\"; their music became more severe; and Riƒçardas's vocal entry of the Katedra sounds from the standard clich√©s. The trio played many concerts and their albums were played on Lithuanian radio stations. Later, and for some time, concert activity was stopped. Although the trio continued to build and perform together, the group's name was almost forgotten. It was a new generation, and new names appeared on the Metal stage. In February 2001, the band was invited to play an acoustic concert on Lithuanian national television. The group relied on its own feet‚Äîand played live. === Revival and disbandment === From 2003 the band helped keyboardist Naglis Patamsis. The musicians tried to experiment more. In the autumn of 2003, longtime band member Marius Giedrys left Katedra. He was replaced by a new drummer, Domas Dƒódinas (who has played in bands such as Inquest, Undertaker, Dahmer, Mezopsychya and Herosgamos). After a successful appearance at Lithuania's largest rock festival \\"The nights of rock 2004\\" in Plateliai, managers found Katedra and booked the band for a few concert programs, which have been shown with success in Lithuanian club music scenes, and also in several foreign festivals. In the 2005 summer festival \\"The nights of rock 2005\\", Katedra presented a retrospective of its old and new songs with the string duo Gleb Py≈°niak (cello) and Kristina Baltru≈°aitytƒó (viola). In August 2004, the band announced its third album (and first album on CD format) \\"III\\". It was presented in 2006 \\"The nights of rock\\". 2006 Band bassist Algis Radaviƒçius was replaced by Gediminas Jurgaitis (previously, he had played in the band \\"Hersh tu\\"? At the end of 2007, Domas Dƒódinas was replaced by Salvijus ≈Ωeimys (ex \\"Ossuary\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"Green Bridge Band\\" and others), who also performs with bands \\"Skylƒó\\", \\"Atalyja\\" and \\"ExLibris\\". In September 2008, the group signed a contract with Atra Musica for a fourth album, \\"Ugnikalnis\\" (Lithuanian: Volcano) On November 1, 2008, the band's fourth album, \\"Ugnikalnis\\", saw the light of day. In the end of 2010 Gediminas Jurgaitis left the band. Bass players place was taken by Rimantas Budri≈´nas. On June 23, 2019, the band played their final performance at the Kilkim ≈Ωaibu festival and disbanded following the concert. == Significant events == *Lituanica ‚Äô88 ir ‚Äò89‚Äú (Vilnius) *‚ÄûRock Panorama‚Äú (Moskow) *‚ÄûRock Summer‚Äú ir ‚ÄûRock Winter‚Äú (Estonia) *‚ÄûLiepajas Dzintars ‚Äô88 ir ‚Äò89‚Äú (Latvia) *‚ÄûSopot‚Äú (Poland) *‚ÄûIlosaari Pop‚Äú (Finland) *‚ÄûBaltic Sea Music Fest '91‚Äú (Sweden) *Lietuvos kult≈´ros dienos Leipcige '94 (Germany) (Lithuanian cultural days in Leipzig) *‚ÄûDeath Comes...2000 ir 2001‚Äú (Vilnius) *‚ÄûFerrum Frost‚Äú 2003 ir 2004 (Vilnius) *‚ÄûRoko naktys 2003,'04, '05, '06, '07, '08‚Äú (Lithuania) *‚ÄûRiga Bike Show 2005‚Äú (Latvia) *Russia biker show ‚ÄûBaltijskij ≈†turm 2005‚Äú (Kaliningrad). ==Discography== # Mors Ultima Ratio (1989) # Natus In Articulo Mortis (1992) # III (2006) # Ugnikalnis (Volcano) (2008) ==References== Category:Lithuanian heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical trios Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:Soviet rock music groups ","title":"Katedra (band)"},{"id":"20398885","text":"Hallsteinn Sigur√∞sson (born 1945) is an Icelandic sculptor and visual artist. He is noted for his Nordic god sculptures, some of which are located at the Lax√° Power Station in the north central part of the country and are arranged in the facility‚Äôs tunnels and vaults. Some twenty five of his sculptures are exhibited in the Gufunes sculpture park in north-east Reykjav√≠k. ==Biography== Hallsteinn Sigur√∞sson was born in 1945 and studied at the School of Arts and Crafts in Iceland from 1963 to 1966, then went to the United Kingdom, where he studied sculpture at the Hornsey College of Art, London (1966‚Äì1967), Hammersmith College of Art, London (1967‚Äì1969) and the St. Martin‚Äôs School of Art, London (1969‚Äì1972).

Hallsteinn held more than a dozen solo exhibitions in the years 1971 to 1997, and has been hired to create monuments for various organizations and municipalities in Iceland. Early in his career, Hallsteinn created sculpture cast from concrete and various plastics. In his more recent works, Hallsteinn most often uses aluminium and iron alloy, generally in abstract and geometric forms. Over time his structures have become lighter in form. Dozens of his works are in public ownership, and his works are represented in the collections of museums including the Borgarness Museum, Icelandic National Gallery and Reykjav√≠k Art Museum in Reykjav√≠k, where he resides. Some twenty-five of his sculptures are exhibited in the Gufunes sculpture park in northeast Reykjav√≠k.

He is also a member of the Icelandic Association of Visual Artists. In 2002 a set of his sculptures based on Nordic mythology was installed in the tunnels and vaults of the Lax√°rvirkjun hydroelectric power station in north-central Iceland, where the works can be seen by visitors each summer.

However, as of Service Pack 2 (released 2009) Microsoft is not claiming Microsoft Office 2007 compatibility with the ISO OOXML standard. ===Open XML Format SDK=== Microsoft Open XML Format SDK contains a set of managed code libraries to create and manipulate Office Open XML files programmatically. Version 1.0 was released on June 10, 2008 and incorporates the changes made to the Office Open XML specification made during the current ISO/IEC standardization process. Version 2 of the Open XML SDK supports validating Office Open XML documents against the Office Open XML schema, as well as searching in Office Open XML documents. On March 13, 2008 Doug Mahugh, a senior product manager at Microsoft specializing in Office client interoperability and the Open XML file formats, confirmed that version 1.0 of the Open XML Format SDK \\"will definitely be 100% compliant with the final ISO/IEC 29500 spec, including the changes accepted at the BRM\\". In a ComputerWorld interview from 2008, Doug Mahugh said that \\"Microsoft would continue to update the SDK to make sure that applications built with it remained compliant with an Open XML standard as changes were made in the future\\". By June 2014, the Open XML SDK was at version 2.5 and had been released as open source under the Apache License 2.0 on GitHub.Open-XML-SDK on githubThe Open XML SDK is Now Open Source  Eric White ==See also== * Comparison of Office Open XML software * Network effect * Open format * Office suite * OpenDocument Format ==References *Microsoft's office open XML Community website Category:Office Open XML Category:Lists of software * ","title":"List of software that supports Office Open XML"},{"id":"20399260","text":"The 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup was the 96th edition of the USSF's annual national soccer championship, running from June through early September.

The eight MLS clubs receive byes into the third round, while the remaining 32 teams play in the first two round with brackets influenced by geography. Seattle Sounders FC defeated defending-champion D.C. United 2‚Äì1 in the final at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. Both clubs had started in the MLS qualification tourney, and ended up playing 6 matches each. ==Matchdays== Match pairings were announced on May 27. { - ! width=\\"100px\\"Date ! width=\\"100px\\"Round ! width=\\"250px\\"Notes - June 9 First Round 32 USL and USASA clubs enter - June 16 Second Round  - June 30/July 1 Third Round 8 MLS clubs enter - July 7 Quarterfinals  - July 21 Semifinals  - September 2 Final  } ==Teams== As in the previous tournament, forty teams qualified to the tournament. The qualifying process for MLS took the form of an eight-team play-off tournament. The top six finishers, regardless of conference, in 2008 were given six of the berths into the Third Round. The eight remaining U.S.-based clubs competed for the final two berths via a playoff. Continuing the format of recent seasons, no qualification process was needed for USL-1 and USL-2 as each level has exactly eight U.S.-based clubs for the 2009 season. The PDL announced that four selected early season games will again double as qualifying matches, as they had in recent years. Each division received a berth, since there are eight divisions instead of the ten that existed in 2008. The qualifying process for the USASA took the form of four regional tournaments, with the two finalists in each region being awarded berths. ;Major League Soccer (8 teams) *Chicago Fire *Chivas USA *Columbus Crew *D.C.

His company, American Placer Corporation, processed the shale by creating a mud and then removing the gold deposits by mercury amalgamation, which required a steady source of power. Finding a coal seam up river, Spencer commissioned a San Francisco company, Robertson‚ÄìSchultz Co., to build the stern-wheel paddle steamer, Charles H. Spencer, for the American Placer Corporation. James Robertson and Herman Rosenfelt built the ship. It was 92.5 feet long, 25 feet abeam and had a draft of 18 to 20 inches.Richard E.

The various parts were manufactured in San Francisco, shipped by rail to Marysvale, Utah, and conveyed by ox-cart to the mouth of Warm Creek, where the boat was assembled. The boat averaged 5‚Äì6 tons of coal on each trip. But by the end of the summer the operation was curtailed. The boat was docked and then abandoned in 1914. During a flood in 1921, the boat sank in shallow water. Later the superstructure was stripped of its lumber.

Alpert is a pioneering teacher and researcher of Yiddish traditional dance and has been central to restoring Yiddish dance to its time-honored place in tandem with klezmer music. He is a recipient of the 2015 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States‚Äô highest honor to exponents of the folk and traditional arts. Alpert continues to perform and teach worldwide. Alpert has travelled throughout Eastern Europe and the Americas to document Jewish traditional musicians and singers, and published an article in American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots about Warsaw-born klezmer drummer Ben Bazyler (1922-1990). (readable here on Google Books). Alpert can be credited with initiating the revival of rhythmic and harmonic \\"sekund\\" fiddling in klezmer music, an important aspect of traditional klezmer string technique which had fallen out of use in Yiddish music before the klezmer revitalization.

However, he had to leave school and work as a carpenter with his uncle in order support his family after his father broke his hip and became bedridden. His mother got him the job. ===Career=== Poverty compelled him to join the army in October 1940. He had to present himself as being 21 although he was only 17. It was a requirement for joining the Cape Corps that he have a driver's license. He however did not have one thus joining the artillery entity instead. Here he was accepted as a white and conceded to this, as he puts it, \\"to feed his family not to be accepted as a white man\\". This experience had a lasting impact on him: being a soldier in a whites only battalion, he carried this secret for five years. Then he returned after having served in Kenya, Ethiopia and Egypt, alas, too late for his father had passed on. He had spent twenty months in the north of Italy as a prisoner of war before he escaped. 12 June 1948 he married Gazina Ortell from Siena, who became the mother of his twelve children, in a court in Kimberley. He worked for a while in Swaziland and Botswana, using the trade taught to him earlier in his life and settled as a building contractor in Mafikeng, South Africa (then Bophuthatswana). As a result of the Apartheid legislation he could never realise his lifelong ideal of owning a cattle farm although he could afford to acquire a farm in cash. In 1995 Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz debuted, at the age of 75, with his novel Vatmaar. Although the novel has an Afrikaans mindset he wrote it initially in English, in neat, fully handwritten hardcover books before his daughter Elizabeth translated it. He worked on the story for a period of three years before sending it to David Phillip Publishers in Cape Town, who then forwarded it to Kwela Books (Afrikaans Publishing Company) as the story did not translate so well. Kwela Books was a newly established company with the goal of finding new talent. Annarie van der Merwe of Kwela Books decided that it was an Afrikaans story so it should be published in Afrikaans. Scholtz wrote two more books while waiting for the publication of Vatmaar, which were published later: ' (1996) and '(1998). ===Death and afterward=== On 17 November 2004 Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz diedChris van der Merwe: AHM Scholtz: 'n Huldeblyk.

William A. Lockwood,Halsem v. Lockwood, 37 (Conn.) 500, 1871 Connecticut, (1871) is an important United States case in property, tort, conversion, trover and nuisance law. The plaintiff directed his servants to rake abandoned horse manure into heaps that had accumulated in a public street, intending to carry it away the next day. Before he could do so, the defendant, who had no knowledge of the plaintiff's actions, found the heaps and hauled them off to his own land. The plaintiff sued the defendant in trover demanding payment for the price of the manure. The trial court held for the defendant, stating he owed nothing to the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed and the Appellate Court of Connecticut held for the plaintiff, remanding the case for a new trial. The manure originally belonged to the owners of the horses that dropped it. But when the owners abandoned it on the road, it became the property of the man who was first to claim it. The Court found that the best owner after the act of abandonment was the borough of Stamford, Connecticut where the manure was found. In the absence of a claim to the manure by the officials of Stamford, the plaintiff was entitled to it by reason of trover. The plaintiff was entitled to damages because the defendant had committed a conversion. The manure had not become a part of the real estate, as the defendant had argued. It remained separate and unattached to the land, and hence was not part of the fee of estate. Comparing manure to seaweed and laws in the 19th century having to do with the scraping into piles of natural things of this sort, the court held that 24 hours was a reasonable time for the defendant to wait to take the manure. That by this standard, and the fruits of his labour of raking into piles, the plaintiff was granted a new trial over the issue of damages. ==Issues== # Is manure abandoned on a road by passing horses property subject to the laws of trover? # Does manure abandoned on the road by passing horses become a part of the land, and in essence attached to it as part of the fee of ownership? # Does a person who gathers the manure into heaps improve it, and hence have claim to ownership? # Does a third party who happens by and takes as his own the manure which has been placed in heaps by another commit a conversion? # If the third party is guilty of committing a conversion, what are the damages to the plaintiff? ==Facts== A case in trover for a quantity of manure, brought before a justice of the peace and appealed by the defendant to the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Fairfield, and tried in that court, on the general issue concerning the matter of ownership of the manure before Justice Brewer. At trial it was proved that the plaintiff employed two men to gather into heaps, on the evening of April 6, 1869, some manure that lay scattered on the ground along the side of a public highway. Most of this manure was from horses passing by. The men continued their efforts through the town of Stamford, Connecticut. They started at 6 PM and by 8 PM, their efforts had resulted in eighteen heaps, which was enough to fill six cart-loads. While the heaps consisted largely of manure, there were also traces of soil, gravel and straw which are commonly seen along roadways. The defendant saw the piles the next morning. He inquired of the town warden to whom they belonged, and if he had given permission to anyone for their removal. The town warden did not know to whom the manure belonged and had not given permission to anyone for the removal. Learning this, the defendant removed the manure to his own land, where it was scattered on a field. The plaintiff and defendant both averred that they had received permission from the warden to claim the manure. But testimony revealed that neither had any authority from any town official in Stamford for the removal. Neither plaintiff while gathering, nor the defendant while removing the heaps was interfered with or opposed by any one. The removal of the manure was calculated to improve the appearance and health of the borough. The manure was worth one dollar per cart full, six dollars in all. The plaintiff, upon learning that the defendant had taken the manure, demanded he pay six dollars. Defendant refused the demand. Neither litigant owned any of the land adjacent to the road. On the above facts, the plaintiff prayed the court to rule that the manure was the personal property of the owners of the horses, and had been abandoned. By piling the manure into heaps, the plaintiff claimed ownership in trover. The only person who could reasonably have a greater claim to the manure would be the owner of the land in fee, and that barring any claim by the land owner, the plaintiff was the rightful owner. The defendant claimed that the manure being dropped and spread out over the surface of the earth was a part of the real estate, and belonged to the owner of the fee, subject to a public easement; that the fee was either the borough of Stamford or the town of Stamford, or in the parties who owned lands adjacent; that therefore the scraping up of the manure, mixed with the soil, if real estate, did not change its nature to that of personal estate, unless it was removed, whether the plaintiff had consent of the owner of the fee or not; and that unless the heaps become personal property, the plaintiff could not maintain his action. The defendant further claimed that the plaintiff may have, indeed, turned the manure into a personal estate by the act of piling it up; but had abandoned his claim to the manure by leaving it unattended overnight and into the next day. This inattention was an abandonment of all rights to ownership of the manure. The trial court ruled adversely, and found for the defendant. The plaintiff had no property rights in the piles of manure. The plaintiff appeals this ruling to this court. The case is appealed to this court, with the plaintiff seeking a new trial. ==Argument of the plaintiff-appellant== Curtis and Hoyt (Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant) offered the following arguments in their brief: (1) The manure in question was the personal property abandoned by its owners. (The owners of the horses.) Bla. Com-, 387, 4022 Kent Com. 356 (2) It never became a part of the real estate on which it was abandoned.2 Smith Lead. Cas., 252, 2581 Washb. R. Prop., bk. 1, ch.10 see 11 ¬ß 6Parsons v. Camp; 11 Conn., 525Needham v. Allison, 4 Frost., 355Plumer v. Plumer, 10 id., 558 (3) It being personal property abandoned by its owners, and lying upon the highway, and neither the owners of the fee nor the proper authorities of the town and borough having by any act of theirs shown any intention to appropriate the same, it became lawful for the plaintiff to gather it up and remove it from the highway, providing he did not commit a trespass, and removed it without objection from the owners of the land.Church v. Meeker, 34 Conn., 421 No trespass was in fact committed. No person was interfered with the plaintiff or made any objection. The court cannot presume a trespass to have been committed.1 Greenl. Ev., ¬ß 341 Swift Dig., 173 (4) But if the manure had become a part of the real estate, yet when it was gathered into heaps by the plaintiff it was severed from the realty and became personal estate.1 Swift Dig., 534Bouvier Law Dict., ‚ÄúReal Property.‚Äù And being gathered without molestation from any person owning or claiming to own the land, it is to be considered as having been taken by tacit consent of such owner.Martin v. Houghton, 45 Barb., 258 (5) The plaintiff therefore acquired not only a valid possession, but a title by occupancy, and by having expanded labor and money upon the property. Such a title is a good legal title against every person by the true owner. (6) If the plaintiff had a legal title then he had the constructive possession. If he had legal possession, and only left the property for a short time intending to return and take it away, then he might maintain an action against a wrong doer for taking it away.1 Swift Dig., 5301 Smith Lead. Cas., 473Bird V. Clark, 3 Day, 272Williams v. Dolbeare, id., 498Bulkeley v. Dolbeare, 7 Conn., 232Heath v. Milward, 2 Bing., N. C., 98 The leaving of property for a short time, intending to return, does not constitute an abandonment. The property is still to be considered as in the possession of the plaintiff. ==Argument of the defendant-respondent == Olmstead (Counsel for the defendant-respondent), contra. (1) The manure mixed with the dirt and ordinary scrapings of the highway, being spread out over the surface of the highway, was a part of the real estate, and belonged to the owner of the fee, subject to the public easement.1 Swift Dig. 107Emans v. Turnbull, 2 Johns., 322Fay v. Muzzey, 13 Gray, 53Goodrich v. Jones, 2 Hill, 142Daniels v. Pond, 2 Pick., 367Parsons v. Camp, 11 Conn. 5251 Wms. Exrs., 615 The defendant- respondent argued that abandoned horse manure had become a part of the real estate on which it was laid. (2) The scraping up of the manure and dirt into piles, if the same was a part of the real estate, did not change its nature to that of personal property, unless there was a severance of it from the realty by removal, (which there was not), whether the plaintiff had the consent of the owner of the fee or not, which consent it is conceded the plaintiff did not have. (3) Unless the scraping up of the heaps made their substance personal property, the plaintiff could not maintain his action either for trespass or trespass on the case. (4) In trespass de bonis asportatis, or trover, the plaintiff must have had the actual possession, or a right to the immediate possession, in order to recover.1 Hilliard on Torts, ch. 18 ¬ß 8 (5) If the manure was always personal estate, it being spread upon the surface of the earth, it was in possession of the owner of the fee, who was not the plaintiff.Church v. Meeker, ‚Äò04 Conn., 4321 Swift Dig., 107 The scraping of it into heaps, unless it was removed, would not change the possession from the owner of the fee to the plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore never had the possession. (6) If the heaps were personal property the plaintiff never had any right in the property, but only mere possession, if anything, which he abandoned by leaving the same upon the public highway from 8 o‚Äôclock in the evening until 12 o‚Äôclock the next day, without leaving any notice on or about the property, or any one to exercise control over the same in his behalf.2 Hilliard on Torts, ch. 18, ¬ß 19, note c,idem., ch. 18, ¬ß 14Church v. Meeker, idem. ==Opinion of the court == Opinion delivered by Judge Park. ==Holding == We therefore advise the Court of Common Pleas to grant a new trial. In this opinion the other judges concurred. ==Discussion == The Connecticut Court found the argument of the defendant-respondent to be exceptionally weak in terms of the law. The idea that horse droppings abandoned along the road became a part of the real estate in fee is an interesting argument. But it was soundly rejected by the court. Even following this theory, the borough of Stamford, Connecticut would have been the new best owners of the manure. When the plaintiff-appellate began to rake the manure into neat piles for reclamation, he did it in clear sight of one or more of the officials of Stamford. Also, presumably, any citizen of the town could have observed him. No one objected to his activity, or came forward to claim superior rights to the manure. The plaintiff had \\"improved\\" what was otherwise a nuisance to the town. In this act, he also had some legal standing to claim a superior ownership to anyone else. The existing laws allowing persons who piled up seaweed to have a legitimate claim of possession for 24 hours was invoked. The court had nothing good to say about the defendant-respondent, stating he had not placed himself in an enviable light. ==See also== *conversion (law) *trover *nuisance ==ReferencesExternal references== * Haslem v.

Adsorption of molecules on the nanorods can be detected through variation of the nanorods' properties, such as photoluminescence, electrical conductivity, vibration frequency, mass, etc. The simplest and thus most popular way is to pass electrical current through the nanorods and observe its changes upon exposure to gas.

It existed from 1881 to 1893, and again from 1978 to 1996. It was represented by four Members of Parliament. ==Population centres== The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the 1875‚Äì1876 election. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875‚Äì76 election). The number of MƒÅori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Waitotara, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries. The electorate was rural, in South Taranaki. It was based on the town of Waitotara, and is north of the city of Wanganui. Its original area was bounded by and in the west, in the north, and in the east. It bordered onto the South Taranaki Bight and went around the electorate. It included the towns of Patea, Pipiriki, Raetihi, and Ohakune. ==History== The electorate existed in the 19th century from 1881 to 1893. It was represented by John Bryce from 1881 to 1887, and then by George Hutchison from 1887 to 1893. In the 20th century the seat existed from 1978 to the introduction of MMP in 1996 and was represented by two National MPs. At the 1996 election, the bulk of the Waitotara electorate was merged with Wanganui to create the new electorate of Whanganui, and Peter Gresham was defeated by the Wanganui incumbent, Jill Pettis of the Labour Party. Gresham remained in Parliament as a list MP but retired in 1999. ===Members of Parliament=== Waitotara was represented by four Members of Parliament.

The building integrated the Cazier Science and Technology Library with a expansion, replacing the 74-year- old Merrill Library. The library is named for Milton R. Merrill, former Utah State University vice president, and Stanford Cazier, former Utah State University president. The original Merrill Library was built in 1930 by the Whitmeyer Company of Ogden, Utah and expanded in 1967. A second library, the Cazier Science and Technology Library, was added to campus in 1995. The Merrill‚ÄìCazier Library recently marked its 100th anniversary as a regional United States Government document depository. ==The Building== A central atrium connects the former Cazier Science and Technology library with the new construction allowing the two to work as one. The library is , about the same as the previous two libraries combined, using technological innovations, the new library is a more functional building. Recently labeled a \\"Smart Library\\" by Campus Technology magazine, the Merrill‚ÄìCazier Library offers a technology- rich environment with radio frequency identification tags (RFID), a self check-out system, an on site automated retrieval system, the Information Commons consisting of 150 computer workstations, group study rooms of which 14 are equipped with computers and large screen LCD displays, two multimedia suites, and two library instruction rooms with over 60 workstations. ==BARN== BARN as viewed from basement. An automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) is an integral part of the building and allows for many years of collection development. Designed and built by Daifuku of America at its North American Headquarters in Salt Lake City, the system is enclosed in a by and climate- controlled corner of the library building. Three aisles of shelves are served by three Storage and Retrieval Machines (SRMs) that can retrieve an average of 875 volumes a day. There is space to add a fourth row of shelves when it is needed. The BARN (Borrower's Automated Retrieval Network) was so named in reference to Utah State University's status as an agricultural school. All of the Merrill‚ÄìCazier Library's bound journals, over 200,000 less frequently used books, and most of the microform are stored in the BARN. There are currently nearly 550,000 items with room to expand to approximately 1.5 million items. ==References *Merrill-Cazier Library Category:Library buildings completed in 2005 Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States Category:Libraries in Utah Category:Federal depository libraries Category:Utah State University Category:Buildings and structures in Cache County, Utah Category:2005 establishments in Utah ","title":"Merrill‚ÄìCazier Library"},{"id":"20400036","text":"The Pickle Bridge line is a disused railway route in Northern England that ran between the cities of Huddersfield and Bradford.Joy, David. (1984). A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Vol. 8 South and West Yorkshire. ==HistoryWyke viaduct=== right The line was authorised in 1865 and amended 1873. Construction started in 1874. Wyke viaduct (locally known as Red Lion viaduct) was by far the largest engineering feature on the line, a 22 arch stone construction built by Hawkshaw & Meek. Unfortunately it was an unnecessary diversion around an unfriendly landowner across unsuitable ground. It suffered from subsidence due to local mine workings and a speed limit was imposed, followed by diversion of all passenger services in 1948 and complete closure of the line in 1952. The viaduct continued to deteriorate and British Rail applied for permission to partly demolish it, as by this time it was grade II listed. This permission was granted and the 14 arches at the northern end of the viaduct were demolished in 1987. Today, the viaduct is owned by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. ==The route== The line began at Anchor Pit Junction between and on what is now the Calder Valley line, but which was at that time the Manchester & Leeds Calder Valley main line and continued as follows: * Heading west and diverging north at Anchor Pit Junction. * Crossing the River Calder and swinging west to: * Clifton Road (Opened 1 March 1881, closed 14 September 1931, demolished 1934). * Heading north over a 5 arch viaduct at Thornhills and continuing north to: * (Opened 1 March 1881, closed 1917, burned down 1929). * Crossing over Wyke Viaduct (partly demolished 1987). * Swinging north east and joining the current Calder Valley line at Pickle Bridge junction between and Lightcliffe station. ==References== Category:Closed railway lines in Yorkshire and the Humber Category:Rail transport in West Yorkshire Category:Transport in Calderdale Category:Transport in the City of Bradford ","title":"Pickle Bridge line"},{"id":"20400043","text":"Thomas Sexton (1848‚Äì1932) was an Irish journalist, financial expert, nationalist politician and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1880 to 1896, representing four different constituencies.Maume, Patrick (1999): The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, \\"Who's Who\\" p.243, Gill & Macmillan, He was Lord Mayor of Dublin 1888‚Äì1889. ==Early life== He was born at Ballygannon, County Waterford, where he attended the local CBS school. Aged 12 he was the chosen from amongst several applicants to a position of clerk with the Waterford and Limerick Railway where he remained until 1867. Sexton took work from the Waterford News and other local papers; as well as forming a debating society. Moving to Dublin he joined The Nation newspaper becoming its leader-writer. In 1879 Sexton joined the Irish National Land League movement, and he became a member of the Parnellite Irish Parliamentary Party. ==Career== He was first elected MP for County Sligo in the 1880 general election, for South Sligo in the 1885 general election, then for Belfast West in the 1886 election and for North Kerry in the 1892 election. He was a cosigner of the No Rent Manifesto issued in 1881. He was regarded as one of the finest orators of the Irish Party, but handicapped by a querulous temperament. Following the party split over Parnell's leadership, he sided with John Dillon's anti- Parnellite faction, then in 1896 retired from parliamentary politics, disgusted at the bitter factionalism following the failure of the second Home Rule bill.In the House of Commons Information Office publication Appointments to the Chiltern Hundreds and Manor of Northstead Stewardships since 1850, Thomas Sexton is recorded as having taken the Chiltern Hundreds on 19 February 1895. However, this appears to be an error. The London Gazette lists him as having been returned for North Kerry at the general election in August 1895 (see London Gazette, Issue 26651 published on the 9 August 1895, and the writ for the by-election was moved in April 1896 (see House of Commons Debates 14 April 1896 vol 39 c882). The date of his resignation is therefore listed here as 19 February 1896, rather than 1895. Sexton was a member of the Committee, chaired by Hugh Childers, to enquire into the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland. In the report of the committee, published in 1896, he wrote a minority report showing that the tax burden on Ireland had been steadily increased throughout the nineteenth century, at the same time as its people were steadily impoverished.\\"Ireland's Financial Burthen\\", Auckland Star, 11 January 1897, p. 3 He was hostile to the Irish Land Acts (1903) on financial grounds, and regarded by William O'Brien as one of the principal players involved in his subsequent marginalisations from the Irish Party. Sexton continued to be a leading ally of Dillon as Chairman of the board of the Freeman's Journal from 1893 to 1911; however, his policy of cutting investments to maintain dividends led to the demise of the paper through William Martin Murphy's Irish Independent. ==Later life== After retiring from the Freeman's Journal he became Chairman of Boland's Mill, and during World War I denounced wartime taxation and in 1918 endorsed Sinn F√©in. At the end of his career he supported Fianna F√°il because it promised tariff protection for flour-milling. ==Notes== * ==External links== * Category:1848 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Freeman's Journal people Category:Irish journalists Category:Irish Parliamentary Party MPs Category:Anti-Parnellite MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Sligo constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Belfast constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) Category:UK MPs 1880‚Äì1885 Category:UK MPs 1885‚Äì1886 Category:UK MPs 1886‚Äì1892 Category:UK MPs 1892‚Äì1895 Category:UK MPs 1895‚Äì1900 Category:Lord Mayors of Dublin Category:People from Waterford (city) Category:Politicians from County Waterford Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Kerry constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) ","title":"Thomas Sexton (Irish politician)"},{"id":"20400055","text":"Chris Cuthbert (born September 20, 1957) is a Canadian play-by-play sportscaster for CBC Sports and Rogers Sports & Media's Sportsnet cable network. Formerly, he worked for TSN, NBC, and CBC Sports in a multitude of roles. He was lead play-by-play voice for Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for CTV, where he worked alongside Pierre McGuire. He also called the bronze medal match between Canada and the Czech Republic at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, alongside Ray Ferraro, as well as the gold medal match between Russia and Germany. ==BiographyCBC=== Cuthbert joined CBC Sports in 1984, where he anchored regional western games for Hockey Night in Canada, usually from Edmonton. He also got spot play-by-play work when the network's primary western broadcaster, Don Wittman, was covering other events for the network, or when the schedule load necessitated it. He got his big break during the 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs. On April 18, he was a reporter in Washington, providing brief and periodic reports of the Washington Capitals‚ÄìNew Jersey Devils game to the national CBC viewing audience watching the Canadian network's game broadcast from Montreal (the Canadiens against the Boston Bruins). A power outage struck the Montreal area, which ended the telecast from that city, and CBC was forced to turn to Cuthbert in Washington to provide the full broadcast ‚Äì play-by-play, analyst, and host. The broadcast was totally done off the cuff. In other words, there was no regular analysts, there were no graphics, or replay capabilities. His effort caught the network's attention, earned him a nomination for a Gemini Award, and launched a successful broadcasting career. Cuthbert rose to a sportscaster for CBC, where he called Olympic sports, figure skating, Canadian football, and NHL hockey. He became the secondary play-by-play voice of CFL on CBC behind Don Wittman in 1992 and eventually became the lead play-by-play voice, broadcasting the Grey Cup Championship each November from 1996 to 2004. His most notable work was Hockey Night in Canada (HNIC) games primarily involving the Montreal Canadiens or NHL teams from Western Canada. In the era of the CBC's Hockey Night in Canada double-headers, Cuthbert usually called the late games. He was assigned to a conference final every year in the play-by-play role from 1993 until 2004. Departure from CBC Cuthbert's contract was terminated by the CBC on February 24, 2005, by CBC Sports executive director Nancy Lee while the network endured the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout. There was much outrage over his firing, similar to that of Ron MacLean who had almost threatened to leave the network over stalled contract negotiations, as many believed he'd be the successor to Bob Cole. Some criticized Lee, who had created the position Manager of Program Acquisitions for CBC Sports to hire her friend Sue Prestedge a year earlier, despite the looming threat of the NHL lockout. It was also believed that Cuthbert's strong opposition, when CBC chose to drop its popular Hockey Day in Canada broadcast, did not endear himself to Lee. This decision was widely criticized, as rival network TSN staged a Hockey Day of its own. ===TSN and NBC=== After joining TSN in the spring of 2005, Cuthbert became TSN's lead CFL football voice, replacing TSN-original John Wells. Coincidentally, Cuthbert got his job at CBC in 1984 when Wells left the network to join the fledgling TSN. Since TSN gained the exclusive television rights to the CFL starting in 2008, Cuthbert has returned to his role as the primary voice of the CFL on TSN and calls every Grey Cup. Since joining TSN in 2005, he served as one of the network's hockey play-by-play voices. In the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 seasons, he also worked for NBC and usually worked alongside color commentator Peter McNab for both seasons. \\"Inside-the-Glass\\" reporter Cammi Granato joined the two for regional NHL broadcasts in 2005‚Äì06 season. Darren Pang later joined the two the following seasons. As a result of Rogers Media's acquisition of the national exclusive rights to the NHL in 2014, he became part of TSN's broadcasts of Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs regional games, as well as returning for NHL assignments on NBC and NBCSN, often calling the first two rounds of the playoffs. He made National Hockey League history on December 1, 2006 as the first play-by-play announcer in NHL history to intentionally broadcast a game from ice level, rather than a broadcast booth. Along with Glenn Healy, he called the Buffalo Sabres/New York Rangers game at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. According to The Globe and Mail, \\"it was a good show and it's unlikely to be the last.\\" 2010 Winter Olympics He was the lead play-by-play announcer for men's ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, including announcing the gold medal game between Canada and the United States. Just before Canada's Sidney Crosby scored the gold medal-winning goal seven minutes and forty seconds into overtime, Cuthbert said: He then later added: 2018 Winter Olympics Cuthbert returned to be the play-by-play announcer for men's ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang along with Ray Ferraro. ===CBC/Sportsnet=== In June 2020, Cuthbert moved from TSN to CBC/Sportsnet. He said that he made the change because he will be almost 70 years old by the time that Rogers/Sportsnet's national contract with the NHL expires in 2026, and there would be no guarantee that he would have another opportunity to call Hockey Night in Canada games again. ==Legacy== In 1998, Cuthbert won a Gemini Award for Best Sports Broadcaster, and in 2004, was recognized by Sports Media Canada as Sportscaster of the Year. In 2006, Cuthbert received another Gemini, this time with his TSN CFL analyst, Glen Suitor, for Best Sports Play-by-Play or Analyst. In 2014, Cuthbert was inducted into the media wing of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. A resident of Brampton, he is an inductee of the Brampton Sports Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Canadian television sportscasters Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:People from Brampton Category:Olympic Games broadcasters Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:National Hockey League broadcasters Category:Canadian Screen Award winning people Category:Living people Category:Figure skating commentators Category:Canadian Football League announcers Category:Canadian horse racing announcers Category:Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Chris Cuthbert"},{"id":"20400060","text":"Leonardo Cu√©llar Rivera (born 14 January 1954) is a Mexican football manager and former player who is the current manager of Am√©rica in the Liga MX Femenil.

He went to Palestine and became a pupil of Rabbi Yochanan, whose sayings he transmitted. He does not seem to have enjoyed high regard in Palestine, for it was taken as a matter of course that Rav Shimon ben Lakish should not do him the honor of addressing him in public.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 9b After a somewhat prolonged sojourn in Palestine he returned to Babylonia, residing both at Pumbedita and at Sura. In Pumbedita he at first refused to attend the lectures of Rav Judah ben Ezekiel,Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 148a but he soon became his friend, and was consulted by him in difficult cases.Babylonian Talmud Mo'ed Katan 17a Judah and his pupil Rabbah bar Nahmani once visited Rabbah, who was ill, and submitted a halakhic question to him. While they were there a Zoroastrian priest (\\"geber\\") suddenly appeared and extinguished the lamp, the day being a festival of Ormuzd, on which Jews were forbidden to have fire in their houses.Gr√§tz, \\"Gesch.\\" 2d ed., iv. 292 Rabbah thereupon sorrowfully exclaimed: \\"O God, let us live either under Thy protection, or at least under the protection of the children of Esau [the Romans]\\".Babylonian Talmud Gittin 16b‚Äì17a The persecutions of the Babylonian Jews by the Sassanids caused Rabbah to resolve to return to Palestine,Babylonian Talmud Pesahim 51a although it is nowhere said that he carried out that intention. During his residence at Sura he wished to introduce the recitation of the Ten Commandments into the daily prayer, but was dissuaded by Rav Chisda.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 12a Later he visited Ma·∏•oza, and he tells of the wonderful feats he saw performed there by a juggler.Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 73a, b ==Aggadic teachings== Some aggadic sayings by Rabbah bar bar Hana have been preserved. Citing , he compares the Torah to fire, in that as fire does not start of itself neither does the Law endure in solitary study.Babylonian Talmud Ta'anit 7a His interpretations of and Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 38a, 105a also are noteworthy; his saying that \\"the soul of one pious man is worth the whole world\\"Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 103b is especially memorable. ==Fantastic voyages== Rabbah bar bar Hana's stories of his marvelous experiences during his voyages and his journeys through the desert have become famous. These accounts may be divided into two groups. In the first group, he records his observations, generally beginning with the words \\"I have seen.\\" Among these are his remarks regarding the identity of the most fertile part of Palestine‚Äî\\"the land flowing with milk and honey\\";Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 111b‚Äì112a the distance between Jericho and Jerusalem;Babylonian Talmud Yoma 39b the area of the district in the plains of Moab mentioned in as the camp of the children of Israel;Babylonian Talmud Yoma 75b the castor-oil plant cultivated in Palestine, or the gourd of Jonah.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21a Here also belong his accounts of his relations with the Arabs, one of whom once used a term that explained to him the word in .Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 72b, 75a; Yevamot 120b; Rosh Hashanah 26b The second group includes his fantastic adventures on the sea and in the desert. In these stories, one of the most conspicuous figures is the Arab who was the guide of Rabbah and his companions on their journey through the desert. This Arab knew the route so well that he could tell from the odor of the sand when a spring was near.Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 73b The travelers passed through the desert in which the children of Israel wandered for forty years, and the Arab showed Mount Sinai to Rabbah, who heard the voice of God speaking from the mountain and regretting Israel's exile. The Arab likewise pointed out the place where Korah and his followers had been swallowed by the earth, and from the smoking abyss Rabbah heard the words, \\"Moses is truth and his teachings are truth, but we are liars\\".Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 74a He was shown the gigantic bodies of the Israelites who had died in the desert, lying face upward, and the place where heaven and earth almost touched, so that he could watch the rotation of the heavenly spheres around the earth in twenty-four hours. Rabbah's stories of his adventures on the sea resemble tales of other navigators concerning the immense size of various marine animals. As an example the following one may be cited: \\"Once, while on a ship, we came to a gigantic fish at rest, which we supposed to be an island, since there was sand on its back, in which grass was growing. We therefore landed, made a fire, and cooked our meal. But when the fish felt the heat he rolled over, and we would have drowned had not the ship been near\\". Here the resemblance to the later voyage of Sinbad the Sailor is obvious. The Talmud tells how his tales were received. In regard to one of them Rav Papa bar Samuel remarked, \\"Had I not been there I would not have believed it.\\" Rabbah's stories have called forth an entire literature; in addition to the numerous commentaries on the aggadahic portions of the Talmud that dwell by preference on these accounts, more than twenty essays interpreting and annotating them have appeared in various periodicals. ==Further reading== * The Juggler and the King, Aharon Feldman, (Philipp Feldheim, 1991). * ==External links== *◊ï÷∞◊†÷∂◊¢÷∂◊ú÷∞◊û÷∏◊î ◊û÷µ◊¢÷µ◊ô◊†÷µ◊ô ◊õ÷∏◊ú ◊ó÷∏◊ô (introductions, source material and explanations on the Aggadot), Tuvia Lipshitz ==References== Category:Talmud rabbis Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Rabbah bar bar Hana"},{"id":"20400182","text":"Palaeopagurus is an extinct genus of hermit crab from the Lower Cretaceous. ==References== Category:Hermit crabs Category:Cretaceous crustaceans Category:Prehistoric life of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 1925 ","title":"Palaeopagurus"},{"id":"20400188","text":"\\"Gin House Blues\\" is the title of two different blues songs, which have become confused over the years.

The main star is classified as a giant star with an orange tint. It is one of the stars given a Bayer designation by astronomer Johann Bayer. It was recorded in Bayer's 1603 publication Uranometria. In addition it is one of the main stars used in the visual formation of the Musca constellation. ==Distance and visibility== Based on research done by the European Space Agency for the Hipparcos Star Catalogue, Delta Muscae exhibits a parallax of 35.91 milliarcseconds. With this data, it can be calculated that Delta Muscae is situated at a distance of 27.8 parsecs, or 91.0 light years, from the sun. Even though Delta Muscae is the closest star to Earth in the Musca constellation, nearly 3800 stars are closer in proximity to the Earth as stated by the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars, which includes stars within twenty-five parsecs of the Sun. Delta Muscae is a star of the third magnitude (or 3.61(v) to be exact) when viewed from the Earth, and is visible to the naked eye in regions that lack dense light pollution. ==Stellar and system characteristics== Delta Muscae has a listed spectral type of K2III. The K2 portion of this designation specifies that Delta Muscae A is a class K2 star, meaning the light it emits is orange in color. The main star burns at a temperature cooler than the Sun, which is a G2 star. The second part of the classification, III, specifies that Delta Muscae is a giant star which has already left the main sequence of star life like the Sun. == References  External links == *NASA Exoplanet Archive results: HD 112985 *Del Mus Image Musca, Delta Category:Musca (constellation) Category:Spectroscopic binaries 063613 112985 4923 Category:Durchmusterung objects Category:K-type giants ","title":"Delta Muscae"},{"id":"20400308","text":"The Boardwalk Bullet is a wooden roller coaster at the Kemah Boardwalk amusement park in Kemah, Texas, United States.

Despite this, all sectors have 40 planets in them. There are four types of planets in the game: terran, industrial, mining, and farming. Terran planets on their own can produce industrial output (IO). Industrial output is what constitutes income in the game. The remaining types of planets can only produce IO by collectively forming what is called a commerce net. There are 15 classes of ships. Ships can travel inside or to an adjacent sector to perform missions. Ships have varying capabilities - cost, attack strength, defensive strength, speed, etc. - but the three main qualities of a ship are, hull size, whether they carry cargo or not, and what type of warp drive range they have. These qualities determine which type of mission or missions they are best suited for. Combat is resolved either by the game itself randomly calculating a result or allows an interface with The Cosmic Balance I, the tactical level space combat game preceding Cosmic Balance II. The interface between the two games is essentially manual. In this case, Cosmic Balance II lists the ship types involved in the battle, the type of Cosmic Balance I scenario which corresponds to the Cosmic Balance II mission being performed, and the tech levels of the combatants. The player(s) save their game, load Cosmic Balance I, set up the appropriate scenario in it, and complete a game. They then reload Cosmic Balance II and their saved game. Cosmic Balance II then asks for the results: ships destroyed, captured, or that ran away. These are entered and the game continues based on these entered results. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World stated that Cosmic Balance II \\"was too much like working on a balance sheet and watching the numbers change\\" and \\"Visicalc in space\\". It stated that the game was best played as a companion to its predecessor. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, the magazine gave the title and its predecessor three of five stars, writing that they \\"were excellent products in their day\\", and gave Imperium Galactum two stars, stating that \\"it simply lacked sufficient 'chrome' to make it enduring\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave Imperium Galactum one star. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of 4X video games ==External links== * a reproduction of the documentation for the game including map Category:1983 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Cosmic Balance II"},{"id":"20400507","text":"The Kalbasi family is known for its prominent Shia leaders, teachers in Islamic jurisprudence, and scholars. * Badri Kalbasi (1940- ), First woman to study Islamic Jurisprudence and Theology at the university. * Dr. Iran Kalbasi (1939- ) born in Isfahan, Iran.

NASA, JPL. In computer science, information science and systems engineering, ontology engineering is a field which studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies: formal representations of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. In a broader sense, this field also includes a knowledge construction of the domain using formal ontology representations such as OWL/RDF. A large-scale representation of abstract concepts such as actions, time, physical objects and beliefs would be an example of ontological engineering.http://ontology.buffalo.edu/bfo/BeyondConcepts.pdf Ontology engineering is one of the areas of applied ontology, and can be seen as an application of philosophical ontology. Core ideas and objectives of ontology engineering are also central in conceptual modeling. ==Overview== Automated processing of information not interpretable by software agents can be improved by adding rich semantics to the corresponding resources, such as video files. One of the approaches for the formal conceptualization of represented knowledge domains is the use of machine-interpretable ontologies, which provide structured data in, or based on, RDF, RDFS, and OWL. Ontology engineering is the design and creation of such ontologies, which can contain more than just the list of terms (controlled vocabulary); they contain terminological, assertional, and relational axioms to define concepts (classes), individuals, and roles (properties) (TBox, ABox, and RBox, respectively). Ontology engineering is a relatively new field of study concerning the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies,Asunci√≥n G√≥mez-P√©rez, Mariano Fern√°ndez-L√≥pez, Oscar Corcho (2004). Ontological Engineering: With Examples from the Areas of Knowledge Management, E-commerce and the Semantic Web. Springer, 2004. and the tool suites and languages that support them. A common way to provide the logical underpinning of ontologies is to formalize the axioms with description logics, which can then be translated to any serialization of RDF, such as RDF/XML or Turtle. Beyond the description logic axioms, ontologies might also contain SWRL rules. The concept definitions can be mapped to any kind of resource or resource segment in RDF, such as images, videos, and regions of interest, to annotate objects, persons, etc., and interlink them with related resources across knowledge bases, ontologies, and LOD datasets. This information, based on human experience and knowledge, is valuable for reasoners for the automated interpretation of sophisticated and ambiguous contents, such as the visual content of multimedia resources. Application areas of ontology-based reasoning include, but are not limited to, information retrieval, automated scene interpretation, and knowledge discovery. ==Ontology languages== An ontology language is a formal language used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based: * Common logic is ISO standard 24707, a specification for a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other. * The Cyc project has its own ontology language called CycL, based on first-order predicate calculus with some higher-order extensions. * The Gellish language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language. * IDEF5 is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies. * KIF is a syntax for first-order logic that is based on S-expressions. * Rule Interchange Format (RIF), F-Logic and its successor ObjectLogic combine ontologies and rules. * OWL is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from RDF and RDFS, as well as earlier ontology language projects including OIL, DAML and DAML+OIL. OWL is intended to be used over the World Wide Web, and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF resources, and identified by URIs. * OntoUML is a well-founded language for specifying reference ontologies. * SHACL (RDF SHapes Constraints Language) is a language for describing structure of RDF data. It can be used together with RDFS and OWL or it can be used independently from them. * XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) is a syntax for expressing business semantics. ==Ontology engineering in life sciences== Life sciences is flourishing with ontologies that biologists use to make sense of their experiments. For inferring correct conclusions from experiments, ontologies have to be structured optimally against the knowledge base they represent. The structure of an ontology needs to be changed continuously so that it is an accurate representation of the underlying domain. Recently, an automated method was introduced for engineering ontologies in life sciences such as Gene Ontology (GO), one of the most successful and widely used biomedical ontology. Based on information theory, it restructures ontologies so that the levels represent the desired specificity of the concepts. Similar information theoretic approaches have also been used for optimal partition of Gene Ontology. Given the mathematical nature of such engineering algorithms, these optimizations can be automated to produce a principled and scalable architecture to restructure ontologies such as GO. Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO), a 2006 initiative of the U.S. National Center for Biomedical Ontology, provides a common 'foundry' for various ontology initiatives, amongst which are: *The Generic Model Organism Project (GMOD) *Gene Ontology Consortium *Sequence Ontology *Ontology Lookup Service *The Plant Ontology Consortium *Standards and Ontologies for Functional Genomics and more ==Methodologies and tools for ontology engineering== * DOGMA * DogmaModeler * KAON * OntoClean * HOZO * Prot√©g√© (software) * Gra.fo (http://gra.fo) * TopBraid Composer * TopBraid EDG * HCOME: Human-centered collaborative ontology engineering methodology (http://semanticweb.org/wiki/SharedHCONE.html and HCOME-3O) == See also == * Ontology (information science) * Ontology double articulation * Ontology learning * Ontology modularization * Semantic decision table * Semantic integration * Semantic technology * Semantic Web * Linked data ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Kotis, K., A.

The river is host to the Ellinopygosteos fish (Pungitius hellenicus). According to ancient philosopher Herodotos, the river was called Dyras in ancient times. ==Geography== The Gorgopotamos rises 4 km north of Pavliani and west of Koumaritsi in the Oiti mountains with two streams. The river flows through a steep forested valley. It passes under OSE's Athens-Thessaloniki railway line and through the village Gorgopotamos, where it enters the plains. It empties into the river Spercheios near Ydromilos, 5 km southwest of Lamia. ==History== The railway bridge over the river is famous for one of the biggest sabotage acts of World War II, \\"Operation Harling\\". Operation Harling was a British mission and 150 Greek partisans blew it up on 25 November 1942, cutting off German supplies being transported between Athens and Thessaloniki (mostly headed for Africa). The blast destroyed two of the six piers of the bridge. The IV Railway Engineer Battalion, of the Railway Engineer Regiment of the Royal Italian Army repaired the bridge in 19 days, replacing the destroyed piers with the still existing steel girders. The area around the bridge is now a monument. The engineer who designed and built the original bridge was an Italian immigrant and Gorgopotamos local by the name of Agostino Tacconi, who used clever engineering at the time utilising unique parts making the bridge difficult to reconstruct in a timely manner. The British forces found this to be ideal as the Germans could not reconstruct it. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of rivers in Greece *Gorgopotamos Category:Landforms of Phthiotis Category:Rivers of Greece Category:Rivers of Central Greece Category:Drainage basins of the Aegean Sea ","title":"Gorgopotamos (river)"},{"id":"20400614","text":"Modiolus, the horsemussels, are a genus of medium-sized marine bivalve molluscs in the family Mytilidae. ==Fossil record== Fossils of species within this very ancient genus can be found in sediments from the Devonian period to recent (age range: 409.1 to 0.0 Ma).Fossilworks ==Species== Fossil of Modiolus species Species within the genus Modiolus include:WoRMS * Modiolus albicostus (Lamarck, 1819) * Modiolus americanus (Leach, 1815) \\\\- tulip mussel * Modiolus areolatus (Gould, 1850) * Modiolus auriculatus (Krauss, 1848) * Modiolus aurum Osorio Ruiz, 1979 * Modiolus barbatus (Linnaeus, 1758) \\\\- bearded horsemussel * Modiolus capax (Conrad, 1837) \\\\- fat horsemussel * Modiolus carpenteri (Soot-Ryen, 1963) \\\\- California horsemussel * Modiolus carvalhoi Klappenbach, 1966 * Modiolus cecillii (Philippi, 1847) * Modiolus comptus (Sowerby, 1915) * Modiolus demissus * Modiolus eiseni (Strong and Hertlein, 1937) \\\\- eisen horsemussel * Modiolus ficoides Macsotay & Campos, 2001 * Modiolus gallicus (Dautzenberg, 1895) * Modiolus gubernaculum (Dunker, 1856) * Modiolus kurilensis F.

The Foundation promotes dialogue on economic, security, political and social issues, fostering informed decision-making in the Canadian public, private and non-governmental sectors. APF Canada also provides grants to support policy research and informed discussion on Canada's relations with Asia. ==History of the Foundation== The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada was created as part of the Canadian government's growing interest in relations with Asia under the administrations of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Its inception in 1984 was led by the Department of External Affairs, and was specifically proposed by the director general of the Department's Asian and Pacific bureau, Tom Delworth. At the time the Department was headed by Secretary of State for External Affairs Joe Clark. Soon after, Vancouver businessman John Bruk was commissioned by the Department to undertake a study of the proposal. His report was accepted and became the basis for the founding Act. Mr. Bruk became the founding Chairman. The founders aimed to create an independent source of thought on Canada's trade, investment and political relations with Asia. This came amidst the growing perception of Canada as a Pacific country, compared with its relations being conducted primarily by the Eastern provinces across the Atlantic.Pierre Trudeau, \\"Canada and the World,\\" 29 May 1968, Canada, Department of External Affairs, Statements and Speeches, No. 68/17. As a result, it was mandated that the Foundation's primary office should always be in Vancouver, British Columbia as to promote relations with Asia across the Pacific. Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada Act This idea was the premise for the creation of the Asia‚ÄìPacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative, whose mission is to establish Canada's Asia‚ÄìPacific Gateway and Corridor as the best transportation network facilitating global supply chains between North America and Asia. The Foundation was initially funded on short-term plans or for specific projects with contributions from both the Federal and Provincial governments, as well as by corporate and private donors. In 2005 a founding supporter of the Foundation, Senator Jack Austin, led an initiative to award the Foundation a C$50-million endowment from the Government of Canada, from which it now draws much of its funding, in addition to private and corporate donations.http://www.international.gc.ca/about-a_propos/oig- big/2009/evaluation/apfc_fapc09.aspx?lang=eng Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada ==Mandate== The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) is a not-for-profit organization focused on Canada's relations with Asia. Its mission is to be Canada's catalyst for engagement with Asia and Asia's bridge to Canada. A leader in research and analysis on Canada-Asia relations for over 30 years, APF Canada partners with government, business leaders, academics, and opinion makers in Canada and across the Asia Pacific region to offer clear, specific, and actionable policy advice. APF Canada's thematic priorities include: promoting trade, investment, and innovation; advancing sustainability; building skills and competencies; and, understanding Asia now. ==Governance== The affairs of the Foundation are managed by a Board of Directors. The Board consists of a Chairperson and up to six other directors appointed by the Governor in Council; up to 18 additional directors appointed by the Board after consultation with provincial governments and other interested outside parties; and the President of the Foundation. The Chairperson and each of the Board members is appointed for a term of three years, and may serve a maximum of three terms. The Board, which has ultimate responsibility for the Foundation's activities, meets at least twice a year. It is responsible for setting the strategic directions of the Foundation, management of the endowment fund, and appointment of the President. Stewart Beck is the current President and CEO.

The nearest town is Yea. At the 2016 Census, the suburb of Murrindindi had a population of 107. ==Location and history== The name comes from the pastoral run begun by squatter Peter Snodgrass in 1837, which was originally (and probably correctly) spelled Murrundindi. In the Woiwurrung language of central Victoria the name means \\"living in the mountains\\". However, the inaccurate translation \\"mist of the mountains\\" is sometimes given. Snodgrass‚Äôs station covered the area from the present-day town of Yea up the valleys of the east and west branches of the Muddy Creek, now the Yea River. His homestead was near the junction of these two branches, therefore surveyors named the east branch Murrindindi Creek, now the Murrindindi River. There has never been a Murrindindi town. The gold rush town of Higinbotham (began 1868, lasted for a few years, now completely vanished) with a maximum of 200 residents was the nearest to a town that the valley has seen. Modern maps place the name Murrindindi at the site where the War Memorial Hall once stood (now a public reserve) or a little further to the south on Cummins Lane where the local volunteer fire station is situated. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries these would have been called Lower Murrindindi, and Upper Murrindindi was the locality now called Woodbourne and adjacent areas up the Ault Beag Creek. Ault Beag (Gaelic for \\"little creek\\") was named by an early Scots settler, Duncan McLeish. Farming and timber were the main industries of the area when the British settled the valley, and remain so today. Although much of the area was deforested by the timber industry, regrowth and sustainable logging techniques have restored the forests to some semblance of their former beauty, with management today as the Black Range State Forest. Tourism (trail-bike riding, fishing etc.) and sightseeing (rapids on the Murrindindi River, and the Wilhelmina Falls on a tributary) activities are carried on in the forest areas. ==Recent developments== Since the 1990s there has been a considerable growth in the number of vineyards in the valley, which is in the Upper Goulburn wine region of Victoria. These grow cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir and chardonnay grapes, primarily for wineries outside the area (and the grapes are usually labelled \\"Yea Valley\\"), but Cuthbertson‚Äòs Murrindindi and Sedona are two local vineyard/winery labels. On 7 February 2009 a fire started at the old abandoned Murrindindi timber mill which spread to become one of the major conflagrations known as Black Saturday. Although there were no human casualties at Murrindindi, many lives were lost further away at Marysville and Narbethong. ==References *Information on camping in Murrindindi Scenic Reserve (includes maps) group Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Murrindindi, Victoria"},{"id":"20401058","text":"Wasp was the fifth and final studio album released by teen idol Shaun Cassidy in 1980.

GPHS-RTG or general-purpose heat source ‚Äî radioisotope thermoelectric generator, is a specific design of the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) used on US space missions. The GPHS-RTG was used on Ulysses (1), Galileo (2), Cassini-Huygens (3), and New Horizons (1). The GPHS-RTG has an overall diameter of 0.422 m and a length of 1.14 m. Each GPHS-RTG has a mass of about 57 kg and generates about 300 Watts of electrical power at the start of mission (5.2 We/kg), using about 7.8 kg of Pu-238 which produces about 4,400 watts of thermal power.G. L. Bennett, Space Nuclear Power: Opening the Final Frontier, AIAA 2006-4191, 4th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference and Exhibit (IECEC), 26‚Äì29 June 2006, San Diego, California The plutonium oxide fuel is in 18 GPHSs. Note that the GPHS are cuboid although they contain cylindrical plutonium based pellets. The GPHS-RTG units used on spacecraft were not created by NASA. They were designed and built by General Electric Space Division (later part of Martin-Marietta, subsequently part of Lockheed Martin), in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The generators were filled with plutonium by Department of Energy laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio and Idaho Falls, Idaho. After the Ulysses and Galileo RTGs were fueled, their launches were postponed by four and three years respectively. As a result, the missions were slightly adapted to utilize the lower power that would be available.

The game supports the Wii Balance Board and features online multiplayer via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. ==Gameplay== In the game, players race against each other across four courses. Along the way, they can pick up weapons and power-ups such as mines, homing missiles, turbo boosts, invisibility and shields in order to hinder their opponents and aid themselves. Players can also use their board to protect themselves from attack. Each course features several alternate routes and hazards such as cliffs, but are linear and require the player to enter a teleportation portal at the bottom to warp them to the top of the course to start the next lap. Players will be able to choose from four characters, and be able to customize and upgrade their gear, giving them performance boosts. The game also features a time attack mode, two player split screen offline multiplayer and online multiplayer against up to four opponents, and an option to race without weapons or power-ups. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN criticized the game's \\"overly aggressive\\" rubberband AI and an unrewarding single player experience. Nintendo Life found that the reliance on using weapons to win rather than pure racing skill can result in a frustrating experience for the player. ==References *Snowboard Riot's Official Web Site * Category:Hudson Soft games Category:2009 video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii-only games Category:WiiWare games Category:Wii Wi-Fi games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Extreme sports video games Category:Snowboarding video games Category:Wii games ","title":"Snowboard Riot"},{"id":"20401298","text":"Deokhangsan is a mountain in the city of Samcheok, Gangwon-do in South Korea.

During his extensive career he played most notably for S.L. Benfica, from where he arrived in 1990 after spells at two other Portuguese clubs, C.D. Nacional and Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es. During his five-year spell, William helped Benfica to two Primeira Liga titles, forming an efficient partnership with compatriot Ricardo Gomes after arriving as a replacement for another Brazilian, Carlos Mozer. In the 1990‚Äì91 season he did not miss one single game for the champions, and still scored four goals. After one season in France at SC Bastia, William moved to Spain with SD Compostela, being fairly used during four years (although he was never an automatic first-choice), two in La Liga and two in the second division. He then returned to Portugal and Vit√≥ria Guimar√£es, already the bearer of a passport from the country, and retired after two slow years in June 2002, aged nearly 35. ==Coaching career== From December 2004 to May 2005 with SC Valenciano, and during one month in 2012 with Vilaverdense FC, William worked in the Portuguese third level. He subsequently had two spells with former club Compostela, who now competed in the regional championships. In 2016, William was named head coach of newly promoted Gibraltar Premier Division side Mons Calpe, appointing Gibraltar under-19 manager Terrence Jolley as his assistant and overseeing the arrivals of former professionals including Hugo Colace and Michele Di Piedi. On 17 January 2017, following a defeat against Glacis United, he was fired. After a brief return to the club in 2019, he was appointed manager of Lincoln Red Imps in May 2020.Club Statement - New Head Coach Appointed Lincoln Red Imps FC. 28 May 2020. 28 May 2020. ==Honours== Benfica *Primeira Liga: 1990‚Äì91, 1993‚Äì94 *Ta√ßa de Portugal: 1992‚Äì93 ==ReferencesCategory:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A players Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:C.D.

The invasion was performed by the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL) destroyer L√©opard on 28 November 1942, which toppled the administration loyal to the Vichy French regime and replaced it with a Free French administration. == Background  Vichy and R√©union === Since the Battle of France in May‚ÄìJune 1940, the island of La R√©union had had little strategic importance and little defences as a consequence. The Compi√®gne Armistice had reduced the military on the island to three officers, one doctor, eleven non-commissioned officers and about 270 men, of which only 23 were professionals. The coastal artillery was out of order. On 23 June 1940, Raoul Nativel, president of the conseil g√©n√©ral, denounced the Armistice on Radio Saint-Denis. The next day, British consul Maurice Gaud met with the governor of the island, Pierre Aubert, proposing to pay the French administration on British treasure if La R√©union would fight on. The proposal became public when Radio Mauritius broadcast it. Aubert consulted with local notabilities, but faced with the choice of illegally surrendering the island to a foreign government, he decided to stay loyal to Marshal Philippe P√©tain's Vichy France government. Supporters of the French exile government of Charles De Gaulle, General secretary Angelini and captain Plat were transferred, and the president of the colonial commission Adrien Lagourgue was discharged, as well as Nativel. Governor Aubert, although loyal to the Vichy Regime, was relatively moderate in his support of P√©tain's policies. He had, however, the supreme authority on the island. On the other hand, his cabinet director, Jean-Jacques Pillet, was enthusiastic in his support of the Vichy R√©volution nationale, organising censorship, propaganda, a special criminal court, and a pro-Vichy militia. A local resistance movement soon emerged. On 11 November 1941, for Remembrance Day, about 20 women put flowers on the 1918 memorial at Saint-Denis; they were consequently fined. Communist cells operated under L√©on de Lepervanche though kept a low profile. La R√©union also harboured Duy T√¢n, exiled Emperor of Vietnam, who was a keen radio amateur and managed to communicate with Mauritius; he was detained shortly thereafter and had his equipment confiscated. === Strategic situation === After the Battle of Singapore, in February 1942, the British Eastern Fleet retreated to Addu Atoll in the Maldives. Then, following Chuichi Nagumo's Indian Ocean raid in early 1942, the Fleet moved its operational base to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, increasing the British presence on the Eastern African coasts. Soon afterwards, the British struck the French possessions of Madagascar, under Vichy Regime control, with Operation Ironclad, on 5 May 1942. La R√©union lost her shipping communications with mainland Africa, and the attack further encouraged anti-British sentiments among the Vichy loyalists. On the other hand, De Gaulle, who had not been involved in Ironclad, felt hard-pressed to re-claim La R√©union from Vichy before the British or Americans would. On 8 May, Vichy elements in Madagascar signaled that a British cruiser had left South Africa with 600 men aboard to seize the island. Aubert then decided to obstruct the harbour of Le Port by scuttling a ship in the entrance. He also ordered evacuation of the capital of Saint-Denis, so as to avoid a bloody bombing like that at Diego Soares; in the evening, about 9,000 people had moved to La Montagne, Le Br√ªl√©, Saint-Fran√ßois, and Sainte Marie. No bombing materialised, however, and the population gradually returned to its homes. The incident had highlighted the fact that the island was helpless against any invasion; on 18 September, it was decided that resistance to a landing would be limited to a mere token fight. Some elements of the military were however determined to fiercely resist a British invasion. On 27 September, Saint-Denis was declared open city, while authorities moved to Hell-Bourg, mocked by De Gaulle's supporters. On 8 November, Operation Torch triggered Case Anton, the German invasion of the so-called \\"Free Zone\\", resulting in the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. Fran√ßois Darlan emerged as a rival to De Gaulle, negotiating with General Mark Clark. == Invasion == The L√©opard, pictured in 1942 On the night of 26 to 27 November 1942, the FNFL large destroyer L√©opard sailed with 74 troops from Mauritius, arriving off Saint-Denis on 27 at 23:00. She was captained by commander Jules Evenou, who went by the nom de guerre of \\"Jacques Richard\\". Two launches were sent with a 5-man party to search for a favourable landing spot. At 2:30, L√©opard was sighted by lookouts, as the invasion troops were boarding boats. About 60 men landed and, led by Lieutenant Moreau, took control of the government palace, and the rest of Saint-Denis was under Free France control by the evening. Barraquin, chief of the invasion troops, made contact with friendly elements in the population, notably Communist leader L√©on de L√©pervanche, and General secretary Rivi√®re, who started arranging the hand-over of the island. Hard-core Vichyist Pillet then fled to Hell-Bourg to organise a resistance. The new governor designated by De Gaulle, Andr√© Capagorry, arrived around 6 o'clock, cheered by the population, and gave a speech calling for calm on Radio Saint-Denis. Charles de Gaulle inspecting sailors on the L√©opard in June 1942 The next day, on 28 November, Communist cells under L√©pervanche activated, seizing the city hall, arresting the mayor and electing L√©pervanche as leader of a \\"Committee of Public Safety\\"; they next failed in an attempt to capture the 95-mm coastal battery of Le Port, commanded by Lieutenant √âmile Hugot, considered a hard- core P√©tainist. In retaliation, the battery opened fire on L√©opard, which retreated to the open sea and started firing back, killing two. Engineer Raymond Decugis attempted to have the battery cease-fire but was killed by small arms fire. A sortie by the Vichyists was thwarted by small arms fire from the Resistants, severely wounding Hugot. Fearing an assault of their positions by regular troops, the gunners retreated, silencing the battery, and L√©opard approached Le Port. Upon learning that the invasion force was French rather than British, and without any response from his government in spite of repeated requests for instructions, Aubert renounced the idea of even a symbolic fight. However, Captain Evenou, growing increasingly nervous at the thought of enemy submarines and fearing for his ship, clumsily attempted to force the issue by threatening to destroy factories on the island. After lengthy negotiations involving Capagorry, Aubert eventually agreed to surrender on the condition that the ultimatum on the factories be made again as a way for him to save face. The surrender was formalised on 30 at 8:45. Capagorry broadcast the statements: == Aftermath == Banknote issued by Free French R√©union in 1943 On 2 December, Pillet, local army commander Artignan, and their wives were discreetly brought aboard L√©opard as to avoid any popular retaliation. Aubert boarded the next day after lunch with Capagorry, Evenou and Barraquin, and the destroyer departed for Mauritius. L√©opard made several trips between Mauritius and La R√©union to provide rice, which had been lacking, contributing greatly to Capagorry's popularity. He gained the nickname papa de riz or the \\"rice daddy\\". From 20 April 1943, a special court cancelled all sanctions and discharges imposed under the Vichy Regime. Officials of the Vichy administration suffered at most light penalties, except for Jean-Jacques Pillet, who was discharged. In recognition of his role in the battle, Raymond Decugis was later declared a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and a Companion of the Liberation. == See also == * Battle of Madagascar * French Somaliland in World War II * History of R√©union == Sources and references  Further reading == * * == External links == * Le jour du L√©opard * La R√©union et le r√©gime de Vichy (2e partie) * CAPAGORRY ET LE RALLIEMENT DE LA R√âUNION √Ä LA FRANCE LIBRE Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Conflicts in 1942 Category:Military battles of Vichy France Category:Battles of World War II involving France Category:African theatres of World War II Battle Category:1942 in R√©union ","title":"Battle of R√©union"},{"id":"20401801","text":"Glomerulonephrosis is a non-inflammatory disease of the kidney (nephrosis) presenting primarily in the glomerulus (a glomerulopathy).

The fountain honors the controversial James Scott, who left $200,000 to the City of Detroit for a fountain in tribute to himself. ==History== Scott was left a sizable fortune by his father who invested in Detroit real estate.Austin, Dan. According to contemporaries, Scott gambled and told off-color stories. He was described by twentieth-century author W. Hawkins Ferry as a \\"vindictive, scurrilous misanthrope\\" P. 44. who attempted to intimidate his business competitors and when this was unsuccessful, he filed suit. Perhaps for these reasons, Scott died in 1910 with no heirs or colleagues and he bequeathed his estate to the City of Detroit with the condition that the fountain include a life-sized bronze statue of him. P. 78. Some accounts state that the will required that the statue be at the fountain's pinnacle. Several community and religious leaders‚Äîincluding Bishop Charles D. Williams‚Äîspoke against accepting the bequest, saying that a person with Scott's reputation should not be immortalized in the city. Mayor Philip Breitmeyer and City Council President David Heineman urged accepting the gift, saying that the city shouldn't insult any of its citizens by refusing such a generous offer. While the debate raged, Scott's fortune continued to grow, topping $1 million by the time construction commenced. == Design == The monument is located in Belle Isle Park, in Detroit, Michigan. Designed by architect Cass Gilbert and sculptor Herbert Adams, the marble fountain was completed in 1925 at a cost of $500,000. The lower bowl has a diameter of and the central spray reaches .

He is left catatonic in a hospital following the incident. The fountain is also featured briefly in Anthony Mann's 1947 film noir T-Men, photographed by John Alton.

Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co., 405 U.S. 233 (1972), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may act against a company's ‚Äúunfair‚Äù business practices even though the practice is none of the following: an antitrust violation, an incipient antitrust violation, a violation of the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of the antitrust laws, or a deceptive practice.. This legal theory is termed the \\"unfairness doctrine.\\" == Background == The Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co. (S&H;) was in the business of issuing and \\"redeeming\\" S&H; trading stamps. As explained in the Court's opinion, trading stamps are a form of ‚Äúscrip.‚Äù They can be used to purchase goods but only at a designated ‚Äústore.‚Äù S&H; sold the stamps to merchants, such as supermarket chains, which then ‚Äúgave‚Äù the stamps to their customers, typically at the rate of one stamp for each ten cents' worth of purchases. The customers were instructed to paste the S&H; stamps into booklets, and when they had accumulated enough booklets full of S&H; stamps they could ‚Äúredeem‚Äù them at an S&H; redemption center for ‚Äúgifts‚Äù‚Äîmerchandise, such as golf clubs or blenders. S&H; accounted for 40% of the US trading stamp business and more than 60% of US consumers saved S&H; stamps; the industry annually issued 400 billion stamps to more than 200,000 stores, and they were distributed to the public in connection with retail sales of $40 billion. S&H; placed restrictive notices in the booklets, advising consumers that they did not own the stamps, that their only right was to paste the stamps into the booklets and redeem booklets at an S&H; redemption center, and that they could not buy, sell, or swap stamps.A notice on the inside cover of each booklet read: > Neither the stamps nor the books are sold to merchants, collectors or any > other persons, at all times the title thereto being expressly reserved in > the Company. . . . The stamps are issued to you as evidence of cash payment > to the merchants issuing the same. The only right which you acquire in said > stamps is to paste them in books like this and present them to us for > redemption. You must not dispose of them or make any further use of them > without our consent in writing. . . . [I]f the stamps or the books are > transferred without our consent, we reserve the right to restrain their use > by, or take them from other parties. It is to your interest that you fill > the book, and personally derive the benefits and advantages of redeeming it. Other trading stamp companies (such as Gold Bond) operated on a similar basis. S&H; enforced the restrictions by suing merchants who ‚Äútrafficked‚Äù in S&H; stamps, for example, by accepting them in partial payment for merchandise. S&H; also sued ‚Äútrading stamp exchanges,‚Äù which were businesses that permitted consumers, for a fee, to swap one kind of stamp for another, in order to consolidate the consumers‚Äô stamp holdings into one brand and thus more rapidly redeem their stamp holdings. Some consumers, the Court noted, ‚Äúmay seek to sell [their] stamps in order to use the resulting cash to make more basic purchases (food, shoes, etc.) than redemption centers normally provide.‚Äù S&H; attempted to suppress all such ‚Äútrafficking.‚ÄùThe Court noted: > Between 1957 and 1965, by its own account, the company filed for 43 > injunctions against merchants who redeemed or exchanged its stamps without > authorization, and it sent letters threatening legal action to 140 stamp > exchanges and 175 businesses that redeemed S&H; stamps. In almost all > instances, the threat or the reality of suit forced the businessmen to > abandon their unauthorized practices. The FTC sued S&H; for this practice (among others) on the ground that this was unfair and oppressive to consumers. After administrative hearings, the FTC ordered S&H; to stop interfering with consumers and trading stamp ‚Äútraffickers‚Äù by trying to ‚Äúsuppress the operation of trading stamp exchanges and other ‚Äòfree and open‚Äô redemption of stamps.‚Äù ==JudgmentCourt of Appeals=== S&H; appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which reversed the FTC‚Äôs order because section 5 of the FTC Act,Section 5 provides: ‚ÄúThe Commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations . . . from using unfair methods of competition in commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.‚Äù 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 45(a)(6). under which the FTC had proceeded, ‚Äúempowers the Commission to restrain only such practices as are either in violation of the antitrust laws, deceptive, or repugnant to public morals.‚Äù The Fifth Circuit added that the FTC could declare ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and prohibit only antitrust violations or violations of the spirit of the antitrust laws. ===Supreme Court=== The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Fifth Circuit. After reviewing the legislative history of the statute and the case law, the Court held that ==Significance== The FTC has occasionally invoked the unfairness doctrine against practices that did not readily fit into existing antitrust or deceptive practices categories, but until recently has not brought many such cases. Currently, however, the FTC has been using the unfairness doctrine against use of spyware.

The film was produced by Melanie Coombs and Melodrama Pictures with music by Dale Cornelius. The voice cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette, Eric Bana and Bethany Whitmore, with narration provided by Barry Humphries. The film follows the relationship between a lonely Australian girl, Mary, and her American pen-pal, Max, a morbidly obese man with Asperger's syndrome. The film is inspired Elliot's relationship with his pen- friend in New York who he's been writing to for over twenty years. The film premiered on the opening night of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival on January 15, 2009. The film won the Annecy Cristal in June 2009 from the Annecy International Animated Film Festival and Best Animated Feature Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in November 2009. The film was theatrically released on April 9, 2009, by Icon Entertainment International, it received acclaim from critics and earned US$1.7 million on an $8.2 million AUD budget. ==Plot== In 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (Bethany Whitmore) lives a lonely life in Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia. At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead; while at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened condensed milk; and a Smurfs-like cartoon show called The Noblets. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a New York City telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz's name from the phone book and writes him a letter telling him about herself, sending it off in the hope that he will become her pen pal. Max Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese 44-year-old Jewish atheist who has trouble forming close bonds with other people, due to various mental and social problems. Though Mary's letter initially gives him an anxiety attack, he decides to write back to her, and the two quickly become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and The Noblets). Due to Vera's disapproval of Max, Mary tells him to send his letters to her agoraphobic neighbour, Len Hislop, whose mail she collects regularly. When Mary later asks Max about love, he suffers a severe anxiety attack and is institutionalized for eight months. After his release, he is hesitant to write to Mary again for some time. On his 48th birthday, he wins the New York Lottery, using his winnings to buy a lifetime supply of chocolate and an entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the rest of his money to his elderly neighbour Ivy, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying in an accident with a malfunctioning jet pack. Meanwhile, Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her. On the advice of his therapist, Max finally writes back to Mary and explains he has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Mary is thrilled to hear from him again, and the two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires from his job at a tea bag factory, he takes up metal detecting, but is soon swept away (and presumably killed) by a big tidal bore while on a beach. Mary (Toni Collette) goes to the University of Melbourne and has her birthmark surgically removed, and develops a crush on her Greek Australian neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos (Eric Bana). Drunk and guilt-ridden over her husband's death, Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks embalming fluid (which she mistook for cooking sherry). Mary and Damien grow closer following Vera's death and are later married. Inspired by her friendship with Max, Mary studies psychology at university, writing her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her test subject. She plans to have her dissertation published as a book; but when Max receives a copy from her, he is infuriated that she has taken advantage of his condition, which he sees as an integral part of his personality and not a disability that needs to be cured. He breaks off communication with Mary (by removing the letter \\"M\\" from his typewriter), who, heartbroken, has the entire run of her book pulped, effectively ending her budding career. She sinks into depression and begins drinking cooking sherry, as her mother had done. While searching through a cabinet, she finds a can of condensed milk, and sends it to Max as an apology. She checks the post daily for a response and one day finds a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her for his own pen friend, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand. Meanwhile, after an incident in which he nearly chokes a homeless man (Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum) in anger, for throwing away a used cigarette, Max realizes Mary is an imperfect human being, like himself, and sends her a package containing his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary, however, has sunken into despair after Damien's departure, and fails to find the package on her doorstep for several days. Finding some Valium that had belonged to her mother, and unaware that she is pregnant with Damien's child, Mary decides to commit suicide. As she takes the Valium and is on the verge of hanging herself, Len knocks on her door, having conquered his agoraphobia to alert her of Max's package. Inside, she finds the Noblet figurines and a letter from Max, in which he tells her of his realization that they are not perfect and expresses his forgiveness. He also states how much their friendship means to him, and that he hopes their paths will cross one day. One year later, Mary travels to New York with her infant child to finally visit Max. Entering his apartment, Mary discovers Max on his couch, gazing upward with a smile on his face, having died earlier that morning. Looking around the apartment, Mary is awestruck to find all the letters she had sent to Max over the years, laminated and taped to the ceiling. Realizing Max had been gazing at the letters when he died, and seeing how much he had valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy and joins him on the couch. ==Cast== * Barry Humphries as the Narrator * Toni Collette as Mary Daisy Dinkle * Bethany Whitmore as Young Mary * Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max Jerry Horowitz * Eric Bana as Damien Popodopoulos * Ren√©e Geyer as Vera Lorraine Dinkle * Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum as Homeless Man * Michael Ienna as Lincoln (uncredited) * Julie Forsyth, John Flaus, Christopher Massey, Shaun Patten, Leanne Smith and Carolyn Shakespeare-Allen as additional voices ==ProductionDevelopment=== According to the opening credits, the film is based on a true story. In an interview given in April 2009, writer-director Elliot clarified that the character of Max was inspired by \\"a pen-friend in New York who I've been writing to for over twenty years.\\" Principal photography lasted over 57 weeks, using 133 separate sets, 212 puppets, and 475 miniature props, \\"including a fully functioning Underwood typewriter which apparently took nine weeks to design and build.\\" ===Themes=== The film deals with themes including childhood neglect, friendship, addiction, alcoholism, recovery, the obscurity of life, teasing, loneliness, mental illness, autism (Asperger syndrome in particular), obesity, suicide, depression, isolation, and anxiety. ==Music== The music in the film features Simon Jeffes and the Penguin Cafe Orchestra's \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" (the opening theme) and \\"Prelude and Yodel\\", as well as \\"Russian Rag\\" by Elena Kats-Chernin. The closing- credits music is \\"A Swingin' Safari\\" by Bert Kaempfert and his Orchestra. Other artists include Nana Mouskouri, Dale Cornelius, Leroy Anderson, Pink Martini, London Pops Orchestra, James Last and his Orchestra, The King's Consort and Choir, the Sydney Alpha Ensemble, and the ABC Radio Orchestra. This film also includes the Pink Martini version of Doris Day's most well- known song, \\"Que Sera Sera\\", which is played over Mary's attempted suicide scene. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Mary and Max received very positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval score of 95% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.11/10. The consensus reads, \\"Mary and Max is a lovingly crafted, startlingly inventive piece of animation whose technical craft is equaled by its emotional resonance.\\" Matt Ravier, writing for In Film Australia, said the \\"story is paper-thin and some stretches of it are simply too long, yet whenever the narrative thread threatens to tear the sheer authenticity and bold honesty of the characters save the day\\". The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"remarkable and poignant\\" film depicting a \\"film noir world of blacks, whites and grays for Max and a sepia suburbia for Mary\\". After the film was released on DVD in the United States, Slant said \\"Adam Elliot's dry wit is pervasive throughout Mary and Max and it's nice to see that this unique sense of humor extends to the extras. The writer-director gives a funny and informative audio commentary and a set of hilarious making-of episodes reflects the sardonic tone of the production. The big prize here, however, is the addition of Elliot's Oscar-winning short Harvie Krumpet. This Geoffrey Rush-narrated tale of the titular Tourette syndrome sufferer is a wonderful introduction both to Elliot's sensibilities and to Mary and Maxs specific tone.\\" ===Box office=== Mary and Max grossed $1,444,617 at the Australian box office..

This white, malodorous solid is a reagent widely used in organic synthesis. Abbreviated TsCl or TosCl, it is a derivative of toluene and contains a sulfonyl chloride (‚àíSO2Cl) functional group. ==Uses== In characteristic manner, TsCl converts alcohols (abbreviated ROH) into the corresponding toluenesulfonate esters, or tosyl derivatives (\\"tosylates\\"): : CH3C6H4SO2Cl + ROH ‚Üí CH3C6H4SO2OR + HCl Tosylates can be cleaved with lithium aluminium hydride: : 4 CH3C6H4SO2OR + LiAlH4 ‚Üí LiAl(O3SC6H4CH3)4 \\\\+ 4 RH Thus, tosylation followed by reduction allows for removal of a hydroxyl group. Likewise, TsCl is used to prepare sulfonamides from amines: :CH3C6H4SO2Cl + R2NH ‚Üí CH3C6H4SO2NR2 \\\\+ HCl The resulting sulfonamides are non-basic and, when derived from primary amines, are even acidic. TsCl reacts with hydrazine to give p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The preparation of tosyl esters and amides are conducted in the presence of a base, which absorbs hydrogen chloride. The selection of the base is often crucial to the efficiency of tosylation. Typical bases include pyridine and triethylamine. Unusual bases are also used; for example, catalytic amounts of trimethylammonium chloride in the presence of triethylamine is highly effective by virtue of the trimethylamine. ==Other reactions== Being a widely available reagent, TsCl has been heavily examined from the perspective of reactivity. It is used in dehydrations to make nitriles, isocyanides and diimides. In an unusual reaction focusing on the sulfur center, zinc reduces TsCl to the sulfinate, CH3C6H4SO2Na. ==Manufacture== This reagent is inexpensively available for laboratory use.

The Hawkeyes had only lost one game all year and it was to their rival Iowa State. Iowa opened the play up with a bang and set an Orange Bowl record when C.J. Jones returned the opening kickoff of the game 100 yards for a touchdown. USC responded with a touchdown run on from running back Justin Fargas. Iowa regained the lead with a field goal from Nate Kaeding. USC would kick a field goal in the second quarter to even the score 10-10 at the half. USC came out in the second half and separated themselves from Iowa scoring twice in the third quarter to take a 24-10 lead. The first score was a pass from Palmer to Mike Williams and the second was another run from Fargas. USC ended the third quarter with the ball and scored quickly in the fourth quarter giving them a 31-10 lead.

Iowa would score off a touchdown pass from Banks however it was too late. USC would end up winning 38-17. The Trojans dominated time of possession in the game, having control of the ball for 38:06 seconds. This allowed for the Trojans defense to rest while keeping the Iowa defense out on the field and making them tired. USC's defense did not give up a touchdown to Iowa until the fourth quarter of the game and forced Banks to throw his first interception since October 19.http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=230020030 ==2002 team players in the NFL== *Marcell Allmond *Kevin Arbet *Collin Ashton *Darnell Bing *William Buchanon *Dominique Byrd *Matt Cassel *Shaun Cody *Keary Colbert *Justin Fargas *Matt Grootegoed *Gregg Guenther *Alex Holmes *Norm Katnik *Kareem Kelly *Ryan Killeen *David Kirtman *Winston Justice *Jason Leach *Matt Leinart *Oscar Lua *Malaefou MacKenzie *Tom Malone *Grant Mattos *Fred Matua *Chris McFoy *Sultan McCullough *Jason Mitchell *Carson Palmer *Mike Patterson *Troy Polamalu *LaJuan Ramsey *Bernard Riley *Jacob Rogers *Frostee Rucker *Dallas Sartz *Lofa Tatupu *Kenechi Udeze *Lenny Vandermade *John Walker *Lee Webb *Kyle Williams *Mike Williams *Manuel Wright *Justin Wyatt ==References== USC Category:USC Trojans football seasons Category:Pac-12 Conference football champion seasons Category:Orange Bowl champion seasons ","title":"2002 USC Trojans football team"},{"id":"20402064","text":"Joseph Kalang Tie (born 9 March 1987) is a Malaysian footballer who plays for Kuching in the Malaysia Premier League and the Malaysia national teamhttps://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players- coaches/people=390483/index.html.

They represent the longest running series in German philately and are in their many variations and derivations an essential part of German philatelic collections. ==Design== The initial issue from January 1, 1900, replaced the standard issue depicting numbers and eagles. The image of Germania, rather than that of the ruling monarch as was customary in many other European monarchies, made it a unifying feature and did not complicate the relationship with other German royalty and the coexisting German postal authorities of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. The engraving was performed by Paul Eduard Waldraff (1870‚Äì1917) who used the actress Anna F√ºhring as model.Background of the Germania stamps (in German) Wearing an octagonal imperial crown she is holding a sword and an olive branch. The Jugendstil design depicting F√ºhring was personally chosen by the emperor Wilhelm II. Selection process of design (German) ==Issues inside Germany== The Germania stamp has many issues and variations. The 1900 issue is inscribed \\"Reichspost\\", all issues after April 1, 1902, carry the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" (German Empire) inscription. All issues after 1902 have watermarks. Within Germany Germania stamps were issued as follows: ===German Empire=== Use of Germania stamp in Bavaria, 1919 * 1900, January 1: Reichspost, German Empire, excluding Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg * 1902, April 1, Deutsches Reich, including W√ºrttemberg * 1905-11, Deutsches Reich * 1915-17, Deutsches Reich, war printings * 1916-19, Deutsches Reich, background without engraving lines ===Weimar Republic=== * 1919, May 1: Deutsches Reich, semipostal with surcharge for war veterans, * 1919: Bavaria only: \\"Freistaat Bayern\\" overprint, * 1920: Deutsches Reich, including Bavaria, * 1921: Deutsches Reich, overprinted values, * 1922, March: Deutsches Reich, last issue (75 Pfennig and 1 Mark). ===Disputed areas=== * 1920: Saargebiet, overprinted,Michel, page 563 * 1922: Plebiscite areas of Allenstein and Marienwerder, overprinted,Michel, pages 422ff * 1920: Memelland, overprinted.Michel, page 529 ==Issues outside Germany== 1905 Germania stamp, issued in China Overprinted Germania stamps were used outside Germany. Prior to World War I they were released by German post offices abroad in a number of foreign countries, namely China, Morocco, and Turkey.Michel, pages 365ff. During the First World War Germania stamps were released in occupied areas, namely in Belgium, France, \\"Postgebiet (des) Ob(erbefehlshabers) Ost\\" (eastern postal territory), \\"Russian Poland\\", \\"General-Gouvernement Warschau\\", and Romania.Michel, pages 606ff. After the war, the stamps were also initially used with overprints in Danzig.Michel, pages 456ff Further, Polish postal authorities, Poczta Polska, also initially utilized overprinted Germania stamps. One of the rarer German stamps is the Vineta provisional, a halved and overprinted Germania stamp that was issued by the cruiser SMS Vineta in 1901. Germania stamps were not issued in the German colonies, instead in those territories the Yacht issue was released first in 1900 with the appropriate identifying inscriptions. ==Postal stationeries== 5 Pfennig postcard, sent from Leipzig to Zoppot (now Sopot in Poland) on 15 June 1905. 7¬Ω Pfennig postcard with Ob. Ost overprint, sent from Libau (now LiepƒÅja in Latvia) to Berlin on 4 December 1917. The rectangular stamp is a censor mark from K√∂nigsberg. From 1900 onwards the Deutsche Reichspost issued several postal stationeries with imprinted Germania stamps.For an overview, see the Michel Ganzsachen-Katalog Deutschland. The most common one is a ‚ÄòPostkarte‚Äô (postcard) with an imprinted 5 Pfennig stamp. In 1916 the German government introduced a tax on the postal traffic, the Reichsabgabe. This involved a raising of the postal rates and the 5 Pfennig postcard was replaced by a 7¬Ω Pfennig postcard. In 1918 the Reichsabgabe was raised. Now the 10 Pfennig postcard for international mail had to be used for domestic mail too. Postal stationeries with imprinted Germania stamps have been overprinted for the use in a.o.: * Allenstein (overprint ‚ÄòPl√©biscite Olsztyn Allenstein‚Äô); * Bavaria (overprint ‚ÄòFreistaat Bayern‚Äô); * Occupied Belgium (overprint ‚ÄòBelgien‚Äô and value in Belgian francs); * The Free City of Danzig (overprint ‚ÄòDanzig‚Äô); * The Memel Territory (overprint ‚ÄòMemelgebiet‚Äô); * Occupied Poland (overprints ‚ÄòRussisch Polen‚Äô and ‚ÄòGen.-Gouv.

In short, the postal stationeries with imprinted Germania stamps were almost as widely used as the stamps themselves. ==See also== * Postage stamps and postal history of Germany * Michel catalog * Scott catalog ==References External links == * Arbeitsgemeinschaft Germania-Briefmarken Category:Postage stamps Category:Philately of Germany ","title":"Germania (stamp)"},{"id":"20402138","text":"John Thompson Whitaker (January 25, 1906 in Chattanooga, Tennessee - September 11, 1946) was an American writer and journalist who served as a correspondent for several prominent newspapers in different parts of the world. ==Training and early life== He was trained as a journalist at the University of the South, in Sewanee, Tennessee, and began his career as a reporter at the Chattanooga News. He joined after the New York Herald Tribune, where he was sent as a correspondent to Geneva (Switzerland) from 1931 to 1935, to report on the League of Nations. He had a brother named Spires Whitaker who worked as a doctor for the army during World War II.Historical Dictionary of War Journalism, Mitchel P. Roth and James Stuart Olson, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997, pp. 341, . ==War correspondent== In early 1936, he covered the Second Italo-Abyssinian War for CBS, accompanying the Italian troops. The government of Benito Mussolini awarded him the Croce di Guerra (\\"War Cross\\") for his reporting on the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Shortly after he was assigned by his newspaper to Spain, which coincided with his colleague and friend Jay Allen, from Chicago Tribune, covered the Spanish Civil War, where he was seen at several atrocities and, after one of the bloodiest events of the entire conflict, the Massacre of Badajoz, he managed to interview the person responsible for the incident, General Yag√ºe. He also interviewed Mohamed Mizzian, a Moorish general of the Nationalists, and reported on Mizzian giving two captured teenage girls, one found with a trade-union card, to some forty of his troops for mass rape. Whitaker described how Mizzian 'smirked when I remonstrated with him. 'Oh, they'll not live more than four hours,' he said'. He moved back to Europe in mid-1939, in connection with World War II, working for the Chicago Daily News and the New York Post. He moved to Rome, from where he reported the war and the activities of the National Fascist Party. As a convinced democrat, his articles criticized the atrocities of the regimes of Mussolini and Hitler. This made the fascist regime uncomfortable, and in 1941 he was ordered to leave Italy. At the time of his expulsion from Mussolini's Italy, Time reported that Whitaker's dispatches were \\"displeasing\\" to the government. The Italian government was reluctant to formally expel the reporter on whom they had bestowed the Italian War Cross five years earlier, and officials told Whitaker they had \\"nothing personal\\" against him and advised him, \\"You are not expelled, but you must leave.\\" Whitaker reportedly insisted on being formally expelled. ==Books== *Fear came on Europe.

The estate was renamed Juellinge when the Barony of Juellinge was restored for Jens Juel-Vind in 1721, but its old name was restored when the barony was dissolved in 1921. Holsted Priory is still owned by the Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs family. The Neo-Gothic main building is from 1847-49. It is flanked by Halsted Church to the north and the old main building from 1591 to the south. The old main building has been renovated with support from Realdania and is now operated as a local cultural centre. The Baroque-style park covers approximately 6.5 hectares of land. The estate is also home to a golf club. == History The Benedictine priory=== Halsted Priory is a crown property dating from the Viking era. A granite parish church was built on the site in the 12th century. A papal recognition of the priory was written in 1177. Halsted is next mentioned by name in Valdemar Sejr's 1231 Danish Census Book. Erik Plovpenny's daughter Jutta came into possession of Halsted in 1284 but unexpectedly died the same year. She willed it to the abbot of the Benedictine priory in Ringsted. The existing church at Halsted was constructed around the earlier church in conjunction with the building of the daughter monastery which was dedicated to St. Samson the Breton. The church became a pilgrimage site for commoners and royals alike for the veneration of St. Samson, because the church had a reliquary with his head in it. The priory was built in a roughly rectangular shape with space for a dormitory, refectory, kitchens, storage, cellars, and space for lay brothers. No contemporary description of Halsted Priory survives. Given the time period in which it was built, it can safely be said that the buildings were built in Gothic style out of brick as evidenced by the church which still stands today. The interior spaces had vaulted roofs. Halsted was a small house, but must have had at least a few income properties; these would normally have been gifted or willed to a monastery in return for prayers for the souls of the recently departed. The only historical event known to involve the priory was when Prince Erik, the son of Christoffer II, lay at Halsted for 14 days before being moved to his final resting place at Sor√∏ Abbey. In 1510, the Hanseatic League sacked nearby Nakskov and then sailed up the fjord to Halsted, where they set fire to the priory and both the east and west ranges. The priory was restored and was made an abbey, but the winds of change were blowing in Denmark and would within a decade empty the priory permanently. The last abbot of Halsted, Jens Fugl, was installed in circa 1520. The priory archives were entirely lost; the only remaining document today is a single letter of indulgence dated 1517. By the 1520s many Danes were extremely unhappy with the financial burdens the Catholic church imposed on them. In addition to forced payment of tithes and fees for every conceivable service, peasant tenants were also required to work fields and farms owned by the many religious institutions that were a part of everyday life in Denmark at the time. Christian II, Denmark's last Catholic king, was exiled, leaving Frederick I on the throne. Frederik attempted to find a middle ground between the newly fervent Lutherans and the fiercely traditional Catholics. Funds used to support small religious houses like Halsted simply evaporated. Being a daughter house made the priory vulnerable to funding cuts, and it was impossible for the small, out-of-the-way priory to continue operating. Denmark became Lutheran in October 1536 under Christian III. Halsted was permitted to keep its monks until 1537, when the priory reverted to the crown. ===Crown property=== Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow for whom the old main building was constructed After it returned to the crown, the abbey became a royal fief. The first lensmand was Otte Rathlou, who had supported Christian III economically during the Count's Feud. Later vassals included Peder Oxe, J√∏rgen Grubbe and Erik Rosenkrantz. From 1588 to 1631, Halsted Kloster served as the life estate for dowager queen Sophie. She resided at nearby Nyk√∏bing Castle, but she expanded the priory complex in 1591 with a new main building, including a grand staircase and prison tower. From 1647 to 1652, Halsted Kloster served as life estate for Princess Magdalene Sybille. From 1670 to 1685, Halsted Kloster and the crown land on Falster served as life estate for dowager queen Sophie Amalie. Part of the land was laid out as a golf course in the 1980s. ===The Juel family=== Jens Juel-Vind In 1719, Frederik IV ceded Halsted Kloster to Jens Juel-Vind in exchange for Juellinge on Zealand. The older buildings were in sad disrepair, as noted in a crown inventory. In 1721, the estate was renamed Juellinge and becamer the administrative centre of the Barony of Juellinge. After Jens Juel-Vind's death in 1726, Juellinge was passed to his son Jens Krag-Juel-Vind. In 1738, he also inherited stamhuset Stensballegaard from his mother Ida Helle Margrethe Krag's side. After Jens Krag-Juel-Vind's death in 1776, Juellinge and Stensballegaard were passed on to his son Frederik Carl Krag-Juel-Vind. He added -Friis to his name when he inherited Frijsenborg following his mother Sophie Magdalene von Grams's death in 1810. After Frederik Carl Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs' death in 1815, Frijsenborg was passed on to his eldest son while the Barony of Juellinge was taken over by his younger son Carl Ludvig Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs. In 1816, he was granted royal permission to use the title of count in spite of the fact that Juellinges was a barony. Gerdinand Richardt: Juellinge /1845( Carl Ludvig Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs died without children in 1838. Juellinge was therefore endowed to his nephew, Frederik Julius Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs. In 1921, the barony was dissolved as a result of the lensafl√∏sningslov of 1919; the name was changed back to Halsted Kloster in 1922. ==Architecture== Building The modern building called Halsted Priory was constructed in 1847‚Äì49 with Gothic elements to recall the original building on the site. Juellinge was sold by the Juel Vind family in 1921 and the name Halsted Priory was restored to the property. Only the church remains of the old monastery complex. It the oldest remaining church on Lolland. ==Today== The estate has a total area of 2,347 hectares; of these, 313 hectares belong to the manor. Of the remainder, 1,105 hectares are farmland, 1170 hectares are woodland and 72 hectares are used for other purposes. The Baroque-style park is open to the public from April through September. ==List of owners== * (1177-1305) The Crown * (1305-1538) Halstedkloster * (1538-1719) The Crown * (1719-1726) Jens Juel-Vind * (1726-1776) Jens Krag-Juel-Vind * (1776-1815) Frederik Carl Krag-Juel- Vind-(Frijs) * (1815-1838) Carl Ludvig Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs * (1838-1885) Frederik Julius Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs * (1885-1907) Jens Christian Krag-Juel- Vind-Frijs * (1907-1926) Frederik Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs * (1926-1959) Niels Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs * (1959-present) Mogens Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs ==References Further reading== * Salmonsens Conversationslexikon 2nd ed.

He played a few Second XI games for Worcestershire in 1972, but his first-class debut came against the touring New Zealanders at Worcester in late April 1973. In a match badly affected by the weather, he took only one wicket, but it was not a bad one to start with: his county team-mate Glenn Turner, whom Inchmore bowled for 143. His next game, in early May, was his List A debut: a John Player League match against Northamptonshire, in which Inchmore took the single wicket of Geoff Cook. By the end of 1973, Inchmore was a regular in the Worcestershire first team, and he also played a good number of matches in Worcestershire's County Championship-winning season of 1974. He ended with 39 first-class wickets at 22, including his first five-wicket bag, 5/50 against Middlesex in July. The year also saw him hit his only first-class century. Having never before made more than 30, he came in as night-watchman with John Parker after Glenn Turner had retired hurt. Parker took his score to 113 before being run out, while Parker was eventually dismissed for 140. Inchmore played a significant part in each Worcestershire season from then on, taking between 30 and 63 first-class wickets every summer from 1975 to 1985. His highest aggregate of 63 came in 1975, although he fell only one short of that mark in 1979. In one-day cricket, his most successful season was 1981, when he had 33 victims. He was capped by his county in 1976, and in 1976‚Äì77 he played twice for Northern Transvaal in South Africa's Castle Currie Cup. Back in England, in 1977 he produced a career-best innings return of 8/58 against Yorkshire, two wickets in the second innings bringing him his only ten-wicket match haul. However, he was also affected by injury during 1977, and so did not play as much as he had in the previous season. \\"Worcestershire in 1977\\". Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1978. London: Sporting Handbooks, 587. Although he never managed another hundred, Inchmore did continue to put in the occasional decisive innings with the bat. In 1980 he smashed 64 against Yorkshire at Bradford, an innings taking just 35 minutes and including seven sixes; his partner Barry Jones' share in their seventh-wicket stand of 70 was a mere 3! In his main role as a bowler, his later career saw some particularly noteworthy performances in one- day cricket. In a Benson & Hedges Cup match against Lancashire in May 1984, he took 6/29 in a losing cause; this was at the time the second-best performance for the county in the competition. And in August of the following year, he claimed 5/25 against Glamorgan in the NatWest Trophy, this time helping Worcestershire to victory. He won the man-of-the-match award on both occasions. A popular player with the Worcestershire supporters, Inchmore was awarded a benefit season in 1985, which raised over ¬£46,000. He was nearing the end of his career, however, and while he remained at the club for 1986 he played less first-class cricket than he had since the beginning of his time at New Road, though he remained a usual member of the one-day team. His last match for Worcestershire was a John Player Special League game against Derbyshire on 7 September 1986, fittingly at New Road. There was to be no fairy-tale farewell: he took 0/35 from his eight overs and Derbyshire snatched victory thanks to a ninth-wicket partnership of 39. After that, Inchmore played a season for Wiltshire, making a single List A appearance in the NatWest Trophy against Yorkshire. The first-class county won easily, and Inchmore himself took two expensive wickets (Richard Blakey and Jim Love) and scored 3. He continued to play cricket for charity, and in one such game bowled a delivery which was hit by the batsman with such force that it broke the hand of the fielder, one Eric Clapton, who was lucky not to miss a tour of Japan as a result. ==NotesReferences== * Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Northerns cricketers Category:Wiltshire cricketers Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Ashington Category:Northumberland cricketers ","title":"John Inchmore"},{"id":"20402253","text":"Alexander Mosely Pennock (November 1, 1813 - September 20, 1876) was an officer of the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

He became a household name in Australia in the 1930s-1970s, taught at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music for 50 years, introduced many Australians to classical music, and contributed hugely to music making in his adopted country. ==Biography== Moses Isidore Goodman was born in Cape Town, South Africa in 1909 to musical parents of Jewish descent, who had immigrated from eastern Europe. He started studying music early, as well as composing. One of his compositions was performed professionally when he was only six. At age seven, Goodman played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor with the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra.Virginia Goodman, Isador Goodman: A Life in Music After his father died when he was 12, his mother took him to London for its musical opportunities. Goodman studied piano at the Royal College of Music with Lloyd Powell, who had been a student of Ferruccio Busoni.\\"Lloyd Powell\\", Encyclopedia of Music in Canada He studied conducting with Constant Lambert. In 1924, at age 15, Goodman played Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat under Malcolm Sargent. This concerto was to become his \\"calling card\\". His mother remarried, choosing an uncle of her first husband. They returned to South Africa and left the young Goodman in London because of its greater musical opportunities. ==Career== In 1929 at age 20, Goodman accepted an offer to teach at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music in Sydney, Australia. Local musicians opposed the decision by the director W. Arundel Orchard to bring in a man from abroad for a coveted position. \\"William Arundel Orchard\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography Goodman was to teach at \\"the Con\\", on and off, for 50 years. While Professor of Piano by day, he often played all night at jazz clubs in the company of 'hardened drinkers and SP bookies'.Joanna Besley, \\"Review\\" of Diane Collins: Sounds from the Stables: A History of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, The Australian Public Intellectual Network, June 2002 In 1931, the English critic Neville Cardus, who knew nothing of the 22-year-old Goodman, attended two of his recitals. His review described him as > \\"the best pianist in Australia. I would cheerfully stake my reputation on Mr > Goodman's playing in any capital city of Europe in pieces definitely > pianistic or romantic in style. ... he is a natural pianist, he plays the > piano as most of the rest of us breathe ... I did not believe it possible > that I could ever again listen to the D flat Waltz of Chopin with virgin and > delighted ears. But Mr Goodman rippled the hackneyed piece as though for the > first time - Horowitz himself could not have recreated it anew with more > enchanting touch and tone and rhythm\\". Goodman became well known in society circles; the Governor of New South Wales Sir Philip Game and Lady Game became his patrons and personal friends. One night in May 1932, Goodman was at Government House for dinner with the Games. After the governor was repeatedly interrupted for consultation, Goodman asked if he ought to leave. Game said, \\"No, that's not necessary, you see, I am about to dismiss the Premier\\". Later in 1932 Goodman toured Australia and New Zealand for the Tait organisation as associate artist for the visiting Scottish tenor Joseph Hislop. They did not get on, as Hislop felt Goodman was upstaging him. They even came to blows on one occasion. On 1 July 1932 Goodman was soloist in a concert by the National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra. A predecessor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the group broadcast live from the Conservatorium to mark the official start of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In 1935 Goodman wrote the musical score for Harry Southwell's film, The Burgomeister. The score included a drinking song, a lullaby, a peasant song, and a waltz. Becoming the musical director of cinemas in Sydney and Melbourne, Goodman played classical pieces between films. In 1940 he accompanied the English actor No√´l Coward when he appeared in Melbourne. During World War II, in 1942 Goodman joined the Australian Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant. He gave 200 performances to over 150,000 servicemen. In September 1944 he was discharged as medically unfit. He dedicated his New Guinea Fantasy for piano and orchestra to the Australian servicemen. After the war, Goodman returned to Great Britain. His farewell performance at the Sydney Town Hall included the first performance in Australia of Prokofiev's 7th Sonata. Despite playing at a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at St. James's Palace in October 1948, Goodman found it difficult to re-enter British cultural circles and could not find steady work in England in the postwar years. He returned to Australia, this time permanently. In 1955 he wrote a lush, impressionist score for the Australian director Charles Chauvel's landmark 1955 film Jedda, about Aborigines. Elsa Chauvel, the director's wife, scrapped the most innovative passages and replaced them with old-fashioned commercial ‚Äòmood‚Äô music. A late 20th-century review of a video of the film described Goodman's music as being considered now as too European to be appropriate for its topic of Aborigines but noted that the European viewpoint was typical of the time.Andrew Urban, Jedda, Urban Cinefile, 1997-2012 In 1956 Goodman played on the opening night of television station TCN9 in Sydney. He served as the channel‚Äôs musical director for two years. In 1967 he returned to teaching at the NSW Conservatorium. In the early days of Australian television, Goodman starred in two music series of his own. The Isador Goodman Show ran on Melbourne station HSV-7 from 1956 to 1957. His second series was for Sydney station TCN-9 and was called Music for You, running from 1958 to 1960. Seriously injured in a car crash in 1969, Goodman was sidelined from performing for four years. He made a triumphant return to the concert stage with an all-Chopin recital in Sydney in 1973. Later that year he played with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the first series of concerts at the new Sydney Opera House. In February 1974 he appeared in concerts conducted by the American Arthur Fiedler. In 1975, he played Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 at the Concert for Darwin, staged to raise funds for the city devastated by Cyclone Tracy. On Sunday, 13 July 1980 Isador took on the triple role of conductor-soloist-arranger for the Willoughby Symphony Orchestra's concert at the Sydney Opera House which was a spectacular success. Goodman performed in a recital at the new Melbourne Concert Hall (now Hamer Hall) on 31 July 1982. His last recital was at the Sydney Town Hall on 26 September 1982. Goodman died of cancer on 2 December 1982. Later the same day, his lifelong friend and co-teacher at the Sydney Conservatorium, Lindley Evans, also died.\\"Lindley Evans\\", Australian Music Centre ==Marriage and family== Goodman was married four times.

Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes, and relations. == Overview == Common components of ontologies include: ;Individuals: instances or objects (the basic or \\"ground level\\" objects) ;Classes: sets, collections, concepts, types of objects, or kinds of things.See Class (set theory), Class (computer science), and Class (philosophy), each of which is relevant but not identical to the notion of a \\"class\\" here. ;Attributes: aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects (and classes) can have ;Relations: ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another ;Function terms: complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement ;Restrictions: formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input ;Rules: statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form ;Axioms: assertions (including rules) in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application. This definition differs from that of \\"axioms\\" in generative grammar and formal logic. In these disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge. As used here, \\"axioms\\" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements. ;Events: the changing of attributes or relations Ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages. ==Individuals== Individuals (instances) are the basic, \\"ground level\\" components of an ontology. The individuals in an ontology may include concrete objects such as people, animals, tables, automobiles, molecules, and planets, as well as abstract individuals such as numbers and words (although there are differences of opinion as to whether numbers and words are classes or individuals). Strictly speaking, an ontology need not include any individuals, but one of the general purposes of an ontology is to provide a means of classifying individuals, even if those individuals are not explicitly part of the ontology. In formal extensional ontologies, only the utterances of words and numbers are considered individuals ‚Äì the numbers and names themselves are classes. In a 4D ontology, an individual is identified by its spatio-temporal extent. Examples of formal extensional ontologies are BORO, ISO 15926 and the model in development by the IDEAS Group. == Classes == Classes - concepts that are also called type, sort, category, and kind - can be defined as an extension or an intension. According to an extensional definition, they are abstract groups, sets, or collections of objects. According to an intensional definition, they are abstract objects that are defined by values of aspects that are constraints for being member of the class. The first definition of class results in ontologies in which a class is a subclass of collection. The second definition of class results in ontologies in which collections and classes are more fundamentally different. Classes may classify individuals, other classes, or a combination of both. Some examples of classes:Note that the names given to the classes mentioned here are entirely a matter of convention. * Person, the class of all people, or the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a person. * Vehicle, the class of all vehicles, or the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a vehicle. * Car, the class of all cars, or the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a car. * Class, representing the class of all classes, or the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a class. * Thing, representing the class of all things, or the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a thing (and not nothing). Ontologies vary on whether classes can contain other classes, whether a class can belong to itself, whether there is a universal class (that is, a class containing everything), etc. Sometimes restrictions along these lines are made in order to avoid certain well-known paradoxes. The classes of an ontology may be extensional or intensional in nature. A class is extensional if and only if it is characterized solely by its membership. More precisely, a class C is extensional if and only if for any class C', if C' has exactly the same members as C, then C and C' are identical. If a class does not satisfy this condition, then it is intensional. While extensional classes are more well- behaved and well understood mathematically, as well as less problematic philosophically, they do not permit the fine grained distinctions that ontologies often need to make. For example, an ontology may want to distinguish between the class of all creatures with a kidney and the class of all creatures with a heart, even if these classes happen to have exactly the same members. In most upper ontologies, the classes are defined intensionally. Intensionally defined classes usually have necessary conditions associated with membership in each class. Some classes may also have sufficient conditions, and in those cases the combination of necessary and sufficient conditions make that class a fully defined class. thumb Importantly, a class can subsume or be subsumed by other classes; a class subsumed by another is called a subclass (or subtype) of the subsuming class (or supertype). For example, Vehicle subsumes Car, since (necessarily) anything that is a member of the latter class is a member of the former. The subsumption relation is used to create a hierarchy of classes, typically with a maximally general class like Anything at the top, and very specific classes like 2002 Ford Explorer at the bottom. The critically important consequence of the subsumption relation is the inheritance of properties from the parent (subsuming) class to the child (subsumed) class. Thus, anything that is necessarily true of a parent class is also necessarily true of all of its subsumed child classes. In some ontologies, a class is only allowed to have one parent (single inheritance), but in most ontologies, classes are allowed to have any number of parents (multiple inheritance), and in the latter case all necessary properties of each parent are inherited by the subsumed child class. Thus a particular class of animal (HouseCat) may be a child of the class Cat and also a child of the class Pet. A partition is a set of related classes and associated rules that allow objects to be classified by the appropriate subclass. The rules correspond with the aspect values that distinguish the subclasses from the superclasses. For example, to the right is the partial diagram of an ontology that has a partition of the Car class into the classes 2-Wheel Drive Car and 4-Wheel Drive Car. The partition rule (or subsumption rule) determines if a particular car is classified by the 2-Wheel Drive Car or the 4-Wheel Drive Car class. If the partition rule(s) guarantee that a single Car cannot be in both classes, then the partition is called a disjoint partition. If the partition rules ensure that every concrete object in the super-class is an instance of at least one of the partition classes, then the partition is called an exhaustive partition. ==Attributes== Objects in an ontology can be described by relating them to other things, typically aspects or parts. These related things are often called attributes, although they may be independent things. Each attribute can be a class or an individual. The kind of object and the kind of attribute determine the kind of relation between them. A relation between an object and an attribute express a fact that is specific to the object to which it is related. For example, the Ford Explorer object has attributes such as: * Ford Explorer * 6-speed transmission * door (with as minimum and maximum cardinality: 4) * {4.0L engine, 4.6L engine} The value of an attribute can be a complex data type; in this example, the related engine can only be one of a list of subtypes of engines, not just a single thing. Ontologies are only true ontologies if concepts are related to other concepts (the concepts do have attributes). If that is not the case, then you would have either a taxonomy (if hyponym relationships exist between concepts) or a controlled vocabulary. These are useful, but are not considered true ontologies. == Relationships == Relationships (also known as relations) between objects in an ontology specify how objects are related to other objects. Typically a relation is of a particular type (or class) that specifies in what sense the object is related to the other object in the ontology. For example, in the ontology that contains the concept Ford Explorer and the concept Ford Bronco might be related by a relation of type . The full expression of that fact then becomes: * Ford Explorer is defined as a successor of : Ford Bronco This tells us that the Explorer is the model that replaced the Bronco. This example also illustrates that the relation has a direction of expression. The inverse expression expresses the same fact, but with a reverse phrase in natural language. Much of the power of ontologies comes from the ability to describe relations. Together, the set of relations describes the semantics of the domain. The set of used relation types (classes of relations) and their subsumption hierarchy describe the expression power of the language in which the ontology is expressed. Ford Explorer is-a-subclass-of 4-Wheel Drive Car, which in turn is-a-subclass-of Car. An important type of relation is the subsumption relation (is-a-superclass-of, the converse of is-a, is-a-subtype- of or is-a-subclass-of). This defines which objects are classified by which class. For example, we have already seen that the class Ford Explorer is-a- subclass-of 4-Wheel Drive Car, which in turn is-a-subclass-of Car. The addition of the is-a-subclass-of relationships creates a taxonomy; a tree-like structure (or, more generally, a partially ordered set) that clearly depicts how objects relate to one another. In such a structure, each object is the 'child' of a 'parent class' (Some languages restrict the is-a-subclass-of relationship to one parent for all nodes, but many do not). Another common type of relations is the mereology relation, written as part-of, that represents how objects combine to form composite objects. For example, if we extended our example ontology to include concepts like Steering Wheel, we would say that a \\"Steering Wheel is-by-definition-a-part-of-a Ford Explorer\\" since a steering wheel is always one of the components of a Ford Explorer. If we introduce meronymy relationships to our ontology, the hierarchy that emerges is no longer able to be held in a simple tree-like structure since now members can appear under more than one parent or branch. Instead this new structure that emerges is known as a directed acyclic graph. As well as the standard is-a-subclass-of and is-by-definition-a-part-of-a relations, ontologies often include additional types of relations that further refine the semantics they model. Ontologies might distinguish between different categories of relation types. For example: * relation types for relations between classes * relation types for relations between individuals * relation types for relations between an individual and a class * relation types for relations between a single object and a collection * relation types for relations between collections Relation types are sometimes domain-specific and are then used to store specific kinds of facts or to answer particular types of questions. If the definitions of the relation types are included in an ontology, then the ontology defines its own ontology definition language. An example of an ontology that defines its own relation types and distinguishes between various categories of relation types is the Gellish ontology. For example, in the domain of automobiles, we might need a made-in type relationship which tells us where each car is built. So the Ford Explorer is made-in Louisville. The ontology may also know that Louisville is-located-in Kentucky and Kentucky is-classified-as-a state and is-a-part-of the U.S.. Software using this ontology could now answer a question like \\"which cars are made in the U.S.?\\" == Notes == Category:Ontology (information science) ","title":"Ontology components"},{"id":"20402406","text":"Season of the Witch is a 2011 American supernatural action-adventure film starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman, and directed by Dominic Sena. Cage and Perlman star as Teutonic Knights who return from the Crusades to find their homeland ruined by the Black Death. Two church elders accuse a girl (Claire Foy) of being a witch responsible for the destruction; they command the two knights to transport the girl to a monastery so the monks can lift her curse from the land. It reunited Sena and Cage, who had previously worked together on Gone in 60 Seconds. Development on the film began in 2000 when the spec script by screenwriter Bragi F. Schut was purchased by MGM. The project moved from MGM to Columbia Pictures to Relativity Media, where the film was finally produced by Charles Roven and Alex Gartner. Filming took place primarily in Austria, Hungary, and Croatia. Season of the Witch was released on January 7, 2011, in the United States, Canada, and several other territories. ==Plot== In Villach in the 13th century, three women are accused of witchcraft by a priest. The first, a young woman, confesses in an attempt to earn mercy. The second claims she made ointments for profit but not potions. The third, a hag with a blind eye, doesn't deny the charge and curses the priest. He orders all three hanged and drowned. That done, he urges the guards to pull them back up for a ritual to make sure the so-called witches never come back to life. The guards refuse, claiming the women are dead enough. The priest returns late at night to retrieve the corpses and perform the ritual from the Book of Solomon. The first corpse, that of the young girl, shows no sign of life upon reading of the rites. The hag's body vomits and twitches violently, but then goes still when the rites are completed. The third corpse, the one of the woman who had claimed to be an ointment maker, takes on a demonic appearance, sets the Book on fire, and kills the priest by hanging. In the 14th century, German Teutonic Knights Sir Behmen von Bleibruck (Cage) and Sir Felson (Perlman) are engaged on a crusade, taking part in battles throughout the 1330s (1332 Gulf of Edremit, 1334 Siege of Tripoli, 1337 Imbros and 1339 Artah) and eventually in the Smyrniote crusades. After witnessing the massacre of civilians during the 1344 capture of Smyrna, the two knights desert the Order and the crusade and return to Austria. While traveling through Styria, Behmen and Felson encounter the grotesque sight of people infected with the Black Death and discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal their identity as deserters but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise (Christopher Lee), who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl is truly a witch and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who wants to become a knight like his deceased father; a knight, Sir Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from Marburg, shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen. Shortly after setting off, the group camp for the night and Johann decides to take first watch. When Debelzaq comes to relieve him of the watch, Johann says how much she reminds him of his dead daughter, then goes on to speak of the politics of her trial and how the Church cannot have her not be guilty. Johann decides to give up the mission and goes to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Johann has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq but the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross a rickety rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon monstrous wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight. At the monastery, the men find that all the monks have been killed by the plague but locate the Key of Solomon, an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna and Debelzaq begins to perform a ritual used on witches. As Anna begins precisely recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, rather she has been possessed by a demon - he begins frantically performing an exorcism. The demon that is possessing Anna reveals himself and melts the metal of the cage. He fights off the knights effortlessly but when Debelzaq throws a vial of holy water on him, the demon flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they realize he is not trying to escape but to destroy the book so that nothing can stop his powers. They find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, where the demon destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons. The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. During the fight, Demon/Anna breaks Debelzaq's neck, then kills Felson. Kay gathers the book and continues the ritual, while Behmen continues fighting Demon/Anna. Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight but Kay is able to finish the ritual and the demon is expelled from Anna's body, freeing her. After the demon‚Äôs defeat, Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe before dying. Their fallen friends have been buried and Anna asks Kay to tell her about the men who saved her, so they depart from the monastery with the book. ==Cast== * Nicolas Cage as Behmen von Bleibruck * Ron Perlman as Felson * Robert Sheehan as Kay von Wollenbarth * Claire Foy as Anna * Stephen Campbell Moore as Debelzaq * Ulrich Thomsen as Johann Eckhardt * Stephen Graham as Hagamar * Christopher Lee as Cardinal D'Ambroise * Simone Kirby as Midwife in Villach * Nick Sidi as Priest in Villach * Rory McCann as Soldier Commander in Villach * Br√≠an F. O'Byrne as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights ==ProductionDevelopment and filming=== Austrian Alps Screenwriter Bragi F. Schut wrote Season of the Witch as a spec script that was placed on the open market in 2000. Numerous studios bid on the script, and producers Charles Roven and Alex Gartner collaborated with the studio MGM to place a winning bid. MGM could not find traction to produce the film, and in 2003‚Äì2004 the studio \\"was essentially obtained by a number of concerns\\". Columbia Pictures earmarked several properties for themselves, including Season of the Witch. The producers worked with director Dominic Sena to perform location shooting throughout Europe. They sought a 14th-century castle to use as a setting for the story; castles visited in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic could not fit the period. With the film yet to be produced, the project eventually moved to Relativity Media, and Sena was officially attached to direct. Business and creative discussions led to avoiding too much violence or gore in the film so a broader audience could see it. Actor Nicolas Cage was considered for the starring role but was unavailable during the time of the location shooting. Cage eventually became available in 2008 and was cast in the role. He explained his interest, \\"I wanted to make movies that celebrated actors like Christopher Lee and Vincent Price, and the great Roger Corman classics that are unafraid to explore the paranormal and the supernatural.\\" The crew began production immediately after Cage finished Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009). The film had a budget of approximately US$40 million, and much of the budget was covered by Relativity with pre-sales to distributors outside the United States. Filming took place in Austria, Hungary and Croatia. Most of the principal photography took place in practical locations, with several days committed to filming on greenscreen. Scenes were filmed at Burg Kreuzenstein and on the Loser mountain. Principal photography was completed by April 2009, but the cast and crew re-gathered a few months later to film additional battle sequences, filming on greenscreen to save on travel. ===Casting=== Cage stars as Behman of Bleibruck, a Teutonic knight who returns from the Crusades to discover the devastation caused by the Black Plague. The actor had worked with director Dominic Sena on Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) and with producer Charles Roven on City of Angels (1998). Cage was interested in the film's fantastical subject matter, also having recently starred in The Sorcerer's Apprentice. He also described Behmen as \\"the first\\" conscientious objector, saying, \\"I admired... the idea of him breaking from whatever religious propaganda was forced upon him, and still finding an even closer connection with his faith and with God. Those iconoclastic elements to the character made him very interesting to me.\\" For the role, Cage learned horseback riding from Camilla Naprous and her team of horse trainers in England. Cage also worked with a fight choreographer to learn swordfighting. Perlman plays Felson, a knight who is Behmen's best friend and fellow combatant during the Crusades. Perlman said of choosing the role, \\"I love the character. I'm actually more comfortable being a sidekick, because I don't get blamed if it is a complete disaster. I really liked ... his mindset, I liked his irreverence. In the world of seriousness, he's a guy who thinks it's all bullshit. He's just in it for the whores and the sword fights.\\" Perlman described Felson's religion, \\"Whereas Behmen has a very well-articulated idea of his relationship to country and church and spirituality and God, Felson has none. He doesn't bother to spend any time thinking about that.\\" Foy appears in her feature-film debut as the girl who is accused of being a witch. Known for her titular role in the British miniseries Little Dorrit, she met Sena and sought the role in Season of the Witch. She explained the choice, \\"It's quite a manipulative role; the character does a lot of manipulating. Pitting other people against each other, being quite mischievous... That was something I thought would obviously be good to do.\\" Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role. She described its appeal, \\"Playing a character that was making things happen, and mainly in control of an entire group of men. And for once, be the character that is completely in the know about everything. There is nothing that she doesn't know. Nothing is a surprise. And she is able to deal with every single situation that arises the way that she sees fit. And I think that was quite refreshing to be able to play a character that wasn't entirely beholden to everyone else.\\" ===Visual effects=== For Season of the Witch, Tippett Studio designed the demon that manifests in the film's denouement. The art directors researched woodcuts and other artwork for classic demonic appearances. The filmmakers requested an entity \\"lithe and feminine\\", and the visual effects crew designed a demon that had \\"cloven feet, a dog ankle and a fawn leg\\". Designing visual effects for the demon's wings was the biggest challenge since wings tend to get in the way or do not move convincingly. The filmmakers also requested holes in the demon's wings. The crew designed holes that appeared worn instead of ripped since ripped holes would require an added billowing effect. The demon was also designed to have dark gray skin, which presented the crew a challenge in the film's dark settings. Tippett's Blair Clark said, \\"We played the skin like a rotten mummy: nothing too moist, with a lot of wear marks on it.\\" The crew's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon, and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons' deaths have been designed. They drew inspiration from Hellboy (2004) where they focused on the buildup to the demon's death. Clark said, \\"We built it over a series of shots so it doesn't just happen in one shot. We had little patches on the demon that start to crack and result in a glow that looks like it's burning from within.\\" ==Release== Lionsgate scheduled Season of the Witch to be released on March 19, 2010, but five weeks before the date, the studio decided to pull the film from release. Lionsgate originally had an output deal with Relativity Media, but since Relativity had formed its own marketing and distribution arm in 2010, Relativity chose to release the film themselves and in October 2010 the film was pushed back a year from its original release date of March 19, 2010 to January 7, 2011. Season of the Witch was Relativity's first inhouse production. Season of the Witch in January 2010 had been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America, citing \\"thematic elements, violence, and disturbing content\\". The studio edited the film and re-submitted it to the MPAA in November 2010 for a new rating. The MPAA gave the film the same rating and reason for it as before. The film had its world premiere in New York City on January 4, 2011. The film was released commercially on January 7, 2011 in several territories. Pre-release polling had indicated young men were the core demographic for the film, though more women than expected expressed interest in the film. Experts anticipated that the film would gross US$10‚Äì12 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. The film was released in 2,816 theaters in the two territories. It grossed , ranking third at the box office after True Grit and Little Fockers, which were both released at the end of 2010. Relativity Media's exit polling showed that the audience was 52% male and that 61% were 25 years old and up. The Los Angeles Times reported that an \\"unusually high\\" 69% of the audience was nonwhite. Entertainment Weekly reported that the racial diversity of Season of the Witchs audiences was common for supernatural thrillers; the breakdown was 36% Hispanic, 31% Caucasian, 14% Asian, 10% African-American, and 9% \\"other\\". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a C+ grade. The film was the second release by Relativity and performed better than its first release, The Warrior's Way (2010). The opening weekend was not the lowest of Nicolas Cage's career; it was better than The Wicker Man (2006), Next (2007) and Bangkok Dangerous (2008). Season of the Witch grossed in the United States and Canada and in other territories for a worldwide total of . ==Home media== 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (under a new output license deal with Relativity) released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on , 2011. 20th Television holds pay-per-view, on-demand, and television rights to this film under Fox's new deal with Relativity/Rogue. ==Critical reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11%, based on 121 reviews with an average score of 3.62/10. It reported the consensus, \\"Slow, cheap-looking, and dull, Season of the Witch fails even as unintentional comedy.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 28 based on 27 reviews. The film earned a Razzie Award nomination for Nicolas Cage as Worst Actor, but lost to Adam Sandler for Jack and Jill and Just Go with It. Associated Press movie critic Christy Lemire called Season of the Witch \\"a supernatural action thriller that's never actually thrilling\\". She wrote, \\"The scenery is drab, the battles are interchangeable, and no one seems particularly interested in being here. At the same time, Dominic Sena ... never flat-out goes for it in a schlocky, B-horror kind of way. What we're left with is just bloated, boring and utterly forgettable.\\" The critic found Cage and Perlman to be poorly utilized and said of the film's progression, \\"It's a slog from one challenge to the next, with no real tension building, and all the while the alleged witch plays coy about whether she's actually a witch, pouting beneath her bangs, Kristen Stewart-style.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times, critics said that Cage was the primary reason that \\"this swords-and-sorcery romp is a collosal [sic] waste of time\\". Andrew Barker of Variety said Season of the Witch was \\"both overblown and undercooked\\" and thought the film would have been more fun if it had a sense of humor. He called the film \\"too inert for midnight-movie schadenfreudists, and not nearly competent enough for even the most forgiving of fantasy fans\\". Of the film's production value, he said, \\"Witchs photography, costumes and production design are of good quality; editing, scoring and visual effects are most decidedly not.\\" Tom Huddleston of Time Out London wrote, \\"Despite its admirably straight face, Season of the Witch is a silly romp through Pythonesque medieval clich√© and knockabout Hammer horror with a dash of cut-price Tolkien chucked in to keep things moving.\\" Huddleston criticized Cage's performance but praised Perlman's. The critic concluded, \\"Season of the Witch is not for everyone: it‚Äôs creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic. But for a tipsy Saturday night, this should tick all the right boxes.\\" Writing for The Observer, Mark Kermode described it as \\"like a cross between Michael Reeves's brilliant Witchfinder General and Renny Harlin's abysmal Exorcist: The Beginning, with a fair (if unintentional) sprinkling of Monty Python and the Holy Grail thrown in for good measure... It's all utter balderdash from start to finish, with everyone sporting terrible period haircuts, and characters appearing and disappearing in a manner which suggests that the editors' minds were on other things; namely, the big finale which is, sadly, a bit rubbish.\\" Salons Andrew O'Hehir called the film a \\"Hollywood-by-Hungary\\" remake with the \\"B-movie aesthetic\\" of director Roger Corman. O'Hehir wrote, \\"Season of the Witch is an unremitting schlockfest, full of blood and filth, bloated, purulent corpses, ghastly one-eyed witches and undead monks. If there were more such Corman- esque thrills and chills, and a whole bunch less ponderous Bergman references, we'd all be better off.\\" ==ReferencesSeason of the Witch at Metacritic * * * Category:2010s action adventure films Category:2010s fantasy adventure films Category:American films Category:American action adventure films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:Atlas Entertainment films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Demons in film Category:English-language films Category:Films about curses Category:Films about exorcism Category:Films directed by Dominic Sena Category:Films scored by Atli √ñrvarsson Category:Films set in the 14th century Category:Films set in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Films set in Austria Category:Films set in Slovenia Category:Films set in Turkey Category:Films shot in Austria Category:Films shot in Croatia Category:Films shot in Hungary Category:Relativity Media films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films about spirit possession Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:Films about witchcraft ","title":"Season of the Witch (2011 film)"},{"id":"20402420","text":"Anghel Saligny, known for a short time as Linia de CenturƒÉ (\\"Ring Road\\"), is a metro station in southeastern Bucharest on Line M3.

Physical evidence, including low stone walls and construction debris, suggests that several wood structures were also originally present on the site. Pete Berry established Last Chance Mine on Horseshoe Mesa in 1892. He constructed the four-mile Grandview Trail down to the copper mine, and in 1893 began hauling ore out by mule. Although the ore was over 70% pure copper and won a prize at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the mine did not prove profitable, and in 1901 Berry and his partners sold it to the Canyon Copper Company, who operated it until 1907. The mine was then acquired by William Randolph Hearst, who sold it to the National Park Service in 1940. The mineralization at the mine is secondary copper minerals in a breccia zone along a monocline flexure in Navajo Sandstone. Redwall Limestone is bleached, brecciated and marbleized.

At the time of its first settlement, the town was in the western part of Kansas Territory. The town was formally organized in September 1860 and named Laurette, a contraction of the first names of the only two women in the camp, the sisters Laura and Jeanette Dodge.\\"From the silver mines,\\" Daily Rocky Mountain News, 18 Sept. 1860, p. 2.

Little is known for certain about Higginbottom. Some accounts refer to him as an African-American; some accounts say that he was the one who first discovered gold in the vicinity of the town. Mining shifted to rich hardrock deposits in the Phillips lode and other veins. By 1861, when the Laurette/Buckskin Joe Post Office opened, in the newly formed Colorado Territory, the town boasted two hotels, fourteen stores, and a bank. On January 7, 1862 the county seat of Park County moved to Buckskin Joe from Tarryall, now also a ghost town.Park County Local History Archives: Hiking through history Retrieved November 29, 2008.

Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597 (1966), is a 1966 decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may sue in federal court to obtain a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo against the consummation of a merger that the agency persuasively contends violates the antitrust laws.. More broadly, the Dean Foods case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the \\"All Writs Act,\\" seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action. ==Facts== Dean Foods and Bowman Dairy, two substantial competitors in the sale of milk in the Chicago area, agreed to a merger. Dean was the second largest firm and Bowman the third or fourth, and together they accounted for 23% of milk sales in the area.See 384 U.S. at 602 (\\"[A]t the time of the merger, Dean was the third or fourth largest distributor of packaged milk in the Chicago area; Bowman was at least the second largest in that market, and together they enjoyed approximately 23% of the sales of packaged milk in the same area, while the four largest dairy companies had a 43% share thereof.\\"). The FTC filed an administrative complaint to prevent the merger and sought to maintain the status quo pending completion of administrative hearings by filing a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction under the All Writs Act.. The All Writs Act, part of the first Judiciary Act of 1789 and essentially unchanged since then, empowers the federal courts to \\"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\\" ==Ruling of Seventh Circuit== The FTC argued that preliminary injunctive relief was needed pending completion of the administrative process in the FTC. According to the agency, otherwise, Dean would eliminate Bowman as a competitive entity by selling off its milk routes, its plants, and its equipment. This would prevent restoration of Dean as an effective competitor if the agency later found the merger unlawful. The FTC maintained that such preemptive action by Dean would effectively deprive the court of appeals of its appellate jurisdiction to review the FTC's final order, because any order would be meaningless as a practical matter. On that basis, the FTC maintained, the All Writs Act supplied the court of appeals for the area in which the companies operated with jurisdiction to issue preliminary injunctive relief so that a meaningful appeal could later occur.See 384 U.S. at 600. The Seventh Circuit dismissed the petition on the ground that the FTC lacked authority to seek such relief (that is, it had no standing to sue), since Congress had not passed any statute giving the FTC specific authority to seek a preliminary injunction. At that point Dean immediately began closing Bowman down and eliminating it as a business.See 384 U.S. at 599 n.1 (\\"Since consummation of the merger, all assets of Bowman, with the exception of cash and marketable securities which were exempted from the purchase agreement, have been transferred to Dean. Bowman has ceased dairy operations, and now acts as an investment fund, having received and invested the proceeds of the sale.\\"). ==Ruling of Supreme Court== Justice Clark The Supreme Court (5-4), in an opinion by Justice Tom C. Clark. recognized that the FTC had several times, without success, asked Congress to pass a law authorizing it to obtain preliminary injunctions in merger cases. The Court said that this did not matter: \\"Congress neither enacted nor rejected these proposals; it simply did not act on them.\\" In any case, the Court added, nothing has limited the courts' historic powers under the All Writs Act. \\"We thus hold that the Commission has standing to seek preliminary relief from the Court of Appeals under the circumstances alleged.\\" Justice Fortas Justice Abe Fortas wrote a strong dissent, saying that such awesome power to interfere with mergers should not be entrusted to the FTC without a specific authorization from Congress. Fortas had been legal advisor to Federated Department Stores, Inc, at the time of its four-month fight with the chairman and co-founder of Bullock's, Inc., which had involved an intra-family proxy fight in which such an injunction had been threatened. Federated eventually acquired Bullock's, but it was forced to compromise with the FTC in a consent decree in which Federated agreed to make no more acquisitions until 1970.Laura Kalman, 157-58, 163-64 (1990).Bullock's Merger Into Federated Is Taking Shape, N.Y. (Aug. 21, 1964); , 103 (2015).Company-Histories.com, Federated Department Stores, Inc.. ==Significance and aftermath== The reasoning of the Court is not limited to the FTC and by its terms would apply with equal force to any other federal agency in similar circumstances. However, the principle may be limited to situations of great urgency. In FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc., the FTC sought a preliminary injunction against a merger and the Second Circuit denied it. The court said that, under Dean Foods, an injunction can issue only if the Commission can show that \\"an effective remedial order, once the merger was implemented, would otherwise be virtually impossible, thus rendering the enforcement of any final decree of divestiture futile.\\" The Second Circuit thought that the merger probably violated the antitrust laws but did not believe that effective relief would be ‚Äúvirtually impossible.‚Äù In Sampson v. Murray,. the Supreme Court held Dean Foods inapplicable to a stay of a GSA dismissal, stating: \\"In direct contrast to the claim of the FTC in Dean Foods that its jurisdiction would be effectively defeated by denial of relief, the Commission here has argued that judicial action interferes with the normal agency processes. And we see nothing in the record to suggest that any judicial review available under the doctrine of Service v. Dulles would be defeated in the same manner as review in Dean Foods.\\" In the wake of similar decisions, in 1973 Congress passed specific legislation granting the FTC authority to bring suits in district courts to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent consummation of mergers pending action before the FTC, under a legal standard requiring likelihoods of success on the merits rather than a defeat of the agency proceeding.. In addition, Congress passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which also created administrative clearance procedures having the effect of delaying consummation of mergers while agency evaluation of the competitive impact took place. In 1984, the D.C. Circuit relied on Dean Foods as authority for issuance of an order to compel the FCC to act on a petition that it had allegedly delayed unreasonably in acting upon. The delay was almost 5 years.

At 25th Street, a viaduct above the street and the line is for a former Pennsylvania Railroad rail spur designed to serve neighborhood industries. Major intersections along this line include 22nd Street, Passyunk Avenue, and Broad Street, where commuters can connect to Snyder station on the Broad Street Line, along with a RiteChoice Pharmacy, which serves as an auxiliary bus stop for Greyhound and other intercity buses. The next major crossings are at 12th and 11th Streets which carry the southbound and northbound segments of Route 23, also a former trolley line. Just east of Front Street and under I-95, Route 79 runs through Snyder Plaza. Besides the former Route 29 trolley bus, other connections to Route 79 in this area include SEPTA bus routes . Eastbound buses turn north on Dilworth Street until they reach Columbus Boulevard, near Pier 70. The route then turns down Columbus Boulevard until it reaches Snyder Street and head west again before passing by another shopping center known as Columbus Commons.

Tipografia del Libro. == Environment == Since the beginning of the jurassic, from Hettangian to earliest Sinemurian on the western Lombardy Basin there was a notorious continental area, that was found yo be wider than previously thought, where it was developed a warm humid paleoclimate.Jadoul, Flavio, Galli, M. T., Calabrese, Lorenzo, & Gnaccolini, Mario (2005). Stratigraphy of Rhaetian to Lower Sinemurian carbonate platforms in western Lombardy (Southern Alps, Italy): paleogeographic implications. Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 111(2), 285-303. The Dinosaur Fossils foun on the Saltrio formation can have been translated from this area, or alternatively, the Arbostora swell (that was located ant the north of the Saltrio formation, on Switzerland).Kalin, O., & DM, T. (1977).(1977): Sedimentation und Pal√§otektonik in den westlichen S√ºdalpen: Zur triasisch- jurassischen Geschichte des Monte Nudo-Beckens. ‚Äì Eclogae geol This was an emerged structural high close to the Saltrio Formation, that caused a division between two near subsiding basins located at Mt. Nudo (East) and Mt. Generoso (West). It was settled over a carbonate Platform linked with other wider areas that appear along the west to the southeast, developing a large shallow water gulf to the north, where the strata deposited was controlled by a horst and tectonic gaben. There are also found several outcrops of the so-called ‚Äúterra rossa‚Äù paleosoils, including at Castello Cabiaglio-Orino, a dozen of kilometers West of Saltrio.Leuzinger, P. (1925).

This outcrops show that the emerged areas that on the Hettangian-Sinemurian where present where is located the modern Maggiore Lake were covered with forests, what was proven by the presence of large plant fragments on the Moltrasio Formation. The plants have been recovered between the locations of Cellina and Arolo (eastern side of Lake Maggiore), from rocks that have been found to be coeval in age to the Saltrio Formation.Lualdi, A. (1999). New data on the Western part of the M. Nudo Basin (Lower Jurassic, West Lombardy) Tubingen Geowissenschaftliche Arbeiten, Series A, 52, 173-176. The Flora includes genera such as Bennettitales (Ptilophyllum), terrestrial Araucariaceae (Pagiophyllum), and Cheirolepidiaceae (Brachyphyllum), that developed on inland areas with dry- warm conditions. The ammonites from the Saltrio Formation allow the formation to be dated to the Early Sinemurian. Animals probably lived in emerged parts of carbonated platform or an area to the northwest, whose presence had never been established. In the early Sinemurian, the Arbostora swell became again a shallow open sea (ramp-slope), still surrounded South and South-West by emerged land. The dinosaur bones where washed on this period, flowed into a gulf of the Mt. Nudo basin, where they became fossilized. The latter possibility was suggested by Lualdi (1999), in which he analyzed the local geology based on the presence of terrestrial plants and terrigenous content (sands from igneous or metamorphic rocks exposed to sub-aerial erosion) in the limestones. Terrestrial plants are essentially represented by leaves and small branches of Araucariaceans and Bennettitales, the typical flora of the early Mesozoic. However, plants and sand (which are not abundantly referred) can be carried by wind and ocean currents. Also, according to the most current paleogeographic maps, truly continental land located closer these Jurassic times lower were the Mountains of Sardinia, Corsica, distanced many tens of kilometers WNW.Dalla Vecchia, F.M. 2001.

Fossil footprints and tracks are preserved in tidal carbonates deposited in a relatively narrow carbonated platform in Trento, flanked to the east and west by relatively deep marine basins. Large theropods could not live in an atoll, since large areas had to be emersed to provide food and fresh water, and their herbivorous prey needed land with vegetation. The presence of vulcanodontids, cetiosaurs, primitive sauropods, heterodontosaurids, and scelidosaurs have been reported from the Calcari Grigi Group.Masetti, D., Claps, M., Giacometti, A., Lodi, P., & Pignatti, P.

The camp hosts children aged 10-13 from the United States and abroad, who participate in a program built around cultural sharing. The country delegations are partly subsidized by corporate and foundation donors. The project also has a focus on performance, and the children go on a three- week concert tour at the end of the six-week program each summer. ==History== The first Songs of Hope project took place in 1991, and was the idea of Jeanne Junge, a performing arts educator, and Tom Surprenant, a staff member at Dartmouth College Outward Bound School, both residents of Saint Paul, Minnesota. They began designing a program for young people focused on travel, cultural experiences, music, and experiential education, which became the Songs of Hope project. Their idea was to bring delegations of one boy and girl aged 10‚Äì13 from different countries to perform an international concert for local audiences. With help from Saint Paul Mayor James Scheibel, they asked friends and community leaders, including Dick Cohen and Mark Dayton, to join their first board of advisors or to make donations, and then asked community philanthropists to provide funding. They also approached the committees of Saint Paul's six international sister cities in Japan, Italy, China, Mexico, the Soviet Union, and South Africa, asking them to organize delegations of young performers, which all of them did apart from Lawaaikamp, South Africa, which was unable to participate for financial reasons. The delegations from the five sister cities each also included one adult chaperone.The Highland Villager, Songs of Hope, August 7, 1991 Most of the young people lived in shared rooms in a dormitory at St. Catherine University in St. Paul. Rehearsals were held on the college campus.St. Paul Pioneer Press, With Songs of Hope, they learn harmony, August 14, 1991 For financial reasons, only ten of the US participants lived on site; the other eleven performed in the concert, but commuted to and from rehearsals daily.St. Paul Pioneer Press, Songs of Hope in St. Paul. August 10, 1991 The first program was three weeks long, culminating with a single concert on the stage of St. Catherine's O'Shaughnessy Auditorium. The second took place in 1994, and then every year after that. ==Charity outreach== The project is non-profit, with a twin goal of preparing its youth participants to be global citizens with a respect for world cultures, and providing concerts to under-served audiences. The project subsidizes the participation of children from low-income families in the US and abroad thanks to donations from state and federal funding agencies such as the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and private funders such as the Travelers Foundation and General Mills Foundation.St. Paul Pioneer Press, Boot Camp of Hope, July 22, 2002 This funding also enables the organizers to stage low-cost outreach concerts to audiences who have less access to global music or who are unable to attend many live art events due to disabilities. ==Awards and Accomplishments== Since 1991, the program has performed more than 400 concerts to over 90,000 people, ranging from full 90-minute shows to 20-minute arts-in-service concerts. The first project in 1991 received an Award of Excellence from Sister Cities International and Reader's Digest. It later also received a Peacemaker Award for its service to local youth from the Office of the Minnesota Lieutenant Governor. In 2004, 2005, and 2008 the program was one of 50 semifinalists in the Presidential Coming Up Taller Awards, which are sponsored by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, the NEA, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The project has twice received an Access to Artistic Excellence grant from the NEA for a long-term project to tour gradually down the Mississippi River. ==References *Sounds of Hope Category:Summer camps in Minnesota ","title":"Songs of Hope Summer Camp"},{"id":"20402823","text":"Jos√© Gomes Pinheiro Machado (May 8, 1851 ‚Äì September 8, 1915) was a Brazilian republican politician.

The story was first published in August 1851 under the title \\"Science for families. A Voyage in a Balloon\\" (\\"La science en famille. Un voyage en ballon\\") in Mus√©e des familles with five illustrations by Alexandre de Bar. In 1874, with six illustrations by √âmile-Antoine Bayard, it was included in Doctor Ox, the only collection of Jules Verne's short stories published during Verne's lifetime. An English translation by Anne T. Wilbur, published in May 1852 in Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature, marked the first time a work by Jules Verne was translated into the English language. ==Plot outline== Just as the narrator starts the ascent of his balloon, a stranger jumps into its car. The unexpected passenger's only intent is to take the balloon as high as it will go, even at the cost of his and pilot's life. The intruder takes advantage of the long journey to recount the history of incidents related to the epic of lighter-than-air travel. This short story foreshadows Verne's first novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon. ==English publication== The story has appeared in English translation in the following forms.

O'Neill was, among many other things, a member of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who had previously been an author, sheriff, and a judge in his native Arizona. He was killed in action in Cuba in 1898, but was instrumental in establishing what would eventually become the Grand Canyon Railroad and Grand Canyon National Park. The cabin is the oldest extant structure on the South Rim. It was used as an office for tourist accommodations in the area during the 1890s, which eventually evolved into the Bright Angel Hotel. After the hotel was sold to the Fred Harvey Company it remained much as it was when built. It was incorporated into the rebuilt Bright Angel Lodge complex by Mary Jane Colter in 1935. The one-story cabin is a wood frame structure on a low stone foundation, right on the edge of the Grand Canyon. The shallow-pitched roof is covered with wood shingles. The cabin is connected to other lodge buildings using compatible, unobtrusive materials, and has been cited as an early example of an adaptive reuse of a historic structure. The cabin is one of the guest accommodations of the Bright Angel lodge. The Buckey O'Neill Cabin was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1975. It is included in the Grand Canyon Village National Historic Landmark District. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Houses in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Grand Canyon Category:1890s architecture in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Canyon National Park Category:Fred Harvey Company Category:1890 establishments in Arizona Territory Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coconino County, Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Canyon National Park ","title":"Buckey O'Neill Cabin"},{"id":"20402917","text":"Maire Aunaste Maire Aunaste (n√©e √útt, born November 7, 1953) is an Estonian journalist.

The line runs between the Gray's Ferry neighborhood and the vicinity of Pier 70 along the Delaware River. Route 29 was a streetcar line from its inception in 1913 until 1947, and a trolley bus line until 2003. ==Route description== Unlike the nearby SEPTA Route 79, Route 29 runs primarily along one-way streets. Eastbound buses run primarily along Morris Street, while westbound buses run primarily along Tasker Street. The west end of the Tasker Street segment turns north at 33rd Street, then east at Dickinson Street, then south at 32nd Street before heading east to Morris Street. Recent redevelopment of the Gray's Ferry area has disrupted this pattern. At 25th Street, a viaduct above the two streets is for a former Pennsylvania Railroad rail spur designed to serve neighborhood industries. Major intersections along this line include 22nd Street, and Broad Street and connect to Tasker-Morris Station on the Broad Street Line. The next major crossings are at 12th and 11th Streets which carry the southbound and northbound segments of SEPTA Route 23. Route 23 was also a former streetcar line that was replaced with a bus route in 1992. Passyunk Avenue runs southwest to northeast in between these two intersections. Connections at Pier 70 include 7, 25, 64, and 79. All buses are ADA-compliant, and contain bicycle racks. ==History== Route 29 streetcar service started November 16, 1913, replacing Route 7 crosstown streetcar service on Tasker and Morris Streets. Trackless trolleys replaced streetcars on August 9, 1947. ===Bus service=== Along with SEPTA Routes 59, 66, 75, and 79, the Route 29 trolley bus was replaced with a diesel bus service in on February 23, 2003.Trolleybus Magazine No. 249 (May‚ÄìJune 2003), p. 70. National Trolleybus Association (UK). ISSN 0266-7452. This coincided with an extension of service east from Front Street to the Pier 70 Shopping Center. A proposal to restore trolleybus service along Route 29 (along with Route 79) was considered by SEPTA in 2006, after the authority had placed an order for 38 new trolley buses for Routes 59, 66 and 75, all of which returned to trolleybus service in 2008. However, in October 2006 the authority's board voted against any further consideration of purchasing new trolley buses to allow Routes 29 or 79 to be restored, a decision that effectively eliminated the possibility that trolley bus service might return to Routes 29 and 79.Trolleybus Magazine No. 271 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2007), p. 23. National Trolleybus Association (UK). ISSN 0266-7452. As part of a pilot program, in 2016 SEPTA placed an order for 25 new battery electric buses from Proterra, Inc. They, along with two overhead charging stations, are being purchased using a $2.6-million Federal Transit Administration grant and are expected to enter service on Routes 29 and 79 in 2017, returning electric propulsion to these routes after nearly 15 years of diesel operation. ==See also== *Trolleybuses in Philadelphia ==References * SEPTA Route 29 (Official Map and Schedule) * Photos of SEPTA Route 29 Trackless Trolleys 29 29 29 ","title":"SEPTA Route 29"},{"id":"20402933","text":"Colin Frizzell (born 1971) is Canadian author of young adult novels from Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada.

Established from 1926 through the 1930s, the district includes examples of rustic architecture as applied to employee residences, administrative facilities and service structures. ==History== The North Rim experienced very little development until 1926, in part due to the intervention of Senator Ralph Cameron, who held commercial interests in the park area prior to its establishment, and who prevented funding of North Rim improvements. Starting in 1926, the first structures included the Ranger Residence and the accompanying wood shed and horse barn. Additional structures were added during the late 1920s and 1930s, including various equipment storage areas, warehouses, and residences. The last structure to be constructed as part of the North Rim Headquarters was an equipment shed in 1936. Over the years, the use of these buildings has changed considerably, however, in most instances, these changes do not affect the exterior of the structure. The most significant architectural qualities are limited to the exterior facades, the fireplace in Residence No. 102, and to the wrought iron door hinges on several of the maintenance buildings. ==Description== The district comprises two sections, each with residences. The eastern portion includes a garage and a ranger station, while the western group includes an office, a barn and maintenance buildings. The oldest structure, a residence, is a one-story gable-roofed structure, built in frame on a stone foundation with lap siding in 1926. Other houses, sheds and a dormitory were built in 1931. The dormitory is particularly notable for its expression of the rustic style. A ranger station, also known as the old administration building, was built in 1931 and moved in the mid-1930s, but was destroyed by fire on March 5, 1982. Other buildings include a machine shop (1932), gas and oil station (1933) and a variety of residences. ==Historic designation== The Grand Canyon North Rim Headquarters District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1982. ==See also== *North Rim of the Grand Canyon *Architects of the National Park Service *Buildings and structures in Grand Canyon National Park *National Register of Historic Places listings in Grand Canyon National Park ==References * , also , , , , , , , , , and * North Rim Headquarters Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Government buildings completed in 1926 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:1926 establishments in Arizona Category:Buildings and structures in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Arizona Category:Rustic architecture in Arizona Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Canyon National Park ","title":"Grand Canyon North Rim Headquarters"},{"id":"20403138","text":"A Barangay captain (Filipino: punong barangay), also known as a barangay chairman, is the highest elected official in a barangay, the smallest level of administrative divisions of the Philippines. Sitios and puroks are sub- divisions of barangays, but their leadership is not elected. As of September 2012, there are 42,028 barangays and therefore 42,028 barangay captains. The current position was created by the 1991 Local Government Code, and is a successor to historical positions known variously as Cabeza de Barangay, barrio lieutenant, and barrio captain. Along with the college of barangay kagawad (English: barangay councilors), captains comprise the Sangguniang Barangay or Barangay Council. They perform many official government duties, and execute minor judicial powers as part of Barangay Justice System, such as settling disputes between neighbours. Viewed as village elders, they also work informally with a number of organizations. Barangay officials receive a salary of between ‚Ç±600 and ‚Ç±1,000 a month as per the Local Government Code. They receive other forms of compensation as well. Captains are elected for three- year terms. The most recent 2018 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections were held on May 14, 2018. ==History== While the current structure dates only to the 1970s, the concept of a village leader has a long history, as it was already evident amongst pre-colonial barangays. During the Spanish era, the office was known by the title Cabeza de Barangay (literally, \\"head of the barangay\\"), and was an unelected post. At the beginning of the American colonial period, the office was renamed barrio lieutenant. Under the Administrative Code of 1917, passed by the Philippine Assembly, these too were not elected but rather appointed by and under the supervision of the city councillor for the barrio. Councillors were elected at that time by electoral districts. Barrio lieutenants received no pay or other compensation. The lieutenant was to assist the city councillor and his term ended when the councillor's term ended. During the American colonial period and after independence in 1946, barangays were known as barrios and barangay leaders were known as barrio lieutenants. In 1991, the position took its present name and form with amendments to the Local Government Code. ==Relation to other governments== President means that the President only exercises general supervision over local government.

Mail with the Vineta provisional stamp was sent from Pernambuco to Germany on 17 April 1901. Only 600 stamps were issued making this provisional stamp one of the rarer stamps in German philately. ==Catalogue status== The stamp gained notoriety after it was included in the Michel catalogue as a regular stamp and given the number 67. Collectors who aspired to put together a complete collection of issues of the Reichspost had an interest in acquiring this stamp. However, because philatelists generally considered the stamp a self-made variety, not an official issue by the Reichspost, the #67 assignment was heavily criticised and eventually withdrawn. As a result, prices for the stamp have declined. The stamp has been forged.

He was born in Milan in 1957.Helen Greenwood for Domain. 9 September 2004 Luigi's list Coming from a long line of engineers, he studied architecture at the Ecole Politechnique Federale in Lausanne, where he met Alvaro Siza and Mario Botta, who offered Rosselli a job in 1979. He left the next year to work for Mitchell/Giurgola in their New York office at the age of 23. That firm won a commission to design the Australian Parliament House, and Rosselli moved to Canberra in 1981 to work on that project. He met his wife there, and the two of them moved to Sydney in 1984. A year later he joined Furio Valich's firm, then opened his practice a year later. When he founded his Sydney practice in 1985, he developed a ritual of showing his freehand design concept sketches using black felt pens and white Tipp Ex (correcting fluid) on translucent yellow tracing paper, torn from small rolls. In 1989, two musicians from INXS contacted him to design their houses. One was a bush house on the Hawkesbury River, the other was an addition to a 1930s brick duplex. They were published in 1191 in Vogue Living and Architect Australia. His work has primarily been residential, but in the 1990s he worked on a series of restaurants. His approach to architecture is \\"humanist, where people and environment take precedence over preconceived design dogmas\\" and his main concern is designing for the humans: for their daily lives, for the human senses, for the psychology of the users, to create a sense of comfort and satisfaction and aiming for the \\"Architecture of Happiness\\"Timeline of Luigi Rosselli's designs from 1990-2012 Family homes like The Books House, which is a series of stacked terrace platforms following the steep sandstone topography of Sydney's northern shore.

In 1667, he gave the first official Ball to be held in Canada, and he was the great-grandfather of the last Governor General of New France, Pierre Fran√ßois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal. ==Early life in France== Born at Paris c.1612, he was the son of Ren√©-Pierre Chartier de Lotbiniere (1572‚Äì1654), Counsellor in the French Parliament, Royal Professor of Medicine and Premier Medicin du Roi to Louis XIII of France. His mother, Fran√ßoise Bourcier (d.1631), was Lady-in-waiting to Henrietta Maria of France and the daughter of Louise Bourgeois Boursier. His family originated from Dijon in the fourteenth century, and he included amongst his ancestors Alain Chartier. The family were ennobled at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and his forebears married into such families as the Chateaubriands, Rochefoucaulds and Polignacs. According to tradition, one of the early Chartiers owned two estates near Dijon: Bini√®re and Bigni√®re. The manor at Bini√®re was surrounded by a moat in which many lot fish swam, and so to differentiate between the two he called that one Lotbini√®re. As a young man, Louis-Th√©andre Chartier de Lotbini√®re lived as the seigneur of Saint-√âtienne de Monays, but soon made over this living to his brother, Ren√© (d.1655), who had lived in Canada between 1643 and 1647 as chaplain to the Ursulines of Quebec. At Paris, 1641, Louis-Th√©andre married √âlisabeth d'Amours de Clignancourt (1613‚Äì1690), the daughter of Louis d'Amours de Louvieres (d.1640), Sieur de Serain, First Councillor to King Henry IV of France at the Grand Ch√¢telet. Her brother, Mathieu d'Amours de Chauffours was a relative of Jean de Lauzon, the future governor of New France. Likely at the request of de Lauzon, with whom they made the journey (together with Mathieu d'Amours) Chartier and his family came to New France, arriving in Quebec, October 13, 1651. ==Official positions in New France== On his arrival in Quebec Lotbiniere was appointed Seigneurial Attorney to the Seneschal‚Äôs Court at Quebec, and five years later was promoted to Lieutenant-General for Civil and Criminal Affairs. He kept this office until the autumn of 1663, when the Seneschal‚Äôs Court was replaced by the Sovereign Council of New France. After the removal of Attorney-General Jean Bourdon and his allies in early 1664, despite the opposition of Bishop Fran√ßois de Laval, Lotbiniere was appointed Deputy Attorney General of the Sovereign Council of New France. When Bourdon was re-instated a few months later, Lotbiniere in turn resigned. Furious that Bourdon had been brought back, in the absence of Laval, Lauzon again dismissed Bourdon etc. and made Lotbiniere Attorney-General. Due to a more favourable position Lotbiniere resigned in 1666, and Bourdon was again re-instated. The French West India Company, set up in 1664, had been authorized to ‚Äúestablish judges and officers wherever there will be need and wherever it will find it appropriate.‚Äù The company made use of this privilege to create a Provost‚Äôs Court at Quebec (the Sovereign Council of New France was only called on in the case of an appeal), and in the spring of 1666 named Lotbiniere Lieutenant General for Civil and Criminal Affairs of the court. He remained in this position until 1677 when he resigned in his son‚Äôs favour. On May 27, 1671, the Ladies of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec sold the former residence of Governor Louis d'Ailleboust de Coulonge to de Lotbiniere, which he immediately made his home. The residence, though much altered, is today the French Consulate in Quebec, and locally known as Duke of Kent House, Quebec. His son, Ren√©-Louis Chartier de Lotbini√®re, continued to live there with his family until his death in 1709. It was sold to the Maillou family, who leased it from 1743 to Louis-Theandre's great grandson, Michel Chartier de Lotbini√®re, Marquis de Lotbini√®re. ==Return to France and reputation== He had taken his stepmother to court over his inheritance which necessitated him to be in France in 1659 and 1677. In the autumn of 1679, he returned to France, never to return to the colony again. In 1680, Intendant Jacques Duchesneau de la Doussini√®re et d'Ambault wrote to the minister that Lotbiniere's daughter, Marie-Francoise, the widow of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson and the future mother-in-law of Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, ‚Äúhas lost 1,000 livres which were granted to her last year, and a part of the 600 livres for the present year that her father the Sieur Chartier, to whom she had given powers of attorney, has consumed by his excesses, having continued to live in Paris.‚Äù This revelation reflects the character of the ‚Äúerstwhile‚Äù Lieutenant-General of the Provost‚Äôs Court. As a relative of Lauzon he had occupied important offices from the time he arrived in New France, but he never enjoyed the Jesuits‚Äô esteem as much as the other settlers of his social standing. Neither did the clergy appear to have looked favourably upon the ball given by him on 4 February 1667, the ‚Äúfirst ball in Canada,‚Äù (according to the Journal des J√©suites). In 1676, Ange de Bouges, known as 'la Corruble', was arrested by order of the council, and imprisoned because of his scandalous conduct in the company of some young men. Lotbiniere had him released the following day, and when asked to give an explanation before the council, 'the Lieutenant-General refused to give his reasons, and furthermore his manner was peremptory and lacking in respect. Summoned to appear again, he maintained that he alone had the right to decide upon imprisonments. He resorted to an attitude of arrogance, and refused to justify his action any further. On 3 August the council relieved him of his office, which he resumed however before the end of the month.' (Dictionary of Canadian Biography). An officer of justice for over thirty years, Jean Talon deemed Chartier de Lotbiniere as ‚Äúill suited to this profession‚Äù. He died in France in 1688, and was the father of two children, Ren√©-Louis Chartier de Lotbini√®re, and Louise-Elizabeth, who married Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson. == References == Category:Canadian nobility (French) Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death uncertain Category:People from Paris ","title":"Louis-Th√©andre Chartier de Lotbini√®re"},{"id":"20403389","text":"Papatoetoe electorate boundaries between 1993 and 1996. Papatoetoe is a former New Zealand parliamentary electorate, and is part of greater Auckland. ==Population centres== The 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the Representation Act in 1886, initiated by Muldoon's National Government. As part of the 1976 census, a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred MƒÅori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island. The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Papatoetoe) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the . Papatoetoe was created from parts of the and electorates in the 1977 redistribution. The electorate is urban- suburban, based on the suburb of Papatoetoe, and was in Manukau City, South Auckland. At various times it also included parts of the suburbs of Otara, Wiri and Mangere. To the north it bordered on the Tamaki River, and between and it reached the eastern edge of Manukau Harbour. It also bordered on the electorates of ,, and from 1978 to 1984, and , , Manurewa and Mangere from 1984 to 1996. The Papatoetoe electorate was eventually absorbed into Mangere and the newly created electorates for the 1996 election. ==History== The electorate existed from to the introduction of mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation in and was represented by two Labour MPs. In the 1978 election, the Papatoetoe electorate was won by Eddie Isbey, who had been MP for the electorate since . Isbey retired at the and was succeeded by Ross Robertson.

Caesar's Column was published pseudonymously in 1890.\\"Edmund Boisgilbert, M.D.,\\" Caesar's Column: A Story of the Twentieth Century, Chicago, F. J. Shulte and Co., 1890. The book has been variously categorized as science fiction, speculative fiction, dystopian fiction, and/or apocalyptic fiction;Frederic Cople Jaher, Doubters and Dissenters: Cataclysmic Thought in America, 1885-1918, New York, Free Press of Glencoe, 1964. one critic has termed it an \\"Apocalyptic Utopia.\\"Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984. The book is also a political novel, and a romance. It was a popular success as well, selling 60,000 copies upon its initial publication. Its sales eventually comprised 250,000 copies.Alexander Sexton, \\"Caesar's Column: The Dialogue of Utopia and Catastrophe,\\" American Quarterly, Vol. 19 No. 2 Part 1 (Summer 1967), pp. 224-238; see p. 227. Donnelly's novel was one element of the great wave of utopian and dystopian literature during the later nineteenth century and the early twentieth, exemplified by works like Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and Jack London's The Iron Heel.Allyn B. Forbes, \\"The Literary Quest for Utopia, 1880-1990,\\" Social Forces, Vol. 6 No. 2 (December 1927), pp. 179-89.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976. ==Politics== Caesar's Column is partly based on Donnelly's commitment to agrarian Populism. In 1892, two years after the publication of his novel, Donnelly drafted the platform of the Populist Party, in which he wrote, :\\"A vast conspiracy against mankind has been organized on two continents, and it is rapidly taking possession of the world. If not met and overthrown at once it forebodes terrible social convulsions, the destruction of civilization, or the establishment of an absolute despotism.\\"Quoted in Pfaelzer, p. 121. This is the world view of Caesar's Column: a man comes from his rural environment to the heart of a brutal capitalist oligarchy; he sees its corruptions firsthand, and witnesses its destruction. Donnelly's novel partly concerns the debated question of the alleged anti-Semitism of the Populist movement.Norman Pollack, \\"Handlin on Anti-Semitism: A Critique of American Views of the Jew,\\" Journal of American History, Vol. 51 No. 3 (December 1964), pp. 391-403.Norman Pollack, \\"The Myth of Populist Anti-Semitism,\\" American History Review, Vol. 68 No. 1 (October 1962), pp. 76-80. Donnelly's villain is an Italian Jew -- but his protagonist has a name, Weltstein, that must have suggested a Jewish identity to many readers.Sexton reads the name as \\"Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon\\" rather than Jewish; Sexton, pp. 233-4. ==The plot== As some other speculative writers did (Anna Bowman Dodd's 1887 book The Republic of the Future is a contemporaneous example), Donnelly cast his fiction in the form of an epistolary novel. His first-person narrator Gabriel Weltstein writes a series of letters to his brother, recounting his experiences during a 1988 visit to New York. Weltstein is a wool merchant from Uganda (early Zionist thinkers considered the possibility of founding a Jewish state in Uganda). Weltstein wants to avoid dealing with an international cartel and sell wool directly to American manufacturers. Like many utopian/dystopian writers, Donnelly dwells on the technological changes of the future. Weltstein travels to New York City by airship; he is dazzled by the city's brilliant illumination, powered by tapping into the Aurora Borealis. In the city, subways operate below transparent sidewalks. At the Hotel Darwin, Weltstein finds a televised menu to guide him among exotic choices, from edible spiders to bird's nests from China. Televised newspapers are readily available. Weltstein soon gets into trouble, when he stops a coachman from beating a beggar. The coach belongs to Prince Cabano, formerly Jacob Isaacs, a prime figure of the ruling oligarchy; the beggar is Max Petion, actually a leader of a secret resistance organization called the Brotherhood of Destruction. Weltstein has to accept Petion's guidance into proletarian society in New York City, where he learns the truth of the rapacious and oppressive social and economic order. Gabriel meets the president of the brotherhood, Caesar Lomellini, a dangerous and ruthless fanatic and an imposing physical presence, half Italian and half Negro.Pfaelzer, pp. 125-6. The middle section of the novel devotes attention to the romantic involvements of Gabriel and Max Petion, who rescue young women from exploitation. The two couples marry in a bucolic episode that counterpoints the scenes of urban oppression and violence that bracket it. (The four characters escape New York for Uganda at the end of the book, providing a sort of happy ending, which likely enhanced the novel's popularity.) The Brotherhood of Destruction finally organizes a rebellion, which succeeds in deposing the oligarchs, though at the cost of massive casualties. (Technology has produced advanced weapons like \\"dynamite bullets\\" that increase the carnage.) Lomellini orders the corpses piled high in Union Square and entombed in layers of concrete‚Äîthough Lomellini himself is murdered as the mass grave is started. Gabriel Weltstein, fleeing New York by airship, looks back to see the vast cityscape in flames, while the mass grave‚ÄîCaesar's column‚Äîrises through the smoke. ==ReferencesSource etext of Caesar's Column at sacred-texts.com * Caesar's Column online * Single-page HTML text at Project Gutenberg Category:1890 science fiction novels Category:1890 American novels Category:Novels set in the 1980s ","title":"Caesar's Column"},{"id":"20403394","text":"The Alpine Mastiff is an extinct Molosser dog breed, Although they have the same origin as Saint Bernard but they are still two totally different breeds. Alpine Mastiff is a major contributor to the modern Mastiff (through such dogs as \\"Couchez\\"), as well as to other breeds that derive from these breeds or are closely related to them. M.B. Wynn wrote, \\"In 1829 a vast light brindle dog of the old Alpine mastiff breed, named L'Ami, was brought from the convent of Great St. Bernard area, and exhibited in London and Liverpool as the largest dog in England.\\" William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, is believed to have bred Alpine Mastiffs at Chatsworth House. The names \\"Alpine Mastiff\\" and \\"Saint Bernard\\" were used interchangeably in the early 19th century, but still they are 2 totally different breeds, though the variety that was kept at the hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass was significantly altered by introducing other breeds, including Newfoundland and Great Dane,The Dog Book, vol2, James Watson, 1906. Doubleday, Page & Co. and it is this composite breed that now carries the name St. Bernard.The American Book of the Dog, G.O.Shields, 1891, Rand McNally. Inevitably these dogs filtered through to the wider population, and the original variety dwindled in its pure form, though a rare breed, the \\"Cane Garouf\\" or \\"Patua\\", found in the part of the Alps formerly inhabited by the Alpine Mastiff, may also descend from the extinct breed. The Alpine Mastiff was, along with the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd Dog, one of the earliest breeds of dog to reach truly gigantic size. It was one of the first true mastiffs, originating in northern Europe before 500 B.C. The largest individuals may have reached more than tall at the shoulder and weighed or more, surpassing the modern Saint Bernard and English Mastiff in size. Beginning in the 1970s, there have been some efforts to breed back the Alpine Mastiff, mainly by using breeds such as the Saint Bernard, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees and Bernese Mountain Dog. ==See also== *Alpine Spaniel (possibly a synonymous name)The Practical Kennel Guide with Plain Instructions on How to Rear and Breed Dogs for Pleasure, Show and Profit, M.

He is known as the \\"Apostle of Mauritius\\" due to his tireless work in aiding the poor and ill. Laval also educated the flock he was assigned to for those people were uneducated and were former slaves for the most part. His skills in medicine made him a distinguished figure in the region since his expertise allowed him to tend to those who suffered illness that manifested more so during times of an epidemic. On 29 April 1979 he became the first beatified member of his religious order. ==Life== Jacques- D√©sir√© Laval was born on 18 September 1803 in Croth, the son of Jacques Laval, successful farmer. His parents had three daughters before him and hoped for a boy. He grew up in a pious household. His mother died when he was seven. His uncle Nicolas was a priest and oversaw his religious instruction. Laval was educated at √âvreux and at the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris where he studied humanities. He was uncertain whether to pursue ecclesial studies for the priesthood or pursue the practice of medicine and he received his medical doctorate on 21 August 1830 before setting up a practice in Saint-Andr√© and Ivry-la-Bataille. His thesis that secured his doctorate was on rheumatoid arthritis. But he became more vain and was ignoring the spiritual things in life as he served in medicine from September 1830 to April 1834. He reexamined his choice after a near-fatal riding accident. Feeling he was called to the priesthood he closed his practice a few months later in 1834 and began his studies for the priesthood in Saint-Sulpice on 15 June 1835; he received his ordination on 22 December 1838 (from the Archbishop of Paris Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len) and worked as a parish priest until 1840. During his ecclesial studies he befriended Fran√ßois Libermann (the two later collaborated in the missions). He desired a more active life as a priest and therefore entered the Spiritans. He was sent to the missions on the island of Mauritius on 14 September 1841. Most of his parishioners were poor and uneducated former slaves. He lived with them and learned their language while also fasting when supplies were short; he slept in a packing crate. His medical training was useful in this regard as he worked to improve conditions in agriculture as well as science and sanitation. His success is said to have been so great that it is believed to have converted 67 000 people in his parish. Laval died in 1864 after a series of apoplectic attacks. The funeral oration commented on the words of Isaiah: Evangelizare pauperibus misit me ‚Äî \\"He sent me to announce the Gospel to the poor\\".; The casket had 30 000 people following it and was buried opposite the church in Sainte Croix. ===Memorials=== There is a building on the campus at the Spiritans' Duquesne college in Pittsburgh - which is named \\"Laval House\\" in honor of the late Father Laval. ==Beatification== Laval's tomb The cause for beatification commenced in both √âvreux and Port Louis on a diocesan level before theologians investigated and approved his spiritual writings on 9 August 1916. The formal introduction to the cause came on 26 June 1918 under Pope Benedict XV and he was titled as a Servant of God. The second diocesan process was later conducted and these two processes received validation in Rome from the Congregation for Rites on 5 June 1936 upon their completion. Officials from the C.O.R. approved the documents related to the cause on 15 October 1957 before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and their consultants approved it later on 17 November 1970. The C.C.S. then granted their approval on 21 December 1971 before having to bring it to the pope for final confirmation. That confirmation from Pope Paul VI on 22 June 1972 allowed for Laval to be titled as Venerable, acknowledging that Laval led a life of heroic virtue. The cognitional process for a miracle opened and closed in Mauritius in 1926 before it received C.C.S. validation in Rome later on 6 December 1973. The miracle that led to his beatification was the 17 July 1923 cure of Joseph Edgradi Beaubois - an Anglican who later converted - from acute eczema on his face and neck. Medical experts approved this healing to be a miracle on 4 December 1975 as did the C.C.S. and their consultants on 18 January 1977; the C.C.S. held another session and approved it on 22 February 1977. Paul VI confirmed this miracle on 7 July 1977 and thus approved Laval's beatification. But the death of Paul VI and the later death of Pope John Paul I prevented the beatification from being celebrated in late 1978 as was intended. The beatification was not celebrated until Pope John Paul II presided over it on 29 April 1979. John Paul II visited Laval's tomb in Mauritius on 14 October 1989. The current postulator for this cause is the Spiritan priest Jean-Jacques Boeglin. The date of Laval's death has become an annual celebration of sorts in which it was marked with a festival and a procession to the site of his tomb. The annual pilgrimage to the parish church of Sainte-Croix originated on the date of his funeral procession in 1864. On an annual level offerings and ex votos are placed at the site of his tomb from the night of 8 September until the end of his feast. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Spiritans * The Black Cordelias Category:1803 births Category:1864 deaths Category:19th-century French people Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris alumni Category:French beatified people Category:French emigrants to Mauritius Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:French Roman Catholic priests Category:Holy Ghost Fathers Category:People from Eure Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Mauritius Category:Venerated Catholics ","title":"Jacques-D√©sir√© Laval"},{"id":"20403448","text":"Jorge Sanguinetti (November 14, 1934 ‚Äì January 5, 2017) was a Uruguayan political figure. ==Background== For many years, he was associated with local political affairs in Colonia Department.

For example, in a unital *-Banach algebra, the closed unit ball is contained in the closed convex hull of the unitary elements. A more precise result is true for the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space: If T is such an operator and T < 1 ‚àí 2/n for some integer n > 2, then T is the mean of n unitary operators. ==Applications== This example is due to Russo & Dye, Corollary 1: If U(A) denotes the unitary elements of a C*-algebra A, then the norm of a linear mapping f from A to a normed linear space B is :\\\\sup_{U \\\\in U(A)} f(U).

The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils, especially ammonites. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geological timescale, thus fully including the Hettangian stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. Stratigraphically it can be subdivided into three members: the Wilmcote Limestone, Saltford Shale and Rugby Limestone.; 2001: The lithostratigraphy of the Blue Lias Formation (Late Rhaetian‚ÄìEarly Sinemurian) in the southern part of the English Midlands , Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 112(2), pp. 97-110. ==Lithology and facies== The Blue Lias comprises decimetre scale alternations of argillaceous limestone and mudstone. These alternations are caused by short-term climatic variations during the Early Jurassic attributed to orbital forcing (Milankovitch cycles). These limestone-mudstone alternations pass up into a clay member formerly known as the Lower Lias Clay now the Charmouth Mudstone. This lithology consists of monotonous mudstones weathering to clay at the surface. Sparse thin limestone and nodule bands are seen where the rocks are exposed. The deposition of a clay-rich mudstone member normally indicates deposition in a deeper marine environment. The lowest beds of the formation are referred to as the \\"Pre-planorbis beds\\" in reference them being deposited before the first appearance of the ammonite Psiloceras planorbis. ===Wilmcote Limestone=== In certain restricted parts of Britain, the lowermost member of the Blue Lias is the Wilmcote Limestone. It lies above the Cotham Member of the Lilstock Formation and beneath the Saltford Shale Member. The Wilmcote Limestone of central England was formerly quarried close to Stratford-upon-Avon, for example at Wilmcote, Temple Grafton and Binton. It is roughly 200 million years old, dating back to the dawn of the Jurassic Period. Much of the Wilmcote Limestone is very fine-grained, blue-grey when fresh, and very finely layered. Fossils are quite rare, except in the lowest beds. It was formerly used for a variety of purposes, including walling, building, paving, gravestones, cement-making and as a source of agricultural lime. It is no longer quarried, and most of the old quarries are either infilled or overgrown. Geologists think that the Wilmcote Limestone originated as layers of fine-grained mud on the floor of a sheltered, shallow muddy sea or lagoon that covered parts of central England at the dawn of the Jurassic Period. Very little life could tolerate the stagnant conditions on the seabed. As a consequence the mud was seldom disturbed, which is why the fine, paper-like layering is preserved. Above the sea bed, the shallower waters supported ammonites, fish, and marine reptiles (ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs). Their remains were discovered in the Wilmcote Limestone quarries during the nineteenth century. The Warwickshire Museumhttp://heritage.warwickshire.gov.uk/museum-service/ houses a collection of these fossils and some are on display at the Market Hall Museum in Warwick.Ambrose, K., 2001.

Proceedings of the Geologists' Association vol. 112, 97-110.Williams, B.J. & Whittaker, A., 1974. Geology of the Country around Stratford-upon-Avon and Evesham. Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain. HMSO, London. ==Occurrence== The Blue Lias is a prevalent feature of the cliffs around Lyme Regis and Charmouth, on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, where it exists in layers of limestone interspersed with softer clay. It is also notable for its presence in Somerset, particularly around the Polden Hills, Keinton Mandeville and Glastonbury area, and it forms a broad plain across the East Midlands. It also appears near Whitby in Yorkshire and Southam in Warwickshire where a pub is named after it. There are outcrops along the coast of South Wales, notably that of the Vale of Glamorgan.Wilson et al., 1990 Geology of the South Wales Coalfield, Part VI, the country around Bridgend Mem Br Geol Surv sheet 261 & 262 (England and Wales) The type section of the Blue Lias is at Saltford near Bath. ==Use in construction== Lytes Cary, Somerset, built of Blue Lias with Ham stone dressings around the windows Blue Lias is useful as a building stone, and as a source of lime for making lime mortar. Because it is argillaceous, the lime is hydraulic. Since the mid- nineteenth century, it has been used as a raw material for cement, in South Wales, Somerset, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire. The cement plant quarry at Rugby, Warwickshire is probably the best exposure of the formation: more than 100 layers can be seen. In areas where Blue Lias is quarried it has been used in buildings and churches as well as tombstones in cemeteries. An example of a Blue Lias town is Street, near Glastonbury. Other examples of Blue Lias buildings can be found in the nearby towns of Somerton and Ilchester. It remains popular in more modern-day surroundings where it is used in the construction of new housing developments and extensions for existing buildings in conservation areas. Blue Lias is mainly used in flooring, walling and paving slabs ‚Äì both coursed and layered. It is also used in the making of flagstones and cobbles. There are only four quarries in Somerset quarrying Blue Lias at present. AR Purnell at Ashen Cross Quarry in Somerton have been mining blue lias stone since 1996. Hadspen Quarry Ltd. Hadspen Quarry operate one in Keinton Mandeville. Ham & Doulting Stone Co Ltd. operate one of these, Tout Quarry near Somerton. ==Paleofauna== The rock is rich in fossil remains from the Jurassic period.

The Vietnamese name, TƒÉng T·ªëc, as spelled, means \\"speed up\\"; however, if written without accents (i.e., Tang Toc), the name would translate to \\"death and grief\\". For this reason, the company applied for a name change soon after it was licensed. Initially, company chairman H√† H√πng D≈©ng planned to purchase the Viet Airways brand owned by Jetstar Pacific Airlines,Air Speed Up wants to change name .

It is located on the South Rim in Grand Canyon Village, the center of tourist development in the park. The scarcity of water and the high demand for fresh water in the developed areas of the park encouraged the development of a system to treat wastewater so that it could be used for non-potable purposes such as flushing toilets, supplying steam locomotive boilers, irrigation and similar uses. The Grand Canyon water plant was completed in May 1926, producing water that was claimed to be potable (but never used for drinking) at a cost that was one- sixth of the cost for new water. The plant was expanded in 1934 to serve the Bright Angel Lodge. ==Description== The treatment plant consists of a set of bar-screen boxes, a sedimentation tank, three aeration tanks, two clarifiers, one secondary tank, two filters, an approximately holding tank, and a water tank for backwashing filters. The mechanical systems are housed in a two-story frame structure on a concrete base that contains filters, aeration generators and the chlorination system, as well as an office, laboratory and shop. The treatment process passed wastewater through the bar screen, which filtered out large solids, then to a measuring followed by a finer bar screen flume. Solids from the bar screens went to a sludge pond, while coarsely filtered water went to a pre-sedimentation tank, which separated grease and additional solids. An aeration stage allowed aerobic bacteria to work, followed by a pass through clarifier tanks. Filters used anthracite coal to give final clarity, followed by chlorination and storage. The plant operated with its original equipment until it closed. Most of the equipment is original. ==Historic designation== The historic land embraced in this site is a rectangle formed by using the aeration tanks as a center and extending lines 100 yards to the north, 200 yards to the east, 200 yards to the west, and 400 yards to the south. The treatment plant was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 1974. ==References * Category:Sewage treatment plants in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Canyon National Park Category:Buildings and structures in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Grand Canyon history Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Arizona Category:1926 establishments in Arizona Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Water supply infrastructure on the National Register of Historic Places Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coconino County, Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Canyon National Park ","title":"Grand Canyon Water Reclamation Plant"},{"id":"20403870","text":"St. Paul's Episcopal Church, in the Old Town area of Alexandria, Virginia, is an historic Episcopal church in the Anglican Communion. The church sanctuary, consecrated in 1818, was designed by Benjamin Latrobe, the second architect of the United States Capitol. It is one of the few buildings designed by Latrobe in a Gothic style and one of the earliest examples of Gothic Revival architecture in the United States. The church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. During the year 2009, St. Paul's Episcopal Church celebrated the bicentennial of its founding. ==HistoryWilliam Holland Wilmer and the rebuilding of the Episcopal Church in Virginia=== During his term as rector of St. Paul's, 1812-1826, William Holland Wilmer was a major figure in the rebuilding of the Episcopal Church in Virginia in the aftermath of its disestablishment.Bond and Gunderson 2007 pp. 220-231. In addition to founding St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square, in 1815, he wrote extensively on church matters, published numerous sermons on special occasions, and contributed regularly to church publications of the time including the \\"Washington Theological Repertory,\\" which he founded in 1819.Bond and Gunderson 2007 pp. 225-226. In recognition of his many contributions, Wilmer was awarded an honorary doctorate (D.D.) by Brown University in 1820.Knight 1910 p. 477. In 1823, Wilmer obtained permission from the vestry to build at his own expense a small lecture room on church property at the corner of Pitt and Duke Streets. The building was used as a Sunday school, schoolhouse, and lecture room, and also as a town hall. This building was eventually purchased by the vestry and stood until 1855 when the structure was sold and plans were made for a larger replacement. A larger building in Gothic style was constructed on the same site in 1859 that was also used as a Sunday school, lecture hall and meeting place until its demolition in 1955.Kaye 1984 pp. 40-41, 88. While serving as rector of St. Paul's, Wilmer declined calls to serve other churches: St. John's, Lafayette Square, in 1817; and Monumental Church, Richmond, Virginia, in 1826. That year, Wilmer became President of The College of William and Mary and rector of Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg.Kaye 1984 pp. 163-164; Bond and Gunderson 2007 p. 232. ===The founding of Virginia Theological Seminary=== One of Wilmer's continuing concerns was the recruitment and education of clergy. In 1818, he founded the Society for the Education of Young Men for the Ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia and Maryland (Education Society). In 1823, after the Bishop of Maryland withdrew support for the Education Society and an effort to found a seminary in Williamsburg had failed, Wilmer and the Rev. Reuel Keith determined to hold classes in the St. Paul's lecture hall.Kaye 1984 pp. 41, 137; Bond and Gunderson 2007 pp. 229-231. The first class of 14 young men met in the St. Paul's lecture hall that year.Kaye 1984. p. 137. The founding of Virginia Theological Seminary is dated from those classes.VTS History. ===War of 1812 and saving of Alexandria=== Wilmer was part of a three-person delegation that parleyed with British Admiral George Cockburn during the Burning of Washington to save Alexandria from destruction. As result of the negotiations, Cockburn's troops burned Alexandria's docks, seized naval stores and looted warehouses, but did not burn the town.Kaye 1984 p. 163; . ===Sunday school=== The St. Paul's Sunday school was organized in 1818. In England, Sunday schools began in order to educate the industrial poor. The schools taught reading, writing and rudiments of knowledge of the Bible and the liturgy. The Sunday school educated Negroes as well as Whites until the Virginia legislature forbad teaching reading to Negroes after Nat Turner's slave rebellion.Kaye 1984 p. 111. ===Civil War=== St. Paul's Church under military occupation, 1862 Virginia ceded Alexandria as part of the original organization of the District of Columbia, but demanded it back in 1846. The congregation of St. Paul's overwhelmingly supported the Confederacy after Virginia seceded from the Union. The rector at the time, George Hatley Norton, took leave to serve as chaplain with the 17th Virginia Infantry. Though he traveled to Lexington, Virginia, where he remained for the duration of the war, due to ill health, he never served with Confederate forces, but instead took the oath of allegiance to the Union imposed by the martial law authority.Kaye 1984 p. 44. Some of St. Paul's most promising youth, including Randolph Fairfax, confirmed in St. Paul's, died in arms as Confederate soldiers.Kundahl 2004 pp. 207-225; Kaye 1984 p. 59. Union troops occupied Alexandria immediately following the bombardment of Fort Sumter and the town remained subject to military occupation for the duration of the war, even after a loyalist Virginia government was organized in 1863.Kundahl 2004 p. 15. Because the prayer book service made distinct mention of both the executive and the legislative departments of the government, Episcopal clergy were exposed to embarrassment whenever any part of the territory of the Confederate States was occupied by Union forces.Cheshire 1912 ch. 6 An early and particularly notorious incident was the arrest of St. Paul's interim minister, the Rev. Dr. K. J. Stewart, in the sanctuary on February 9, 1862, by Union troops who attended with the stated purpose of provoking an incident.Kaye 1984 pp. 47, 53-54;Cheshire 1912 ch. 6 During the Litany, Dr. Stewart was ordered by an attending Union officer to say the Prayer for the President of the United States that Dr. Stewart had omitted without saying any other prayer in its place. Dr. Stewart proceeded without paying any attention to the interruption; but a captain and six of his soldiers, who were present in the congregation to provoke an incident, drew their swords and pistols, strode into the chancel, seized the clergyman while he was still kneeling, held pistols to his head, and forced him out of the church, and through the streets, just as he was, in his surplice and stole, and committed him to the guard-house of the 8th Illinois Cavalry. Dr. Stewart was soon released, but was not allowed to continue to officiate at services.Cheshire 1912 ch. 6; Kaye 1984 pp. 46-52. Immediately thereafter, the St. Paul's sanctuary was closed and was used for the duration of the War as a hospital for the wounded.Kaye 1984 p. 52. Members with Southern sympathies from St. Paul's, and also members from Christ Church, continued to meet in the St. Paul's lecture hall until it too was closed in 1863 and also used as a hospital until the end of the War in 1865.Kaye 1984 p. 54. When the church regained possession of its buildings in May 1865, they had suffered extensive damage. One month later, on June 23, 1865, the vestry submitted to the Federal occupation force a statement of charges for repairs to restore the church to its former condition. The church was not reimbursed until 1912 for these expenses.Kaye 1984 pp. 61-63 ==Bicentennial observances== In honor of the church's 200th anniversary, St. Paul's has commissioned bicentennial service music composed by William Bradley Roberts, a series of lectures by eminent scholars on various historical subjects relating to worship in the church and its architecture, as well as other celebrations. All of these events culminated in a visit from the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church USA, the Most Reverend Katharine Jefferts Schori. In June 2009, the St. Paul's Choir went on a pilgrimage to England where it performed in St. Paul's Cathedral, Canterbury Cathedral, St. James's Church, Piccadilly, and other venues. ==St. Paul's and controversy in the Episcopal Church19th-century liturgical controversy=== St. Paul's' owes its inception at least in part to the liturgical controversy over vestments and liturgical details that roiled the Episcopal Church during much of the Nineteenth Century.Bond and Gunderson 2007 pp. 278-279. One of the offenses committed by the first rector of St. Paul's, William Lewis Gibson, before his abrupt resignation as rector of Christ Church and the resulting split in that congregation leading to the establishment of St. Paul's was that he chose to wear a white surplice over his cassock during services.Kaye 1984 p. 1. By 1873, the controversy over vestments and ritual accoutrements had become so acute that the Diocese of Kentucky seceded from the Episcopal Church.Bond and Gunderson 2007 p. 279. It is said that if Bishop Francis M. Whittle, Bishop of the Virginia Diocese, and well known in the Church for his opposition to \\"decorations\\" of any kind, had joined the schism, the Episcopal Church would have divided then as it had not in the Civil War.Id. While services at St. Paul's now reflect the Broad Church consensus, services throughout the 19th century were notably less austere than at Christ Church. By the 1880s, the decorations on the St. Paul's altar were a stark contrast to Christ Church that attracted comment.Kaye 1984 pp. 67-68 The divergent liturgical practices within the Diocese of Virginia and the intensity of feelings engendered by that controversy in its time are now recognized by some as precedent for dealing with current rifts in a tolerant and civil manner without schism.Bond and Gunderson 2007 pp. 339-340. ===Civil War=== The Civil War did not produce a formal division of the Episcopal Church, only a substitution of prayers for those in authority. Services in the Confederate States included prayers for the Confederate authorities rather than for the President of the United States.Cheshire Ch. 6. The services otherwise remained the same. In the North, the General Convention of 1862 declined to adopt resolutions that would have denounced the Southern Churchmen as seditious and schismatical.Cheshire 1912 ch. 7. Reconciliation within the Episcopal Church after the Civil War concluded was strained by the suffering and losses of life on both sides during that conflict, but helped to heal by mutual expressions of good will. Within a year of the end of the conflict the dioceses in the South had resolved to resume relations with the dioceses in the Union states. Cheshire ch. 7. A resolution in the Diocese of Virginia to resume relations with the national church was adopted overwhelmingly by both clergy and laity at a meeting of the diocese on May 16, 1866. The meeting that adopted the resolution convened at St. Paul's.Dashiell 1883 pp. 289-290. ===Current rifts and controversies in the Anglican Communion=== Two members of St. Paul's congregation, David Abshire, and The Very Rev. Ian Markham, priest associate and Dean, Virginia Theological Seminary, wrote in 2008 regarding the rifts in the Episcopal Church (United States) and the Anglican Communion arising from controversies in the previous few years. In urging a respect for civility, \\"respect, listening, dialogue, and the possibility of higher ground,\\" Abshire and Markham suggest that civility does not mean giving up what are considered sacred values, but means \\"searching for transcendent values with which to advance the common good.\\" Abshire and Markham 2008. With regard to an alleged abandonment of the final authority of scripture, sola scriptura, Abshire and Markham contend that the final authority of scripture in matters of faith and practice as historically understood in the Roman Catholic Church, in Anglicanism, and by Luther during the Reformation never meant literalism, but attention to the spiritual content of scripture. The literalism of fundamentalist Christianity, as articulated by American Baptists in the early Twentieth Century, is out of place, they contend, in the Anglican tradition, \\"which embraces both faith and reason and a sense of proportion.\\" Anglicanism, they maintain, favors civility in dealing with differences.Id. == Architecture  Latrobe's design === St. Paul's Church Interior, 2008 The design of St. Paul's reflects a close collaboration between Latrobe as architect and William Holland Wilmer (1782‚Äì1827), the second rector of St. Paul's, from February 1812 until October 19, 1826. During his term as rector of St. Paul's, Wilmer also founded St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. and served between 1815 and 1817 as rector of that church also. It was during his term as rector of St. John's that Latrobe designed and supervised the construction of that church in a classical style.Waterman 1938 pp. 21, 29 (data ‚Ä¶/022.gif, ‚Ä¶/030.gif); Bond and Gunderson 2007 p. 221; Kaye 1984 pp. 19, 163. Bushrod Washington, nephew of George Washington, Supreme Court Justice, and an active layman in the St. Paul's congregation may, as a friend of Latrobe, also have had a role in Latrobe's retention as architect by the St. Paul's vestry.Kaye 1984 p. 19; Latrobe 1905 p. 50. Though mainly known for buildings executed in a neoclassical style, including the United States Capitol, the Baltimore Cathedral, and St. John's Episcopal Church, Latrobe had developed a Gothic plan for the Baltimore cathedral as an alternative to the Greco-Roman plan that was selected by Bishop Carroll.Waterman 1938 p. 29-30 (‚Ä¶/031.gif, ‚Ä¶/031.gif). Latrobe's design for the St. Paul's fa√ßade derives from that rejected Gothic plan.Waterman 1938 p. 30 (‚Ä¶/031.gif). The three equal arches in the St. Paul's fa√ßade that rise the full height of the building below the gable create a shallow porch, through which the church is entered.W 031.gif Though clearly differing in scale and ornamental elaboration, the fa√ßade is said to be reminiscent of Peterborough Cathedral. Wilmer favored the Gothic style. Unlike a classical building, a church in Gothic style would recall the fervor of the Medieval English Church and would be free of \\"Popish\\" and pagan connotations.Kaye 1984 p. 163. Latrobe conceived of the interior of the church as a preaching place like the Congregational meeting houses of New England. The preaching space was to be open, unencumbered by piers and columns, with a central pulpit centered on the east wall with only an alcove behind for a chancel.Kaye 1984 p. 29; Waterman 1938 p. 25 (‚Ä¶/026.gif) As conceived by Latrobe, the interior of St. Paul's would afford all in the congregation an unobstructed view of a raised central pulpit in front of the altar.Waterman 1938 p. 25 (‚Ä¶/026.gif). This pure conception was subverted during construction of St. Paul's. At the instigation of the vestry and over Latrobe's strident objections, the builder constructed galleries on the north, south and west sides of the church. Latrobe, however, was correct that members of the congregation in the galleries would be unable to see the pulpit. In 1872, the galleries were modified by raising the pews as if on steps specifically to address that limitation.Kaye 1984 pp. 29-30, 80. With the galleries, St. Paul's is said to be similar to St. James Church, Piccadilly in its overall scheme and scale although simpler and different in architectural style from the Baroque architecture of that church.Kaye 1984 p. 21;Floor plan, St. James Church, Piccadilly. === Later modifications === Over the course of the 19th century, the simplified liturgy with an emphasis on preaching that was prevalent in Virginia when St. Paul's was built gave way in the Episcopal Church and in St. Paul's to a greater emphasis on ritual.Bond and Gunderson 2007 p. 278. By the late 1800s, the high pulpit in front of the altar had been replaced by a pulpit set to the side, and in 1906 the chancel alcove in the Latrobe design was recessed 40 feet.Kaye 1984 pp. 74-75, 69. As a result of further change in liturgical emphasis to give the Eucharist a more central role in worship, the altar was moved in 1968 from the rear of the recessed chancel to its center. At that time, the organ in the chancel was replaced. A new organ constructed by Casavant Fr√®res was installed in the West gallery.Kaye 1984 p. 69-71, 83-84. Throughout, the church fa√ßade has experienced only periodic repairs and has remained true to Latrobe's design.Kaye 1984 p. 65. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Alexandria, Virginia ==NotesReferences== *Abshire, David, and Markham, Ian 2008, ‚ÄúAnglicans Can Find Common Ground at the Cross‚Äù, posted to Web Sept. 12, 2008, retrieved 22 November 2008 *Alexandria Archaeology Museum, Discovering the Decades: 1810s, retrieved 22 November 2008 *Bond, Edward L., and Gunderson, Joan R. 2007, \\"The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607‚Äì2007\\", Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 115, no. 2. *Cheshire, Joseph Blount 1912, The Church in the Confederate States.

His family emigrated to the United States from Belford, France when he was seven and Alexander left home about three years later. He worked as a laborer for several years, mostly in the logging and lumber business, before becoming a teamster, stagecoach driver and freight handler. Toponce headed west when he was about fifteen years old, first to Missouri and then to the northern Intermountain West. There, he ran freight and stagecoach outfits, owned livestock herds, sometimes tried his hand at mining, and invested in all manner of development projects. He is credited with opening or improving many early freight and stage routes throughout the region. Later in life, he mostly invested in mining properties while holding interests in land development companies. Over his lifetime, Toponce made and lost several fortunes, the result of bad weather, Indian raids, unpredictable prices and dishonest partners. Toponce knew, and was known to, a remarkable number and range of pioneers in Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Nevada. In his heyday, he could obtain thousands of dollars in credit on little more than a word and a handshake. At the urging of friends, around 1919 he dictated his Reminiscences, which his wife published after his death. He kept no diary, so he spoke a great deal from memory, with some checking of other sources. A few of his dates are shaky, but Toponce did play a major role in the development of the upper Intermountain West. Moreover, he remained active until just a few months before his death, planning an irrigation and hydroelectric power project. ==Early life== Alexander Toponce was born in Belfort, France, a town located about ten miles from the border with Switzerland. In 1846, his father, Peter, moved the family to the United States. One of Alex's earliest memories concerned the large French stagecoach, known as a diligence, that took them through Paris to the port of Le Havre. Toponce said that, west of Paris, the diligence was unhitched from the team and lifted aboard a railway flatcar. The passengers got back in and the train carried them to the end of the rail line. According to the history of rail transport in France, in 1846 the tracks would have run as far as Rouen. There, the diligence was unloaded and hitched to a new team for the run into Le Havre.Alexander Toponce, Reminiscences of Alexander Toponce, 1917 Edition, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma (1971). Alex got his first lessons in English from sailors on the ship coming over, including ‚Äúall the cuss-words in the language.‚Äù After their arrival in New York City, they took a packet up the Hudson River and linked with a boat on the Erie Canal. They finally settled in Jefferson County, New York. As the second son in the family, Alex found his prospects at home very poor. He attained a better situation chopping wood for another family in the county, a family he identified only as ‚ÄúCarmen.‚Äù Then he worked at a logging camp and sawmill for several years, also learning to handle a team of horses. Around 1854, Toponce and one of the Carmen sons traveled west to near what would become the town of Tipton, Missouri. He gave no specific reason for this change. However, he had surely heard that the Pacific Railroad (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad) was then laying tracks across the state, headed for Tipton and beyond.J. E. Ford, A History of Moniteau County, Missouri, Higginson Book Company, Salem, Massachusetts (1936). They must have seen an opportunity to supply ties to the railroad and lumber for the towns likely to spring up along the route. So they leased a sawmill and began producing planks and timber. There were apparently lulls in demand, because Toponce also found other work during this period. He made two trips to New Orleans to act as a French interpreter for a Tipton dealer in mules and Negro slaves. Toponce also made two trips as a ‚Äúbullwhacker‚Äù on the Santa Fe Trail. He worked for the firm of Russell, Majors and Waddell, for a time the largest freight outfit in the West.Henry Pickering Walker, The Wagonmasters: High Plains Freighting from the Earliest Days of the Santa Fe Trail to 1880, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma (1966). A few years later, the company would operate the famous but short-lived Pony Express. Toponce also helped build stage stations that would later be used by the Butterfield Overland Mail. The Butterfield operation was authorized in late 1857 and began operation on September 15, 1858.LeRoy Reuben Hafen, The Overland Mail, 1849-1869, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma (2004). ==The Utah Expedition== By 1857, Toponce had moved further west as an assistant wagonmaster for Russell, Majors and Waddell, working under contract to the U. S. Army. This was after a couple months early in the year riding an express mail route out of Fort Kearny in Nebraska Territory. The transport firm had responded to an urgent request ‚Äì order, actually ‚Äì from the Army to assemble a massive supply train for a column headed to Utah. The expedition had been dispatched from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to enforce Federal authority in Utah Territory. Among other changes, President James Buchanan planned to replace Brigham Young as governor of the Territory. Young was also president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormons. After some early confusion, Colonel (later General) Albert Sidney Johnston was placed in command of the force. Although no actual battles were fought, the dispute came to be called the Utah War or the Mormon War.Leroy R. Hafen, Ann W. Hafen, The Utah Expedition, 1857-1858, Arthur H. Clark Company, Glendale, California (1958). On October 5, 1857, Mormon raiders burned most of the supply train while it was still eighty miles from Utah. Toponce later asked Lot Smith, the leader of the raiders, why he burned the supplies rather than hauling them back to Utah. Smith said they were afraid the Army would catch them, and that they were supposed to avoid any direct fighting. The lack of supplies and an early onset of bad weather forced the troops, and Toponce, to go into winter quarters. They had a miserable stay near the remnants of Fort Bridger, Wyoming, which the raiders had also burned.Norman F. Furniss, The Mormon Conflict, 1850-1859, Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut (1960). During the Army's long wait for fresh supplies and better weather, cooler heads prevailed and were well on their way to a peaceful solution. When Johnston finally moved in early June, an agreement had been reached and the troops met no resistance. They then established Camp Floyd about thirty miles south of Salt Lake City. The force at Camp Floyd grew slowly, both to keep an eye on the Mormons and to protect the mail route to California. Although the Army still required provisions and other equipment, they had much that was not needed and the contractor no longer had any use for the vast number of wagons and draft animals used when the troops were on the move. Thus, around October, they auctioned off much of that transport while Army quartermasters disposed of other surplus materials and supplies. Toponce himself bought a dozen army mules, many of which he sold at a profit even before he left Utah. He then returned to Missouri and rented a sawmill, which he operated until Abraham Lincoln was elected president. ==Mining in the West== Toponce and most of the men who worked in his sawmill were viewed locally as Northern sympathizers. He and two other men decided Missouri was no place for a Union man. They put together an outfit to hunt for pelts and scout the Colorado gold fields. At Colorado Springs, they heard of mining opportunities near where Breckenridge is today. Their claims produced ‚Äúconsiderable money‚Äù in 1861, which emboldened them to build a mile-long flume to bring water to some new placer claims they had purchased. But the new sites proved short-lived and they lost most of their investment. Thus, in the fall of 1862 and early 1863, Toponce and his partners sold what they had left to James McNassar in Denver. McNassar was well known in Denver and the Colorado gold country.Elizabeth Moriarty, The History of Lake County, Colorado, Colorado State Teachers College, Greeley, Colorado (1930). Oddly enough, he was also a pioneer connected later with Corinne, Utah. Thus, in 1868, McNassar partnered with General Patrick Edward Connor to build the steamer Kate Connor (named for Connor's daughter) to haul supplies across the Great Salt Lake to and from Corinne. As Toponce recalled, the Kate was the first steamboat built to navigate the lake.Frederick M. Huchel, A History of Box Elder County, Utah State Historical Society, Box Elder County Commission, Brigham City, Utah(1999). He also states that he and his wife enjoyed an excursion on the boat, although his ‚Äúearly 80's‚Äù date recollection is incorrect, since the Kate was out of service by 1873.Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah (March 20, 1873). From his Colorado venture, Toponce salvaged just two mules, three horses, a wagon and enough supplies for a long trip. A considerable train, with over 160 gold-seekers, had assembled in Denver and they elected Toponce to be their captain. Although he was just twenty-three years old, he had been doing a man's job for almost a decade. Despite the winter weather ‚Äì they started in early February ‚Äì everyone was anxious to reach the Montana gold fields, which they had heard were rich beyond anything in Colorado. The train pointed north first, avoiding the higher ranges until they entered Wyoming Territory. Toponce then described a route that would have crossed the divide at Bridger Pass, a point about twenty miles southwest of the modern town of Rawlins, Wyoming. They joined the normal Oregon Trail route near Fort Bridger. The train generally followed the Trail until they were south of old Fort Hall, where they left the main route to head north. They crossed to the west side of the Snake River near the mouth of the Blackfoot River, using a ferry run by Jacob Meeks and John P. Gibson.Larry R. Jones, ‚ÄúSnake River Ferries,‚Äù Reference Series No. 54, Idaho State Historical Society (October 1982). The train, which had grown to about 180 people, arrived at Bannack, Montana on May 14, 1863. Quite a few pioneers who were later prominent in Western development accompanied Toponce on this journey. Perhaps the most famous was Enos A. Wall, who was just a year older than Alex. Originally from North Carolina, Wall later successfully operated gold and silver mines in Montana, Idaho and Utah. In 1882, he served a term in the Idaho legislature.Ben Ysursa, Idaho Blue Book, 2003-2004, The Caxton Printers, Ltd., Caldwell, Idaho (2003). But Wall made his fortune in Utah copper mining, and later sold his holdings for $2.7 million. He died in 1920, three years before Toponce.Allen K. Powell (ed.), Utah History Encyclopedia, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, Utah (1994). All the best ground around Bannack was claimed, so Toponce followed the rush to Alder Gulch, where Virginia City, Montana was soon founded. The returns from his Alder Gulch claim were very good, but not spectacular. Thus, in the fall he and Enos Wall packed supplies and their gold dust on two wagons and headed south to Utah. ==Hauling Freight== Shopping around near Salt Lake City, Toponce and Wall bought eight wagons with teams and stocked them with flour, tea, butter and mining tools. Alex also purchased a huge dressed hog from a butcher in Brigham City, Utah. The night time temperature quickly froze the carcass so it arrived in good shape when they got back to Virginia City on the day before Christmas. He had paid 6¬¢ a pound for the meat and butcher Alexander Metzel paid him a dollar a pound for it. Metzel was another of the many men Toponce associated with who later became famous in the region. The butcher soon bought a ranch about fifteen miles from Virginia City and moved there full-time in 1872. Over the years, he greatly improved the breeds of his cattle and horses. He eventually owned one of the most prosperous livestock operations in Montana. Metzel also served three terms in the Montana legislature. He died in 1899.Progressive Men of the State of Montana, A. W. Bowen & Company, Chicago, Illinois (ca 1903). Shortly after Toponce returned to Montana, the Montana Vigilantes began their efforts to suppress rampant crime.Michael P. Malone, Richard B. Roeder, and William L. Lang, Montana: A History of Two Centuries, Revised Edition, University of Washington Press, Seattle (1991). He apparently did not witness the execution of George Ives, but heard much about it. Then, having disposed of his goods and most of his teams, he headed south again. While Toponce took no part in the hangings, he considered them necessary. In fact, in his Reminiscences, he stated categorically that they had not done enough. He said that fully half of those who were only banished should have also been hung right then. In fact, many were hung later, when they began to prey on crews building the transcontinental railroad. After a tough winter-time trip, Toponce led a new supply train to Montana in the spring of 1864. Turning that over during the summer, he tried to make another trip in the fall. However, he was delayed in getting started and ended up losing 175 head of cattle to bad weather. While not disastrous, the loss crippled his profits for the year. By then, gold had been discovered further north in what was called Last Chance Gulch. The resulting gold camp soon took the name Helena, Montana. So Toponce recouped some of his losses by hacking a road over a local divide to deliver the first large train of supplies for the miners there. With Helena as a destination, Toponce looked for opportunities to haul freight from ports on the upper Missouri River. Fort Benton, Montana was the closest steamboat landing, but low water often blocked boat traffic to it. Alex's first contract called for him to haul government supplies from Fort Buford, over four hundred miles further down the river. His first venture went very well, with added profit from carrying supplies for the local Indian agent on into Helena. His second trip, again with a government contract, also went well, except for one episode of potentially deadly danger. Toponce's initial success had attracted competitors, one of them being the Diamond R transport company. ‚ÄúColonel‚Äù Charles Arthur Broadwater was manager of the Diamond R train. He had been known in Colorado and then in Virginia City before being appointed to lead the train. At the time, he was also courting the young lady he would later marry, and Alex knew both of them. With their trains moving along well, Broadwater wanted to raced ahead, traveling only at night to avoid possible Indian parties. All went well until, not having seen any sign of Indians, they rode a leg during the day and ran into a considerable band. They put on a bold face, so the warriors only made them trade their outstanding saddle horses for a couple of scrawny scrubs. Broadwater later became a prominent leader in Montana politics (Broadwater County is named for him), railroad building and banking. He also promoted the famous Broadwater Hotel and Natatorium in Helena. Toponce's third expedition for the government also did well, although they had to endure a serious Indian attack. However, he then tried a speculation on his own that ran afoul of even stronger Indian attacks and a severe blizzard. He began the venture with $75,000 in gold as well as his wagon train. When he finally returned to Helena in late June, 1866, he owned one mule and had to borrow $200 to pay off his men. But back in Salt Lake City, a local merchant persuaded him to buy, on credit, a train of twenty-six wagons that he had no further use for. Toponce then got further credit from the merchant to load the wagons with freight for Montana. The merchant made money and Toponce came away from the deal with plenty of cash for another venture. During 1866-1867, Toponce took a flyer on eggs, buying them up all over northern Utah. Back in Montana, he sold them at a considerable profit to merchant George L. Shoup. Shoup later became one of the largest cattle ranchers in Idaho, the last governor of Idaho Territory and first for the new state, and then served as a U. S. Senator. ==Branching Out== By the summer of 1867, Toponce was well off again. But in a quest for self-sufficiency, Brigham Young had begun encouraging church members to trade only with Mormon merchants. That led to an actual boycott of Gentile stores in 1866, and had a dampening effect for several years.Thomas G. Alexander, James B. Allen, Mormons and Gentiles: A History of Salt Lake City, Pruett Publishing Company, Boulder, Colorado (1984) Many Gentile merchants that Alex had dealt with were left ‚Äúholding the bag‚Äù on goods they could not sell. Two of them, one being the Utah Territorial Governor Charles Durkee, approached Toponce for help. Alex bought a one-third interest in the goods and then peddled them to stores all over central Utah. Self-sufficiency might be good in theory, but these storekeepers simply could not pass up the chance. Mostly, he took cattle or local goods in trade since hardly anyone had much cash or even gold dust on hand. He ended up with about 6,000 head of cattle, which he and a crew then trailed into Nevada. He sold most of the cattle to a consortium of butchers who served the camps of the Comstock Lode. He also sold a pair of fine trotting horses to William Sharon, manager of the local Bank of California branch and later U. S. Senator for the state of Nevada. In May, 1868, Toponce settled up and returned to Salt Lake City. He and his partners figured they were good to the tune of $100,000 each. With plenty of capital to work with, Toponce now began selling railroad ties, beef and other supplies to the Union Pacific. The eastern leg of the transcontinental railroad was then into Wyoming and would cross the Utah border in late 1868. Alex himself was there at the Golden Spike ceremony when the two leg met on May 10, 1869. In fact, he borrowed a shovel and threw some dirt on the ties for the final-day stretch ‚Äújust to tell about it afterward.‚Äù Having found ranching to his liking, Toponce went mainly into raising cattle and horses for the next five or six years. With a base in Garland, Utah, he filled beef contracts, and sold horses and mules to customers in southern Idaho down to Salt Lake City. Also, on September 18, 1870 Alex married widow Kate (Beach) Collins. Although later newspaper reports often said she was the first white child born in Utah, Toponce's Reminiscences explicitly say she was the fourth. Still, when he wrote his memoir, she was the oldest living white woman born in Utah. Toponce counted many prominent leaders of the LDS church among his customers and suppliers. That included Brigham Young, whom he considered ‚Äúthe squarest man to do business with in Utah.‚Äù Others included Heber C. Kimball, one of the original members of the LDS Quorum of the Twelve; William Henry Hooper, Delegate to the U. S. Congress from Utah Territory; and John Taylor, who later succeeded Brigham Young as President of the church. Besides those, the notorious Porter Rockwell, frontier marshal and bodyguard to LDS founder Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, ‚Äútook a fancy‚Äù to Alex. Yet despite his many contacts in the church, Toponce never became a Mormon himself. Despite the preponderance of Mormons, Toponce had an eclectic blend of religious friends. He often rode in a stagecoach with Episcopal Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle, who later served as Presiding Bishop of the U. S. Episcopal Church. Alex was hugely impressed with Tuttle's common touch, recalling when he treated two fellow passengers, dancehall girls, as ‚Äúqueens in disguise.‚Äù Toponce was equally impressed by Methodist minister Thomas Corwin Iliff, later Trustee of the Iliff School of Theology in Denver. In early 1871, Toponce entered into another joint venture to dispose of merchandise for a Gentile merchant. That exchange left them with over 9,000 head of Texas cattle on their hands, so Alex leased range on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho. Toponce ran his Idaho cattle operation for about seven years before selling out to cattleman John Sparks. Sparks, with various partners, would eventually own one of the largest cattle operations in Idaho and Nevada. He would be elected to two terms as Nevada governor. In yet another venture in 1873, Toponce and three partners built a canal from the Malad River south into Corinne. The canal mostly provided power for a grist mill in the town, although there was some flow left over for irrigation. Toponce and another set of partners also started a charcoal kiln in Wyoming, shipping the fuel to the lead-silver smelters operating east of Salt Lake City.Eileen Hallet Stone, Historic Tales of Utah, The History Press, Charleston, South Carolina (2016). In 1878-1881, the Utah and Northern Railway finally connected northern Utah with Butte, Montana. During the years of construction, the railroad steadily took business away from the animal-powered freight companies. Thus, over the course of the decade, Toponce had phased out that part of his business, although he continued to lease trains to other operators. However, in 1879, major gold finds in Custer County, Idaho brought thousands of prospectors into the area. It also drew the interest of George Hearst,Merle W. Wells, Gold Camps & Silver Cities, 2nd Edition, Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, Moscow, Idaho (1983) father of William Randolph Hearst. Toponce had known Hearst in connection with the Ontario silver mine in Park City, Utah. Although the Ontario eventually made a fortune for Hearst, the initial development costs severely strained his resources. Toponce was one of those who loaned him money when, as Alex put it, ‚Äúthe rent came round.‚Äù Spurred by Hearst's interest, Toponce recruited some partners and built the first wagon road into the boomtown of Bonanza from Challis. He also established a stage line from Challis out to Blackfoot, providing a link with the railroad. Later, he opened a branch line to Bellevue. After three years, a competitor underbid him on the mail contract so he sold the business. Toponce's venture in central Idaho led him back into mining, as he furnished ‚Äúgrubstakes‚Äù to hopeful prospectors. Of course, few such investments paid off in any big way, but Alex did have one or two good hits. ==Investor and Developer== In 1883, to combine resources and reduce administrative costs, Toponce and four other investors formed the Corinne Mill, Canal and Stock Company. Alex's contribution included his interest in the Corinne canal and grist mill, as well as his ranch, including the livestock there. He was named Vice President of the company. The president was a friend and business associate of Toponce's, going back to 1864. The company invested in land, some of which they developed slightly and sold, and some of which they used to expand their livestock herds. Trying to close one major land deal, they enlisted the help of Toponce's ‚Äúvery good friend,‚Äù Utah Governor Eli Murray. The governor hoped to encourage Gentile settlement of the area, but questions about water rights torpedoed the deal. But in 1886, while Toponce and one other director were out of town, the president and the two other directors devised a subterfuge that dissolved the company in their favor. Since most of Toponce's assets had been tied up in the firm, he was essentially broke. And, after over seven years of litigation, so were the stock manipulators. Toponce won his case against them, but could collect only a $20,000 bond that had been posted early in the proceedings. Meanwhile, Toponce's good credit and other assets kept him afloat. He started a new livestock operation and apparently handled a number of different construction and development projects. In 1887, he was elected mayor of Corinne, a job he handled with cleverness and good humor. Within a few years, Toponce's investment in a mine near Shoup, Idaho provided a good return, although it did not become a long-time money-maker.‚ÄúLooks Well on Salmon,‚Äù Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah (May 19, 1892); Idaho Register, Idaho Falls, Idaho (November 16, 1894); Salt Lake Mining Review (August 15, 1918). Around the turn of the century, Toponce tried to make a splash with a big livestock deal. He bought up over 2,600 horses, plus 150 mules, in Nevada, paying rock-bottom prices because most of the animals were totally wild and poorly fed. He planned to drive them east into Nebraska or Kansas, moving slowly enough so they could fatten on the grassy plains. Along the way, they would be broken to riding and harness. ‚ÄúBroke‚Äù horses and mule were worth ten to fifty times what Alex had paid for them.‚ÄúA Big Horse Deal,‚Äù Record-Union, Sacramento, California (May 4, 1899). But Alex seems to have been seriously injured on this venture and, for a man of sixty years, the aftereffects may have been very serious.‚ÄùToponce Injured,‚Äù Idaho Register, Idaho Falls, Idaho (January 11, 1901); Salt Lake Telegram, Salt Lake City, Utah (May 13, 1903). Toponce did not mention these events in his Reminiscences, but it was quite some time before his name appeared in the newspapers again. Most of Toponce's projects in his final years involved irrigation and hydroelectric power.‚ÄúNew Power Company,‚Äù Salt Lake Telegram, Salt Lake City, Utah (November 4, 1914); Idaho Falls Times, Idaho Falls, Idaho (April 20, 1916). Thus, in 1920, a reporter marveled at Toponce's energy in pursuing a substantial water project at the age of eighty-one.‚ÄúEighty-One-Year-Old Pioneer ‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù Wyoming State Tribune, Cheyenne, Wyoming (April 20, 1920). That was about two years after Alex began dictating the Reminiscences for his wife to record. According to the original edition, he completed the effort before his eightieth birthday, but encountered obstacles in getting it published. Toponce continued to work on an irrigation project in Wyoming, but suffered heart problems in February 1923.‚ÄúIll at Home,‚Äù Ogden Standard-Examiner, Ogden, Utah (February 11, 1923). He apparently never fully recovered and died on May 13, 1923.‚ÄúWestern Pioneer Dies,‚Äù Idaho Statesman, Boise Idaho (May 15, 1923). ==Legacy== Toponce Creek, located about twenty miles east of Pocatello, Idaho, was named for Alexander after he ranged cattle in the area. His memoir, The Reminiscences of Alexander Toponce, is surely his largest legacy. A Google Scholar search for ‚ÄúAlexander Toponce‚Äù generated nearly sixty hits. The range of books and articles that cited his document includes several ‚ÄúOld West‚Äù histories, Episcopal Church history, mining history, Camp Floyd in Utah, vigilante activities, water resources, early freighting, and much, much more. ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1923 deaths Category:American pioneers Category:People from Ogden, Utah Category:People from Belfort Category:People of the Utah War Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:Pony Express riders Category:People from Garland, Utah ","title":"Alexander Toponce"},{"id":"20403881","text":"Inherent Vice is a novel by American author Thomas Pynchon, originally published in August 2009. A darkly comic detective novel set in 1970s California, the plot follows sleuth Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello whose ex-girlfriend asks him to investigate a scheme involving a prominent land developer. Themes of drug culture and counterculture are prominently featured. Critical reception was largely positive, with reviewers describing Inherent Vice as one of Pynchon's more accessible works. The novel was adapted into a 2014 film of the same name. ==Plot summary== The setting is Los Angeles in 1970; the arrest and trial of the Manson Family is featured throughout the novel as a current event. Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello, private investigator and pothead, receives a visit from his former girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth, now having an affair with the real-estate mogul Michael Z. \\"Mickey\\" Wolfmann. Shasta asks Doc to help foil a plot allegedly hatched by Mickey's wife Sloane and her lover, Riggs Warbling, to have Mickey admitted to a mental health institution. Soon afterwards a black militant named Tariq Khalil asks Doc to find Glen Charlock, one of Mickey's bodyguards‚ÄîTariq claims that Glen owes him money after their time spent together in prison. Doc visits one of Mickey's developments but is knocked unconscious, and awakes to find himself being questioned by his old LAPD nemesis, Det. Christian F. \\"Bigfoot\\" Bjornsen, who informs Doc that Glen Charlock has been shot dead and that Mickey has vanished. Later, Doc is visited by Hope Harlingen, the widow of a musician named Coy Harlingen, who wants Doc to investigate rumours that Coy is still alive. Doc finds Coy in a nightclub, but upon hearing that Doc is investigating Mickey, Coy tells Doc about the Golden Fang, an old schooner suspected of bringing mysterious goods into port, and upon which both Mickey and Shasta are rumoured to have departed. Doc learns that Coy has been working for the government as an informer and agent provocateur, but is allowed no contact with his family. He also discovers that one Puck Beaverton had switched shifts with Glen Charlock on the day of Glen's death, and that Mickey had been working at the time of his disappearance on a plan to atone for his sins as a ruthless entrepreneur. Doc pays a visit to the HQ of Golden Fang Enterprises where he meets Japonica Fenway, a young runaway whom Doc had returned to her wealthy parents on a previous occasion. Japonica reveals that she has stayed at a clinic named the Chryskylodon Institute. Doc visits the Institute, where he again encounters Coy Harlingen, and deduces that Mickey has been apprehended by persons unknown. Doc is then told that the attack during which Glen Charlock was shot was carried out by a group of vigilantes who are said to do dirty work for the LAPD. Doc then discovers links between Puck Beaverton and a notorious loan shark named Adrian Prussia. After a visit from Trillium Fortnight, a female companion of Puck's, Doc travels to Las Vegas in search of Puck and Trillium's sexual threesome partner, Einar. In Las Vegas, Doc places a bet with the manager of the Kismet Lounge, Fabian Fazzo, that Mickey did not fake his own disappearance. Later, Doc believes that he sees Mickey in the company of federal agents, and subsequently hears of Mickey's scheme for a philanthropic housing project in the desert. Doc visits the site and encounters Riggs Warbling, architect of the housing project, who fears that Mickey has been \\"reprogrammed\\" and that the development, already abandoned, will be destroyed. Back in Los Angeles, Doc learns that Puck Beaverton and Bigfoot's former policing partner, Vincent Indelicato, were sworn enemies. Adrian Prussia, who was used by the authorities as an unofficial assassin, effectively immune from the law, and who employed Puck, permitted Puck to murder Vincent. Doc visits Adrian, who claims that he is behind the Golden Fang organization, while Puck contends that Glen was killed deliberately because he was supplying black- power groups with weapons. Doc is handcuffed and about to be given a lethal drug overdose, but escapes and kills both Puck and Adrian. Bigfoot, who has evidently been using Doc to investigate Vincent's death, picks Doc up, but sets him up with a huge quantity of stolen heroin. Doc performs a in order to hide the drugs and is later contacted by Crocker Fenway (father of Japonica) who acts as an intermediary for the Golden Fang. Doc arranges a handover, his only condition being that Coy is released from all of his obligations and allowed to return to his family. After the handover has taken place, Doc and his lawyer Sauncho hear that the Golden Fang schooner is leaving port. Along with the Coast Guard, they pursue the vessel, and watch as it is abandoned after encountering an enormous surf wave. Sauncho and Doc then decide to place a claim on the schooner. At the end of the novel, Doc receives a payment from Fabian Fazzo in settlement of his bet about Mickey. He also learns that Coy has been reunited with Hope and their child, Amethyst. ==Reviews== Critics reacted well to Inherent Vice, particularly for its mainstream appeal. In a generally favorable review, The New York Times Michiko Kakutani called it \\"Pynchon Lite\\", describing it as \\"a simple shaggy-dog detective story that pits likable dopers against the Los Angeles Police Department and its 'countersubversive' agents, a novel in which paranoia is less a political or metaphysical state than a byproduct of smoking too much weed\\". A review by academic Louis Menand in The New Yorker declared the novel \\"a generally lighthearted affair\\", while adding that there were still \\"a few familiar apocalyptic touches, and a suggestion that countercultural California is a lost continent of freedom and play, swallowed up by the faceless forces of co- optation and repression\\". In a scathing review in New York magazine, Sam Anderson wrote that \\"with no suspense and nothing at stake, Pynchon's manic energy just feels like aimless invention\\". Pynchon promoted the book with a video trailer, released before the hardback. The video featured Pynchon narrating as Doc, accompanied by footage of the book's California locale and period music. == Film adaptation == In early 2011, it was reported that Academy Award-nominated writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, The Master) would adapt Inherent Vice into a feature film. The film features Joaquin Phoenix, the lead from Anderson's 2012 film The Master, and is narrated by Joanna Newsom. On September 29, 2014, the first trailer and a poster for the film were released by Warner Bros.. The film opened in the United States on December 12, 2014 to positive reviews. The film followed the novel closely, with multiple instances of dialogue taken directly from the page. Some changes, however, include that Anderson positions Sortil√®ge (Newsom), a minor character in the novel, as the film's narrator. Meanwhile, Doc's entire trip to Las Vegas is wholly excluded. ==References== * Online Business Dictionary (accessed 1 December 2008).

It was located at Ringsted on the Danish island of Zealand. == History The first Ringsted Abbey=== Ringsted was one of Denmark's earliest towns and in Viking times a center for worship. The town had a royal mint in 1020 and a Benedictine priory was established by King Sven Estridsen before his death in 1076, but not completed until 1081 or 1082 under Svend Norbagge, Bishop of Roskilde. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The first priory church was constructed out of limestone. According to tradition the monks were brought by the king from one of his campaigns in Britain. Ringsted Abbey owed its importance to its being the resting place of Knud Lavard who was murdered at Haraldsted forest just north of Ringsted in 1131 and was canonized in 1170 as Saint Knud Lavard. ===The second Ringsted Abbey=== It is unclear what happened to the original priory, but in 1135 King Erik Emune refounded Ringsted Priory with Benedictine monks from Odense. The abbey received its recognition by Pope Innocent II in 1138. St. Mary's Church (Danish: Sct Maria Kirke) is the oldest brick church in Scandinavia, a successor to the travertine church of 1080. Knud Lavard's bones were moved into a new chapel in the priory church at Ringsted in 1157 with the approval of his son, King Valdemar I of Denmark. The church became an immediate pilgrimage site. With the funds raised from pilgrims and royal patronage the abbey church was expanded and dedicated in 1170 with great ceremony. Subsequently Ringsted Priory became the location of the burials of many of Valdemar's descendants from 1182 until 1341. King Valdemar Sejr and Queen Dagmar were buried there. The church was later renamed St. Bendt's Church (Sankt Bendts Kirke). For centuries, the church served as the monastery church. After the Reformation in 1571 it became a parish church. Ringsted Priory became an abbey in the mid-13th century and by that time was so influential that its abbot was a permanent member of the State Council (Danish: Rigsr√•d) which advised Denmark's kings until the Reformation. His rank was equal to that of the bishops. Ringsted Abbey enjoyed almost continuous royal support as well as that of the most powerful noble families and bishops of Denmark. Its royal connections brought it extensive land holdings in Zealand and other parts of Denmark. The abbey also had papal protections and in 1193 received permission to hold mass even when Denmark lay under interdict as happened periodically in the stormy years of the 13th century. The abbey suffered damaging fires in 1241 and 1300, but with the amount of income available quickly rebuilt. ===Post Protestant Reformation=== Denmark became a Protestant nation with the adoption of the Lutheran Ordinances in October 1536. Ringsted once again received special treatment. All other monastic houses were closed, but Ringsted remained open, though under the direction of a Lutheran superintendent. The monks eventually abandoned their abbey with some travelling south to join other Benedictine houses in Germany. In time the abbey and all its properties reverted to the crown. Unfortunately, during the Reformation the entire archive of the monastery was destroyed. The national archives contain a few letters from the 15th century and bit of the Ringsted Book which outlines monetary privileges.

Turner also contributed lap steel guitar to a variety of Wishbone Ash recordings. ==CareerPre-Wishbone Ash=== Prior to Wishbone Ash, Turner played with the Birmingham band, King Biscuit. ===Wishbone Ash=== Turner joined Wishbone Ash in 1969, leaving after their fourth album, Wishbone Four, in 1974. His main guitar during this period was a maple necked Fender Stratocaster. He also used a Gibson Les Paul and vintage lap steel guitars. Wishbone Ash also used the early Orange/Matamp amplifiers during this period. In 1971, Turner was invited to play on John Lennon's Imagine, on \\"Crippled Inside\\" and \\"How Do You Sleep\\" ===Post-Wishbone Ash=== In the spring of 1974, Ted left Wishbone Ash and the music business to travel the world. By 1975 he had found his way to New Orleans and into the 'World Man Band' project, an attempt to raise global consciousness through rock music based upon information from R. Buckminster Fuller working with Michael Mitchell.Later that same year, Turner moved to Los Angeles to record, write and produce music artists including George Harrison, Billy Preston and Al Stewart. In 1980, Turner returned to England and did studio work with Stewart Copeland, Gene October, and Brian James. The next year found him once again in the United States, where he married and formed a new band. Called \\"Choice\\", it featured Greg Cook (guitars, keyboards, and vocals), Robbie Hewlett (bass guitar) and Bobby Dean Wickland (drums). In 1982, Ted joined the re-formed \\"Badfinger\\" and toured the country with them. From 1983 to 1985, Turner was involved in various recording projects with such artists as Brian Auger and Rod Stewart. In 1985 he moved to Chicago, recorded with various artistes including Sugar Blue. ===Rejoining Wishbone Ash=== In 1987 he rejoined Wishbone Ash and with them recorded \\"Nouveau Calls\\" for Miles Copeland III's No Speak label. In the spring of 1988, the original Wishbone Ash toured England and Europe for the first time in 15 years, and in the autumn of that year Turner and Andy Powell were invited to join Copeland's \\"Night of the Guitar\\" tour. That group included such guitar legends as Randy California, Peter Haycock, Steve Howe, Steve Hunter, Robby Krieger, Leslie West, Alvin Lee and Jan Akkerman. ===Later work=== Turner continued to tour and record with Wishbone Ash until 1994, when he once again decided to depart. In that same year, he suffered ‚Äì and witnessed ‚Äì the loss of his son Kipp, who was killed by a drunk driver in Scottsdale, Arizona. He now has a daughter Sloane. He has also made guest appearances with Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash, led by Wishbone Ash's founding original member bassist/vocalist Martin Turner (no relation) including a performance at the High Voltage Festival in London's Victoria Park in July 2010.

ORDEN helped control the 1972 elections, in which reform-minded Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte lost to Arturo Armando Molina (of Rivera's party, the Party of National Conciliation (PCN)) due to fraud. ==History== ORDEN was originally established in 1961 as a civil defense apparatus, composed of army reserve units and commandeered peasants. According to the Human Rights Institute of the Central American University, one of ORDEN's principal functions initially was to identify and eliminate purported communists among the rural population.Popkin, Margaret. Peace Without Justice (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000) Under Colonel Jose Alberto Medrano's command, ORDEN was transformed into a highly organized militia force, with military officers in command at the department level, non-commissioned officers coordinating actions from municipal centers, and many members drawn from army reservists and retired National Guard and Treasury Police officers. ORDEN functioned the intelligence-gathering instrument of the Salvadoran armed forces (FAES) while also acting in anti-insurgent operations and helping in military recruitment. Its structure was composed of senior military officers directly responsible to the president, and it functioned as the brain of a security network that spanned the entire country, providing information and coordinating the activities of death squads.Stanley, William. The Protection Racket State Elite Politics, Military Extortion, and Civil War in El Salvador (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996)Library of Congress 1990, 229 In 1965, all of El Salvador's military, paramilitary, and other forces were synchronized under one system: ANSESAL, or Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Salvadore√±a (National Security Agency of El Salvador). A 1983 report said that one in five people in El Salvador were informers for ANSESAL. After 1967, its existence and function was made public and it served to strengthen the base of support for the PCN, which won all the elections between 1962 and 1969. The importance of ORDEN lay in its being an organization composed of peasants and farmers responsible for repressing their own class. In 1967, the paramilitary organization mobilized over 100,000 people. After the election of Fidel S√°nchez Hern√°ndez, also in 1967, the president took control of ORDEN. ORDEN penetrated every hamlet in the country and, according to Americas Watch, \\"is widely recognized as one of the precursors of the 'death squads' of the late 1970s and 1980s.\\" During the 1970s ORDEN units frequently participated with the military and security forces in the torture and killing of unarmed government opponents, and was accused of engaging in widespread repression by both the U.S. State Department and the Organization of American States (OAS).Associated Press, Eduardo Vazquez Becker.

Carlos Humberto Romero the government relied heavily on ORDEN to repress opposition in rural areas. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS issued a report which indicated that ORDEN was terrorizing peasants throughout the country as part of the military's overall policy of repression, and that ORDEN was involved in a number of extrajudicial killings and acts of torture. Moreover, a March 1980 report by Amnesty International to the Inter-American Commission contained seven pages of incidents in which the military, security forces or ORDEN were responsible for killing unarmed civilians. There were reports in the late 1970s of ORDEN and National Guard forces killing civilian opponents of the government with machetes, sometimes brutally hacking them to death and leaving them out in the open as a warning to other activists.Riding, Alan.

Voting in El Salvador was obligatory for every citizen, and those who did not comply were subject to intimidation by security forces and armed political factions. ORDEN was heavily involved in coercing the civilian population into voting for General Romero in the February 1977 elections, reportedly using machetes to terrorize the general's opponents into submission and force citizens to vote for Romero.Armstrong, Robert / Shenk, Janet. El Salvador: The Face of Revolution (Boston: South End Press, 1982), 163Americas Watch March 1982, 71-72Bonner 1984, 59, 84, 93 ORDEN also coordinated and directed repressive actions against the clergy. In just four months between February and May 1977, 17 priests were expelled or forced to flee the country, four imprisoned and tortured, and six killed. These actions were both coordinated and carried out by ORDEN. In November 1979, ORDEN was officially decommissioned by the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador as part of a program of human rights reform. However, with the escalation of civil tensions and the resignation of the last civilian members of the junta, the military unofficially reactivated ORDEN. ORDEN subsequently resumed its normal functions, as an intelligence gathering agency and a repressive apparatus, and continued to be a principal auxiliary to conventional forces in El Salvador. On May 14, 1980, ORDEN participated with the National Guard and units of Military Detachment No. 1 in a large massacre at the Rio Sumpul, in which an estimated 600 civilians were killed, mostly women and children. When the villagers were attempting to escape violence by crossing the river they were prevented from reaching the other side by the Honduran armed forces \\"and then killed by Salvadorian troops who fired on them in cold blood.\\"\\"Sumpul River (1980) 121\\" Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador, 1 April 1993 Peasants who survived the massacre later described to visiting foreign delegations of inquiry how Salvadoran soldiers and ORDEN members gathered children and babies together, threw them into the air and slashed them to death with machetes. ==See also== *Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil (PACs, or Civilian Self Defense Patrols): Guatemala *Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC, or United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia): Colombia ==References *History Commons Democratic Nationalist Organization (ORDEN).

Based on comments in the text it appears to have been written not long after the Peloponnesian War. It is intended to help an individual gain a deeper understanding of an issue by forcing them to consider it from the angle of their opponent, which may serve either to strengthen their argument or to help the debaters reach compromise. In ancient Greece, students of rhetoric would be asked to speak and write for both sides of a controversy. All surviving manuscript copies of Dissoi Logoi are appended to manuscripts of the works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus whose works describe the use of arguments for both sides of a controversy for generating epoche, suggesting a strong connection with Pyrrhonist thought.Sebastiano Molinelli, Dissoi Logoi: A New Commented Edition http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/12451/1/Dis._Log..pdf?DDD3+ Dissoi Logoi was first published by Stephanus in 1570, as an appendix to his edition of Diogenes La√´rtius, and it is found here divided into five chapters. Thomas Gale first published a version of it with a commentary of its own, in 1671. The first edition with an apparatus criticus was published by Ernst Weber in 1897.Robinson, T.M. \\"Contrasting Arguments\\" pp.1-15. Arno Press. 1979 ==History== The composition date of the work is unknown. Scholars look to the text to piece out clues as to its origin, but find that even this is ambiguous at best. One possible way to date the work is its mention of the offspring of Polyclitus, a well known Greek sculptor. In the Dissoi Logoi (section 6.8) it states that Polyclitus taught his son (singular) virtue or ·ºÄœÅŒµœÑŒÆ. Yet in Protagoras' 328c, the usually attentive Plato claims Polyclitus to have in fact two sons, not just one. The Protagoras's dramatic events are conventionally dated to between 429 and 422 BC, so either one of the authors made a mistake in listing the genealogy of Polyclitus, or the Dissoi Logoi was written before Polyclitus had another son, thus dating it to before the 420s BC.Robinson, T.M. \\"Contrasting Arguments\\" pp.34-35. Arno Press. 1979 Another interesting reference possibly dating the text is its mention of a victory of Sparta over Athens and her allies at section 1.8. At face value, most tend to accept this as a reference to the Peloponnesian War, and thus claim that the Dissoi Logoi must have been written after this war's terminal date, 404 BC. While this is most probably true, it is by no means sure, because there are other instances of Spartan victory over Athens which add uncertainty to this dating, such as the Battle of Tanagra in 457 BC. Thus the Dissoi Logoi are generally dated to between the 5th and early 4th centuries BC.Robinson, T.M. \\"Contrasting Arguments\\" pp.35-37. Arno Press. 1979 The work is largely written in the Doric dialect, but contains small examples of the Attic and Ionian dialects as well.Bailey, D.T.J. 2008. \\"Excavating the Dissoi Logoi 4\\". Oxfort Studies in Ancient Philosophy: 249-64 One possible author is the Pyrrhonist philosopher Zeuxis. Diogenes La√´rtius reportedLives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers IX 106 that Zeuxis was a friend of Aenesidemus and that he wrote a work titled Dissoi Logoi.Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy p. 107 ==Interpretation== Dissoi Logoi, also called dialexeis, is a two-fold argument, which considers each side of an argument in hopes of coming to a deeper truth. The dissoi logoi doctrine provides historical insight into early sophistic rhetoric. Silvermintz notes that while dissoi logoi purports to offer a consideration of both the absolutist and relativist positions, the latter chapters defending the sophists demonstrate its allegiance to the relativist position. It is similar to a form of debate with oneself and holds that contradiction is an inevitable consequence of discourse. Rhetorician John Poulakos sees dissoi logoi as the ability or practice of providing a contrary argument at any point on any issue. He says that people must be persuaded to one side or the other in order to act, and this is accomplished through dissoi logoi. It considers demonstrating contrasting arguments in a single oration a method of demonstrating skill. Protagoras stated that every argument had two contradicting sides, both of which could be argued. This idea emphasizes the power and versatility of language. A definite parallel can be drawn between the thoughts of Protagoras as recounted by Plato, and the rhetorical methods used in the Dissoi Logoi.Gera, D.L. Two Thought Experiments in the Dissoi Logoi.The American Journal of Philology121(1): 21-45 Aristotle supported this idea by stating that it is necessary to think in opposites to anticipate counterarguments and to arrive at the true state of an idea, object, etc. He also states that what is beneficial for one group might not necessarily be advantageous for another. Dissoi Logoi considers that rhetoric can be situational. In regards to Gorgias, the persuasive argument is dependent upon what seems logical according to the situation at any given time. Good and bad are relative to context, point of view, time, place, etc. Edward Schiappa further simplified the concept of dissoi logoi by putting the concept into the following form: \\"X can be Y and not-Y.\\" What cannot be denied is the confounding nature with which the Dissoi Logoi conveys its message. For instance, in the very first chapter, the author states \\"some say that what is good and what is bad are two different things, others that they are the same thing..I myself side with the latter group\\", yet by the end of this chapter, it has changed \\"I am trying rather to point out that it is not the same thing which is bad and good, but that each is different from the otherRobinson, T.M. \\"Contrasting Arguments\\" pp.99-105. Arno Press. 1979 Rosamond Sprague argues that good and bad cannot be the same and are, in fact, different from each other. He exemplifies this by looking at the concept of war. If good and bad were the same, then by doing a great deal of harm, you would also be doing them the greatest goods. On the true purpose of the Dissoi Logoi one scholar writes \\"it could be a serious, and hence disappointingly bad treatise; a heavy-handed spoof of such (Sophist) works; a workbook for dialecticians...It is almost impossible to say anything about the Dissoi Logoi that goes beyond mere conjecture.\\" Bailey, D.T.J. 2008. \\"Excavating the Dissoi Logoi 4\\". Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy: 250' ==Related works== There are many 5th and 4th century BC works that touch upon similar concepts mentioned in the Dissoi Logoi. As previously mentioned, the Dissoi Logoi's attempt to argue and issue from both sides is reminiscent of Plato's Protagoras, which was presumably written after the Dissoi Logoi. It could be that the Dissoi Logoi could have been derived from Protagoras himself, and may have even been an influence on Plato while he was writing his Protagoras.Gera, D.L. Two Thought Experiments in the Dissoi Logoi.The American Journal of Philology121(1): 24 The Dissoi Logoi speak in detail about the acquisition of language in humans, which is ultimately determined to be learned, not inherent (6.12). He comes to this conclusion through a question, \\"What if a Greek child is born in Greece and immediately sent to live in Persia? The answer of course is that the child would speak Persian, not Greek, and therefore language must be learned. A similar debate is waged in Herodotus's Histories 2.2, where an Egyptian king, Psammetichus, attempts to determine the world's first language by raising two newborns completely in lack of language. The children independently begin to speak Phrygian, which is then determined to be the first language of man. Both Herodotus, and the author of the Dissoi Logoi seem to have invested thought into the developments of language Gera, D.L.

Leavitt accepted, turning down an invitation from the First Parish in Concord, Massachusetts. \\"Youthful, brilliant, with a mind trained by keen scientific observation, his message could not have failed to capture the attention of his hearers,\\" wrote Mary Rogers Cabot in her Annals of Brattleboro, 1681-1895\\\\. Among Rev. Leavitt's earliest moves in his new ministry was helping found the Women's Alliance.Annals of Brattleboro, 1681-1895, Vol. I, Mary Rogers Cabot, E.L. Hildreth & Co., Brattleboro, 1921 Leavitt served in Brattleboro until 1897, during which time he delivered sermons with titles like \\"Some Things which Astronomy Teaches about the Universe\\".Vermont Public Documents 1893-1894, The Tuttle Company, Rutland, 1894 In 1897, Leavitt stepped down from his Brattleboro ministry when he was named pastor of First Unitarian Church, then known as All Souls' Church, in Washington, D.C., where he served three years.Records of Columbia Historical Society of Washington, D.C., Vol. 13, Columbia Historical Society, Published by the Society, Washington, 1913 The church had been the worship place of several Presidents, and Leavitt's appointment was watched closely. In 1899 Leavitt delivered a eulogy to Vermont Senator Justin S. Morrill that demonstrated his lean speaking style, beginning with a simple sentence: \\"In moments of deepest emotion we are instinctively silent.\\"Memorial Addresses on the Life and Character of Justin S. Morrill (late a Senator from Vermont), Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1899 Leavitt's tenure at All Souls' began auspiciously. Nearly 1,000 worshippers regularly filled the church for two Sunday services, and the church found itself compelled to rent additional pews for the overflow.The Unitarian, Vol. XII, Jabez Thomas Sunderland, Brooke Herford, Frederick B. Mott, George H. Ellis, Boston, 1897 Word of Leavitt's intellectual ministry and powerful speaking style spread. ==San Francisco ministry== Aftermath, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake In 1900 Leavitt was named minister of San Francisco's First Unitarian Church, succeeding the ill Rev. Dr. Horatio Stebbins. Minister Thomas Starr King, one of San Francisco's most beloved figures (commemorated in a large statue in Golden Gate Park) had served as the First Church's minister during the Civil War. Rev. Leavitt was named to the post on the church's fiftieth anniversary in 1900, and he held the pastorate for 13 eventful years. From the beginning, Rev. Leavitt sent a message of change. \\"The struggles of the coming century will be largely social,\\" the pastor wrote on his acceptance of his new West Coast ministry. \\"Personal salvation will give way to social salvation.‚Äù In 1903, the activist Rev. Leavitt took the podium to address the convention of the California State Suffrage Association at Golden Gate Hall.History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. VI, National American Woman Suffrage Association, J.J. Little & Ives Company, N.Y., 1922 By early 1906 Leavitt felt so confident of his mission that he wrote glowingly of the church's reinvigorated finances and activist social program. \\"Never in the history of this Coast has our situation been as promising as it is today,\\" Leavitt wrote his parishioners. Three months later everything changed. On April 18, 1906, the San Francisco earthquake rent the city, setting buildings alight, killing scores, devastating Leavitt's ministry, and despoiling his church. The tremors shook the church's bell from its tower, sending it careening through the roof, interrupting worship services for a considerable period. The earthquake also destroyed the homes of many communicants, as well as driving others from the devastated city. During the following years, Leavitt's pastoral presence was evident across the devastated Bay Area. In 1907, Leavitt was named one of the University preachers at the Memorial Church at the Leland Stanford Junior University in Palo Alto.Annual Register, Leland Stanford Junior University Palo Alto, Stanford University, Published by the University, 1908 (Leavitt subsequently served as a special preacher at the university, delivering the sermon on alternate Sundays during the academic year, and he gave several baccalaureate sermons at Stanford graduation services during his tenure at First Unitarian Church).As a result of his close work with Stanford University, Rev. Leavitt and Mrs. Leland Stanford became good friends, and he is mentioned frequently in her memoirs. In the years following the earthquake Leavitt became involved in a wide variety of charities, including the San Francisco Foundling Asylum, the San Francisco Relief and Red Cross Funds, and San Francisco Polytechnic. The Unitarian minister sat on the committee overseeing the city's hospitals, was a member of the Council of Associated Charities, and served on the advisory committee of the Independent League of Republican Clubs. Letter from Rev. Bradford Leavitt to conservationist John Muir, inviting Muir to celebrations at First Unitarian Church for centennial of Ralph Waldo Emerson's birth. 1903 The San Francisco earthquake, Leavitt wrote his Harvard classmates, was the watershed event of his life: \\"I have been through the earthquake and fire and taken my part in the rehabilitation work, and now feel a bit the worse for wear, but wouldn't have missed it for an ordinary year or two of life.\\"Secretary's Report, Harvard College Class of 1890, Harvard College, Printed for the Use of the Class, Boston, 1909 During the same period Leavitt continued speaking out on issues of the day. He spoke to a teachers' associations, telling them the new century's most profound event was the study of evolution. \\"The ministerial world now recognizes the latter (evolution),\\" Leavitt told the assembled history teachers, \\"and can now see evolution in the parable of the seed and its growth and in the work of Saint Paul.\\" (Leavitt's speech on the subject preceded the famous Scopes Monkey Trial by more than a decade.)The Social Studies, American Historical Association, National Board for Historical Service, National Council for the Social Sciences, McKinley Publishing Co., 1911 In the years following the San Francisco earthquake, Rev. Leavitt worked with the city's mayor and civil service on relief work. But, ironically, Leavitt later turned against the Mayor and his lieutenants after his discovery of corruption at the highest levels of San Francisco's City Hall, which Leavitt later helped expose. The city's mayor was convicted in the investigation that followed, and the entire Board of Supervisors resigned in the wake of the scandal. \\"We have dreamed we were living under the government of laws,\\" Leavitt wrote following the attempted assassination of Assistant San Francisco District Attorney Heney, who was investigating corruption Leavitt helped uncover, \\"whereas we were living under the government of newspapers hired by corrupt corporations, and the enemies of civic decency.\\"The System, As Uncovered at the San Francisco Graft Prosecution, Franklin Hichborn, James H. Barry Company, San Francisco, 1915 First Unitarian Universalist Church, San Francisco, Rev. Bradford Leavitt named pastor in 1900 ==Post-ministry== Leavitt left the ministry for business in 1913 and became a successful San Francisco merchant, living at 2511 Octavia Street and at his ranch in Woodside, California, on the peninsula south of the city.Leavitt eventually lived fulltime at his 'Shine Ranch' in Woodside. After leaving the ministry, Leavitt worked for the firm of A.E.S. Thompson & Co. in the commission business at 24 California Street. Near the end of his life, the former minister turned undertaking entrepreneur, helping run the business of undertakers N. Gray & Co., where he became vice president of the mortuary's South San Francisco and Burlingame operations - a job change that engendered considerable controversy.Seventh Report, Harvard College Class of 1890, Seventh Report, 1920, The Rumford Press, Concord, N.H., 1921 But Leavitt was accustomed to controversy: in his career as a businessman, he had worked with inventor R.B. Fageol to create one of America's earliest automotive companies, founded in Oakland, California, a venture that later failed.Leavitt served as a secretary for the Fadgl Flexible System, not related to Fageol Motors, an early manufacturer of buses and trucks and tractors. In his work with R.B. Fageol, Leavitt was associated with the Standard Oil Company of California. The progressive Leavitt remained loyal to his alma mater, serving with the Harvard Club of San Francisco. He was also a member of the Commonwealth Club. Edwin Bradford Leavitt (who later dropped his first name) was married to Grace Wentworth (n√©e Smith) in Boston on May 9, 1892. They had one daughter, Helen. Leavitt's views were best summarized in an address he gave to the graduating class of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of San Francisco on May 19, 1904, at the Alhambra Theater on the cusp of the quake that decimated the city. \\"People might be divided into three classes,\\" Leavitt told the graduates. \\"First, those that never think, but follow some routine because of birth, inheritance, associations, environment and convenience. Second, those who think they think, but are, of necessity, very superficial. And the third class which, (I) am sorry to say, is the smallest numerically, the real thinkers.\\"Pacific Medical Journal, Vol. XLVII, January-December 1904, Published 1904 As a minister, Leavitt had little truck with dogma: he might have been called an ecclesiastical existentialist. \\"If Christianity is not creed but character\\", Leavitt told his barber, \\"not a theory but a life, then it would seem that those who follow the teachings of Christ, with a theory or without one, are entitled to be called Christians.\\"A Sketch of the Life of John M.

Hovannisian, The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times, 244 ==Proposals== The Ottoman plan was to draw the Persians, Kurds, Tatars and Georgians into a holy war against the Allies. In order to carry this project it was necessary to make sure that Armenian (if the Armenians became hostile), their geographical position would not hamper cooperation between these races. If this agreement went forward and the Ottoman Armenians did not support the Russians, they would be offered autonomy. This offer was one step forward from Armenian reform package, which was already established in February 1914. The Tsar promised autonomy for Russian Armenia. The Tsar promised autonomy to six Turkish Armenian vilayets as well as the two Russian-Armenian provinces.Joseph L. Grabill, (1971) Protestant Diplomacy and the Near East: Missionary Influence on American Policy, 1810-1927, page 59, Earlier a Tsarist Minister of Foreign Affairs reportedly had confided Russia's aim: \\"We need Armenia, but without the Armenians.\\" Primarily because of trust in France and Great Britain as associates of Russia, the Armenian National Council of the Russian Empire accepted the Tsar's offer. A representative meeting of Russian Armenians assembled in Tiflis, Caucasus, during August 1914. Tsar asked Armenian's loyalty and support for Russia in the conflict.The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.412 The proposal was agreed upon and nearly 20,000 Armenians responded to the call, of which only 7,000 were given arms.G. Pasdermadjian (Armen Garo), Why Armenia Should be Free: Armenia's Role in the Present War, Boston, Hairenik Pub. Co, 1918, p. 20 == Members == Negotiations in Erzurum were held between Armenian liaisons Arshak Vramian, Rostom (Stepan Zorian), and E. Aknouni (Khatchatour Maloumian), and Ottoman liaisons Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Omer Naji (Omer Naci), and Hilmi Bey, accompanied by an international entourage of peoples from the Caucasus. ==Conclusion== The Armenians were quite willing to remain loyal to their government, but declared their inability to agree to the other proposal, that of inciting their compatriots under Russian rule to insurrection.* The rejection by the Ottoman Armenians of that one condition led to serious consequences for themselves. Learning of a possible conflict with Russian Armenians, the Ottoman government in September 1914 decided that the aliens (Russian Armenians) and Turkish Armenians would be a liability in a war against Russia. This incidentally proved of inestimable benefit to the Allies. For if the whole Armenian nation had gone against Russia, that country might have encountered defeat instead of victories early in the war. The Central Powers could have transferred large armies from the Eastern to the Western Front already in 1915 instead of 1917 with the result of such agreement. It is claimed that the proposal was developed by the German Intelligence Bureau for the East, headquartered in Istanbul. The Intelligence Bureau for the East was established on the eve of World War I dedicated to promoting and sustaining subversive and nationalist agitations in the British Indian Empire and the Persian and Egyptian satellite states. It was involved in early plans for war and the Ottoman Caliph's decision to declare Jihad. The Ottoman Empire dismantled the Armenian reform package on December 16, 1914, just after the first engagement of the Caucasus Campaign during the Bergmann Offensive on November 2, 1914. On the other side, the Tsar visited the Caucasus front on December 30, 1914, telling the head of the Armenian Church that \\"a most brilliant future awaits the Armenians\\".Martin Gilbert, 2004, \\"The First World War,\\" Macmillan p.108Avetoon Pesak Hacobian, 1917, Armenia and the War, p.78 ==See also== *Armenian reform package ==References== Category:1914 in Armenia Category:1914 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1914 conferences ","title":"Armenian congress at Erzurum"},{"id":"20404489","text":"Arthur C.

The major center of festivities and commemoration was the University of Chicago, which hosted a five-day event (November 24 to November 28), organized by anthropologist Sol Tax, that attracted over 2,500 registered participants from across the world. According to historian V. Betty Smocovitis, the Chicago celebration \\"outshone-and arguably may still outshine-all other scientific celebrations in the recent history of science.\\"Smocovitis, p. 278 The celebration took place in the wake of the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s and the emergence, by the mid-1950s, of an organized scientific discipline of evolutionary biology, and was an opportunity for biologists of many stripes to lay claim to the legacy of Darwin. It was also a chance for American biologists, and the American Society for the Study of Evolution, to out-compete parallel British events, and for the University of Chicago to assert its emerging position as an important scientific institution.Smocovitis, pp. 274-282 ==Planning== Planning for the Darwin centennial began in the mid-1950s. In 1955 the Darwin Anniversary Committee, Inc., which included a number of Darwin's descendants as honorary officers, formed to coordinate anniversary events worldwide. Various other organizations, including the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), the American Scientific Affiliation, various biological journals and scientific societies and institutions in many countries, also began planning independent activities and commemorative publications. After the evolutionary synthesis, whose founders sought to make genetics-based evolution by natural selection the central uniting principle of all biology, almost all of the most prominent evolutionists in the world--with the notable exception of Julian Huxley, the public face of evolution in England--were Americans. Early in the planning there was considerable tension between the American-based SSE and the heavily British Darwin Anniversary Committee (which included Huxley). Through the organizational and promotional efforts of Sol Tax, most of the major figures in evolutionary biology ultimately settled on the University of Chicago as the main site for celebration activities. Tax brought together a wide array of interests to support the Chicago events and preempt any major British plans. Although his early efforts to secure the participation of important evolutionists had limited success, plans began coalescing after Tax arranged for Julian Huxley to serve as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago for the fall 1959 semester. He enlisted prominent British naturalists to participate, including Huxley as the honorary chairman of the Darwin Anniversary Committee, Inc. and Darwin's grandson Sir Charles Darwin as a headline speaker, and even attempted to attract Winston Churchill and Elizabeth II to the events. Huxley had planned London-centered events that would have conflicted with others in the United States, but held his London events in 1958 instead. Tax got the support of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley, during a time when the city was also trying to attract other high- profile events such as a World Fair and the Pan-American Games, and coordinated with other city institutions such as the Chicago Zoological Park and the Chicago Natural History Museum to generate as much support and enthusiasm from the city as possible.Smocovitis, pp. 274-293 The title page of On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859 Reuniting anthropology (including the study of human culture) with evolution and the rest of biology was one of Tax's main motivations for his organizing efforts. Into the 1950s, anthropology was notable absent from the new discipline of evolutionary biology, with few anthropology articles in the young journal Evolution and few anthropologists in the Society for the Study of Evolution, to the dismay of the leading evolutionists. However, since the late 1940s the University of Chicago had been pioneering evolutionary approaches to anthropology, and Tax made prominent anthropologists an integral part of the centennial celebration program.Smocovitis, pp. 287-290 ==Chicago events== The program for the Darwin Centennial Celebration centered on a series of panel discussions that featured well-known scholars from a wide range of fields, from astronomers and biochemists to geneticists and systematists to psychologists and physiologists to anthropologists. There were five panels, arranged to go from the origin of life to the evolution of life to man's physical, mental and then sociocultural evolution. The center panels that focused on biological evolution included a number of the \\"architects\\" of the evolutionary synthesis and other important figures in the young discipline of evolutionary biology. The evolutionary biologists had attempted to make biological evolution more prominent in the program, feeling that the origin of life research of biochemists and astronomers was too speculative while social science evolutionary research was in its infancy (with much of the anthropology community still opposed to evolutionism). As it was they tried to set the tone for the other panels, presenting the core of evolution as natural selection acting on random genetic variation; most of the prominent critics of that view of biological evolution were not invited (with the exception of C. H. Waddington, who criticized the synthesis for failing to account for embryology). Despite the eminence of the panelists and the hopes of Sol Tax, the panels mostly--with the exception of the origin of life panel--presented ideas already published and broke little new ground, in part because they were intended for a popular audience; according to historian V. Betty Smocovitis \\"the discussions and even some of the contributed papers were surprisingly flat\\".Smocovitis, pp. 295-299, quotation from p. 298 In addition to the panels, there was an extensive book exhibit with a wide range of evolutionary literature, as well as an exhibit in the University of Chicago Library on Darwin's published works. Two evolution- related films were screened: The Ladder of Life and Evolutionary Aspects of Social Communication in Animals.Smocovitis, pp. 299-300 Tax also scheduled a dramatic performance. The initial plan was to stage a production of the hit 1955 play about the Scopes Trial, Inherit the Wind (to be directed by Studs Terkel); Tax's next idea was to produce an Oklahoma!-style musical with the theme of progress. Ultimately, Tax and the Darwin Anniversary Committee commissioned business administration professor Robert Ashenhurt and investment broker Robert Pollack to produce a musical reenactment of Darwin's life. The result, Time Will Tell, was performed every night of the Darwin Centennial Celebration to great success.Smocovitis, pp. 305-309 Julian Huxley's speech caused a controversy The high point of the celebration was the Convocation ceremony that took place on Thanksgiving Day, which brought elements of sacred ritual to an otherwise mostly secular celebration. After a procession to Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, Bach organ music and a prayer, Julian Huxley--a proponent of religious humanism--delivered a lecture entitled \\"The Evolutionary Vision\\". In it, he described religion as an \\"organ of evolving man\\" that was no longer necessary in traditional forms; the audience, by and large, reacted strongly and negatively to this \\"secular sermon\\". Following Huxley's lecture, awards were presented to Sir Charles Darwin, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Alfred Kroeber, Hermann Joseph Muller, George Gaylord Simpson, Sewall Wright, and Julian Huxley.Smocovitis, pp. 302-305 ==Media coverage and documentation== In order to get the most out of the Darwin Centennial Celebration beyond the actual event, the planning committee worked with Encyclop√¶dia Britannica to produce a documentary. The resulting 28.5 minute film was completed by 1960, when John T. Scopes was brought in to speak at its premier. The celebration was also covered widely in newspapers and radio by a 27-member press corps. Huxley's address on religion and evolutionary humanism generated a particularly large amount of coverage (mostly negative). Chicago CBS affiliate WBBM-TV aired a discussion, hosted by Irving Kupcinet, that featured Sir Charles Darwin, Sir Julian Huxley, Harlow Shapley, Adlai Stevenson, and Sol Tax. The radio program All Things Considered (among others) devoted several episodes to the event's panel discussions. The papers contributed to the event and transcripts of all the panels were published early in 1960 as Evolution after Darwin, which received favorable reviews.Smocovitis, pp. 309-313 The public response to most aspects of the celebration (with the exception of Huxley's controversial speech) was very positive. However, the event also reinvigorated American creationism: Henry M. Morris, a coauthor of the influential 1961 young earth creationism book The Genesis Flood, would later credit the Darwin Centennial Celebration for making clear the threat posed by evolutionary science.Smocovitis, pp. 313-316 The organizers tried but failed to enlist significant participation by historians of science, who (according to one organizer) seemed \\"baffled by the task of getting ten authors to write something new in this field.\\" Many historians of evolution were also participating in a competing historical event at Johns Hopkins University. Ironically, the historical interest generated by the centennial may have contributed to the subsequent development of the so-called Darwin Industry.Smocovitis, pp. 317-319, quotation from p. 318 ==See also== * Darwin Day * Evolution Sunday ==NotesReferences== *Smocovitis, Vassiliki Betty. \\"The 1959 Darwin Centennial Celebration in America.\\" Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 14, Commemorative Practices in Science: Historical Perspectives on the Politics of Collective Memory (1999), pp. 274‚Äì323. ==External links== * Guide to the Darwin Centennial Celebration Records - University of Chicago Library, Archives and Manuscripts *Darwin Centennial photographs - University of Chicago Library, Archival Photographic Files Category:History of evolutionary biology Category:Charles Darwin celebrations Category:1959 in science Category:University of Chicago ","title":"Darwin Centennial Celebration (1959)"},{"id":"20404715","text":"Bhakt Singh may refer to: * Bakht Singh (Maharaja) (1706‚Äì1752), ruler of present-day Rajasthan, India * Guru Bhakt Singh 'Bhakt' (1893‚Äì1983), Indian poet and dramatist ","title":"Bhakt Singh"},{"id":"20404720","text":"The following article presents a summary of the 1912 association football season in Paraguay. ==First Division== The Paraguayan first division championship was played for the \\"Copa El Diario\\", a trophy issued by the newspaper of the same name.

Carbon-based fuels are of two main kinds, biofuels and fossil fuels. Whereas biofuels are derived from recent-growth organic matter and are typically harvested, as with logging of forests and cutting of corn, fossil fuels are of prehistoric originPaul Mann, Lisa Gahagan, and Mark B. Gordon, \\"Tectonic setting of the world's giant oil and gas fields,\\" in Michel T. Halbouty (ed.) Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1990-1999, Tulsa, Okla.: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p.50, accessed 22 June 2009. and are extracted from the ground, the principal fossil fuels being oil, coal, and natural gas. From an economic policy perspective, an important distinction between biofuels and fossil fuels is that only the former is sustainable or renewable. Whereas we can continue to obtain energy from biofuels indefinitely in principle, the Earth's reserves of fossil fuels was determined millions of years ago and is therefore fixed as far as our foreseeable future is concerned. The great variability in the ease of extraction of fossil fuels however makes its endgame scenario one of increasing prices over one or more centuries rather than of abrupt exhaustion. From the perspective of climate and ecology, biofuels and fossil fuels have in common that they contribute to the production of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has emerged in recent decades as the fastest-changing greenhouse gas, whose principal impacts are global warming and ocean acidification. However biofuels actively participate in the carbon cycle today by photosynthesizing carbon dioxide, unlike fossil fuels whose participation was long ago, and can therefore in principle bring atmospheric CO2 into an equilibrium not possible with the continued use of fossil fuel. But in practice photosynthesis is a slow process, and the additional fuel produced by artificial methods of accelerating it such as application of fertilizer tends to be offset by the energy consumed by the accelerating processes,Pimentel-Patzek report to a degree currently under active debate. National Biodiesel Board response to Pimentel In contrast the speed of photosynthesis is immaterial for fossil fuels because they had millions of years in which to accumulate. Burning of both fossil fuels and biofuels usually also produces carbon monoxide, which is toxic and can kill a person after mixing with the haemoglobin of the blood, increasing its concentration in the body. Biofuels and fossil fuels may also produce many other air pollutants depending on the contents of the fuel. ==References * The Report of the National Advisory Panel on Sustainable Energy Science and Technology, Chapter 5, Carbon-Based Fuels * \\"The Coming Energy Crisis?\\" - essay by James L.

Walker, 113 U.S. 659 (1885), regards a case where the deeds for several parcels of land were transferred from Flagg, who was in financial difficulty, to Walker in return for paying off Flagg's debts and profits from the sale against a mortgage for other property owned by Flagg.. ==Flagg's financial situation== William F. Flagg, one of the appellants, was the owner, in February 1875, of real estate in and near the City of Bloomington, Illinois, which may be generally described as follows: #A large manufacturing establishment, known as the Empire Machine Works, and about of land upon which it stood. #A tract of land containing about , known as \\"the pasture\\", situated in the northeastern part of the city. #Block No. 1, in Flagg's third addition to the City of Bloomington, containing about , on which stood his residence. This property is designated in the record as the \\"homestead\\". #A large number of lots in the city, most of them vacant, but on about ten of which were tenement houses. #A tract in Fayette County, Illinois, and lands in Pettis County, Missouri. He also owned a large amount of personal property, consisting mainly of the machinery and tools in the Empire Machine Works. At the time, Flagg was in financial difficulty in his business and owed over $50,000. The larger part of this indebtedness bore interest at the rate of ten percent per annum. Much of the real estate was covered by mortgages; his tenement houses were out of repair; he was largely in arrears for taxes and for interest on his indebtedness, and was in broken health. In this condition of his affairs, he sent for the appellee, Samuel Walker, who resided in Massachusetts, and who was the brother of his first wife, and made a statement to him of his financial condition. ==Walker funding== Walker, upon the transfer of the property, paid off all or nearly all of the unsecured debts of Flagg, and furnished Mrs. Flagg with money to pay the taxes which were due and interest due and unpaid on the residue of Flagg's debts, and supplied Flagg with money to take a trip for the improvement of his health. The money so advanced amounted on August 27, 1875, to over $11,000. After these events, on September 25, 1878, the original bill in this case was filed by Mrs. Flagg against Walker, Sibley, Weed, the trustee, and her husband, William F. Flagg. It alleged that since the conveyances made by her husband to Walker in February 1875, the former had by mesne conveyances transferred and conveyed to her \\"all his interest, right, and title in and to said real estate above mentioned,\\" referring to the real estate conveyed by Flagg to Walker, \\"and all personal property appertaining thereto, or that went into the hands of Samuel Walker.\\" The bill set out the transfer to Walker by Flagg and his wife of the real and personal estate of Flagg, and in reference thereto made the following averments: \\"That the said deeds were intended by said William F. Flagg and oratrix to secure the said Samuel Walker for his advances to be made by him, as above set forth, and as a further security for a reasonable compensation to be paid to him for the rendition of such services, and that he might out of the sale of a portion of said property be reimbursed for such advances and compensation. It was also agreed . . . that when the purpose for which such conveyance had been made was fully completed, the said Samuel Walker was to reconvey to William F. Flagg, or to oratrix, as they might elect at least one- half of the property remaining unsold and undisposed of, and should keep for himself and for his compensation a portion of said lands, not exceeding one- half of the residue, after payment of all debts.\\" ==Dispute== The bill also averred \\"that shortly after receiving the said deeds of conveyance Samuel Walker executed a statement in writing in which he set forth and stated to your oratrix the use and purpose, both set forth, upon which the said Samuel Walker had received the said property in trust.\\" The bill charged \\"that said deeds of conveyance made to Samuel Walker, while, in fact warranty deeds,\\" were \\"in equity no more or less than mortgages, made to secure said Samuel Walker for his advances to be made by him, and said advances were to be sufficient in amount to pay all indebtedness of said William F. Flagg to other persons than said Samuel Walker, and that said Samuel Walker was to reimburse himself out of the sales to be made by him. \\" The bill alleged that Walker neglected and refused to furnish money to pay the interest on the debt to Sibley, secured by the trust deed to Weed on \\"the pasture,\\" which was well worth $80,000, and that had it not been for the conveyance thereof by Flagg to Walker, Flagg would have been able to raise money to pay the interest on the debt as it accrued, or could have made a new loan and paid off Sibley's claim in full, but by reason of the conveyance to Walker, he was unable to do so, and that Walker knowingly and willfully permitted Sibley, by Weed, his trustee, to sell the premises at a forced sale for about $10,000, when its real value at the time of the sale, was $80,000. Walker filed his answer alleging that he came to Illinois at the request of Flagg and his wife, and upon examination of Flagg's affairs found that he was deeply in debt; that his real estate was heavily encumbered, and that he owed a large floating debt and was out of funds, and that all of his property was likely to be taken from him if it should be forced to sale, but that, after a full investigation, he became satisfied that Flagg's property, with good management, was worth more than his indebtedness, and that he proposed that Flagg should convey all his property to him, and let him manage his business for him; that Walker agreed that he would take the property without any future right of control, management, or ownership remaining in Flagg, and would pay off the debts of Flagg specified in a list furnished to him by Flagg. This list did not include the debt due to Sibley, and he refused to assume that debt and would not agree to pay it, but promised that he would use the rents and profits of the land toward keeping down the interest on the Sibley debt and the taxes, and if he could sell the property so as to pay the debt, he would do so, or he would convey the same to any parties to whom Flagg might sell. At the time of this case, Walker agreed to pay off all the ascertained indebtedness of Flagg, except the Sibley debt, and as to that he was only to pay so much of it as could be made out of a sale of the lands mortgaged to secure it. Walker did in fact pay off all the other indebtedness of Flagg. The complaint made against him is that he did not furnish money to pay the Sibley debt, or sufficient to keep down the interest, but made default in the payment of interest, and thus allowed the property to be sacrificed at a forced sale. In view of the declaration of trust made by Walker on April 12, 1875, it is clear that the transaction between Flagg and Walker was not a mortgage ==Court ruling== The High Court found no error in the proceedings and decree of the circuit court. But as the time limited by the decree, to-wit, April 1, 1881, for the payment to Walker by W. F. Flagg, or some one of the defendants to the cross-bill, of the said sum of $25,207.18, with interest, has passed, we think the time for such payment should be extended. The appellants, while they were litigating their rights with Walker in this Court, having given an appeal bond, which superseded the decree of the circuit court, were not required to make the payment. The court directed that the decree of the circuit court be so modified as to extend the time for the payment of the sum coming to Walker for the period of six months from the filing of the mandate of this Court in the circuit court, and, as so modified, the decree of the circuit was affirmed. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 ==ReferencesCategory:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:1885 in United States case law Category:Bloomington, Illinois ","title":"Flagg v.

The first St. Andrew's crosses are found on the first Austrian stamp issue from June 1, 1850 printed by the Vienna State Printing Works. They are colored crosses found in place of the last four stamp positions on each sheet as sold to the public.Ing. Edwin M√ºller: \\"Die Postmarken von √ñsterreich\\". Die Postmarke GmbH, Vienna 1927. Pp. 9 et seq. Leaving the last four labels free created a problem; the blank labels could be used by forgers to produce counterfeit stamps. For that reason, it was decided to make them unusable by printing the St. Andrew's cross design. The crosses are the same color as their respective stamps and occur in two different types. They are either colored on a white background or the other way around. They are always found in the last row of the sheet and can either be placed in the center or on the left or the right edge. At the time, the sheet of stamps as printed contained four panes, or counter sheets, each with eight rows and columns with 64 clich√©s per pane. It was considered important that there not be an uneven payment when several sheets were purchased (for instance, by businesses). The extant Austria currency was the Gulden, each worth 60 Kreuzer. For that reason, the idea of leaving the last four fields of a sheet free was considered. For example, when buying seven 6-Kreuzer sheets, the price was 42 Gulden instead of 44 Gulden and 48 Kreuzer. With the introduction of the new currency in 1858 (100 Kreuzer = 1 Gulden), the St. Andrew's cross was no longer needed and its use was discontinued. DDR stamp sheet with St. Andrew's cross printed in the gutters The St. Andrew's crosses were again used for a short time during the 1917 issue of special handling stamps that consisted of 13 rows and eight columns, so that 104 special handling stamps were on a pane. The middle four stamps in the bottom row were replaced by St. Andrew's crosses. The issue and printing of these sheets with St. Andrew's crosses was not originally planned but because of the public disapproval of the triangular predecessor, it was decided to change to horizontal format for this stamp issue. Booklet pane with one St. Andrew's cross St. Andrew's crosses are very popular with collectors today. However, few St. Andrew's crosses have survived from the first issue still attached to an adjacent stamp. They were hardly noticed at that time and nearly always torn away, or cut off. Some St. Andrew's cross labels were used to seal letters because they were gummed, so there are still several individual pieces or strips of four extant. Because philately was more widespread at that time many more St. Andrew's crosses exist from the 1916 issue. ==Censor labels== In the Imperial postal censor station in Bermuda St. Andrew's crosses were usually applied in crayon, red, blue or black, to censor resealing labels or tapes used to seal mail being referred to a DAC, deputy assistant censor, or to another department for evaluation. Some of the crosses were applied after the censor labels had been stuck to the cover due to the cross only showing on the front of the label. These, St. Andrew's cross censor labels are also recorded on Prize court mail that was detained in Bermuda and released or sold after the war, in late 1945 and 1946.Torrance & Morenweiser (1991), p. 37 An Imperial censor label, P.C.90, with the censor identity number 1000, occurs with the words \\"School use ONLY\\" at the top of a censor label that was used for training purposes.

The purpose of the clause is twofold: first, to protect the separation of powers philosophy (upon which the federal frame of government is built); and second, to prevent Congress from conspiring to create offices or increase federal officials' salaries with the expectation that members of Congress would later be appointed to these posts. ==TextOrigins== The Framers of the Constitution understood this clause primarily as an anti- corruption device. Painfully familiar with the system of \\"royal influence\\", whereby the English kings had \\"purchased\\" the loyalty of Members of Parliament with appointment to lucrative offices, the framers sought to limit the corrupting effect of patronage and plural office holding in the new Republic. Drawing on examples provided by the bans on plural office holding contained in contemporaneous state constitutions, and in the Articles of Confederation, the Framers crafted a ban on dual office holding, which Alexander Hamilton described in The Federalist No. 76 as \\"an important guard against the danger of executive influence upon the legislative body.\\" Robert Yates proposed to the 1787 Constitutional Convention a ban on Members of Congress from \\"any office established by a particular State, or under the authority of the U. States ... during the term of service, and under the national Government for the space of one year after its expiration.\\" Luther Martin objected to the strictness of Yates' proposal, believing that it would have operated to prevent members of Congress from being appointed to offices in either the federal government and the governments of their respective home states for the period which they were elected to serve. All the delegates in Philadelphia agreed that no Member of Congress should serve in an appointive position while he was sitting, but Nathaniel Gorham, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton wanted no bar at all, once a person was no longer in Congress. Hamilton argued that since passion drives all men, the executive should be able to satisfy the desires of the better qualified men by inducing them to serve in appointive offices. James Madison proposed a compromise solution: \\"that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature.\\" After much debate, Madison's proposal prevailed, but without the prohibition from holding state office (the state might need the Member's services) and the one-year bar after leaving office (it was not long enough to be of any significant effect). They also limited the bar to \\"civil\\" offices so that the military could have the service of all when the country was in danger. ==Political and legal history== The Ineligibility Clause has resulted in some conflicts over potential appointments of Representatives and Senators to various Cabinet posts and other federal government offices. Among the earliest questions to be addressed under the clause was whether a person serving as a United States Attorney could continue to serve in that capacity after being elected to a seat in Congress. In 1816, Samuel Herrick was elected to the 15th United States Congress while still serving as U.S. Attorney for the District of Ohio. He was not allowed to take his seat until the House of Representatives had determined whether his service as a U.S. Attorney created a conflict under the clause. Finally, in December 1817, the United States House Committee on Elections determined that there was no conflict, because even though Herrick had been elected to Congress, he had not taken the Congressional oath of office while he was still serving as a U.S. Attorney.O'Connor, John. \\"The Emoluments Clause: An Anti-Federalist Intruder in a Federalist Constitution\\", 24 Hofstra L.

Unlike the incompatibility lawsBorn in canonical law (see Right of Option), it was applied also in temporal law: see Incompatibilitas in Poland. of many European countries (and in the European Union institutions),Delaying tactics could frustrate the successful enforcement of the incompatibility between national parliamentary mandate and Italian MEP: the clause does not bar simultaneous service as a federal judge and member of the executive branch. The constitutionality of the practice is suggested not only by the lack of a textual prohibition, but by a few prominent examples of such service in the early days of the Republic, such the simultaneous service of Chief Justices John Marshall, John Jay, and Oliver Ellsworth in judicial and executive posts. Nonetheless, examples of joint service in the executive and the judiciary have been a rarity in American history, and a strong tradition has developed disfavoring the practice. The clause has been interpreted as barring the appointment of a member of Congress to a post in another branch of government only if the pay raise occurred during a single term for which the member had been elected. In other words, the disability does not carry over to subsequent terms in office. This is in line with the view expressed about the clause by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States.Story, Joseph. Commentaries on the Constitution, Vol. 2: ¬ß¬ß 864--69. It is not clear if a member of Congress could hold a reserve commission in the armed forces (which fall under the Executive Branch), as the only case was never ruled upon due to lack of legal standing. This particular issue came before United States Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty when President Warren G. Harding sought to appoint Senator William S. Kenyon to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. During Senator Kenyon's term (which was set to expire on March 4, 1919), Congress increased judicial salaries. Kenyon was then reelected in 1918 for another term, which was to begin immediately upon the expiration of his previous term of office. Harding nominated Kenyon to the court in 1922. When he requested Daugherty's formal opinion on Kenyon's eligibility, Daugherty (relying in part upon Story's Commentaries) explained that Kenyon would have been disqualified only until the end of his term during which salaries were actually raised, not for the next following term for which he had been elected. The converse of this position, however, is that the disability continues for the term for which the Senator or Congressman was elected, rather than for the actual length of time in office, so that mere resignation from the Congress does not remedy the disability created by the clause. This is the view that Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster took in advising President Chester A. Arthur that former Iowa governor and U.S. Senator Samuel J. Kirkwood was ineligible for appointment to the U.S. Tariff Commission, even though Kirkwood had already resigned his Senate seat to become Secretary of the Interior. Brewster reasoned that because the Tariff Commission had been created in 1882, and Kirkwood's Senate term would have expired in 1883 if he had not first resigned, that Kirkwood was ineligible for the office. The clause was at issue in 1937, when fifty-one-year-old sitting United States Senator from Alabama Hugo Black was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Congress had recently increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. The emolument was one that Black would not derive benefit from for some 19 years and only if he survived that long. Furthermore, Time points out that the Retirement Act for which Black had voted merely guaranteed justices' pensions against reduction. When Black's appointment was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court, the court declined to hear the case, holding in Ex parte Levitt that the petitioner lacked standing.See Ex parte Albert Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937) Perhaps the most widely known conflict involving this clause concerned the appointment of Senator William B. Saxbe of Ohio to the post of United States Attorney General by then-President Richard Nixon, in the aftermath of the Saturday Night Massacre. The salary of the Attorney General had been increased in 1969, in the first year of the Senate term that Saxbe was still serving in 1973. Nixon's solution was to have Congress reduce the Attorney General's salary to the value it had before Saxbe took office. This maneuver, known in legal and political circles as the Saxbe fix, has been used a number of times since, though its legality is not universally agreed-upon. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel is often called upon by the president to determine whether an appointment is in violation of the clause. This was the necessary when President Bill Clinton appointed Bill Richardson as United States Ambassador to the United Nations and appointed William Cohen as Secretary of Defense, and when George W. Bush appointed Tony P. Hall Ambassador to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. In none of these cases, however, was the appointee chosen by the president prohibited from taking office. In late 2008, the question was raised whether the clause would apply to the appointment of Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Subsequently, Congress reset the pay for the position to its level prior to Senator Clinton's election to the Senate.\\"Secretary of state salary cut for Clinton\\", Associated Press via NBC News (December 11, 2008). The ineligibility clause could also have been considered relevant to Hillary Clinton's run for the Senate in 2000. Although the First Lady of the United States receives no salary, she holds spending and hiring authority concerning areas under her White House East Wing and residence purview. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, often served as White House hostess or de facto acting First Lady during her mother's senatorial campaign, as Hillary Clinton needed to set aside her First Lady duties as she ran for the Senate, in part because she needed to move to the state of New York to establish residency there. She resumed her duties as First Lady when she won the Senate race. For the fortnight between Hillary Clinton taking office as a Senator (January 3, 2001) and the expiration of Bill Clinton's presidency (January 20, 2001), Hillary Clinton remained First Lady. There has been very little academic commentary on the clause and virtually no judicial explication of it. The only two lawsuits brought challenging appointments under the clause have been dismissed on grounds of lack of standing. ==References *Annotations on the Clause from Justia.com *Resources on the Ineligibility Clause, from The Founder's Constitution project at the University of Chicago Category:Clauses of the United States Constitution Category:Conflict of interest mitigation ","title":"Ineligibility Clause"},{"id":"20405085","text":"Club Nacional de Regatas El Mbigu√° (most commonly known as \\"Club Mbigu√°\\") is a multisport club based in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.

The program was announced on November 25, 2008 and was to support the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Under TALF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (NY Fed) authorized up to $200 billion of loans on a non-recourse basis to holders of certain AAA- rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated consumer and small business loans. (However, only approximately $70 billion was ever lent, and only approximately $50 billion at any one time.Reflections on the TALF and the Federal Reserve's Role as Liquidity Provider, Brian Sack, June 9 2010) As TALF money did not originate from the U.S. Treasury, the program did not require congressional approval to disburse funds, but an act of Congress forced the Fed to reveal how it lent the money. == Purpose == The Fed explained the reasoning behind the TALF as follows: == Structure and terms == According to the plan, the NY Fed would spend up to $200 billion in loans to spur the market in securities backed by lending to small business and consumers.

The NY Fed would take the securities as collateral for more loans the issuers would ostensibly make. To manage the TALF loans, the NY Fed was to create a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) that would buy the assets securing the TALF loans. The U.S. Treasury's Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 would finance the first $20 billion of asset purchases by buying debt in the SPV.

Michael Schlachter, the managing director of an investment consulting firm in Santa Monica, California called it \\"absolutely ridiculous\\" that banks may profit from speculating on toxic debt, when their pursuit of it caused the financial crisis. Schlachter said, ‚ÄúSome of them created this mess, and they are making a killing undoing it.‚Äù The prices for some of the securities that PPIP was to buy almost doubled between March 2009 and the end of the year, a rally that was in part caused by traders jumping in before the PPIP funds were available, according to one trader.

In one example highlighted by Rolling Stone, nine loans were made to Waterfall TALF Opportunity, an offshore company formed in June 2009. Two of the chief investors of Waterfall are Christy Mack and Susan Karches, who have little or no previous business experience. Mack is married to John Mack, former chairman of Morgan Stanley and Karches is the widow of Peter Karches, once the president of Morgan Stanley's investment banking division and good friends of the Macks. Waterfall was capitalized with $14.87 million, presumably from Mack and Karches. Two months after the company was established, the Fed gave them low-interest TALF loans totaling $220 million. The way TALF loans were set up, 100 percent of any profit is retained by the borrower, but the Fed and the Treasury absorb any losses. The Fed and the Treasury are funded by taxpayers. Waterfall used the $220 million TALF loans to buy securities, including a large pool of commercial mortgages managed by Credit Suisse, a company once headed by Mack's husband. As of autumn 2010, about 68 percent, some $150 million, had not yet been paid back. The Fed refuses to provide any information on how it priced individual securities bought with TALF funds. It only provides lump sums of what was spent on a block of securities, but without indication of how many units were bought, making analysis of TALF impossible. The public has no way of knowing how much Waterfall earned on the securities it bought, although the Fed values them at $253.6 million. Securities lawyer and whistleblower Gary J. Aguirre says the pricing information is essential to validating the Fed's role in TALF, to judge how the taxpayers' funds were used. Senator Chuck Grassley has requested detailed information from Waterfall about its transactions and Sanders has asked Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke for more detailed information on loans made to Waterfall, former Miami Dolphins owner H.

Dalemark is a region by the sea divided into South Dalemark and North Dalemark, consisting of 15 earldoms (formerly called marks): North Dalemark ‚Äì 7 earldoms *Hannart *Gardale *Loviath *Alberath *Dropwater *Kinnarth *North Dales South Dalemark - 8 earldoms *Dermath *Holand *Waywold *Canderack *Andmark *Carrowmark *Fenmark *South Dales In addition to the 15 earldoms, Dalemark includes the so-called King's Lands (the Holy Islands, the Marshes, and the Shield of Oreth), although there has been no king in Dalemark for a long time. The earls ruling South Dalemark are presented as much more tyrannical and cruel than the North Dalemark earls, who are described as being more liberal and with greater respect for human freedoms. As a result, there is constant tension between the North and the South, which often erupts in open war or rebellion. The Great Uprising was a countrywide revolution which led to the restoration of monarchy with Amil the Great ascending to the throne of united Dalemark. The Great Uprising took place about a year after the main events described in Drowned Ammet, the second book of the Dalemark Quartet.

For the band's debut album, Snarski utilised the services of Amanda Pearson (vocals, percussion), Barry Turnbull (bass) and Mark Dawson (drums). The album, Del Musical Del Mismo Nombre was released in August 1989 on the Waterfront label (available only on vinyl) to critical acclaim, although it was re-released on CD in 1993.Citadel Records - Del Musical Del Mismo Nombre The main influence on the album was songwriter Snarski's trip to Spain, thus the title which when translated means \\"From the Musical of the Same Name\\". The band recorded the album in four days on a budget of $1000. The lush romanticism of the songs had critics searching for superlatives. Writing in Rolling Stone, reviewer Jon Casimir called the album one of the minor masterpieces of 1989. As Casimir put it, the band took inspiration for its 'self-styled urban Romantic Cabaret' from German writers such as Brecht and Weill, as well as Tom Waits. To promote the record they toured nationally twice, playing successful shows in Sydney and Melbourne. Rather than capitalise on such acclaim however, Snarski chose to take a break, spending two years travelling in Spain and the USA. Snarski revived The Jackson Code in 1992 and recorded a new album, Strange Cargo. Snarski was joined in the recording studio by Pearson, Turnbull and Dawson, together with string, brass and 'hand-clap' sections. Strange Cargo was released on the Citadel label in August 1992. 1993 also saw the band sign to RooArt and produce one of that years (sic) finest, Draggin' The River. The album was released in December 1993. The band's last studio album was The Things You Need, which was released in September 1995. After touring with American crime writer James Ellroy in 1996, Snarski left Australia for Europe finally settling in Madrid. > 'There was this one afternoon where I'd dropped everyone off and I was > carting this amp up the stairs of - what's that theatre we played in St > Kilda? I just put it down and decided, I've had enough of this.' The Jackson Code's drummer Mark Dawson plays with the Blackeyed Susans (he also worked with Ed Kuepper). Kenny Davis Jr and Kathryn Wemyss also played, albeit briefly, with the Blackeyed Susans. Wemyss later performing with Midnight Oil at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics in 2000, since then she has formed her own band called Wemo. Davis went on to join Decoder Ring. Barry Turnbull and Mandy Pearson went on to form their own band, Love Me.Love Me website The Jackson Code's retrospective album of 1998, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told, a two disc compilation album (the first disc consists of tracks from the four studio albums and the second disc is full of rarities) was released in September 1998.Music Australia In 2003 Del Musical Del Mismo Nombre was re-issued on a CD format by Citadel Records.

On 16 February General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle, the commander of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, left L·∫°ng S∆°n with Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to relieve the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang. Before his departure, he ordered General Oscar de N√©grier, who would remain at L·∫°ng S∆°n with the 2nd Brigade, to press on towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, De N√©grier advanced to attack the Guangxi Army at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. == French forces at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng == De N√©grier's 2nd Brigade numbered just under 2,900 men in February 1885. The brigade's order of battle was as follows: *3rd Marching Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger) **23rd Line Infantry Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Godart) **111th Line Infantry Battalion (chef de bataillon Faure) **143rd Line Infantry Battalion (chef de bataillon Farret) *4th Marching Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier) **2nd Foreign Legion Battalion (chef de bataillon Diguet) **3rd Foreign Legion Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Schoeffer) **2nd African Light Infantry Battalion (chef de bataillon Servi√®re) *1st Battalion, 1st Tonkinese Rifle Regiment (chef de bataillon Jorna de Lacale) *3 artillery batteries (Captains Roperh, de Saxc√© and Martin).Lecomte, 332 De N√©grier advanced on ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng with Herbinger's three line battalions, the two Foreign Legion battalions, a company of Tonkinese riflemen and Roperh and de Saxc√©'s batteries. Servi√®re's 2nd African Battalion was left to guard L·∫°ng S∆°n and the brigade's supply line back to Chu. Martin's battery also remained at L·∫°ng S∆°n.Lecomte, 337‚Äì9 == Chinese positions == The Chinese had established an extremely strong position, centred on a 300-metre high limestone plateau which rose just to the west of the Mandarin Road and ran due north from ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng to the Gate of China and beyond into China itself. This massif overlooked ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng and the approaches to the Gate of China, and presented a sheer cliff face towards the southeast. It could only be climbed on its western side, and the Chinese had established a sheltered artillery position on its summit, just behind ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, commanding the steep western slopes that an attacker would have to scale. A number of infantry camps and several other artillery emplacements had been built on the summit. The left of the Chinese position lay along the hills directly to the east of the Mandarin Road, which were covered by the elevated infantry and artillery positions on the limestone massif. These positions were quite secure against a frontal attack as long as the massif itself remained in Chinese hands. To reach a position from which they could assault the limestone massif the French would first have to take ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, which lay directly in their way. The Chinese had deployed their right wing in and around ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. The small low-lying town was the weakest point in the Chinese position, but the Chinese had done what they could to strengthen it by building three strong forts on the hills to its west, overlooking the villages of Dong Tien and Pho Bu and the That Ke valley. These strongpoints, the ‚ÄòWestern Forts‚Äô, were linked by a defensive line which contained ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng itself. The Chinese could also rely on the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng stream, a fast-flowing arroyo which ran across the entire front of their line, to act as a moat for their defences and slow down any French attack.Lecomte, 341‚Äì2 == The battle of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, 23 February 1885 == Map of the battle of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, 23 February 1885 The French attack column left L·∫°ng S∆°n at 8 a.m. on 23 February and followed the Mandarin Road towards ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. The road threaded its way along the defiles separating the steep mountains, passing through a number of small, abandoned villages. To guard against a possible Chinese surprise attack, chef de bataillon Tonnot led the way with an unusually strong advance guard‚ÄîDiguet's Legion battalion, de Saxc√©'s battery, the Tonkinese skirmishers and the cavalry. Herbinger followed on behind with the rest of the infantry and Roperh's battery. The 143rd Battalion was split into individual companies for the day's operations. One company marched with the main body, a second formed the rearguard, and the remaining two were detached as escorts for the two artillery batteries.Lecomte, 339 At 9.30 a.m. the French vanguard entered the village of Tham Lon and discovered some unoccupied Chinese forts above the nearby hamlet of Ban Vinh. Shortly afterwards it was engaged by a group of Chinese skirmishers, who began firing to warn their comrades of the French approach. Their fire was not dangerous and the French continued to press on, looking for ground where they could deploy into a line of battle. Tonnot deployed a section of de Saxc√©'s battery to give covering fire if necessary, but the Chinese fell back and occupied a rise at a right angle to the road. They were joined by other troops, and began to fire at the head of the French column. The French vanguard now began to deploy into the hills on both sides of the Mandarin Road to face the Chinese skirmishers. De N√©grier, attracted by the sound of the firing, joined Tonnot at the head of the French column. A kilometre to the north of Ban Vinh there was a tall hill which looked as though it would offer a good view of the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng valley, where the Chinese were presumably entrenched. This seemed to be the best position available for the French artillery, and de N√©grier sent forward B√©rard's Legion company to secure it. A party of Chinese skirmishers was occupying the hill, but the legionnaires drove them from it with little difficulty. De N√©grier sent a galloper back to the column's main body with orders for Roperh to deploy his battery on the summit of the hill, now christened by the French 'B√©rard Mound'. While Roperh struggled to get his guns up to the summit of B√©rard Mound the brigade's vanguard fanned out on both sides of the Mandarin Road. Captain Geil's Tonkinese riflemen deployed just to the right of the road, linking up with B√©rard's company, while the other three companies of Diguet's battalion deployed to the left.Lecomte, 340 === Chinese spoiling attack === Tonnot's vanguard had won enough space for the brigade's main body to close up and deploy in its turn. De N√©grier sent half of his troops to its left and the other half to its right. Diguet's legionnaires and Geil's Tonkinese now found themselves holding the centre of the French line. De N√©grier had already decided to throw his right wing forward, in order to secure B√©rard Mound for his artillery, and he now decided to refuse his left wing, deploying the brigade in a diagonal line of three mutually-supporting echelons astride the Mandarin Road. But this deployment, in hilly terrain, was a necessarily slow business, and at around midday the Chinese attempted to envelop both French flanks, perhaps hoping to catch them unprepared.Lecomte, 342‚Äì3 The Chinese attack on the French left, where de N√©grier had refused his line, had little chance of success. The French left wing was held by the 23rd Line Battalion, which was occupying a hill to the southwest of the Mandarin Road behind and to the left of Diguet's legionnaires. The attackers, who issued in large numbers from the Western Forts, attempted to advance up the valley towards Ban Vinh to engage the 23rd Battalion. They had more than two kilometres to march, and before they had covered half this distance they came under fire from a section of French artillery and the three Legion companies deployed to the left of the Mandarin Road. It became clear that the attack was not going to succeed, and the Chinese fell back. The 23rd Battalion did not have to fire a shot in this action, and the Chinese made no further attempts to move against the French left.Lecomte, 343 By contrast, the Chinese attack on the right against B√©rard Mound, occupied by Roperh's battery and its escorts and B√©rard's Legion company, was pressed home vigorously. The Chinese infantry were in considerable strength, and on this occasion were adequately supported by their artillery, which began to engage Roperh's battery from its positions on the cliffs behind ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. The enemy gunners soon found the range and, uniquely during the Sino-French War, the French came under well-aimed artillery fire. Disconcerted by the speed and accuracy of the Chinese fire, Roperh's battery had to change position. De N√©grier sent Commandant Schoeffer to B√©rard Mound to reinforce its defenders with Lascombes and Gaucheron's companies from his own Legion battalion. Lascombes and B√©rard then led their men in a counterattack against a hill overlooking the French position. B√©rard was shot in the chest and seriously wounded during this counterattack, but Lieutenant de F√©raudy immediately assumed command of his company and drove home the French charge. The Chinese fell back in disorder.Lecomte, 343‚Äì4 === French attack on the Western Forts === The French had defeated both Chinese flanking attacks. They could now consider taking the offensive themselves. De N√©grier's plan was a simple and logical three-step operation. To win the battle, the French had to throw the Chinese off the limestone massif. To attack this position, they had first to take ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. To assault ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng without suffering crippling casualties, they had to weaken its defences by reducing the Western Forts. The first step was therefore to capture the Western Forts. De N√©grier prepared the attack on the Western Forts with a lengthy artillery bombardment of the Chinese positions. De Saxc√© and Jourdy's batteries first engaged the Chinese guns in their emplacements on the limestone massif, and by 1 p.m. had completely silenced them. The French batteries then turned their attention to the Chinese positions on the hills to the east of the Mandarin Road that ran back to the Chinese frontier. So far the French infantry on the right of de N√©grier's line had shown no signs of advancing, and the Chinese defenders saw no reason to hold their ground under artillery fire. Unable to reply to the French guns, they evacuated their trenches on the forward slopes and fell back to more sheltered positions on the reverse slopes. Finally, the French guns swept the Chinese positions around the Western Forts. Just before 3 p.m., when he judged that the Chinese were sufficiently demoralised, de N√©grier ordered Herbinger to capture the Western Forts with the 111th Line Battalion and the five closest companies of Diguet and Schoeffer's Legion battalions. The attack would be screened by Geil's Tonkinese. The Chinese did not attempt to hold the forts in the face of the French advance. Their right wing battalions abandoned their positions and began to retreat along the path to That Ke. Herbinger ordered Diguet's men to pursue the retreating Chinese for some distance and set up a blocking position astride the path. He then reorganised the rest of his troops for the next step in de N√©grier's programme, the assault on ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. === Capture of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng by 111th Battalion === Most of the houses in the southern part of the town had been set alight by the French artillery bombardment, and the position was now held only by small groups of Chinese skirmishers. Herbinger decided that the main assault on the town would be made by the 111th Battalion, screened by the Tonkinese and with Brunet and Michel's companies of Schoeffer's Legion battalion in support. The 111th had to advance across a kilometre of open ground, under fire from both the Chinese on the summit of the limestone massif and from a group of Chinese skirmishers in ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng itself. The French conscripts moved forward at a brisk trot and eventually reached the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng stream, 200 metres from the outskirts of the town. Here they hesitated. Men began to fall to the enemy's fire. The company officers jumped into the stream to set an example, and waded through waist-high water to the other side. Once they clambered onto dry land the soldiers had only one thought: to reach the shelter of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng and escape from the plunging fire from the limestone massif. In complete disorder, running at full tilt to close the distance as quickly as possible, the young soldiers of the 111th Battalion charged wildly into the blazing town. The astonished company officers raced to place themselves at the front of this impromptu charge, waving their swords above their heads to spur on their men to yet greater efforts. The speed and fury of this improvised attack took the Chinese skirmishers completely by surprise. They tried to evacuate ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng but were not fast enough. The soldiers of the 111th trapped laggards in the streets or inside houses, and clubbed or bayoneted them to death. The 111th Battalion then reformed inside ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, where it was in reasonable cover from the Chinese on the limestone massif.Lecomte, 345 === French attack on the limestone massif === View of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng and the limestone massif to its north, October 1885 The 23rd Battalion, which had seen little of the battle so far, came up from its position on the French left wing to add its weight to the attack. Herbinger then led both line battalions forward up the slopes to the west of the massif. Schoeffer's two Legion companies followed behind, still in support. Geil's Tonkinese had charged with the 111th into ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, and Herbinger ordered them to secure ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng while the French attacked the key point in the Chinese line.Lecomte, 346 Once the 111th Battalion moved out of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, it again came under plunging fire from the summit of the massif. Again, men began to fall as the battalion scrambled up the slopes as fast as it could. Faure deployed the battalion's four companies into skirmish order, with three companies up and one in support. The forward company on the right, closest to the Chinese positions, took the heaviest casualties, and 2nd Lieutenant √âmile Portier was mortally wounded as it advanced. Despite its casualties the 111th pressed on up the slopes to the attack. Lieutenant de Colomb captured the foremost Chinese trench with his company, but resistance then stiffened and the entire battalion had to be thrown against the Chinese entrenchments before they were taken. With the Chinese right wing falling back towards That Ke, the French proceeded to throw back the Chinese still holding out on the summit of the limestone massif. The 111th Battalion and the two supporting Legion companies had already reached the summit at its southern tip and now moved along its eastern edge, clearing the enemy from their vantage points above the Mandarin Road. Small parties of Chinese clung to several isolated rocks, but were soon prised out of these positions by the French infantry.Lecomte, 346 === Mopping up operations === 2nd Lieutenant √âmile Portier, mortally wounded at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, 23 February 1885 It only remained to deal with a strong enemy force holding a hill just to the northeast of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, which overlooked the entrance to the valley leading to the Chinese frontier and prevented the French from advancing up the Mandarin Road. Geil led his Tonkinese forward from ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng to pin the Chinese frontally, de Saxc√©'s battery occupied a hill just to the north of Pho Bu from which it could engage them at close range, and Lascombes and de F√©raudy's Legion companies began to work their way around their flank. Realising that their position would soon become untenable, the Chinese retreated before they could be forced from it. With the enemy in full retreat either towards That Ke or back into China, de N√©grier ordered the two foremost companies of Diguet's battalion to remain in position astride the path to That Ke, the 111th Battalion to secure the limestone massif, and the rest of the brigade to close up on the village of Cua Ai and the Gate of China. The first units to reach the Gate of China were Brunet and Michel's companies of Schoeffer's battalion, which had left the 111th Battalion alone on the summit of the limestone massif and climbed back down to the plain. The gate itself was protected by two flanking forts and trenches had also been dug along the slopes of the neighbouring hills, but the Chinese troops occupying these defences had been brought forward during the battle to join their comrades around ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. When their lines broke, the French pursued them so closely that they were unable to rally in these positions. As a result, the legionnaires occupied the Gate of China and pushed on across the frontier into China without meeting any resistance. The rest of the brigade gradually came up to Cua Ai. Lascombes and de F√©raudy's companies, on the hills to the east of the Mandarin Road, made their way down into the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng valley and reached the Gate of China shortly after Schoeffer's men. On the extreme right Schoeffer pulled in Gaucheron's company, which had served as a flankguard for most of the afternoon. Finally, Geil's Tonkinese riflemen and the 23rd Battalion followed the road. By nightfall the bulk of the 2nd Brigade was assembled at the Gate of China.Lecomte, 347 An important factor in the Chinese defeat at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng was the failure of the Chinese commander Pan Dingxin (ÊΩòÈºéÊñ∞) to concentrate his forces to meet the French attack. A sizeable contingent of fresh troops under the command of Feng Zicai (È¶ÆÂ≠êÊâç) was left to cover a border crossing several kilometres to the east of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, and took no part in the battle.Lung Chang, 335 == Casualties == French casualties at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng were light: 9 dead and 46 wounded.Lecomte, 348-9 Chinese casualties were far heavier, and included three Chinese generals. Pan Dingxin and Dong Ligao (Ëë£Â±•È´ò) were wounded (the latter seriously), and Yang Yuke (Ê•äÁéâÁßë) was killed. == The destruction of the Gate of China, 25 February 1885 == After clearing the Chinese from Tonkinese territory the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province. The news that the French were on Chinese soil caused panic in Longzhou (Lung-chou, ÈæçÂ∑û) and other provincial towns close to the Vietnamese border. Many Chinese civilians left their homes and fled down the West River to take refuge from the invaders. On 25 February the French blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the Tonkin‚ÄìGuangxi border at Zhennan Pass. De N√©grier erected a wooden placard on the ruins of the Gate of China, inscribed in Chinese with the words 'It is not stone walls that protect frontiers, but the faithful execution of treaties'. The message was a pointed allusion to the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush in June 1884, in French eyes a treacherous violation by the Chinese of the terms of the Tientsin Accord, signed between France and China on 11 May 1884.Armengaud, 35‚Äì6; Bonifacy, 21; Harmant, 180‚Äì7; Lecomte, 349‚Äì51; Normand, 169‚Äì74 The 2nd Brigade was not strong enough to push on further into China, and de N√©grier returned to L·∫°ng S∆°n with the bulk of the brigade at the end of February. A small French garrison under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger was left at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng to watch the movements of the Guangxi Army.Lecomte, 351‚Äì2 Three weeks later the Chinese attacked the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng garrison, precipitating a series of events that led to the French defeat at the Battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885).Lecomte, 420‚Äì8 ==See also== *Imperialism in Asia *French colonial empire *Jules Ferry ==Notes References == * Armengaud, J.

Licensed to Midwest City, Oklahoma, the station serves the Oklahoma City Metroplex. The station is currently owned by First Choice Broadcasting, Inc. ==History== M. W. Cooper and his Mid West Broadcasting Corporation, also part-owned by Tulsa state senator Gene C. Howard and Gene Stipe, put KRMC on the air in April 1973. A year later, the station changed formats and became one of the smallest-market all-news outlets in the country. A daytime-only outlet on a Mexican clear channel, the station's news service utilized the resources of United Press International. However, all-news was a financial failure losing $8,000 a month, prompting KRMC to change to gospel on October 13, 1975. One of the reasons cited by station management for the change was that an all-news format did not work well on a daytime-only station. Another was a change in operation; while not reflected in the records of the Federal Communications Commission, the Oklahoma City Counseling Center acquired the station in 1975. In the early 1980s, KRMC almost negotiated an agreement with Oscar Rose Junior College by which Rose broadcasting students would have operated the station. However, this did not come to pass. The call letters were changed to the present KTLV on November 12, 1987, as the ownership renamed itself Twelve-Twenty Communications Corporation; the licensee name was changed to First Choice Broadcasting in 1992 as part of an internal reorganization. 1220 kHz in Oklahoma City was almost shut down as part of a 2002 deal with Clear Channel Communications that would have seen KTLV's intellectual unit move to 1340 kHz and Clear Channel move KGYN to Oklahoma City from Guymon, Oklahoma. ==References TLV Category:Gospel radio stations in the United States Category:Midwest City, Oklahoma Category:1973 establishments in Oklahoma Category:Radio stations established in 1973 TLV ","title":"KTLV"},{"id":"20405729","text":"Lisa Maria Singh (born 20 February 1972) is an Australian politician who was a Labor Party member of the Australian Senate for Tasmania from 2011 to 2019. She had previously been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, representing the division of Denison from 2006 to 2010. The granddaughter of an Indo-Fijian member of the Parliament of Fiji, Singh was Australia's first federal parliamentarian of Indo-Fijian ancestry. ==Early life== Singh was born 20 February 1972, in Hobart, Tasmania, to a Fijian-Indian father and an English Australian mother. Her father arrived in Australia as an international student in 1963. She attended St Mary's College and Elizabeth College, before leaving Tasmania to live and work in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. She later returned to Tasmania to study at the University of Tasmania, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Social Geography, and also holds a Master of International Relations from Macquarie University. Singh is the granddaughter of Ram Jati Singh, who was a member of the Fijian Legislative Council (the precursor of the present day Fijian Parliament) in the 1960s. Her uncle, Raman Pratap Singh, is a Fijian politician who is a past President of the National Federation Party and was a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 1999.The Fiji Times - Monday, February 28, 1994 He made an unsuccessful attempt to regain his seat in 2014. In her maiden speech in the Senate, Singh claimed descent from the Rajputs.Senator Singh: First Speech ‚Äì Parliament of Australia. Retrieved 24 October 2014. ==Early career== Following university, Singh worked in public relations and for the Australian Education Union as an industrial organiser. After joining the Australian Labor Party, Singh served on the Tasmanian ALP‚Äôs State Administrative Committee, as President of the New Town branch and as a delegate at state and national conferences. From 1999 to 2001, Singh was an adviser to Senator Sue Mackay. Singh then became the Director of the Tasmanian Working Women's Centre, where she campaigned for paid parental leave and equal pay. She is a member of Emily's List, having served on the National Executive of the organisation in Australia. Singh became Hobart Citizen of the Year in 2004 for her work in the peace movement at the time of the Iraq war, especially in highlighting the plight of women and children in war.Migrants 'pledge allegiance' in Hobart, ABC News, 26 January 2004. Singh has also served as the President of the YWCA Tasmania, the President of the United Nations Association Tasmania and as a member of the Tasmania Women's Council. She was convenor of the Australian Republican Movement from 2004 to 2007, and subsequently managed the Tasmanian Government arts unit, arts@work, before being pre-selected by the Australian Labor Party for a House of Assembly seat. ==Election to Tasmanian Parliament== Singh was elected to the House of Assembly at the March 2006 state election, as one of the five members for the division of electorate of Denison, and gave her inaugural speech on 18 March 2006.Inaugural speech, Parliament of Tasmania. In August 2007, she abstained from voting on a controversial bill supporting Gunns' Bell Bay Pulp Mill, after having failed in an appeal to then-Premier Paul Lennon for a free vote on the matter.Backbencher not to vote on mill, ABC News, 20 August 2007. Singh became a parliamentary secretary in early 2008. On 25 November 2008, then-Premier David Bartlett announced that Singh would enter Cabinet as Minister for Corrections and Consumer Protection, Minister for Workplace Relations, and Minister Assisting the Premier on Climate Change. She was sworn in at a ceremony at Government House on 26 November 2008.Singh quiet on mill after swearing-in, ABC News, 27 November 2008. As minister, Singh introduced legislative reforms in workers compensation, corrections, climate change and asbestos management. Singh was defeated at the March 2010 state election. Following that, she co-founded the Asbestos Free Tasmania Foundation, an advocacy group to highlight the dangers of asbestos and support sufferers of asbestos-related disease, and became its first CEO. ==Election to Australian Parliament== Singh was elected to the Australian Senate in the 2010 federal election, making her the first person of South Asian descent to be elected to the Australian Parliament. She began her term on 1 July 2011. On 18 October 2013, she was promoted to the position of shadow parliamentary secretary to the shadow Attorney-General. On 24 June 2014, the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, promoted her to the position of shadow parliamentary secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Water. In 2014, she was awarded one of India‚Äôs highest civilian awards, the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, for her exceptional and meritorious public service as a person of Indian heritage in fostering friendly relations between India and Australia. In 2015, after the Labor Party's pre-selection ballot for the 2016 federal election, she was relegated to the fourth position on the Tasmanian Senate ticket in favour of John Short, state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. At the time, it was considered very unlikely that the Labor Party would win more than three Senate seats in Tasmania, so it was unlikely that Singh would be re-elected to the Senate. In 2016, with twelve senators to be elected due to the double dissolution, Singh was demoted to the sixth position on the ticket, described in some media reports as \\"unwinnable\\". Following a campaign to vote for Singh \\"below the line\\" on the ballot paper, she received 20,741 votes, 80% of a quota, which was enough to overturn the party's ticket order and she was elected as the 10th senator elected for Tasmania, with John Short missing out. She was the first person since Bill Aylett in 1953 to be elected to the Senate ahead of a higher-ranked candidate on the same ticket. In late 2016, Singh attended the United Nations General Assembly as one of two parliamentary delegates to the Australian mission to the United Nations. At the 2019 federal election, Singh was again placed in the \\"unwinnable\\" fourth position on Labor's Tasmanian Senate ticket. Once again there was a campaign for people to support her by voting below the line. She polled 5.9% of the vote, or 0.4 quotas, only slightly fewer than her vote in 2016, but that was not enough to survive, given the higher quota required at a half-Senate election. ==Policy Positions== Singh's parliamentary career has focused on the promotion and protection of human rights, international development, refugees, the environment, governance and access to justice, and law reform. She has published widely on these issues. Singh has advocated for advancing Australia‚Äôs economic ties with India and the wider Indo-Pacific; climate change awareness; asbestos compensation and law reform; and HIV/AIDS policy. Her achievements include initiating, coordinating and completing enquiries into banning Australia‚Äôs domestic trade in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn and initiating and undertaking an inquiry into human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, which contributed to the adoption of Australia‚Äôs first Modern Slavery Act ===Refugee advocacy=== Singh has been a strong advocate for the human rights of refugees and vocal opponent of Australia‚Äôs offshore detention of asylum seekers. She broke with the Labor Party‚Äôs official position to call for an end to indefinite offshore detention on the TV program Q&A;, as well as successfully moving a motion in the senate to call for greater transparency in offshore detention centres. Singh has spoken widely both nationally and international on refugee policy including presenting at Harvard University‚Äôs Kennedy School. ===Other causes=== Singh has also advocated for a number of international causes including: Rohingya refugees, Tibet, Palestine, and East Timor. She has also had an active interest in supporting women‚Äôs rights, the abolition of capital punishment, nuclear disarmament, same-sex marriage, the elimination of land mines, arts and culture, and the environment. ==References *Senate web page *Official website *Tasmanian Parliamentary Library profile *Lisa Singh's maiden speech to the Tasmanian parliament * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:Women members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly Category:University of Tasmania alumni Category:Australian republicans Category:Australian people of Indo-Fijian descent Category:Australian people of English descent Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st- century Australian women politicians Category:Women members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly Category:Recipients of Pravasi Bharatiya Samman ","title":"Lisa Singh"},{"id":"20405751","text":"Astragalus pycnostachyus is a species of milkvetch known by the common name marsh milkvetch.

What all types of defects have in common, whether surface or bulk defects, is that they produce dangling bonds that have specific electron energy levels different from those of the bulk. This difference occurs because these states cannot be described with periodic Bloch waves due to the change in electron potential energy caused by the missing ion cores just outside the surface. Hence, these are localized states that require separate solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation so that electron energies can be properly described. The break in periodicity results in a decrease in conductivity due to defect scattering. ==Electronic Energy Levels of Semiconductor Dangling Bonds== Figure 1: Harrison energy diagram of electron energies at different stages of forming a Si crystal. Vertical axis is energy. The 3s and 3p orbitals hybridize on a single Si atom which is energetically unfavorable because the 2 3s electrons gain more energy than the 2 3p electrons lose. Favorable dimer formation forms bonding (b) and anti-bonding (b*) states finally resulting in net energy loss and subsequent atom addition builds the crystal forming conduction (CB) and valence bands (VB). Dangling bond states (db) are equivalent to a missing sp3 bond. A simpler and more qualitative way of determining dangling bond energy levels is with Harrison diagrams.Harrison, Walter A., Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids: The Physics of the Chemical Bond. San Francisco: Freeman, 1980.Rockett, Angus, The Materials Science of Semiconductors. New York: Springer, 2007 Metals have non- directional bonding and a small Debye length which, due to their charged nature, makes dangling bonds inconsequential if they can even be considered to exist. Semiconductors are dielectrics so electrons can feel and become trapped at defect energy states. The energy levels of these states are determined by the atoms that make up the solid. Figure 1 shows the Harisson diagram for the elemental semiconductor Si. From left to right, s-orbital and p-orbital hybridization promotes sp3 bonding which, when multiple sp3 Si-Si dimers are combined to form a solid, defines the conduction and valence bands. If a vacancy were to exist, such as those on each atom at the solid/vacuum interface, it would result in at least one broken sp3 bond which has an energy equal to that of single self hybridized Si atoms as shown in Figure 1. This energy corresponds to roughly the middle of the bandgap of Si, ~0.55eV above the valence band. Certainly this is the most ideal case whereas the situation would be different if bond passivation (see below) and surface reconstruction, for example, were to occur. Experimentally, the energies of these states can be determined using absorption spectroscopy or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, for example, if instrument sensitivity and/or defect density are high enough. Figure 2: Harrison electron energy diagram for III-IV compound semiconductor GaAs. Same as for Si, the crystal is built with the addition of hybridized GaAs dimers. As vacancies cause Ga dangling bonds forming states near the CB. Ga vacancies produce As dangling bonds having energies near the VB. The VB is made primarily of \\"As-like\\" states since ionicity places electrons on As atoms and, as a consequence, CB states are \\"Ga-like\\". Compound semiconductors, such as GaAs, have dangling bond states that are nearer to the band edges (see Figure 2). As bonding becomes increasingly more ionic, these states can even act as dopants. This is the cause of the well known difficulty of GaN p-type doping where N vacancies are abundant due to its high vapor pressure resulting in high Ga dangling bond density. These states are close to the conduction band edge and therefore act as donors. When p-type acceptor dopants are introduced, they are immediately compensated for by the N vacancies. With these shallow states, their treatment is often considered as an analogue to the hydrogen atom as follows for the case of either anion or cation vacancies (hole effective mass, m*, for cation and electron m* for anion vacancies). The binding energy, Ec-Edb, is E_{c} - E_{db}=U+KE=\\\\frac{1}{2}U\\\\; \\\\; (1) where U=-q2/(4œÄŒµŒµrr) is the electrostatic potential between an electron occupying the dangling bond and its ion core with Œµ, the free space permittivity constant, Œµr, the relative permittivity, and r the electron-ion core separation. The simplification that the electron translational energy, KE=-U/2, is due to the virial theorem for centrosymmetric potentials. As described by the Bohr model, r is subject to quantization n\\\\lambda=2\\\\pi r \\\\; \\\\; (2). The electron momentum is p=mv=h/Œª such that KE=\\\\frac{p^{2}}{2m^{*}}=\\\\frac{h^{2}n^{2}}{8m^{*}\\\\pi ^{2}r^{2}}=-\\\\frac{U}{2}=\\\\frac{q^{2}}{8\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}r} \\\\; \\\\; (3) resulting in r=\\\\frac{4\\\\pi\\\\hbar^{2}n^{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}}{q^{2}m^{*}} \\\\; \\\\; (4) and E_{c} -E_{db}=\\\\frac{U}{2} = \\\\frac{m^{*}q^{4}}{8h^{2}(\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _ {r})^{2}}\\\\; \\\\; (5). This treatment loses accuracy as the defects tend away from either band edge. ==Defect Scattering== The dangling bond energy levels are eigenvalues of wavefunctions that describe electrons in the vicinity of the defects. In the typical consideration of carrier scattering, this corresponds to the final state in Fermi's golden rule of scattering frequency: S_{k'k}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar}^{2}\\\\delta (E_{f}-E_{i}) \\\\; \\\\; (6) with H' being the interaction parameter and the Dirac delta function, Œ¥(Ef- Ei), indicating elastic scattering. The simple relation 1/œÑ= Œ£k',k Sk'k makes this a useful equation for characterizing material transport properties when used in conjunction with œÉ = ne2œÑ /m* and Matthiessen's rule to incorporate other scattering processes. The value of Sk'k is primarily determined by the interaction parameter, H'. This term is different depending on whether shallow or deep states are considered. For shallow states, H' is the perturbation term of the redefined Hamiltonian H=Ho+H', with Ho having an eigenvalue energy of Ei. The matrix for this case is Hess, Karl, Advanced Theory of Semiconductor Devices. New York: Wiley Interscience, 2000. \\\\equiv M_{k'k}=\\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\int d\\\\bar{r} H'e^{i\\\\bar{r}(\\\\bar{k}-\\\\bar{k}')}=\\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\sum_{\\\\bar{q}}\\\\int d\\\\bar{r} H_{\\\\bar{q}}e^{i\\\\bar{r}(\\\\bar{k}-\\\\bar{k}'+\\\\bar{q})} = \\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\sum_{\\\\bar{q}} H_{\\\\bar{q}}\\\\delta _{\\\\bar{k}-\\\\bar{k}'},_{\\\\bar{q}}=\\\\frac{1}{V}H_{\\\\bar{q}} \\\\;\\\\; (7) where k' is the final state wavevector of which there is only one value since the defect density is small enough to not form bands (~<1010/cm2). Using the Poisson equation for Fourier periodic point charges, abla ^{2} V(\\\\bar{r}) =\\\\frac{-e\\\\delta (\\\\bar{r})}{\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _r}= -\\\\sum_{\\\\bar{q}}\\\\bar{q}^{2}V_{\\\\bar{q}}e^{i\\\\bar{q}\\\\bar{r}} = \\\\frac{-e}{V\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}}\\\\ \\\\sum_{\\\\bar{q}}e^{i\\\\bar{q}\\\\bar{r}} \\\\;\\\\; (8), gives the Fourier coefficient of the potential from a dangling bond Vq=e/(q2ŒµŒµrV) where V is volume. This results in H_{\\\\bar{q}}=-eV_{\\\\bar{q}} =\\\\frac{-e^{2}}{\\\\bar{q}^{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r} V}=\\\\frac{-e^{2}}{(\\\\bar{q}^{2} + q_{s}^{2})\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r} V} \\\\;\\\\; (9) where qs is the Debye length wavevector correction due to charge screening. Then, the scattering frequency is \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = \\\\sum_{\\\\bar{k}',\\\\bar{k}} S_{\\\\bar{k}'\\\\bar{k}}=n\\\\sum_{\\\\bar{k}}\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar}\\\\frac{e^{4}\\\\delta (E_{\\\\bar{k}}-E_{\\\\bar{k}'})}{\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}V[\\\\bar{q}^{2}-q_{s}^{2}]^{2}}=\\\\frac{ne^{4}}{4\\\\pi^{2}\\\\hbar \\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}}\\\\int \\\\int \\\\int dk d\\\\theta d\\\\phi \\\\frac{k^{2} sin\\\\theta \\\\; \\\\delta (E_{\\\\bar{k}}-E_{\\\\bar{k}'})}{[\\\\bar{q}^{2}-q_{s}^{2}]^{2}} \\\\;\\\\; (10) where n is the volumetric defect density. Performing the integration, utilizing k=k', gives \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = \\\\frac{ne^{4}}{2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2m^{*}(E_{c}-E_{db})}\\\\hbar ^{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\varepsilon _{r}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{q_s^{2}}-\\\\frac{1}{q_{s}^{2}+\\\\frac{8m^{*}(E_{c}-E_{db})}{\\\\hbar^{2}}} \\\\right) \\\\;\\\\; (11). The above treatment falters when the defects are not periodic since dangling bond potentials are represented with a Fourier series. Simplifying the sum by the factor of n in Eq (10) was only possible due to low defect density. If every atom (or possibly every other) were to have one dangling bond, which is quite reasonable for a non-reconstructed surface, the integral on k' must also be performed. Due to the use of perturbation theory in defining the interaction matrix, the above assumes small values of H' or, shallow defect states close to band edges. Fortunately, Fermi's golden rule itself is quite general and can be used for deep state defects if the interaction between conduction electron and defect is understood well enough to model their interaction into an operator that replaces H'. ==Experimental measurements== Figure 3: (Top) Simple source-drain voltage sweeps with increasing defect density can be used to extract a carrier scattering rate and dangling bond energy (red curve having more defects). (Bottom) Temperature dependence of resistivity. Near absolute zero, the weight of defects on carrier scattering is revealed. Determination of the extent these dangling bonds have on electrical transport can be experimentally observed fairly readily. By sweeping the voltage across a conductor (Figure 3), the resistance, and with a defined geometry, the conductivity of the sample can be determined. As mentioned before, œÉ = ne2œÑ /m*, where œÑ can be determined knowing n and m* from the Fermi level position and material band structure. Unfortunately, this value contains effects from other scattering mechanisms such as due to phonons. This gains usefulness when the measurement is used alongside Eq (11) where the slope of a plot of 1/œÑ versus n makes Ec-Edb calculable and the intercept determines 1/œÑ from all but defect scattering processes. This requires the assumption that phonon scattering (among other, possibly negligible processes) is independent of defect concentration. In a similar experiment, one can just lower the temperature of the conductor (Figure 3) so that phonon density decreases to negligible allowing defect dominant resistivity. With this case, œÉ = ne2œÑ /m* can be used to directly calculate œÑ for defect scattering. ==Passivation== Figure 4: Hydrogen passivation of a Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) for reduction of Si/SiO2 interface states. Hydrogen bonds to Si fully satisfying sp3 hybridization providing defect state occupancy preventing carrier scattering into these states. Surface defects can always be \\"passivated\\" with atoms to purposefully occupy the corresponding energy levels so that conduction electrons cannot scatter into these states (effectively decreasing n in Eq (10)). For example, Si passivation at the channel/oxide interface of a MOSFET with hydrogen (Figure 4) is a typical procedure to help reduce the ~1010 cm‚àí2 defect density by up to a factor of 12Faughnan, B.; Ipri, A. C. IEEE Trans. Elec. Dev. 36, 101, 1999. thereby improving mobility and, hence, switching speeds. Removal of intermediary states which would otherwise reduce tunneling barriers also decreases gate leakage current and increases gate capacitance as well as transient response. The effect is that the Si sp3 bonding becomes fully satisfied. The obvious requirement here is the ability for the semiconductor to oxidize the passivating atom or, Ec-Edb \\\\+ œá > EI, with the semiconductor electron affinity œá and atom ionization energy EI. ==Phonon Scattering== We now consider carrier scattering with lattice deformations termed phonons. Consider the volumetric displacement such a propagating wave produces, \\\\Delta V_{0}, which consequently results in a time-dependent strain, \\\\Delta V_{0}/V_{0}=\\\\bigtriangledown u(r,t) where a simple plane wave is used to describe the phonon propagation, u(r,t)\\\\propto exp\\\\pm(iqr-i\\\\omega t) . Displacement of atoms away from their equilibrium positions generally causes a change in the electronic band structure (Figure 5) where, for scattering, we are concerned with electrons in the conduction band with energy ~ECB, \\\\Delta E_{CB}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} E_{CB} }{\\\\mathrm{d} V_{0}}\\\\Delta V_{0} = V_{0} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} E_{CB} }{\\\\mathrm{d} V_{0}} \\\\frac {\\\\Delta V_{0}}{V_{0}}=Z_{DP}\\\\cdot \\\\bigtriangledown u(r,t) \\\\; \\\\; (12). The empirical parameter, ZDP, is termed the deformation potential and describes electron-phonon coupling strength. Multiplying by the phonon population (Bose‚ÄìEinstein distribution, Nq) gives the total deformation potential, \\\\Delta E_{CB}^{Tot}=\\\\widehat{H}_{int}=Z_{DP}\\\\cdot \\\\bigtriangledown u(r,t)\\\\sqrt{N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}}=\\\\pm i q Z_{DP} u(r,t)\\\\sqrt{N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\; \\\\; (13) Figure 5: Schematic of changing energy band edges (conduction band, E CB, and valence band E VB) as the atomic positions of the crystal are displaced from equilibrium to produce a volumetric strain. (the reason for the root will be apparent below). Here, the + corresponds to phonon emission and ‚Äì for phonon absorption during the scattering event. A note, because q\\\\perp u(r,t) for transverse phonons, only interactions with longitudinal phonons are non-zero. Therefore, the complete interaction matrix is =\\\\pm i q Z_{DP} u(r,t)\\\\sqrt{N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\delta _{k', k \\\\pm q} \\\\; \\\\; (14) where the Kronecker delta enforces momentum conservation and arises from assuming the electronic wavefunctions (final state, , and initial state, k>) are plane waves as well. ==Acoustic Phonons== Using Fermi's golden rule, the scattering rate for low energy acoustic phonons can be approximated. The interaction matrix for these phonons is ^{2}=Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}}{2V\\\\rho c^{2}} (N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2})\\\\delta _{k', k \\\\pm q} \\\\; \\\\; (15) with the phonon radial frequency œâq=cq, volume V, solid density œÅ, and phonon group velocity c.Conwell, E. M., \\"High Field Transport in Semiconductors,\\" in Solid State Physics, ed. F. Seitz, D. Turnbull, and H. Ehrenreich, Supplement 9. New York: Academic Press, 1967, p. 108. Plugging this into Eq. 6 gives S_{k'k}^{Ac}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar} Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}}{2V\\\\rho c^{2}} (N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2})\\\\delta _{k', k \\\\pm q}\\\\delta [E(k')-E(k) \\\\pm \\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}] \\\\; \\\\; (16). With the assumptions that Nq>>1, ƒßœâ<\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = \\\\sum_{k'} S_{k'k}^{Ac}=\\\\sum_{k} S_{k\\\\pm q ,k}^{Ac} =\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar} Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}}{2V\\\\rho c^{2}} (\\\\frac{kT}{\\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}}) \\\\sum_{k} \\\\delta _{k', k \\\\pm q}\\\\delta [E(k')-E(k) \\\\pm \\\\hbar \\\\omega _{q}] =\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar} Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{kT}{2V\\\\rho c^{2}} V \\\\times g(E) =\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt 2}{\\\\pi}\\\\frac{Z_{DP}^{2} m^{*\\\\frac{3}{2}}kT}{\\\\rho \\\\hbar ^{4}c^{2}} \\\\sqrt{E-E_{CB}} \\\\; \\\\; (17) where g(E) is the electronic density of states for which the 3-dimensional solution with parabolic dispersion was used to obtain the final answer. ==Optical Phonons== Typically, phonons in the optical branches of vibrational dispersion relationships have energies on the order of or greater than kT and, therefore, the approximations ƒßœâ<q>>1 cannot be made. Yet, a reasonable route that still provides a detour from dealing with complex phonon dispersions is using the Einstein model which states that only one phonon mode exists in solids. For optical phonons, this approximation turns out to be sufficient due to very little slope variation in œâ(q) and, thus, we can claim ƒßœâ(q) ‚âÖ ƒßœâ, a constant. Consequently, Nq is also a constant (only T dependent). The last approximation, g(E')=g(E¬±ƒßœâ) ~ g(E), cannot be made since ƒßœâ ~ E and there is no workaround for it, but the added complexity to the sum for œÑ is minimal. \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} = \\\\sum_{k'} S_{k'k}^{Op}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\hbar} Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{2V\\\\rho c^{2}} (N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\sum_{k'} \\\\delta _{k', k \\\\pm q}\\\\delta [E(k')-E(k) \\\\pm \\\\hbar \\\\omega] =Z_{DP}^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{8 \\\\pi ^2 \\\\hbar\\\\rho c^{2}} (N_{q}+\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}) g(E \\\\pm \\\\hbar \\\\omega) \\\\; \\\\; (18) . The sum turns to the density of states at E' and the Bose‚ÄìEinstein distribution can be taken out of the sum due to ƒßœâ(q) ‚âÖ ƒßœâ. ==Notes== Category:Scattering theory ","title":"Carrier scattering"},{"id":"20405762","text":"KREF (1400 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Sports radio format.

Launched in 2007, Amazon Pay uses the consumer base of Amazon.com and focuses on giving users the option to pay with their Amazon accounts on external merchant websites. As of January 2019, the service is available in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, Republic of Ireland, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. Amazon Pay announced a partnership with WorldPay in 2019 allowing WorldPay clients to enable Amazon Pay as a part of the same integration. ==Products== Amazon Pay incorporates a variety of products for buyers and merchants to process online payments. ===Amazon Pay=== Amazon Pay provides the option to purchase goods and services from websites and mobile apps using the addresses and payment methods stored in the Amazon account, such as credit cards or a direct debit bank account or the unified payments interface in India. ===Amazon Pay Express=== Amazon Pay Express is a payments processing service for simple E-commerce use cases on websites. Built on Amazon Pay but without requiring a full E-commerce integration it uses a Java button code generator to create a button that can be copied and pasted onto a website or added via WordPress Plug-in. It is best suited for merchants selling a small number of products and with a single item in each order, such as a digital download. ==Evolution== Amazon Pay has undergone many changes in its evolution to improve the online payments processing for Amazon customers on external websites. While Amazon Pay is the most recent product, it represents the culmination of previous trial and error products, and strategic acquisitions. ===Checkout by Amazon (CBA)=== CBA was an E-commerce solution that allowed web merchants to accept Amazon account information and use Amazon for payment processing. CBA could manage several aspects of the transaction including order processing, promotional discounts, shipping rates, sales tax calculation, and up-selling. Depending on the needs of the merchant, CBA could be integrated into the merchant's systems with manual processing (through Seller Central) or through SOAP APIs or downloadable CSV files. CBA also claimed to reduce bad debt because of Amazon's fraud detection capabilities. CBA was discontinued in the UK and Germany in 2016 and is set for discontinuation in the U.S. in April 2017. ===Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS)=== FPS was an Amazon Web Service that allowed the transfer of money between two entities using a technology built on single, multiple, and unlimited use payment tokens. Merchants managed their use of the service via API or solution providers and accessed the account through the merchant account on the Amazon Payments website. The service was launched as a limited beta in August 2007, and later in February 2009 was promoted to General Availability [6]. FPS differed from CBA in that FPS did not handle additional capabilities associated with order processing such as promotions, tax, and shipping. FPS also provided the payments processing for the Amazon Web Services DevPay service (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/make-money-fast/) but was discontinued on June 1, 2015. === GoPago technology acquisition=== Amazon in 2013 acquired GoPago's technology (mPayment) and hired their engineering and product teams. Amazon was interested in the mobile payment business. GoPago's app allows shoppers to order and pay for goods and services before they arrive at a business. ==Security== In September 22, 2010, Amazon published a security advisory regarding a security flaw in its Amazon Payments SDKs. This flaw allows a malicious shopper to shop for free in web stores using those SDKs. Amazon mandated all web stores to upgrade to its new SDKs before Nov. 1, 2010. Amazon acknowledged security researcher Rui Wang for finding this bug. The detail of the flaw is documented in the paper \\"How to Shop for Free Online - Security Analysis of Cashier-as-a-Service Based Web Stores\\" by Rui Wang, Shuo Chen, XiaoFeng Wang, and Shaz Qadeer. ==See also== *PayPal *List of on-line payment service providers ==References *Official website Payments Category:Financial services companies established in 2007 Category:Banking technology Category:Online payments Category:Mobile payments Category:WordPress ","title":"Amazon Pay"},{"id":"20405850","text":"KMFS (1490 AM) is a radio station licensed to Guthrie, Oklahoma, and serving the Oklahoma City Metroplex.

It broadcasts at 1,000 watts around the clock, using a non-directional antenna. ==History== KWRW went on air in 1956.

A year after signing on, Weldon Sledge, who had run a station in Morrilton, Arkansas, bought KWRW, but he only owned it for a year, as Guthrie Broadcasters‚Äîowned by Farrell and Norma Sue Brooks‚Äîacquired the station in 1958. The carousel of ownership changes continued; at the end of 1959, KWRW was sold to Howard Daniel Smith, and in mid-1961, the Austin Oil Company bought the radio station. The call letters were changed to KOKC on December 15, 1970; the next year, Austin Oil won approval to increase the station's daytime power to 500 watts and relocate the transmitter, changes that came into effect in 1972.

Certain bacteria, such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans, which are also used in the mineral refinement process of bioleaching, utilize the chemical energy from oxidation of iron or copper to fix carbon dioxide from the air. A metal object, when placed in a culture fluid containing these metal-metabolizing bacteria, will have material removed from its surface over time. Biomachining is ideal for micromachining due to its very low material removal rate. In addition, biomachining is less likely to leave an undesirable surface finish; neither chemical nor physical energy is concentrated on the cutting area, so the possibility of a damaged or burned surface is slim. This process has been successfully used to cut both pure iron and pure copper. ==Process== Biomachining is performed in a manner similar to chemical milling: the area to be cut is marked out as a negative image with an inert maskant, used to protect the areas that are not to be cut. The part is then dipped into a bath of culture fluid, which is kept at a precise temperature and stirred throughout the process. Laboratory experiments on the subject have determined that the depth of any cuts produced increases as the stirring rate increases; this depth is also affected by the temperature of the process. ==Sources== * Category:Machining ","title":"Biomachining"},{"id":"20406069","text":"Astragalus sabulonum is a species of milkvetch known by the common name gravel milkvetch.

He served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Health from 1992 to 1993 and as Minister of National Solidarity and Humanitarian Action from 1997 to 2002, with additional responsibility for the health portfolio beginning in 1999. Subsequently he was a Deputy in the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007 and again from 2007 to 2011. He was also President of the New Democratic Forces (FDN), a political party, from 2007 to 2011; when the FDN merged itself into the ruling Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in July 2011, Opimbat became a member of the PCT Political Bureau. He was Minister of Sports from 2011 to 2017, and he has been First Vice-President of the National Assembly since 2017. ==Political career== Opimbat studied in France at the University of Caen and received a degree in medicine. In Congo- Brazzaville, he worked as chief medical officer in charge of health and social services at Marien Ngouabi University in Brazzaville and in a similar capacity at the National Electrical Company. In the June-July 1992 parliamentary election, Opimbat was first elected to the National Assembly as a candidate in the Mbomo constituency of Cuvette-Ouest Region.\\"Morts et ressuscit√©s...\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 10 December 2007 .

Following the June-October 1997 civil war, Opimbat, who was President of the Congolese Association for Openness, Salvation and Solidarity (ACOSS), was appointed to the government as Minister of National Solidarity, the Displaced and the Victims of War, in charge of Humanitarian Action, on 2 November 1997.March√©s tropicaux et m√©diterran√©ens, issues 2,704-2,720 (1997), page 2,429 .Paul Soni-Benga, Les dessous de la guerre du Congo-Brazzaville (1998), L'Harmattan, page 275 . He was subsequently moved to the post of Minister of Health, Solidarity, and Humanitarian Action on 12 January 1999.\\"Le nouveau gouvernement du Congo\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 13 January 1999 . After a number of people died of the Ebola virus, apparently due to eating primate meat, Opimbat announced a ban on the consumption of primate meat in the northwestern part of the country, near the Gabonese border, on 5 February 2002.\\"Govt bans primate meat eating in north-western Congo\\", Panapress, 6 February 2002. In April 2002, he called for international aid to help thousands of people who had fled their homes in the Pool Region due to violence involving rebel Ninja militia fighters.\\"Congo seeks international relief for displaced persons\\", Panapress, 9 April 2002. In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Opimbat was elected to the National Assembly as the ACOSS candidate in Mbomo constituency; he won the seat in the first round with 59.08% of the vote.\\"Elections l√©gislatives : les 51 √©lus du premier tour\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 5 June 2002 .

The newspaper Le Choc reported on 20 July 2004 that Opimbat, together with a minister and two other former ministers, had been barred from leaving the country without Sassou Nguesso's approval due to suspicions that they had misused public funds. This report was denied on the next day by public prosecutor Georges Aki√©ra.\\"Congo desmente proibi√ß√£o de sa√≠da de ministros do pa√≠s\\", Panapress, 21 July 2004 . In March 2007, ACOSS agreed to merge with several other parties to create a new party, the New Democratic Forces (FDN).Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \\"Bokilo, Opimbat, Tassoua, Loumouamou et les autres se mettent ensemble et cr√©ent leur parti, les F.d.n\\", Le Semaine Africaine, number 2,686, 13 April 2007, page 3 . At the FDN's constitutive congress (19-21 April 2007), Opimbat was chosen to jointly head the FDN's National Executive Bureau together with Jean-Marie Tassoua,Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Les Forces d√©mocratiques nouvelles se donnent deux ans de transition\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 23 April 2007 . and on 15 May he and Tassoua signed an electoral agreement on behalf of the FDN with the governing Congolese Labour Party (PCT).\\"Les Forces d√©mocratiques nouvelles et le Parti congolais du travail signent un accord √©lectoral\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 16 May 2007 . In the June-August 2007 parliamentary election, Opimbat was the FDN candidate in Mbomo constituency, but in the first round of the election, held on 24 June 2007, he was defeated by Jean Matamaya, the candidate of the Movement for Solidarity and Development (MSD), who won a narrow majority with about 52% of the vote.\\"Elections l√©gislatives : les 44 √©lus du premier tour\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 July 2007 . Opimbat rejected this result and filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court; on 26 October 2007, the Constitutional Court ruled in his favor, ordering that the election be held over again in Mbomo. In the revote, held on 7 December 2007, Opimbat won the seat, receiving 61.46% of the vote.Jean- Claude Nkou, \\"R√©sultats des √©lections l√©gislatives partielles\\" , Congo-Site, 28 December 2007 . He thus became one of three FDN deputies in the National Assembly. As of 2008, Opimbat is a member of the National Coordination of the Rally of the Presidential Majority (RMP), a large coalition of parties supporting President Denis Sassou Nguesso.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le RMP installe ses organes dirigeants dans le d√©partement de la Cuvette-Ouest\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 30 October 2008 .

After several years of dual leadership alongside Tassoua, Opimbat was elected as the sole President of the FDN at its First Ordinary Congress on 2-3 May 2010. On that occasion, he reaffirmed the party's participation in the RMP coalition and said that the FDN was a social democratic party.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Les Forces d√©mocratiques nouvelles ont d√©sormais un seul pr√©sident\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 4 May 2008 .

The song reached #22 UK in December 2008 via a remake by Gabriella Cilmi titled \\"Warm This Winter\\". ==Connie Francis versionBackground=== \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was written by Mark Barkan with Hank Hunter. Hunter wrote several songs recorded by Connie Francis including her Top Ten singles \\"Second Hand Love\\" and \\"Vacation\\". Connie Francis previously had a seasonally themed hit single with \\"Baby's First Christmas\\", which peaked at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #7 on the same magazine's then-new Easy Listening (now Adult Contemporary) chart during the 1961 holiday season, and although she would not have a single released during the holidays in 1963, her hit \\"Blue Winter\\" was released in January 1964 - still in the season of winter, and peaked at #24 on the Hot 100, and #7 on Billboard's Easy Listening (Adult Contemporary) chart sometime after spring started. ===Recording=== The original track and two introductions were recorded with producer Danny Davis in New York City on September 13, 1962: the orchestral arrangement for the session was by Bill Ramal whose credits included the arrangement for the Del Shannon hit \\"Runaway\\". The session personnel included drummer Gary Chester. Besides the original intro: \\"We met at a ski lodge/ And we fell in love\\", Francis recorded a distinct intro for the track's UK release: \\"We met on a winter day/ And we fell in love\\", the reasoning being that the \\"ski lodge\\" reference would fail to resonate in the UK that nation having virtually no facilities for skiing. Francis overdubbed a harmony vocal in a November 3 session also produced by Davis: although Francis is known for her double-vocal recordings, \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" is one of very few tracks on which Francis is self-harmonied throughout.Ron Roberts: Connie Francis Discography 1955‚Äì1975, revised editions 1979, 1983Connie Francis: Souvenirs, Booklet of 4-CD-Box, Polydor 1996, Cat.-No. 314 533 382-2Ron Roberts: Connie Francis Discography 1955 ‚Äì 1975 ===US release=== \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was issued in the US at the beginning of December 1962: Francis promoted the track on the December 13 broadcast of American Bandstand marking Francis first appearance on the show since 1958. \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" reached the Top 20 in a number of regional markets generally peaking outside the Top Ten, although the track was especially successful in Seattle reaching #4 and #5 on the hit parades of respectively KOL and KJR in January 1963. The national peak of #18 was reached in both Billboard and Cashbox on their respective singles charts dated January 26, 1963. In January 1963 the original B-side of \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\": \\"Al di l√†\\", picked up enough airplay to reach #90 on the Billboard Hot 100 (#87 in Cash Box). \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" made its album debut on The Very Best of Connie Francis compilation album release in September 1963. ===International release=== In the UK \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" spent a single week in the Top 50 appearing at #48 on the chart dated December 22, 1962 marking Francis' final UK chart appearance for almost three years. \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" reached #1 in Hong Kong in February 1963; also in early 1963 the track reached #9 in Australia, to become Francis' final Top 20 hit in that nation, and #28 in the Netherlands. In its international release \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" retained \\"Al di l√†\\" as its B-side in some territories including Australia while in some other territories - including the UK - the B-side of \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was \\"Pretty Little Baby\\". Two territories had evidently unique releases of Francis' \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\": in New Zealand the track had Francis' rendition of \\"I Walk the Line\\" as its flip with neither side marked A-side or B-side, while in Sweden \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was made a B-side to \\"Playin' Games\\" which afforded Francis a #17 hit in April 1963. (Recorded in the same September 13, 1962 recording session as \\"I\\"m Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" and likewise a Barkan-Hunter composition, \\"Playin' Games\\" was issued in territories other than Sweden - including the UK - with \\"I Was Such a Fool\\" - Francis' precedent US A-side release to \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" - as B-side).45cat - Vinyl Database - Records - Music Reviews - Discographies, Discussions, DiscoveriesMichel Rupli, Ed Novitsky; The MGM Labels: A Discography, Volume 2; Greenwood Press Westport CT (1998) p. 79 ===Non-English versions=== \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" is one of the few Connie Francis hits remade by the singer in French, that rendering titled \\"L'Amour Est Un Cadeau Du Ciel\\" being recorded February 10, 1963. Unlike the English original, both single vocal and harmony vocal versions of the French interpretation were marketed in Canada and France. In June 1963 Francis overdubbed a Japanese vocal on the track of \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" with the resultant track entitled ÊÉ≥„ÅÑÂá∫„ÅÆÂÜ¨‰ºë„Åø (romanized spelling: Omoide No Fuyuyasumi) (Winter of '42); Francis had overdubbed an Italian vocal on the track of \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" on February 25, 1963 with the resultant track: \\"Sul monti blu\\" (The blue mountains) never being released. ===1989 version=== \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was one of seventeen Connie Francis hits which the singer remade for her 1989 album Where the Hits Are a Roger Hawkins production recorded for Malaco Records at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios. \\"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter\\" was the lowest-charting hit remade for the album with the exception of \\"If I Didn't Care\\" (#22). ===Charts=== {  !align=\\"center\\"Chart (1962) !align=\\"center\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"UK Singles Chart align=\\"center\\"48 } ==Gabriella Cilmi version== In 2008 The Co-operative Food had Australian singer Gabriella Cilmi remake the song ‚Äî re-titled \\"Warm This Winter\\" ‚Äî to be played during the company's advertising aired over the holiday season. The track was also played heavily in the Co-operative's stores. Cilmi's version uses neither of the opening lines from the two intros recorded by Connie Francis instead opening with the lyric: \\"We met in the winter\\". An instrumental version of the song continued to be used in advertisements during the non-holiday period (generally February to October) till around 2011.

The knockout phase involves the 16 teams who finished in the top two in each of their groups in the group stage. Each tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, will be played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs will progress to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs will progress. If away goals are also equal, 30 minutes of extra time are played. If there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, there will be a penalty shoot-out after extra time. In the draw for the first knockout round, matches are played between the winner of one group and the runner-up of a different group. The only restriction on the drawing of teams in the first knockout round is that the teams must not be from the same national association or have played in the same group in the group stages. From the quarter-finals onwards, these restrictions do not apply. In the final, the tie is played over just one leg at a neutral venue.

English side Arsenal gained a first leg advantage with a 1‚Äì0 home victory against Roma at the Emirates Stadium, courtesy of Robin van Persie's 37th-minute penalty. The other English team in action, Manchester United, drew 0‚Äì0 with Internazionale at the San Siro, failing to score the away goal they had been hoping for. The other two matches finished in score draws, with the away sides having the upper hand going into the second legs. Lyon drew 1‚Äì1 with Barcelona at the Stade de Gerland in France, with Barcelona's Thierry Henry cancelling out an opener from Juninho. Porto came from behind twice away to Atl√©tico Madrid to secure a 2‚Äì2 draw at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium. Maxi Rodr√≠guez put Atl√©tico in front in the fourth minute, Lisandro L√≥pez equalised in the 22nd minute, Diego Forl√°n scored on the stroke of half-time to restore Atl√©tico's advantage but L√≥pez levelled in the 72nd minute.

In the match at the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade, Franck Rib√©ry gave the Germans the lead in the 42nd minute and Miroslav Klose doubled their advantage in the 57th. Rib√©ry scored again from the penalty spot in the 63rd before a brace from Luca Toni put the tie out of Sporting's reach, even before the second leg. Five-time winners Liverpool also managed an away win, against nine-time winners Real Madrid, but had to wait until the 82nd minute at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium for it, when Yossi Benayoun scored a header from F√°bio Aur√©lio's free-kick to hand them the advantage for the second leg. Villarreal and Panathinaikos shared a score draw at the Estadio El Madrigal, with Giuseppe Rossi scoring a 67th-minute penalty to cancel out Giorgos Karagounis' 59th-minute opener. In the other game, Chelsea beat Juventus at Stamford Bridge courtesy of a 12th-minute strike from Didier Drogba. \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ===Second leg=== In the four second leg ties played on 10 March, the two English clubs in action both progressed along with Bayern Munich and Villarreal. Liverpool eliminated the nine-time European Cup winners Real Madrid with a 4‚Äì0 home victory. Fernando Torres doubled Liverpool's aggregate lead in the 16th minute, and Steven Gerrard made it 2‚Äì0 on the night with a 28th-minute penalty. Gerrard further extended Liverpool's lead two minutes after half-time and Andrea Dossena made it 5‚Äì0 on aggregate with two minutes left. Chelsea also made it through to the quarter-finals with a 2‚Äì2 draw, having won the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1‚Äì0. They fell behind to a goal from Vincenzo Iaquinta in the 19th minute but equalised through Michael Essien on the stroke of half-time. Juventus went back in front through an Alessandro Del Piero penalty, although Chelsea were heading through on the away goals ruling. Chelsea sealed their passage to the last eight when Didier Drogba equalised in the 83rd minute to win 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. In the other games, Sporting CP departed the competition after setting a new Champions League record aggregate defeat of 12‚Äì1 to Bayern Munich. An early goal from Lukas Podolski extended Bayern's lead to 6‚Äì0 on aggregate and this was followed up by further strikes before half-time from Podolski again, √Çnderson Polga and Bastian Schweinsteiger, sandwiched by a consolation from Sporting's Jo√£o Moutinho. Bayern were not finished at 4‚Äì1 as Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose and Thomas M√ºller further added to the scoreline. Villarreal were the fourth side to make it into the quarter-finals by beating Panathinaikos 3‚Äì2 overall. Ariel Ibagaza put Villarreal 2‚Äì1 up on aggregate in the 49th minute, Evangelos Mantzios equalised six minutes later, but Joseba Llorente turned the tie in Villarreal's favour in the 70th minute and the match finished 2‚Äì1 to Villarreal. The remaining two English sides both reached the quarter-finals on 11 March and they were joined by Porto and Barcelona. Manchester United defeated Internazionale 2‚Äì0 on aggregate at Old Trafford. After a 0‚Äì0 draw at the San Siro in the first leg, United were aware that an away goal for Inter would make it difficult, but they made the perfect start with centre back Nemanja Vidiƒá scoring with a header after four minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo doubled the lead just after half-time and the match finished 2‚Äì0. Porto and Atl√©tico Madrid played out a 0‚Äì0 draw at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in Portugal, but Porto went through on the away goals rule, having scored twice in a 2‚Äì2 draw in Spain.

Lyon scored two consolation goals through Jean Makoun on the stroke of half-time and Juninho just after the break, but Barcelona added a fifth in the final minute. In the last game to finish, Roma defeated Arsenal 1‚Äì0 at the Stadio Olimpico with Juan scoring in the ninth minute.

There was no seeding and no country protection, meaning that it was an entirely random draw. The first legs were played on 7/8 April while the second legs were played on 14/15 April. Liverpool requested that their second leg be played on 14 April so that it avoid a clash with the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April. } ===First leg=== English sides Manchester United and Arsenal were involved in the first two quarter-final matches on 7 April. Arsenal were playing the first leg away against Villarreal from Spain, their second encounter in three years following on from a meeting in the semi- finals three years earlier. Villarreal went in front in the 10th minute thanks to a long-range effort from Marcos Senna. The Yellow Submarine went on to dominate the first half, but Arsenal did not concede again and their defensive work was rewarded in the 66th minute as a clipped ball from Arsenal captain Cesc F√†bregas was controlled on the chest by Emmanuel Adebayor and volleyed acrobatically with an overhead kick into the bottom corner. The match eventually finished 1‚Äì1, with Arsenal taking an away goal into the second leg. Manchester United played their first leg at home at Old Trafford against Porto, the team who had knocked them out in the first knockout round five years before. Porto took an early lead, in the fourth minute, when Cristian Rodr√≠guez netted past Edwin van der Sar. The advantage lasted only 11 minutes, however, at which point Wayne Rooney scored the equaliser, chipping the ball over the advancing Helton following a careless back-pass from Bruno Alves. In an open game, in which Porto dominated, another goal appeared certain but did not come until the 85th minute. Carlos Tevez saw off his marker to score from a Rooney flick from a couple of yards out. The action had not finished however and Mariano Gonz√°lez equalised in the final minute to hand Porto a second away goal. Liverpool and Chelsea faced each other in an all-English tie at Anfield on 8 April. The sides were meeting in the Champions League for the fifth straight season, having last faced each other in the competition in the 2008 semi-final, when Chelsea advanced to the final. Fernando Torres handed an early advantage to Liverpool, scoring in the sixth minute. However, their lead only lasted until the 39th minute when the Liverpool defence allowed Branislav Ivanoviƒá too much space at a corner and he was able to power a header past Pepe Reina. Chelsea took the lead in the 62nd minute from an almost identical situation as Ivanoviƒá scored his second headed goal. Didier Drogba added a final goal to make it 3‚Äì1 to the away side with a side-footed finish. In the final game, played on the same evening, two of the most successful European clubs, Barcelona and Bayern Munich met at the Camp Nou in Spain. It was their first meeting since the group stage of the 1998‚Äì99 tournament. Bayern had beaten Sporting CP 12‚Äì1 in the previous round, but Barcelona posed a far tougher proposition and it showed. Lionel Messi put Barcelona in front in the ninth minute and Samuel Eto'o doubled the lead three minutes later. Messi scored his second goal in the 38th minute and Thierry Henry made it 4‚Äì0 in the 43rd minute. The score remained at 4‚Äì0 throughout the second half, leaving Barcelona as favourites to progress. \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ===Second leg=== Robin van Persie takes a free kick against Villarreal. In the first two of four second-leg ties, Chelsea came with a 3‚Äì1 advantage over Liverpool and the bonus of three away goals, Liverpool came into their match knowing they needed to score three times without conceding to progress, or win 3‚Äì1 to take the game to extra time at Stamford Bridge. Despite starting the match as outsiders, Liverpool looked to be well on the way towards their target as they took a 2‚Äì0 lead within half an hour and levelled the scores at 3‚Äì3 on aggregate. F√°bio Aur√©lio scored directly with a free kick from the left of the penalty area in the 19th minute to hand them the lead and this was doubled nine minutes later from the penalty spot: Xabi Alonso stepped up to score following a foul on him by Branislav Ivanoviƒá. But six minutes after half- time, Didier Drogba made the score 2‚Äì1 with a shot that went through the hands of Pepe Reina, and six minutes later, Chelsea equalised to 2‚Äì2 when Alex scored with a powerful free kick. Frank Lampard put Chelsea 3‚Äì2 up in the 76th minute and, at this stage, Liverpool needed to score three goals to advance. Goals from Lucas and Dirk Kuyt in the 81st and 83rd minutes, respectively, put Liverpool 4‚Äì3 up on the night and only a goal away from advancing. However, Lampard scored again in the 89th minute to finish the tie off, and the match ended 4‚Äì4 and 7‚Äì5 to Chelsea overall. In the other match to take place that evening, Barcelona and Bayern Munich played out a 1‚Äì1 draw at the Allianz Arena. Bayern trailed the tie 4‚Äì0 following the first match at the Camp Nou and they were able to play without fear in the first half. Luca Toni and Franck Rib√©ry created chances in the first half but Barcelona weathered the storm and created their only meaningful chance of the first half through Dani Alves. They managed to pull a goal back early in the second half, when Z√© Roberto took the ball past defender Yaya Tour√© and set up Rib√©ry who was able to score past V√≠ctor Vald√©s. But Barcelona put the tie beyond the reach of Bayern with an equaliser from Seydou Keita at the end of a 17-pass move. The match finished 1‚Äì1, giving Barcelona a 5‚Äì1 aggregate win to set up a fourth tie with Chelsea in five seasons two weeks later. The third second-leg tie was finely poised at 1‚Äì1 between Arsenal and Villarreal at the Emirates Stadium, with Arsenal ahead courtesy of the away goals rule; Villarreal came into the match knowing they had to score. Both teams were without key players: Arsenal had to play without goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, William Gallas and Ga√´l Clichy while captain Marcos Senna and Santi Cazorla were missing for Villarreal. Theo Walcott delivered some dangerous crosses and Robin van Persie missed an early chance from Samir Nasri's cross, but Diego God√≠n also tested Arsenal goalkeeper ≈Åukasz Fabia≈Ñski with a volley. Arsenal, however, took the lead in the 10th minute as Walcott raced onto a F√†bregas through-ball and chipped the ball over Diego L√≥pez. Villarreal continued to create chances, including Robert Pires nearly marking his return to his former club with a goal. Emmanuel Adebayor followed up a Van Persie free kick with a header on goal, but Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez cleared the ball off the line. After half-time, Van Persie had a shot from distance charged down, but Arsenal did score a second goal in the 60th minute as Van Persie opted to slide a pass through to Adebayor, and his strike partner applied the finish. The tie was over in the 69th minute when God√≠n was adjudged to have fouled Walcott; Sebasti√°n Eguren collected a second yellow card for his protests before Van Persie scored from the penalty spot. The match finished 3‚Äì0 to Arsenal, with Arsenal winning 4‚Äì1 on aggregate. The final quarter-final second leg tie was between Porto and Manchester United, played simultaneously with Arsenal's match. Porto had the advantage of two away goals, after drawing 2‚Äì2 at Old Trafford. Manchester United looked to recall Rio Ferdinand from a back injury to partner Nemanja Vidiƒá in central defence. Despite a mixed season, Cristiano Ronaldo had still scored 20 goals in all competitions and won numerous awards and he added his 21st goal with a 35-metre strike after only six minutes. Porto created very few chances, their only meaningful shot being a free kick that went wide of Edwin van der Sar's goal in the first half and later a chance for Lisandro L√≥pez. United played the game at a controlled pace, but they were unable to score a second goal to settle the nerves ‚Äì the threat remained that if Porto scored late, United would be knocked out. Ronaldo had a shot saved by the Porto goalkeeper Helton and Vidiƒá missed from a couple of yards. They held on to become the first English team to win at Porto and keep their ambition of winning five trophies in the same season alive. It was United's first clean sheet in six matches and set up a semi-final with fellow English team Arsenal. Chelsea won 7‚Äì5 on aggregate. \\\\---- Barcelona won 5‚Äì1 on aggregate. \\\\---- Arsenal won 4‚Äì1 on aggregate. \\\\---- Manchester United won 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. ==Semi-finals== The draw for the semi-finals took place immediately after the draw for the quarter-finals. The first legs were played on 28/29 April and the second legs on 5/6 May. } ===First leg=== \\\\---- ===Second leg=== Although Chelsea had achieved a goalless draw at the Camp Nou, Barcelona went into the game as favourites. The game started well for Chelsea and after nine minutes Michael Essien scored a 20-yard left-footed volley after Barcelona failed to clear a pass into the box from Frank Lampard. The first half came to a close with Chelsea leading 1‚Äì0. Despite Barcelona dominating possession, Chelsea continued to be the most dangerous side, especially following the sending off of Eric Abidal following a foul on Nicolas Anelka, with Chelsea also calling for up to four penalties, none of them being awarded by Norwegian referee Tom Henning √òvreb√∏. A 93rd-minute equaliser from a shot by Andr√©s Iniesta ‚Äì which happened to be Barcelona's only shot on target ‚Äì allowed Barcelona to ensure a last-minute qualification to the final. An additional handball in the box from Eto'o from a Ballack shot was also waived away. Almost as soon as referee √òvreb√∏ blew the final whistle, several Chelsea players surrounded him with complaints regarding his decisions. Some players, like Frank Lampard and Iniesta, swapped shirts, while others, such as Michael Ballack, John Terry, and Didier Drogba, continued to shout at the referee and contest him, with Drogba notably shouting, \\"It's a fucking disgrace\\" into a live television camera.

City and County of San Francisco, 113 U.S. 679 (1885), was an appeal from a decree that dismissed a bill filed by the appellant to restrain the infringement by the appellees of reissued letters patent granted to the appellant as the assignee of original letters patent issued to Thomas H. Bailey. The original patent was dated February 9, 1864, and the reissue September 18, 1877. They were for \\"a new and improved valve for water cylinders of steam fire engines and other pump cylinders.\\" The specification, which was substantially the same in both patents, stated that previous to the invention therein described, the only valve used to relieve the pressure upon fire hose to prevent them from bursting was one operated by hand. To obviate the defects of such a valve, the inventor applied at some point between the engine or pump and the hose nozzle a valve which opened automatically by the pressure in the hose or the pump cylinder, so as to discharge an additional stream and thereby relieve the pressure.. ==Background== The reissued patent contains two claims, the second of which only is found in the original. They were as follows: #The combination, with a pump cylinder and hose of a fire engine, of an automatic relief valve arranged relatively thereto substantially as specified. #The combination of the value C, stem d', spring E, adjustable cap D, and pin-hole d whereby the valve may be either held upon its seat with a variable yielding pressure or may be elevated therefrom or held immovably thereon, as an ordinary screw plug. #The answer of the defendants denied infringement, denied that Bailey was the original inventor of the devices described in his patent, and averred that his alleged invention had been in notorious public use many years before the application of a patent therefor by Bailey. The appellant did not contend that the appellees infringe the first claim of the reissued patent. He based his demand for relief on the alleged infringement of the second claim only. The proper construction of this claim was that it covered an automatic valve in combination with a contrivance consisting of a pinhole and pin, by which the valve may be raised from its seat, so as to leave the valve hole permanently open, or by which the valve may be rigidly closed upon its seat, making a closed or plug valve. The evidence showed that Bailey was not the first to conceive the idea of a device for opening or closing rigidly an automatic valve. The same thing had been done by means of wedges and screws and other devices. He cannot therefore cover by his patent all the devices for producing this result, no matter what their form or mode of operation. The claim must be confined to the specific device described in the specification and claim‚Äînamely a pinhole and pin. If this construction of the claim be adopted, it is clear that no infringement is shown, for the appellees do not use a pinhole and pin for holding their valve open or closed, but a screw, sleeve, or cap, and therefore one of the elements of the combination, covered by the second claim of appellant's patent, is wanting in the device used by the appellees. But if it be contended that the device covered by the second claim of the appellant's patent is infringed simply by the use of an automatic relief valve which can be converted at will into an open or closed valve, the evidence in the record is abundant. ==Decision== Upon this state of facts, it was plain that the mere employment by the defendants of the old and well known automatic safety valve afforded no ground upon which to base the relief prayed for in the appellant's bill. Appellant's counsel therefore disclaimed any right to the exclusive use of an automatic safety valve, and said: \\"We do not claim the valve any further than in this combination with a steam fire engine.\\" If it be conceded, therefore, that the second claim of appellant's patent covered the use of an automatic relief valve applied to a steam fire engine and hose, the question is presented whether the appellant's patent thus construed is valid. Justice Horace Gray speaking for the court; The decree of the circuit court was affirmed. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 ==References * Category:United States patent case law Category:Legal history of San Francisco Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:1885 in United States case law Category:1885 in California ","title":"Blake v.

Madhu Tea Estate was named after Madhu Chandra Roy. Before that the place was known as Patabari. ===Closed=== As of 2019, as per an official release of the Press Information Bureau, Government of India, Madhu Tea Estate, with 947 affected workers, was closed. The release said, \\"11 tea gardens are closed in the country. The main reasons for closure of these gardens are attributed to poor yield of the estates, ageing bush profile and high vacancy percentage in tea area, negligible uprooting / replanting of age old tea bushes for years, poor garden management practices, falling quality and price realizations, overall lack of development perspective, highly debt oriented funding strategy and ownership disputes.\\" Other tea estates in West Bengal listed as closed were: Dheklapara, Bundapani, Dharanipur, Redbank, Surendranagar, Panighata and Manabarrie. ===Geography=Area overview=== Alipurduar district is covered by two maps. It is an extensive area in the eastern end of the Dooars in West Bengal.

He invented a numbering machine, which in 1809 he unsuccessfully offered to the bank of Newry for numbering their banknotes. In 1812 the machine was adopted by the Bank of Ireland, and he received the appointment of engineer and chief engraver. In 1837 Oldham entered the service of the Bank of England, where he introduced improvements in the machinery for printing and numbering banknotes. This machinery continued in use until 1852‚Äì3, when the system of surface-printing was adopted. He died at his house in Montagu Street, Russell Square, London, on 14 February 1840. ==Engineer== Oldham also paid attention to marine propulsion, and in 1817 he obtained a patent (No. 4169) for propelling ships by means of paddles worked by a steam-engine, an attempt to imitate the motion of a paddle when used by a human. In 1820 he patented a further improvement (No. 4249), the paddles being placed on a shaft across the ship, and caused to revolve, being feathered by an adaptation of the gearing used in the former patent. It was used in the Aaron Manby, the first seagoing iron ship. A further development of the idea resulted in the construction of a feathering paddle-wheel, which was patented in 1827 (No. 5455). Oldham's system of warming buildings, introduced into the Bank of Ireland, and subsequently into the Bank of England, was described in the Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal, 1839, p. 96. ==Family== Oldham left a family of 17 children. His eldest son, Thomas Oldham (1801‚Äì1851), succeeded to his father's place at the bank. He was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 2 March 1841, and in 1842 he read a paper \\"On the Introduction of Letterpress Printing for numbering and dating the Notes of the Bank of England\\" (Proceedings, 1842, p. 166), and in the following year he contributed \\"A Description of the Automatic Balance at the Bank of England invented by W. Cotton\\" (Proceedings, 1843, p. 121). For the latter he received a Telford medal.

Citing Commissioners may cite Players for an act(s) of foul play where such act(s) may have been detected by the referee or assistant referee and which may have been the subject of referee action. A Citing Commissioner may not cite a Player for an act(s) of Foul Play in respect of which the Player has been Ordered Off save where the Ordering Off is as a result of two yellow cards. A Player in that situation may also be cited for the act(s) of Foul Play which resulted in either or both yellow card(s). Citing Commissioners may cite a Player if he has been Temporarily Suspended (Yellow card). Such citing may be made in respect of the incident(s) for which the Player was Temporarily Suspended or otherwise. A citing complaint by a Citing Commissioner must be sent in writing to the nominated officer of the Host Union or Tournament Organiser responsible for the Match in which the incident that is the subject of the citing complaint occurred within ordinarily a minimum of 12 hours and no later than a maximum of 48 hours of the conclusion of the Match. Teams may bring offences to the attention of the citing commissioner for review. The citing commissioner may cite a player even if the referee has already dealt with the issue (except where the player has been Ordered Off).

E. Marsh for suburban passenger service on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. ==History== After introducing two unsuccessful designs of 4-4-2 tank locomotive with the I1 and I2 classes, Douglas Earle Marsh learned a lesson and provided a new design with a far larger firebox. The new design was a tank version of Robert Billinton's successful B4 class tender locomotives. At the time of its introduction locomotive engineers were beginning to take an interest in superheating and Marsh therefore ordered two locomotives from Brighton Works for comparative purposes, one with a traditional saturated boiler and one incorporating the Schmidt superheater. These were built in October 1907 and March 1908 respectively. Several months of trials proved that both locomotives were performing well and reliably but the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Board of Directors were still not convinced that the extra building costs associated with superheating was matched by lower running costs. Marsh therefore built four more superheated locomotives and six without superheating, between February 1909 and March 1910. By mid 1910 there was sufficient operating data to convince the Directors and all after this date were superheated. Five more locomotives appeared in 1910. Both varieties of the I3 class proved themselves to be excellent locomotives but the superheated versions were significantly cheaper to run on express trains, especially when compared with the B4 and H1 classes.Bradley, (1974). p.90 The class were also used experimentally on through express trains with the London and North Western Railway between Brighton and Rugby and convinced the LNWR directors of the value of superheating.Bradley, (1974). p.92 Ten more superheated I3s were constructed in 1912 under Lawson Billinton, with minor detail differences. After World War I Billinton wished to convert the remaining members of the class to superheating as their boilers came due for renewal, but only the prototype No. 21 was converted before the LB&SCR; merged with other railways to form Southern Railway in January 1923. The remainder were converted by Richard Maunsell between 1925 and 1927 using his own design of superheater. During 1925 and 1926 the I3 class were gradually replaced on the London- Brighton express trains by the \\"King Arthur\\" and \\"River\\" classes, and they were transferred on to semi-fast and other secondary services. However, the electrification of the London to Brighton and London to Portsmouth lines during the 1930s meant that the class were transferred further afield on the Southern Railway including Salisbury and Dover. Between the Autumn of 1941 and the summer of 1943 two I3 locomotives were loaned to the Great Western Railway and performed well on services from Gloucester, and Worcester. ==Accidents and incidents== *On 21 January 1947, locomotive No. 2028 was hauling an empty stock train which was in a rear-end collision with an electric multiple unit at , London. ==Withdrawals== The first worn-out member of the class was withdrawn by the Southern Railway in 1944, but the remainder survived into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948, although all were withdrawn between January 1950 and May 1952, having all completed very high mileages. No example has been preserved. ==Numbering== The first ten were numbered 21-30 and the remainder 75-91. The Southern Railway initially added a \\"B\\" prefix to these numbers and later renumbered them 2021-2030 and 2075-2091.

The Temmler Group is a German pharmaceutical company, which focuses on the production, sale and contract production of pharmaceutical products. In 2012 the Temmler Group was taken over by the Aenova Group and with its seven production sites is one of the largest European pharmaceutical contract manufacturers. ==History== Temmler Pervitin, tablet container; the methamphetamine brand used by German soldiers during World War II. The Temmler-Werke was founded in Detmold in 1917 by Hermann Temmler. In 1919 it merged with the Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken GmbH in Detmold to form the Vereinigten Chemischen Fabriken H. Temmler pharmaceutical company. 1925 its headquarters was re-located to Berlin. Preparations for the treatment and alleviation of respiratory diseases became the hallmark of Temmler Pharma. Temmler plant in Berlin-Johannisthal, production building (2015) From 1933, the company, with expanded production facilities, concentrated its business activities exclusively around the Berlin area. In 1938, a Temmler chemist in Berlin synthesised Pervitin (methamphetamine-hydrochloride), the pharmaceutical drug was then manufactured and dispensed over-the-counter to the public as a central nervous system and circulatory system analeptic, psychiatric performance enhancing stimulant and to induce or extend wakefulness to treat narcolepsy.Robert N. Proctor: The Nazi War on Cancer , Princeton University Press, 2000. p. 154-155 Pervitin was made available and packaged in thirty tablet oral dosage form, and in six 1ccm glass ampulla form as an intramuscular or intravenous injectable. The company became especially known for the introduction of its methamphetamine-hydrochloride preparation brand Pervitin, which the company produced from 1938 up until 1988. According to a Der Spiegel article in 2005, Nazi Germany believed that Pervitin could also help win World War II, so the German armed forces was supplied with more than 38 million Pervitin tablets, especially during Germany's \\"Blitzkrieg\\" invasion of Poland and the Battle of France during 1939/40 where it was introduced to soldiers to attenuate anxiety and increase performance and concentration. In 1945 the facility in East Berlin was occupied and disassembled. The company had to be completely reassembled in Hamburg. In 1960 the whole company transferred from Hamburg to Marburg. The Hessian state government awarded the complex, an area of about 40,000 m¬≤ of production and administration facilities, a prize for functional and architectural design. In 1967 the production and storage facilities were extended. In 1971 a new laboratory building was erected for the manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms and active ingredients for controlled release. It became possible, for example, to produce medicinal products in the form of retard pellets releasing their active ingredients when required and over a longer period of time. In 1982, these retard preparations marked the beginning of contract manufacturing, initially for foreign firms only. Commencing 1989 the production also comprised all solid pharmaceutical dosage forms for customers at home and abroad. In 1990 Temmler Pharma became part of the ASTA Medica group. Besides medicinal products for gastroenterology and migraine/pain, pulmology become the focal point of the preparations programme. In 1998 Temmler Pharma took over 17 established products, thus extending its product range to include pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. Since 1999 Temmler Pharma is once again in private hands. In 2004 the laboratory building was extended by adding two additional floors to 2,500 m¬≤, thus laying the foundation for further growth in the field of pharmaceutical development and contract manufacturing services. A complex comprising 1,380 m¬≤ housing production facilities to meet future GMP and FDA standards was erected in 2005. Solid pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, and particularly retard formulations, are manufactured at this site. 2007 The acquisition of three European production sites (Germany, Ireland, Italy) from the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas on January 1 led to the formation of the Temmler Group, considerably extending production capacities and technological possibilities. The Temmler Group acquires two further production sites in Feldkirchen and Bruckm√ºhl. 2008 With the acquisition of the SwissCo group, based in Sisseln, Switzerland, the Temmler group further develops its competence in the processing of moisture sensitive active substances. The production of effervescent tablets is the chief work of SwissCo. Today Temmler is one of the leading contract manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry. 2012 Temmler's production facility acquired by Aenova and Temmler's neurology products with the commercial infrastructure and pipeline acquired by major pharma Lupin Limited. == References  * Official website http://www.temmler.eu * Temmler factory, Berlin: image gallery, demolished in autumn 2015 == See also == * Methamphetamine Category:Chemical companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Hesse Category:Multinational companies Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Germany Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1917 Category:Medical and health organisations based in Hesse ","title":"Temmler"},{"id":"20407495","text":"Newport Crown Court Newport Crown Court is a Crown Court venue in the city of Newport, South Wales.

It is found in China, Japan, South-east Asia, India, eastern Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific islands. It is one of the major pests of maize in Asia. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1865. ==Etymology== They term \\"armyworm\\" is used because of their habit to spread out in a line across a lawn or pasture, and slowly \\"march\\" forward, consuming the foliage they encounter. Caterpillar Plant volatiles released by corn plants may help the caterpillar avoid predators. ==Description== The wingspan is 35‚Äì50 mm. Males lack paired tufts on the basal segment of the abdomen below. The forewings are greyish yellow with a dark-grey or reddish-yellow tinge. The round and reniform spots are light or yellowish with indistinct edges, whereas reniform spot with white point at lower margin. External wing margin blackened obliquely from top backward, with dark stroke and with a row of dark points. Hindwings are grey, with dark external margin. Antennae thread like. Eggs are spherical and milky white with a thinly reticulate surface. Larvae usually have six instars, rarely seven. It reaching 40 mm in length at its last instar. Larva has two wide black-brown and one intermediate light dorsal stripe, with black-brown lateral stripe along spiracle line. spiracles brown with black rim. Pupae are yellowish brown and shiny. ==Ecology== The moth flies from January to April depending on the location. The larvae feed on a range of agricultural plants like Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Oryza sativa and are thus considered a pest. Caterpillars do not feed on Momordica charantia due to the presence of the triterpenoid glucoside called momordicine II, which is a natural inhibitor of caterpillar actions. ==Infestations== China experiences periodic outbreaks of northern armyworm infestation.Wang GP, et al. The role of nectar plants in severe outbreaks of armyworm Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in China. Bulletin of Entomological Research 2006 October 96 (5):445-55. The outbreak in 2012 was particularly severe.Staff, ChinaDaily. 14 August 2012. \\"China warns of armyworm outbreak\\" ==Control== Larva can be hand picked and adults can attracted using pheromones. Regulation of water level in the fields, and removal of alternate hosts from the field are also effective. Among biological controls, ducks are good; they can locate larvae hiding in the soil or at the base of plants easily and prey on them. Introduction of Cotesia ruficrus, and Eupteromalus parnarae also parasitized the larva. Selective pesticides and weedicides can also used in the field.

It was recommended as one of the ten best books of 1995 by the American Library Association. ==Plot summary== Cliff is eleven years old and the oldest of six children in his family who live in Ballingsford. As Christmas nears, Cliff's grandmother arrives for a visit. Cliff's baby brother is rushed to the hospital with a severe illness. While he is recovering in the hospital on Christmas Eve, his family finally figure out that the \\"yidda yadda\\" he has been asking Santa Claus for is a little ladder like the one used to climb up to the top of a bunk bed. The entire family work together to build Josh a ladder and deliver it on Christmas morning. Later, Cliff's first grade brother, Brad, drives his bicycle into an ambulance and dies in the hospital while his family comes to see him. His mother is heart broken when she is told that Brad could not be saved. Brad was buried in his favorite soccer shirt that his mother found and washed and had been crying on. As Brad was being buried, Cliff realized that Brad was gone forever. The family spends the next Christmas at a resort trying to adjust to the loss of Brad but the trip does not seem to work. Their spirits rise during a New Year's party at Aunt Pat's house. When they arrive at the party, Josh accidentally steps into Dad's special fig pudding that they were bringing. Dad removes the shoe, smooths down the pudding, and swears the children to secrecy. They all keep a straight face until Uncle Eddie says that the fig pudding is the best ever and asks Dad if he has added some new ingredient. They all laugh when the real story of the shoe is told. ==Style== Fig Pudding is written using an episodic plot style. ==Reception== Chris Sherman in his review for Booklist said that \\"Fletcher captures perfectly the humor, irritations, and sadness of life in a large, close-knit family and makes Cliff a sympathetic and thoughtful narrator, occasionally bewildered by his siblings' antics but always a completely believable older brother.

Born in Floriana on 7 April 1906 on the island of Malta, Ganado studied at the Lyceum and University of Malta and graduated as a lawyer in 1931. He was active at university, being President of the University Students' Council (KSU), and shortly after became president of the lay movement, Catholic Action. In 1933 he was appointed the third editor of the newspaper Lehen is-Sewwa, the voice of Catholic Action. Ganado succeeded in steering the paper through turbulent times preceding the Second World War, and not only converted Lehen is-Sewwa into a daily paper, but also gave it a new look. He widened its scope by covering a wider range of subjects and made it a means for the promotion and dissemination of Catholic culture with a broad view on all religious, social, cultural and even political spheres of Maltese society set within a global context. During the Spanish Civil War Ganado wrote several articles in support of Francisco Franco. In 1939 he was interned without trial by the British colonial authorities for his suspected sympathy with the Italian government of Benito Mussolini and the Italian fascists. He was subsequently exiled with a number of Maltese nationals to Uganda.Carmel Farrugia, Polluted Politics 1933‚Äì1942, Background to the Deportations of Maltese Nationals in 1942 (Midsea Books Ltd: 1995). Ganado later remarked that a positive aspect of the war was showing the importance of women and directly led to universal suffrage in Malta in 1947, followed by women being allowed to stand for public office. After the war he was released, and led a splinter group from the Nationalist Party to form the Democratic Nationalist Party (Partit Demokratiku Nazzjonalista). However, this was short lived and ultimately unsuccessful in political terms. He married Alda n√©e Randon and they had five children together, one of whom died shortly after his birth. One of his close friends since his days at university in the 1920s was the Maltese lawyer, Joseph Flores. However, Flores became a member of the Malta Labour Party (MLP) under the leadership of Dom Mintoff in the 1950s at the time when Ganado was openly opposed to Mintoff's policy of Integration with Britain. Flores, eventually resigned from the MLP and was made a judge. His best known literary work is his 4 volume memoirs, Rajt Malta Tinbidel.Herbert Ganado, Rajt Malta Tinbidel, 4 Volumi(1977) This work was translated into the English language by another well known Maltese lawyer politician Dr. Michael A. Refalo and titled \\"My Century\\". Herbert Ganado Gardens in Floriana are named after him. He died on 8 April 1979, a day after his 73rd birthday, and was interred at Santa Maria Addolorata cemetery. ==See also== *Carmelo Borg Pisani *List of Malta-related topics ==References== Category:Leaders of political parties in Malta Category:Alumni of the University of Malta Category:1906 births Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT politicians from Malta Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Floriana Category:20th-century Maltese politicians ","title":"Herbert Ganado"},{"id":"20407733","text":"Mythimna convecta, the common or Australian armyworm, is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

While the report's recommendations were not fully accepted by the Hawke government, they led to significant changes in Australia's defence policy, including adoption of the Defence of Australia Policy. ==Background== In February 1985, Minister for Defence Kim Beazley commissioned Paul Dibb, an external consultant and former employee of the Department of Defence, to analyse Australia's defence planning and make recommendations for future developments. ==Synopsis== Dibb's report was published in March 1986 and recommended for Australia to abandon the remaining elements of the forward defence policy but concentrate its military resources on the geographic areas relevant to defending the country and its economic interests from direct attack. Dibb's recommendations were based around an assessment that \\"Australia is one of the most secure countries on earth\\" and that while there was the potential for regional conflict, the longer-term intentions and capabilities of countries in Australia's region could not be predicted and so did not form a suitable basis for planning. Dibb recommended for Australia's military posture to be based on a strategy of denying aggressors the ability to attack the country. That was to be achieved through using a layered defence of Jindalee Operational Radar Network (over- the-horizon radar), patrol aircraft and maritime strike aircraft to protect Australia's approaches with the Army's Operational Deployment Force being responsible for defeating any landings on the Australian mainland. That would require changes to the Australian Defence Force's structure and equipment acquisition programs. The policy of self-reliance proposed by Dibb also placed less emphasis on ANZUS, its alliance with the United States, than previous policies. ==Reception== The Dibb Report received a mixed response. Some experts regarded it as being an important contribution to developing an independent Australian defence posture. Other experts criticised the report for calling for an essentially defensive military strategy, implying that existing Australian military capabilities be abandoned and making optimistic assumptions about the period of time available to detect and respond to new threats to Australia. Many of the Dibb Report's assumptions were used in developing the 1987 Defence White Paper, but the Government did not adopt some of Dibb's key recommendations, such as those concerning Australia's relationship with the United States and the Australian military's role in the Pacific. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * (25 Mb file, individual sections available here) Category:Australian defence policies ","title":"Dibb Report"},{"id":"20407797","text":"Ivan Gazidis (born 13 September 1964) is the Executive of Italian Serie A club AC Milan.

He spent the first half of his life‚Äîapart from war service‚Äîbased in Kent and London, being the proprietor of a series of bookshops, editing the influential literary magazine Nine and being part of the literary scene. Bankruptcy and divorce led to several years of travel which took him to Berlin, Venice, British Columbia and Iran, amongst other places. After the Iranian Revolution he settled permanently in Italy, where he spent the rest of his life. He lived in considerable financial hardship and throughout all he lived a life dedicated to poetry. His work never became mainstream, but it is highly regarded in some circles. ==Biography== Russell was born in Bristol and educated at Malvern College. During World War II he served in the Royal Artillery as an intelligence officer in India and Burma, he left the army with the rank of major. After the war, he studied English at Queen Mary College, London. He left without taking a degree. In 1948 Russell set up an \\"Ezra Pound Circle' which met once a fortnight in a London pub. Arthur V. Moore encouraged him, passing on advice from Pound: \\"E.P. thinks you might do as he used to half a century ago ... arrange to be at a given eating place at a given hour each week ... It must be cheap enough so anyone can afford it, and at a place where such a gathering would be made comfortable.\\"Carpenter, p.786 That summer Russell went to Italy and met Olga Rudge at Siena, met Pound's friend John Drummond in Rome, and visited Rapallo where he met D. D. Paige who was staying in Pound's old flat engaged in the arduous task of compiling the first selection of Pound's letters.Carpenter, p.786 In 1951 Russell married Marjorie Keeling-Bloxam. Her brother-in-law was Albion Harman, son of the self-proclaimed king of Lundy, the largest island in the Bristol Channel. In the 1950s Russell often visited Lundy, and enjoyed bird-watching there.Burns, 'The Poet Odyssified' In 1949 Russell founded the literary magazine Nine (named after the Nine Muses) which in its eleven issues published many notable poets including George Barker, Basil Bunting, Roy Campbell, Ronald Duncan, Paul Eluard, William Empson, David Gascoyne, Robert Graves, Michael Hamburger. The following year he started The Pound Press. Russell published work by Pound's friends, An Examination of Ezra Pound (1950), but also the first English translations of Mandelstam, Pasternak and Borges. Russell ran the Grosvenor Bookshop in Tunbridge Wells from 1951 to 1959. Both Nine and the Pound Press ceased operation in 1956, and later that year Russell met the young William Cookson and in 1958 introduced him to Krystyna and Czes≈Çaw Bednarczyk of The Poets' and Painters' PressCookson, editorial to Agenda Vol 32 Nos. 3 ‚Äì 4. and suggested that Cookson found his own journal, which was to be the long-running Agenda. Russell introduced him to the works of Hugh McDiarmid and Tom Scott. Cookson saw Agenda as in part a continuation of what Russell had done with Nine.Cookson, in Alexander, p. 46 In 1995 Agenda brought out one of its dedicated issues: 'A Tribute to Peter Russell'. In 1959 the Grosvenor Bookshop went out of business, and he opened the Gallery Bookshop in Soho, London. He finally went bankrupt in 1963 and with the collapse of his marriage, he moved to Berlin. In 1965 he relocated to Venice. He had rooms in the Campo de la Bragola. In the mid 1970s he held a writing fellowship as poet in residence at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, where he met his second wife, Lana Sue Long, who was around 30 years his junior. Two daughters, Kathleen and Sara, were born to the couple in 1975 and 1976. After leaving Canada, the family moved to Tehran, where Russell taught and studied at the Imperial Academy of Philosophy. Their third child, a son, Peter George, was born there in 1977. They remained in Iran until the 1979 revolution, when they returned to Italy, where they lived together under considerable financial hardship. In 1989 Lana returned with the three children to North America, settling in Jackpot, Nevada, and the couple divorced in the 1990s. Tuscany was Russell's home for the last forty years of his life. In 1983 he moved into an old mill ‚Äî \\"La Turbina\\" ‚Äî in Pian di Sc√≤, in the Valdarno near Arezzo. Life at the mill was rudimentary, and there was hardly any furniture, although there were thousands of books in a variety of languages, and a supply of whisky and cigarettes. Russell essentially lived in the kitchen, the most habitable and only warm room of the house.Pursglove, Obituary in Acumen 46 From 1990 he began editing the Marginalia Newsletter, which appeared alternately in English (odd numbered issues) and Italian (even numbered issues). In the early 1990s he began working with his son, now a teenager, on the translations in his bilingual collections of his poems. In April 2001 serious health problems associated with a gastric ulcer led to three months in hospital, followed by a further three months in a sanatorium for the elderly. Around this time he became effectively completely blind.Preface to Living Death Russell translated varied works from several European languages, he also worked in Persian and Arabic; he was the first English translator of Osip Mandelstam. His close friends included Kathleen Raine and Leonello Rabatti. He was a cousin of Bertrand RussellBBC Bristol, 23 January 2003 He died in the hospital at San Giovanni Valdarno, only 15 minutes or so by car from Pian di Sc√≤. ==Work== Dana Gioia has described Russell as \\"a poet of striking contradictions. He is an immensely learned writer with an anti-academic temperament, a Modernist bewitched by classicism, a polyglot rooted in demotic English, an experimentalist in love with strict traditional forms, a natural democrat suspicious of the Left, and a mystic committed to clarity.\\"Poetry Salzburg Review, No. 4, Spring 2003.

Buckland, then known as Bocheland, was one of the three settlements on Portsea Island mentioned in the Domesday Book. The Manor of Bocheland was purchased by Jean de Gisors. De Gisors, a Norman lord who then founded Portsmouth on land at the southern end of the manor, in 1180. The area was extensively bombed during the Second World War. Due to this, and the slum nature of much of what housing was left, large parts were demolished and replaced with social housing built in the 1950s and '60s. Buckland has their own language barrier of rhyme and slang just like London back in the early 60s. Charles Dickens was born in Buckland in 1812. His father moved to Portsmouth to work at the Naval Base. He bought a terraced house in an area close to the base then called Newtown. The house of his birth is now a museum. It stands in Old Commercial Road which is to this day a very prestigious street containing many listed Georgian and Victorian terraced houses and town houses. There is no official boundary of Buckland, but the locals usually define it as Kingston Crescent (A2047 westbound) to the north, Kingston Road (A2047 southbound) to the east, Lake Road to the south and Mile End Road to the west. Barkis and Nickelby houses are the most prominent buildings in the neighbourhood standing 17 stories high. Pickwick and Copperfield houses are another set of tower blocks which are 11 stories high. Blackwood and Brisbane houses are mid rise \\"groundscraper\\" blocks at 6 stories high located near the busy M275 Mile End Road. All mentioned houses have been used and to some degree still are used as social housing by Portsmouth City Council (exact status unknown). Buckland is now a mixture of terraced houses, modern 2 floor houses, modern two floor per flat - overlapped flats and the infamous houses that are spread at the southwest corner of Buckland. Population density is high, although the houses or flats are quite small in size and lack comfort most of them are in a decent state. Flying Bull Primary and Nursery School serves the Buckland area.

It shows an example of a very hostile interpretation of exclusion clauses. ==Facts== Walter Hollier took his Rambler car to an automobile repair shop, Rambler Motors. He had been to this garage on three or four occasions in the past five years before, and he had usually signed an invoice which said the > \\"company is not responsible for damage caused by fire to customers‚Äô cars on > the premises.\\" He did not sign the form on this occasion. Unfortunately, some wiring in the garage was faulty. Rambler Motors had negligently failed to inspect or maintain the wiring in the shop. A fire broke out and burnt down the garage, with Hollier's car in it. Hollier sued Rambler Motors for the cost of his car. ==Judgment== The Court of Appeal held that a previous course of dealing did not incorporate the term, because there was neither a regular nor consistent course of dealings. It went on to ask what would have happened were it incorporated, and held that the exclusion clause would still not have been effective to save Rambler Motors Ltd for liability, because it should be construed against the person relying on it (contra proferentum) and this clause covered more than negligence. A reasonable person would think liability for other things beyond the garage's own control would be excluded, but not the garage's own fault. Salmon LJ observed the following: He refers to Scrutton LJ in Rutter v Palmer [1922] 2 KB 87 saying a clear clause excluding negligence liability \\"will more readily operate to exempt him.\\" Also, in Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd [1945] KB 189, Lord Greene MR was not seeking to extend the law, and here was quite different, because the reasonable person would see a number of other causes of fire. It would surprise an ordinary person if it applied to a fire caused by the garage‚Äôs own negligence (rather than an external cause). If they wanted to make exclusions for their own negligence 'they ought to have done so in far plainer language'. ==Significance== The case \\"illustrates the courts' reluctance to permit the exclusion of liability of negligence.\\" The court also held that \\"a customer could understand the clause to mean that the defendants were not liable for a fire caused without their negligence.\\" The court also held that three or four transactions over a five year period were not enough to incorporate an exemption clause into the consumer contract. ==See also== *English contract law *Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King [1952] AC 192 *Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827 ==Notes== Category:English contract case law Category:English interpretation case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1971 in case law Category:1971 in British law Category:American Motors Category:1971 fires Category:Automotive repair shops ","title":"Hollier v Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd"},{"id":"20408099","text":"Aisquith Farm E Archeological Site is an archaeological site near Riva in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

In addition, the Hjalmar Peterson Orchestra recorded 18 instrumental tracks for Victor. Some of the Victor numbers were subsequently released on the company's low-priced Bluebird label.Swedish music on the Bluebird label archive.org. Retrieved: March 23, 2018. Columbia and Victor always listed Olle under both his real name and his stage name. Some records gave Hjalmar Peterson top billing. Others gave precedence to Olle i Skratthult. Instrumentals were credited to Olle i Skratthults Luffarekapell, Hjalmar Peterson's Hobo Orchestra and to other similar names. Olle's band did not appear on the records, which were made by studio musicians in New York and Chicago. Among the session players were country music singer Carson Robison on guitar and Arvid Franzen on accordion. Ted Johnson, a onetime musician in Olle's company, became a bandleader in the 1930s and made several recordings with his own group. Johnson was, incidentally, the pipe-smoking fiddler in the memorable 1926 photo of the Hobo Orchestra. As a performer Olle relied on many Swedish songwriters and poets.Swedish songwriters and poets archive.org. Retrieved: Mar. 14, 2019. The most important of these were Lars Bondeson, F. A. Dahlgren, Gustaf Fr√∂ding, David Hellstr√∂m, Jeremias i Tr√∂stl√∂sa, J√∂dde i G√∂ljaryd, Sk√•nska Lasse, Anna Myrberg, Emil Norlander, Kalle N√§mdeman, Ernst Rolf, G√∂ran Svenning and Fred Winter.Ethnic music on records: a discography of ethnic recordings produced in the United States, 1893-1942 by Richard K. Spottswood, (University of Illinois Press, 1990) LCCN 89-020526. Volume 5, pp. 2728-2733. Best known for his comedy, Olle also had romantic waltzes in his repertoire. He recorded, for instance, Malm√∂ valsen (The Malm√∂ waltz), written by Svenning and Hellstr√∂m for the Baltic Exhibition of 1914.P√• n√∂jets estrader by Uno Myggan Ericson, (Stockholm: Bonnier, 1971) p. 165. A contemporary recording artist, who had much in common with Olle, was Charles G. Widd√©n. The classically trained singer Joel Mossberg took much of his repertoire from the Swedish choral tradition, but he and Olle each recorded several comic songs written by Lars Bondeson. Not all of Olle's songs had Swedish roots. Den lustige kopparslagarn (The jolly coppersmith), which Olle recorded three times, was of German origin. Barndomshemmet (My childhood home), which his wife Olga performed, was an adaptation of On the banks of the Wabash, the state song of Indiana. There were other examples of American popular music in Olle's repertoire. Just kiss yourself good-bye in Swedish became Petters olycksaliga frieri (Peter's unlucky marriage proposal). I'm forever blowing bubbles was likewise S√•pbubblor (Soap bubbles). Just kiss yourself good-bye was a so-called Coon song, but its racial stereotypes were absent from the Swedish version. Some of Olle's final recordings were taken from more traditional sources. In 1928 he recorded the folk song Jag gick mig ut en sommerdag (I went out one summer day). The next year he recorded the broadside ballad Hjalmar och Hulda (Hjalmar and Hulda). These sorrowful tales were a departure from his usual lighthearted fare. In addition to his records Olle i Skratthult published and sold several songbooks. The small pamphlets included songs he had recorded and other material from his live performances.Songbook indexes archive.org. Retrieved: Oct. 21, 2019. His 1921 and 1922 songbooks are on file at the Minnesota Historical Society. Olle i Skratthult will be forever associated with the song Nikolina. He recorded it in 1917 for Columbia and in 1923 and 1929 for Victor. It is estimated that 100,000 copies of the song were sold, a remarkable feat for a foreign-language record. Nikolina is the tragicomic story of a couple, whose desire for romantic happiness is thwarted by the girl's autocratic father. The song had a great appeal for immigrant audiences, who strongly identified with the young lovers' plight. An English version, recorded by Slim Jim and the Vagabond Kid (Ernest and Clarence Iverson), introduced the song to the rest of America.\\"Nikolina\\" in three languages archive.org. Retrieved 04/26/18. ==Renewed interest in Olle i Skratthult== The Swedish Emigrant Institute In the 1970s Olle i Skratthult was rediscovered in his native country and in the United States. The Swedish Emigrant Institute of V√§xj√∂ gave prominent mention to Olle i Skratthult and Charles G. Widd√©n in a 1973 exhibit on entertainment in Swedish America. A small disc was produced for the occasion with excerpts from their songs and stories. The Snoose Boulevard Festival was held in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1972 through 1977. In the late 19th century Cedar Avenue became known as \\"Snoose Boulevard\\", a nickname often given to the main street in Scandinavian communities. The term derived from the residents' fondness for snus (snuff), an inexpensive form of tobacco. The event, which celebrated the area's Scandinavian past, featured the music, food, and arts of the immigrants who had once lived there. It also highlighted the careers of Olle i Skratthult (Hjalmar Peterson), Slim Jim and the Vagabond Kid (Ernest and Clarence Iverson) and the Olson Sisters (Eleonora and Ethel Olson). ==Reissues and other recordings== In conjunction with the festival the Swedish-born singer Anne-Charlotte Harvey recorded three albums of folk tunes, emigrant ballads, hymns, waltzes and comic songs. The non-profit Olle i Skratthult Project sponsored the annual celebration and the recordings.Seward Profile April 2005.Teater, Visafton och Bal by Anne-Charlotte Harvey and Richard H. Hulan, (Chicago: Swedish-American Historical Society, 1986) p. 126-141. Harvey's albums, produced by the renowned ethnomusicologist Maury Bernstein, included twelve songs from Olle's repertoire. In 1976 the Olle i Skratthult Project reissued two of Olle's most popular recordings as a single: Nikolina and Flickan P√• Bellmansro. Banjar Records, a label based in the Twin Cities, released one song by Olle and two by his Hobo Orchestra in 1983.Nikolina: early Scandinavian bands and entertainers (Minneapolis: Banjar Records, 1983). Olle's recordings were released in Sweden as well. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research had three of his songs on its album \\"From Sweden to America\\", which was released as an LP in 1981 and as a CD in 1996. Recorded in Sweden and the United States between 1917 and 1980, the collection had songs by Olle i Skratthult, Olga Lindgren, Gustav Fonandern, Lydia Hedberg, Ragnar Hasselgren and Anne-Charlotte Harvey.From Sweden to America (Stockholm: Caprice Records, 1996). In 2011 the twenty-three tracks on the CD were released on iTunes and Amazon mp3. Gustav Fonandern and Lydia Hedberg were Swedish performers, whose American tours of the 1920s were an important source of new material for the Swedish-American song repertoire. In 2016 the Minnesota Historical Society opened an online archive of Swedish American newspapers.

Olle's Hobo Orchestra not only provided one of the tunes but also appeared on the cover in a drawing by the artist.Gay life in Dikanka (Lund, Sweden: Bakh√•ll, 2000). ==Foreword to 1908 songbook== Swedes have had the reputation of familiarizing themselves faster than anyone else with the customs and traditions of various countries ‚Äî to take them in stride. About two years ago a happy and energetic young man came to this country from the province of V√§rmland. His name was Hjalmar Peterson, and he had already successfully appeared on stage in his home district under the name of \\"Olle i Skratthult\\". But little did he suspect that he would soon establish himself as America's foremost Swedish comedian, storyteller and singer. Like our great American actors and entertainers \\"Olle i Skratthult\\" now offers his songs and stories for sale, and it is to be hoped that this little book will do well since it contains many of the choice pieces with which \\"Olle\\" has had great success, written by such well-known Swedish humorists as Gustaf Fr√∂ding,Tall Tales and Adventures archive.org.

My brother, you know, he got a little sick. And so I took him to the doctor. The doctor he said there was something wrong with my brother's eye. So the doctor he took out my brother's eye and put it in a bowl that was sitting on the table. But then something awful happened. The doctor's big cat was in the room too, and she saw my brother's eye lying in that bowl. And the cat ‚Äî she went and swallowed up the eye of my brother. And I didn't want to say anything, of course, when the doctor didn't say anything. But no sooner had it happened than the doctor turned and saw the empty bowl. And then he said, Where has your brother's eye gone? And then I said, Well, and I laughed and said, the cat swallowed it. But then the doctor got furious and took the cat by the rump and threw her against the wall, and all at once she was as dead as a doornail. Then the doctor took out the cat's eye and put it in my brother, and he was fine and could see fine with the cat's eye. But one time a little later on I was on the front steps at home when the doctor came by. And he said, How's your brother doing? Oh, thank you, Mister Doctor, I said, everything's just fine. He sees real good with that cat's eye. But the worst thing is that now he watches the girls with the one eye, and he watches the rat holes with the other. : :First We Ate Up The Cow Well, the other day when I was out walking, I met my cousin Josef from Muck Meadow.

No, he said, I quit, he said. Really? You quit? I said. Yes, he said, I quit, he said. Oh, I said, but why did you quit? I said. Well, he said, the food got so bad, he said. Really, I said, the food got so bad? I said. Yes, he said, the food got so bad, he said, so I had to quit, he said. You see, he said, first the big cow died, he said, and then we had to eat her up, he said; and then all of a sudden the big sow died, and then we had to eat her up, he said.

Once he completed high school in 1952, he began to study medicine, psychology, philosophy, literature and art history at the University of G√∂ttingen. In addition he worked part- time as a student assistant in a laboratory, in various factories and building sites, as well as in mines and in the harbour. It has to be noted that Mike Rose started painting and writing well before he completed high school. His first exhibition took place in 1958 in Hamburg. In 1959 he worked as a freelance set designer in Bayreuth at the Bayreuth Festival, and later became a set designer in the city Bamberg. In order to be an independent individual as well as an artist, Mike Rose began to study education in 1965/1966, completing the two required state examination in 1966 and 1969. At first he taught as a primary teacher, and later, upon passing the second state exam, as a teacher in a special school with handicapped children. From 1974 to 1975 Mike Rose also participated in educating new teachers, as well as being a work experience teacher for work experience students in the field of social studies at the University of Bamberg (1975‚Äì1985). His work as a stage designer at the theatre of Bamberg continued until 1979. From 1971 ‚Äì 1972 Mike Rose was the second chairman of the German Federation of Artists in Upper-Franconia (Bundesverband Bildener K√ºnstler Oberfranken). In 1972 he became a member of the French artistic movement Lettrisme in Paris. In this new capacity he participated in their exhibitions until the 1980s. Mike Rose displayed abstract, written- and drawn- paintings, collages, objects and sculptures in approximately 200 exhibitions in the following cities: Berlin, Castrop-Rauxel, Frankfurt/Main, Kassel, Cologne, Munich, Nuremberg, Plauen, Nice, Paris, Strasburg, Bologna, Z√ºrich, Bern, Graz, Budapest, Boston, New York and San Francisco. Mike Rose's idea of \\"Communication-Art\\" led to the establishment of the didactic gallery \\"Studio M\\" in 1973. Here Mike Rose displayed a cross- section of all kinds of contemporary art until 1988. In addition he lectured at adult evening classes in Bamberg from 1972‚Äì1978. His occupation concerned itself with the education of adults in the field of fine arts, introduction to contemporary art, the construction of art classes for children and creative work with prisoners of the penal institution in Bamberg. He received fresh inspiration for his artistic and literary work through study trips to Italy, France, Spain and Greece. In 2003 he received the \\"Berganza-Preis\\" award from the art society of Bamberg (Kunstverein Bamberg). A tattoo to remember the Mike Rose After having lived in Gr√ºnenplan, Gehren, Ilmenau, Alfeld/Leine, G√∂ttingen, Hannover and Hamburg, Bamberg became his home. He was married a number of times and is the father of six children. Mike Rose's work was ended by serious diabetes and blood cancer which led to a leg amputation. Mike Rose died in 2006 and was buried in the cemetery of Bamberg. Several of Mike Rose's artworks are today in possession of, amongst others, the Bamberger Bank, Citibank, Sparkasse Bamberg, as well as the cities Bamberg, Castrop-Rauxel, Munich and Nuremberg. Works Mike Rose's work covers various artistic areas such as painting and literature. Mike Rose described himself as a \\"painter and poet\\".http://www.bbk-bayern.de/obf/artur/artur8.pdf Mike Rose's artistic paint work can be divided into the following 5 phases: * Work until 1964: The paintings from 1959‚Äì1964 begin representational and then become more abstract. The dealing with various materials was a major focus in these early works. Examples of this are several sand paintings from this period. Mike Rose used Sand, varnish paint, and oil paint squeezed out of the tube. However, paper, textiles and canvas of varying coarseness were also used. In 1964 came the transition from collages to ‚Äúscript paintings‚Äù. * 1964‚Äì1972: Collages such as the \\"Weltbildcollage\\" introduced script and writing as a structure into Mike Rose's work. This brought a focus on the written word, the single letter and character, and the reduction of written scripts. It was at this point that Mike Rose came in touch with the Parisian movement of Lettrisme. * 1972‚Äì1985, script paintings: The encounter with the Parisian group ‚ÄúLettriste‚Äù had a big impact on Mike Rose and left a lasting impression. After several ultra-graphic experiments, he developed the ‚ÄúZeichen im Zeichen‚Äù which translates as ‚Äúthe sign in the sign‚Äù. The ‚Äúsuper sign‚Äù is made up of many small signs (or characters) that are grouped together to transmit one message. As such Mike Rose created very strong motifs with black and red paint on rough canvas. The following ‚Äúbig-sign series‚Äù (Grosszeichen-serie) represents the reduction of the aforementioned ‚Äúsign in the sign‚Äù series. Eugen Gommringer noted the following about Mike Rose: ‚ÄúHe is today fully entitled to be described as ‚Äòthe German contribution to Lettrism‚Äô‚Äù. \\" Eugen Gomringer in: Mike Rose. Bamberg 1959‚Äì1979. Katalog zur Ausstellung in der . Mike Rose ‚Äì ein erster √úberblick √ºber sein Werk (o. S.) Hanau 1979. . (120 Abb.) * 1985‚Äì1995, Multidimensional Paintings: It was during a trip to Spain that it occurred to Mike Rose that real and imagined space could be expanded through reflection; by the use of mirrors for example. Through multiple reflections space can be expanded. Likewise Cubism showed new ways of thinking about space through the contraction of different perspectives. A series of icons before an inspirational trip to Greece put new thoughts in motion. Space was brought into contact with letters and signs. Space and symbols (letters and signs) had a lot of similarities to Mike Rose, especially through their limitless possibilities. This was the beginning of ‚ÄúMultidimensional Constructions‚Äù (‚ÄúMultidimensionale Konstruktionen‚Äù). After a further dealing with space and the differing levels of perception, Mike Rose created the ‚ÄúMultidimensional Rooms‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMultidimensional Thinking‚Äù (‚ÄúMultidimensionale R√§ume‚Äù und ‚ÄúMultidimensionales Denken‚Äù). * 1995‚Äì2006, Emotions: After the phase of multidimensional paintings, it was emotions that became Mike Rose's focus. The informational dialogue, the togetherness and the self-recognition were the artist's main concern and his legacy. Eva Harker comments: ‚ÄúThis description of the state of the soul in generous, colourful picture-script encourages to relent to the feeling, the spontaneity, and the moods, and to become more aware of one‚Äôs own fantasy. But it is not only the human being as a self- obsessed person that is singled out, as well as the human being as a fellow being in the context of his environment.‚Äù Eva Harker (S. 5‚Äì10) in: \\"Mike Rose.

She was an elder sister to the former Emperor of Japan, Emperor Akihito. She married Toshimichi Takatsukasa on 21 May 1950. As a result, she gave up her imperial title and left the Japanese Imperial Family, as required by law. ==Biography== Princess Taka was born at the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Her childhood appellation was . As was the practice of the time, she was not raised by her biological parents, but by a succession of court ladies at a separate palace built for her and her younger sisters in the Marunouchi district of Tokyo. She graduated from the Gakushuin Peer's School in March 1948, and spent a year in the household of former Chamberlain of Japan Saburo Hyakutake learning skills to be a bride. Emperor Hirohito, Empress Nagako, Empress Dowager Sadako (20 May 1950) On 20 May 1950, she married Toshimichi Takatsukasa, the eldest son of ex-Duke and guji of Meiji Shrine, Nobusuke Takatsukasa. The marriage received much publicity as it was the first marriage of a member of the imperial family to a commoner. Though legally commoners following the Second World War, the Takatsukasa family had been part of the ancient court nobility (kuge), with the peerage title of duke in the pre-war kazoku peerage (and would therefore have been considered a traditional family for an Imperial marriage). Nobusuke Takatsukasa was the first cousin of Empress Teimei through his father Takatsukasa Hiromichi, making his son and daughter-in-law second cousins once removed (as the groom's grandfather and the bride's great-grandfather were siblings). On 28 January 1966, Toshimichi Takatsukasa was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning at the apartment of his mistress, Michiko Maeda, a Ginza nightclub hostess, giving rise to widely speculative rumors in the Japanese press about his alleged double suicide. After her husband's death, Kazuko's misfortunes continued, as seven months later, on 22 August 1966, a knife-wielding intruder broke into her home in the middle of the night and assaulted her, causing injuries to her right and left hands and resulting in hospitalization for one week. A shocked Emperor Sh≈çwa ordered that she relocate to within the Akasaka Estate in Akasaka, Tokyo, where she lived until her death of heart failure at the age of 59, months after her father died. From 1974 to 1988 she served as chief priestess (saishu) of Ise Shrine, taking over the role from her great-aunt Fusako Kitashirakawa. The Takatsukasas had no children, but adopted their nephew Naotake Matsudaira (born 1945) of the former Ogyu Matsudaira clan, as their heir.

The town was surveyed during March 1862 by A Cooper and land offered for auction on 14 August 1862. The town was named by Dominick Daly, the Governor of South Australia after Henry Pelham F.P. Clinton, the Duke of Newcastle who served as \\"the Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1859 until his death in October 1864.\\" The port was surveyed in 1862, with a jetty being erected in 1863. Surveys and closer settlement by farmers soon followed, along with land clearing of the mallee woodland. The first European occupiers were leaseholder pastoralists. In 1854 in the northern parts of the Hundred of Clinton, W. & A. Rogers leased at an annual rental of ten shillings per square mile. In 1860, near the centre of the Hundred, T. & W. Day leased . This was an important and busy port in the 1860s and 70s, being a transfer point for goods and passengers travelling between Port Adelaide and the copper mines at Wallaroo and Moonta. That was despite the shallowness of the beach, which closed the port to larger vessels during low tide. On 28 November 1878, the District Council of Clinton was established. Clinton began a gradual decline after 1878 when the railway between Wallaroo and Adelaide was completed. The jetty was dismantled in 1916. Boundaries for the locality were created on 27 May 1999 for the \\"long established name.\\" The name Port Clinton was reported in 2013 as being a \\"variant\\" name and as being the \\"incorrect name for town.\\" ==Present day== Clinton, \\"the Gateway to the Eastern Yorke Peninsula\\", is a 1.5 hour drive from the capital of South Australia, Adelaide. Having a boat ramp, Clinton is popular for trailer boating. It has a beach for children, along with recreational fishing and crabbing areas. Raking for blue swimmer crabs is done on the extensive mud flats at low tide. As a result, since the 1950s the township has attracted the construction of beach and holiday houses. Accommodation in the town is varied and includes the Beach Front Caravan and Cabin Park and various holiday rentals. Shopping is available at the Local General Store and in the township of Ardrossan a 23 km down the road. The rural land surrounding Clinton is primarily used for dry grain farming of wheat and barley, with some sheep grazing. ==Notable residents== * George McLeay, Minister in the Menzies government and member of the Australian House of Representatives * Sir John McLeay, longest serving speaker of the Australian House of Representatives and former Lord Mayor of Adelaide ==See also== * List of cities and towns in South Australia * Clinton Conservation Park ==References *Yorke Peninsula website Category:Coastal towns in South Australia Category:Yorke Peninsula Category:Gulf St Vincent ","title":"Clinton, South Australia"},{"id":"20408549","text":"Christ Church, High Harrogate is a parish church in the Church of England located in Harrogate.

She runs the record label Bird. Weaver has performed as part of the Britpop group Kill Laura, the folktronica project Misty Dixon, and as a solo artist. She was brought up in the town of Widnes, Cheshire. ==Kill Laura== Kill Laura began when Weaver was in sixth form college. Between 1993 and 1996 Kill Laura released five singles, two on Polydor and three on the Manchester Records label run by Rob Gretton, owner of The Ha√ßienda and manager of New Order. Kill Laura disbanded in 1997. ==Misty Dixon== Weaver formed Misty Dixon in 2002. The band originally consisted of Weaver, Anna Greenwood, Dave Tyack and Sam Yates. Misty Dixon released several singles, and one album, Iced To Mode (2003). However, the release of the album was shrouded in tragedy following the disappearance of Tyack in August 2002. Misty Dixon split up in 2004. ==Solo career== Weaver's solo career began shortly after the demise of Kill Laura. She recorded an album for Manchester records in 1998, Supersister, but it was left unreleased following the death of Gretton in May 1999. A single, 'Everyone Knows Everyone Else', recorded in collaboration with Doves and Andy Votel, was released from the Supersister sessions. Weaver continued her solo career alongside Misty Dixon. Following a number of singles Weaver's first album, Like An Aspen Leaf, was released in 2002. It featured contributions from Andy Votel, Dave Tyack, Rick Tomlinson (Voice of the Seven Woods), Sam Yates, Naomi Hart and two members of Elbow, Craig Potter and Richard Jupp. Her second album, Seven Day Smile (2006) was a collection of home recordings and material from the Supersister era. By the time of her third album, Cherlokalate (2007), Weaver was exploring more psychedelic folk and Americana influences. The NME review of Cherlokalate (2007) declared that \\"Jane Weaver is the sound of Cat Power if she'd grown up next door to Oasis, stealing their Beatles records and outshining them at the school Christmas concert\\". The Fallen By Watchbird, Weaver's fourth album, was released in 2010. The Guardian wrote \\"Psych folk is back. It may have died out with the hippies in the 1970s, but now it has merged with folktronica, and the result here is not as twee and pretentious as one might fear‚Ä¶ Weaver's fragile, unworldly voice is carefully balanced against more muscular backing\\". The album also received a four (out of five) star review in Mojo.Tyler, Kieron (July 2010) Spindle Wakes: Album Review of Fallen By Watchbird, Mojo, London; Weaver wrote a fairytale book to accompany the album. A remix album, The Watchbird Alluminate (2011), featured interpretations by electronic artists including Demdike Stare and The Focus Group. In 2011, Weaver recorded the library music recording Intiaani Kes√§ for filmmaker and fashion designer of the brand Ivana Helsinki. A track from the project, 'Parade of the Blood Red Sorrows', was also featured in the 2012 film Kiss of the Damned. The title of Weaver's sixth album, The Silver Globe (2014), is derived from the 1988 film On The Silver Globe by Andrzej ≈ªu≈Çawski. It features contributions from Cybotron, Badly Drawn Boy and David Holmes. Her song \\"The Electric Mountain\\" uses a sample of \\"Star Cannibal\\" from Church of Hawkwind (1982). The Silver Globe was critically acclaimed as an artistic breakthrough and named Piccadilly Records Album of the Year 2014. Weaver appears on the cover artwork of the 2002 Badly Drawn Boy album Have You Fed the Fish?. Coldplay's song \\"Another's Arms\\", from Ghost Stories (2014), features a vocal sample from The Fallen By Watchbird album track, \\"Silver Chord\\". Weaver said that Chris Martin telephoned her directly for permission to use it. 2015's The Amber Light album is an extension of The Silver Globe, with three remixes from that album alongside four new songs and three instrumentals. It was made available both with the \\"Deluxe Version\\" of The Silver Globe and as a separate release. A new album, Modern Kosmology was released in 2017, with Can vocalist Malcolm Mooney performing guest vocals on the track \\"Ravenspoint\\". During October and November 2018, Weaver completed the short \\"Loops in the Secret Society\\" solo tour of England and Scotland, in support of her two most recent albums. Loops in the Secret Society is also the title of her new double album out in June 2019 on Fire Records. The album contains reimagined and remixed versions of songs from her two previous albums. The deluxe bookback CD edition, released on 15 November, also contains a DVD featuring the experimental film installation which was featured on her previous tour. It was directed by Nick Farrimond. The first single from the album, Slow Motion (Loops Variation), was released in March. Together with Peter Philipson and Raz Ullah under the name of Fenella, Weaver will release on Fire Records a reimagined soundtrack to the 1981 animation cult movie \\"Feh√©rl√≥fia\\" by Hungarian director Marcell Jankovics. The album was released on vinyl only on 8 November 2019 on Fire Records. ==Bird Records== Bird Records is an offshoot of Twisted Nerve Records and the Finders Keepers reissue label, and is run by Weaver. Bird was founded in 2002 and mainly releases recordings by contemporary female folk artists. These include early recordings by Beth Jeans Houghton and Emma Tricca. Most notably, Bird released the 2007 compilation album Bearded Ladies. The album brought together both contemporary and vintage psychedelic folk female singers such as Brigitte Fontaine, Bonnie Dobson, Susan Christie and Cate Le Bon. The album has spawned a club night at the Dulcimer bar in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. Weaver, and many of the artists featured on 'Bearded Ladies', performed at the 2007 Meltdown Festival, curated by Jarvis Cocker as part of the 'Lost Ladies of Folk' event. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Like An Aspen Leaf (mini album) (2002) * Seven Day Smile (2006) * Cherlokalate (2007) * The Fallen By Watchbird (2010) * The Watchbird Alluminate (2011) * Le Rose De Fer/Intiaani Kes√§ (Soundtrack, with Pierre Ralph) (2013) * The Silver Globe (2014) * The Amber Light (2015) * Modern Kosmology (2017) * Loops In The Secret Society (2019) * Feh√©rl√≥fia (2019) (By Fenella - Soundtrack, with Peter Philipson & Raz Ullah) ==References * Official website * July 2017 interview in The Independent Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:English songwriters Category:English singer-songwriters Category:Musicians from Liverpool Category:People from Widnes Category:21st- century English singers Category:21st-century English women singers ","title":"Jane Weaver"},{"id":"20408691","text":"Delta Force soldiers pictured deep behind Iraqi lines during the 1991 Gulf War The US-Army special mission unit commonly known as Delta Force has been portrayed often in popular culture in novels, films, television, and games. == Books == * Several Chris Ryan novels, though told from the POV of Special Air Service troopers, make casual references to Delta Force.

The first passenger trains between Brisbane and Sydney ran on 16 January 1888, when the New South Wales Main Northern line opened. Trains operated via Gowrie Junction on the Western line until 1915 when the Drayton Deviation opened, shaving 30 minutes off journey times. As all trains from Brisbane to Warwick and beyond had to travel via Toowoomba, a proposal to provide a direct line to Warwick, known as the Via Recta, was developed. That would have involved another crossing of the Main Range through Spicers Gap, involving a spiral loop with uncompensated 1-in-33 grades and radius curves, giving a ruling grade equivalent of 1 in 27. The Via Recta proposal would have involved very significant construction costs, and once it was agreed to extend the standard gauge line from Casino to South Brisbane, the need for the Via Recta disappeared. In 1904, the South Western railway line was opened. It left the Southern railway just south of Warwick station to initially reach Thane and then Dirranbandi more than 400 km to the west. In December 1910 the Roessler railway station was established at the point between Thulimbah and Stanthorpe. It was named after a pioneer fruitgrower in the district. In September 1916 it was renamed Applethorpe railway station due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. Prior to the completion of the New South Wales North Coast line in 1930, the Southern line formed part of the main interstate rail link between Brisbane and Sydney via the New South Wales Main Northern line. The railway systems of the two states use different gauges, Queensland uses while New South Wales uses . This necessitated a break of gauge at Wallangarra with the station consisting of an island platform, with Queensland Railways using the west side and the New South Wales Government Railways the east. The state border traverses the station platform at its southern end. A triangle was located to the north of the station to allow locomotives to be turned. The last train to operate on the New South Wales line ran in January 1988.\\"To the Border or Bust\\" Railway Digest March 1988 page 99 There were various proposals to transfer the New South Wales line to Armidale to Queensland Rail but nothing ever eventuated. \\"Glen Innes - Wallangarra may go to QR\\" Railway Digest April 1990 page 130 Queensland Rail ceased freight services to Wallangarra in March 2007.\\"Level Crossing Safety: Warwick to Wallangarra\\" Railway Digest April 2013 pages 40-43 The Australian Railway Historical Society operated a twice yearly service to Wallangarra as The Winelander.

A daily service was provided, departing Brisbane at 19:00, pausing at Toowoomba at 00:30 and arriving at Wallangarra at 07:45. The return service departed Wallangarra at 17:00, pausing at Toowoomba at 00:45 and arriving in Brisbane at 06:15. At Wallangarra passengers transferred to the New South Wales Government Railways' Brisbane Limited. A travelling post office was added to the Warwick train in 1877, and extended to Stanthorpe, and then Wallangarra as the line was extended. This was removed from the train in 1932 as a cost saving measure. In 1908, the Sydney Mail departed Brisbane at 07:10, calling at Toowoomba at 11:10 and after changing trains at Wallangarra, passengers arrived in Sydney at 11:10 the following day. The return service departed Sydney at 17:10, arriving in Brisbane at 21:10 the following day. Carriage connections were introduced in 1908, with a Parlour Car introduced in 1923, and a Buffet Car in 1924. The Parlour Car was transferred to the Townsville Mail in 1930 following the opening of the Standard Gauge line to Brisbane. Foot-warmers were introduced to the first class compartments of the Sydney Mail in 1911, and provided each winter until 1958. In 1947, the four Mail Trains per week was reduced to two per week, and was withdrawn on 1 February 1972.\\"20 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest February 1992 page 81 The last passenger on the line, the Dirranbandi Mail that operated as far as Warwick, was withdrawn on 11 February 1993. ==Preservation== The Southern Downs Steam Railway is based in Warwick and operate steam trains on the line about once a month to Wallangarra.Welcome aboard Southern Downs Steam Railway ==See also== *Rail transport in Queensland *Travelling post office, Queensland *Quart Pot Creek Rail Bridge ==References * *1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Darling Downs Category:Railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1871 Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Australia Category:1871 establishments in Australia ","title":"Southern railway line"},{"id":"20408787","text":"FC MVD Rossii () is a Russian football club from Moscow, founded in 2007.

She was the eleventh ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name (or a variant of it), and was noted for her Arctic exploration work; in 1876 she reached a record latitude of 82¬∞ North. Alert briefly served with the US Navy, and ended her career with the Canadian Marine Service as a lighthouse tender and buoy ship. ==Construction== The wooden sloops of the Cruizer class were designed under the direction of Lord John Hay, and after his \\"Committee of Reference\\" was disbanded, their construction was supervised by the new Surveyor of the Navy, Sir Baldwin Walker. Ordered together with her co-ship on 2 April 1853, Alert was laid down at the Royal Dockyard, Pembroke in January 1855. It was fitted at Chatham with a two- cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine, which was supplied by Ravenhill & Salkeld at a cost of ¬£6,052 and generated an indicated horsepower of ; driving a single screw, this gave a maximum speed of . The class was given a barque-rig sail plan. ==Armament== All the ships of the class were provided with one 32-pounder (56 cwt) long gun on a pivot mount and sixteen 32-pounder (32 cwt) carriage guns in a broadside arrangement. When converted for Arctic exploration in 1874, her armament was reduced to a token outfit of four Armstrong breech-loaders. ==HistoryPacific Station (1857‚Äì1868)=== Alert spent the first 11 years of her life on the Pacific Station, based at Esquimalt at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, Canada. Alert Bay, British Columbia is named after the ship, and nearby Pearse Island, at the north entrance to Johnstone Strait, is named after Commander William Alfred Rumbulow Pearse, her commanding officer. During this period it returned to Plymouth between October 1861 and May 1863 for a refit. Her service on the Pacific station was the type of work for which her class had been designed‚Äîthe policing of Britain's far-flung maritime empire. A photograph exists of Alert at Esquimalt, British Columbia from 1867, and it is further attested to by the following extract from The Colonist newspaper: Alert paid off at Plymouth on 30 May 1868 and was placed in the Steam Reserve. === Arctic exploration (1874‚Äì1876) === HMS Alert pushed aground by ice, Radmore Harbour, 1875‚Äì1876 (Illustrated London News, 1876) An orthographic projection showing the location of Alert, Nunavut In 1874, Alert was taken in hand for conversion to the role of Arctic exploration. Her single-expansion engine was replaced with an R & W Hawthorn compound-expansion engine, it was re-boilered to , her armament was reduced to four guns and her hull was strengthened with felt- covered iron. Above the waterline it was sheathed with teak, and below it, Canadian elm and pitch-pine. The modifications caused her displacement to increase to 1,240 tons. The British Arctic Expedition was commanded by Captain George Strong Nares, and comprised Alert (Captain Nares) and (Captain Henry Frederick Stephenson). The expedition aimed to reach the North Pole via Smith Sound, the sea passage between Greenland and Canada's northernmost island, Ellesmere Island. Contemporary geographers proposed that there could be an Open Polar Sea, and that if the thick layer of ice surrounding it were overcome, access to the North Pole by sea might be possible. Ever since Edward Augustus Inglefield had penetrated Smith Sound in 1852, it had been a likely route to the North. Despite finding heavier-than-expected ice, the expedition pressed on. Leaving Discovery to winter at Lady Franklin Bay, Alert pressed on a further through the Robeson Channel, establishing her winter quarters at Floeberg Beach. Spring 1876 saw considerable activity by sledge, charting the coasts of Ellesmere Island and Greenland, but scurvy had begun to take hold, with Alert suffering the greatest burden. On 3 April the second-in-command of Alert, Albert Hastings Markham, took a party north to attempt the Pole. By 11 May, having made slow progress, they reached their greatest latitude at 83¬∞ 20' 26\\"N. Suffering from snow blindness, scurvy and exhaustion, they turned back. The expedition was rewarded on its return; Nares was knighted, Markham was promoted to captain. The geography of northern Canada and Greenland is dotted with the names of those connected with the expedition: Nares Strait, Nares Lake, Markham Ice Shelf, Ayles Ice Shelf, and Mount Ayles. The northernmost permanently inhabited place on earth, the settlement of Alert at the northern point of Ellesmere Island, was named for the ship. === Survey (1876‚Äì1884) === Alert recommissioned at Chatham on 20 August 1878 under the command of Captain Sir George Strong Nares for a survey of the Strait of Magellan. On 12 March 1879 Captain John Fiot Lee Pearse Maclear took command, and under him she went to Australia Station and the Pacific. She was employed in surveying, but the presence of Doctor Richard Coppinger, her surgeon, ensured that she also made a huge contribution to the field of zoology. Coppinger, who had also served in the Arctic expedition, was an accomplished naturalist and his collections from the period 1878‚Äì1882, which included indigenous cultural artifacts purloined, as he admitted, from Mutumui sites on Clack Island,Peter Sutton,'The Flinders Islands and Cape Melville people in history,' Jean-Christophe Verstraete, DSisane Hafrner (eds.), Land and Language in Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf Country, = John Benjamins Publishing Company 2016 p.90 added 1,300 species to the National Collection.From the preface to the Report on the zoological collections made in the Indo-Pacific Ocean during the voyage of HMS Alert, 1881-2, published by the British Museum, 1884 Alert paid off at Sheerness on 20 September 1882. === Loan to the US Navy (1884) === Adolphus Greely led the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition to the Arctic in 1881. Two supply ships failed to reach his party, and a relief expedition in 1883 also failed to extract the team. The US Navy put together a further relief expedition in 1884 under Captain W. S. Schley, and Alert was offered. She was loaned to the US Navy under the command of Captain George W Coffin on 20 February 1884, and was used to set up supply dumps to support in the extrication of Greely and his men. Two members of Greely's expedition, Lieutenant James B. Lockwood and Sergeant David Legge Brainard had achieved a new record of 83¬∞ 30'N, just closer to the Pole than Markham had achieved in 1876. Lockwood and 19 other members of the expedition died; Greely, Brainard and four others survived. === Loan to the Canadian Government === In September 1880, the United Kingdom transferred its rights of Arctic sovereignty to Canada. From 1884 to 1886 the Canadian Marine Service of the Department of Marine and Fisheries sent an expedition to Hudson Bay to establish observation posts and to estimate the length of season for ice-free navigation. A former lieutenant of the Royal Navy, Andrew Robertson Gordon, was placed in command, and a suitable ship was sought. Having finished her work with the US Navy, Alert seemed the ideal vessel for the task. She was sailed to the Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax and transferred by the senior naval officer to the marine agent of the Department of Marine and Fisheries. Alert as a lighthouse supply ship in 1893 In 1886 she carried Captain Markham, who had been second-in-command of Alert during the 1876 Arctic Exploration, and now represented the interests of a railway company interested in building a line from Winnipeg to Hudson Bay. Captain Markham left the ship at York Factory, Manitoba and returned by the Hayes River canoe route. After the last Hudson Bay expedition in 1886, Alert was reconfigured as a light-house supply vessel and buoy tender. Her topmasts and yards were removed, and a wheelhouse was built abaft the remains of the main mast. She worked at first in Nova Scotia, but as her wooden hull showed signs of deterioration, she was moved to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, sailing out of Quebec. Thirty years after her launch little was left of her original appearance; in essence she was now a small, old, low-powered steamer showing the scars of hard labour and many an ungainly conversion. Nevertheless, she continued to give useful service until the last decade of the nineteenth century. == Disposal and remains == Alerts figurehead and wheel exhibited at Mus√©e de la civilisation, Quebec City CGS Alert was laid up in November 1894 and sold, the bill of exchange being forwarded to the Admiralty, since she was still officially on loan, the total sum being 814 pounds, 2 shillings and 7 pence. The ship was probably broken up at an undisclosed location. The figurehead, wheel and other remains are part of the Mus√©e de la civilisation's collections in Quebec City.. == Legacy == CFS Alert, a Canadian military listening post, Alert, Nunavut the world's northernmost continuously inhabited settlement, and Alert Bay, British Columbia, are named after the ship. == See also == * European and American voyages of scientific exploration == Citations  Sources == * == External links == * * Category:1856 ships Category:Arctic exploration vessels Category:Cruizer-class sloops Category:Ships built in Pembroke Dock Category:Survey vessels of the Royal Navy Category:Victorian-era sloops of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Alert (1856)"},{"id":"20408935","text":"Waste is a play by the English author Harley Granville Barker.

Because of its investment features, insurance carriers in the United States typically register offerings of variable life insurance with federal and state securities regulators. To register the offering, carriers typically need to provide some level of detail of the investment selections within the policy. Without knowing the specifics of each potential client's investment profile, carriers often settle for registering a uniform offering that includes a selection of mutual funds or hedge funds as investment options within the policy. Not all investments are suitable for placement within these policies. They are better suited to absolute return and hedged strategies rather than equity based investments. Because of the volatility of the stock market the drawdowns within the investment portfolio tend to be larger and the owner may end up having to put more money into the policy to keep it in force if the account value drops considerably. This can become a very powerful tool for purposes of estate planning. In essence you can buy a hedge fund inside an insurance policy and the value will grow tax free and upon death the cash value of the policy passes to heirs tax free. See also Private Placement Variable Annuities. By comparison, private placement life insurance is offered without a formal securities registration. The advantage with this approach is that the carrier customizes the investment options within the policy to meet the needs of the prospective investor. The key disadvantage with this approach is that it is typically more expensive for a carrier to offer a customized policy to a client. For this reason, private placement life insurance is typically only offered to qualified purchasers seeking to invest large sums of money (often more than US$1 million) in the policy. In addition, an attorney will be needed to help draw up the documents, adding to the cost of the purchase. == Offshore versus Domestic == While private placement life insurance (\\"PPLI\\") (a product also known as insurance wrappers) first developed in the United States, the industry has witnessed significant growth in the placement of PPLI offshore. Offshore insurance companies specializing in PPLI typically offer the product as a financial service for high net worth clients and price their services as a provider, rather than as a traditional insurance carrier. For example, most offshore carriers are prohibited to maintain a domestic sales force; therefore, their products often do not include significant sales loads and commissions. Also, offshore carriers rarely engage in advertising. These reduced marketing costs enable the offshore carrier to provide PPLI to high- net-worth clients at a significantly reduced cost. The regulatory climate governing life insurance in certain offshore jurisdictions is also not as restrictive as may be found in the United States. Some of the better known jurisdictions to offer the product are Luxembourg, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Barbados and Bermuda. While the lack of plentiful offshore regulation may not be comforting to traditional insurance consumers, high-net- worth individuals and their advisors are more likely to be able to carefully examine the merits and risks associated with insurance products from offshore carriers. Especially in Europe PPLI offers a lot of tax benefits. In all the European countries where the product is available the product offers at least a tax deferral, and in most European countries there are also substantial income, wealth and inheritance tax benefits. It is therefore that a growing number of financial advisors change existing offshore company, family foundation and trust structures in to PPLI solutions. The product also offers solid asset and investment protection features, which makes the product even more interesting. ==PPLI outside the USA== Private Placement Life Insurance in one form or another is gaining popularity throughout Europe and the rest of the world as it is used in many cases as a substitute for a trust or Foundation or to strengthen existing structures by adding ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô. Many Tax authorities are looking through trusts and not accepting the trustees as the legal owner of the assets and this can cause difficulties that are not experienced when using PPLI. Due to the unique nature of the relationship between the life company, the individual and the contents of the life policy, PPLI can be used to overcome specific issues such as management and control, beneficial ownership and substance. Since the Life company is recognized as the legal owner of the assets, in most cases they will also be outside the reach of future creditors. Protection and Privacy are a major feature of PPLI and a policy issued by a Luxembourg insurer is covered by the unique ‚ÄòTriangle of Security‚Äô.See http://ascyprus.com/the-luxembourg-triangle-of-security/. With the introduction of directives in support of tax transparency by various governmental bodies over the last few years, the privacy of previously secure structures is not nearly so secure.Andrew Knight and Anthony Markham, ‚ÄúIs there room for privacy planning in a tax‚Äìtransparent world?‚Äù International Investment, 23 November 2016 A properly set up contract can also protect against bank failure and ‚ÄòBail Ins‚Äô by holding cash off any bank balance sheet, whilst at the same time often providing capital guarantees not available elsewhere. In the current climate legislating on money laundering, tax evasion and avoidance, structures with real commercial substance will be expected and demanded and PPLI contracts can provide this on a compliant basis. PPLI policies can be an invaluable resource for those seeking tax efficiency, a decreased reporting burden, asset protection or confidentiality. However, due to the complexities an experienced adviser with specialist knowledge of international insurance arrangements should always be consulted. == Expanded Worldwide Planning == There exist a number of structures that provide clients security from data breaches, erroneous government reporting, and the \\"blanket and indiscriminate nature of automatic exchange under CRS\\". Among these structures, Expanded Worldwide Planning (EWP) is a concept that has emerged. It offers international families a framework that enhances privacy and asset protection within a flexible, open architecture platform. For example, Advanced Financial Solutions Inc. is one proponent of EWP.See http://www.advancedfinancialsolutionscom.vg It is an element of international taxation created to implement directives from several tax authorities following the 2008 worldwide recession. EWP gives privacy and compliance with tax laws. It also enhances protection from data breach and strengthens family security. It allows for a tax compliant system that still respects basic rights of privacy. EWP addresses the concerns of law firms and international planners about some aspects of CRS related to their clients' privacy. EWP assists with the privacy and welfare of families by protecting their financial records and keeping them in compliance with tax regulations. == References == Category:Life insurance Category:Tax incidence ","title":"Private placement life insurance"},{"id":"20409308","text":"Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Donnelly (born in Boston, Massachusetts) is an Irish-American law attorney, writer and political contributor residing in Ireland.

On the ground, there is a range of country fair attractions. == History and organisation == The event first started in 2000 as a small fete. In the years since then the show has grown in stature. Attendances have increased, and at the 2009 show there were over 10,000 people. For many years the show was known simply as the Abingdon Fayre, but in 2007 the show's title changed to Abingdon Air & Country Show to more accurately reflect the show's content. Although held on a military establishment, the show is a civilian event. It is organised entirely by volunteers, with proceeds being donated to a local charity. == Aircraft == A wide range of aircraft have performed flying displays at the show. These have included many modern and classic fast jets (for example Sepecat Jaguar, BAE Hawk, Hawker Hunter, Folland Gnat) military helicopters from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, historic warbirds like the Spitfire and Mustang and displays from light aerobatic aircraft. In 2009 there was a visit by an RAF C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, and in 2011 the Avro Vulcan XH558 performed the closing display. The show has also managed to attract international participation. In 2005 the Polish Navy brought a PZL M-28 for static display, while in both 2006 and 2008 the US Army exhibited a UH-60 Black Hawk and in 2010 the Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 display team performed. Traditionally, the show also includes participation from the resident No 612 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which uses the airfield during the weekend for its flying activities.

He is known as the main hero of the tale of \\"The Taking of Joppa\\". Djehuty bears the titles king's scribe, overseer of troops (general) and overseer of the northern foreign countries in contemporary Egyptian records. ==Biography== Djehuty is known from two sources. His undisturbed burial was found in 1824 at Saqqara and he is the main personality in the Egyptian story of \\"The Taking of Joppa\\" (today Jaffa). The Egyptian narrative is preserved on a papyrus now located in the British Museum (EA 10060). The city of Joppa had rebelled against Thutmose III's authority and the pharaoh responded by dispatching an Egyptian army under Djehuty to regain control over the city. Djehuty first cunningly arranged to have a parley or talk with the rebel leader of Joppa at a location outside of the city walls. Once he was alone with the leader of the rebellion, Djehuty promptly smote the man on his forehead and captured him.Robert Armour, Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt, American University Press in Cairo, 2001. p. 113 With this task accomplished, Djehuty decided to take control of the city by subterfuge. Djehuty first falsely proclaimed that he, Djehuty, had been defeated by the rebels and was now sending a \\"tribute\\" to the inhabitants of Joppa. The tribute came in the form of two hundred baskets which were delivered to Joppa as a peace offering by Djehuty. Unbeknownst to Joppa's inhabitants, however, each of the baskets concealed one of the two hundred of Djehuty's own soldiers. The governor of Joppa, fooled by Djehuty's ruse, had them taken into the city through its city gates. Soon after, Djehuty's soldiers rose out of their baskets and quickly captured the city and seized its citizens. The Egyptian description of the capture of Joppa is, hence, somewhat similar to the story of the Trojan Horse which hypothetically occurred some two centuries later at Troy. With Joppa now firmly back in Egyptian hands, Djehuty sent word to his king, Thutmose III, of his triumph: ==General Djehuty's historicity== General Djehuty's gold bracelet (Leiden) Djehuty was not a fictional person. In the winter of 1824, Bernardino Drovetti found his completely undisturbed tomb at Saqqara. In these early days, Egyptian archaeology was in its infancy and only a few notes of the excavations were ever made. Today, there are only brief descriptions of the discovery preserved in archaeological records. The objects were sold to different museum collections all around the world and, in most cases, can only be ascribed with certainty to Djehuty's tomb when they bear his name. The objects found in the general's tomb include a solid golden and a silver bowl, both today in the Louvre, four canopic jars now in Florence, the heart scarab, a gold bracelet in the Rijksmuseum of Leiden and Djehuty's dagger in Darmstadt. Nothing is known about Djehuty's coffin and mummy, although they were briefly mentioned by Drovetti. It is also believed that the Ashburnham ring, which is \\"one of the most spectacular pieces of Egyptian jewellery to be added to the [British Museum's] national collection for many years\\" also originated from General Djehuty's burial.Nicholas Reeves, The Ashburnham ring and the burial of General Djehuty\\", JEA 79 (1993), p.259 The ring was originally purchased by the Earl of Ashburnham in Cairo in 1825 likely from the proceeds of excavation work carried out by Drovetti in Saqqara and Djehuty's tomb was only discovered in the previous year. This rectangular swivel, bezel ring weighs 35.8 grams and is inscribed on both its sides with the texts: \\"He of the Two Ladies, Great of terror in all lands\\" and \\"Menkheperre, beloved of Ptah, radiant of face.\\"Reeves, op. cit., p.260 Since Christine Lilyquist's study of Djehuty's gold bowl and other funerary objects showed that Djehuty was likely buried at Saqqara and not Thebes as originally assumed, it would appear that the Ashburnham ring came from Djehuty's tomb treasures.Christine Lilyquist, MMJ 23 (1988) S9 (14), 60 (II) Djehuty's golden bowl in the Louvre contains an inscription which records that it was a gift by Thutmose III to his general: :Granted by royal favor of Menkheperre [Thutmose III], King of Upper and Lower Egypt, to his excellency the noble, father of the god, beloved of the god, man of confidence of the king in all foreign lands and on the islands amid the sea, he who fills the stores with lapis lazuli, silver and gold, the general...[and] the royal scribe Djehuty, acquitted.General Djehuty's Gold Cup, 1455 BCE The Centre for Online Judaic Studies == References Literature == *C.

Eight smaller banners represent skills and trades needed to stage a theatrical production. ==Plays== Members of the Players put on three one-act plays each \\"Frolic.\\" Frolics take place on the first Saturday evening of the month, October through April, with the following exceptions: November, where a full three-act play is presented, and January, where the frolic is replaced with an annual fund raising event such as a \\"Millionaire's Party.\\" All roles, as well as direction, costuming, set construction, and the like, are taken by members. In the Shakespearean tradition, all roles on stage are played by men. ==Site== The bed of Parents Creek lies underneath one corner of the building. Near this site on July 31, 1763, the Battle of Bloody Run (so called because the creek ran red with blood) took place between Chief Pontiac and British forces.The Players Penthouse from Detroit1701.org A state of Michigan historical marker commemorating this battle sits in front of this building. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Marijean Levering, Detroit on Stage: The Players Club, 1910-2005, Wayne State University Press, 2007, * ==See also== *Players (disambiguation) ==External links== *The Players Club Detroit Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Theatres in Detroit Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1925 Category:1910 establishments in Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Event venues established in 1925 Category:Organizations based in Detroit Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"The Players (Detroit, Michigan)"},{"id":"20409522","text":"Mythimna litoralis, the shore wainscot, is a moth of the family Noctuidae.
