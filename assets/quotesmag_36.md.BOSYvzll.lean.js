Previously, he was a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. ==Biography== McFadden received his Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, from Wheaton College in Illinois, and his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he served on the editorial board of the Virginia Law Review. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Columbia and as counsel to the United States Deputy Attorney General. He also has extensive experience as a law enforcement officer, having served as both a Deputy Sheriff in the Madison County Sheriff's Office and as a police officer with the Fairfax County Police Department. McFadden clerked for Judge Steven Colloton on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He was previously a partner in the Compliance, Investigations & Government Enforcement Group in the Washington, D.C. office of Baker McKenzie, where he represented clients in white collar matters, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations, anti-money laundering compliance work, and U.S. trade compliance matters. Before becoming a judge, McFadden served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. ==Federal judicial service== Nomination and confirmation On June 7, 2017, President Trump nominated McFadden to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Richard J. Leon, who took senior status on December 31, 2016. A hearing on his nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on June 28, 2017. On July 20, 2017, his nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On October 30, 2017, the United States Senate voted 84‚Äì10 in favor of his confirmation. He received his judicial commission on October 31, 2017. Tenure In April 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives requested that McFadden issue a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's plan to divert about $6 billion from military construction and counter-drug appropriations to build a wall along the U.S-Mexico border, arguing that the Trump administration's action violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause.Ann E. Marimow, Court sides with House Democrats in challenge to Trump‚Äôs border wall spending, Washington Post (September 25, 2020). In June 2019, McFadden ruled that the House lacked standing to challenge the administration's diversion of funding and therefore dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. This ruling contradicted the 2015 ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in U.S. House of Representatives v. Azar, in which the court found that then-Republican- controlled House of Representatives had standing in a lawsuit against President Obama's Affordable Care Act. In September 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned McFadden's decision and reinstated the House's lawsuit. Citing the McGahn case, the appellate court held that a single house of Congress has \\"standing to pursue litigation against the Executive for injury to its legislative rights\\"; the court also criticized the Trump administration's argument that \\"the Executive Branch can freely spend Treasury funds as it wishes unless and until a veto-proof majority of both houses of Congress forbids it\\" as a position that \\"turns the constitutional order upside down.\\"Ann E.

Congressman Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has litigated to obtain Trump's tax returns, but McFadden has ruled other matters should be litigated prior to any such release. Trump's attorneys moved to dismiss the case, arguing congressional investigatory power is nonexistent. Should McFadden rule for the committee's request, Trump's attorneys claim further that Neal's proffered legislative purpose‚Äîoversight of mandatory presidential tax audits‚Äîis merely a pretext for securing and publicizing Trump's IRS 1040s forms.A Bit of Impeachment-um for Tax Return Quest?, Western Mass Politics and Insight, October 2, 2019.

McFadden was assigned to rule on a subpoena hearing in a case regarding a Russian businessman named in the Steele dossier who sued Buzzfeed News for libel for publishing the dossier. Fusion GPS, the research firm which had commissioned the dossier and to whom the subpoenas have been issued, requested that McFadden step down from the case for potential conflict of interest. Fusion GPS alleges that McFadden's connections to Trump‚Äîa $1,000 donation to Trump's 2016 campaign, some volunteer work performed by McFadden on Trump's transition team vetting potential Cabinet nominees, and the fact that Trump nominated McFadden to the bench‚Äîare grounds for dismissal. McFadden denied the recusal request. McFadden noted that he has little to no actual connection to the President, who is not a party to the lawsuit but has political interest in the suit, and has never even met the President. McFadden ruled \\"The President's connection with me and his interest in this case are simply too tenuous to cause a reasonable observer to question my impartiality.\\" Hofstra University law professor James Sample, an authority on the subject of recusal, said that while he found some of the McFadden's contentions \\"curious,\\" recusal did not appear to be required.Trump-appointed judge who donated to campaign refuses to recuse himself from dossier matter, ABC News, February 22, 2018, Retrieved October 3, 2019. ==Memberships== He has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2003. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Biography at U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American judges Category:Assistant United States Attorneys Category:Federalist Society members Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Category:Lawyers from Alexandria, Virginia Category:Lawyers from Washington, D.C.

Chalus, 24 February 1734 - Paris, 7 July 1821), was a French noblewoman and courtier. She was the mother of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara, possibly by king Louis XV of France. She was the lady-in-waiting of Louise √âlisabeth of France in 1749-59, and the influential favorite lady-in-waiting of Princess Marie Ad√©la√Øde of France in 1764-1800. ==Life== Fran√ßoise de Chalus was the daughter of Gabriel de Ch√¢lus, seigneur de Sansac, and Claire G√©rault de Solages. Lady-in-waiting to Louise √âlisabeth  On 10 July 1749, she married a noble of Spanish descent Don Jean Fran√ßois, 1er duc de Narbonne-Lara Grandee of Spain 1st Class, Lieutenant General of the Army, Commander in Name of the King of the Dioceses of Castres, Albi and Lavaur, 1st Gentleman of the House of H.R.H. the Duke of Parma (Aubiac, Lot-et-Garonne, 27 December 1718 - 12 August 1806). Her spouse was a member of the Spanish entourage of Louise √âlisabeth of France, who visited the French court at that time. Fran√ßoise de Chalus left France for the Duchy of Parma in Italy with her spouse in the retinue of √âlisabeth of France, and served for ten years as the lady-in- waiting of √âlisabeth of France. Circumstances around her son In 1755, she became the mother of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara. It is alleged that Louis XV was the biological father. According to documents of the Military Archive, her husband Jean Fran√ßois de Narbonne-Lara had been wounded 8 years earlier in the War of the Austrian Succession (1747), becoming from that moment on unable of having an offspring. The baptism of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara is another indication of that paternity.\\"On 25 of August of 1755, received the baptism at the Chapel of the King, from the Very High and Very Powerful Lord, Monseigneur Charles-Antoine de La Roche-Aymon, Archbishop- Primate of Narbonne, President of the States-Generals of the Province of Languedoc, Commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit. The Godfather was the Most High and Most powerful Prince Louis Auguste of France, Duke of Berry, and the Godmother the Most High and Most Powerful Princess Madame Marie Ad√©la√Øde of France.\\" His name was Louis, and his contemporaries remarked about the similarities between Louis and the King. Lady-in-waiting to Ad√©la√Øde  Upon the death of √âlisabeth of France in 1759, Fran√ßoise de Chalus settled in France, and in 1764, she succeeded the marquise de Civrac as dame d'atour to Madame Adelaide; she was promoted to dame d'honneur after duchesse de Beauvillier in 1781. She reportedly rivaled with the duchess de Civrac, dame d'honneur of Madame Victoire, in an attempt to distance the two sisters. After the accession of Louis XVI in 1774, she belonged to what was called the \\"Old Court\\" of the Mesdames at Bellevue. She was described as haughty and imperious, and while Civrac successfully hosted parties in the name of Madame Victoire, Narbonne (Fran√ßoise de Chalus) was reportedly not as successful, as her temperament did not attract people socially. A rumor claimed that it was in fact Madame Ad√©la√Øde who was the biological mother of Louis de Narbonne by an incestuous relation to her father, Louis XV. There is nothing to indicate that these rumors were true, though Louis de Narbonne was appointed the chevalier d'honneur of Adelaide, and was reportedly her spoiled favorite as well as the son of her favorite lady-in-waiting, and she reportedly \\"made enormous sacrifices to his caprices\\". His mother reportedly regularly made Adelaide pay his debts: :\\"Mme. de Narbonne, imperious as she was, was entirely dominated by the whims of her son Comte Louis. When he had committed any foolishness and was in want of :money, her ill-temper was unbearable, and she vented it chiefly upon Madame Adelaide, making her house intolerable. After a few days the poor Princess would :buy back her peace of mind in hard cash. In this way the Comte de Narbonne became possessed of enormous sums, which he procured without the least trouble and :accepted as easily.\\" Boigne, Louise- El√©onore-Charlotte-Ad√©laide d'Osmond, Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne (1781-1814), London, Heinemann, 1907 Exile Fran√ßoise de Chalus was the only lady-in-waiting Adelaide allowed to accompany her from the Palace of Versailles after the Women's March on Versailles on the outbreak of the French Revolution on 6 October 1789. In February 1791, she belonged to the large retinue that accompanied Adelaide and her sister Victoire from France to Rome. During their stay in Rome in 1791-96, the court of the Mesdames were divided in two rival fractions lead by the head lady-in-waiting of Madame Adelaide, de Narbonne, and her colleague in the court of Madame Victoire, Ang√©lique Victoire, Comtesse de Chastellux, who were called the Narbonne fraction and the Chastellux fraction. == References == Category:1734 births Category:1821 deaths Category:18th-century French people Category:Mistresses of Louis XV Category:French ladies-in-waiting Category:French duchesses ","title":"Fran√ßoise de Chalus"},{"id":"54250364","text":"Cover Your Tracks is an American metalcore band from Atlanta, Georgia.National Rock Review-12 May 2016 \\"Australian metalcore masters, Parkway Drive overpower a metal hungry Louisville crowd ...

Caputo said of himself that his physical health was in question, and his \\"mental health has definitely failed.\\" On September 24, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma that had spread from his throat to his neck and head.Trump advisor diagnosed with head cancer following leave of absence, Louise Hall, The Independent, September 24, 2020 ==Early life and education== Caputo was born in 1962 in Buffalo, New York, where he the bulk of his early years in the region known as the Southtowns. Caputo's early public relations work was in Hawaii while with the United States Army, which he joined directly after finishing high school. In 1983, after leaving the Army, he enrolled at the University at Buffalo. Caputo was employed by Republican politicians such as Congressman Jack Kemp. Caputo was mentored by Roger J. Stone Jr. in political advisement, and became his personal driver. He learned from Stone that political campaigns could be turned into wins for candidates if the public found them entertaining. ==Career== Reagan Administration and Bush campaign During the Reagan Administration, Caputo helped support the president's agenda in Central America. He worked with Oliver North to foment propaganda as part of Reagan's public relations efforts in South America and in Central America. After his work for the Reagan Administration he served as assistant director of the House of Representatives Gallery of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association. He next worked for President George H. W. Bush as director of media services in Bush's campaign in the 1992 United States presidential election. Russian advisor and media consultant After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Caputo established residence in Russia in 1994. He served as an adviser to Boris Yeltsin in 1995. In his capacity as advisor to Yeltsin, he was employed with the United States Agency for International Development. He served as president of The Florence Group from 1994 to 1999, and stated he \\"played a pivotal role in electing Boris Yeltsin to his second term as President of the Russian Federation.\\" Caputo was employed by a Moscow-headquartered subsidiary of Gazprom, Gazprom-Media. He was contracted by Gazprom in 2000 to work for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. His task was to increase Putin's public relations standing, specifically his support level in the U.S. He moved back from Russia to the U.S. in 2000. After returning to the U.S., Caputo was called by his former mentor Roger Stone, who convinced him to move to Miami Beach, Florida, and then Caputo founded his media advising company Michael Caputo Public Relations. Caputo moved back to Europe in 2007 while advising a politician's campaign for parliament in the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Paladino campaign Caputo worked as the campaign manager for real estate businessman Carl Paladino's unsuccessful campaign in the 2010 election for governor of New York state. During the campaign, Caputo was profiled by The New York Times, which described Caputo's \\"impish spirit and no-holds-barred campaign style\\" as a key factor helping Paladino, then a little-known figure, gain attention in seeking the Republican nomination for governor. Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and in an interview with The New York Times, Caputo embraced the outsider nature of Paladino's bid: \\"This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows that each of us comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything.\\" Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager: \\"I'm facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes. You've got to let them know they are going to get punished.\\" Work for Donald Trump  Donald Trump hired Caputo in 2014 to launch an astroturfing campaign in support of his stalking-horse bid for the Buffalo Bills. Caputo established a shell organization named \\"12th Man Thunder\\" (later renamed \\"Bills Fan Thunder\\" after a trademark dispute with the Texas A&M; Aggies football team) and hired a proxy leader, amputee Chuck Sonntag, whom Trump and Caputo calculated would garner sympathy. When Trump placed his bid and was disallowed ties to the organization, Caputo retaliated by engaging in a smear campaign against other bidders: Jon Bon Jovi and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The group's publicity efforts exacerbated an already-simmering anti-Toronto sentiment, but ultimately a competitor to both bids, Buffalo Sabres owner and natural gas tycoon Terrence Pegula and his wife Kim Pegula, prevailed and purchased the Bills franchise, significantly outbidding both Trump and Bon Jovi. Bills Fan Thunder remained in operation as a charity as of 2017.{{cite magazinefirst=Ben Schreckinger, Ben (October 26, 2017).

In 2016, offices of Michael Caputo Public Relations were located in East Aurora, New York. Caputo also had staff located in Miami Beach, Florida, and Moscow, Russia. During the 2016 New York Republican primary, Caputo became a political adviser to Trump in order to help him win the primary in that state. At the time of his hiring he was employed as a commentator on a political talk program on WBEN AM radio. In order to support Trump in New York, he joined forces with his former employer from the 2010 gubernatorial race, Carl Paladino. While working on the Trump campaign, Caputo was placed in charge of communications for the candidate in New York. Caputo was a senior adviser to Trump's political efforts from November 2015 to June 2016. On June 20, 2016, he was fired from the Trump campaign shortly after Corey Lewandowski was replaced as campaign manager by Paul Manafort. He had tweeted in support of Lewandowski's leaving; in his resignation letter to Manafort said he regretted the statement on Twitter.  Activities from 2016‚Äì2020  After Trump's election, Caputo maintained contacts with associates in the Trump administration. After news reports of Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia in May 2017, Caputo told the Associated Press that leaks from within the Trump Administration were caused by \\"a coordinated, silent coup.\\" Caputo told USA Today that he attributed the leaks to disaffected members of the Stop Trump movement, whom he called \\"anti-Trump zealots.\\" In 2019 and 2020, Caputo posted numerous sexually crude and sexist tweets directed at women.J. Edward Moreno, New spokesman at HHS directed crude comments to women in previous tweets: report, The Hill (May 1, 2020). In early 2020, Caputo posted multiple offensive and racist tweets about Chinese people; he deleted almost all of his past tweets before assuming a position at HHS. In early 2020 during President Trump's impeachment, Caputo wrote a book called The Ukraine Hoax: How Decades of Corruption in the Former Soviet Republic Led to Trump's Phony Impeachment. He also produced and hosted a documentary by the same name which was aired on the pro-Trump television channel One America News. Trump administration In April 2020, Caputo was appointed by the White House as assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for public affairs - in effect, the department's chief spokesperson. Caputo and other political appointees on his team tried to change, delay, suppress and retroactively edit scientific reports on COVID-19 by the Centers for Disease Control that were deemed to contradict or undermine what Trump was saying publicly, according to a report by Politico in September 2020. Caputo personally confirmed the report, saying that attempts to influence the content of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the CDC's weekly report of information and recommendations regarding public health, had been going on for 3 1/2 months. He said it was because the MMWR reporting contained \\"political content\\" as well as scientific information, adding that the changes suggested by his office were \\"infrequently\\" accepted by CDC. Caputo appointed Canadian Paul Alexander as his \\"scientific advisor\\". Alexander tried unsuccessfully to get all issues of MMWR held up until he personally approved them. He tried to prevent CDC scientists from writing or saying that COVID-19 could be transmitted by children, which he said had \\"zero\\" data to support it, and would undermine Trump's goal of having children return to school. In reply, other scientists cited published studies of transmission in summer camps and households. Citing concerns about the political leanings of CDC scientists, Caputo delayed for a month the publication of a report on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 that concluded \\"the potential benefits of these drugs do not outweigh their risks.\\" In emails to the head of CDC, Alexander accused CDC scientists of attempting to \\"hurt the president\\" and writing \\"hit pieces on the administration\\". CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. Emails obtained by The New York Times in September 2020 showed Caputo and Alexander working to discredit CDC scientists, notably principal deputy director Anne Schuchat, and to silence scientists speaking to the press, in an effort to depict a rosier outlook for the pandemic. A Department of Health and Human Services public awareness campaign largely funded at more than $300 million dollars by taxpayers, largely conceived and organized by Caputo although he had no medical training, intended to begin airing before the election, enlists celebrities reportedly to defeat despair regarding the coronavirus is being investigated by Democrats. In a Facebook video on September 13, Caputo related that the president himself demanded it of him.Rayasam, Renuka, How Barrett could affect the Covid-19 battle, Starstruck, First in Nightly, Politico, September 25, 2020 On September 13, 2020, Caputo asserted in a video on his personal Facebook page that CDC scientists were engaged in \\"sedition\\" with a \\"resistance unit\\" against Trump, and were \\"meeting in coffee shops\\" to plan their next attack on Trump. Caputo added that left-wing \\"hit squads being trained all over this country\\" were preparing an armed insurrection after the 2020 presidential election, advising his listeners to \\"buy ammunition\\". He claimed that the shooting of a right wing protester in Portland had been \\"a drill\\". He continued, \\"You understand that they‚Äôre going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that‚Äôs where this is going.\\" He said his physical and mental health were deteriorating and he feared being alone, describing \\"shadows on the ceiling\\" in his apartment. On September 14, Caputo's hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, released an editorial calling for his removal, \\"(...) What‚Äôs lunacy is for paranoia and political calculations to be coloring the dissemination of scientific knowledge during a pandemic. Caputo‚Äôs ideas about managing a health crisis need to be put out to pasture.\\" On September 15, Caputo apologized to HHS staff and indicated he might soon be leaving the agency, possibly on medical leave, admitting \\"he had never read\\" one of the MMWRs. On September 16 he announced that he was taking a 60-day medical leave from his post \\"after consultation with President Trump and Secretary Azar.\\" Alexander was also said to be leaving. Two days after Alexander was ousted and Caputo went on leave, the CDC reversed its much-criticized statement saying that asymptomatic people who have been in close contact with a person infected with the coronavirus did not need to receive COVID-19 testing;Noah Weiland,Emails Detail Effort to Silence C.D.C. and Question Its Science, New York Times (September 18, 2020). the statement had been forced through at the direction of HHS leadership and the White House over the objections of scientists and without going through the usual CDC scientific review process.Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C. Testing Guidance Was Published Against Scientists' Objections, New York Times (September 18, 2020). == Investigation == Due to his time working on the Trump campaign and the fact that he previously worked for politicians in Russia, Caputo was contacted by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on May 9, 2017, as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The House Intelligence Committee requested Caputo come in and be interviewed voluntarily and submit to the committee relevant documents associated with its investigation. During a March 20, 2017, hearing, Representative Jackie Speier questioned FBI Director James Comey about Caputo, and cited employment with Gazprom and history in Ukraine. Caputo worked with the House Intelligence Committee to respond to queries. Posting to social media, Caputo denied ties to Russia while on the Trump campaign. Caputo told the House Intelligence Committee: \\"The only time the President and I talked about Russia was in 2013, when he simply asked me in passing what it was like to live there in the context of a dinner conversation.\\" In May 2016, Caputo and Roger Stone had met with Henry Greenberg (a.k.a. Henry Oknyansky), a Russian national who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Caputo later denied contact with Russian officials or having discussed Russia with Trump or with other campaign aides. Caputo said in June 2017 that it was not until prosecutors informed him that Greenberg was Russian that he learned the man he had spoken with in 2016 was not a U.S. citizen. Caputo hired attorney Dennis Vacco to represent him during the investigation, and subsequently stated that he had liquidated his children's college funds to pay Vacco. ==Personal life== While working in Russia in the 1990s, Caputo met and married a Russian student studying astrophysics; their marriage ended in a divorce. Caputo became a Catholic in 2000, later saying this religious change helped him find peace. While advising in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2007, Caputo met Maryna Ponomarenko, who became his second wife. As of 2016, Caputo resided in East Aurora, New York, with his wife and their two children. On September 24, 2020, a spokesman for Caputo's family announced that he had been diagnosed with metastatic head and neck cancer which originated in his throat. ==See also== *Vladimir Gusinsky *Mikhail Lesin *New York Republican primary, 2016 *The Plot to Hack America *Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections *Timeline of post-election transition following Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections *Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (January‚ÄìJune 2018) *Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016 ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * PoliticsNY.net‚ÄîCaputo's political news site * Health and Human Services biography Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:American campaign managers Category:American political commentators Category:American Roman Catholics Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:People associated with the 2016 United States presidential election Category:United States Army soldiers Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services officials Category:Trump administration personnel Category:People from East Aurora, New York Category:People with cancer ","title":"Michael Caputo"},{"id":"54250503","text":"South Park is an unincorporated community in Turkey Creek Township, Kosciusko County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== South Park is located on the shores of Lake Wawasee, at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kosciusko County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"South Park, Indiana"},{"id":"54250508","text":"BioCurious is a community biology laboratory and nonprofit organization located in Sunnyvale, California, co-founded by Eri Gentry, Kristina Hathaway, Josh Perfetto, Raymond McCauley, Joseph Jackson, and Tito Jankowski.

Though she had limited schooling, she was the first American woman to rebel against discrimination towards women in industry, refusing to accept a woman's pay rate after doing a man's job. Greene was also an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. She died in 1900. ==Early years and education== Louisa Morton Willard was born in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, May 23, 1819. She is a descendant from sturdy New England ancestors. Her father, Henry Willard. blacksmith and farmer, removed from Vermont and settled in Ashburnham in the early years of the present century. Bereft of both parents in early childhood, she was deprived of schooling and thrown upon her own resources at the age of 13. ==Career== She obtained employment in a woolen factory in Dedham, Massachusetts, and worked for several years for the pittance of US$1.00 to $2.00 per week and board, working 14 hours a day. There, upon the heads of bobbins, she learned to write. Notwithstanding her long hours of labor, she found time for constant improvement by reading and study. Her habits of strict economy enabled her to save a portion of her wages, and at the age of 17 she had $150.00 in the bank. Then came her first revolt against the injustice shown to women in industrial pursuits. Gross discrimination in the matter of wages was made, simply on the ground of sex. Called upon at one time to take a man's place at a spindle, she performed her duties well and to the satisfaction of her employer. When pay-day came around and she demanded the same compensation that the man had been securing, her request was received with amazement. The plucky young girl stood her ground and refused to return to the spindle unless paid at the same rate as the man whose place she was filling. She was promptly dismissed from the factory, to be recalled a few weeks later at a higher rate of pay. In 1840, she taught school near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There, she formed the acquaintance of Jonas Greene, of Maine, and they married in 1841. Mr. Greene subsequently became a prominent politician, representing his district in each branch of the State legislature for several successive terms. His success in life he ascribed largely to the cooperation and support of his wife. Removing with her husband to the then somewhat sparsely settled Oxford County, Maine, a new and active life opened for her. While performing faithfully her duties, she found time to enter into the philanthropic and reform work of the times. Early becoming a convert to the Water cure system of treating the sick, she familiarized herself with it and soon developed a remarkable ability for the care and treatment of the sick. Physicians and medicines were unknown in her household, and her skill was in demand in the community. In 1850, Greene began to espouse the anti- slavery cause. She and others gathered women together and organized anti- slavery societies. Literature was distributed, Uncle Tom's Cabin was read, and she wrote many articles for the local papers. During the American Civil War, Greene's patriotic labors were untiring. When hospital supplies were needed, she collected, prepared and forwarded them. Greene's newspaper contributions for years covered a wide range of subjects. She was an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. In 1869, she removed with her family to Manassas, Virginia, where her husband died in 1873. With advancing years, Greene withdrew from active philanthropic work. She died March 5, 1900. ==References== Attribution * Bibliography * * ==External links== * Category:19th-century American writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:1819 births Category:1900 deaths Category:People from Ashburnham, Massachusetts Category:American social reformers Category:American suffragists Category:American temperance activists Category:American abolitionists Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century Category:Activists from Massachusetts Category:People from Dedham, Massachusetts ","title":"Louisa Morton Greene"},{"id":"54250732","text":"Kan Thiranthathu () is a 1959 Indian Tamil-language film directed by K.

It was obviously a blast to record it as well\\". All About Jazz reviewer John Kelman said, \\"A combination of original music and one relatively obscure Latin cover, Music We Are brings three friends together for a recording that, hopefully, signifies the beginning of a longer-term partnership\\". PopMatters Will Layman said, \\"This is not really a classic jazz trio record. It‚Äôs much better than that. This new band, let us fervently hope, has much great music ahead of it. It is a more- than-worthy successor to the great Jack DeJohnette bands of the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s, and Music We Are stands as the most complete and powerful compositional statement from the great drummer in over a decade. Which is say: wow\\". In Jazzwise, Stuart Nicholson wrote, \\"DeJohnette, Patitucci and Perez each possess an impressive CV that speaks of years of music making at the highest level of their profession and perhaps the most refreshing thing about this collection is that nobody feels the need to prove anything ‚Äì that they are the fastest, the quickest, the most technically gifted, the most harmonically clever. They could do, but they don‚Äôt. Instead, they get inside the music, teasing it this way and that without feeling the inner necessity to flaunt their ‚Äúsupergroup‚Äù credentials\\". The Guardians John Fordham stated, \\"DeJohnette is setting himself ever more fascinating rhythmic puzzles without compromising his awesome powers to push and swing ‚Äì and this set on his own label couples those resources to a free improv, world music and at times semi- classical agenda that might surprise a few of his regular admirers. ... at its best, Music We Are sounds intriguingly like 21st-century Thelonious Monk music, a jazzy Gamelan band, or the work of a free-improvising Herbie Hancock.

His girlfriend, then 17 year-old Michelle Carter, was accused of encouraging him in text messages to commit suicide. The case was the subject of a notable investigation and involuntary manslaughter trial in Massachusetts, colloquially known as the \\"texting suicide case\\". Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter involved scores of text messages, emails, and phone calls recorded between Carter and Roy in the leadup to his death. Roy had seen numerous mental health professionals, and he insisted that he wanted to die. Carter and Roy had both been prescribed psychiatric medication. The case raised questions pertaining to the nature and limits of criminal responsibility. Judge Moniz inferred that Carter wanted Roy dead and that her words coerced him to kill himself, a position that has been subject to some criticism. Carter was convicted by the judge of involuntary manslaughter, chiefly on the basis of her final phone call in which she ordered Roy, after he had become scared, to go back inside his truck as it filled with lethal carbon monoxide. == Conrad's mental health and relationship with Michelle== Roy was born in 1995 in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. He was sometimes socially anxious attending school and going into the classroom. For several years he worked with his father, grandfather, and uncle in his family's marine salvage business, Tucker-Roy Marine Towing and Salvage, Inc. in the New England area. In the Spring of 2014 he earned his captain's license from the Northeast Maritime Institute by completing three months of night classes. In June 2014 he graduated on the Honor Roll (highest grades) from Old Rochester Regional High School (ORR) in Mattapoisett. He was an all-around high school athlete who played baseball, rowed crew, and ran track. He graduated with a 3.88 GPA and was accepted to Fitchburg State University to study business, but at that point decided not to go. Carter was born on August 11, 1996, in Massachusetts to Gail and David Carter. She went to King Philip Regional High School, Wrentham. She had developed an eating disorder from the age of 8 or 9, may have injured herself by cutting, was on prescription psychiatric medication from the age of 14, and attended counselling at McLean Hospital in Belmont. Carter and Conrad Roy met in Florida in 2012 while each had been visiting relatives. After this initial encounter, they saw each other in person again only a handful of times over the course of two years, despite having lived only about away from each other in the Boston suburbs. Instead, they mostly exchanged text messages and emails. While much of the media routinely referred to Carter as Roy's girlfriend, this was a description used by Carter, not by Roy. He considered her a friend.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-by-text-the-case-against-michelle- carter/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/michelle-carter-i-love-you-now- die.html According to court documents, Roy had allegedly been physically hit by his father and verbally abused by his grandfather, and tried to kill himself in October 2012 while despondent after his parents had divorced. After learning that he was planning to kill himself, Carter repeatedly discouraged him from attempting suicide in 2012 and 2014 and encouraged him to \\"get professional help\\". However, her attitude changed in July 2014, when she started thinking that it would be a \\"good thing to help him die\\". In June, Roy had texted Carter suggesting they act like Romeo and Juliet, checking that she understood they had each killed themselves. Roy struggled with social anxiety and depression for which he had seen several therapists and counselors, including a cognitive behavioral therapist in the weeks prior to his death. He had been hospitalized for an acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose at the age of 17; he was talking to a girl he had met in a group and she called the police. He had been taking Celexa for some time. In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. In 2016 the judge had refused the defense's request for funds to hire an expert on Celexa, describing it as 'speculative'. Videos that Roy made of himself talking to a camera formed an important part of the case. == Roy's death == On Sunday, July 13, 2014, following digital exchanges with Carter while interacting with his family, Roy died by suicide by poisoning himself with carbon monoxide fumes in his truck in a Kmart parking lot in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Roy's funeral was held on Saturday, July 19, 2014, at St. Anthony's Church in Mattapoisett. The Captain Conrad H. Roy III Scholarship Fund at the Northeast Maritime Institute in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, was established in his memory. == Court proceedings == Michelle Carter was indicted on February 4, 2015, and arraigned the following day in New Bedford Juvenile Court in Taunton, Massachusetts on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The grand jury found enough to charge her with \\"wantonly and recklessly\\" assisting the suicide. She was 17 at the time and the court indicted her as a 'youthful offender' rather than a 'juvenile', meaning she could be sentenced as an adult. In June 2015, a district court judge denied a defense motion to remove the Bristol County District Attorney's office from the prosecution. The defense argued that DA Thomas M. Quinn III should be removed because he is first cousin to Roy's grandmother Janice Roy and therefore Conrad's first cousin twice removed. However, Quinn had already handed the case over to his Deputy DA William McCauley. On July 1, 2016 an appeal to the grand jury indictment heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was also denied, allowing the case to go forward. Justice Robert J. Cordy, writing for the unanimous court, found there was probable cause to sustain the manslaughter indictment.. On Monday, June 5, 2017, the day before the trial was scheduled to begin, Carter waived her right to jury trial. Therefore, the case was heard by Judge Lawrence Moniz in the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts, in Taunton. Carter was represented by Joseph P. Cataldo and Cory Madera. As there was limited legal precedent for prosecuting the encouragement of suicide, Cataldo initially asked a Taunton Juvenile Court judge for summary dismissal, arguing that Carter's texts were protected under the First Amendment and that the text history showed that Roy had been contemplating suicide without Carter's input. The judge declined this motion. On June 16, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz of the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts in Taunton found Carter guilty of involuntary manslaughter. He stated prior to his ruling that it was Carter's phone calls with Roy when he was in his truck gassing himself (as described by Carter's texts to friends), rather than the preceding text messages, that caused him to go through with killing himself. Judge Moniz found that Roy had broken the ‚Äúchain of self-causation‚Äù towards his suicide when he exited the truck and that it was Carter's wanton and reckless encouragement to then return to the truck that caused his death. After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the CBS 48 Hours show, saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that she knew exactly what she was doing. Carter remained free on bail pending her sentencing. On August 3, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz sentenced Carter to serve a two-and-a-half-year term, with 15 months to be served in the Bristol County House of Corrections, the rest of the balance suspended, and five years of probation to be served. Soon after the sentencing was handed down, Carter's lawyers asked Judge Moniz to issue a stay of the sentence until all of Carter's Massachusetts court appeals options are exhausted. Judge Moniz granted the stay with conditions that Carter stay away from the Roy family. On February 6, 2019, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Carter acted with criminal intent when she encouraged Roy into suicide, so her involuntary manslaughter conviction was ordered to stand and that Carter's 15-month prison sentence would be enforced in the near future. The rest of the 2¬Ω-year sentence was suspended, followed by five years of probation. Under order from a Massachusetts judge, Carter began serving her 15 month sentence on February 11, 2019. Carter had requested a parole hearing for early release, but the parole board denied the request on September 20, 2019. Meanwhile, Carter's lawyers petitioned the case to the Supreme Court of the United States in July 2019 based upon First Amendment and Fifth Amendment grounds. Carter's defense lawyers argued that Roy had a history of suicide attempts and the decision to end his life was his own, that Carter was \\"bewildered\\" over the case against her, and that, \\"Taking all the texts in context, she tried to talk him out of it... .\\" They argued in initial hearings that the defendant had broken no law and had a first amendment right to free speech, and that at that time she was a juvenile. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January 2020, leaving in place the Massachusetts Supreme Court conviction. On January 23, 2020, Carter was released early from prison due to good conduct. ==Legal repercussions== The case was expected by some to set a legal precedent, regarding, as Ray Sanchez and Natisha Lance of CNN put it, \\"whether it's a crime to tell someone to commit suicide.\\" Sanchez and Lance also stated that \\"The ruling... may spur lawmakers to codify the behavior highlighted in the case as criminal.\\" The judge had noted that Carter had willed Roy's death, that she did not order him out of the truck and that her actions \\"put him in that toxic environment\\" which \\"constituted reckless conduct\\" and \\"that the conduct caused the death of Mr. Roy.\\" While U.S. law does not allow the lower-court decision to bind other courts, legal professionals believe it could have a social effect by raising other courts' attention to new, digital methods of committing crimes. The case also attempts to redefine the social spectrum in which attitudes and behaviors would qualify as criminal that were not considered criminal before. ==In media== On September 23, 2018, Lifetime released a telefilm entitled Conrad & Michelle: If Words Could Kill which stars Austin P. McKenzie as Conrad Roy and Bella Thorne as Michelle Carter. A Dateline NBC episode regarding the case, entitled Reckless, aired on NBC on February 8, 2019. In addition to covering the court proceedings of Carter's conviction, Dateline correspondent Andrea Canning interviewed both the prosecution and defense attorneys, along with Conrad Roy's family members. On July 9, 2019, HBO released a two-part documentary on the case called I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth Vs. Michelle Carter, which explores the complicated relationship between Carter and Roy, drawing on some of the thousands of texts they exchanged over two years to chronicle their courtship and its tragic consequences. The film premiered at South by Southwest 2019, and was directed and produced by Erin Lee Carr. The same week as the documentary release, Carter's lawyers submitted a petition to the Supreme Court to consider her encouragement to commit suicide as protected free speech. Constitutional law scholar Eugene Volokh was reported as saying he did not expect the justices to take the case. The court declined to take up the case in January 2020. On August 15, 2019, it was announced that Universal Cable Productions was developing a television series inspired by the case, with documentarian Erin Lee Carr and journalist Jesse Barron serving as consulting producers. On August 7, 2020 Variety reported that Elle Fanning would be starring as Michelle Carter and the series would be titled The Girl From Plainville which would be on Hulu. == See also == * Assisted suicide * Complicity * Social media and suicide * Suicide pact * Suicide of Megan Meier * William Francis Melchert-Dinkel * Suicide of Phoebe Prince == References  External links == * Obituary page for Captain Conrad H.

It is taught as an accredited part of higher education. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a university faculty. That person will be accredited by learned societies to which he or she belongs along with the academic journals in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline. Disciplines vary between universities and even programs. These will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. Most disciplines are broken down into (potentially overlapping) branches called sub- disciplines. There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether anthropology and linguistics are disciplines of social sciences or fields within the humanities). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate. ==Humanities and social science==  Anthropology  * Anthropological criminology * Anthropological

In some areas, it is said that a \\"mizu-itachi\\" (water weasel) within ponds are hitogitsune. Though it has \\"itachi\\" in its name, they are said to be much smaller than real weasels and stay in a large willow of the pond, and several of them would all make a bustle at once. In the Shimane Prefecture, hitogitsune are considered to be smaller tha a normal fox. Hitogitsune would enter people's bodies and make them ill, and when that person dies, they would bite a hole in that person's belly or back to go outside; it is said that the dead one's body would have a black hole in it somewhere. Families possessed by a hitogitsune are called \\"hitogitsune-mochi\\" (those that have hitogitsune) and it is said that those that are hated by this family would get possessed by one of their hitogitsune. It is said that those possessed by a hitogitsune become pretty much the hitogitsune itself, and through the hitogitsune, they would talk about various things with families that have hitogitsune, walk on all fours like a fox, and like to eat food that foxes like to eat. When someone from a family that has hitogitsune marries, 75 hitogitsune would attack the other family, so families that had hitogitsune tended to be treated coldly and marriages with them tended to be avoided. Also, families that have hitogitsune would grow wealthy as a result of the hitogitsune carrying back riches, but if someone of the family mistreats the hitogitsune, the fortunes of the family, no matter how rich they were, would immediately decline. Furthermore, it is said that anyone who buys the assets of a family that falls to ruin like this would also be attacked by hitogitsune. No matter how presgegious the family, if they ever even get rumored to have hitogitsune, other people would distance themselves from them, leading them to hardship. \\"Kudagitsune\\" from the Sh≈çzan Chomon Kish≈´ by Miyoshi Sh≈çzan In the Tottori Prefecture, families possessed by a fox are called \\"kitsune-zoru,\\" and the foxes that possess such families are called \\"hitogitsune.\\" It is said that around such a family, 75 kin of the fox would be playing around, and that its true identity was a male weasel.

It was written by Mike McMahan and directed by Juan Meza-Leon. The season three premiere first aired unannounced on Adult Swim in the United States on April 1, 2017 when it was watched by 676,000 American households. On the first day of its original broadcast, \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" was replayed every half hour from 8pm to 12am ET with improved ratings, as a part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' Day joke. The episode follows the events surrounding Rick Sanchez's incarceration at the Galactic Federation's prison and high-stakes bid to escape, with revelations that both reveal his true motives and character. Following its initial airing, \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" received positive reviews, which generally favored the episode's character development and its surprise turn of events. == Plot == During Rick Sanchez's incarceration, the Galactic Federation has colonized Earth and the Smith family attempts to cope with his absence. Summer exhumes the remains of alternate Rick in their backyard, intending to use his portal gun and rescue him. Morty, however, attempts to reveal Rick's shortcomings to Summer by taking her to his original dimension -- now a universe where Earth has been transformed into a wasteland by a virus turning all humans to hideous monsters as a consequence of Rick's carelessness (referred to as \\"the Cronenberg World\\"). All the while, Galactic Federation scientists attempt to discover the secret to Rick's portal gun by sending alien Cornvelious Daniel into his mind to interrogate him, using mental images from his past. Morty and Summer are captured by the Smith family of the Cronenberg World, but are saved by SEAL Team Ricks, who send the two to the Council of Ricks. Upon learning that Rick was captured, Seal Team Ricks announce their plan to dispatch a team to assassinate him. At the prison, Rick deceives the Galactic Federation into believing he divulged the secrets of his portal gun. With their guard lowered, Rick hacks into Federation technology to switch bodies with his captors. His actual body is shot by a member of SEAL Team Ricks, who arrive at his holding area unaware that he is still alive. Rick transfers his consciousness into one of the SEAL Team Ricks and kills the others. He infiltrates the Citadel of Ricks, and manages to teleport the station into the same space as the Federation prison. This propels both sides into a massive battle; Rick then uses the ensuing chaos to rescue Morty and Summer and kill the Council of Ricks. In the confusion, Rick enters the Federation mainframe‚Äî-revealed to be his reason for turning himself in. He uses this access to make the galactic currency worthless, thereby destroying the Federation's economy. The Galactic Federation falls into chaos and collapses as a result, with the aliens leaving Earth. Heralded a hero by Summer and Beth, Rick returns to the Smith household where Jerry issues Beth an ultimatum: choose him or Rick. Rick, Summer and Morty step away to the garage rather than participate in the impending argument. A short while later, Beth announces she is leaving Jerry. As the new status quo is established and Rick is left alone with Morty, he reveals to Morty that his ulterior motive was to make both the Galactic Federation and Jerry \\"go away\\", punishing Jerry for his betrayal by threatening to turn him in to the government in the second-season finale and ensuring his role as Morty's de facto male influence. This devolves into Rick going on a monologue, in homage to his rant at the conclusion of the pilot episode, about how their adventures are bound to be darker than before. Rick also professes his passion for the Szechuan Sauce once available at McDonald's as a promotional item for the 1998 film Mulan, much to Morty's confusion. In the post-credits scene, Tammy observes Birdperson's resurrection as a cyborg dubbed \\"Phoenix Person\\". == Production == \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" was written by staff team member Mike McMahan. Elements of the episode were loosely inspired by the film The Shawshank Redemption and features the series' trademark dark humor, nihilism, and multiverse-based plot line. In a segment for the Den of Geek website, series creator Dan Harmon said \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" would resolve the conflicts that originated from the second season. According to Harmon: \\"I don't think anybody wants to do a third season that simply spends a whole bunch of episodes dealing with a situation that we created at the end of the second season, so I think that's a non-spoiler way of saying things should be okay pretty quickly\\". The episode marks the reappearance of several former key plot developments, including the Cronenberg universe, the Citadel of Ricks, and Birdperson. The third-season premiere of Rick and Morty was expected to arrive as early as 2016. However, Harmon admitted in a conversation with Indiewire that new episodes were becoming more difficult to create because of artistic disagreements with co-creator Justin Roiland. Writing for \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" commenced on November 2, 2015; a few months later in February 2016, episode director Juan Meza-Leon began work for the project's sound recording. In February 2017, to celebrate the beginning of the episode's animation phase, Adult Swim Australia released a teaser trailer, later revealed to actually be a \\"RickRoll\\": a compilation of clips taken from seasons one and two that offered no new insight into the upcoming premiere. == Release and reception == \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" premiered on April 1, 2017, without any prior announcement at 8pm ET on Adult Swim. As a part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' joke, the premiere was broadcast for four straight hours, interrupting the television network's scheduled new episodes of Samurai Jack and Dragon Ball Super. It was watched by 676,000 American households and had a 0.2 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. By 11pm, as details of the episode's unexpected debut spread, \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" had its best showing with 949,000 viewers and a 0.4 rating. A critical success, \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" was praised as one of the series' best episodes, with Jesse Schedeen of IGN saying it was \\"keeping the level of quality high\\". Critics cited the episode's dark undertones and unique insight into Rick's psyche. IGN's Jesse Schedeen wrote in his review \\"Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon managed to craft a conflict that was hilarious, darkly poignant and completely unlike anything fans were expecting\\". He also praised the episode's ability to defy expectations while offering \\"a grim portrait of a mad scientist who hates everyone else almost as much as he hates himself\\". Zach Blumenfeld of Paste called \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" the \\"top of all animated television\\", an episode that saw deeper character development and humor that rivaled \\"Total Rickall\\" and \\"Meeseeks and Destroy\\". Den of Geek writer Joe Matar observed \\"previous Rick and Morty plot developments, reminding us of the show‚Äôs commitment to its persistent multiverse\\" in a premiere he considered as the series' best. ==See also== * Adult Swim April Fools' Day stunts == References External links== * Category:2017 American television episodes Category:Rick and Morty episodes ","title":"The Rickshank Rickdemption"},{"id":"54251277","text":"Birsha Munda Memorial College, established in 2010, is a general degree college at Pirrah, Haludkanali, Bankura district, India.

Considered as an original thinker, he is also described as \\"disorganised, despondent and a ditherer\\". He is known as a friend of Christopher North. ==Background== He was the son of Alexander Blair (1737‚Äìc.1816), a manufacturer and merchant in the Birmingham area, and brother of the writer and historian Mary Margaret Busk. Their mother was Mary Johnson. The elder Alexander Blair was an army officer, who in 1780 went into partnership with James Keir at Tipton. They made alloy window sashes, and alkali, and the venture became a successful soap manufacturer. The business with Keir included a coal mine. Blair also set up a business making masts, and bought land in the Canadian Maritimes.Eileen Curran, Holding on by a Pen: The Story of a Lady/Reviewer Mary Margaret Busk (1779‚Äì1863), Victorian Periodicals Review Vol. 31, No. 1, Victorian Women Editors and Critics (Spring, 1998), pp. 9‚Äì30, at pp. 11‚Äì3. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals. In later life he encountered financial problems. Blair became a proprietor of the Royal Institution. Socially, he knew James Boswell and Joseph Priestley, and was connected to the Lunar Society by his acquaintance. He was a nonconformist, and in politics followed Charles James Fox. He had heard of Keir's work on alkalis from William Irvine, the Glasgow chemist. Mary Johnson, wife of Alexander Blair the elder, was the daughter of Alexander Johnson of The Hague. Johnson was a military agent there, and involved in litigation around 1770, when James Boswell acted as his lawyer. Alexander Johnson was brother to Richard Johnson (1753‚Äì1807), whose financial problems compounded those of the Blairs. ==Life== Alexander Blair, the younger, was born with a twin brother Richard. He was brought up in London and Birmingham, before being sent to boarding school. He attended Glasgow University, where he studied languages and philosophy. There he met John Wilson, a long-term friend. Blair was a partner in the Tipton family business, with his father and Richard, the partnership being dissolved in 1815. From 1830 to 1836 he was Professor of English and Rhetoric at London University, successor to Thomas Dale who had first held the chair. As a man of letters he did not thrive in the philological atmosphere promoted by colleagues Thomas Hewitt Key and George Long, and resigned the post. Blair was a friend of Thomas Wright Hill, and also of Samuel Carter, a Coventry lawyer and a younger man. Hugh Carter, son of Samuel, painted his portrait. ==Works== Blair wrote for Blackwood's Magazine. In 1824 he attacked the idea of the encyclopedia in Blackwood's, arguing that individual and specialised contributions were what advanced knowledge. He doubted whether the \\"circle of the sciences\\" could actually be grasped. Specialised encyclopedias were appearing at the period, such as the Encyclopaedia, or Dictionary of Music (1825) by John Feltham Danneley.Richard Yeo, Lost Encyclopedias: Before and after the Enlightenment, Book History Vol. 10 (2007), pp. 47‚Äì68. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834 (1836) was illustrated by Francis Ronalds. It recorded an archaeological survey of the ancient Carnac stones. Following it, Blair suffered from depression, which played a part in his resignation from his chair.

The film stars Tovino Thomas as a criminal on the run and Aishwarya Lekshmi as an aspiring actress. Their troubled love and struggle for survival form the basic plot of the film. It released on 22 December 2017 to widespread positive reviews from critics. The film was in several \\"Top films of the year lists\\" compiled by various medias and film journals.The film is a smooth flow of realistic emotions. == Plot == John Mathew (Tovino Thomas) is an orphan, living as a thug. He participates in an undercover deal on behalf of his boss, who is busy with his daughter's schooling. Mathew convinces his group that their boss is intentionally pulling out of the deal due to the risk involved. However, they reach the hotel without any issue. While Mathew is taking a bath, three police officers disguised as civilians enter the rooms and kill the accompanying three gang members. Mathew hides in the tub, and during his escape, he accidentally kills an officer. He reaches Kochi and moves in with his ex-boss and longtime friend Shaji. Mathew intends to settle abroad with his ex-girlfriend \\"Appu\\" Aparna (Aishwarya Lekshmi), who is an aspiring actress and is auditioning for a role. In this, she is helped by her ex-roommate Sameera (Leona Lishoy), who is now a successful actress. Aparna is also making a livelihood as an anchor for parties and other events. Mathew suggests his plans to settle abroad using the money that he got from the deal. However, she refuses to move out with him as she believes that Mathew stole it. She gets an offer for an ad shoot and travels to Kasaragod. Mathew accompanies her on the trip. Mathew's boss is taken into custody, and he provides details on Mathew. He asks the officers to kill him and keep the looted money for themselves. The police hunt Mathew and locate him as being in contact with a lady (Aparna). They find her at a mall in Kochi, and an officer introduces himself as Mathew's classmate, enquiring about his whereabouts. Aparna denies being in contact with him, and Mathew eavesdrops on the conversation. Later, Shaji asks him to leave his home. Planning to have a final word with Aparna, he meets her at Sameera's apartment. Aparna never relents to his plans, and Mathew decides to move on. Aparna is interrogated by the police while at a diner, and she reveals being in contact with Mathew. Mathew is called for and caught, but the policemen intend to kill him rather than take him to court. Mathew tries convincing one officer to no avail. He is taken to a forest, and the officer lies to him that Aparna plotted the call intending him to be caught. Mathew replies that she was right in doing so and says that he loves her very much. He is then shot by one of the policemen (Senthil) and succumbs to his wounds. The last scene, set some time in the future, shows Aparna, oblivious to Mathew‚Äôs death, getting her first shot as an actress and waiting for her first film, still living with a hope that Mathew will come back. == Cast == * Tovino Thomas as John Mathew aka Maathan * Aishwarya Lekshmi as Aparna Ravi aka Appu * Leona Lishoy as Sameera * Harish Uthaman as Harish * Ilavarasu as Police Inspector *Jayakumar as Senthil * Nizhalgal Ravi as Police Inspector *Darshana Rajendran as Darshana * Maya Menon as Vasumathi * Unnimaya Prasad as Assistant Director * Khalid Rahman as Assistant Director * Lijo Jose Pellissery as Director Len Prasad (Extended Cameo) * Basil Joseph as Director Jinu (Cameo) * Soubin Shahir as Sameera's Ikka (Cameo) * Aparna Balamurali as Herself (Cameo) * Shine Tom Chacko (Cameo) ==Production== The film is jointly scripted by Dileesh Nair and Syam Pushkaran both of whom have previously associated with Aashiq Abu in several films. The seed for the film came from director-cinematographer Amal Neerad, a friend of Aashiq and Syam. Neerad narrated in one of their meetings something that he had heard while living in Bombay. Neerad himself had initially wanted to direct the story for his short film in the 5 Sundarikal anthology. But later he put it on hold and proceeded with another script. Syam adapted Neerad's story to a more familiar surrounding for Mayaanadhi. Tovino Thomas was announced as the male lead for the film in February 2017. Aashiq wanted to cast a new face as the female lead and model-turned-actress Aishwarya Lekshmi was selected through audition. Aishwarya had already debuted in films early in the year playing the female lead in Njandukalude Nattil Oridavela. According to Aishwarya she never had to put any extra effort for portraying the role as the director and script writers would brief situations well. Cast includes Aparna Balamurali and Leona Lishoy. The shooting of the film started in May 2017 .The first schedule was shot in Madurai and Kodaikanal and second leg of shooting was completed at Kochi. Other locations include Bakel and Dhanushkodi. == Release == The film released in 87 theaters across Kerala on 22 December 2017. == Reception ==  Critical response  Upon release, it received wide critical acclaim from various film critics and was voted among the best Malayalam films of the year by The Hindu, The Indian Express, and International Business Times. G. Raghesh of Malayala Manorama has written that Aashiq Abu's craftsmanship as a filmmaker makes 'Mayaanadhi' a neatly narrated love story that has some of the most beautiful romantic moments Malayalam cinema has ever produced. Sudhi C. J. from the same newspaper wrote: \\"Mayaanadhi tugs at the heartstrings of viewers with the cinematic brilliance and excellence in craft displayed by Aashiq Abu, setting it apart from other contemporary films, most of which fail to leave an impression ‚Äì of either sadness, happiness or thought ‚Äì on the audience.\\" Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India has rated the film 3.5 of 5 stars and written that Aashiq Abu's 'Mayaanadhi' is a movie telling an intense story of urban characters without any superficiality. It's also a fine example on how two well fleshed out characters can take forward a film all on their own. Neelima Mohan of The News Minute has written that 'Mayaanadhi' is a modern romance with all its trappings‚Äîyet the intensity cannot be more searing which inverts traditional ideas of romance. S. R. Praveen of The Hindu said that 'Mayaanadhi' is Aashiq Abu's best yet and movie is a quite an absorbing watch. The movie is a Magic of love, life, and all in between. Aditya Shrikrishna of The New Indian Express wrote: \\"There is something about Mayaanadhi, Ashiq Abu‚Äôs new Malayalam film, that is as mystical as its title. The film seemingly gravitates between genres but keeps the tone intact. Mayaanadhi‚Äôs gaze, most sensitive gaze of all, doesn‚Äôt flinch. Two threads run in parallel, a manhunt widening in real time and a lived relationship uncovering its past. Never a false moment in its 136-minute run, Mayaanadhi begins like a thriller, sways into romance territory, and keeps jumping timelines and genres at will.\\" News and entertainment portal Sify has written that 'Mayaanadhi is the kind of film that goes straight into your heart and provides a variety of emotions. It's romantic, funny and moving. It's the kind of honest and realistic movie that is not to be missed. Abhijith from online entertainment portal Filmibeat.com has reviewed that 'Mayaanadhi' is pre-dominantly a love story and at the same time, it has some thrilling elements in it. Aashiq Abu has successfully switched sequences between these two different genres and never ever one would feel a mismatch. He has rated the movie 4 of 5. Anna MM Vetticad from media portal Firstpost has written that in 'Mayaanadhi' Aishwarya Lekshmi, Tovino Thomas headline the romance of the year from Mollywood. She has stated that 'Mayaanadhi' has its fine balance between being relatable and yet being an epic romance. It is a befitting December release in a year that has witnessed some great works from Malayalam cinema and has rated the movie 4 of 5. Rating the film 4 in a scale of 5, film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote: \\"We‚Äôve seen many falling-in-love films, many falling-out-of-love films. This is a being- in-love film, with all the passions and problems the term suggests.\\"Baradwaj Rangan (26 December 2017). \\"Mayaanadhi Movie Review\\". Filmcompanion.in. Retrieved 12 January 2018. Another critic Veeyen in a brilliant tribute to the film, states that \\"In ‚ÄòMayaanadhi, director Aashiq Abu, armed with a dexterously penned screenplay, settles down to sensitively sketch a doomed tale of love. An impeccable reconstruction of an age-old narrative in an untested realistic setting, ‚ÄòMayanadhi‚Äô is the kind of film that holds a depth of meanings in those abstract gazes, a profundity of emotions in those unuttered words, and which leaves an inexplicable, seething sting at the upshot of it all.\\" Similarities with Breathless Some critics have pointed out the film's plot similarities with the 1960 French film Breathless, written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard, which is about a wandering criminal (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American girlfriend (Jean Seberg). During the script development stage, Aashiq Abu had revealed that films like Breathless were a reference to Mayaanadhi. An article from International Business Times states: \\"Even though Mayaanadhi owes a great deal of its plot structure to Breathless, Aashiq Abu transforms and elevates the movie to a different level. He breaths fresh air and life into his protagonists, Matthan and Appu, and they stay with the viewers even after the movie's touching climax scene.\\" ==Soundtrack== The film's soundtrack is composed, programmed and arranged by Rex Vijayan. Vijayan along with Yakzan Gary Pereira and Neha Nair produced the background score of the film.

The park fills the west side of the \\"X\\" where the borders of Kazakhstan, Russia, China, and Mongolia meet. The highest peak in Siberia (Belukha Mountain, ), is on the Russian border in the Katun Range. The park is in Katonkaragay District of East Kazakhstan Region, southeast of the capital city of Astana. Created on June 1, 2001, the park was included in the transnational park \\"Altai\\" with Russia in 2011. In 2014, the park was included in the new \\"Katon-Karagay Biosphere Reserve\\", named by the UNESCO Man-and-Biosphere program. ==Topography== Situated on the slopes of the Southern Altai mountains, the park is mountainous and glaciated, with altitudes often reaching over . The park is bordered on the north by the Altai Republic of Russia, on the southeast by China, on the west by the Farpusnaya River, and on the south by the northern slopes of the Sarymsakty and Tarbagatai ranges of the Southern Altai Mountains. 34% of the park is forested, the remainder being mountain meadows or rocky slopes and glaciers. The slopes are steep, with terrain formed by the glaciers: trough-shaped valleys, cirques, and moraines. The glacier-fed rivers are steep and energetic. Kokkol Falls, at 80 meters, is the largest waterfall in the Altai Mountains. ==Ecoregion== The park is in the Altai alpine meadow and tundra and Altai steppe and semi-desert ecoregions. These ecoregions are exhibit the complete altitudinal vegetation zones from steppe to alpine tundra. These ecoregions exhibit very high diversity because they are at the biogeographic divide between Siberia to the north and the cold deserts of Central Asia to the south. ==Climate== The climate at mid-level altitudes is \\"Humid continental climate, cool summer subtype\\" (Koeppen Classification Dfb, with alpine climate (Koppen ET) above the treeline. Precipitation patterns are affected by the mountainous terrain and altitude zoning; lower elevations average 386 mm of precipitation per year (maximum in summer). Average temperature ranges from in January to in July. ==Plants and Animals== The vegetation is arrayed in four general altitude zones. * The nival zone, at elevations of 2,800 meters and above, supports small communities of lichen and alpine vegetation such as Snow Primrose and Altai Buttercup in the crevices and rocky edges of snowfields and glaciers. * The Tundra-mountain belt extends from 2,100 meters to 2,800 meters. It features mosses and lichens on the stones, shrubs and grassy tundra, including Altai bluegrass and Honeysuckle. * The Sub-alpine forest and mountain meadow zone extends from 1,200 to 2,300 meters. The most common trees are Siberian pine, larch, and birch. The meadows feature grasses, sedges, and blueberries. * The Mountain-forest, meadow-steppe zone is found below 1,200 meters. At this level are birch and larch-aspen forest, and widespread grasses and bushes. Scientists have recorded 363 species of vertebrates in the park: 284 birds, 65 mammals, 6 reptiles, 2 amphibians, and 6 species of fish. Common mammals are common and tundra shrew, wolf, fox, roe deer and brown bear. ==Tourism== There are visitor accommodations in the nearby settlements. 24% of the park (1,512 km2) is zoned as a strict nature reserve, the other 76% (4,922 km2) is zoned for recreation, scientific study, and restricted economic activity. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Topographic map of the area Category:National parks of Kazakhstan Category:East Kazakhstan Region ","title":"Katon-Karagay National Park"},{"id":"54251320","text":"Duo (London) 1993 is a live album featuring performances by saxophonists Anthony Braxton and Evan Parker which was recorded at the Bloomsbury Theatre as part of the 1993 London Jazz Festival and released on the Leo label.Leo Records: album entry accessed June 6, 2017Anthony Braxton discography accessed June 6, 2017Enciclopedia del Jazz: Anthony Braxton accessed June 6, 2017Evan Parker discography accessed June 6, 2017 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick stated \\"A live duo performance by musicians of this extraordinarily high caliber occasionally results in something incredible but perhaps more often describes a battle of egos with neither side giving in.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a white flower with prominent dark green stripes and a brown-tipped dorsal sepal with a thread-like tip. Mainland striped greenhoods were formerly described as Pterostylis alata but that species is now recognised as a Tasmanian endemic. ==Description== Pterostylis striata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of between five and nine dark green, wrinkled leaves, long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide borne on a spike high with three to five spreading stem leaves. The flowers are white with dark green stripes and a brownish tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea and have erect, thread- like tips long and a flat sinus with a small groove between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide, straight and just visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from May to August. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis striata was first formally described in 1877 by Robert FitzGerald from a specimen found near Yass. Fitzgerald published the description in his book Australian Orchids. Plants in this species were formerly described as Pterostylis alata but that species is now recognised as a Tasmanian endemic. The State Herbarium of South Australia still lists Pterostylis alata as occurring in that state. ==Distribution and habitat== The mainland striped greenhood grows in a range of habitats from tea-tree scrub to forest and is widespread in Victoria. In New South Wales it is found south from Orange. ==References== striata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1877 ","title":"Pterostylis striata"},{"id":"54251396","text":"Swami Dhananjoy Das Kathiababa Mahavidyalaya, established in 2009, is the general degree college in Bhara village, Bankura district.

Grey was the fourth son of Edward Grey, bishop of Hereford while his mother was the daughter of James Croft of Greenham Lodge, near Newbury, Berkshire. Grey studied at Christ Church, Oxford, but did not complete studies and joined the war office as a clerk. Nominated to work in the Bengal civil service he entered Haileybury College in January 1839 and passed out in July 1840. During his first term, he was rusticated for late night parties in his room but made up for it in later terms. He went to Bengal in 1840 and worked for a while in various offices before becoming a private secretary to Sir Herbert Maddock in 1845. In 1851 he became secretary of the Bank of Bengal. He became a secretary to the government of Bengal in 1854. He went on furlough to England in January 1857 but was forced back by the rebellion in that year. He was appointed director general of the post office in 1859 after holding various temporary offices. In 1861 he became a member of the council of the governor-general of Bengal. In 1867 he became lieutenant-governor of Bengal. As an administrator, he opposed excessive centralization and helped decentralise the postal department. He opposed the application of income-tax rules in India. He often held opposing views to those of the governor-general Sir John Lawrence. He felt that the use of land cess to support education was unjust to the landholders. His position did not find favour with Lord Mayo. He was made Knight Commander of The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India in the 1870 Birthday Honours. He retired in 1871 and returned to England. In 1874 he accepted a position of governor in Jamaica. He died at Torquay on 15 May 1878. He was married first in 1845 to Margaret n√©e Jackson and after her death in 1862 he married again in 1865 to Georgina n√©e Plowden.

These agreements are made in order to accommodate foreign workers who pay FICA taxes but receive no Social Security or Medicare benefits after reaching age 65. The agreements are made between the U.S. and other individual countries, and govern international taxpayers who earn money in the U.S. The goal of totalization agreements is to eliminate dual taxation on a foreigner's income made in the U.S. as well as provide proportional Social Security benefits for the same foreign workers. Issues considered to determine if a worker is covered under either Social Security and Medicare in the United States, or the social security system in a foreign country include where the worker resides and whether the employment in a foreign country is short-term or long-term. As of August 2017, the U.S. has 26 active totalization agreements. ==FICA tax== In 1935, Congress passed the Social Security Act. The act established a taxpayer-funded old-age pension. In the 1960s, Congress established Medicare, which provides taxpayer-funded health insurance to the elderly. In order to finance Social Security and Medicare, Congress passed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, also known as FICA. Under FICA tax policy as of December 2017, the act mandates 3 different types of payroll taxes that employees have withheld from their paychecks: a 6.2% Social Security tax, a 1.45% Medicare tax, and, starting in 2013, a 0.9% Medicare tax for workers who make over $200,000 a year. Additionally, employers have to match any Social Security and Medicare taxes that their employees pay. All that totals to roughly a 12% Social Security tax and a 3% Medicare tax as a percentage of an employee's base paycheck. ==Purpose== A problem with the system of payroll taxes to fund old-age benefits is the effects of those taxes on foreign nationals. If someone from a foreign country works for a U.S. company in the U.S., that employee would have to pay FICA taxes. However, given that the worker is a foreign national, that worker is not eligible for U.S. old-age benefits, which only U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents are eligible for. That would be an unfair situation in that a foreign national would be paying into a system that they cannot derive benefit from. In addition, these nationals may also be subject to their home country's pension taxes, resulting in double taxation on the same income. Foreign residence can also result in gaps in pension benefits. The same problem of double taxation and a lack of benefits can also occur with U.S. citizens or permanent residents working abroad. Totalization agreements seek to remedy this problem of double taxation, as well as to fill in gaps in multiple country's old-age benefit programs. As of August 2017, the U.S. has entered into totalization agreements with 26 countries. ==General components== Totalization agreements that the U.S. enters into with other countries generally all have a few key components. Overall, totalization agreements eliminate dual social security coverage of workers in the U.S. and the other country they are from or work in. This involves exempting a worker from either the U.S. or the other country's taxation and benefits program. Many rules govern which nation's social security system covers a worker. One rule, the territoriality rule specifies that a worker is subject to the laws of the country in which he/she is working in. This rule is active in all U.S. agreements. Under this rule, a German citizen working and residing in the U.S. would pay FICA taxes and would eventually be eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits from the United States. Another rule, the detached-worker rule, governs foreign workers who are only temporarily stationed in the United States. A worker who has been temporarily transferred to work in the United States, for a period of up to five years, will remain subject to the social security system of his/her home country. This rule also applies if a worker goes from one foreign country to a different foreign country for an additional five years. The detached-worker rule is in all U.S. agreements with other countries except for its agreement with Italy. For example, if a worker from Germany is only temporarily stationed in the United States for a period of five years, that worker would not pay FICA taxes to the U.S. and would instead pay into the German social security system and eventually receive benefits from that system. Workers who are self-employed in a foreign country are also subject to totalization agreements. These workers are usually subject to social security coverage of their place of residence. For example, a self-employed U.S. citizen living in Sweden will be covered by the Swedish social security system. However, exceptions do exist with regards to this part of the system. Totalization agreements tolerate exceptions to the above rules in determining what social security system should govern a specific worker. If both countries agree to make an exception for an individual worker, then the country that agreed to cover the specific worker will accordingly cover that worker. An example of an exception would be if a short-term stay in a country was extended a few months over the five-year maximum allotted for the application of the detached-worker rule. An agreement between the two countries could be made to ignore the extra three months the worker spent in the foreign country. That would prevent the worker in question from being subject to taxes from the country he/she works in. Instead, that worker would continue to be subjected to the social security system of his/her home country. The U.S. determines what totalization benefits a foreign national can receive based on how long that foreign national has been in the country and how long that foreign national has worked in his/her home country. The U.S. has a threshold for the time needed to work in order to receive full Social Security and Medicare benefits. With countries it has entered into a totalization agreement with, the U.S. will count foreign time worked towards the threshold. If the combined total exceeds the threshold, the U.S. will then pay partial payments to the recipients. ==Comparison to foreign systems== While the United States uses tax treaties in order to manage the social security coverage with foreign nations, other regions of the world do things differently. For example, the European Union has a system in which workers may pay taxes to a multitude of member nations' systems. The system will then total all the contributions a worker made into the system. A worker will then be granted full social security benefits based on total contributions made throughout the continent. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Description of provisions in totalization agreements from the Social Security Administration *List of countries that have entered into totalization agreements with the United States as of August 3, 2017 Category:Tax treaties Category:Taxation in the United States Category:Social security in the United States Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States) ","title":"Totalization agreements"},{"id":"54251532","text":"Amanda L.

The 26 members of the STC include the governors of five southern governorates and two government ministers. It was formed by a faction of the Southern Movement, also known as al-Hirak al- Janoubi. The Southern Movement was established in 2007, during the term of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and it has called for and worked toward the separation of southern Yemen from the rest of the nation (as it previously was until 1990). Declared on 11 May 2017, the council is headed by the former Governor of Aden, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, as president, with former-minister of state Hani Bin Breik as vice-president. The formation of the council was authorized a week earlier by the Historic Aden Declaration announced at a rally protesting the dismissal of al-Zoubaidi from his post as governor. The STC claims to rule most of the territory in southern Yemen. ==History== On 27 April 2017, a presidential decree was given by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi dismissing Aidarus al-Zoubaidi from his post as governor of Aden, due to his close ties with the UAE whom President Hadi described as ‚Äúacting like occupiers‚Äù in the city . This was met with large demonstrations in the city in support of the deposed but popular Zoubaidi . With the help and support of the UAE, the STC was formed on 11 May 2017 with Aidarus al-Zoubaidi as its leader. Immediately, President Hadi called the council illegitimate. Territorial situation in Yemen in 2020. Beginning on 28 January 2018, separatists loyal to the STC seized control of the Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in a coup d'√©tat against the Hadi government. In January 2018, as the head of the STC, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi announced a state of emergency in Aden and that \\"the STC has begun the process of overthrowing Hadi‚Äôs rule over the South\\". On 27 August 2019, tensions continued to escalate in southern Yemen after the UAE- backed Security Belt Forces (SBF) lost territories to troops loyal to the Saudi-backed government of President Hadi. The troops advanced on the capital Aden and instead of engaging in street fighting, took positions outside of the city in order to prevent civilian casualties. On 29 August 2019, to stop government forces from advancing and reclaiming the capital, the UAE carried out airstrikes on government positions outside of Aden, which killed and injured over 300 government soldiers. Despite membership in the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, the UAE fell out with Hadi's government after the former accused Hadi of aligning with the Islah party, a powerful party, which it viewed as ideologically close to the Muslim Brotherhood. The STC declared self-governance on 26 April 2020. The government said local and security authorities in the provinces of Hadramawt, Abyan, Shabwa, al-Mahra, and the island of Socotra dismissed the move as a \\"clear and definite coup\\". In Aden, the movement's attempt was successful, as it occupied all governmental institutions.  STC Backing  The UAE helped create the SBF in southern Yemen. Since its formation, the SBF has played a crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition before the recent escalation. Its successes came in part due to being militarily backed by the UAE. The backing included training of SBF fighters in Abu Dhabi and the supply of military equipment. Emirati backing was crucial in helping the STC gain Aden, which has been under its control since 2018. ==See also== *Southern Movement *Yemeni Socialist Party *South Yemen insurgency ==References== Category:Arab separatism Category:Politics of Yemen Category:Yemeni Crisis (2011‚Äìpresent) Category:2017 establishments in Yemen ","title":"Southern Transitional Council"},{"id":"54251598","text":"Moses Sumney is an American singer-songwriter based in Asheville, North Carolina.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non- flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants lack a rosette at the base and have up to eighteen tiny green, white and brownish flowers. ==Description== Pterostylis rubescens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of between five and fifteen egg-shaped to heart-shaped leaves which lie flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants have between three and eighteen well-spaced flowers long are borne on a thin, wiry spike high. Three to six leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The flowers are almost spherical, green and white near the base, brownish near the tip and age to pinkish. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward near the top and has a rough tip. The lateral sepals are erect and held closely against the galea with narrow tips about long that do not project above the galea. The sinus between the bases of the lateral sepals bulges forward and has a small notch in the centre. The labellum is about long, wide and is not visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from January to May. ==Taxonomy and naming== The blushing tiny greenhood was first formally described in 2008 by David Jones who gave it the name Speculantha rubescens. The description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected in the Conimbla National Park. In 2010 Gary Backhouse changed the name to Pterostylis rubescens. The specific epithet (rubescens) is derived from the Latin word ruber meaning \\"red\\" or \\"reddish\\" with the suffix -escens meaning \\"becoming\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Pterostylis rubescens grows on slopes and ridges in open forest and woodland. It is widespread in northern Victoria and on the central and southern tablelands of New South Wales. ==References== rubescens Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 2008 ","title":"Pterostylis rubescens"},{"id":"54251922","text":"The Controller of Storekeepers Accounts also known as the Comptroller of Storekeepers Accounts was a principal member of the Navy Board who was responsible for managing and processing all naval store-keeping accounts and deliveries to naval yards from 1671 to 1796 he was based in the Navy Office he superintended the Office for Examining Storekeepers Accounts. ==History== The post was created in 1671, the Controller of Storekeeper Accounts department was responsible for examining all Naval Stores delivered to various storekeepers at all naval yards, in addition to auditing all their accounts.

They developed from the Workhouse and were run under the Poor law regime. The 1832 Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws recommended separate workhouses for the aged and infirm. Clause 45 of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 established that lunatics could not be held in a workhouse for more than a fortnight. ==1840s-1870== Workhouse residents were provided with free medical care, which was not available to those outside. Every Poor Law Union had a medical officer. Most workhouses had a small infirmary block, but nursing was in the hands of the other inmates, most of whom could not read. Where workhouses had been designed for the indigent, by the late 1840s most workhouses outside London and the larger provincial towns housed only \\"the incapable, elderly and sick\\". Standards of care were increasingly criticised: The Workhouse Visiting Society was set up in 1858 exposed the poor standards of nursing care. The 1867 report to Gathorne Hardy by Uvedale Corbett and Dr. W. O. Markham, after the scandal around the death of Timothy Daly, a resident of Holborn Workhouse Infirmary, recommended that: After the Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 more infirmaries were built in and around London. The act permitted the employment of probationary nurses who were trained for a year in the sick asylums. These nurses gradually began to replace the employment of untrained paupers who had provided what little nursing care there was. In 1869 there were about 50,000 sick paupers in workhouses. An inspector observed that the Southwark workhouse \\"does not meet the requirements of medical science, nor am I able to suggest any arrangements which would in the least enable it to do so\\". By the middle of the 19th century there was a growing realisation that the purpose of the workhouse was no longer solely or even chiefly to act as a deterrent to the able-bodied poor, and the first generation of buildings was widely considered to be inadequate. About 150 new workhouses were built mainly in London, Lancashire and Yorkshire between 1840 and 1875. These new buildings often had long corridors with separate wards leading off for men, women and children. ==1871-1900== Responsibility for administration of the Poor Law passed to the Local Government Board in 1871, and the emphasis shifted from the workhouse as \\"a receptacle for the helpless poor\\" to its role in the care of the sick and helpless. The Diseases Prevention Act of 1883 allowed workhouse infirmaries to offer treatment to non-paupers as well as inmates, and by the beginning of the 20th century some infirmaries were even able to operate as private hospitals. By the end of the century only about 20 per cent admitted to workhouses were unemployed or destitute, but about 30 per cent of the population over 70 were in workhouses. ==1900-1930== In 1901 there were 3,170 paid nurses employed in workhouses, with about 2,000 probationers - about one nurse for 20 patients. They normally worked a 70 hour week with two weeks paid holiday a year. In 1911 there were more than 100,000 sick in workhouses. The Royal Commission of 1905 reported that workhouses were unsuited to deal with the different categories of resident they had traditionally housed, and recommended that specialised institutions for each class of pauper should be established, in which they could be treated appropriately by properly trained staff. The \\"deterrent\\" workhouses were in future to be reserved for \\"incorrigibles such as drunkards, idlers and tramps\\". The Local Government Act of 1929 gave local authorities the power to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals, although outside London few did so. The workhouse system was abolished in the UK by the same Act on 1 April 1930, but many workhouses, renamed Public Assistance Institutions, continued under the control of local county councils. ==1930-48== Even in 1939 there were still almost 100,000 people accommodated in the former workhouses, 5,629 of whom were children. It was not until the 1948 National Assistance Act that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses. Many of the buildings were converted into old folks' homes run by local authorities; slightly more than 50 per cent of local authority accommodation for the elderly was provided in former workhouses in 1960. Camberwell workhouse (in Peckham, South London) continued until 1985 as a shelter for more than 1000 homeless men, operated by the Department of Health and Social Security and renamed a resettlement centre. Southwell workhouse, now a museum, was used to provide temporary accommodation for mothers and children until the early 1990s. In 1937 there were about 27,000 female nurses and 30,000 probationers working in the Poor law and municipal hospitals.

Resources can include a broad range of environmental and geographical variables, including categorical variables such as land cover type, or continuous variables such as average rainfall over a given time period. A variety of methods are used for modeling RSFs, with logistic regression being commonly used. RSFs can be fit to data where animal presence is known, but absence is not, such as for species where several individuals within a study area are fitted with a GPS collar, but some individuals may be present without collars. When this is the case, buffers of various distances are generated around known presence points, with a number of available points generated within each buffer, which represent areas where the animal could have been, but it is unknown whether they actually were. These models can be fit using binomial generalized linear models or binomial generalized linear mixed models, with the resources, or environmental and geographic data, as explanatory variables. == Scale == Resource selection functions can be modeled at a variety of spatial scales, depending on the species and the scientific question being studied. (insert one more sentence on scale) Most RSFs address one of the following scales, which were defined by Douglas Johnson in 1980 and are still used today: * First order selection: The entire range of a species * Second order selection: The home range of an individual or group of animals * Third order selection: Resource or habitat usage within an individual's or group's home range * Fourth order selection: The procurement of specific resources, such as food, at specific sites == References == Category:Ecology Category:Mathematical modeling ","title":"Resource selection function"},{"id":"54252072","text":"Nick Lloyd FRHS, is Reader in Military and Imperial History at King's College London.

Elma Linton Sandford (later Mrs Sandford-Morgan) was born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1890. Her father, Alexander Wallace Sandford, a businessman and politician, died in 1905. She was educated at a number of girls schools, before entering Cheltenham Ladies College in 1905. Her mother supported her decision to study medicine, and Sandford enrolled at the University of Sydney in 1910. She graduated with her M.D. in 1917. == Career == Sandford was appointed a resident medical officer at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Sydney, and she then became senior medical registrar at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. She travelled to England in 1919 to study ophthalmology at the London hospitals. It was there that she heard about the urgent need for doctors in India to combat eye disease. She worked for a year at the Bhiwani Mission Women's Hospital around 1920, before taking a position in Baghdad at a hospital for women and children. It was in Baghdad, that she met British Army Officer Harry Morgan, and they were married in 1921. She worked in private practice in Baghdad until their daughter, Rosemary was born in 1922. The Sandford-Morgans returned to Australia in 1923, and Dr Sandford-Morgan worked mainly in private practice, or for the Public Health Service in Hobart and Sydney. Their son, Gavin was born in 1925. Captain Morgan and Dr Sandford- Morgan separated, and she moved to Adelaide with their children around 1937. She was a director and developer of a Mothercraft training school. At a meeting of the Australian Federation of University Women in 1938, comments she made about women graduates and motherhood, made the national newspapers. == World War II == Sandford-Morgan assisted the Royal Australian Air Force Medical Service during World War II. She was appointed to a parliamentary commission investigating health services in South Australia at the close of the war. She wished to take up a position in Europe, and accepted a role as a medical officer at the Commonwealth Immigration camp in New South Wales. However, the transfer that was offered with this role to a European practice, was denied her as a woman. She resigned and sought employment on her own. == Later life == Sandford-Morgan returned to private practice in Australia, and then worked as a neoplasm registrar at the Anticancer Foundation of the University of Adelaide. She continued working until the age of 74 and thereafter volunteered at the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service until she was 80. Sandford-Morgan was President of the Medical Women's Society of South Australia. Elma Sandford-Morgan died in 1983. She was survived by her children.

Marianela Gonz√°lez and Winston Vallenilla starred as the protagonists with Jean Carlo Simancas, Roxana D√≠az and Sheyene Gerardi as the villains. ==Plot== The San Miguel Arc√°ngel Airport located in the Caribbean is the setting of this love story led by three airport stewards: Anabela Marcano, Morana Bastardo and Dulce Mar√≠a Hidalgo. These women struggle to manage their own lives and make their own way in a world dominated by men. Anabela dreams of being a professional pilot like her late father, who died in a mysterious plane crash. While planning how to achieve his dream, pretends to settle for employment in the airline Alas del Caribe. In her desire for freedom, Anabela decides to flee her home with Humberto, a mediocre pilot who seduces her with the false promise of helping her in her Aeronautical studies. In Anabela's plans, Rub√©n Alegr√≠a, who possesses the same dream as herself, has the unconditional support of his humble parents, Divina and Bienvenido, and sisters, Celia and Cruz. Everyone encourages Rub√©n to fulfill his dreams even though no one understands Rub√©n's lack of enthusiasm for popular music and much less share his strange obsession with flying, as everyone in the family suffer from vertigo. Morana is the veteran head of the Alas del Caribe stewardesses. Ignacio has an ambition of power and is also lover of Ignacio Urquiaga, owner of the Lince airline, direct competition of the first. However, everyone is unaware that Morana is half-sister to Humberto, Anabela's boyfriend, and that she is the only person for whom Morana feels a sincere and disinterested love. In his many attempts to rid himself of his rival, Morana will use Enrique √Ålvarez, a competent, respected instructor pilot, who is blindly in love with her. Dulce Mar√≠a, the third protagonist, also chooses to take a little traveled road by becoming an aircraft mechanic for the airline \\"Lince\\". Contrary to what her name indicates, she is a sullen, homeless-looking girl, very ungrateful, who has secretly fallen in love with Alcides Urquiaga, the son of her boss, a heartthrob heartthrob. Alcides devotes every spare hour to his true passion, music, behind his severe father, Ignacio Urquiaga; He demands that his son fulfill the family tradition of becoming a pilot, like all men in the family, without realizing that his son has a very severe vertigo that prevents him from boarding an aircraft. In the turbulent world of aviation, where competition and professional strife, adventure and unbridled romance reign, the three women will each drive their fate to their particular sky, using their own weapons to reach it. ==Cast== *Marianela Gonz√°lez as Anabela Marcano *Winston Vallenilla as Rub√©n Alegr√≠a *Roxana D√≠az as Morana Bastardo *Jer√≥nimo Gil as Alcides Uriquiaga *√Åmbar D√≠az as Dulce Mar√≠a Hidalgo *Sheyene Gerardi as Sonia *Jean Carlo Simancas as Ignacio Uriquiaga *Marialejandra Mart√≠n as Divina Alegr√≠a *Daniel Alvarado as Bienvenido Alegr√≠a *Ricardo Bianchi as Tom√°s Torres \\"Tot√≥\\" *Aileen Celeste as Victoria Berm√∫dez de Torres *Sandro Finoglio as Enrique √Ålvarez *Luis Gerardo N√∫√±ez as Arturo Alc√°ntara *Marlene Maseda as Luc√≠a de Alc√°ntara *Margarita Hern√°ndez as Violeta de Uriquiaga *Cayito Aponte as Viejo \\"El Carrizo\\" *Gioia Lombardini as Luc√≠a Carrizo de Cantaclaro *Estefan√≠a L√≥pez as Cruz Alegr√≠a *C√©sar Rom√°n as Zarataco *Daniela Navarro as Chacha Mart√≠nez *Sandra Mart√≠nez as Reina Patricia Hidalgo *Carmen Alicia Lara as Celia Alegr√≠a *Juan Carlos Mart√≠nez as Zuz√∫ *Eric Noriega as Tirso *Aleska D√≠az-Granados as Ifigenia *Enrique Izquierdo as Lucho *Liliana Mel√©ndez as Finita *Natalia Romero as Nereida *Andre√≠na Mazzeo as Martita *Ileana Alom√° as Gladys *Luis Olavarrieta as Torcuato P√©rez *Jos√© Madon√≠a as R√≥mulo *Eduardo Orozco as Humberto Bastardo ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:RCTV telenovelas Category:2006 telenovelas Category:Venezuelan telenovelas Category:2006 Venezuelan television series debuts Category:2006 Venezuelan television series endings Category:Spanish-language telenovelas Category:Television shows set in Caracas ","title":"Por todo lo alto"},{"id":"54252382","text":"Jonathan G.

He is a member of 17th Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh representing the Morabad constituency on a Samajwadi Party ticket. He is also the district president of the party. == Political career == In 2012, Qureshi was made the chairman of the \\"Essential commodities corporation\\". After being elevated to the post, he celebrated by leading a procession. There it was found, that his supporters were throwing money in air. However, the Bulandshahr police said that they were unaware of such procession. In January 2017, he was made the Moradabad district president of Samajwadi Party, succeeding Athar Ali Ansari. Though Qureshi's name did not feature in the list of candidates for the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election by Mulayam Singh Yadav, his son Akhilesh Yadav included him in his list. He was made a candidate for Moradabad Rural (succeeding sitting MLA Shameemul Haq) as he fitted Samajwadi Party's strategy of caste equation. He was also made a candidate for supporting Akhilesh Yadav in his family feud. In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, Qureshi emerged victorious by defeating his nearest rival, a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate by around 28 thousand votes. Qureshi was polled 98 thousand votes compared to BSP's candidate Pannalal who won 69 thousand votes. == Controversy == In April 2017, a Muslim girl, Shazia alleged that Qureshi's men had assaulted her and her family.

The Thor experiment aims to investigate electrical activity from thunderstorms and convection related to water vapour transport. The experiment is named as 'Thor' after the god of thunder, lightning and storms in Nordic mythology. The experiment is conducted by European Space Agency with a thundercloud imaging system 400 km above Earth. ==Details== The project analyses electrical activity of thunderstorms by using optical cameras on the International Space Station, ground observations of lightning, and meteorological satellite observations of cloud properties. It is very difficult to capture some of the most violent electric discharges from the ground because the atmosphere blocks radiation. From International Space Station, it will be able to aim the camera, to zoom in and follow interesting regions as the Space Station passes by. The project was initiated by the Danish ESA-astronaut, Andreas Mogensen, and has already delivered valuable data for climate research. More specifically, it studies about the transport of water from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and circulation of the stratosphere and mesosphere driven by internal gravity waves. Convective processes of the troposphere affect the transport of water vapour-a green house gas, and its circulation in both the stratosphere and mesosphere. By analysing the processes that occur in these layers, can improve atmospheric models, and provide a better understanding of Earth's climate and weather. The experiment also studies how much water the cloud turrets can carry into the stratosphere, and how lightning influences their formation. Thor analyses red sprites, blue and gigantic jets from the Space Station over Earth at night. Sprites appear as luminous reddish-orange flashes and last 20 milliseconds at most. They often occur in clusters within atmosphere above the troposphere at an altitude range of 50‚Äì90 km (31‚Äì56 mi). They were first photographed on July 6, 1989 by scientists from the University of Minnesota and have subsequently been captured in video recordings many thousands of times. Even though these were discovered only 20 years ago, they hold the key to comprehend the Earth's electrical circuitry that give rise to the storms and currents that churn up the atmosphere. Blue jets can move at speeds of up to 360,000 km/h (220,000 mph) and without a high speed camera they can be easily missed by the human eye. 200px Data from this experiment could improve the understanding how lightning activity powers cloud turrets, gravity waves, the structure of Transient Luminous Events above thunderstorms. According to Torsten Neubert, of Technical University of Denmark (DTU), the role of thunderstorms in our climate is significant, and Thor will help improve the predictions about the future climate and its consequences. ESA observes that the blue discharges and jets are examples of a little-understood part of our atmosphere and the associated events have implications for how our atmosphere protects us from radiation.\\". The images and detailed observations of the flashes were released to the public on January 9 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The Thor experience will team up with the Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM) experiment on a platform outside the Columbus module in 2017. The ASIM experiment will attempt to observe two ultraviolet optical bands, as well as the X- and gamma-rays, a first for the Space Station. ==See also== * Aurora (astronomy) * Sprite (lightning) * Catatumbo lightning * Cosmic ray visual phenomena * List of European Space Agency programs and missions ==References== Attribution * Category:European Space Agency Category:International Space Station experiments Category:Microscale meteorology ","title":"Thor experiment"},{"id":"54252485","text":"Raymond Volkas is a theoretical particle physicist from the University of Melbourne.

The first half of the trail takes an inland route, with the second half (from Abergwyngregyn onwards) following the north coast of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula. It measures 133.9 miles (215 km) in length, and was officially launched at Porth y Swnt, Aberdaron on 10 July 2014. Development of the trail started in 2011, and its official opening followed a number of alterations to the original route to suit local concerns. The route, which is marked by waymarker disks, makes use of existing public rights of way, including sections of the Wales Coast Path, and along the way it visits many small stone churches, many dedicated to key Celtic Saints, which can provide shelter and rest along the trail. Whilst, historically, pilgrims would have made their way across North Wales to Bardsey Island, known as the legendary 'Island of 20,000 Saints', the trail is a modern interpretation, and does not necessarily follow old routes. The Trail is a part of the 'Our Heritage' project, a part of Cadw‚Äôs Heritage Tourism Project; this is partially funded by the European Regional Development Fund via the Welsh Government. Dr. Rowan Williams, a Welsh Anglican bishop, theologian and poet, and former Archbishop of Canterbury, is Patron of the route. An annual pilgrimage is organised along the full length of the route for a fortnight every May/June, and in 2018 the North Wales Pilgrims Way Ultra - a 3-day race - will see runners competing for the North Wales Pilgrims Way Brass Shield. == Historical basis == Since the 7th Century pilgrims in North Wales have visited four main sites ‚Äì Holywell, Gwytherin, Clynnog Fawr and Bardsey Island. The first three have associations with two Welsh Saints, namely Saint Winifred and Saint Beuno; the North Wales Pilgrims Way links many of the locations associated with them. Saint Winifred (or Winefride) () was a 7th-century Welsh Christian woman, around whom many historical legends have formed. A healing spring at the traditional site of her decapitation and restoration is now a shrine and pilgrimage site called St Winefride's Well in Holywell, and known as the Lourdes of Wales. Saint Beuno (sometimes anglicized as 'Bono') was a 7th-century Welsh abbot, confessor, and saint. Bardsey Island has been an important religious site since Saint Cadfan built a monastery there in 516, and in medieval times it was a major centre of pilgrimage. == The route == The trail runs from east to west, starting at Basingwerk Abbey (), a Grade I listed ruined abbey near Holywell, Flintshire, and ends at Aberdaron on the western tip of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula () in Gwynedd. From here, a final part of the route, regarded as optional, is the boat trip (weather permitting) from Aberdaron to Bardsey Island; the boat sails from Porth Meudwy, which is 1.2 miles (1.8 km) from Aberdaron by the Coastal Path footpath. Basingwerk Abbey, the start of the Trail Aberdaron, the end of the Trail. Y Gegin Fawr (the white building), built in the 13th century for pilgrims, now serves as a tearoom. The remains of St Mary's Abbey on Bardsey Island For marketing purposes the Trail is divided into 25 short sections: * 1 - Basingwerk Abbey to Pantasaph (3 miles / 4.6 km) * 2 - Pantasaph to Maen Achwyfan (Whitford) (3.3 miles / 5.3 km) * 3 - Maen Achwgfan to Llanasa (2.7 miles / 4.3 km) * 4 - Llanasa to Trelawnyd (2.4 miles / 3.8 km) * 5 - Trelawnyd to Tremeirchion (6 miles / 9.6 km) * 6 - Tremeirchion to St Asaph (3.5 miles /5.6 km) * 7 - St Asaph to Llannefydd (6.3 miles /10.1 km) * 8 - Llannefydd to Llansannan (4.5 miles / 7.2 km) * 9 - Llansannan to Gwytherin (7.0 miles / 11.3 km) * 10 - Gwytherin to Pandy Tudur (3.4 miles / 5.5 km) * 11 - Pandy Tudur to Llangernyw (2.5 miles / 4 km) * 12 - Llangernyw to Eglwysbach (7.5 miles / 12 km) * 13 - Eglwysbach to Rowen (3.5 miles / 6 km) * 14 - Rowen to Penmaenmawr Stone Circles (4.4 miles / 7.0 km) * 15 - Penmaenmawr Stone Circles to Abergwyngregyn (6.6 miles / 10.6 km) * 16 - Abergwyngregyn to Bangor (12.33m / 19.84 km) * 17 - Bangor to Llanberis (10.6m / 17.1 km) * 18 - Llanberis to Waunfawr (4.5 miles / 7.3 km) * 19 - Waunfawr to Penygroes (7.1 miles / 11.5 km) * 20 - Penygroes to Clynnog Fawr (6.3 miles / 10.5 km) * 21 - Clynnog Fawr to Trefor (4 miles / 6 km) * 22 - Trefor to Nefyn (6.3 miles / 9.6 km) * 23 - Nefyn to Towyn (Tudweiliog) (6.8 miles / 11 km) * 24 - Towyn (Tudweiliog) to Porth Oer (Whistling Sands) (8 miles / 13 km) * 25 - Porth Oer to Aberdaron (3.3 miles / 5.4 km) * (26 - Boat trip to Bardsey Island) == Pilgrim passport stamps == A 'Pilgrim Passport' (a souvenir leaflet) can be obtained from the Greenfield Valley Heritage Park Visitor Centre at the start of the route at Basingwerk Abbey, or from other churches visited along the route. A total of 23 churches and other locations passed have available a passport stamp, enabling the walker to 'stamp their passport' as they visit the sites along the way. Each stamp is different, and has been designed by primary school children from schools along the route to reflect the ancient landmarks, sites and legends encountered on the trail. Artist Ruth Thomas worked with Flintshire and Denbighshire schoolchildren to achieve this, whilst artist Eleri Jones worked with schools in Conwy and Gwynedd. == Sacred Doorways Trail == Marketed alongside the Pilgrims Way in the counties of Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire is the 'Sacred Doorways' project () which features churches and chapels of interest. The churches involved in the project are: Conwy cluster - * St Michael's, Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr; * St Mary Magdalene's, Cerrigydrudion; * St John's, Ysbyty Ifan; * St Tudclud's, Penmachno; * St Gwyddelan's, Dolwyddelan; * St Michael's, Betws-y-coed; * St Mary's, Betws-y-coed; * St Julitta's, Capel Curig; * St Rhychwyn's, Llanrhychwyn; * St Mary's, Trefriw; * St Peter's, Llanbedr-y-Cennin; * St Mary's, Caerhun; * St Celynnin's, Llangelynnin; * Zion Chapel, Rowen; * St Grwst's, Llanrwst; * Seion Chapel, Llanrwst; * St Doged's, Llanddoged; * St Martin's, Eglwysbach; * St Digain's, Llangernyw; * St Mary's, Llanfair Talhaiarn; * St Sannan's, Llansannan Denbighshire cluster - * Ss Mael & Sulien, Corwen; * St Trillo's, Llandrillo; * St Elidan's, Llanelidan; * St Bridget's, Carrog; * St Tysilio's, Bryneglwys; * Corpus Christi, Tremeirchion The Sacred Doorways sign outside St Michael's church, Betws-y-coed Flintshire cluster - * Ss Beuno & Mary, Whitford; * St Michael's, Caerwys; * Ss Asaph & Cyndeyrn, Llanasa; * St Mary Magdalene's, Gwaenysgor (Trelawnyd); * St James, Holywell; * Ss Mael & Sulien, Cwm The front cover of the Sacred Doorways Pilgrims Passport In the Conwy Valley a Sacred Doorways Trail - a tourism initiative funded through Conwy's Rural Development plan - links together some of the most interesting churches and chapels in that area. These churches also have a Pilgrims Way passport stamp - and there is space on the passport for them - although they are not strictly on the Pilgrims Way Trail. The Pilgrims Passport claims: The four trails in Conwy are packaged into clusters, and can be undertaken on foot, using public footpaths, or in a car. The trails comprise: Rural Conwy Sacred Trails Leaflet * Sacred Hiraethog (visiting St Michael's Church at Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, St Mary Magdalene's Church at Cerrigydrudion, the Parish Church at Pentrefoelas, St John's Church at Ysbyty Ifan, and St Tudclud's Church at Penmachno) - a total of 17 miles / 27 km * Sacred Snowdonia (visiting St Gwyddelan's Church at Dolwyddelan, St Mary's and St Michael's Churches at Betws-y-coed, and St Julitta's Church at Capel Curig) - a total of 16 miles / 25 km * Sacred Kingdom (visiting St Grwst's Church and Gwydir Chapel at Llanrwst, St Doged's Church at Llanddoged, Gwydir Uchaf near Llanrwst, St Rhychwyn's Church at Llanrhychwyn, and St Mary's Church at Trefriw) - a total of 9 miles / 14 km * Sacred Landscapes (visiting St Peter's Church at Llanbedr-y-cennin, St Mary's Church at Caerhun, Zion Chapel at Rowen, and St Celynnin's Church at Llangelynnin) - a total of 7.5 miles / 12 km The 4 trails can be linked together by walking an additional 10 miles / 16 km. (Note - there is a similarly named 'Sacred Door Trail' - a 200-mile interfaith pilgrimage trail - in south-western Montana). == Maps and guides == Route maps of the Pilgrims Way can be downloaded from the main website, and the committee has approved a guide book \\\\- The Pilgrims Way / Taith Pererin Gogledd Cymru by Mike Stevens, published by local publishers Kittiwake Books. Chris Potter has produced an up to date quide book on behalf of the North Wales Pilgrims Way Committee. It is titled North Wales Pilgrims Way - The Official Guide to the Welsh Camino. It is available through the website https://pilgrims-way-north-wales.org/ Route maps of the Sacred Doorways trails are available on a downloadable leaflet. == Access == Some churches and chapels on the trail rely on the generosity of volunteers to open and close them daily. Furthermore, churches may not be open during the winter months. If the building is not open, details of where to obtain the key will be available near the church or chapel entrance. == See also == * Ll≈∑n Coastal Path * Wales Coast Path * The Pilgrims Way (in Southern England) * Long-distance footpaths in Wales * Long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom == References External links== * Pilgrims Way North Wales website * History Points - North Wales Pilgrims Way * Rural Conwy Sacred Trails Leaflet (pdf)] * Our Heritage (Visit Wales) website * Long Distance Walkers Association - The North Wales Pilgrims Trail * The Daily Post - The Pilgrims Way from Holywell to Bardsey Island Category:Long-distance footpaths in Wales Category:Coastal paths in Wales Category:Tourist attractions in Wales ","title":"North Wales Pilgrims Way"},{"id":"54252498","text":"Amraha is a village located in the Gaya town C.D. block of Gaya district of the Indian state of Bihar. == Demographics == This village hosts a population of 513 families, and an overall population of 3303 according to government records. ==Administration== Amraha village is administrated by Mukhiya through its Gram Panchayat. ==References== Category:Villages in Gaya district ","title":"Amraha"},{"id":"54252501","text":"The canton of Chatou is an administrative division of the Yvelines department, northern France.

Playing his character Max, a world-weary but wily old gangster, it was the last film made by Gabin. ==Plot== In a Paris prison, the respected old gangster Max tells a young crook Pierre about stolen gold he once buried under a lemon tree beside a little old church on the outskirts of Rome. Pierre suggests that with millions of pilgrims flocking to Rome for Holy Year they could get there unnoticed. So Max contacts Marcel, an old associate, to arrange clothes, passports and plane tickets. When all is ready, the two break out and in a couple of hours are airborne, with Max dressed as a Belgian bishop and Pierre as his chaplain. Also on the plane with her husband is Christina, a former lover of Max, who recognises him straight away but will not betray him. Other passengers include a group of incompetent young Italian hijackers, who divert it at gunpoint to Tangier, demanding a getaway car and a million dollars. When cash and car are ready, Max volunteers to be the hijackers' hostage and within minutes relieves them of their guns and money. The flight resumes to Rome, where it is met by Barbier of the Paris police, who has worked out who the Belgian bishop is. After tense negotiations, Barbier agrees to reclaim the million dollars and, because they saved the lives of hundreds of passengers, to let Max and Pierre go free. The two take a cab to the church, which looks different and has no lemon tree. Inside, the parish priest tells them that lightning destroyed the old church and the tree, but among its roots they found a miraculous cache of gold, which enabled them to build this magnificent new church.

Limestone is quarried here which in the 1950s was in demand by the steel industry for lining the furnaces. In the late 19th century there were only two houses, later just one farm. The population in 1880 was 11 persons, increasing to 20 in 1914 and decreasing to six in 1950. The area of Wath covered about and included the northeastern part of Wath Wood. Until 1866 the place was considered a township, then a civil parish, and later became part of the Hovingham parish. The farm on the northern side of the road is now used as business premises by a fabric store.

Mary Basset ( ‚Äì 20 March 1572; n√©e Roper; also Clarke) was a translator of works into the English language. Basset is cited as the only woman during the reign of Mary Tudor to have her work appear in print. As the daughter of Margaret Roper and William Roper and the granddaughter of Sir Thomas More, she had an outstanding education; her tutors included John Christopherson. She married first Stephen Clarke, but no children came of this union; after his death, she married James Basset, by June 1556. Between 1544 and 1553, Mary produced the first English translation of the Ecclesiastical History by Eusebius, now surviving in a single manuscript in the British Library, Harley MS 1860, along with her translation of its first book into Latin. Her work is based on the edition published by Robert Estienne in 1544; her learnedness is reflected in her comments on the text's inaccuracies. In 1560 Mary also translated More's De tristitia Christi into English. Nicholas Harpsfield wrote that she had also translated the History of Socrates, Theodoretus, Sozomenus, and Evagrius, but no copies of these are known. Her translations are characterized by the same engagement in contemporary political and ideological debates as can be seen in More and Margaret Roper.

She also was billed as Freya Leigh. == Early years == Leyton was born in California (or Somers, Wisconsin) but lived with her family in Mexico, where her father was a mining engineer. She was educated at the Bennett School for Girls in Millbrook, New York; a school in Lausanne, Switzerland; and at the Sorbonne. == Acting == She became an actress after a failed marriage and acted in Green Grow the Lilacs on Broadway and several Charlie Chan films. Her Broadway credits also included Red Harvest (1937), A Hero Is Born (1937), and We Are No Longer Children (1932), for which she was billed as Freya Leigh. In 1937, Leyton acted in a Works Progress Administration Theatre Project in New York. She went from there to England, where she performed in Golden Boy. == French resistance == In 1937 Leyton moved to Paris with her future husband Jacques Terrane (born Jacques Tarti√®re), a Franco-American actor who died in Syria in 1941 fighting with the Free French forces. In France, Leyton produced and interviewed people on programs for Radio Mondial, a shortwave radio station operated by France's Ministry of Information. The programs were designed to promote France to an American audience. Leyton broadcast for the Voice of America while acting in Paris in 1938 and her criticisms of the Nazi regime during these broadcasts earned her a promise of execution announced by Berlin radio. In September 1942, she was arrested by the Nazis after northern and western France came under German occupation ‚Äî but only because she was an American woman, her true identity unknown to the authorities. She managed to escape from her prison camp with the help of French doctors by feigning cancer. She returned to her home in Barbizon in 1942 and joined the resistance movement, helping 42 downed Allied airmen escape to freedom and hiding others in her home until the war ended. During this period, she was known as Dorothy Tarti√®re, using her married name. She was assisted at times in hiding the airmen by Sylvia Beach, American-born owner of the Paris bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Leyton and M. H. Werner wrote about this period in a book The House Near Paris. == Personal life == Leyton met Tarti√®re in New York in 1937, and they wed in 1938 in London. == Death == On 2 February 1997, Leyton died in Corona del Mar, California. == Filmography == {  - !

Carney and Isaac Getz, refers to an organization which, according to the authors, unleashes employees' initiative and responsibility by treating them as adults. == Presentation == The notion of liberated or ‚Äúfreedom-form‚Äù (F-Form) company was further formalized by Isaac Getz in his 2009 academic article \\"Liberating Leadership: How the initiative-freeing radical organizational has been successfully adopted\\" in California Management Review, in which he describes it \\"as an organizational form that allows employees complete freedom and responsibility to take actions they decide are best\\". He specifies that, like architects who define human-built structures (for example a bridge) based on functions (allowing passage over an obstacle) rather than structural features, the freedom-form company is similarly defined by its function (to enable freedom and responsibility of initiative) rather than a model. According to the author, to facilitate employee freedom and responsibility, corporate liberation requires transformation‚Äîguided by the company's leader‚Äîof organizational practices that prevent them. For example, corporate liberation involves a drastic reduction of internal controls, rules, and regulations. Liberating leadership is an essential part of building liberated companies. Liberated companies are based on a business philosophy, not a model, of freedom and responsibility concepts. This is intrinsically linked to liberating leadership, a type of transformational leadership, needed to articulate this philosophy within the human context of each company to build its unique organizational form. In this sense, valuable and useful practices for one liberated company would not necessarily be suitable for another. Similar to the diversity in the organizational forms adopted by these companies, there is no standard path or method to build them. Each liberating leader co-designs, together with the employees, their unique liberation path. Further on, the liberating leader maintains and evolves this organizational form that they helped build. == Influences and origins == The influences most cited by liberating leaders who have built freedom and responsibility-based organizational forms are: * Theorists: Douglas McGregor, Stephen Covey, Abraham Maslow, Peter Senge, Jean-Christian Fauvet and Shoji Shiba; * Author- leaders: Robert Townsend; Max De Pree and Ricardo Semler Deployed since 1958 in many countries, it has as pioneers companies such as W.L. Gore & Associates, Avis (in the 1960s), USAA, Sun Hydraulics, Quad Graphics, Richards Group, IDEO, Chaparral Steel, Harley Davidson, and Vertex Inc. in the United States, FAVI, SEW Usocome, and Bretagne Atelier in France, SOL in Finland and Radica Games in China. These pioneers have been extremely successful both in human and economic terms for several decades and with several succeeding CEOs. Despite that, until the 2010s, the phenomenon of freedom- and responsibility- based companies remained marginal. == Contemporary practice == Since the beginning of the 2010s, a growing number of companies of all sizes and sectors, such as Decathlon, Michelin, Airbus, Kiabi, and Poult have entered corporate liberation. Organizations in the non-profit sector, such as two Belgian ministries, the Social Security and a few municipalities in France, have also joined this movement. According to the Belgian business daily L‚ÄôEcho, 8% of companies have entered corporate liberation. The world region with the highest absolute number of liberated companies is France and Belgium where the phenomenon is called entreprise lib√©r√©e. Their number is estimated in hundreds and they have been abundantly covered in press, TV and radio, and even in a comic book. == Comparable philosophies == A number of leaders have developed organizational philosophies highly compatible with liberated companies: Herb Kelleher in SouthWest Airlines, Ricardo Semler in Semco in Brazil, Vineet Nayar in HCL Technologies in India, David Marquet on a US nuclear submarine, Michel Herv√© in Groupe Herv√© in France, Henry Stewart in Happy Ltd. In United Kingdom, Jos de Blok in Buurtzorg Nederland, Gabe Newell in Valve, Matt Perez in Nearsoft. == Misconceptions == * The \\"model\\" misconception: Liberated company, a business philosophy based on the freedom and responsibility concepts, is often presumed to be a management model. However, liberated companies have no structural elements (model) which hold across all its past, present, or future implementations. * The \\"cost-cutting\\" misconception: Liberated companies are sometimes portrayed as a cost-cutting approach because it relies on self-directing teams and needs less managerial and control functions. Though at the beginning of the liberation the costs may go up, liberated companies do not suffer from the hidden costs of traditional companies. Lower costs‚Äîand higher profits‚Äîare not the goals but are by- products of corporate liberation (see John Kay's notion of obliquity). * The \\"self-exploitation\\" misconception: The liberated company is sometimes portrayed as a high-pressure work environment in which employees work more, not less. It is true that based on intrinsic motivation, the liberated work- environment is characterized by high worker engagement. Some leaders in liberated companies enforce a limit on maximum working hours, but not all. * The ‚ÄúHolacracy‚Äù misconception: Because liberated companies and Holacracy both criticize the traditional command-and-control model, Holacracy has been sometimes presented as a ‚Äútechnology‚Äù inside of liberated companies. As a consequence, some critiques of Holacracy have been directed by association at liberated companies. Unlike Holacracy, corporate liberation does not rely on any method or model; instead, each time an idiosyncratic path is used to co- invent a unique organizational form.Muriel Jasor, , 12 Sept 2016 * The \\"Liberation Management\\" misconception: Because Tom Peters wrote a book with the title ‚ÄúLiberation Management‚Äù, which is semantically close to the term ‚Äúliberated company‚Äù, it is sometimes thought that he coined ‚Äúliberated company‚Äù. In reality, Peters never used the term ‚Äúliberated company‚Äù in this book, nor the terms ‚Äúliberty‚Äù or ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù which are central to the definition of ‚Äúliberated company\\". Peters has agreed with the interviewer's claim \\"when I read Liberation Management, the two things that come out big in that book are the use of networks and the use of knowledge management\\". == Criticisms == Some companies, such as Avis, Harley Davidson, and Radica Games, sought to be liberated and later reverted to traditional command-and-control organizational forms. Since liberated organizational forms are maintained by company heads, if they are replaced by new ones who aren‚Äôt liberating leaders, the liberated form can quickly dissolve, despite declining performance. Change of ownership can also put a limit to corporate liberation by imposing strategies incompatible with liberated companies‚Äô typical values such as trust, fairness, and respect. == See also == * Benefit corporation * Holacracy * Sociocracy == References  Bibliography == * *Carney, Brian M. and Getz, Isaac (2016) \\"Freedom Inc.

At the time of European settlement in 1869 at Palmerston, now Darwin, many of the country's other mineral resources had already been exploited. Therefore, new mining opportunities accelerated development in the north. Alluvial tin was found in the area by Tim O'Shea in 1910, a stockman from Pine Creek, but he never registered a claim. In September 1913, Maranboy was declared as a goldfield for a period of two years. Tin was discovered at Maranboy in 1913 by prospectors Scharber and Richardson. Tin mines and a battery were operational in the same year. By 1918 the price of tin was booming. The battery closed in 1949 for repairs but never reopened. ==Workers== Prospectors of European, Chinese and Aboriginal descent worked at Maranboy.

He has been arrested, charged, and convicted for some of his activities. Others have been brought to light through his publication on social media, such as Instagram and YouTube. ==One World Trade Center== In March 2014, Casquejo climbed to the top of the topped- out, but not yet completed, One World Trade Center. Casquejo, then 16 years old, entered the site through a hole in a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, snuck in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower's 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site. In July 2014, in a plea agreement, Casquejo admitted to breaking a city misdemeanor law against scaling tall buildings without permission. He was sentenced to 23 days of service (which he completed with an extra six days). He submitted, as was required, a 1,200-word essay explaining what he had learned from the episode. ==Weehawken Water Tower== In September 2014, Casquejo was again arrested for scaling the Weehawken Water Tower. He was charged with defiant trespassing and resisting arrest. ==70 Pine Street== On February 21, 2016, Casquejo was charged with misdemeanor BASE jumping and trespassing for climbing above the roof at 70 Pine Street, an , 67-story luxury apartment in the Financial District. He avoided jail time in the sentencing on September 6, 2017 after pleading guilty to BASE jumping. He was granted youthful offender status; the case will eventually be sealed. ==Paramount Tower== In June 2017, Casquejo was arrested at the https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115529/paramount-tower-apartments-new-york- city-ny-usa Paramount, a 52-story residential skyscraper on East 39th Street in Turtle Bay, Manhattan.

After working at St John's as engineering professor for two years, Fan pursued a Bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1922. There, he studied under Paul Philippe Cret, who had been trained in the Beaux- Arts style. Fan travelled extensively in Europe and America, acquiring a taste for modern, Western architectural styles, such as Art Deco. Upon his return to Shanghai in 1922, Fan joined the Sino-American engineering venture Lam, Glines & Company (ÂÖÅÂÖÉÂÖ¨Âè∏) of Von-Fong Lam (1891‚Äì1987). Three years later he opened one of the first Chinese architectural practices in Shanghai with fellow University of Pennsylvania alumnus Zhao Chen. Fan and Zhao designed the Nanking Theater in 1930 (now called the Shanghai Concert Hall), near People‚Äôs Square, before parting ways to start separate firms. The following year, Fan also designed the Chinese YMCA (now the Marvel Hotel Shanghai), combining typical elements of Chinese architecture with Modern lines. He is also responsible for the Art Deco Majestic Theatre on Jiangning Lu in Jingan, built in 1941. Beyond his own firm, Fan worked with the government on several occasions. He served as a member of the Committee of the Nanjing City Planning Bureau in 1929, and was a technical consultant for the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing in 1932; where he was responsible for both the Railway and Health Ministries. Eventually, Fan abandoned his Beaux-Arts training to embrace Modernist thinking. In 1933, he completed the Yafa Court apartment complex (253 ‚Äì 267 Wuyuan Road). These apartments were advertised as having ‚Äúmodern sanitation, central heating, hot and cold water, Westinghouse refrigerators, and garages‚Äù. Fan also designed, in 1942, the Georgia Apartments on Hengshan Road in a late Art Deco style. His also worked in Hong Kong on several buildings of the Chinese University's Chung Chi College (1956), Shek Kip Mei Police Station (1960), North Point Methodist Church (1961), Silver Capitol Cinema in Kwun Tong (1964), Hoover Theatre in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Spinners Factory in Cheung Sha Wan and the Vitasoy Bottling Plant in Kwun Tong. After the Communists took control of China in 1949, Fan fled with his wife to Hong Kong, at the age of 56.

In 2014, it ranked second (after Mauritius) on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, which assesses 52 countries. On the Human Development Index, it is ranked 123rd. Life expectancy was 75 years in 2013, on a par with the other two African leaders for this indicator, Mauritius and Seychelles.  Economic performance  The economy of Cape Verde is oriented towards services (75% of GDP in 2012), with agriculture contributing a further 8% and industry 17% of GDP. In 2012, the country's main export products were mackerel (16.5%), skipjack or stripebellied bonito (15.4%) and yellowfin tunas (14.2%). GDP per capita rose from $5,338 to $6,416 (in purchasing power parity) between 2007 and 2013. Between 2002 and 2008, Cape Verde experienced strong annual growth of over 4% which even peaked at 15% in 2007, according to the World Bank. After a brief recession in 2009, the economy bounced back to 4% growth in 2011, 0.8% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2015. Thanks to its sustained economic performance, this isolated and fragmented territory with a dry Sahelian climate and scarce natural resources acceded to the World Bank‚Äôs middle-income category in 2011. Only four other West African countries have obtained the same status: C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. In order to maintain the momentum, the government has devised its third Growth and Poverty Strategy Paper covering the period 2012‚Äì2016. Expanding the coverage of health service delivery and human capital development have been designated priority areas, in order to ensure inclusive growth, with an emphasis on technical and vocational training.  Education  In 2013, Cape Verde invested 5% of GDP in education. Although this is down from 7.5% in 2004, it remains high. This strategy has paid off. Cape Verde's literacy rate is now the highest in West Africa: 98% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were literate in 2012. The same year, 93% of children attended secondary school in Cape Verde (up from 85% in 2009), compared to an average of 46% for West Africa as a whole. Cape Verde devoted 0.79% of GDP to higher education in 2013, a fairly consistent rate in recent years. Cape Verde raised its tertiary enrolment rate from 15% in 2009 to 21% in 2012. The average gross enrolment rate for tertiary education in West Africa was 9.2% in 2012 The same year, there were 10 PhD students, 11,210 were studying for a bachelor's or master's degree and 580 were enrolled in non-degree post-secondary education. In total, there were 11,800 tertiary students, compared to 4,567 in 2006. In 2011, 59% of tertiary students were women.  A 'cyber island'  Cape Verde Telecom linked all the islands by fibre optic cable in 2000. In December 2010, it joined the West African Cable System project to provide residents with an alternative access route to high-speed internet. Thanks to this, internet penetration more than doubled between 2008 and 2013 to 37.5% of the population. As the cost remains high, the government provides centres where people can surf the internet free of charge. In 2015, the government was planning to build a ‚Äòcyber-island‚Äô which would develop and offer services that include software development, computer maintenance and back office operations. Approved in 2013, the Praia Technology Park is a step in this direction. Financed by the African Development Bank, it is expected to be operational by 2018. The government launched the Mundu Novu project in 2009 to modernize education. The project is introducing the concept of interactive education into teaching and mainstreaming informatics into curricula at different levels. Some 150 000 computers are being distributed to public schools. By early 2015, the Mundu Novu education plan had equipped 18 schools and training centres with internet access, installed the Wimax antenna network across the country, produced teaching kits on ICTs for 433 classrooms in 29 pilot schools (94% of all classrooms), given university students access to digital libraries and introduced courses in information technology, in addition to implementing an Integrated Management and Monitoring System for university students. == Research trends ==  Financial investment  So far, the research sector has had little impact in West Africa, owing to a lack of national research and innovation strategies, low investment in research and development, little private-sector involvement and little intraregional collaboration among West African researchers. The government remains by far the biggest source of research funding in all countries. In 2011, Cape Verde devoted just 0.07% of GDP to research and development, among the lowest rates in West Africa. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Culture plans to strengthen the research and academic sectors by placing emphasis on greater mobility, through exchange programmes and international co-operation agreements. As part of this strategy, Cape Verde is participating in the Ibero-American academic mobility programme that expects to mobilize 200 000 academics between 2015 and 2020.  Researchers  Cape Verde counted 25 researchers in 2011, a researcher density of 51 per million inhabitants. The world average was 1,083 per million in 2013. All 25 researchers were working in the government sector in 2011. There was no research being conducted in either medical or agricultural sciences. One in three researchers were women (36%) in 2011. Of the eight engineers involved in research and development, one was a woman. Three of the five researchers working in natural sciences were women, as were three of the six social scientists and two of the five researchers from the humanities.

In 2014, Cape Verde had the second-highest publication intensity (65 articles per million inhabitants) in West Africa after Gambia (65 articles per million inhabitants), another country with a small population. The average for sub-Saharan Africa in 2014 was 20 articles per million inhabitants in the Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Scientists from Cape Verde published most in geosciences between 2008 and 2014: 33 out of 78 articles (42% of output). Over this seven-year period, there were just 3 articles from this country focusing on agricultural sciences and seven on medical sciences. This is no doubt related to the fact that there were no researchers specializing in these two fields in 2011. In the great majority of ECOWAS countries, more than eight out of ten scientific articles catalogued in the Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) between 2008 and 2014 had foreign partners. In the case of Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and Liberia, this was even the case for the totality of articles, a situation which also correlates with a low output. The main collaborators of researchers from Cape Verde between 2008 and 2014 were Portuguese (42 articles), Spanish (23), British (15 ), American (11) and German (8) scientists. == Regional science and technology policy == Cape Verde is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In 2011, ECOWAS adopted a Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST). ECOPOST is an integral part of the subregion's development blueprint to 2020, entitled Vision 2020. Vision 2020 proposes a road map for improving governance, accelerating economic and monetary integration and fostering public‚Äìprivate partnerships. It endorses the planned harmonization of investment laws in West Africa and suggests pursuing ‚Äòwith vigour‚Äô the creation of a regional investment promotion agency. Countries are urged to promote efficient, viable small and medium-sized enterprises and to expose traditional agriculture to modern technology, entrepreneurship and innovation, in order to improve productivity. ECOPOST provides a framework for member states wishing to improve ‚Äì or elaborate for the first time ‚Äì their own national policies and action plans for science, technology and innovation. Importantly, ECOPOST includes a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the policy‚Äôs implementation, an aspect often overlooked. ECOPOST advocates the development of a science culture in all sectors of society, including through science popularization, the dissemination of research results in local and international journals, the commercialization of research results, greater technology transfer, intellectual property protection, stronger university‚Äìindustry ties and the enhancement of traditional knowledge. == Regional research centres == Two regional research centres have been set up in the city of Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, since 2010.  Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency  The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) established the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) in Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, in 2010. The centre has been established within the United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All programme. The mission of the centre is to create favourable framework conditions for renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in the 15 member states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Since its founding, there has been growing external demand for its services. Two other centres in sub-Saharan Africa will seek to replicate the ECREEE model. One will be established by UNIDO and the East African Community to serve Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. A second will serve the 15 Member States of the Southern Africa Development Community. Both centres should be fully operational by 2014. Other centres are being established within the same network in the Caribbean and Pacific.  West Africa Institute  The West Africa Institute was established in Praia (Cape Verde) in 2010 to provide the missing link between policy and research in the regional integration process. The institute is a service provider, conducting research for regional and national public institutions, the private sector, civil society and the media. The think tank also organizes political and scientific dialogues between policy-makers, regional institutions and members of civil society. There are ten research themes: * the historical and cultural bases of regional integration; * citizenship; * governance; * regional security; * economic challenges to market integration in West Africa; * new information and communication technologies; * education; * the problem of shared resources (land, water, minerals, coastal and maritime security); * funding of non-governmental organizations in West Africa; and * migration. The idea for the West Africa Institute emerged from 15 research workshops on the theme of regional integration organized in the ECOWAS member states by UNESCO‚Äôs Management of Social Transformations programme. In 2008, the Summit of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) unanimously endorsed the idea to create the West Africa Institute In 2009, UNESCO‚Äôs General Conference established the West Africa Institute as one of its category 2 institutes, which means that it functions under the auspices of UNESCO. A year later, the Government of Cape Verde passed a law establishing the institute in the capital. The institute is the fruit of a public‚Äìprivate partnership involving ECOWAS, the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UNESCO, the pan-African Ecobank and the Government of Cape Verde. == Sources  References == ","title":"Science and technology in Cape Verde"},{"id":"54253318","text":"Matthew Stuart Dominick (born December 7, 1981; LCDR, USN) is a US Navy test pilot and NASA astronaut.

He was also younger brother to the writer and dramaturge Alfred H. Unger. == Life == Wilhelm Unger was born in Hohensalza (today called Inowroc≈Çaw), at that time a small industrial town in the Prussian Province of Posen which since 1945 has been in the centre of Poland. His father, Dr. Samuel Unger, was a Jewish physician originally from Cologne. His mother, Flora Unger, had been born in Russia. In 1907, when he was just 3, the family moved back to Cologne which is where Unger completed his schooling and an apprenticeship in publishing and the book trade. He then moved on to study Germanistics, Philosophy and Psychology at Cologne and nearby Bonn. After this he worked for the K√∂lnische Zeitung (newspaper) and for the West German Radio service which had relaunched and relocated to Cologne from M√ºnster in 1926. His first book, \\"Beethovens Verm√§chtnis\\" (\\"Beethoven's Legacy\\") was published in 1929 but fell victim to government book burnings in 1933. The Nazi take- over in January 1933 ushered in twelve years during which antisemitism quickly became an integral underpinning of government strategy. As professional opportunities were closed off and racist street violence increased, many Jews fled abroad. The Unger family, initially, stayed in Germany. However, on 15 March 1939, as news services reported the German military invasion of Czechoslovakia, Wilhelm Unger fled to England, where his brother had been living since 1937. Their two sisters, Ella and Grete, would be murdered in concentration camps. The brothers discovered only in 1945 that their parents had outlived the Nazi regime, held in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. War across Europe broke out more generally during September 1939 and at the end of June 1940 the German air force launched a series of large scale nightly air attacks on English and Welsh cities. The British authorities now responded by suddenly identifying thousands of refugees from political and/or race based persecution in Nazi Germany as enemy aliens whom they arrested and locked up. Wilhelm Unger was arrested on 1 July 1940 in London and selected for transportation to Melbourne, Australia on board HMT Dunera which set sail from Liverpool on 10 July, carrying between 2,000 and 3,000 foreigners (sources differ) who had been classified as enemy aliens, looked after by 309 poorly trained guards. The voyage was not well planned or managed and the internees suffered serious abuse from their British guards. Wilhelm Unger still had with him the manuscript entitled \\"Cosmic Psychology\\" which he had rescued when he fled Germany, intending to have it published in London, for which arrangements had already been made; but during the voyage the manuscript was confiscated by one of the British guards and thrown overboard. Several of his Jewish fellow internees broke down because of the bad treatment and committed suicide. However, by the end of that summer reports of the atrocities had reached the British parliamentColonel Victor Cazalet, a Conservative MP, addressing the House of Commons on 22 August 1940: \\"Frankly I shall not feel happy, either as an Englishman or as a supporter of this government, until this bespattered page of our history has been cleaned up and rewritten.\\" and the authorities slowly began to rethink their policy of locking up the political and racially selected refugees from Nazi Germany. After intervention on his behalf by PEN International Wilhelm Unger was released and shipped back from Australia. Following another eventful voyage, on his arrival in Liverpool on 7 December 1941, in his own words, \\"I received the news about Pearl Harbor. The Japanese/American war had begun ... That meant that the war would not be over any time soon\\". He spent the next few years in London where there are indications that till the end of the war he worked for the \\"Culture Department\\" of the BBC. In October 1947 he visited Germany on behalf of the British military administration and attended the First German Wroters' Congress, which was held in Berlin (where the city's political and administrative divisions were not yet replicated by the physical barriers that would appear during the next four or five years). He arrived with a mandate from PEN International to identify twenty German authors of international repute, untainted by the nation's recent history, able to found a new German PEN centre. He was deeply shocked to see the extent of the destruction of the German cities and by the \\"inner emptiness of the war generation\\". It as not till 1956 that Wilhelm Unger returned to live in Cologne, where he worked for the \\"Feuilleton\\" supplement of the K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger (daily newspaper), also making contributions on WDR and on the international radio service Deutsche Welle, as national broadcasting in West Germany became increasingly focused on Cologne. He also wrote for the precursor to the J√ºdische Allgemeine weekly news magazine. As a commentator and theatre critic he used his influence to encourage young director-impresarios such as his friends Peter Zadek and J√ºrgen Flimm. Unger was a co-founder of the Cologne Association for Christian-Jewish Collaboration (1958) and of the Germania Judaica library (1959), together with Heinrich B√∂ll and Paul Schall√ºck.

In 1997 it was merged with the Swedish National Defence College and formed the \\"new\\" Swedish National Defence College. ==History== Location of the staff college at Valhallav√§gen 117, Stockholm. During the first part of the 20th century, the higher officer education was developed in the three military branches, the Army, Navy and Air Force. During the two world wars a variety of new weapons such as armor, air, gas, submarines and nuclear weapons were introduced. Then came the Cold War, which contributed so that the higher officer training at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College, the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College and the Royal Swedish Air Force Staff College in 1961 were merged into a joint staff college, named the Royal Swedish Armed Forces Staff College. The operations began on 1 October 1961 and the first instruction was established on 14 May 1964. It organized compulsory general courses, often military branch targeted and aimed for captain positions, as well as higher volunteer staff courses and technical courses. In 1992 the military branch programmes were incorporated and then there were the following programmes: Tactical Program (TAKLI), Staff Program (SLI), Technical Program (TEKLI) and Operational Program (OPLI). In 1994, the National School of Administration (F√∂rvaltningsh√∂gskolan, F√∂rvHS) was integrated with the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College, which became its own government agency. In 1995, parts of the Swedish National Defence Research Institute were transferred to the new Swedish Armed Forces Staff College. A special research area for security policy, strategy and military history was then established. In 1996, the government found that the link between civil and military defense had become increasingly important and, according to the government, there were strong reasons for the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College to merge with the Swedish National Defence College. The following year, the Swedish National Defence College and the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College were merged and formed the \\"new\\" Swedish National Defence College. The main part of the staff college was located at Valhallav√§gen 117 in Stockholm, in the chancellery building and barracks of the old Svea Artillery Regiment (A 1).

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. ==History== A fur trading depot was established at what is now Grand Haven in 1825; actual settlement was initiated in 1835 when Rev. William M. Ferry arrived and a sawmill was established at the site. One building in the district, the Sidney Williams House at 225 Franklin, likely dates from this first era of settlement in the late 1830s. As the lumber trade heated up, the settlement increased in size, and by 1851 was large enough to support a newspaper. The commercial center of the city quickly developed along Washington Avenue, starting from the harbor and working outward. Fires in 1853 and again in 1866 destroyed much of the downtown, and in 1877 the city passed a fire limit ordinance prohibiting buildings of wood construction in the heart of the downtown. A handful of private houses, built along the fringes of the downtown, date from the late 1850s and 1860s. The earliest extant commercial building in the district is the building at 135 Washington, constructed about 1868. By the 1880s, the lumber boom was nearly over, but fruit growing and commercial shipping took its place. More buildings were constructed in the downtown area, primarily in brick. As the end of the century neared, the building boom tapered off, in part due to the loss of local lumbering jobs, and in part due to the depressed national economy. In the early 20th century, the city's efforts at economic diversification paid off, with more manufacturing jobs coming into the city, and, with the establishment of a car ferry port, an increase in shipping and shipping-related trade. As a result, more buildings were constructed in the district in the first decade of the 20th century than in any other ten-year period. The city's population, and the number of buildings in the district, continued to grow through the 1920s and 1930s. The rise of the automobile, and the associated tourism, also helped boost the city's economy. The Great Depression affected Grand Haven less than most cities in the nation, but still the pace of growth in the historic district slowed. Grans Haven continued its growth after World War II. A number of structures built in this period were infill, replacing older buildings which had been demolished. In more modern times, Grand Haven has established itself as a vacation destination, and its downtown adds to the attraction of the city. The construction of infill buildings has continued, although recent structures have tended to be larger in scale, and not blending in with the earlier buildings. ==Description== The Grand Haven Historic District extends along six blocks of Washington Street, the city's primary business district. The district extends along adjacent streets to include the city hall, former police and fire department building, church buildings, and multiple substantial buildings constructed as residences, although many of these have been converted to commercial use. It also includes the large Story & Clark Piano Company complex, as well as early frame commercial buildings along Third Street. The district contains a total of 121 buildings, mostly two stories in height. The buildings date from c. 1840 to about 1965, but most were constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The city's Central Park is also within the district. Eighty-five of these properties, including the park, contribute to the historic nature of the district. The district contains substantially Late Victorian commercial blocks, but also a Period Revival movie theater, a Neoclassical former bank building, Italianate, Queen Anne houses, and International style and Mid-Century Modern structures. Significant architect-designed buildings within the district include: *Nathaniel Robbins House (1899) This house at 20 South 5th Street was built by Baltus Pellegrom, a ship's carpenter, for Nathaniel and Esther Robbins. Robbins was a successful area businessman. *Willard C. Shelden House (1893) This imposing house at 321 Washington is the finest Queen Anne house in the city. It was designed by architect William G. Robinson of Grand Rapids for Willard C. Shelden, the proprietor of Sheldon's Magnetic Mineral Springs spa. *First Reformed Church (1913) This church at 301 Washington was designed by architect Pierre Lindbout. It has an eclectic style, combining elements of Neoclassic architecture in a non-traditional way, resulting in an overall effect that reflects an Arts and Crafts influence. *Grand Theater lobby (1927) This theatre at 22 Washington was designed by Christian W. Brandt and Harold D. Ilgenfritz. Although the main section of the theatre itself was razed in 2004, the street facade and lobby were retained. *Michigan Bell Telephone Building (1928) This building at 501 Washington was designed by Smith, Hinchman & Grylls. It is a three-story Colonial building constructed of concrete block and clad with brick. The roof is flat, and the three bays at street level have broad gauged brick arches with masonry keystones. *City Hall (1934) This building at 519 Washington was designed by Robinson and Campau. It is a two-story Colonial building with a cross-gable roof. The main facade is symmetrical and seven bays wide, and contains a projecting front-gabled entry bay with a limestone portico. *Police and Fire Department Building (1935) This building at 18-20 North Fifth was also designed by Robinson and Campau. The original portion of the building is a 1-1/2-story rectangular plan gable-roof brick Colonial Revival building with a slate roof. A flat-roofed addition was constructed in 1975. *First Presbyterian Church (1954) This church at 508 Franklin was designed by Harold H. Fisher & Associates. It is an orange buff- colored brick structure trimmed with limestone with a low gable roof. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Historic District ","title":"Grand Haven Historic District"},{"id":"54253564","text":"Jacob Bicker (1588‚Äì1647) was a Dutch nobleman and merchant.

R. Sundaram of Modern Theatres. Directed by Wahab Kashmiri, it features K. L. V. Vasantha, T. S. Balaiah, T. S. Durairaj, K. K. Perumal, M. E. Madhavan and V. S. Susheela. The film was released on 30 March 1946 and failed commercially. ==Plot== A widowed police commissioner's daughter (Vasantha) falls in love with another police officer (Balaiah). Vasantha's father realises that a man has been committing treason by secretly sending radio messages to enemies, so he hires Balaiah to discover who it is. Balaiah, aided by two incompetent helpers (Durairaj and Madhavan), sets out to find the culprit, but the culprit imprisons them in an isolated bungalow. Unable to find Balaiah, Vasantha is devastated. She and her father make several efforts to locate Balaiah and his aids but fail. At the bungalow, one of Balaiah's aids finds a tie-pin, which is a gift from Vasantha to Balaiah. Balaiah throws it out through a keyhole. Vasantha finds it, after which her father and his men storm the bungalow, free Balaiah and later capture the culprit. Balaiah and Vasantha re-unite. ==Production== Chitra was launched in 1945, soon after World War II ended. Directed by Wahab Kashmiri, it was produced by T. R. Sundaram under the banner of Modern Theatres, with K. L. V. Vasantha, T. S. Balaiah, T. S. Durairaj, K. K. Perumal, M. E. Madhavan and V. S. Susheela as the lead actors.

The magazine Pesum Padam, then known for invoking English-language American films in the context of Sundaram's films, compared Sundaram's deft portrayal of the maid character Kannamma, \\"who steals the audience's hearts\\", with that of the minor characters in English films who often steal the show from the main actors. Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, author of the 2015 book Madras Studios, believes the invocation of \\"English films\\" was deliberate as the reviewer's intention to paint Sundaram's sensibilities as Western was very conspicuous. According to film historian Randor Guy, the film was not successful because of the \\"wrong casting\\" of Balaiah, then known for playing negative roles, in a heroic role, and audiences disliked seeing him \\"going about smartly dressed in suits\\" and holding a pipe. The song \\"Ahahahahaha...Aanandham\\", picturised on Vasantha, attained popularity. The film's theme of a man leaking secrets to enemies via radio was later used in Andha Naal (1954). ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:Indian spy thriller films Category:World War II films Category:World War II spy films Category:Films about kidnapping in India Category:Indian black-and-white films Category:1940s Tamil-language films Category:1940s thriller films ","title":"Chitra (1946 film)"},{"id":"54253810","text":"Dancing on the Edge Festival, Vancouver B.C., Canada is Canada's longest running contemporary dance festival.

It acts as competitive inhibitor of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase, 17Œ±-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, and 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, as well as of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, thereby inhibiting the production of steroid hormones including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. In addition, amphenone B inhibits the production of thyroxine by a thiouracil-like mechanism, specifically via inhibition of organic binding of iodine and uptake of iodide by the thyroid gland. Amphenone B was first synthesized in 1950 and is a diphenylmethane derivative that was derived from the insecticide 2,2-di(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (p,p'-DDD), which in 1949 had been found to selectively induce adrenal atrophy. In contrast to p,p'-DDD, which has direct cytotoxic effects on the adrenal glands via an unknown mechanism, amphenone B does not have cytotoxic effects, and instead causes adrenal and thyroid gland hypertrophy due to respective inhibition of corticosteroid and thyroxine biosynthesis, subsequent loss of negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary- thyroid axes, and consequent hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. Amphenone B has also been found to produce progesterone-like progestogenic effects, including uterine hypertrophy and mammary lobuloalveolar development. These effects occurred even in animals that had been ovariectomized and hypophysectomized, suggesting that amphenone B might be acting directly on the target organs. However, it was found that adrenalectomy abolished the progesterone-like effects of amphenone B on the uterus, whereas those of progesterone were retained in the same experimental conditions, supporting the notion that amphenone B was not actually acting directly on the uterus. Conversely, the progesterone-like effects of amphenone B on the mammary glands were found to persist even in adrenalectomized and ovariectomized animals. Amphenone B was tested in humans in the mid-1950s as a potential treatment for cortisol-dependent conditions such as Cushing's syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma. In healthy subjects and patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, the drug was found to be effective in decreasing circulating levels of corticosteroids including cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as in decreasing circulating levels of androgens and estrogens. Moreover, due to reduced aldosterone secretion, it caused marked diuresis and increased urinary sodium excretion. Unfortunately, amphenone B also caused many side effects, some severe, including drowsiness, gastrointestinal disturbances such as heartburn, nausea, and vomiting, morbilliform and pruritic rashes, methemoglobinemia, and hepatotoxicity including impaired liver function and hepatomegaly, and these toxicities, as well as the diversity of its effects on various organs (e.g., also possessing antithyroid and even anesthetic activity), precluded its therapeutic use. Subsequently, analogues of amphenone B with reduced toxicity and improved specificity were developed. One of the most potent of these was metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di(pyridin-3-yl)propan-1-one), a selective inhibitor of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase, which was selected for clinical development and was eventually approved and marketed in 1958 as a diagnostic agent for Cushing's syndrome. Another was mitotane (o,p'-DDD, or 1,1-(dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane), an inhibitor of cholesterol side- chain cleavage enzyme and to a lesser extent of other steroidogenic enzymes, which additionally has selective and direct cytotoxic effects on the adrenal glands similarly to p,p'-DDD, and was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. Aminoglutethimide (3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione), which was originally introduced as an anticonvulsant in 1960, is closely related structurally to amphenone B, and following its introduction, was found to cause adrenal insufficiency in patients due to inhibition of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and suppression of corticosteroid production. The drug was subsequently repurposed for use in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and Cushing's syndrome. Amphenone B was originally thought to be 1,2-bis(p-aminophenyl)-2-methylpropan-1-one, but it was discovered in 1957 that the synthesis of amphenone B was accompanied by an unexpected molecular rearrangement and that the drug was actually 3,3-bis-(p-aminophenyl)butan-2-one. As such, early publications of amphenone B, and some subsequent publications, refer to the drug by the incorrect structure. == See also == * Steroidogenesis inhibitor == References == Category:11Œ≤-Hydroxylase inhibitors Category:21-Hydroxylase inhibitors Category:Anilines Category:Antiestrogens Category:Antiglucocorticoids Category:Antimineralocorticoids Category:Antithyroid drugs Category:CYP17A1 inhibitors Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Ketones Category:Nonsteroidal antiandrogens ","title":"Amphenone B"},{"id":"54253826","text":"Flying Too High is a crime novel by Australian author Kerry Greenwood, and was published in 1990 by Penguin Books. It is the second novel by Kerry Greenwood that features the fictional detective Miss Phryne Fisher. == Introduction == Flying Too High, set in Melbourne, Australia in the 1920s, features fictional detective Phryne Fisher as she attempts to resolve a homicide case as well as solve the kidnapping of a small child. She is engaged by a woman who fears that her hot-tempered son, an aviation instructor, will kill his own father over a business dispute. Phryne first disarms the son by demonstrating her excellent flying skills and then advises him to calmly resolve the dispute with his father. Despite this warning, the father is murdered soon after, and Phyrne, along with her friends, Cec and Bert, her maid, Dot and fellow pilot Bunji Ross, attempt to help Melbourne's Detective Inspector Jack Robinson solve the crime. In addition, Phryne looks into a case of kidnapping concerning the child of a flying instructor, all while moving into her new house at 221B, The Esplanade, in Melbourne. This book also introduces two recurring characters in the Miss Fisher books by Kerry Greenwood; Mr and Mrs. Butler, who act as Phryne Fisher's butler and housekeeper respectively. == Plot summary == Having established herself as a private detective in Melbourne and solved a number of cases after the events in Cocaine Blues, Phryne Fisher is engaged by Mrs. William McNaughton to investigate a family dispute. Mrs. McNaughton expresses concerns that her hot-tempered son, Bill, might attempt to kill her husband William McNaughton following an altercation with them about business. Bill McNaughton runs a moderately unsuccessful flying school, in which his father is a principal investor and chairman of the board, and a vociferous opponent of Bill's plans to raise additional funds to fly over the North Pole. Phryne visits Bill McNaughton's flying school and dispels his initial doubts about her flying abilities by flying a series of tricky manoeuvres in his Gipsy Moth plane, culminating in a walk over the upper wings of the plane while Bill holds the plane steady in the air. Having impressed Bill, Phryne advises him to resolve matters with his father peacefully and avoid disturbing his mother, who is alarmed by their loud fighting. Soon after, Mr. William McNaughton is found murdered on his tennis court, and Mrs. McNaughton arrives at Phryne's house asking for her help in investigating the murder. While she is unconscious, Phryne looks through her belongings and finds letters suggesting that Mrs. McNaughton may have been engaging in an affair. Amelia McNaughton, her daughter, comes to retrieve her, and reveals to Phryne that she is engaged in a romance with an Italian sculptor, Paolo Rugazzi, and that her father, the deceased William McNaughton, was abusive and violent and had assaulted Amelia as well as her mother on several occasions. Phryne purchases some of Amelia's sketches, commissions a painting from her, and locates Mr. William McNaughton's will, which allows an inheritance to his wife and daughter on the condition that they do not marry. Amelia also tells her that she intends to marry her lover Paolo Rugazzi despite being aware of his infidelities as she loves him regardless. Along with Detective-Inspector Benton, Phryne visits the scene of crime where she learns that Mr. McNaughton was killed by a heavy blow to the head on his tennis court, and that a rock was identified as the murder weapon, and also that there may have been two witnesses who might be able to testify that Bill McNaughton was elsewhere while his father was being murdered. Phryne also discovers that Amelia frequently hosts local children to play on their property, a practice that her father abhors. Phryne engages her friend and lawyer, Jillian Henderson, to represent Bill McNaughton. She visits Paolo Rugazzi's studio, where he mistakes her for one of his models. Phryne poses in the nude for Paolo, allowing him to complete a difficult and beautiful sculpture, and culminating in their going to bed together. She then discloses to Rugazzi who she is, and confirms that she is looking after Amelia. Rugazzi explains to Phryne that while other women, including Phryne, are attractive, Amelia is his muse and will be for life, and describes his intentions to marry her. Phryne also confirms that Rugazzi is independently wealthy. Meanwhile, Jillian Henderson manages to secure bail for Bill Henderson and Phryne agrees to help Bill McNaughton prove his innocence provided he treats his sister Amelia and her fiance Paolo Rugazzi, as well as their mother, with respect and kindness. Phryne involves her friends and sometime investigative assistants, Burt and Cec, to track down the two witnesses. Acting on Phryne's instructions, Burt and Cec find the two witnesses, as well as the correct murder weapons. Phryne solves a small side-question of a kidnapping and then diverts herself by successfully seducing Dr. Fielding, a local doctor who had attended to Mrs. McNaughton. Phryne convinces Amelia McNaughton to have a small party and invite the local children that she occasionally her family, Paolo Rugazzi, Detective-Inspector Benton, Bert and Cec. There, she demonstrates that Mr. McNaughton's death was caused by an accident that resulted from a game played by the local children. The children had been attempting to build a pyramid in imitation of the recently discovered pyramids of Luxor, and had attached a large stone to a rope hanging from a tree. Mr McNaughton, enraged by their presence on his property, went to rebuke them, resulting in their panicking and releasing the rope and stone, which swung and delivered a blow that killed him. The police were then lead off track because Amelia McNaughton, finding her father's body, assumed her brother had killed him and attempted to hide the evidence. The police agree to not lay charges against either the children or Amelia McNaughton, and Jillian Henderson ensures that neither Mrs. McNaughton nor Amelia are denied their inheritances. A subplot concerns the abduction of Candida Alice Maldon, a six-year-old child and the daughter of Henry Maldon, a flying instructor. Candida slips out of her house without her parents' knowledge to buy sweets at a shop down the road, but is abducted on her way home by strangers in a black car. Her stepmother Molly Maldon finds the abandoned packet of sweets while hunting for Candida and manages to retrace her steps, confirming that Candida may have been kidnapped. Henry Maldon had previously been confirmed as the winner of the Irish Christmas Lottery. After receiving a ransom message from the kidnappers, Henry Maldon is persuaded by his friend and fellow flying instructor Jack Leonard to ask Phryne Fisher for help. Phryne promptly agrees to help. Phryne enlists the help of Detective Inspector Jack Robinson in tracing fingerprints on the ransom note and it is discovered that one of the sets of finger-prints belong to a man suspect of molesting children, Sidney Brayshaw. He also helps her trace the owners of the car used to kidnap Candida Maldon: a young couple, Mike and Ann. Ann's expensive habits had led them into debt and blackmail, leading Ann and a reluctant Mike to collaborate with Sid on the kidnapping. Along with the pilot Jack Leonard, Phryne launches a dangerous plot to retrieve Candida. A decoy package of newspapers disguised with some currency is used to bait the kidnappers, and Phryne straps herself to their car and leaves a trail of luminous paint behind. Bunji Ross and Henry Maldon use a light aircraft and a torchlight to trace Phryne's trail of luminous paint, bringing them to the kidnappers' den without attracting their attention. Phryne climbs off the back of the car and rescues Candida. She is aided by Mike, who was disgusted to discover Sid was a child-molester and that his wife's spending had led them into debt and blackmail, and changes his mind about the kidnapping. Phryne releases Mike and tricks Sid into keeping quiet about it. == Characters == Recurring Characters * The Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher: a wealthy private detective * Dorothy 'Dot' Williams: Phryne's maidservant and social secretary * Bert (Albert Johnson) and Cec (Cecil Yates): cab drivers in Melbourne who occasionally act as investigative assistants to Phryne * Mr and Mrs. Butler: Phryne's newly engaged butler and housekeeper, respectively * Jillian Henderson: a lawyer, and Phryne Fisher's friend * Detective-Inspector 'Theory' Benton: a police officer investigating the murder of William McNaughton.

A founding member of the Banana Garden Poetry Club, Lin Yining was also an avid painter and composer. ==Life and career== Lin Yining was born in 1655, near the Zhejiang section of the Zhe River. Her father Lin Lun was a jinshi, and her mother introduced her to classical Chinese literature. She was \\"very talented and could write poetry and prose\\"; additionally, Lin dabbled in calligraphy and was \\"especially well-versed in drawing bamboo in ink and wash\\". She married Qian Zhaoxi, who worked at the local censorate and was also acquainted with traditional Chinese opera. While they were based in Luoyang, the couple would write each other love poems that were later compiled into an anthology titled Collected Works of Fengxiao Tower. Qian's mother, Gu Zhiqiong, was instrumental in bringing together talented female poets, and at her behest, the \\"Banana Garden Five\\" (), comprising Lin, Zhu Rouze, Chai Jingyi, Qian Yunyi, and Xu Can, was formed. The group later became the Banana Garden Seven () and its roster was changed to include Lin, Qian, Mao Anfang, Feng Youling, Gu Jiji, Zhang Chayun, and Chai Jingyi. Lin penned the preface to Hangzhou poet Liang Ying's Every Fragrant Word that collects Liang's poems on plum blossoms. A lost play titled Wisteria Pass was allegedly written by Lin. Lin and Qian had two children a son, Qing, and a daughter, Tao, neither of whom, according to Lin herself, \\"dared\\" to take up Chinese literature. It is not known for certain when Lin Yining died, but the Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women, citing an unspecified source, gives her death year as 1730. According to an entry on Lin Yining in Women Writers of Traditional China, \\"Lin's poetry is distinguished by its direct and fluent diction, and vivid visual imagery\\". She is also praised for presenting her \\"personal interests\\" in her poetry, and not adhering to the \\"conventional themes and scenarios derived from literati construction of feminine voices\\". ==References== Citations Bibliography * * Category:1655 births Category:1730 deaths Category:Qing dynasty poets Category:Chinese women poets Category:17th-century Chinese women Category:18th-century Chinese women ","title":"Lin Yining"},{"id":"54253950","text":"The canton of Tarn et Causses is an administrative division of the Aveyron department, southern France.

The Machen Loop Act 1887 authorised the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway to double the B&MTJR;'s Caerphilly branch. Accordingly, a new 'down' line was laid on a divergent route to Machen from Gwaun-y-Bara Junction. The former single line became the new 'up' line, and came into use in 1891. The PC&NR; opened to passenger services in 1904. After Machen became a junction, it had many sidings, some of which were used by local businessmen. The local collier's trains were always parked in the north siding. Machen also had a carriage works, built originally in 1870 and expanded in 1900, 1911 and 1922.

During his school years, he was mostly interested in literature and history rather than in physical sciences. Due to the start of World War II and the death of his mother in 1943, E. Silinsh was forced to discontinue his education; nevertheless, in 1946 he took secondary school exams and enrolled at the Faculty of Chemistry of the State University of Latvia (SUL). The choice for natural sciences was rooted in Edgar's awareness of humanities being ideologically constrained in the Soviet Union. Yet he was forced to cease his studies even in the field of chemistry during the Stalinist repressions of 1949, because of class-based mistreatment. After that, E. Silinsh worked as a laborant for 14 years, and for last 12 of these he was employed at the Central Laboratory of the Riga Plant of Electrical Machine Building (). At this institution, E. Silinsh could for the first time perform actual scientific research, mostly in the field of atomic spectroscopy. In 1958, his two messages were included in the X All-Union Spectroscopy Conference in Lvov.–û —Å–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–¥—É–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ—á–Ω—ã—Ö –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏ —Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–µ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–µ–π. –ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –• —Å–æ–≤–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ —Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å–∫–æ–ø–∏–∏, –õ—å–≤–æ–≤, 1958. ‚Äî –õ—å–≤–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, 1959. ‚Äî —Å. 414‚Äî417.–†. –ö–∞—Ä–∫–ª–∏–Ω—å—à, –ê. –ö. –ü–∞—ç–≥–ª–µ, –≠. –ê. –°–∏–ª–∏–Ω—å—à. –ü—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—è –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ª–∏–º–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫–∏—Å–ª–æ—Ç—ã. –¢—Ä—É–¥—ã –í—Å–µ—Å–æ—é–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ù–ò–ò –∫–æ–Ω–¥–∏—Ç–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, 1959, 12, 53‚Äî56. In total, Edgar Silinsh published 26 scientific and technical papers in the field of atomic and molecular spectroscopy during his years at RER, as well as 16 technical and technological publications of other kinds. During the \\"Khrushchev Thaw\\", Edgar Silinsh was finally able to enroll (in 1957) and graduate (in 1961) the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Latvia. In 1962, he began his extramural studies for the Candidate of Sciences degree (equivalent to the Western PhD) at the S. Vavilov State Optical Institute in Leningrad and defended in June 1965. His Candidate thesis topic was influence of plasma and contact discharge on the emission spectra of metal atoms (doctoral advisor K. Taganov). In 1963, the founder of Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis Solomons Hillers proposed to create a joint research group of chemists and physicists in Riga to study electrophysical properties of organic compounds. Edgar Silinsh was appointed the head of this research group. Between 1963 and 1967 he was a researcher at the Laboratory of Semiconductor Physics Problems, SUL, whereas beginning with the year 1967 he led the Laboratory of Physics of Organic Semiconductors (later the Laboratory of Organic Solid State Physics and Molecular Electronics) at the Institute of Physical Energetics, Latvian Academy of Science. Until 1975, a new model was developed under his lead, describing the physical nature of local structure- determined charge-carrier trapping centers in organic molecular crystals. The most important publication of this period (71 Scopus citations) ushered in the collaboration with professor of the New York University Martin Pope and professor of Japanese National Institute of Natural Sciences , later also with professor of the University in Plzen Stanislav Ne≈°p≈Ørek. In the following years, Edgar Silinsh took interest in the problems of organic solid state energetics and proved that the conventional band theory is inapplicable to molecular solids. A new, improved phenomenological model was also developed to describe these peculiarities. In 1978, these conclusions were summarized in a monograph,–≠. –ê. –°–∏–ª–∏–Ω—å—à. –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º–æ–ª–µ–∫—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞–ª–ª–æ–≤. –ó–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω–µ: –†–∏–≥–∞, 1978. ‚Äî 344 —Å. year later E.

The last one is the most cited work of Edgar Silinsh in his whole life (218 citations as of June 2017), and Silinsh himself was once credited as the most cited Latvian author. In the early 1980s, Edgar Silinsh was interested particularly in photogeneration mechanisms in organic semiconductors.Lielo patiesƒ´bu meklƒìtƒÅjs Edgars Imants Sili≈Ü≈°. In memoriam. Latv. J. Phys. Tech. Sci. 1998, 4, pp. 4‚Äî9. ISSN 0868-8257 (Latvian) In 1985, E. Silinsh published the molecular polaron model describing the lattice polarization effect on charge carriers; together with coworkers A. Jurƒ£is and G. ≈†lihta developed the modified Sano‚ÄîMozumder model to describe the transfer of charge-carriers in the molecular semiconductor. Scientific endeavor of Edgar Silinsh embraced vast collaboration with the chemists of Riga Polytechnical Institute (later Riga Technical University) led by professor O. Neilands, as well as with the chemists of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, led by professor J. Freimanis. Total number of Edgar Silinsh's publications and scientific reports exceeds 200, in addition to six monographs, talks at over 20 scientific conferences and more than 50 lectures in the scientific establishments abroad. He has 710 citations listed in Scopus and h-index of 15. Edgar Silinsh was a member of American Physical Society, the Rotary club and some other international organizations; since 1992 ‚Äî full member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences (LAS). Edgars Imants Sili≈Ü≈° died on 26 May 1998, and is buried at the Lƒ´gatne cemetery. In the same year, the Prize in the field of Physics devoted to him was established by the LAS. In 2004, in front of the Institute of Physical Energetics (Aizkraukles St. 21, Riga) a monument to Edgar Silinsh was erected, designed by sculptors Juris Rapa and Zigrƒ´da Rapa. with reference to: SpƒÅrƒ´tis, O. Rƒ´gas pieminekƒºi un dekoratƒ´vƒÅ tƒìlniecƒ´ba. Rƒ´ga, 2007. == Views and works in philosophy of science == Edgar Silinsh had much interest in Oriental philosophy (daoism, zen-buddhism), as well as in the traditional Japanese culture. He also revered the works of Niels Bohr in the field of philosophy of science, as well as (in the philosophical context) works of Dutch graphic artist Maurits Escher. In the year following the death of E. Silinsh, Jumava publishing house put in print his collection of essays on the matter, named \\"The Quest for the Great Truths\\" (). == List of monographs == * –û. –ù–µ–π–ª–∞–Ω–¥, –Ø. –°—Ç—Ä–∞–¥—ã–Ω—å, –≠. –°–∏–ª–∏–Ω—å—à –∏ –¥—Ä. –°—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Ç–∞—É—Ç–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è Œ≤‚Äì–¥–∏–∫–∞—Ä–±–æ–Ω–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π. –ó–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω–µ: –†–∏–≥–∞, 1977, 444.—Å. * –≠. –°–∏–ª–∏–Ω—å—à. –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º–æ–ª–µ–∫—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞–ª–ª–æ–≤. –ó–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω–µ: –†–∏–≥–∞, 1978, 344.—Å. * E.

Their focus in 2009 was the \\"development of a new generation of immune response modifier for potential use in the treatment of a range of infectious diseases, certain cancers, and as a novel cellular and humoral adjuvant, \\" and developed a proprietary multiple sclerosis drug, MIS416. In April 2009 the firm changed its name to Innate Immunotherapeutics to reflect their focus on the development of MIS416, and moved their headquarters from Auckland, New Zealand to Sydney, Australia. Contact Joan E. Kureczka, Kureczka/Martin Associates, MSEM Founder and Principal and the Vivant Group, San Francisco, California On June 22, 2017, Innate Immunotherapeutics announced that the MIS416 clinical trials undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in managing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), had \\"failed to show any clinically meaningful benefit or statistical significance.\\" These findings resulted in the stocks crashing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Innate Immunotherapeutics received media attention in 2018 after its majority owner US Congressman Chris Collins was arrested for insider trading. In September, 2018, the company changed its name to Amplia Therapeutics Limited. ==History== In 2009, Gill Webster, Ph.D., was Innate Therapeutics' chief scientific officer. By 2009, MIS416 had \\"shown promising activity in preclinical proof-of-principle studies in cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases In a 2009 article published by BioPharm International, researchers discussed the potential of the then-novel, MIS416 adjuvant as a therapeutic vaccine \\"for patients with cancer or acquired chronic infections, such as HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and malaria\\". MIS416 is \\"a myeloid-directed microparticle immune response modifier (derived from Cutibacterium acnes), which was originally developed as a vaccine adjuvant.\\"96\\\\.

[PMC free article] [PubMed] [Cross Ref] White, O'Sullivan, Stone and La Flamme also found that MIS416 \\"[suppressed] the development of proinflammatory T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cells in EAE, and [increased] the serum levels of IFN-Œ≥ and IFN-Œ≥-associated proteins in 19 patients with SPMS.\\" \\"MIS416 was initially used in patients with SPMS outside of a formal clinical trial setting under compassionate use legislation in New Zealand.\\" Shirani also reported in 2016, that a \\"phase IIb trial [was] underway to further investigate the effect of MIS416 in progressive forms of MS (NCT02228213)\\". On June 22, 2017, Innate Immunotherapeutics announced that the MIS416 clinical trials had \\"failed to show any clinically meaningful benefit or statistical significance.\\" Their stocks immediately crashed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). On August 31, Innate Immunotherapeutics CEO announced that the firm would be closing over the next few months. Innate's board of directors included Chairman Warwick Tong, CEO Simon Wilkinson, Robert Peach, Christian Behrenbruch, Christopher Burns, and Andrew J. Cooke. ==Chris Collins involvement== Innate Immunotherapeutics's largest stockholder by August 2016, the United States congressman Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), had begun investing in the company in 2002. Over the years Collins raised money for the company and was invited to serve on its board of directors. In August 2016 Collins purchased 4 million more shares in Innate Immunotherapeutics making him the largest shareholder. At the same time Tom Price, who until 29 September 2017 was the 23rd United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, purchased 400,613 Innate Immunotherapeutics shares valued at $100,000 to $250,000. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) raised potential concerns about Price's Innate Immunotherapeutics investments which \\"could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress.\\" By June 8, 2017, Collins had announced that Innate's drug had just \\"completed a Phase 2B clinical trial\\", and Innate Immunotherapeutics \\"hopes to sell off the product later [in 2017].\\" On June 22, 2017, Collins learned through a \\"private email from [Innate Immunotherapeutics]' chief executive that the clinical trials for the \\"potentially lucrative experimental drug had failed.\\" Collins' son, Cameron Collins, who held Innate Immunotherapeutics shares, avoided over $570,000 in losses by selling his stocks on June 22, after his father had warned him that the Phase 2B clinical trials had failed. By June 8, 2017 the price per share in the United States' over-the-counter (OTC) market of INNMF, had dropped to 58 cents per share\\". By June 27, it was reported that Collins, who was the largest INNMF stockholder, \\"incurred a paper loss of nearly $17 million\\". In May 2017, White House ethics investigators \\"began probing Collins for his role in recruiting investors to buy stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics after several complaints were filed\\". Members of Congress are explicitly barred from trading stocks using insider information.\\" In October 2017, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) said they had \\"substantial reason\\" to believe that Collins had improperly used his public office to benefit Innate, and had forwarded nonpublic information to other investors. On August 8, 2018, Collins, his son Cameron, and Cameron's fianc√©e's father Stephen Zarsky were arrested on insider trading charges. Collins resigned on October 1, 2019, the day before he pleaded guilty to insider trading. He was sentenced to 26 months in prison, while Cameron was sentenced to probation and community service. ==MIS416== MIS416 is a vaccine adjuvant and \\"immunogen co-delivery system\\". In 2011, in an NIH publication MIS416 was described as a \\"non-toxic microparticle adjuvant derived from Propionibacterium acnes comprising immunostimulatory muramyl dipeptide and bacterial DNA promotes cross-priming and Th1 immunity\\". In 2015, Innate Immunotherapeutics described it as an \\"immunomodulator\\" for \\"patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis\\". Clinical trials Innate Immunotherapeutics undertook a 12-month clinical study (NCT02228213) with 13 patients with early funding from the research arm, Fast Forward LLC, of the National MS Society in the U.S. In 2016, the Phase 2B, placebo- controlled clinical trial of MIS416 which includes nine patients from the original trial, was underway. Research on MIS416 is undertaken in collaboration with Raleigh, North Carolina's INC Research under the tenure of CEO Alistair Macdonald. == Renamed to Amplia Therapeutics == On September 5, 2018, Innate Immunotherapeutics changed their name to Amplia Therapeutics (Stock Code ASX: ATX) ==References== Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Australia ","title":"Innate Immunotherapeutics"},{"id":"54254223","text":"Muhammad Rezaldi Hehanusa (born 7 November 1995) is an Indonesian professional footballer who plays as a left back for Liga 1 club Persija Jakarta and the Indonesia national team. ==Career== Persija Jakarta Rezaldi is joined Persija Jakarta for 2016 Indonesia Soccer Championship A.

Each episode featured a story surrounding popular culture which may or may not be true, ranging from Muhammad Ali talking a man down from a ledge to Bob Dylan turning up on a stranger's doorstep in London. A second series was announced featuring The Sex Pistols and Salvador Dali, which began airing on 12 April 2018. The series was most notable for a controversy surrounding the casting of Joseph Fiennes in the role of Michael Jackson, an episode that was pulled from transmission. ==Episodes== Series 1 (2017) Series 2 (2018) Series 3 (2019) == Reception == Although stories surrounding the pulled episode overshadowed the rest of the series, the aired episodes attracted a positive response. In particular the opening episode, featuring Eddie Marsan as Bob Dylan, was described in approving newspaper reviews as \\"charming and hilarious\\", \\"short, charming and light-hearted\\" and \\"different and pleasing\\". The series drew over 600,000 viewers and charted in the top three programmes for Sky Arts each week it aired, save for the episode \\"Cary Grant and Timothy Leary\\", which came seventh, largely due to broadcasts of the programme Portrait Artist of the Year.  Controversy  After it was revealed that Joseph Fiennes was to portray Michael Jackson in the series, several members of Jacksons' family objected, including his daughter, Paris Jackson, who wrote on Twitter, \\"I'm so incredibly offended by it, as i'm sure plenty of people are as well, and it honestly makes me want to vomit.\\" The tweet was later deleted. After widespread criticism following the release of the series trailer, the episode was pulled from broadcast indefinitely.  Accolades  {  - ! Year !! Award !! Category !! Nomination !!

She was founder and superior for the monastery at Roberval, Quebec. ==Biography== The daughter of Joseph Gagn√©, master pilot, and Luce Mercier, she was born in Saint-Michel and was educated there. Her father died when she was two and her mother became a seamstress to support the family. Four years later, Gagn√©'s mother married a sailor Prudent Lacombe. At the age of 15, Gagn√© began teaching on the √éle d‚ÄôOrl√©ans. The following year, she returned home to continue her studies. She began teaching at Isle-Verte when she was 17. In 1860, she entered the Ursuline monastery in Quebec City. In 1863, she took her vows as a nun. She studied at the normal school run by the Ursulines, excelling in mathematics. In 1878, she was made mistress of the noviciate at Chatham, Ontario. She returned to Quebec City in 1880 and was sent to the Lac Saint-Jean region in spring 1882; her mission was to found a monastery at Roberval to encourage religious vocations and educate young girls. Gagn√© adjusted the curriculum to meet local needs, educating young women in farming and domestic science. Graduates from this program could also take examinations to qualify for a teaching certificate.

The law also added additional lands to four existing Wilderness Areas in New Mexico, and named several Forest areas for study as potential Wilderness Areas. The law also created two new National Park Service units, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and Salinas National Monument, from existing NPS lands. By means of this law approximately 400,000 acres of forest land were designated as Wilderness Areas, as described by the Wilderness Act of 1964, and approximately 75,000 additional acres were designated as Wilderness Study Areas for possible future inclusion in the Wilderness program. ==Background== Responding to a heightened public interest in conservation and an increased threat to public lands by development, and other intrusive or consumptive activities, such as logging, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964, Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S.C. 1131-1136) on September 3, 1964. http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/legisact Created, in the words of the law, \\"to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness,\\" the law created the National Wilderness Preservation System and a set of criteria and administrative processes by which natural areas could be added to this system.16 U.S.C. 1131-1136 Under this new law, proposed areas on U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could be designated as Wilderness Areas, special reserves protected from human encroachment and development. Within these areas, unless specially exempted, Congress mandated that there \\"shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area...there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area.\\" To be kept in as close to a pristine natural state as possible, these areas would only be open to hikers and backpackers, who would be expected to follow low-impact, \\"pack-in/pack out\\" camping practices.16 U.S.C. 1131-1136 ==Legislative History== What would eventually become Public Law 96-550 was first proposed to the House of Representatives by Manuel Lujan Jr., the representative of New Mexico's 1st Congressional District on October 2, 1980. Designated House Resolution 8298 (96th) the bill was discussed in both the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees before being approved on November 21, 1980, six weeks after its introduction. After passing through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the bill was passed in identical form to the House version on December 1, 1980. Eighteen days later, on December 19, 1980, the bill, now known as the New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980, was signed by the President.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/96/hr8298 ==Title I== Title 1, Section 102 of the new law authorized the establishment of nine new Wilderness Areas and the addition of lands to three existing Wilderness Areas on National Forest land in New Mexico.94 stat. 3221 Title I, Section 102 Map of the Apache Kid and Withington Wilderness Areas, Cibola National Forest The Wilderness Areas established included: *The 211,300 acre Aldo Leopold Wilderness in the Gila National Forest *The 45,000 acre Apache Kid Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest *The 30,000 acre Blue Range Wilderness in the Gila National Forest *The 34,000 acre Capitan Mountains Wilderness in the Lincoln National Forest *The 5,200 acre Dome Wilderness in the Santa Fe National Forest *The 20,000 acre Latir Peak Wilderness in the Carson National Forest *The 19,000 acre Withington Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest *The 18,000 acre Cruces Basin Wilderness in the Carson National Forest Additional lands were added to the following existing Wilderness Areas, including: *140,000 acres added to the Gila Wilderness in the Gila National Forest *14,7000 acres added to the Wheeler Peak Wilderness in the Carson National Forest *16,806 acres added to the White Mountain Wilderness in the Lincoln National Forest *55,000 acres added to the Pecos Wilderness in the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests Title I, Section 103 of the law instructed the Secretary of Agriculture, as the official responsible for the Forest Service and the implementation of the Wilderness Act of 1964 to examine five proposed Wilderness Study Areas to determine their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation system. The law further stated that the Secretary's findings should be presented to the Senate and the President no later than January 1, 1986.94 stat. 3221 Title I, Section 103 The areas proposed for study included: *The 15,110 acre Bunk Robinson Wilderness Study Area in the Coronado National Forest *The 16,000 acre Columbine-Hondo Wilderness Study Area in the Carson National Forest *The 18,860 acre Hell Hole Wilderness Study Area in the Gila National Forest *The 8,800 acre Lower San Francisco Wilderness Study Area in the Gila National Forest *The 7,760 acre Whitmire Canyon Wilderness Study Area in the Coronado National Forest Panoramic view of the Gila Wilderness, Gila National Forest ==Title II== Title II of the law authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to create, in conjunction with the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, the Langmuir Research Site in the Cibola National Forest. Noting that the \\"high altitude and freedom from air pollution and night luminosity caused by human activity\\" made the Forest \\"uniquely suited to the conduct of research probes into thunder clouds and for other atmospheric and astronomical research purposes,\\" the law authorized the use of 31,000 acres of the Cibola National Forest for research use.94 stat. 3221 Title II ==Titles III and IV== These two short sections of the law authorized the payment of not more than $20,000 to reimburse Albert and Eulalaia Rodriquez for improvements on land within the Taos Pueblo Grant, and gave the Secretary of the Interior the authority to amend the contract between the Vermejo Conservancy District, a Bureau of Reclamation irrigation project near Maxwell, New Mexico and the federal government.94 stat. 3221 Title III/IV ==Title V== The Great Kiva, Chaco Culture N.H.P. Title V of the law authorized the re-designation of the Chaco Canyon National Monument to Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Established in 1933, Chaco Canyon National Monument was created to preserve the very large collection of Ancestral Puebloan dwellings, kivas, and primitive roads located in and around Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico. In 1980, recognizing the importance of the archaeological research being done in and around Chaco Canyon and the increased public interest in the Ancient Puebloan people Congress authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to designate 31 outlying areas Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites. Meant to protect these potentially valuable sites from encroachment from energy-related exploration and development, the law authorized the Secretary of Interior, as the official responsible for the National Park Service, to enter into co- operative agreements with land holders to protect, preserve, maintain, and administer these sites, or if under imminent threat of damage or destruction, to seek title to these lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange.94 stat. 3221 Title V ==Title VI== Ruins at Gran Quivira, Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument The last section of the law authorized the establishment of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument near Mountainair, New Mexico. To create this new unit, the law abolished the nearby Gran Quivira National Monument, assigned its 611 acres to the new park, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire an additional 466 acres near Mountainair, and gave permission for the Secretary to acquire other lands as might be need to complete the unit. Protecting both the ancient Native American ruins and the Missions built in the area by the Spanish, the new park combined the ruins at Gran Quivira, Abo, and Quaraiin into a single administrative unit, with its headquarters in Mountainair.94 stat. 3221 Title VI ==See also== *Wilderness Act of 1964 ==External links== *Wilderness.net *New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980 ==References== Category:96th United States Congress Category:United States federal public land legislation Category:1980 in American law Category:1980 in New Mexico Category:Wilderness Areas of the United States ","title":"New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980"},{"id":"54254331","text":"Rodrigue Ele (born 2 March 1998) is a Cameroonian footballer who played for Seattle Sounders FC 2 in the United Soccer League. == Career ==  Youth  Ele played for the youth and development academy of Rainbow Bamenda of the Cameroonian Elite One.

It debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200, however, it reached as high as number 4 on the US Top Rock Albums chart and at number 3 on the US Independent Albums chart. == Recording == Recording for their sixth album initially took place in New York in the fall of 2016. The band had wanted to record in the city for a while and Pat suggested taking a week to fly out and find a space to work in. They set out with producer Colby Wedgeworth and recorded at the Brooklyn Patch - a house with a built-in studio made specifically for bands to record/write in. Satisfied with their New York experience but searching for more inspiration, the guys ended up at an Airbnb in Gualala, California. The home was transformed into a recording space in the mountains, overlooking the ocean. The recording process was documented by the band and made into a mini YouTube series which they titled \\"Miserable Youth\\". == Release == After a series of teasers on their social media accounts, The Maine announced their upcoming album on January 15, 2017. Four days later, \\"Bad Behavior\\" was made available for streaming. On January 20, the group headlined 8123 Fest. A music video was released for \\"Bad Behavior\\" on February 23. On March 2, \\"Black Butterflies and D√©j√† Vu\\" was made available for streaming. On March 26, the group released a clip of \\"How Do You Feel?\\". On March 29, \\"Do You Remember? (The Other Half of 23)\\" was made available for streaming. Preceded by a one- off show in the UK, the group embarked on a North American tour in March and April. The band organized small pop-up shops throughout select cities of the tour to sell merchandise and give fans a chance to connect with them while on the road. Lovely Little Lonely was released on April 7. \\"Just hearing the people sing songs off the record before this and our most recent record way louder than any of the older songs is kind of insane. It just feels good to go out there and have people respond this way, to what we‚Äôre doing\\" says the band about the release of new material and touring. On May 26, the group released an acoustic version of \\"Bad Behavior\\". Following two shows in Asia in June, the group went on a tour of Brazil in July. In July and August, the group supported Dashboard Confessional on their headlining US tour. On August 17, a music video was released for \\"Taxi\\". In October and November, the group embarked on The Modern Nostalgia Tour where they performed Lovely Little Lonely and American Candy in their entirety. They were supported by Dreamers and Night Riots. == Reception == The album was quickly met with overall praise from fans and music critics alike. Jesse Richman of Alternative Press writes \\"The result is an album that feels timeless, even on first impact. It‚Äôs the Maine‚Äôs best batch of songs since Pioneer, their catchiest material since Can‚Äôt Stop Won‚Äôt Stop and their most cohesive work to date\\". The Maine is constantly evolving and changing their sound ever so slightly and luckily fans continue to demand more music and tour dates.

There was a substantial stone building on one, with the other supplied with only a shelter. Initially a small and insignificant halt (though the suffix 'halt' did not begin appearing util the 1900s), Church Road grew in importance and a telephone kiosk was installed in 1891, together with the larger waiting room. For many years, the station's flowerbeds had its name spelt out in bedding plants Despite this, the station's patronage slumped in the post-war years. It closed to both passengers and freight in 1957, having been unstaffed for a number of years. The larger station building is now a private residence, though the second platform was gone by 1974. ==References== Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1865 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1957 Category:Disused railway stations in Caerphilly County Borough Category:1865 establishments in Wales Category:1957 disestablishments in Wales ","title":"Church Road (B&amp;MJR) railway station"},{"id":"54254460","text":"The Crypt Sessions is a classical music concert series that takes place in the crypt of the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, New York City.

He made his professional debut in March 2007, and reached the top makuuchi division in September 2016. His highest rank has been maegashira 13. He has one j≈´ry≈ç division championship or y≈´sh≈ç. He wrestles for Oguruma stable. ==Career== He had been active in judo since before elementary school, and won the Shikoku junior high school competition. He was spotted by former ozeki Kotokaze and recruited to his Oguruma stable at the age of 15. He made his debut in March 2007, fighting under his own surname of Kawanari. He was the first wrestler from Kagawa Prefecture since the retirement of Gokenzan in November 2006. He reached the sandanme division in 2008 and the third highest makushita division in 2009. He rose to the top of the makushita division in March 2013, where he was on the verge of promotion to elite sekitori status but fell short with a make-koshi or losing 1‚Äì6 record. He failed again at makushita 3 in November 2013, and then missed the January 2014 tournament through injury. After making attempts to lose weight his results began to improve and he earned promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division after the January 2015 tournament. To celebrate his promotion to sekitori status he changed his shikona from his real name to Amakaze. He chose the shikona himself, with \\"kaze\\" (wind) being a suffix used by all wrestlers at Oguruma stable, and \\"Ama\\" taken from Amanogawa (the Milky Way), because his birthday of July 7 co-incides with the start of Tanabata (Star Festival) celebrations. The same kanji is also used for a river near his parents' home in Kotohira. He commented on his new name, \\"It means looking up to the heavens, it's good\\" but his stablemaster joked that he should take care not to become an \\"Ama-chan\\", or one who takes things lightly. Amakaze came through with a winning record in his second division debut of ten wins against five losses, and in July 2016 he won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship or y≈´sh≈ç with a 13‚Äì2 record. This earned him promotion to the top makuuchi division for the first time, joining his veteran stablemates Takekaze and Yoshikaze. Working his way up the ranks Amakaze had served as a tsukebito, or personal attendant to Takekaze. Ranked at maegashira 13 in his makuuchi debut in September 2016, he managed only five wins against ten losses and was demoted straight back to j≈´ry≈ç. For the next eight tournaments he held his own in j≈´ry≈ç but did not look like earning promotion back to makuuchi. In March 2018 a poor 3‚Äì12 record caused his demotion to makushita which he followed up with another poor 2‚Äì6 record in May 2018. He injured his knee in his first bout in July 2018 and withdrew from the tournament. He did not compete again until March 2019, by which time he had fallen to the jonidan division. In this tournament he fought another former makuuchi wrestler, Terunofuji. ==Personal== Amakaze is known for his sense of fun and love of food, and enjoys posting photos of himself and fellow wrestlers at leisure on social media. In 2015 a video of himself, Takatenshu and Kaiho attempting a 40-yard dash while on a tour in Wakayama went viral. ==Fighting style== Amakaze is one of the heaviest wrestlers in sumo at , and likes to use his weight to his best advantage by grabbing his opponent's mawashi and forcing them out by yori- kiri. His preferred grip is hidari-yotsu, a right arm outside, left arm inside position. Roughly half of his winning bouts are with the yori-kiri technique. His other regular winning kimarite include oshi-dashi (push out) and hataki- komi (slap down). ==Career recordSee also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers *List of sumo second division tournament champions ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Kanagawa Prefecture ","title":"Amakaze K≈çichi"},{"id":"54254487","text":"In the 2006‚Äì07 season of competitive football (soccer) in Cape Verde2006 Cape Verdean football season at RSSSF It was the first season that the national cup competition took place, its first winner was Acad√©mica da Praia. ==Diary of the season== *September 25 - CS Mar√≠timo do Porto Novo celebrated its 25th anniversary *The Cape Verdean Football Federation celebrated its 25th anniversary *November: Paulense celebrated its 25th anniversary *Sport Sal Rei Club won their 6th title for Boa Vista *SC Morabeza won their 3rd title for Brava *Vulc√¢nicos FC won their 6th title for Fogo *Acad√©mica da Calheta won their 1st title for Maio *Acad√©mico do Aeroporto won their 8th title for Sal *Scorpion Vermelho won their 1st title for Santiago North *Sporting Clube da Praia won their 3rd title for Santiago South *Rosariense won their 2nd title Santo Ant√£o North *Sporting Clube do Porto Novo won their 2nd title for Santo Ant√£o South *FC Ultramarina won their 7th title for S√£o Nicolau *Acad√©mica do Mindelo won their 10th and recent title for S√£o Vicente *May 12: **2007 Cape Verdean Football Championships began **Acad√©mico do Aeroporto defeated Sporting Porto Novo 8-0 and made it the highest scoring match for the season *May 30: The match between Acad√©mica Praia and Vulc√¢nicos was rescheduled, Acad√©mica Praia won 1-0 *May 31: The match between Morabeza and Sal Rei was rescheduled, Sal Rei won 3-1 *June 9: Acad√©mica do Mindelo defeated Sal Rei 6-0 and made it the season's second highest scoring match *June 24: Regular season ends *June 30: Knockout stage begins *July 14: Championship finals begins *July 21 - Sporting Clube da Praia claimed their 6th national championship title *August 25, - the 2007 Cape Verdean Cup begins *August 30 - Group stage of the national cup begins *September 1 - Acad√©mica da Praia won their only national cup title ==Final standings== Cape Verdean Football Championships Acad√©mica do Mindelo and Acad√©mico do Aeroporto were first in each group along with two Praia based teams Sporting and Acad√©mica, second of each group.

Due to the Amazon Cells need for human-based proteins to maintain or enhance their strength, an Amazon is usually driven by instinct to hunt humans or cannibalize the other Amazons in extreme cases. Experiment Amazons Disparagingly referred by the Exterminations are , these 4,000 Amazons are artificial humanoids created by the Nozama Pharmacy and were released into the city two years prior to the events of the series secretly by Takaaki Tenjo to see their full potential in a chaotic environment. The Experiment Amazons are outfitted with Amazons Registers to supply them with a limited supply of drug-based depressant to quell the Amazon Cells, allowing them to blend into human society and feed like regular humans. However, once the serum runs out, an Amazon would usually be consumed by its instinct to devour humans. As the Amazons Register double as tracking devices, an transformed Amazon is beyond the serum's potency and would need to be killed. But Experiment Amazons that suffered traumatic experience are able to subvert their man-eating instincts with most are incapable of directly hurting humans unprovoked. While Haruka attempted to lead the remaining thousand to a new place to exist in peace following Operation Tlaloc, the Experiment Amazons eventually died out due to Jin hunting them down despite their attempt to fight back by creating the New-Type Amazons to fight for them. *: *: *: An Amazon who assumed the identity of , residing in an apartment complex where she feed on human servicemen that she tricked into her room.

Women constituted roughly 75% of the workforce there. While women were overwhelmingly under-represented in high- level work, such as cryptanalysis, they were employed in large numbers in important auxiliary work, such as: operating cryptographic machinery and communications machinery; translating of Axis documents; traffic analysis; clerical duties, and many more besides. == Background == Bletchley Park was the central site for British cryptanalysis during World War II. It housed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers ‚Äì most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. According to Sir Harry Hinsley, the \\"Ultra\\" intelligence produced at Bletchley Park shortened the war by approximately two years. Bletchley Park is famous for the impact it had on the war and for the work performed there by scholars such as Alan Turing and Dilly Knox. This work, though secret until 1974, had a significant impact on the history of science and technology ‚Äì in particular, the history of technology. In the past century, archivists and historians have increasingly emphasized the role of the women who worked in Bletchley Park. == Recruitment of women == Women dutifully working in Bletchley Park. In 1937, when the tensions in Europe and Asia were becoming apparent, the Chief of MI6, Admiral Hugh Sinclair, ordered GC&CS; to begin preparing for a war-footing and to expand its staff numbers. These were to be \\"men of the professor type\\", primarily drawn from Oxford and, in particular, Cambridge universities. However, as the cryptanalytic work became increasingly mechanized, many more staff were needed. Women were first brought into Bletchley Park after being approached at university or because of trusted family connections; debutantes especially were prized, as they were considered the most trustworthy due to their upper class backgrounds. These \\"debs\\" performed mostly administrative and clerical work. However, the personnel needs of Bletchley Park continued to grow. The heads of Bletchley Park next looked for women who were linguists, mathematicians, and even crossword experts. In 1942 the Daily Telegraph hosted a competition where a cryptic crossword was to be solved within 12 minutes. Winners were approached by the military and some were recruited to work at Bletchley Park, as these individuals were thought to have strong lateral thinking skills, important for codebreaking. The majority of these women came from middle-class backgrounds and some held degrees in mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into STEM programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. By the end of 1944 in excess of 2,500 women were employed by GC&CS; from the Women's Royal Naval Service (whose members were called \\"Wrens\\"); over 1,500 women were assigned from the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (\\"WAAFs\\") and approximately 400 came from the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Six out of ten women working in Bletchley Park were serving in the British Armed Forces. Many of those women were more interested in working on planes and ships, and never expected to work in a place such as Bletchley Park. Women held numerous roles at Bletchley Park, ranging from administrators, index card compilers and dispatch riders, to a very few as code-breaking specialists. Initially many of the men in charge were skeptical that women would be able to operate the Bombe machines and the Colossus computers; in one section which employed women, including college graduates, the male section head opined that ‚Äúwomen wouldn‚Äôt like to do any intellectual work‚Äù. Gordon Preston persuaded Max Newman (who thought that the women would not care for the \\"intellectual effort\\") to authorise talks to the Wrens to explain their work mathematically, and the talks were very popular. Women in Bletchley Park soon proved themselves to be up to the task, as they performed good work in any position they held at Bletchley Park. Though the initial focus of recruitment, particularly during the latter years of the inter-war period, focused primarily on male academics, there soon emerged an eclectic staff of \\"Boffins and Debs\\", which caused GC&CS; to be whimsically dubbed the \\"Golf, Cheese and Chess Society\\". At the outbreak of the war Dilly Knox was the GC&CS;'s chief cryptanalyst and, as such, took a leading role in the work on the various Enigma networks. His team, which he staffed with women (\\"Dilly's girls\\"), included Margaret Rock and Mavis Lever, sometimes termed \\"Dilly's Fillies\\". During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, Winston Churchill reportedly remarked to head of GC&CS; Alastair Denniston: \\"I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.\\" Women in World War II worked in many places that previously had been largely confined to men, such as industry and the military. Bletchley Park was unusual because the women there worked on demanding intellectual labour. One of the few directly comparable scenarios during the conflict was that American women recruited to do artillery ballistics calculations and program computers. These women \\"computers\\" used a differential analyzer in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering to speed up their calculations, though the machine required a mechanic to be totally accurate and the women often rechecked the calculations by hand.Gumbrecht, Jamie (8 February 2011). \\"Rediscovering WWII's female 'computers'\\". CNN. Archived from the original on 10 May 2012. == Selected women == This section tells the stories of a few selected women who worked in Bletchley Park. Mavis Batey Mavis Lilian Lever was born on 5 May 1921Mavis Batey: from codebreaker to campaigner for historic parks and gardens, parksandgardens.org; accessed 16 May 2014. in Dulwich to her seamstress mother and postal worker father. She was brought up in Norbury and went to Coloma Convent Girls' School in Croydon. She was studying German at University College, London at the outbreak of World War II, concentrating on the German romantics in particular. Initially employed to check the personal columns of The Times for coded spy messages,Barwick, Sandra. A cracking time at Bletchley The Daily Telegraph, 16 January 1999 in 1940 she was recruited to work as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park. She worked as an assistant to Dilly Knox, and was closely involved in the decryption effort before the Battle of Matapan. According to The Daily Telegraph, she became so familiar with the styles of individual enemy operators that she could determine that two of them had a girlfriend called Rosa and this insight allowed her to develop a successful technique. In December 1941 she broke a message between Belgrade and Berlin that enabled Dilly Knox's team to work out the wiring of the Abwehr Enigma, an Enigma machine previously thought to be unbreakable. While at Bletchley Park she met Keith Batey, a mathematician and fellow codebreaker whom she married in 1942. Jane Fawcett Jane Hughes was assigned to Hut 6, a \\"Decoding Room\\" of women only. The conditions were poor‚Äîdimly lit, poorly heated, and poorly ventilated‚Äîand the women worked long hours under extreme pressure. In Hut 6, Jane would receive the daily Enigma keys and type them into their own Typex machines. They would then determine if the messages were recognizable German. On 25 May 1941, Hughes and several other women were briefed on the search for the German battleship Bismarck. Shortly thereafter, she decoded a message referring to the Bismarck that detailed its current position and destination in France. The Bismarck was subsequently attacked by the Royal Navy and sunk on 27 May. This was the first significant victory by the codebreakers, demonstrating the utility of the project. Her work did not come to light until decades later, during the 1990s, as it had been classified under Britain's Official Secrets Act of 1939. Compared with the publicly acknowledged heroics of the navy, Fawcett said \\"we felt slightly ashamed of having only done Bletchley, like also-rans. So when everything we had done, which we knew had been very hard work and incredibly demanding, suddenly showed its head and we were being asked to talk about it, it felt quite overwhelming. I'd never told a soul, not even my husband. My grandchildren were very surprised.\\" Jean Valentine Jean Valentine (born 1924, Scotland) was an operator of the bombe decryption device in Hut 11 at Bletchley Park in England, designed by Alan Turing and others during World War II. She was a member of the \\"Wrens\\" (Women's Royal Naval Service, WRNS). During this time, she lived in Steeple Claydon in Buckinghamshire. She started working on 15 shillings (75 pence) a week. Along with her co-workers, she remained quiet about her war work until the mid-1970s. More recently, Jean Valentine has been involved with the reconstruction of the bombe at Bletchley Park Museum,What to see at Bletchley Park: Bombe Rebuild Project, Bletchley Park, UK. completed in 2006. In 2006, she said: \\"Unless people come pouring through the doors, a vital piece of history is lost. The more we can educate them, the better.\\" She demonstrates the reconstructed bombe at the Bletchley Park Museum.Jean Valentine explains the bombe, CastTV. and also leads tours there.BCSWomen trip to Bletchley Park, BCSWomen, UK, 8 May 2008.\\"The geese that laid the golden egg ‚Äî but never cackled\\" ‚Äî Winston Churchill, Skirts and Ladders, 26 July 2009.Feature: Decoding Bletchley Park's history, Gizmag Emerging Technology Magazine. She participated in a major reunion at Bletchley Park in 2009.'Geese' cackle over Enigma: British code breakers reunite to celebrate secret work that helped Allies defeat Nazis, The Star, Toronto, Canada, 25 March 2009. On 24 June 2012, Jean Valentine spoke on her wartime experiences at Bletchley Park and elsewhere as part of a Turing's Worlds event to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, organized by the Department for Continuing Education's Rewley House at Oxford University in cooperation with the British Society for the History of Mathematics (BSHM). Joan Clarke Joan Elisabeth Lowther Murray (n√©e Clarke; 24 June 1917 ‚Äì 4 September 1996) was a cryptanalyst and numismatist. Though she did not personally seek the spotlight, her important role in the Enigma project that decrypted Nazi Germany's secret communications earned her awards and citations, such as appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), in 1946. ==Legacy and commemorations== There have been many efforts to commemorate the contribution of women in Bletchley Park; in particular, there has been a proliferation of online articles devoted to examining the role of women in Bletchley Park during the past 5 years. Due to the secrecy of Bletchley Park and the United Kingdom's Thirty-year rule, it wasn't until the 1974 publishing of The Ultra Secret by former RAF officer F. W. Winterbotham (who supervised the distribution of Ultra intelligence) that the wartime role of Bletchley Park began to be discussed, and only in 2009 did the British government award honors to its personnel. There have been recent efforts to get women who worked in Bletchley Park to meet up some 70 years after they last saw each other, as the women tended not to stay in touch with their coworkers after the war (due to the secret atmosphere back then). Women often didn't even know the names of the machines they had worked on until they read books about Bletchley Park released decades after WWII; families and friends usually had no idea what these women worked on during WWII. Interviews of women who worked at Bletchley Park have them saying they enjoyed their time there due to doing interesting work and being around interesting people, as well as a sense that they were doing important work (although most never knew just how important their work ended up being, which reportedly shortened WWII by up to two years and saved millions of lives). Most women gave up their careers after they left Bletchley Park and got married; however, many of the full fledged female codebreakers (such as Joan Clarke) went on to have fruitful careers in cryptanalysis (bolstered by the good work they had done in Bletchley Park). Memorials Bletchley Park has a Roll of Honour, which lists everyone in Britain believed to have worked on signals intelligence during WWII, at Bletchley Park and other places; it was compiled from official sources, veterans, friends and families. No complete list of those who worked at Bletchley Park and its outstations was ever produced, so new information is constantly being added to the list. As of July 2017, there are almost 8,000 women listed in the Roll of Honour.  Popular culture  * The Imitation Game is a film focusing on Alan Turing's life in Bletchley Park; one topic is his relationship with Joan Clarke, one of the few women who worked as a full fledged codebreaker in Bletchley Park. However, there is some criticism of the movie for portraying codebreaking as a men's game and not talking more about the role of women in codebreaking. * The Imitation Game, the television play, focusing on the female protagonist's successes and frustrations while working in Bletchley Park. * The 2012 ITV programme, The Bletchley Circle, is a set of murder mysteries set in 1952 and 1953. The protagonists are four female former Bletchley codebreakers, who use their skills to solve crimes. The pilot episode's opening scene was filmed on-site, and the set was asked to remain there for its close adaptation of historiography. * Enigma is a 2001 fictional film about the Enigma codebreakers in Bletchley Park where a love affair between coworkers is a main topic. * The film Hut 33 focuses on day-to-day life in Bletchley Park, and so, discusses women's daily lives in Bletchley Park. *The Agent Carter season 2 episode \\"Smoke & Mirrors\\" reveals that Agent Peggy Carter worked at Bletchley Park early in the war before joining the Strategic Scientific Reserve. == See also == * List of women in Bletchley Park * List of people associated with Bletchley Park * United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory, where some women recruited from WAVES worked as codebreakers (one notable such woman being Agnes Meyer Driscoll) == References  Further reading ==  Books  * (=pb) * Smith, Michael (2015).

It is a complex opus, with a central figure (the Moravagine character) like a dark persona of the author which he gets rid of through writing. Its genesis took a decade (with Cendrars hinting at it as early as 1917) and Cendrars never stopped working on it. In 1956, the author somewhat rewrote the text, added a postface and a section titled \\"Pro domo: How I wrote Moravagine\\". In its ultimate revision, Cendrars says the book is definitely incomplete, as it was meant to be a preface to a \\"complete works of Moravagine\\" that are not there. ==Synopsis== The narrator, Raymond la Science, presented as a Blaise Cendrars' acquaintance (who himself appears in the novel), writes how, being a physician, he comes across Moravagine, a killer madman detained in an asylum. Moravagine is the last, degenerate heir to a long line of Eastern Europe noblemen. Fascinated by this man, the physician helps him escape then shares his picaresque travel around the world, bumping from Russian terrorists to American natives, in a trail of crimes. Finally they return to Europe just in time for World War I, when \\"the whole world was doing a Moravagine.\\" ==Style, Death and Woman== While characters live a wild adventure, the style in contrast is straight and controlled (as opposed to, for instance, Journey to the End of the Night).

The game is set in 2084 in a future where road accidents have been eliminated by technology, and the world is relatively bloodless; however, people now entertain themselves by drivers using 20th century automobiles in violent, gladiatorial contests. == Gameplay == Loading screen Up to two players battle each other or the computer with vehicles that use an assortment of armor, weapons, and other components including missiles, mines, machine guns, lasers, oil, and smoke. Players can fight their cars on a racetrack, in an arena (the Autodrome), or on the streets of Slug City. On the racetrack, players navigate through a narrow circuit, competing primarily against rough terrain and a clock. The Autodrome is a bare arena where two cars can focus on battling each other. Slug City is a townscape where cars could battle each other on narrow streets. A player can play against the computer or a second player in either the racetrack or Autodrome; however, players can only play each other in Slug City. Except for when racing on the racetrack, the primary goal of the game is to find your opponent and destroy their car. Players can take advantage of gas stations and service garages to obtain fuel or repairs, but using either makes a player vulnerable to attack from their opponent. A notable gameplay element at the time of the game's release in 1984 was that cars would realistically \\"drift\\" when they tried to turn at a high rate of speed. When playing a game, players are presented a screen that shows the area in which they are driving their car, a map of the entire venue, the current speed and fuel of their car, any damage it receives, and information about available weapons. When there are two players, each player has their own playing screen on the computer monitor. The game is played using twelve keys on a keyboard to control each car and its weapons. The game has eight car configurations from which players could choose. Battlecars also comes with a program, Designer, which allows players to customize the vehicles they want to use in battle. Gameplay screenshot ==Development== Battlecars was developed for the ZX Spectrum by SLUG (a Harlow co-operative of ex-programmers from Red Shift) using BASIC.\\"From Tin Soldiers to Computer Games\\"; CRASH issue 9, October 1984; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition Julian Gollop notably developed the Designer program which allows players to edit the cars in the game. Games Workshop released Battlecars as a computer game for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. The game came with a sixteen-page instruction manual. Summit Software re-released the game in 1987. ==Reception== Roger Kean previewed Battlecars in Crash #9 (October 1984), calling it \\"rather more straightforward than one would expect from a company so immersed in the occult\\", and described the handling of the game's high speed vehicles \\"quite alarmingly realistic\\". Kevin Westbury reviewed Battlecars for White Dwarf #60, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \\"All in all, Battlecars is fast, furious and great fun, and manages to combine simple operations with quite complex play, where only the best drivers and the surest shots will survive.\\" Representative of the game's positive reception, Bob Wade reviewed Battlecars for Personal Computer Games, calling the game \\"a bleak view of an automative future but terrific to play\\". Representative of the game's negative reception, Computer and Video Games was critical of Battlecars, saying \\"It's one thing to have a good idea for a game, but another one to actually write the program.\\" Your Sinclair elaborated on this criticism a few years later by noting \\"the horrid thing kept crashing on me.\\" ==References==  Other references  Super Play #12 (October 1993) featured a preview of Battlecars. ==External links== * Category:1984 video games Category:Games Workshop games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer hotseat games Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games based on miniatures games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:ZX Spectrum-only games ","title":"Battlecars (video game)"},{"id":"54254762","text":"The Greenfield Dolomite is a geologic formation in Ohio.

He is the older brother of Brett Butler and the son of Aaron's president Ken Butler. Butler III has driven in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, Camping World Truck Series, ARCA Racing Series, and the Pro Cup Series. == Racing career ==  Pro Cup Series  Butler's interest in racing started when his father took younger brother Brett and Ken to a go-kart race when Ken was eighteen. He took classes at the Richard Petty Driving Experience and Buddy Baker's Speed Tech. Five years later, Butler ran his first season in the Pro Cup Series, recording a best finish of twelfth at Bristol Motor Speedway and finishing seventeenth in points. He ran the following season, 2006, and recorded his first top ten and top five. He also failed to qualify for two races that season. He ran a race at South Boston Speedway in 2007 while focusing on the ARCA Racing Series and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.  ARCA Racing Series  Butler ran a limited schedule in the 2007 ARCA Re/Max Series with Eddie Sharp Racing as part of its driver development program. He scored his first career victory in only his fourth start, holding off Ken Schrader at Toledo Speedway. However, a damper was put on Bulter's win as he bumped Michael McDowell out of the way in what some, including Schrader, called an unfair move. Continuing to run as part of ESR and Michael Waltrip Racing's development program, he ran along teammates Justin Lofton and Scott Speed. Butler was not victorious at all that year, the only one of three cars on the team to do so. Despite that, he moved up to the NASCAR Nationwide Series for 2009. That year, Butler ran a limited schedule for Andy Belmont but struggled. Butler with R3 Motorsports at the Milwaukee Mile in 2009.  NASCAR  Balancing a part-time ARCA Racing Series schedule in 2007, Butler made two starts for Darrell Waltrip Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series, but failed to finish either of them. Two years later, Butler signed with R3 Motorsports to run just about half the schedule in the Nationwide Series and named Aaron's as sponsor. He ran well at intermediate tracks such as Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kentucky Speedway, recording top twenty results on those tracks, but struggled at short tracks like Richmond International Raceway, Dover International Speedway, Indianapolis Raceway Park and Iowa Speedway. Out of a full-time ride in 2010, Butler ran one race for Rick Ware Racing in the Truck Series. He did not return to NASCAR until 2013, when SR¬≤ Motorsports brought Butler back for an eight-race schedule, along with his brother Brett Butler for a few races. Out of the eight races, Butler III failed to finish five but posted top-thirty finishes in all the races he finished. == Personal life == Butler had his first child, Piper Shay, in 2009 with his wife Jamie. ==Motorsports career results== NASCAR (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Abstemius tells how doves manage to end a conflict between warring hawks, only to have the raptors turn on them instead. His moral is to let well alone so that the vulnerable can live at peace. In La Fontaine‚Äôs version, the protagonists are changed to vultures and pigeons (Les vautours et les pigeons) and there are many Classical references not found in the original.Elizur Wright‚Äôs English version It is Mars who has thrown ‚Äúall the air in ferment‚Äù (line 1); the birds concerned are not the doves harnessed by Venus to her chariot (lines 7-8) but vultures, of which so many are killed that ‚ÄúPrometheus on his rock began to hope at last to see the ending of his torture‚Äù (lines 15-16). After the pigeons intervene to their own eventual destruction, La Fontaine concludes that it is better to keep the belligerent at war in order to stay safe. There were two later literary versions in England, each closer to adaptations than faithful translations. In the Select Fables of Charles Denis (London 1754) it is titled ‚ÄúThe Vulturs and the Pidgeons‚Äù.pp.390-93 In Brooke Boothby‚Äôs imitation in Fables & Satires (Edinburgh 1809) the outcome of the peacemaking is compared to the Partition of Poland as the result of concord between former war rivals.Vol.2, pp.69-70 A Latin text titled Accipitres et columbae, but different from that of Abstemius, appeared in successive editions of Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs‚Äô Latin Reader, claiming to be the work of Aesop.

There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. {   center; font-size:smaller;\\" - style=\\"background-color: #efefef;\\" ! width=\\"2%\\" Stage ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Winner ! width=\\"12.25%\\" General classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Points classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Mountains classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Young rider classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Sprints classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Teams classification - scope=row P  Andrea Palini FFEB64;\\" Andrea Palini style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" Not awarded 9CE97B;\\" Not awarded FF8C00;\\" rowspan=2 Ga≈°per Katra≈°nik style=\\"background:lightblue; Not awarded style=\\"background:salmon;\\" rowspan=5 Eduard-Michael Grosu FFCD5F;\\" - scope=row 1  Edwin √Åvila FFEB64;\\" Edwin √Åvila style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" Edwin √Åvila 9CE97B;\\" rowspan=4 Moritz Fu√ünegger style=\\"background:lightblue; Edwin √Åvila FFCD5F;\\" - scope=row 2  Egan Bernal FFEB64;\\" rowspan=3 Egan Bernal style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" rowspan=3 Egan Bernal FF8C00;\\" rowspan=3 Egan Bernal style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" rowspan=2 Germ√°n Tivani FFCD5F;\\" rowspan=3 - scope=row 3  Egan Bernal - scope=row 4  Eduard-Michael Grosu style=\\"background:lightblue; Damian L√ºscher - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Final !FFDB00;\\" Egan Bernal !style=\\"background:white;\\" Egan Bernal !46E800;\\" Moritz Fu√ünegger !FF8C00;\\" Egan Bernal !style=\\"background:dodgerblue;\\" Damian L√ºscher !style=\\"background:red;\\" Eduard-Michael Grosu !FFB927;\\" } == Notes References External links == * Sibiu Cycling Tour Category:2017 in Romanian sport Category:UCI Europe Tour races Category:Cycle races in Romania ","title":"2017 Sibiu Cycling Tour"},{"id":"54254884","text":"The United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy (ACPD), created in 1948, is tasked by Congress with \\"appraising U.S. Government activities intended to understand, inform, and influence foreign publics and to increase the understanding of, and support for, these same activities.\\" The commission is supported by the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, and reports to the President, Secretary of State, and Congress. Its current charter authorizes the Commission through fiscal year 2020.United States Department of State The commission conducts independent research and hosts symposia and panels to discuss public diplomacy while bringing together practitioners throughout the U.S. government and outside experts to provide honest assessments of and policy recommendations for improving U.S. public diplomacy. Priority areas of focus for the commission include: improving research and evaluation to bolster the impact of PD programs; integrating strategic planning with program design; strengthening public diplomacy professionals' development and training; and preparing public diplomats for the changing technological landscape of the 21st century. ==Members and leaders== The commission is a non-partisan body and members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Current members include Sim Farar, William J. Hybl, and Anne Terman Wedner. Recent former members include Ambassador Lyndon Lowell Olson, Jr., Ambassador Penne Korth Peacock, and Ambassador Georgette Paulsin Mosbacher, . The commission's Executive Director oversees general operations and works closely with U.S. government officials, NGOs, think tanks, businesses, academia, and other public diplomacy professionals to produce constructive ideas and recommendations for how the U.S. government engages in public diplomacy.

He later became a teacher and licensed preacher there, but left the Free Church in 1908 over delays to his ordination and he later established an independent Seventh-day Baptist church and school in the Mzimba district. Domingo was one of three Africans sponsored by Joseph Booth who created independent churches in Nyasaland in the early 20th century, the others being John Chilembwe and Elliot Kamwana. Domingo did not favour armed revolt, as Chilembwe did, nor was he a charismatic preacher seeking rapid social change like Kamwana. He was a moderate social reformer who strongly criticised the inequalities of colonial rule, and a teacher who believed that Africans should run their own churches free of external supervision and use these churches to promote a high standard of education to create a cultured African elite, which would undertake its own social and political advancement. He failed because of inadequate resources in the poverty-stricken north of Nyasaland and through government suspicion of his motives, but he remains one of the pioneers of Malawi‚Äôs independence. ==Early life and education== Charles Vincente Domingo was a Kunda born around 1875 in the lower Shire River valley in Mozambique. As a young child, he lived in Quelimane with his father, who was employed there as a cook by the African Lakes Company. He was found in Quelimane in 1881, apparently after his father had died, by the South African Presbyterian evangelist, William Koyi, who was attached to the Livingstonia mission and was returning there from South Africa. Koyi took the boy to the mission and acted as guardian until his death in 1884.H. W. Langworthy (1985).

Ngoni, Xhosa and Scot, Kachere Books Zomba, pp. 36-7 Domingo then became a household servant of Dr Robert Laws at Livingstonia, studying in its school and being baptised into the Free Church of Scotland. Through Laws‚Äô efforts, Domingo secured the best education then available in Central Africa, including travelling with Laws to the Lovedale Missionary Institute in South Africa between 1891 and 1894. On his return to Livingstonia, he studied to become a teacher, after which he became the first African teaching assistant in the Livingstonia mission school in 1897. This was followed by further theological studies at the Overtoun Institute in Livingstonia from 1900 to 1902, and he was licensed as a preacher in 1903, serving as preacher and schoolmaster for the next six years.H.

Harvard University Press pp. 69-70 ==Break with the Free Church== In 1907, after serving five years‚Äô probation for ordination as a minister, which he considered was long overdue, Domingo was sent to Loudon mission to prepare for ordination under the supervision of Donald Fraser. Domingo had already demonstrated a degree of independence,G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African.

Joseph Booth, Charles Domingo, and the Seventh Day Baptists in Northern Nyasaland,1910-12, The Journal of African History, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1971), p. 474 After a public dispute with Fraser, he left his post in November 1908, travelled to the south of Nyasaland and received baptism from John Chilembwe, effectively ending any connection with what was now the United Free Church of Scotland.H. W. Langworthy (1985). Charles Domingo Seventh Day Baptists and Independency, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 97-8 In early 1909, encouraged by Chilembwe, Domingo went to preach in the British Concession of Chinde in Mozambique, a transhipment port for Nyasaland.A. Hetherwick, (1917) Nyasaland To-day and To-morrow, Journal of the Royal African Society, Vol. 17, No. 65, p. 12. He stayed for about a year, leaving because he had become ill, because the greater financial support he expected, either from Chilembwe‚Äôs Providence Industrial Mission or its American backers, failed to materialised, and also because the Portuguese authorities objected to his activities there.H. W. Langworthy (1985). Charles Domingo Seventh Day Baptists and Independency, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 98-100 ==Search for an independent church == Following his meeting with Chilembwe and, in search for a new religious direction, Domingo corresponded with Charles Taze Russell and, after reading Russell's published writings while in Mozambique, joined the Watch Tower Society in 1909. He established contact with Joseph Booth in South Africa and also corresponded with Elliot Kamwana before the latter was deported from Nyasaland in 1909. On his return to Nyasaland in 1910, Domingo joined the independent Seventh-day Baptist church that Booth‚Äôs disciples had formed, and which Booth funded, in the north of the protectorate.Kenneth P. Lohrentz, (1971). Joseph Booth, Charles Domingo, and the Seventh Day Baptists in Northern Nyasaland, 1910-12, The Journal of African History, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1971), p. 468 There was no clear split between this movement and the Watch Tower Society until the visit of an American representative of the society in late 1910, who was strongly opposed to the doctrine of Sabbatarianism that Booth had promoted. Most of congregations founded by Kamwana supported Watch Tower following his brief and illegal return by from his deportation in October 1910, but most of those begun by others of Booth‚Äôs disciples rejected Watch Tower control. By 1911, the division between the two groups was total.H. W. Langworthy (1985). Charles Domingo Seventh Day Baptists and Independency, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 101-3 Despite his earlier membership of the Watch Tower movement, Domingo did not express the sort of millennial expectations entertained by Elliot Kamwana, who predicted the start of the Millennium and the ending of colonial rule in 1914.T. J. Thompson (2015). Prester John, John Chilembwe and the European Fear of Ethiopianism, the Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 68, No. 2, p. 24 From 1910 onward, Domingo made very strong criticisms of European missions, government and companies in his letters, seeing them as the three bodies that combined to oppress Africans.G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African. John Chilembwe and the Origins, Setting and Significance of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915. Edinburgh University Press, pp. 240-1 As these letters did not come to the notice of the colonial authorities, he was not regarded as subversive at that time. The authorities regarded the independent Seventh-day Baptist churches with disfavour but, as they did not voice opposition to the government, they were not considered a threat.Kenneth P. Lohrentz, (1971). Joseph Booth, Charles Domingo, and the Seventh Day Baptists in Northern Nyasaland,1910-12, The Journal of African History, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1971), pp. 475-8 Between 1911 and 1915, Domingo was the pastor of a small Seventh-day Baptist congregation that grew only slowly in size as, in contrast to Kamwana, he rejected the mass conversion of converts uninstructed in church beliefs. He established a number of village schools and was himself the teacher of a small number of pupils that he aimed to teach to a high standard, rather than just one of basic literacy, but his educational activities were hampered by local poverty and the shortage of external funding.H. W. Langworthy (1985). Charles Domingo Seventh Day Baptists and Independency, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 103-5Kenneth P. Lohrentz, (1971). Joseph Booth, Charles Domingo, and the Seventh Day Baptists in Northern Nyasaland, 1910-12, The Journal of African History, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1971), pp. 468-70 Initially, support from the American Seventh-day Baptist movement was channelled through Joseph Booth in South Africa, but 1911 and 1912 most of the Nyasaland pastors sought funding directly from America rather than through him, and requested the appointment of a resident missionary. Their intervention led to the American organisation ending its association with Booth and making further financial support conditional on acceptance of a white American missionary with supervisory power over African pastors. Domingo was against this loss of independence, and wished to run his congregation with limited outside financial support, mainly that needed to support his educational scheme, but no supervision. No American missionary was appointed until 1914 and he was ordered to leave the area after a month, so American support for Domingo and other African pastors was minimal.H. W. Langworthy (1985). Charles Domingo Seventh Day Baptists and Independency, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 112-3, 116-17 ==After the Chilembwe uprising== Domingo had no known connection with the Chilembwe uprising but, in its aftermath, he came under suspicion and his correspondence was intercepted. In January 1916, after replying favourably to a letter from Booth advocating African political representation, he was required to leave Nyasaland and was sent to Chinde as a clerk but was transferred to Zomba in 1917.Rotberg, R I (1965).

He then returned to preaching and teaching in the Seventh-day Baptist church until resuming work for the government in 1934. Nothing further is known of his history, except that he occasionally communicated with the Seventh-day Baptists in America until his death some time in the late 1950s.H. W. Langworthy (1985).

Ilva was established in 1905 in Genoa and existed through the decline of European steel manufacturing during the 1970s and 1980s until its final privatization in 1995. Ilva main assets, including giant Taranto steelworks, Europe's largest, were acquired by Gruppo Riva. In 2012 Taranto steel plant was at the centre of an environmental scandal that led to the arrest and conviction of some Riva family members and the transfer of the steelworks to ArcelorMittal. ==History== Early history (1905-1934) The company was founded in Genoa on 1 February 1905, its namesake being the Latin name for Elba island, seat of plentiful iron ore deposits that fueled the first blast furnaces built in Italy in the late 19th century. Ilva was born from the merger of the steel activities of Siderurgica di Savona group, of Acciaierie di Terni and of its subsidiary Ligure Metallurgica. The initial share capital of the limited company was 12 million Italian lire, that was increased to 20 million lire when Elba group joined shortly after. The new company, controlled by Genoese financers, was set up with the political and financial backing of the Italian state, in order to build the Bagnoli steel plant, as part of the 1904 law for the development of Naples, prepared by economist and later prime minister Francesco Saverio Nitti. During the First world war Ilva benefited from big state contracts, but the end of the war effort and the postwar recession, combined with the effects of the red scare of 1920-21, brought it close to bankruptcy and in 1922 Banca Commerciale Italiana assumed control of the company. From IRI to italsider (1934-1995) Bagnoli steelworks before its closure in 1992. Ilva continued to struggle during the 1920s, until the 1929 crash dealt a fatal blow to the company, that in 1934 was eventually acquired by IRI, the public holding company established in 1933 by the Fascist regime to rescue, restructure and finance banks and private companies that went bankrupt during the Great Depression. Ilva thus became part of Finsider, IRI's holding specializing in steel production (that controlled also Acciaierie di Cornigliano S.p.A. steelworks, known as SAIC, and many other smaller steel companies, among which Terni Acciai Speciali S.p.A. and Dalmine S.p.A.). After the Second world war, IRI president Oscar Sinigaglia used Marshall Plan funds to rebuild and modernize SAIC steelworks in Cornigliano and merged them with Ilva in 1961, creating a new company called Italsider. The new company expanded rapidly in the 1960s. In 1965 giant Taranto integrated iron and steel complex became operational, occupying 5,000 workers and adding 10.5 million tons of capacity to Italsider. However, by the early 1970s steel production in the EEC was suffering from overcapacity and foreign competition. Italsider made no exception, taking very heavy losses during steel crisis that hit all the Western economies in the late 1970s and especially in the 1980s. In 1984 Italsider sold SAIC to COGEA, a consortium of private steel companies dominated by Falck Group, that in turn resold it to Gruppo Riva in 1988. In 1992 Italsider, in a last attempt to reduce overcapacity and losses, closed Bagnoli steelworks in Naples  Gruppo Riva ownership and environmental scandal at Taranto (1995-2012)  Taranto steelworks in 2007. In 1995 the Italian state decided to get rid of loss-making Ilva and its subsidiaries. Gruppo Riva purchased the Taranto steel plant, the German-based multinational ThyssenKrupp took over Acciai Speciali Terni S.p.A. (AST); Dalmine S.p.A. (steel pipes and tubes) was sold to Tenaris; and other plants were ceded to Gruppo Lucchini. Thus, Gruppo Riva came to own Taranto steelworks in southern Italy, Europe's largest steel plant. During a 2012 inquiry, Taranto steel plant has been found to produce elevated emissions of dioxin, correlated to abnormally high cancer incidence in the area, bringing to the seizure of the plant by the Italian state. According to the European Pollutant Emission Register, emissions of dioxin by Taranto steel plant accounted for 30.6 per cent of all emissions in Italy in 2002, and much more according to an inquiry by PeaceLink NGO. (2012-2019) - From the commissioners to ArcelorMittal In 2012, an investigation for environmental crimes and pollution led the Taranto prosecutor to order the seizure without the right to use the plants in the furnace area. To safeguard the establishment and employment, the Italian government has initiated the company commissioner procedure and launched an international tender for a assignment of the same. Since January 2015, the company has been under extraordinary administration pursuant to the Marzano Law. By March 2017, ArcelorMittal was leading a consortium bidding for Ilva. The ArcelorMittal consortium was selected as the preferred bidder over a different consortium led by JSW Steel after it was able to pledge a production increase and guarantee employment levels. The final decision was waiting on Italy‚Äôs ministry of economic development. On 5 June 2017, ArcelorMittal won approval to purchase Ilva for ‚Ç¨1.8 billion. The buyers were the AM Investco consortium, which beyond ArcelorMittal included Marcegaglia and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo. In its bid, AM Investco also pledged to make investments into Ilva of ‚Ç¨2.4 billion until 2023. ILVA is part of ArcelorMittal Group as of 1 November 2018. On 5 November 2019 ArcelorMittal announced its intention to withdraw from the transfer agreement, returning it to Ilva, in extraordinary administration, within 30 days. Procedures to shut down the plant were started, then interrupted under legal and political pressure.  2020 - The return to the commissioners management In 2020, ILVA returns to the commissioners management, under the protection of the penal shield, implementing all the modernization procedures and environmental sustainability of the Taranto plant. ==See also== *Steel industry in Italy *List of steel producers *List of countries by steel production *List of tallest structures in Italy ==ReferencesExternal links== *www.gruppoilva.com ArcelorMittal Category:Steel companies of Italy ","title":"Ilva (company)"},{"id":"54255003","text":"Potentilla canadensis, the dwarf cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil (genus Potentilla) native to North America.https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=POCA17 The Iroquois take a pounded infusion of the roots as an antidiarrheal.

In 2010, young Elias was played by Niilo Heinonen, but the character later returned to the series grown up and was replaced by Petteri Paavola. Elias is gay and the character has become popular with his on-off boyfriend Lari, creating a phenomenon known as \\"Larias\\". Their story has been translated into many languages and the couple have many fans around the world. Elias leaves the series in spring 2015, but comes back in autumn in the same year. Elias is run over by Marianna and dies of injuries in the episode aired on November 7, 2016. In the episode aired on March 17, 2017, Elias appears in Marianna's hallucinations and in Lari's dream. ==Childhood== Elias is born to Sebastian Vuorela and Ritva \\"Cindy\\" Rintala, but Cindy cannot raise the boy alone as Sebastian is in jail. Cindy decides that Elias be adopted, and therefore Meri Vikstedt becomes his guardian. Years later Sebastian bumps into his son when he is doing janitor work and defends Elias against bully boys. Soon Sebastian wants to know his son better and to meet him in Finland, but Meri works in Brussels and Elias therefore moves abroad with his mother. ==Elias' return== Teenage Elias returns to Finland to escape his mother's homophobic boyfriend Vincent. Eventually Sebastian and Meri agree that Elias permanently move to Finland. Elias soon becomes friends with Iida Mustonen, Tale Taalasmaa, and Janne Haukkala. Elias is at that time openly gay. He starts school with his new friends in Finland soon after the case of his father's missing twin brother. On his first day at school Elias encounters Lari, who starts bullying him because of his homosexuality. The bullying continues when Lari and Iida start dating. Soon Elias meets Cindy, and though there are difficulties at the beginning, the two begin to build some kind of mother-son relationship. Soon Elias has a crush on Joonatan Sievinen and kisses him after having misunderstood that Joonatan was gay. After that he begins seeing Ville, with whom he has a budding relationship. Ville however ends up kissing another man at a costume party, whereupon Elias breaks up with him. After the costume party the hockey team chases Elias, but eventually Lari, the leader of the gang, kisses Elias. ==Relationships== Lari V√§√§n√§nen When Lari kisses him Elias realises that Lari is gay as well. Elias soon develops feelings for Lari. Eventually Elias and Lari end up in bed. Though Lari is distressed and avoids Elias at the beginning, it soon becomes clear that the two cannot be separated. Lari gets angry at Elias when he finds out that Elias has told Tale about their kiss. Elias gets a concussion while he is trying to make up with Lari in the ice hall. Concerned, Lari finally has to admit to Elias that he cares about him. Lari leaves Iida and starts a relationship with Elias. Their affair does not remain secret for long, and the friendship between Elias and Iida breaks up when Iida realises that Lari has betrayed her with Elias. Lari's and Elias' affair has a temporary break as well when Lari decides to focus on ice hockey and to go to the training camp in Canada. Lari's homosexuality is revealed to the whole school and Lari, after having been beaten up, has to stop playing ice hockey. In the end Elias comforts Lari, and the two get back together and try to have a more public relationship. However, Elias starts to become anxious because of Lari, who does not dare to be himself in public or to show affection for him publicly. Eventually Lari tells his father Ilkka about his homosexuality, whose strict attitude forces Lari to escape and to live with Elias. Ilkka does not give up easily, but does everything to keep Lari away from Elias. Eventually Lari gives in to his father and goes to a sexual recuperation camp, and Elias no longer stays in the difficult relationship. Elias ends up cheating on Lari with Miska Koistinen, which Lari soon finds out. The two try to make up and Lari leaves his father, but Elias decides to move on with his life. Elias and Lari have continued the relationship for years until Elias' death. Miska Koistinen Elias starts dating Miska because he wants a long, public and open relationship. However, Elias soon finds out that Miska has been lying to him about helping Lari, who has been living in the streets back then, behind his back. Elias also ends up kissing Lari on Lari's birthday and starts feeling uncertain about who he really wants to be with. However, encouraged by his friends and his father, he decides to continue his relationship with Miska and eventually gets engaged with him. At Katharina M√§kel√§'a ball, Elias is shot and sent to the hospital. Soon he tells Lari that he only wants to be friends with him, which pushes Lari to go on to have a relationship with Kalle Laitela. However, Elias soon starts to show jealousy when he sees that Lari was fully himself with Kalle in public. Soon Elias finds out that Miska has been secretly seeing his ex-boyfriend Jonne. Elias is convinced that Miska has cheated on him. ==The kidnapping== Having encountered problems with Miska in their relationship. Elias ends up getting intimate with Lari. Lari is also having problems in his relationship with Kalle. Elias and Lari end up kissing. Soon the two begin investigating Lari's cousin Marianna's past, suspecting that she is mentally ill. Elias and Lari get closer and end up in bed. They, however, try to keep their relationships with Miska and Kalle, but they do not get the chance to, as Marianna, who is afraid of being caught, kidnaps the boys and tells everyone that the two have slept together and gone on a romantic vacation. Eventually Janne, Miska and Kalle trace the captives. Marianna has also kidnapped Janne and Heidi in her small jail room. Later Miska and Kalle come to rescue the captives from Marianna's prison, which has been built in Marianna's room in her and Heidi's home. After the kidnapping The relationship between Elias and Miska ends soon after the kidnapping because Elias still has feelings for Lari and Miska does not want to continue the relationship anymore. Elias tries to get back together with Lari, but Lari chooses Kalle. Miska wants to get back together with Elias after having left Jonne as he realises he still loves Elias. They try to have a relationship again, but Elias decides to leave for Brussels to live with his adoptive mother Meri to \\"get some fresh air for a while\\". Elias, however, comes back in autumn 2015. He soon works for Aki Nikkinen's Vinotar and performs well at work. Elias takes care of Moose's and Vinotar's cooperation together with Lari. Later Elias finds out that Lari has discovered the identity of the kidnapper of Sanni's and Tale's son Ilja and left for the kidnapper's home. Elias goes to Lari with Sergei's illegal gun, which has been left at Sebastian's home. In the kidnapper's apartment there is a scuffle and as a result, the gun goes off and Lari is shot in the side, from which Lari later recovers. Elias' and Lari's love continues to flourish while Lari is recovering, but Elias finds out that Marianna has miscarried Sebastian's baby. Elias gives Marianna a day to tell the truth, but Marianna drives over Elias and kills him, when Elias is on his way to meet Lari for his proposal. ==Love life== *Joonatan Sievinen: Elias kisses and has an unrequited infatuation with Joonatan, but Joonatan is straight and does not return Elias' feelings *Ville Kurtti: ex-boyfriend *Lari V√§√§n√§nen: boyfriend until Elias' death *Miska Koistinen: ex-fianc√© ==References== Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional Finnish people Category:Fictional gay males ","title":"Elias Vikstedt"},{"id":"54255021","text":"Thomas Jenkins (31 January 1871 ‚Äì 28 May 1955) was a missionary bishop of The Episcopal Church, serving Nevada from 1929 to 1942 and later in Oregon. ==Education== Jenkins was born on January 31, 1871 in Shenley, Hertfordshire, England, the son of John Jenkins and Mary Ann Boyles.

In July 2015, the court was reportedly prospecting to buy a lot in the business center through the Department of Budget and Management's funds. At that time the court projects that it would have moved to a newer building by 2019. A contract between the supreme court and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority preceded a groundbreaking ceremony which was held in October 2015 on the lot where the new supreme court building complex will stand. It was projected at that time that the design phase will commence in 2016 and the construction phase will last from 2017 to 2019.

Dubrovskii (; born in 1965) is the head of Laboratory of physics of nanostructures at St. Petersburg Academic University, a leading research scientist at Ioffe Institute, and a professor at St. Petersburg State University and ITMO University. == Educational background == Dubrovskii graduated from St. Petersburg State University, Department of Statistical Physics, in 1988, with a diploma in theoretical physics. In 1991, he was a post-doc research fellow in Oxford University. He obtained his PhD in 1990 and a doctor of sciences degree in 2002, in condensed matter physics. == Contributions to physics == Dubrovskii has made contributions to several fields of physics. ;Semiconductor nanostructures and nanowires He is best known for growth modeling of semiconductor nanostructures, particularly III-V nanowires. Starting from 2003, he has been at the forefront of research in this field, collaborating with more than 40 groups in 18 countries (with joint publications). His main area is in kinetically controlled engineering of nanostructures, including morphology, crustal phase, and size distributions. In 2005, he and coauthors proved a diffusion-induced character of gold- assisted vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of GaAs nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy [1]. In 2008-2014, following Frank Glas [2], he developed theoretical approaches for understanding and controlling polytypism of III-V nanowires by the growth parameter tuning [3] and catalyst material [4]. This allowed achieving record small GaAs nanowires (down to 5 nm in radius) with pure zincblende structure [5]. Independently of Jerry Tersoff [6], in 2013-2015 he predicted a non-linear focusing effect [7,8] that enabled self-organized ensembles of GaAs nanowires with uniform radii [8]. The works of 2016 brought up the new size distributions describing length statistics in nanowire ensembles [9,10]. In 2015-2016, he developed the first theory for the compositional control of ternary III-V nanowires [11], sharpening their axial heterointerfaces [12] and, more generally, nucleation theory of ternary solids from ternary and quaternary liquid alloys. He contributed into understanding the VLS versus selective area growth of nanowires [13] and self-induced nucleation of GaN nanowires on silicon substrates [14]. ;Classical nucleation theory In 2009, Dubrovskii discovered fluctuation-induced broadening (the Dubrovskii broadening) of the size distributions described by a Fokker-Planck type kinetic equation in terms of the Kuni invariant variables [15], and presented a map of the power exponents for the spectrum spreading in 2D and 3D systems. Further studies revealed the influence of kinetic fluctuations on the size distributions of islands and droplets in the stages of their nucleation, growth, and Ostwald ripening [16,17]. He also contributed into binary nucleation theory with a saddle point of the formation energy, with applications in growth theory of strain-induced islands [18] and ternary VLS nanowires. ;Statistical size distributions and scaling properties In 1996, he published exact solution for the infinite set of rate equations for heterogeneous growth with size-linear rate constants [19], reduced to one-parametric Polya distribution. Further investigation of the growth systems with size-linear capture rates led to a two-parametric modified beta-distribution (2015) [20] which acquires the Vicsek-Family scaling form [21] in the continuum limit. Distributions of this type are now widely used for modeling the growth kinetics of semiconductor nanostructures, surface islands and biological objects. ;Self-regulated nucleation and growth in nanosystems Since 2004, Dubrovskii pursued growth theories in confined systems with a limited amount of growth species in the mother phase. He developed concepts of ‚Äúmononuclear‚Äù growth [22,23] whereby individual nucleation events predetermine physical properties of emerging nanomaterials. He developed methods of using different size- dependent effects for narrowing size distributions [8,24-26]. Together with Frank Glas, he predicted narrow sub-Poissonian size distributions [27] in systems with nucleation antibunching [28], and derived analytical asymptotes for their time-independent shapes. ;Elastic relaxation and plastic deformation in nanostructures He and coauthors developed semi-analytical models for elastic relaxation and misfit dislocations in nanostructures grown on lattice-mismatched substrates [29] and contributed into development of epitaxial techniques for monolithic integration of high quality optical III-V nanostructures with silicon electronic platform [8,18,30]. ;Research style Dubrovskii prefers analytical calculations to computers and tries to present theoretical models for complex growth behavior in a simple analytic form with a minimum number of physically transparent parameters. == Current research interests == Dubrovskii main areas are currently in modeling and shaping of sophisticated nanowire nanoheterostructures, nucleation theory in the nanoscale, physical chemistry of alloys and compounds, and analytic size distributions. He is working with experimentalists on design and functionalization of optoelectronic nanoheterostructures. ;Lecture courses and PhD students Dubrovskii is lecturing in nucleation theory, epitaxy of nanostructures and growth modeling of nanowires. He has supervised 10 PhD students, 2 of them under European Marie Curie Initial Training Networks. == Books and book chapters == *V. G.

Located in Socorro County, the refuge lies between the Chupadera Mountains to the west and the San Pascual Mountains to the east and contains 57,331 acres of land along both banks of the Rio Grande. Bosque del Apache at night During the migratory season the refuge can be visited by 12,000 sandhill cranes, 70,000 snow geese, over 40,000 ducks from 14 different species, and over 300 other varieties of bird. Though a prime site for birding, the Refuge also contains a number of muledeer, coyotes, and wild javelina, among other species. ==The wilderness== Established in 1975, the Bosque del Apapche Wilderness is composed of three smaller units, the Little San Pascual Wilderness, which covers 19,859 acres, the 5,429-acre Chupadera Wilderness, and the 5,139-acre Indian Well Unit. The Indian Wells and Chupadera units are located on opposite sides of U.S. I-25, approximately 16 miles south of Socorro, while the Little San Pacual unit is east of Indian Wells on the eastern bank of the Rio Grande. Chupadera National Recreation Trail A designated Wilderness, as described by the Wilderness Act of 1964, motorized vehicles, bicycles and horses are prohibited in the three units. A day-use area, there is no overnight camping, but hikers can access the area year-round between one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset. While off-trail hiking is allowed, there are two developed trails, the Chupadera Wilderness National Recreation Trail in the Chupadera Wilderness, and the Canyon National Recreation Trail in the Indian Well Wilderness. The 9.2 mile Chupadera Trail is a moderately strenuous trail that begins on the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert and climbs over 1800 feet to the top of Chupadera Mountain. Part of this trail includes a one mile loop trail that leads to a scenic overlook in the foothills above the refuge.

On May 29, 2017 he was arrested by the Moroccan police and charged with a list of crimes such as undermining state security, disrespecting the king and receiving funds from abroad used for plots to destabilize the country. These crimes might amount to life imprisonment. He is currently being defended by a team of lawyers, which include Moroccan politician and former Minister, Mohammed Ziane. The arrest of Zefzafi sparked a wave of protests across the Rif and other parts of Morocco, and in the Moroccan community abroad. Protests which were often countered with police violence and counter-protest organized by the palace to suppress those sympathizing with Zefzafi. On June 26, 2018, Zefzafi received a 20-year imprisonment along with the other detainees, including Benjaloun and Ahamjik after numerous cancelled trials since their detention. This verdict created waves of social discontent and sparked outrage among Moroccans. ==Biography== Nasser Zefzafi was born in 1979 in the city of Al Hoceima, northern Morocco. Nasser was born in a politically active family, where his great-grandfather Shaikh l-Yazid n-Hajj Hammu was the minister of interior of the Rif Republic under the rule of Abd el-Krim El-Khattabi. Zefzafi's father was an activist in the leftist party of National Union of Popular Forces. Nasser participated in the 2011‚Äì2012 Moroccan protests that took place of his city of Al Hoceima. ==Protest== Nasser Zafzafi participated in the protests after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a 31-year-old fish seller, who was crushed to death in a garbage truck on October 28, 2016 after trying to recover his confiscated merchandise. In an interview with the news site El Espa√±ol in January 2017, he declares: \\"What has happened to Fikri also affects us: if we keep quiet today, it will continue. That is why we must go out to stop this\\". The spontaneous protests evolved to a movement called the \\"popular movement\\" or the \\"Riffian movement\\", and demanded a list of economical and social reforms, denouncing all kinds of tyranny and corruption. This contestation took a political and identity turn since April 2017, when the Moroccan government initially accused the Riffian movement of separatism and being secretly steered from abroad, while Zefzafi denied all these accusations. ==Arrest== Protest in Paris demanding the release of Hirak prisoners, among which is Nasser Zefzafi On 29 May 2017 Nasser Zefzafi was arrested in Al Hoceima and then shown transported in a helicopter by Gendarmerie to Casablanca, before being charged with \\"threatening national security\\". This was followed with a series of over 100 arrests of other activists related to the movement from Al Hoceima and other cities. Following these arrests, daily protests began in Al Hoceima, Imzouren and other neighboring cities demanding the release of Zefzafi and the other activists. == Comment from the US embassy in Rabat == As part of the many videos circulating the net of pro-king thugs calling for the murder of Zefzafi and often, a number of youth from Tangier in US military garb recorded such a video and called for the murder of Zefzafi. The US embassy in Rabat tweeted a few days earlier, on 5 June 2017 that, \\"The men in msg to Zifzafi video wearing what looks like US military uniforms are NOT US military. We condemn messages supporting violence.\\" and added \\"We can confirm they are definitely NOT members of the U.S. military and we condemn such messages supporting violence.\\". After the tweet the protagonist of the video, quickly recorded another video claiming that they were only joking, and that they actually support Zefzafi and the demands of the protest movement in the Rif, adding that they obtained the US military garb while working as extras in some US movie currently being shot in Morocco. == See also == * Hirak Rif ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Moroccan activists Category:Moroccan democracy activists Category:Moroccan dissidents Category:Moroccan prisoners and detainees Category:Moroccan politicians Category:People from Al Hoceima Category:People of the Arab Spring Category:Riffian people ","title":"Nasser Zefzafi"},{"id":"54255142","text":"The Descente Korea Munsingwear Matchplay is an annual professional golf tournament hosted in South Korea and sponsored by the clothing company Munsingwear.

Originally 64 players qualified to play 6 rounds of 18-hole match-play over 3 days. In 2015 the event was extended to four days with just one round on the first two days. In 2016 the format was revised. At the last-16 stage the players are divided into four groups of four, each playing the other three in the group. Extra holes are not played in the group stage. This stage takes place on the third day and the morning of the final day. The two best group winners then play to decide the winner of the event, with other matches deciding 3rd/4th places, etc. Rankings within groups and then between groups are determined firstly by the number of wins and then by the net number of holes up in the three matches.

Brendon is given the gift of music, Kirby is given the gift of dance, and Nancy is given the gift of magic. Nancy's gift gives her extrasensory perception (ESP), which allows her to sense events that are happening in places she is not physically present and to read other people's minds. The novel explores some of the benefits, problems and responsibilities Nancy's gift gives her. Duncan based the ESP elements of the story on experiments that were conducted on her by J. B. Rhine, who investigated ESP. The characters of Brendon, Kirby, and Nancy were based on the three children she had when first writing the book. In 2012, an updated version of the novel was published with changes to modernize the content, as well as changes to the name and ages to some of the characters. Critical reception for the book was positive, with reviewers particularly liking how Duncan integrated Nancy's gift of magic into the story. ==Plot== Before she dies, a woman gives her grandchildren three separate gifts: Brendon is given the gift of music, Kirby is given the gift of dance, and Nancy is given the gift of magic. Nancy can use that gift to sense events that are happening in places she is not physically present and to tell what others are thinking. Many years later, the children are staying with their mother Elizabeth at their Florida home. Elizabeth tells them that she is getting divorced from their father. Nancy is upset by this and is unhappy to see her mother getting closer to Tom Duncan, Elizabeth's first boyfriend and the counsellor at the high school Nancy and Kirby attend. In her social studies class, Nancy is given a pop quiz. The teacher Ms. Green reads the questions out loud, and Nancy answers questions that Ms. Green has not yet asked. Ms. Green accuses her of getting the questions from her sister, who took the pop quiz before lunch that day. Ms. Green arranges for both of them to meet her in the counsellor's office after school. While there, Kirby tells Mr. Duncan that she had been thinking of the questions on the quiz while they were sitting together during lunch and implies that Nancy read her mind. Mr. Duncan believes that Nancy might have extrasensory perception (ESP) to explain her ability to read people's minds. He tells Dr. Russo, a psychiatrist who has done experiments regarding ESP, about this. Dr. Russo gives her a test where she has to identify cards with their back facing her, and she intentionally guesses the cards incorrectly because she does not want people finding out about her gift. She guesses the cards with the red suit as black and cards with the black suit as red, which further confirms Mr. Duncan's suspicions due to the very low likelihood of doing this by chance alone. Kirby takes dance lessons at a local studio and aspires to be a professional dancer. Her dancing career is threatened when she breaks her leg while falling down a stairway and is unable to move the toes in that leg due to a damaged nerve. Several weeks later, Kirby goes with her mother to the doctor to run some tests on her leg. Simultaneously Brendon and his friend Greg are on a self-made boat to look for treasure said to be buried in a sandbar. They paddle their boat to a sandbar, and as they are searching for the treasure, the sea current pushes the boat further into sea. Greg, who is in the boat, tries to paddle the boat back to the sandbar, but the current is too strong and Brendon is left stranded. Nancy senses that her brother is in trouble and that he is stranded in water. She calls Mr. Duncan and explains the situation, and they agree to meet at the dock in front of Mr. Duncan's house. They use his motorboat to look for Brendon and hear him yelling Nancy's name shortly afterward. Mr. Duncan spots him in the water and pulls him into the motorboat. They later hear that the boat Greg was in reached ground and that Greg was safe. Nancy also receives a call from Kirby telling her that the nerve in her leg has started to repair itself. Nancy becomes more accepting of the relationship between her mother and Mr. Duncan after the events of that day. Mr. Duncan and Elizabeth eventually marry and have a child named Lois, who is born with the gift of storytelling. ==Background and publication history== A Gift of Magic was originally published on September 23, 1971 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. While Duncan was studying at Duke University, she took part in ESP experiments conducted by J. B. Rhine as a way of getting extra credit. Duncan remembered these experiments when looking for a topic for the novel and based the ESP elements of A Gift of Magic upon Rhine's experiments and her feelings about them at the time. The novel was rejected by seven publishers before Little, Brown agreed to publish it. Other publishers felt that young readers would not be interested in the topic of ESP. The characters of Kirby, Nancy, and Brendon were based on the three children she had when writing the book. Kirby's character was based on one of Duncan's daughters who wanted to be a ballerina, but who had to abandon that goal after she realized that \\"she was not going to have the build of a ballerina.\\" The character of Brendon was based on her only son at the time, Brett. Brett played instruments by ear and did not read sheet music, much like Brendon in the story. When Duncan was writing the epilogue, she decided to include a character named after her, explaining that she loved the book and wanted to be in the story as well. She decided that Elizabeth would have a fourth child in the story named Lois Duncan, which meant going back and changing Tom's last name to Duncan. Since Duncan did not have a computer back then, she had to retype her manuscript to make the change. On June 19, 2012, the novel was reissued with changes to modernize the content, and changes to the name and ages of some of the characters. A Gift of Magic, along with The Third Eye, was the last of ten novels by Duncan to be updated. One of the changes made was increasing the age of Kirby and Nancy to fourteen. Nancy was given an age of twelve in the first edition because Duncan originally wrote the book for eight- to twelve-year- olds. For the updated edition, the publisher wanted to target the book for an older audience so that it was more in line with her other young adult novels. To do this, Little, Brown wanted to increase their ages because \\"teenagers don't really want to read about twelve-year-olds\\". The publisher originally suggested making Nancy fourteen and Kirby sixteen, but that presented a problem because Duncan could not identify any professional ballerina that began considerable formal training at that age. They compromised and made both of them fourteen in the updated edition. The name of one of the other ballerina's at the dance studio Kirby attended was changed from Arlene White to Arlene Wright. Duncan explained that she did not want two characters whose last name was a color, so she changed Arlene's last name. Duncan also updated some of the slang in the updated edition. She contacted her teenage grandchildren and her young editors to help keep the slang more up-to-date. A 2012 audiobook based on the updated text was published by Hachette Audio and narrated by Casey Holloway. Amanda Raklovits from the School Library Journal thought that she \\"delivers an adequate performance of Duncan's paranormal tale\\" and that her \\"youthful voice is appropriate for the main characters' ages, though she has a tendency to over-enunciate at times.\\" ==Major themes== A Gift of Magic is Duncan's first novel in which a character has a supernatural trait. This is a theme that has appeared several times in the books she has since written. In the novel, Nancy has to deal with the problems, advantages, and responsibilities her ESP abilities give her. She experiences a problem at school by using the gift to answer questions that the social studies teacher had not yet asked, then getting caught by the teacher. At the end of the book, Mr. Duncan convinces Nancy of a responsibility to not use her gift to try to manage others around her. Mari Ness from Tor.com states that unlike Duncan's other supernatural works, the focus of the novel is acceptance rather than mystery or suspense. In the book, Kirby feels she does not have a dancer's build and has to accept her body, while Nancy has to accept change. Lizzie Skurnick writes in Shelf Discovery that A Gift of Magic is about power. She explains that since Nancy's mother went through a divorce, Nancy learned more about herself and what she could accomplish than if her mother had stayed in \\"an unhappy marriage.\\" ==Reception== In a 1971 review of the novel, Peggy Sullivan from the School Library Journal viewed the book positively, stating that the \\"[b]ackground on extrasensory perception is well woven into the story\\". E. Carey Kenney writes in the journal Best Sellers that Nancy's gift of magic \\"gives pace to the story and leads to an exciting conclusion where she uses her gift to help her brother\\". Kenney did not like the illustrations by Arvis Stewart in the first edition of the novel, feeling that they are \\"extremely sophisticated and do not seem to relate well to the simple realism of the story.\\" Tor.com's Mari Ness said in a 2014 review that the updated novel was a stronger work, stating that A Gift of Magic \\"has a fascinating portrait of someone with immense talent who just doesn't care about it, and several strong family moments\\". == See also == * ==NotesReferencesExternal links== *Lois Duncan's website Category:1971 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Novels by Lois Duncan Category:Little, Brown and Company books ","title":"A Gift of Magic"},{"id":"54255150","text":"The Old St. Helena Parish Jail, adjacent to the courthouse square in Greensburg in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana, was built in about 1855 and is one of the oldest structures in the parish.

Collier unlocked it to allow fellow employees Nathaniel Baker and Bryant Archer to take out the trash. Upon entry, Melson and Peraita ordered Archer, Baker, Collier, and fourth employee Tamika Collins into the restaurant's office and demanded that they empty the safe. They complied, after which Melson ordered the four to get inside the restaurant's freezer. Shortly after locking them in the freezer, Melson unlocked the door and opened fire. Baker, Collier and Collins all died of their wounds before paramedics arrived. Archer was shot four times, but he survived and was able to crawl to the restaurant's office to call 911. ==Legal proceedings== Melson was convicted of his role in the crime, sentenced to death on May 17, 1996, and placed on death row under Alabama Department of Corrections ID 0000Z601. Peraita was sentenced to life without parole. He killed a fellow inmate on December 11, 1999, and was given a death sentence in October 2001. Melson had two execution dates set in 2010, both of which were stayed. On April 5, 2017, Melson had an execution date set for June 8, 2017. He received a temporary stay from an appellate court on June 2, but the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the stay on June 6 without comment. At 5:45 pm on the night of the execution, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay so Justice Clarence Thomas could review Melson's appeals. The stay was later lifted and the execution began at 9:55 pm. Melson was pronounced dead at 10:27 pm. ==See also== *List of offenders executed in the United States in 2017 ==References== Category:1971 births Category:2017 deaths Category:1994 murders in the United States Category:21st-century executions by Alabama Category:21st-century executions of American people Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Place of birth missing Category:Executed African- American people Category:Male murderers Category:American murderers Category:People convicted of murder by Alabama Category:People executed by Alabama by lethal injection Category:People executed for murder ","title":"Robert Melson (murderer)"},{"id":"54255224","text":"Baron Deincourt was a title which was created twice in the Peerage of England.

There was speculation that BPI was compromised by hackers but the bank claimed that the problem was caused by an internal data processing error. The scope of the issue was nationwide according to the bank and also said that only a small portion of its customers were affected and that most of them were in Metro Manila. It was reported that the value of some transactions made from April 27 to May 3, 2017 were doubled. The bank issued a statement that they were resolving the issue and assured that its clients would not lose any money. BPI's stocks in the Philippine Stock Exchange remained unaffected in response to the incident. Luis Limlingan, head of research and sales at Regina Capital Development Corporation viewed that most investors could have seen the incident as a one- off event that could be resolved. According to Limlingan the real problem was how BPI dealt with its disgruntled customers. BPI announced that they resolved the issue at 9 p.m. on June 8, 2017.

In 2019, 1,004 people were shot and killed by police according to The Washington Post, whereas the \\"Mapping Police Violence\\" project counted 1,098 killed. A lack of data has made causal inference about race and policing difficult to study. Research using administrative data provided by police forces can show a lack of racial bias in use of deadly force, but suffers from confounding, especially if a police force engages in racially-biased practices to begin with. If police have a higher suspicion threshold for stopping white individuals than black individuals, then study populations (the black and white people who are stopped) are not similar, which leads to unreliable inferences about racial discrimination in police use of deadly force. Several non-government and crowdsourcing projects have been started to address this lack of reliable data. Police killings are one of the leading causes of death for young men in the United States. A study by Esposito, Lee, Edwards predicts that 1 in 2,000 men and 1 in 33,000 women die as a result of police use of deadly force. The same study predicts the risk is highest for black men, as approximately 1 in 1,000 black men can expect to be killed by police. Studies using recent data have found that Black, Hispanic, and Native American/Alaskan individuals are disproportionately stopped by police and killed in encounters. ==Databases== Although Congress instructed the Attorney General in 1994 to compile and publish annual statistics on police use of excessive force, this was never carried out, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation does not collect these data either. Consequently, no official national database exists to track such killings. This has led multiple non-governmental entities to attempt to create comprehensive databases of police shootings in the United States. The National Violent Death Reporting System is a more complete database to track police homicides than either the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) or the Centers for Disease Control's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). This is because both the SHR and NVSS under-report the number of police killings. Government data collection Through the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, specifically Section 210402, the U.S. Congress mandated that the attorney general collect data on the use of excessive force by police and publish an annual report from the data. However, the bill lacked provisions for enforcement. In part due to the lack of participation from state and local agencies, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stopped keeping count in March 2014. Two national systems collect data that include homicides committed by law enforcement officers in the line of duty. The National Center for Health Statistics maintains the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which aggregates data from locally filed death certificates. State laws require that death certificates be filed with local registrars, but the certificates do not systematically document whether a killing was legally justified nor whether a law enforcement officer was involved. The FBI maintains the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), which relies on state and local law enforcement agencies voluntarily submitting crime reports. A study of the years 1976 to 1998 found that both national systems under-report justifiable homicides by police officers, but for different reasons. In addition, from 2007 to 2012, more than 550 homicides by the country's 105 largest law enforcement agencies were missing from FBI records. Records in the NVSS did not consistently include documentation of police officer involvement. The UCR database did not receive reports of all applicable incidents. The authors concluded that \\"reliable estimates of the number of justifiable homicides committed by police officers in the United States do not exist.\\" A study of killings by police from 1999 to 2002 in the Central Florida region found that the national databases included (in Florida) only one-fourth of the number of persons killed by police as reported in the local news media.\\"Nationally, the percentage of unreported killings by police is probably lower than among agencies in Central Florida...\\" The Death In Custody Reporting Act required states to report individuals who die in police custody. It was active without enforcement provisions from 2000 to 2006 and restored in December 2014, amended to include enforcement through the withdrawal of federal funding for non-compliant departments. An additional bill requiring all American law enforcement agencies to report killings by their officers was introduced in the U.S. Senate in June 2015. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on data from medical examiners and coroners, killings by law enforcement officers (not including legal executions) was the most distinctive cause of death in Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon from 2001 to 2010. In these states, the rate of killings by law enforcement officers was higher above national averages than any other cause of death considered. The database used to generate those statistics, the CDC WONDER Online Database, has a U.S. total of 5,511 deaths by \\"Legal Intervention\\" for the years 1999‚Äì2013 (3,483 for the years 2001‚Äì2010 used to generate the report) excluding the subcategory for legal execution.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Underlying Cause of Death 1999‚Äì2013 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released 2015. Data are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 1999‚Äì2013, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at http://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd- icd10.html on May 18, 2015 23:42:42 UTC Crowd-sourced projects to collect data Mainly following public attention to police-related killings after several well-publicized cases in 2014 (e.g., Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and John Crawford III), several projects were begun to crowd-source data on such events. These include Fatal Encounters and U.S. Police Shootings Data at Deadspin. Another project, the Facebook page \\"Killed by Police\\" (or web-page www.KilledbyPolice.net) tracks killings starting May 1, 2013. In 2015, CopCrisis used the KilledByPolice.net data to generate info-graphics about police killings. A project affiliated with Black Lives Matter, Mapping Police Violence, tracks killings starting January 1, 2013, and conducts analyses and visualizations examining rates of killings by police department, city, state, and national trends over time. The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project started in 2009 by David Packman, is now owned and operated by the Cato Institute. It covers a range of police behaviors. The most recent addition is The Puppycide Database Project, which collects information about police use of lethal force against animals, as well as people killed while defending their animals from police, or unintentionally while police were trying to kill animals. ==Frequency== The annual average number of justifiable homicides alone was previously estimated to be near 400. Updated estimates from the Bureau of Justice Statistics released in 2015 estimate the number to be around 930 per year, or 1,240 if assuming that non-reporting local agencies kill people at the same rate as reporting agencies. Deaths by age group in 2015, according to The Counted Around 2015‚Äì2016, The Guardian newspaper ran its own database, The Counted, which tracked US killings by police and other law enforcement agencies including from gunshots, tasers, car accidents and custody deaths. In 2015 they counted 1,146 deaths and 1,093 deaths for 2016. The database can be viewed by state, gender, race/ethnicity, age, classification (e.g., \\"gunshot\\"), and whether the person killed was armed. The Washington Post has tracked shootings since 2015, reporting more than 5,000 incidents since their tracking began. The database can also classify people in various categories including race, age, weapon etc. For 2019, it reported a total of 1,004 people shot and killed by police. ==Racial patterns== Civilian characteristics According to The Guardian's database, in 2016 the rate of fatal police shootings per million was 10.13 for Native Americans, 6.6 for black people, 3.23 for Hispanics; 2.9 for white people and 1.17 for Asians. In absolute numbers, police kill more white people than any other race or ethnicity, however this is because white people make up the largest proportion of the US population. As a percentage of the U.S. population, black Americans were 2.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by the police in 2015. A 2015 study found that unarmed blacks were 3.49 times more likely to be shot by police than were unarmed whites. Another study published in 2016 concluded that the mortality rate of legal interventions among black and Hispanic people was 2.8 and 1.7 times higher than that among white people. Another 2015 study concluded that black people were 2.8 times more likely to be killed by police than whites. They also concluded that black people were more likely to be unarmed than white people who were in turn more likely to be unarmed than Hispanic people shot by the police. A 2018 study in the American Journal of Public Health found the mortality rate by police per 100,000 was 1.9 to 2.4 for black men, 0.8 to 1.2 for Hispanic men and 0.6 to 0.7 for white men. A 2020 study found \\"strong and statistically reliable evidence of anti- Black racial disparities in the killing of unarmed Americans by police in 2015‚Äì2016.\\" A 2018 study by Harvard professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that there was no racial bias in the use of lethal police force between black and white suspects in similar situations. The study did, however, find that blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely to experience non-lethal use of force. A 2020 study by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer's data are not similar. Nobel-laureate James Heckman and Steven Durlauf, both University of Chicago economists, published a response to the Fryer study, writing that the paper \\"does not establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings\\" due to issues with selection bias. A 2016 study published in the journal Injury Prevention concluded that African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos were more likely to be stopped by police compared to Asians and whites, but found that there was no racial bias in the likelihood of being killed or injured after being stopped. A January 2017 report by the DOJ found that the Chicago Police Department had \\"unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive and deadly force\\" and an independent task force, created by the mayor of Chicago, stated that police \\"have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.\\" A 2018 study found that minorities are disproportionately killed by police but that white officers are not more likely to use lethal force on blacks than minority officers. A 2019 study in The Journal of Politics found that police officers were more likely to use lethal force on blacks, but that this was \\"most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.\\" A 2019 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) found that blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives are more likely to be killed by police than whites and that Latino men are more likely to be killed than white men. According to the study, \\"for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death.\\" A 2019 study in PNAS by Cesario et al. initially concluded from a dataset of fatal shootings that white officers were not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-white officers, but it was later retracted over errors in its methodology. The study was criticized by several academics, who stated that its conclusion could not be supported by the data. It was criticized in a subsequent PNAS article, which stated that it rested on the erroneous assumption that police encounter minorities and whites at the same rate, and that if police have a higher threshold for stopping whites who engage in suspicious behavior than blacks, then the data on police shootings masks the discrimination. PNAS issued a correction to the original article and retracted it in July 2020. A 2020 study in the American Political Science Review found that there was racial bias in who was stopped by police. An early study, published in 1977, found that a disproportionately high percentage of those killed by police were racial minorities compared to their representation in the general population. The same study, however, noted that this proportion is consistent with the number of minorities arrested for serious felonies. A 1977 analysis of reports from major metropolitan departments found officers fired more shots at white suspects than at black suspects, possibly because of \\"public sentiment concerning treatment of blacks.\\" A 1978 report found that 60 percent of black people shot by the police were armed with handguns, compared to 35 percent of white people shot. A 2014 study involving computer-based simulations of a police encounter using police officers and undergraduates found a greater likelihood to shoot black targets instead of whites for the undergraduate students but for the police, they generally found no biased pattern of shooting. Another study at Washington State University used realistic police simulators of different scenarios where a police officer might use deadly force. The study concluded that unarmed white suspects were three times more likely to be shot than unarmed black suspects. The study concluded that the results could be because officers were more concerned with using deadly force against black suspects for fear of how it would be perceived. Officer characteristics Cesario and his coauthors in the 2019 study initially found that the racial identity of police officers is not a significant predictor in the use of deadly force, but it was later retracted as it only measured the probability of being fatally shot and not the probability of being shot in general. ==Policy== Studies have shown that administrative policies regarding police use of deadly force are associated with reduced use of such force by law enforcement officers. Using less lethal weapons, such as tasers, can also significantly reduce injuries related to use-of-force events. ==Legal standards== In Tennessee v. Garner (1985), the Supreme Court held that \\"[i]t is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape,\\" and thus the police use of deadly force against unarmed and non-dangerous suspects is in violation of the Fourth Amendment.Kyle J. Jacob, \\"From Garner to Graham and Beyond: Police Liability for Use of Deadly Force ‚Äî Ferguson Case Study\\", 91 Chicago-Kent Law Review 325 (2016). Following this decision, police departments across the United States adopted stricter policies regarding the use of deadly force, as well as providing de-escalation training to their officers.Tennenbaum, Abraham (Summer 1994). \\"The Influence of the Garner Decision on Police Use of Deadly Force\\". Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. 85: 241‚Äì260. A 1994 study by Dr. Abraham N. Tennenbaum, a researcher at Northwestern University, found that Garner reduced police homicides by sixteen percent since its enactment. For cases where the suspect poses a threat to life, may it be the officer or another civilian, Graham v. Connor (1989) held that the use of deadly force is justified.Sherman, Lawrence (January 2018). \\"Reducing Fatal Police Shootings as System Crashes: Research, Theory, and Practice\\". Annual Review of Criminology. 1: 421‚Äì449. Furthermore, Graham set the 'objectively reasonableness' standard, which has been extensively utilized by law enforcement as a defense for using deadly force; the ambiguity surrounding this standard is a subject of concern because it relies on \\"the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.\\" Kathryn Urbonya, a law professor at the College of William & Mary, asserts that the Supreme Court appears to have two interpretations of the term 'reasonable:' one on the basis of officers being granted qualified immunity, and the other on whether the Fourth Amendment is violated.Urbonya, Kathryn R., \\"Problematic Standards of Reasonableness: Qualified Immunity in Section 1983 Actions for a Police Officer's Use of Excessive Force\\" (1989). College of William and Mary Law School http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/472 Qualified immunity, in particular, \\"shields an officer from suit when [he or] she makes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances [he or] she confronted.\\" Joanna C. Schwartz, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, found that this doctrine discourages people to file cases against officers who potentially committed misconducts; only 1% of people who have cases against law enforcement actually file suit.Schwartz, Joanna (October 2017). \\"How Qualified Immunity Fails\\".

This is also the first season in which the teams pay their players a salary. It would also prove to be the final full season in which Brenda Andress served as commissioner of the league, tendering her resignation on July 18, 2019. ==Offseason== On June 5, 2017, the league revealed at the Hockey Hall of Fame that it would expand into China with the Kunlun Red Star WIH, a women's team associated with the Kontinental Hockey League's Kunlun Red Star men's team. The recent expansions into China is aimed for developing their ice hockey teams for when Beijing hosts the 2022 Winter Olympics. Prior to the official announcement of the team joining the CWHL, Noora R√§ty and American forward Kelli Stack were at the announcement at the Hockey Hall of Fame wearing Red Star jerseys. The league soon added a second Chinese team in the Vanke Rays. On July 11, 2017, it was announced that the Brampton Thunder, a founding franchise of the CWHL and the league's first champions, would be moving east to the Markham community of Thornhill, Ontatio. The move was announced with a press conference at their new arena with commissioner Brenda Andress, Mayor Frank Scarpitti, CWHL Director and esteemed Thunder alumni Vicky Sunohara, interim General Manager Chelsea Purcell (later named GM in August), and many Thunder players present. On September 1, the league announced that it would begin having salaries for their players for the first time. Each player is set to make a minimum of $2,000 per season and a maximum of $10,000 with a team salary cap of $100,000. At the time of the announcement, it made the league the second fully professional women's hockey league in North America after the launch of the rival National Women's Hockey League in the United States in 2015.

The song and its accompanying music video were released on 8 June 2017 via YouTube, with a live debut occurring that same day. It was later released for streaming via Spotify and iTunes on 16 June 2017. == Production == \\"Sleeping Powder\\" was the first song to be recorded and released after the release of Humanz. Through deliberate design (and in contrast to Humanz), it doesn't feature any musical collaborators. Damon Albarn, speaking through the perspective of fictional band member 2-D, explained this decision: \\"2-D felt maybe he was unrepresented on Humanz. It wasn't a problem, but maybe he was a bit too generous, you know? So he thought he'd do a song just by himself, and make a video just with him, and not tell anyone else.\\" \\"Sleeping Powder\\" was written only three days before its June 8 debut, and its video was completed a day prior to release. To facilitate such a speedy turnaround for a music video, motion capture (provided by Albarn) was used for 2-D's animation. Backgrounds were largely composed of assorted stock footage. == Music video == The music video opens with a clip from the 1987 anti-drug PSA, This Is Your Brain on Drugs. 2-D sits at a grand piano, playing along with the song's opening.

He graduated from university in 1906. After his studies he initially worked as a high school teacher in P√§rnu but from 1909 to 1922 was pastor in Laiuse. Already in 1916 he had however taken up a teaching position at the University of Tartu as one of the first ethnic Estonians to do so after the Estonian Declaration of Independence. From 1920 to 1927 he was deputy rector of the university, and from 1928 to 1937 rector. During the interwar period K√µpp was also leader of the Christian People's Party. K√µpp was instrumental in organising and setting up the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1917 and in 1939 he was elevated to the position of bishop and leader of the church. During the first Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 following the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, K√µpp stayed in Estonia. The situation for the church however became strenuous, as most Baltic German priests (who constituted one fifth of the priests in the country) were \\"repatriated\\" to Nazi Germany and as the church was harassed by Soviet authorities. Among other things, land owned by the church was confiscated and the printing of religious books banned. During the following German occupation, things became somewhat easier for the church as most of the pre-war rights of the church were restored. However, the relationship with the German occupational authorities were also not without conflict; for example, the Germans confiscated and melted down church bells to use the materials in the war effort. In 1944, when the Red Army re-occupied Estonia and drove out the Germans, Johan K√µpp fled to Sweden. Half of the active priests in Estonia at the time made the same decision to flee. Before leaving, K√µpp authorised Anton Eilart to act as leader of the church in Estonia; however Eilart was soon arrested by the NKVD and later had to go underground. Following this, K√µpp led the church from abroad. He managed to establish a network among exiled Estonian priests to uphold the organisation of the church and preserve its use of Estonian. Because of this, the church gained international acceptance as the representative of Estonian Lutherans and was among the founding members of the Lutheran World Federation in Lund in 1947. Under the leadership of K√µpp in exile, the church also established an institute for the education of new priests and a magazine, Estonian Church. K√µpp retired in 1965 and died in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from T√µrva Parish Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia Category:Estonian Lutheran bishops Category:Christian People's Party (Estonia) politicians Category:Members of the Riigin√µukogu Category:Hugo Treffner Gymnasium alumni Category:University of Tartu alumni Category:Rectors of the University of Tartu Category:Estonian World War II refugees Category:Estonian emigrants to Sweden ","title":"Johan K√µpp"},{"id":"54255589","text":"This is a list of licensed video games based on tabletop role-playing games and miniature wargames. == Battlecars== Video game based on the Battlecars wargame: *Battlecars (1984) ==BattleTech== For video games based on BattleTech and games in the MechWarrior series, see List of BattleTech games#Video games. == Buck Rogers XXVC== Video games based on the Buck Rogers XXVC RPG: *Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) *Buck Rogers: Matrix Cubed (1992) ==Champions== MMORPG based on Champions RPG: *Champions Online (2009) ==Cyberpunk== Upcoming video game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 RPG: *Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) ==The Dark Eye== For video games based on the German RPG The Dark Eye, see The Dark Eye# Video games. ==Dungeons & Dragons== For video games based on Dungeons & Dragons, see List of Dungeons & Dragons video games. ==Heavy Gear== Video games based on Heavy Gear: *Heavy Gear (1997) *Heavy Gear II (1999) ==Numenera== Video game based on the Numenera RPG: *Torment: Tides of Numenera (2017) ==Ogre== Video games based on the Ogre wargame: *Ogre (1986) *Ogre (2017) ==Rifts== Video game based on the Rifts RPG: *Rifts: Promise of Power (2005) ==RuneQuest== Video game based on the RuneQuest RPG: *King of Dragon Pass (1999) ==Shadowrun== For video games based on Shadowrun, see Shadowrun#Video games. ==Skyrealms of Jorune== Video game based on the RPG Skyrealms of Jorune *Alien Logic: A Skyrealms of Jorune Adventure (1994) == Space: 1889== Video game based on the Space: 1889 RPG: *Space: 1889 (1990) ==Traveller== Video games based on the Traveller RPG: *MegaTraveller 1: The Zhodani Conspiracy (1990) *MegaTraveller 2: Quest for the Ancients (1991) == Tunnels & Trolls== Video game based on the Tunnels & Trolls RPG: *Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan (1990) ==Twilight 2000== Video game based on the Twilight 2000 RPG: *Twilight 2000 (1991) ==Warhammer== For video games based on Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000, see List of Games Workshop video games. ==World of Darkness== Video games based on the World of Darkness: *Hunter: The Reckoning (2002) *Hunter: The Reckoning: Wayward (2003) *Hunter: The Reckoning: Redeemer (2003) *Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Redemption (2000) *Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines (2004) * Category:Video games based on miniatures games Category:Video games based on tabletop role-playing games ","title":"List of video games based on tabletop games"},{"id":"54255597","text":"Alexandros Safarikas (Greek: ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ Œ£Œ±œÜŒ±œÅŒØŒ∫Œ±œÇ; born 26 August 1999) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Swiss club Chiasso, while being on loan from Italian club Lecco. == Career == He began his career by playing for local team Nirea Verias.

Prior to 2017, the two countries maintained cordial ties. Qatar was mainly subservient to Saudi Arabia in matters relating to foreign policy. Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's assumption of power saw Qatar reclaim its sovereignty in foreign affairs, often diverging from Saudi Arabia on many geopolitical issues. In 1996, the Qatari government launched Al Jazeera in a bid to consolidate soft power. One of the most watched news stations in the Arab world, Al Jazeera proved to be a wedge in the two's bilateral relations as it routinely criticized Saudi Arabia's ruler. The network also provided a platform for Islamist groups which are considered a threat to Saudi Arabia's monarchy. Qatar contributed 1,000 troops to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. On 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia along with Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates severed all ties with Qatar. The reason given was Qatar's \\"embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region\\". As part of this campaign, the Saudi-led quartet closed off their airspaces, territorial waters and land borders to Qatar. Saudi Arabia also suspended Qatar's involvement in the Yemen campaign. ==Diplomatic relations prior to the 20th century== It was not until an 1868 maritime agreement that Qatar was recognized as a sovereign entity by the British, who controlled much of the Persian Gulf. The mid-1800s saw the emergence of a centralized seat of power under the House of Al Thani. However, until the signing of the 1868 agreement, ownership of Qatar switched hands often between the House of Al Thani, the Saudis and the House of Al Khalifa. Some time before 1810, the transitory ruler of Qatar Rahmah ibn Jabir Al Jalhami allied himself with the Saudis, offering them partial dominion over Qatar, including the right to collect taxes from Qataris and the adoption of Salafism as the dominant form of Islam in Qatar. The Al Khalifa of Bahrain along with the Sultan of Muscat razed Saudi fortifications in Qatar and Bahrain in 1811, effectually shifting the suzerainty of Qatar from the Saudis to the Al Khalifa. At this time the Saudis were embroiled in a drawn-out war with the Ottoman Empire in the west, so they did not dedicate many troops towards Qatar's defense nor did they contest the Al Khalifa immediately afterward. Nonetheless, over the proceeding years, certain Qatari tribes would pledge allegiance to the Saudis, preferring their rule over the Al Khalifa. This prompted the Al Khalifa to install its own government officials on the Qatari Peninsula in the 1830s to scout for any collaboration between the Qataris and Saudis. ==Political cooperation== Foreign policy Until the late 20th century when Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani assumed the throne, Qatar toed the Saudi line in its foreign policy. Both countries were staunch critics of Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran regime and Israel. Saudi Arabia and Qatar were two of the six co-founders of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981. Even after bilateral relations worsened in the 1990s and 2000s, Qatar still followed the Kingdom's lead in several issues, such as participating in the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain in 2011, participating in the Saudi Arabian- led intervention in Yemen in 2015, and recalling its ambassador to Tehran over the 2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. Nonetheless, after the Qatar diplomatic crisis erupted in June 2017, there has been no political cooperation of any sort between the two, with Qatar going as far as to defiantly reinstate its ambassador to Iran in August 2017. Saudi mediation of Bahrain‚ÄìQatar disputes Saudi Arabia has a decades-long history of mediating disputes between Qatar and its neighbor Bahrain. Relations between the two countries have historically been turbulent due to disagreements over the rightful ownership of several territories. In the 1940s, the Saudis were responsible for mediating a dispute between the two over Zubarah's ownership, being preferred over the British. Saudi Arabia also helped the two reach an agreement over the Hawar Islands. However, the Saudis efforts did not result in any tangible results, and Qatari-Bahraini territorial disputes were referred to the International Court of Justice in 1991. Saudi mediation of internal conflicts in Qatar Saudi Arabia had served as a safe haven for dissidents of Qatar from the mid-20th century onward, ranging from high- ranking members of the Al Thani family to businessmen and common people. Qatar itself had often exiled its most powerful critics to Saudi Arabia. This was usually temporary, with the dissidents returning to Qatar after the Saudi government would negotiate resolutions between the two parties. ==Political tensions== Ascension of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Since he took power in 1995, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from a Saudi vassal state to a rival of Saudi Arabia. When Hamad bin Khalifa assumed power, Qatar was in a better position to chart its own path than any time prior because of the massive wealth it had gained from hydrocarbon extraction. Among his early actions that the drew the ire of the Saudis were forming ties with Iran and Israel and establishing Al Jazeera in 1996. In 1996, a counter coup d'√©tat attempt of Hamad bin Khalifa was foiled. Qatari intelligence indicated that the masterminds behind the attempt were government officials from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Early-to-late 2000s After Saudi Arabia refused to host US troops preparing for the Iraq War, in early 2002 the US signed a military agreement with Qatar culminating in the opening of Al Udeid Air Base. This was an important phase in Qatar's pivot from Saudi influence, since the US base guaranteed Qatar's protection against any possible military interventions by Saudi Arabia and its allies. In July 2002, a broadcast by Al Jazeera featured Saudi religious activist Mohsen Al-Awaji, who criticized Saudi Arabia's involvement in Afghanistan and its approach on the Palestinian question.https://www.albawaba.com/news/riyadh-recalls-ambassador-qatar-over- al-jazeera-rowhttps://cpj.org/2003/03/attacks-on-the-press-2002-saudi-arabia/ For this reason, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies. This approach broadly failed. 2014 Saudi‚ÄìQatari rift During a March 2014 meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), after which the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain announced the recall of their ambassadors to Qatar. This was largely a result of Qatar's backing of Islamist groups, namely the Muslim Brotherhood. Some economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi‚ÄìQatari rift as the tangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural gas producers, which could \\"have deep and long-lasting consequences\\" beyond the Middle East-North Africa area. 2017‚Äì19 Qatar diplomatic crisis On 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia had officially cut ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties due to Qatar's \\"embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region\\", including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom's Eastern Province city of Qatif. Islam Hassan argues that: \\"Starting the 2000 and ahead, Qatar has been pursuing an independent foreign policy that at times clash with the Saudi strategic interests in the region. The fact that Qatar has not been toeing the Saudi foreign policy, and dealing with states and non- state actors that the Saudis do not approve of have caused this tension in relations over the past couple of years, mainly after the Arab uprisings. This tension was revived by the hacking saga of Qatar News Agency and the statement that was attributed to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, which Qatar falsified later. This happened at a time Mohamed bin Salman is facing competition from Mohamed bin Nayef over the Saudi throne. Mohamed bin Salman tried to have the US blessing during Trump's visit to Saudi to force Qatar to its knees, and go back home with a win that would give him more popularity in Saudi Arabia, easing his journey to power.\\" Other experts have argued that, given the strategic and economic imbalance of the relationship, Doha could eventually pay \\"an incommensurate price for having thought it could defy forever the laws of geo-economic gravity [‚Ä¶] Qatar has had to resort to expensive imports from Iran and Oman to circumvent the Saudi-led blockade: such an impractical expediency won‚Äôt be tenable in the long term, as Iran itself is subject to various commercial sanctions and Qatar doesn‚Äôt possess the modern naval infrastructure that may have allowed it to truly withstand the shock\\". Saudi Arabia threatened its Gulf neighbor with military action over Doha's discussions on purchasing the Russian-made air defense system.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/qatar-rejects-saudi-arabias- threats-on-s-400-delivery-envoy/ Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Foreign Minister of Qatar while reacting said in an interview to a TV channel that this threat is an example of 'impulsive behaviour' and is detrimental to GCC stability.https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2018/06/qatar-fm- impulsive-behaviour-threat-gcc-stability-180604141213105.html After boycotting the 2019 Arabian Gulf Cup in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, later in November 2019, announced to participate in the tournament, signaling a thaw to the stand-off between the countries. ==Economic relations== Until the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Qatar imported upwards of 80% of its food from its Persian Gulf neighbors, chiefly Saudi Arabia. The vast majority of food was transported on land through the Salwa Border Crossing connecting both countries. This border crossing was closed in June 2017 and Qatar's trade with the blockading countries was suspended, thereby cutting off Qatar from its primary source of food imports. Imports of pharmaceuticals were also interrupted in Qatar, of which 50 to 60% was supplied by Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. Qatar bypassed the blockade by setting up trade routes with Turkey, Iran and Oman. In May 2018, Qatar declared that it would ban products imported from Saudi Arabia and the three other blockading nations. ==Military relations== During the Bahraini uprising of 2011, Qatar participated in the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain, offering troops to the Peninsula Shield Force to quell the mainly Shiite protestors. Qatar provided 1,000 ground troops for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in 2015. At the onset of the Qatar diplomatic crisis in June 2017, Saudi Arabia suspended Qatar's involvement in the Yemen campaign. Saudi Arabia allowed a Qatari contingent to participate in the Joint Gulf Shield 1 Drill held in April 2018 in the Saudi town of Ras Al-Khair. Although Qatar was traditionally reliant on Saudi Arabia for its security, the Turkish military base in Qatar set up in 2014 allows Qatar to reduce its dependency on Saudi Arabia. ==Media rivalry== Qatari media organisation Al Jazeera was launched in 1996 and within a short time it became one of the most influential news sources for the Arab world. Al Jazeera was regarded as controversial by many Middle Eastern governments, all of whom kept a tight reign on the information consumed by their population. Among other events, the network has granted interviews to Israeli government officials, interviewed with Islamist and terrorist groups, and criticized the rulers of Arab countries. Saudi Arabia regards Al Jazeera as a propaganda tool of the Qatari government used to undermine the region's stability. Mainly due to Al Jazeera's publishing of a peace treaty made between the Saudi and Israeli governments, in 2002 Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador from Qatar in protest. He was not reinstated until 2008. In 2003, Saudi Arabia inaugurated Al Arabiya, which would become the eventual counterweight to Al Jazeera. Al Arabiya has been among Al Jazeera's most vocal critics. Amidst the 2014 Qatar‚ÄìGCC rift, Saudi Arabia halted Al Jazeera's operations in the country over the network's broadcasting of incendiary statements made in interviews and directed at the Persian Gulf monarchies, and its readiness to provide Islamist groups with a podium. At the beginning of the Qatar diplomatic crisis in June 2017, Al Jazeera broadcasting was banned in the Kingdom. Furthermore, its office was shut down and websites were blocked. When the Saudi-led quartet presented their list of demands to Qatar over two weeks later, one of the demands stipulated that Qatar's government close down of Al Jazeera and other Qatar-affiliated media organisations. Saudi Arabia banned Qatari-based beIN Sports on 13 June 2017, shortly after the diplomatic crisis began. beIN Sports is one of the largest sport broadcasters in Asia and holds exclusive licenses with many European leagues for the MENA region. No clear explanation was given for Saudi Arabia's decision to ban the network except that its government made the decision out of \\"concern for the rights of its citizens and residents\\". Months later, a pirated network broadcasting beIN Sports' programmes emerged in Saudi Arabia called \\"beoutQ\\". Qatar accused the Saudi government of being behind the scheme and claimed that beoutQ was formed as a way of subverting Qatar's soft power and global influence. ==Countries of contentionSee also== * Foreign relations of Qatar * Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia * Iran-Arab Relations (Saudi Arabia) * OPEC * Qatar‚ÄìSaudi Arabia border * Qatar- Saudi Arabia diplomatic conflict * Territorial disputes in the Persian Gulf ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Saudi Arabia ","title":"Qatar‚ÄìSaudi Arabia relations"},{"id":"54255839","text":"Arhopala cleander is a species of butterfly belonging to the lycaenid family.

Pepper was born on April 22, 1895, in Georgetown, Delaware, as the son of James Nutter Pepper, Jr. and his wife Margaret B. Simpler. Following his high school studies, he attended the University of Delaware in Newark and graduated with Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1917. Pepper was commissioned second lieutenant on August 6, 1917, and subsequently attended basic training at Marine Officers School at Quantico, Virginia. During November of that year, Pepper was attached to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under the command of John H. Russell Jr. and sailed for his first expeditionary duty in Haiti. He served in Caribbean until January 1920 and took part in many jungle patrols against hostile rebels called \\"Cacos\\". During his time in Haiti, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on July 1, 1918. Following his return stateside, Pepper was attached again to the Marine Barracks Quantico, where he attended Company Officers Course within Marine Corps Schools there. He finished the course in May 1920 and sailed to France, where he was tasked with the preparations of World War I battlefields maps. Pepper was assigned to that mission until December 1920 and then returned to the United States and again to Quantico. In April 1922, Pepper was ordered back to Caribbean and appointed Aide to the American High Commissioner in Haiti, Brigadier General John H. Russell. Pepper was then ordered stateside in August 1924 in order to attend Army Motor Transportation School at Camp Holabird, Maryland. He was meanwhile promoted to the rank of captain on August 20, 1924. Upon graduation from this school in June 1925, Pepper was transferred to Marine Corps Base San Diego, California and attached to the 4th Marine Regiment. His regiment finally sailed for China in February 1927 and Pepper later took part in guard duties at Shanghai International Settlement. Upon his return from China in July 1929, Pepper was appointed an instructor at the Correspondence School at Quantico Base until the beginning of June 1931. In August of that year, Pepper assumed duties as commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS Oklahoma and spent next two years with patrol cruises along the West coast. Pepper returned to San Diego in August 1933 and later was transferred to the Marine Barracks Parris Island, South Carolina. He was sent to the Army Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia, during July 1934 and subsequently graduated from the course in June 1935. Pepper was promoted to the rank of major at the same time and assumed duties as Artillery Assistant in the War Plans Section, Division of Plans and Policies, Headquarters Marine Corps. While in this capacity, Pepper met Lieutenant Colonel Charles D. Barrett and they drew up together the concept of Marine defense battalions, which were designated for the Anti-aircraft and coastal defense of the islands in the Pacific Ocean. ==World War II== Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Pepper (second from right) with the staff of 3rd Defense Battalion on Hawaii. Lieutenant Colonel Pepper left Washington, D.C. in June 1939 and returned to the Parris Island, where he assumed duties as commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 15th Marine Regiment. However his command was redesignated 3rd Defense Battalion on October 10, 1939, and Pepper assumed command of this new unit. For his new command, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on October 1, 1939. He then spent next year with extensive training and then sailed for Pearl Harbor in April 1940. Pepper was replaced in command by Colonel Harry K. Pickett at the end of August 1940 and subsequently took part in the preparation of defense at Midway Atoll. He returned to the command of 3rd Defense Battalion at the beginning of February 1941 and returned to Hawaii, where his battalion was tasked with defense of the islands. During the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Pepper sailed together with Colonel Gilder D. Jackson Jr. aboard the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis to Johnston Atoll to observe the testing of new Higgins boat. Pepper was promoted to the rank of colonel in May 1942 and his unit subsequently sailed to Guadalcanal at the beginning of August 1942 in order to reinforce 1st Marine Division under Major General Alexander Vandegrift. He took part in the Battle of Tulagi and 3rd Defense Battalion under his command successfully hit three enemy ships that had beached themselves to land troops. He later took part in the Battle for Henderson Field at the end of October 1942 and his battalion defensed the Lunga Point against the enemy counterattack from the sea. Pepper remained in command of 3rd Defense Battalion until March 15, 1943, when he was relieved by his executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Harold C. Roberts. For his service on Guadalcanal, Pepper was decorated with the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\". Pepper was subsequently transferred to the staff of the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment located in Australia for rest and refit after heavy combats on Guadalcanal. He relieved Colonel Pedro del Valle as commanding officer on March 29, 1943, and led his regiment to New Britain in December of that year. Pepper went ashore during Gloucester operation on December 26 and his regiment met light opposition at the beginning of campaign. His regiment struggled with difficult terrain, which was improper for the deployment of artillery units. The 11th Marines subsequently provided support fire for the advancing marine units during the assault on airdrome and later during the attack on Aogiri Ridge. Colonel Pepper has been relieved by William H. Harrison at the end of January 1944 and subsequently returned to the United States the following month. After one month of medical leave, Pepper was appointed chief of staff to the commanding general of Camp Lejeune, Major General John Marston. This facility served as boot camp, and Pepper was co-responsible for the training of replacement troops for the marine units deployed overseas. He was also promoted to the rank of brigadier general at the same time. Pepper remained in this capacity until June 1945. For his service in this capacity and his great administrative skills, he was decorated with Navy Commendation Medal. ==Later career== CPT Don King; Parris Island Head Coach, MJR John T. Hill; CPT Billy Hayes; Lieutenant General Graves B. Erskine (Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic) at the Norfolk Naval Base and Major General Robert H. Pepper (MCRDPI), 1952 ‚Äì All Marine Champions. Pepper was then ordered back to the Pacific and assigned to the staff V Amphibious Corps under Major General Harry Schmidt as Corps Artillery Commander. He remained in that capacity until November 1945, when he was transferred to the staff of Fleet Marine Force Pacific on Hawaii. Pepper was appointed deputy chief of staff under the command of Lieutenant General Roy Geiger. He was ordered to the United States in May 1946 and assumed duties as assistant director of personnel at Headquarters Marine Corps. In February 1948, Pepper was promoted to the capacity of director of personnel and spent another year and half in that assignment. During the end of May 1949, Pepper was transferred to Troop Training Unit, Amphibious Training Command, Atlantic Fleet at Little Creek, Virginia, and relieved Brigadier General William A. Worton as its commanding general. In this capacity, he was responsible for the amphibious training of all ground forces within United States Atlantic Fleet. In August 1950, Pepper has been promoted to the rank of major general and assumed duties as commanding general of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. He was responsible for the training of new recruits for next year and half and subsequently relinquished command to his deputy, Brigadier General Matthew C. Horner at the end of January 1952. He was then ordered to Camp Pendleton, California, and assumed command of newly activated 3rd Marine Division. The 3rd Division was reactivated because of the communists threat during the ongoing Korean War and subsequently ordered to Okinawa, Japan, in August 1952. Pepper commanded his division during the several amphibious exercises in Japan and his unit served as defense force of the Far Eastern area. Pepper was transferred to Korea at the beginning of May 1954, and assumed command of 1st Marine Division. His new command was tasked with the defense of Korean Demilitarized Zone, but Pepper did not stay long. He was sent to Hawaii, where he assumed command of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, which included two-thirds of the Marine Corps Combat forces at the time. For his new command, he was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general at the same time. He was transferred to San Francisco at the end of September 1955 and relieved Major general Henry D. Linscott as commander of Department of the Pacific. Pepper was also reverted to the rank of major general. He spent two years with the training and administration of Marine units along the West Coast and finally retired from active service on May 1, 1957, after 40 years of service. He was advanced again to the rank of lieutenant general for having been specially commended in combat. ==Retirement== Grave at Arlington National Cemetery His retirement did not last long, because Pepper was recalled to active duty in July 1960, when he was appointed Marine Corps member of Bolte Committee, which was tasked to study Officer Personnel Act from 1947. In May 1961, Pepper was appointed senior member of the Headquarters Marine Corps Reorganization Board and subsequently member of Department of Defense Study group on Military compensation. Pepper died on June 1, 1968, in Arlington County, Virginia. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery together with his wife Mildred Liebermann Pepper (1899‚Äì1989). ==Decorations== Here is the ribbon bar of Lieutenant General Robert H.

The reserve was established in 1974 to protect one of the region's last remaining herds of Cape mountain zebra (which numbered only five surviving animals in 1976), and to reintroduce game which formerly occurred in the region. It has since been declared a World Heritage Site. The core reserve is 10 430 ha, but the greater Gamkaberg Conservation Area comprises a variety of different protected surrounding areas, and includes 80 000 ha. The Cape Mountain Zebra, the species for which the reserve was originally created ==Location== Mountainous terrain and vegetation of the reserve The terrain of the Gamkaberg is varied, including mountain peaks, plateaus and steep gorges. Fossils and stone age paintings or rock art are also present in the reserve. The nearest towns are Calitzdorp to the north-west; Oudtshoorn to the north- east; and Vanwyksdorp to the south. The mountains which compose the nature reserve form a separate range, within the Little Karoo. The mountain to the west of the Gamkaberg, part of the same range, is also conserved as a nature reserve named the Rooiberg Nature Reserve and the Groenefontein Nature Reserve forms part of that same conservation area, and they are managed together. The river which flows southwards past the reserve shares its name. The Gamka River begins far to the north in the arid Great Karoo and flows southwards towards the ocean. ==Fauna and Flora== Haworthiopsis viscosa in the Gamkaberg Other than the large numbers of Cape Mountain Zebra, other large mammals include leopard, caracal, aardwolf, black-backed jackal, hartebeest, grysbok, and a wide range of other antelope species. The reserve is also home to an unusually large range of reptile and bird species. The flora of the Cape region is one of the richest on the planet. Four of the Cape biomes occur in the Gamkaberg: Fynbos, Succulent Karoo, Subtropical Thicket, and Evergreen Forest. ==Access and accommodation== The nature reserve is open daily for visitors. Accommodation in the nature reserve includes eco-lodges and a campsite, as well as several remote stone shelters in the mountains, which are remains of herders' huts. Accommodation is deliberately rustic and simple, so as to have a minimum effect on the surrounding wildlife and environment. ==Activities== In addition to the animal and plant life, the reserve has an information centre, hiking and 4x4 routes, educational trails, labyrinth, as well as picnic and barbecue facilities. ==Official website== * Gamkaberg Nature Reserve ==References== Category:Nature reserves in South Africa Category:Provincial nature reserves of the Western Cape Category:Protected areas established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in South Africa ","title":"Gamkaberg Nature Reserve"},{"id":"54256000","text":"Ans is a Dutch feminine given name, a short form of either Anna or Johanna.

He also said the government-owned local newspaper, the Cherokee One Feather, was not truly independent despite the free press act, and he intended to make changes to ensure its independence. As one of five candidates, he received 59 percent of the vote in the June 2015 primary. Lambert won the general election in September of 2015 with 71 percent of the vote; the highest vote total ever garnered by a Principal Chief candidate. Internal Political Strife Lambert suspected previous tribal administration of misusing tribal funds. In April 2016, Lambert presented results of a forensic audit to the Tribal Council.He asked the FBI to conduct its own investigation. The Tribal Council ordered an investigation of Lambert in August 2016. After the investigation was completed January 18, 2017, the tribal council voted to impeach Lambert. The FBI was also investigating the Qualla Housing Authority, and Lambert stated that he believed this investigation led to the impeachment action. Vice Chief Richard Sneed replaced Lambert immediately. Following Lambert's departure from office he promised to continue working for better government for the Cherokee, even if he did not hold office.''' == References  External links == Category:Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee Category:Tribal chiefs Category:Titles and offices of Native American leaders Category:History of the Cherokee Category:Cherokee Nation Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Patrick Lambert"},{"id":"54256088","text":"Eleanor Claire Reeves (born 11 December 1980) is a British Labour Party politician, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham West and Penge.

It was commissioned by the public Franco-German TV network ARTE in 2015. It got attention in German and international media after the initial refusal of the two public TV networks ARTE and WDR to release the film. Both claimed the documentary did not live up to their standards. During the ongoing public discussion, the German tabloid Bild decided to show the documentary online for 24 hours without having the rights. Eventually, both, ARD and ARTE, broadcast the documentary on June 21, 2017. == Plot == The main topic of the film is Antisemitism and its modern appearance. Right- and left-wing, as well as Muslim protagonists are interviewed and their shared antisemitic views are uncovered. Also common antisemitic forms, like recurring assault on French Jewish students or the 2014 Sarcelles riots are documented. European Jews talk about antisemitic attacks. Another topic is the BDS Movement and its supporting non-government and Christian Organizations as a part of modern antisemitism. For a better understanding of European antisemitic phenomena, an insight in the Middle East is given as well. Especially the role of Hamas and Fatah in the Gaza Strip is looked at. Palestinian students and Hamas government officials are being interviewed. The whole narrative is being commented by experts throughout the film. == Production == Logo of ARTE, a Franco-German public TV network Logo WDR, a German public broadcasting network Logo of Das Erste, the principal German public TV channel Film locations were Germany, France, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Hungary.

Only when days later Das Erste, a German public TV network related to WDR, decided to broadcast the film, ARTE followed. == Reception ==  France  According to , the documentary is under average. \\"the general thesis has an intolerable intellectual and moral grossness: roughly, a first Holocaust was done by antisemitism intoxicatd Germans (...) and a second is preparing by Arabs/Muslims who have suckle the hate of Jews with maternal milk.\\"\\" He also think that the casting \\"is intellectual manipulation\\"\\"\\" and the authors \\"take the spectators for stupid\\".\\"\\"Marie Caillet, Olivier Milot, ‚ÄúLes Nouveaux Visages de l'antis√©mitisme‚Äù : le doc d'Arte jug√© s√©v√®rement par trois historiens, T√©l√©rama, 2017-06-21. According to , the \\"current forms of antisemitism are serious topics, especially in Europe. This documentary pretends to present them to the public and to denounce them. But, between the intentions proclaimed in the title (...) and the result, the disparity creates the sensation of a big confused and biased g√™chis.\\"\\" He add that \\"the revelation flavour that animates this documentary leads to inexpressive accusations that are poorly documented. Criticize the Israeli organization B'Tselem and the French rapper M√©dine is legitimate. Suggesting that the first is Holocaust denier and that the second considers that \\"the Zionists rule the world\\" is libelous\\".\\"\\" According to Nicolas Lebourg, \\"in this movie, which can not be called a documentary, the spectator of conspiracist videos will find himself with pleasure: the transnational anti-Israeli octopus is everywhere, beating colossal flow of money, directs the media and politics\\".\\"\\" He also think that \\"two typical processes of conspiracy theories are constantly used: the amalgam and the confusion between the part and the whole. The antisemitism, the anti-Judaism and the criticism of Israeli politics are treated as a single object, so that Christianity, Islam and European civilization are depicted as fundamentally anti-Jewish\\".\\"\\" About the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, the movie move from the \\"Palestinian president to a Nazi dignitary, through World War II through the character of the Grand Mufti only, the 900,000 men of the Waffen SS are reduced to Bosnian Muslim volunteers, and, after having reduces Nazism to the Grand Mufti, it is the Palestine Liberation Organization which is reduced to him. From here we go to Arafat, described without evolution, and on the money that Europe spend for the Palestinians. A money wasted because the palestinian territories would benefit from an economic and technological development allowed by Israel but helpless destroyed by corruption: we are there in a typical colonial representation, and at the same time as in this process of confusion between parties and totality of phenomena\\".\\"\\"  Germany  Shimon Stein, Israels ambassador in Germany 2001 to 2007, wrote in Zeit: \\"The documentary of hatred against Jews in Europe confuses criticism of Israel with Antisemitism. Thereby it fails to show the real problem: the classical Antisemitism.\\" The critique was published under the title \\"Antisemitism‚Äîthe enemy is right-wing.\\" Historian Michael Wolffsohn described the documentary as \\"by far best, smartest and historically deepest documentary on this topic, while at the same time being very much up to date and true.\\" Berlin-based Islamism expert and author Ahmad Mansour, directly involved in the film as key advisor and provisional co-author, praised the film as \\"great and overdue.\\" G√∂tz Aly, a German historian and political scientist said: \\"The film documents the corrupt, Hamas-controlled 'self-administration' of UN relief funds in Gaza. Now, Arte's program director Le Diberder claims that the film lacks 'multiple perspectives'. The opposite is true.\\" Arno Frank, journalist by Spiegel Online, emphasized that the film had major production flaws. Mirna Funk writing in Zeit described it as a propaganda film and said it covers only very little of antisemitism in Europe, its main focus is labeling criticism towards Israel as antisemitism. Peter Ullrich from Center for Research on Antisemitism claimed that the film had interesting details, but was poorly made and is misleading. Both WDR and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung journalist Matthias Drobinski see great production flaws in the documentary. The SZ journalists furthermore claims that the film was produced out of the anger of the filmmakers, the film was less of a documentary but rather a statement or polemic. The viewer has to be on the side of the producers; if not, so the documentary indicates, the viewer will be on the side of Hamas and Julius Streicher. Matthias Drobinski concludes that a film about modern antisemitism is important, but that the lack of craftsmanship was sad. Bild made the documentary public. On the same day, Arte responded with a press release stating that Arte had noted that Bild.de had put the documentation online on its own responsibility. \\"Even though this approach is strange, ARTE has no objection to the public's own opinion on the film.\\" Furthermore:  International  The Simon Wiesenthal Centre requested the European Parliament to screen the film in its chamber as a reaction of ARTE's initial refusal to broadcast the film. == Reactions == Six investigators are researching the statements in the film according to the WDR. == See also  Sources == Category:2017 television films Category:French television films Category:German television films Category:French documentary films Category:German documentary films Category:French-language films Category:German-language films Category:French- language television shows Category:German-language television shows Category:Islam and antisemitism Category:Documentary films about antisemitism Category:French films ","title":"Chosen and Excluded ‚Äì The Hate on Jews in Europe"},{"id":"54256199","text":"John Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Ahlquist III (born January 25, 1968) is a business owner, commercial real-estate developer, and retired physician from Idaho. He is the CEO of the development firm, Ball Ventures Ahlquist (BVA). Prior to that, he was the COO of the Gardner Company where he helped develop projects like the Eighth & Main building and City Center Plaza in downtown Boise. He was a candidate for the Republican Party nomination for Governor of Idaho in the 2018 Idaho gubernatorial election. ==Early life and education== Eagle Scout award. Ahlquist was born on January 25, 1968, in Hunter, Utah, (now West Valley City, Utah) and grew up on a small family farm. Both of Ahlquist‚Äôs grandfathers worked for Kennecott Copper. His father, Tom, worked as a journeyman electrician when he was young and later as a construction manager for large commercial projects. His mother, Sandra, has owned her own preschool for nearly forty years. At the age of thirteen, Ahlquist earned his Eagle Scout Award, and then drew national attention by becoming one of only a few Scouts in the history of the Boy Scouts of America program to earn all 121 merit badges. Ahlquist was honored with a commendation from then-Utah Governor, Scott M. Matheson. Ahlquist attended Cyprus High School in Magna, Utah where he participated in athletics and student government. He earned several awards for academic excellence and leadership and graduated in 1986. After high school, Ahlquist moved to Rexburg, Idaho to attend Ricks College (now Brigham Young University‚ÄìIdaho) where he played basketball and studied pre-med. After a year at Ricks College, he left to serve as an LDS missionary in Brazil. Upon his return in 1989, he enrolled in the University of Utah, where he managed the Pediatric Intensive Care Research Laboratory at the university while attending school. He graduated from the University of Utah with a BA degree in biology and a minor in chemistry in 1992. Ahlquist continued to study medicine at the University of Utah, graduating as a Doctor of Medicine in 1996. ==Medical career== Ahlquist completed an emergency medicine residency at the University of Arizona in 1999. While there, he served as the chief resident and earned the award for Resident of the Year. He is board certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine. After residency, Ahlquist began working as an attending physician in Boise, Idaho for St. Luke's Health System and has worked in emergency rooms across the state of Idaho for over 15 years. He was the head of the Emergency Department at St. Luke's Meridian Medical Center in Meridian, Idaho and worked the night shift there for six years. Ahlquist retired from full-time work as an emergency room physician in 2014. In 2001, Ahlquist co-founded a public access defibrillator service company called Stat Pads. The company sells defibrillators and offers training to medical personnel. In his role as a developer, Ahlquist has also helped build numerous health care-related facilities in and around Boise, including The Portico and Unity Health Center in Meridian and several ongoing projects with the Saltzer Health, a Nampa- based health system. Ahlquist acquired Saltzer Health through his Ball Ventures Ahlquist (BVA) development company in January 2019. ==Developer career== In 2006, Ahlquist founded Ahlquist Development and began developing commercial real estate. After developing several smaller buildings, Ahlquist Development partnered with Gardner Company. Their first major joint development was The Portico at Meridian, a 7-building, 328,000 square-foot, mixed-use project in Meridian, Idaho. In 2005 and 2006, Ahlquist convinced 18 residents to sell their properties on the land that would become The Portico. Multiple joint venture projects followed in the Treasure Valley area including St. Luke's Medical Plaza in Nampa and Eagle Island Crossing in Eagle. In 2010, Ahlquist Development merged with Gardner Company and the new entity retained the Gardner Company name. Ahlquist became COO of the company at the time of the merger. One of the most prominent projects Ahlquist worked on as COO of the Gardner Company was the property on Eighth & Main in Boise. Known colloquially as the \\"Boise Hole\\" because it had sat vacant for 25 years, the property was purchased by the Gardner Company in July 2011. The 18-story Eighth & Main office tower (also known as the Zions Bank building after its primary tenant) broke ground in 2012 and was completed in 2014, becoming the tallest building in Idaho. In 2013, the Gardner Company purchased the U.S. Bank building, Idaho's second-tallest building. On the property around the tower, Ahlquist and the company helped develop the 400,000 square-foot City Center Plaza. The facility was completed in 2016 and included an underground transit center, new retail, an expanded convention center, Boise State University Computer Science Department, and the corporate headquarters for Clearwater Analytics. As COO of the Gardner Company, Ahlquist has led the development of numerous other properties in the Treasure Valley area, including the West Valley Medical Complex in Caldwell, Library Square in Nampa, Mace River Ranch in Eagle, and the ongoing Pioneer Crossing development in Downtown Boise. In 2016, Ahlquist led the formation of a new division of Gardner Company in collaboration with the Brighton Corporation focusing on a continuum of care for seniors through independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing facilities all tied into local health systems called Veranda Senior Living. Veranda currently has two locations in Meridian and Boise. In June 2018, Ahlquist left his post as COO of the Gardner Company to head a new joint venture with Ball Ventures called Ball Ventures Ahlquist LLC (BVA). In September of that year, Ahlquist announced plans for a 90,000 square-foot medical office complex in Meridian called Central Valley Plaza. The development will also feature retail space. In addition to Central Valley Plaza, BVA was working on Ten Mile Crossing in Meridian and Pioneer Crossing, both of which were bought by BVA from Gardner. In January 2019, Ahlquist led BVA's acquisition of the Saltzer Medical Group, a Nampa-based health system. BVA changed the group's name to Saltzer Health shortly thereafter. BVA is planning to include Saltzer Health locations in its Ten Mile Crossing, Central Valley Plaza, and other developments. Other projects that Ahlquist is working on as CEO of BVA include Eagle View Landing in Meridian and an as yet unnamed development off of Interstate 84 in Caldwell. ==Political career== Ahlquist was a finalist for the Idaho State Department of Education Board opening in July 2014 when Milford Terrell announced that he was stepping down early from his term. David Hill, formerly with Idaho National Laboratory, received the appointment. He was a founder of Idaho 2020, a bipartisan think tank aimed at bringing together business leaders from around Idaho to focus on challenges facing the state. In 2015, the group studied the state's level of investment in infrastructure and developed suggestions for leaders and lawmakers. In January 2016, Ahlquist delivered a speech detailing the data collected at the Idaho Chamber Alliance and also presented the information to the Idaho state legislature. 2017 presidential election Ahlquist supported Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and served as his financial co-chair for Idaho. He did not support eventual President Donald Trump in the general election and wrote in Marco Rubio. However, Ahlquist noted later that he supported and agreed with Trump as President. 2018 Idaho gubernatorial race On March 1, 2017, Ahlquist announced his candidacy for the 2018 Idaho gubernatorial election in an event at the Zions Bank tower he helped develop. He also announced that he would be embarking on a 97-city campaign tour of the state, which he started later that week and finished in May 2017. His three main platforms were fixing Idaho's health care gap, economic development, and education. On September 5, 2017, he added a plank that called for ethics reform and term limits for various offices in the state. Throughout the race, Ahlquist was considered one of three Republican front-runners alongside Idaho Lieutenant Governor Brad Little and U.S. Representative Ra√∫l Labrador. In October 2017, he received an official endorsement from Mitt Romney. He later received endorsements from conservative commentators, Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens. On May 15, 2018, Ahlquist earned 26.2% of the vote in the Idaho Republican Party primary election, falling behind Ra√∫l Labrador (32.6%) and the eventual governor Brad Little (37.3%). ==Community Service== Ahlquist has served on multiple community boards and subcommittees, including Family Advocates, United Way of the Treasure Valley, YMCA, Boys & Girls Club, Boy Scouts of America Ore-Ida Council Board, Treasure Valley Leadership Alliance, Boise Valley Economic Partnership, Idaho Technology Council, Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce, Idaho State University President‚Äôs Advisory Board,{{Cite weburl=http://headlines.isu.edu/?p=3811title=Idaho State University University of Arizona Emergency Medicine Research Center Advisory Board, American Heart Association, March of Dimes, Go Red for Women, and the FACES of Hope Victims Center. ==Personal life== Ahlquist is married to Shanna Mullins, his high-school sweetheart. They have four children. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served as a stake president in the Meridian Idaho North Stake of the LDS Church from October 27, 2013 to February 4, 2017. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Ball Ventures Ahlquist official website Category:Idaho Republicans Category:1968 births Category:Brigham Young University‚ÄìIdaho alumni Category:Latter Day Saints from Idaho Category:Eagle Scouts (Boy Scouts of America) Category:American emergency physicians Category:Living people Category:People from West Valley City, Utah Category:University of Utah alumni Category:American healthcare managers ","title":"Tommy Ahlquist"},{"id":"54256202","text":"Bittacomorpha clavipes, known as the phantom crane fly (though this name can also apply to any member of Ptychopteridae), is a species of fly in the family Ptychopteridae.

She is the constituency's first female MP. In February 2020 she was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Apprenticeships and Skills. ==Early life== Keegan grew up in Knowsley, Merseyside, and went to St Augustine of Canterbury Secondary School (renamed St Thomas Becket Catholic High School) in Huyton. She has a bachelor's degree in Business Studies from Liverpool John Moores University and a Master of Science in Strategy and Leadership (Sloan Fellowship) from London Business School in 2011. ==Professional career== Keegan started her career aged 16 as an apprentice at a car factory in Kirkby and went on to have a business career working at Delco Electronics (part of the General Motors Group), NatWest Bank (Senior Buyer), MasterCard International (Commercial Director), Amadeus IT Group (Group Vice President of Multinational Customer Group based in Madrid) and Travelport (Chief Marketing Officer) over 27 years. ==Political career== Keegan says that it was her experiences of trade unionism and the Militant- controlled Liverpool City Council while working in Kirkby in the 1980s that convinced her to support the Conservative Party. However, she did not become active in politics until 2014. In 2015, she was advised in her ambitions to become an MP by Justine Greening, whom she met by chance at a London Business School (LBS) reunion; according to her, this demonstrated the power of the LBS network. She unsuccessfully contested the constituency of St Helens South and Whiston in the 2015 general election. In 2015 she became Director of Women2Winan organisation founded by Theresa May and Baroness Anne Jenkin in 2005 to help elect more women Conservative MPs to Parliament. She had left that position by September 2017. Keegan was elected as a councillor for the Rogate ward on Chichester District Council in 2014. She was appointed cabinet member for commercial services in May 2015. She stood down as a councillor in February 2018 and in the election that followed in April 2018, the seat was taken by the Liberal Democrat candidate Kate O'Kelly. Keegan went on to beat O'Kelly by 21,490 votes in the General Election in December 2019. Keegan was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for the Chichester constituency in May 2017, and was elected to the House of Commons in the General Election held on 8 June 2017. In September 2017, she was appointed to the Public Accounts Committee. Gillian Keegan was appointed PPS to HM Treasury in September 2018.

Keegan endorsed Rory Stewart during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. Gillian Keegan became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Home Secretary in May 2019. Gillian became PPS to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in September 2019. In February 2020, Keegan was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Apprenticeships and Skills, a junior ministerial role at the Department for Education. In August 2020, Gillian Keegan was criticised for being on holiday during the A-Level results crisis however, Keegan defended herself by clarifying that she was not the Minister responsible for A-Level and GCSE qualifications. Keegan explained that she had indeed been the duty Minister for the first two weeks of summer recess and had obtained special permission to take her government PC to continue working during this period. ==Other interests== Keegan was a member of the Board of Governors of Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from 2015 to 2017. ==Personal life== Keegan, who owns several properties and has homes in France and Spain, lives in Petworth in West Sussex with her husband Michael, CEO of Fujitsu UK and Ireland, and has two stepsons.

He lost his positions for having joined an aristocratic revolt against Queen Tamar of Georgia. Botso's parentage is not known. His father could have been either Murvan Jaqeli of an inscription from the Agara monastery, near Akhaltsikhe, or Memna, mentioned by Stepanos Orbelian as a participant of the 1178 revolt against George III of Georgia. Botso Jaqeli's namesake and possible grandfather is recorded as eristavt-eristavi (\\"duke of dukes\\") in a Georgian stone inscription from the Ali monastery, now in Turkey, and marzpan (\\"margrave\\") in a note attached to the 12th-century Gelati Gospels manuscript. According to the historian Cyril Toumanoff, Botso's successor as duke of Samtskhe, Ivane-Qvarqvare Jaqeli, was his brother. Botso's possible sister, Kravay, was married to the nobleman Samdzivari and was responsible for negotiating the surrender of Qutlu Arslan's rebellious party to Queen Tamar. Botso Jaqeli appears as eristavi (\\"duke\\") and spasalar (\\"constable\\") of Samtskhe, an important frontier region in southwest Georgia, in the reign of Queen Regnant Tamar. Around 1187, Botso, together with Guzan, duke of Tao, repelled an attack from Saltukid Erzurum and Sham into the provinces of Shavsheti and Klarjeti. Around 1191, Botso joined the likes as Vardan Dadiani and Guzan of Tao in a failed coup in favor of Tamar's disgraced husband, George the Rus'. Botso's subsequent fate is not clear; he seems to have been deprived by Tamar of his patrimonial castle of Jaqi as well as of his possession and command of Samtskhe for these dignities then appear as belonging to Ivane-Qvarqvare Jaqeli, Botso's kinsman and, according to Toumanoff, his possible brother. Botso's sons and descendants were known as Botsosdze. His elder son, Memna, also known as Ivane, was killed, being in charge of the defense of Tbilisi against the Khwarazmian army in 1226. A younger son, Botso (died c. 1283), also took part in this battle, commanding the last stand at Isani. This Botso was married to Vaneni, daughter of Ivane Abuserisdze, duke of Adjara, and sister of the scholar Tbeli Abuserisdze. The Botsosdze are last heard of with Shalva in the 1260s. By 1516, their estates in Samtskhe appear in possession of the Oladashvili family. == Notes  References == * * * Botso Category:12th-century people from Georgia (country) ","title":"Botso Jaqeli"},{"id":"54256348","text":"The Gasport Dolomite is a geologic formation in Ohio.

Margot is sad, but gets a husband and never shows her breasts to anyone else again. http://www.georges-brassens.com/ ==Cover versions== The song has been covered by Patachou in the 1953 film Women of Paris. Renaud covered it too on his 1996 album Renaud chante Brassens.http://www.georges- brassens.com/ ==In popular culture== When Brassens died in 1981, French cartoonist Jean-Marc Reiser made a graphic homage in which a man sits in a train talking about his disgust with Brassens' filthy lyrics. While he talks a young woman sitting in front of him breastfeeds her cat in the manner of Brave Margot. This sight touches him as he recognizes the image from the song, causing him to reconsider his opinion about Brassens' music. ==SourcesExternal links== * Lyrics. * {http://www.analysebrassens.com/?page=texte&id;=14&%23 An analysis of the song (in French).} * {https://web.archive.org/web/20160820234356/http://www.dialogus2.org/BRA/margot.html } Category:French songs Category:1953 songs Category:Songs about cats Category:Songs about shepherds Category:Songs about fictional female characters Category:Breastfeeding in art Category:Fictional shepherds Category:Fictional French people Category:Songs written by Georges Brassens Category:Georges Brassens songs ","title":"Brave Margot"},{"id":"54256368","text":"Arhopala democritus or white-dot oakblue, is a species of butterfly belonging to the lycaenid family described by Johann Christian Fabricius in 1793.\\"Arhopala Boisduval, 1832\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms.

It was located in the DAœïNE collider at the INFN Frascati National Laboratory in Frascati, Italy. It ceased operation in 2006 and was replaced by the KLOE-2 detector, which began operation in 2014, and continues to operate to this day. ==Etymology== Both the DAœïNE collider and the KLOE detector were named after the two titular characters of the ancient Greek play Daphnis and Chloe, written in the second century AD. In the story, the two grow up and fall in love, experiencing various hardships before living happily ever after. The DAœïNE collider was designed with the KLOE experiment as its primary goal, leading to the two to be named as a pair. ==KLOE== The KLOE experiment was the first experiment performed by the DAœïNE collider. It began in ernest when the detector began taking data in 2000 and ended when data collection stopped in 2006. The KLOE detector was designed to witness the decays of mesons that were created by colliding electrons and positrons at high speeds to generate large numbers of mesons, of which then decay into the pair, following the second most common decay mode. The detector was cylindrical in shape. It had a length of 6 meters and a diameter of 7 meters and was composed of a drift chamber surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter, both of which were kept within a constant magnetic field. The interior drift chamber had a length of 3.3 meters and a diameter of 4 meters, within which it contained 52,000 wires, making it the largest drift chamber ever constructed at the time. The computer interpreting its data was able to calculate reconstructed particle trajectories with a precision of within 0.3%. The electromagnetic calorimeter had a length of 4.5 meters and a diameter of 4 meters. It used alternating layers of lead with 15,000 kilometers of scintillating fibers before passing the energy from the fibers through 4880 photomultipliers. It was able to determine the energy released by a given particle to within 15% precision, and was able to distinguish between particles occurring at least 0.2 nanoseconds apart, but was limited to the computer's ability to calculate a maximum of 2000 events per second. ==KLOE-2== KLOE-2 began taking data in November 2014 and is scheduled to continue taking data until at least 2018. Its first run, Run-I was begun in November 2014 and continued until July 2015, observing a total of 1 billion neutral kaon decays. The second experiment, Run-II is still in progress and aims to reach 5 billion such observations. Its drift chamber has the same dimensions as KLOE. It also uses lead and scintillating fibers and the same number of photomultiplier tubes. It uses a magnetic field strength of 0.52T. ==References== Category:Experiments ","title":"KLOE (experiment)"},{"id":"54256399","text":"Maialino! / „Äå...„ÄÇ„Äç no Tsuzuki ~Eien Nante Nai...

Pusser's Ltd had an authorised share capital of $4.4m divided into 4.4m class A shares of $1 each, of which 1,673,217 shares and warrants for another 248,000 had been issued. Each class A share or warrant carri ed one vote. On 16 March 1994 at an extraordinary general meeting the shareholders of the company voted by special resolution to amend its articles of association to create 200,000 new class B shares, each of which would carry 50 votes. It further resolved that 200,000 of the class A shares held by the chairman of the company, Charles Tobias, should be converted into class B shares.

Court of Appeal Pussers then appealed. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal handed down its decision on 20 September 2004, Gordon JA giving the judgment of the court. The Court of Appeal reversed the judge at first instance, holding that he had applied the wrong test. However they cautioned that although the amendment itself was lawful, that the behaviour of the main shareholders of Pussers might expose the company to a derivative action. Citco then appealed to the Privy Council. Privy Council The advice of the Privy Council was given by Lord Hoffman. The advice of the Privy Council was given by Lord Hoffman. His Lordship noted that the courts have always treated the power to amend a company's constitutional documents as subject to certain limitations. In Andrews v Gas Meter Company [1897] 1 Ch 361 it was accepted in principle that companies could create classes of shares with preferential rights. He then reviewed the decision of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656. In that case the company amended the articles to extend its lien to fully paid shares. Only one shareholder held fully paid shares and so the amendment operated to the disadvantage of that shareholder. Despite this the Court of Appeal held the amendment valid. Lord Hoffman cited with approval the statement of Lindley MR: Lord Hoffman then considered a number of further cases which considered what \\"bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole\\" meant, including Shuttleworth v Cox Brothers and Co (Maidenhead) Ltd [1927] 2 KB 9, where he approved the statement of Scrutton LJ: He also reviewed the decision in Rights & Issues Investment Trust Ltd v Stylo Shoes Ltd [1965] Ch 250 where the articles were amended to double the number of votes attached to special management shares in order to maintain the control of the existing management. In that case Pennycuick J accepted that the amendment was valid. He further considered Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd [1951] Ch 286, where the relevant amendment was to remove a pre-emption clause to facilitate a sale of control to a third party, and Sir Raymond Evershed MR stated that \\"the company as a whole\\" did not mean the company as a corporate entity but \\"the corporators as a general body\\" and that it was necessary to ask whether the amendment was, in the honest opinion of those who voted in favour, for the benefit of a hypothetical member. He noted that some commentators have not found the approach in that case helpful, but stated that \\"for the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to discuss such cases any further\\". Lord Hoffman then noted that the burden of proof lies upon the person who seeks to challenge the validity of an amendment (applying Peters' American Delicacy Company Ltd v Heath (1939) 61 CLR 457). After that review, Lord Hoffman considered the decisions below, and indicated that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal was correct. They rejected the argument of Citco's counsel that the votes of Tobias should be discounted, noting that Evershed MR had said in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd [1951] Ch 286 (at 291): \\"It is ... not necessary to require that persons voting for a special resolution should, so to speak, dissociate themselves altogether from their own prospects...\\" They noted that there was no attack on the bona fides of the vote, only its outcome. Accordingly, they advised that the appeal should be dismissed and the amendment upheld. ==See also== *British Virgin Islands company law ==References== Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from the British Virgin Islands Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:2007 in case law Category:2007 in the British Virgin Islands Category:2007 in British law Category:British Virgin Islands company law cases ","title":"Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd"},{"id":"54256494","text":"Testechiniscus is a genus of tardigrades in the family Echiniscidae.

She has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle since the 2017 general election. Until May 2019, she was also a member of Hessle Town Council focusing on NHS and education. Hardy is a member of Labour's National Policy Forum and was an education union employee. ==Early life and education== Emma Hardy was born and brought up in North Newbald, Humberside, a few miles from the Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle constituency she now represents in Parliament. She attended Wyke Sixth Form College to study her A-Levels before studying for an undergraduate degree in Politics at the University of Liverpool, graduating in 2001. She then completed a PGCE at the University of Leeds in 2004, and taught for over ten years at Willerby Carr Lane Primary School. Hardy became politically active in 2011, after joining a campaign protesting against school cuts and meeting Alan Johnson, the then-MP for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. She left teaching in 2015 to become a full-time organiser for the National Union of Teachers, and served as Deputy General Secretary of the Socialist Educational Association before being elected to Parliament. ==Parliamentary career== Hardy was selected as the Labour Party's prospective parliamentary candidate for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle after the then-MP, Alan Johnson, announced his retirement just weeks before the general election in 2017. She was one of 256 women candidates put forward by the Labour Party at that selection, and was elected on 9 June 2017, with a majority of 8,025. Unsuccessful candidates at that election included The Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry, who stood as an independent. Since her election, Hardy has sat on the House of Commons Education Select Committee. There, she has challenged the Government to ban informal exclusions, voiced support for the teaching of oracy (fluency in spoken communication), and promoted the benefits of a broad curriculum which includes the arts, music and sports. In September 2018, Hardy began to work closely with the women's health charity Endometriosis UK to push for \\"menstrual wellbeing\\" to be included as part of the sex and relationship education in schools. On 25 February 2019, the UK government announced that menstrual wellbeing would be included in the curriculum going forward. Hardy is also the Vice Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Mesh, and has fought a successful campaign to get the Government to back down on the routine use of vaginal surgical mesh in the NHS. In October 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) declared that vaginal mesh surgery should only be used as a \\"last resort\\" to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. This will spare thousands of women from the horrific side effects of vaginal mesh surgery that women have endured since 2003. Since 2017, Hardy has also worked as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Keir Starmer MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Hardy has campaigned locally in her constituency to secure the funding for the A63 Castle Street development, prevent any further delays and ensure a bridge was built as soon as possible. Following delays to the project, building for the bridge started in October 2018, and the A63 road development is on course to start in March 2020. Hardy has also lobbied successfully to bring money to Hull for a new Children and Adolescent Mental Health Unit. The money was agreed by the Government in July 2018 and the project was finally completed in January 2020 . Amongst her other campaigns, of paramount importance to Hardy is the wellbeing and betterment for children, she is continually fighting to ensure children and young adults receive the support and services they need to fulfil their potential. Hardy is also a patron for Articulacy which strives to improve lives by inspiring all people regardless of age or abilities to become confident and articulate individuals. In January 2020, Hardy was appointed to Labour's frontbench as a Shadow Education Minister, succeeding Gordon Marsden, who lost his seat in the 2019 general election. Hardy nominated Keir Starmer in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election and Angela Rayner in the deputy leadership election. ==Personal life== Hardy lives in Hessle with her partner James, her two daughters Olivia and Isabelle and cats Thomas and Serena. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Schoolteachers from Yorkshire Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:English trade unionists Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Councillors in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Alumni of the University of Liverpool Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds ","title":"Emma Hardy"},{"id":"54256497","text":"The Uncertainty Has Settled (2017) is a documentary about climate, energy and agriculture.

It was written by Malcolm Nance, a former cryptology analyst, with a foreword by Richard Engel. Its thesis is that ISIS is not part of Islam, instead, it functions as a separate destructive extremist group. He emphasizes the fact that the majority of those who have been harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement back to the history of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and it also discusses ISIS's combat style and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four- point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states. Defeating ISIS made The New York Times Best Seller list at number nine for the week of July 3, 2016 in the section for \\"E-Book Nonfiction\\". U.S. President Donald Trump stated he read Defeating ISIS while he was a candidate for president in 2016. U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations retired Colonel Millard E. Moon reviewed the book for Journal of Strategic Security, and wrote, \\"This book is a good reference source for anyone in the professional field and for individuals seeking to understand the enemy and what we and our allies face.\\" Current Affairs reviewed the book and called the work, \\"One of the more intelligent, incisive mass-market books on ISIS\\". The Australian gave the work a negative review. Spencer Ackerman said Nance's books The Terrorists of Iraq and Defeating ISIS reflected the caliber of his expertise in the subject matter. ==Contents summary== Defeating ISIS argues that the group ISIS does not belong to the faith of Islam, and should instead be thought of as a separate destructive extremist group. The work is organized into four sections. The author provides historical context for the evolution of ISIS over time. The book emphasizes that the majority of ISIS's victims are Muslim. He argues that ISIS is attempting to annihilate Islam itself, and instead replace it with its own more inhumane practices. Nance ties the history of ISIS back to changing developments within Al-Qaeda. Nance ascribes growth of influence by ISIS directly to problems within U.S. leadership related to combating Al-Qaeda in Iraq. He provides an overview of ISIS management, soldiers, and command format. Defeating ISIS provides geographic descriptions of ISIS centers of influence globally, including Mali, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, and Jordan. Nance discusses cultural differences within each locality. He details the practices of Boko Haram. He describes the Western influence of ISIS into countries including France, the U.S., Australia, and Turkey. He recounts the November 2015 Paris attacks and response to the incident. He provides the reader with a basis of ISIS operations within countries in Asia, states in the region of the Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The book describes the terrorist group's attempts to remake the world through jihad. Nance grounds the reader within the context of Islamic history, including the Battle of Nahrawan, controversy regarding Shia‚ÄìSunni relations, evolution of the Qarmatians, and the Mahdist War. Defeating ISIS details tactics of ISIS manipulation including psychological manipulation, behavior modification, and brainwashing. Nance writes that these strategies lead to gross violations of human rights, including sexual assault and child soldiers. Defeating ISIS describes ISIS combat tactics, with analysis of their armaments. Nance writes that ISIS usually engages in the military tactics of mountain warfare and frontal assault, later encouraging each other through social media discussing their combat operations. Defeating ISIS concludes with a strategy proposed by the author to weaken the organization both their combat operations and their ability to garner new followers. Nance lays forth a four-point plan, including: combat strategy with increased incorporation of airpower and special forces units, tactics to combat ISIS over the Internet, revitalization of the Syrian Armed Forces, and enlisting increased support from Arab world countries. ==Research and release== Malcolm Nance, author of Defeating ISIS Malcolm Nance is a retired cryptology analyst. He garnered expertise within the field of intelligence analysis. Nance served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, from 1981‚Äì2001. He devoted years researching Middle East terrorism. Nance founded a company providing advice to U.S. Special Operations, and created a survival tactics training center. He manages a think tank consisting of CIA and counterterrorism officers. His books on intelligence include An End to al-Qaeda, Terrorist Recognition Handbook, The Terrorists of Iraq, The Plot to Hack America, and Hacking ISIS. Prior to his work on Defeating ISIS, Nance had already extensively researched the topic, while writing a treatise specifically geared for the intelligence community to educate them in textbook format on the growth over time of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Defeating ISIS was contracted for publication with Skyhorse Publishing in November 2015, originally slated for a January 2017 release date. Defeating ISIS was published in 2016 by Skyhorse Publishing in print format. An e-book was published the same year. It went through two more editions in 2016. W. W. Norton & Company published another edition in 2017. Defeating ISIS made The New York Times Best Seller list at number nine for the week of July 3, 2016, in the section for \\"E-Book Nonfiction\\". U.S. President Donald Trump told Time magazine he read Defeating ISIS while he was a candidate for president in July 2016. ==Reception== U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations retired Colonel Millard E. Moon reviewed the book for Journal of Strategic Security, and wrote, \\"Nance offers a compelling argument to support the concept of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as a cult set apart from the Islamic religion.\\" Moon said that, \\"Nance has done a really good job of providing detailed information about the growth and activities of ISIS components\\". He praised the author's ability to structure the book as a reference resource, writing, \\"there is a wealth of factual information on ISIS\\". As for the religious nature of the organization, Moon acknowledged, \\"Malcolm Nance does an excellent job of outlining what ISIS believes\\". Moon concluded, \\"This book is a good reference source for anyone in the professional field and for individuals seeking to understand the enemy and what we and our allies face.\\" Current Affairs journalist Adam Patterson called the book \\"One of the more intelligent, incisive mass-market books on ISIS.\\" Patterson emphasized, \\"The central value of Nance‚Äôs work is ultimately written into its title. Defeating ISIS outlines that the jihadi group can, with intelligent application of diplomatic and counterinsurgency methods, be eventually defeated.\\" Rachel Maddow referenced this book as a source she used to educate herself about ISIS. The book received a negative review by Paul Monk in The Australian. Monk criticized the writing style, and disputed Nance's view that ISIS wished \\"to destroy Islam\\".

Ball meant that the gardens would be accessible to the public, and he gave them to the temporary Luogotenenti (lieutenants) who were responsible for the administration of the casali. The Luogotenenti did not open the gardens to the public but kept them for their own use, and the gardens subsequently became known as Il-ƒ†onna tal-Kmand, which means \\"Commander's Garden\\" in Maltese. The gardens were meant to increase the greenery around the Maltese Islands. They were also used for agricultural experimentation, and this resulted in the introduction of the potato crop which yielded greater revenue than cotton, Malta's primary agricultural export at the time. Ball also meant the gardens be used to freely provide farmers with seeds and shrubs, but this was not done and the gardens were not always well-maintained since the Luogotenenti were inexperienced with agricultural improvement. Several architects were involved in the design and construction of the gardens, including the cousins Antonio and Michele Cachia, and the layout is influenced by 18th-century Italian gardens. Each garden was surrounded by high boundary walls, and they had stone pathways flanked with pillars. Stone water conduits were built for irrigation. Most of them also had some service rooms which incorporated pigeon holes. The entrances of some of the gardens were decorated with a relief of the royal cypher of King George III, and they also had an inscription which read as follows: The inscription from the ≈ªabbar garden Some of the gardens were destroyed over the years, but the ones at Attard, Balzan, Gƒßargƒßur, Gudja, Lija, Mosta, Qrendi, Safi, Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, ≈ªebbuƒ° and ≈ªejtun still survive today, in different states of preservation. All of them are government-owned, and some are leased to private individuals while others are maintained by the local councils. Eight gardens, together with the remains of the ≈ªabbar garden, were scheduled as Grade 1 national monuments by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in 2009, while the remaining three gardens were scheduled in 2010. The remains of the Gƒßaxaq garden were scheduled as a Grade 2 property in 2013. The gardens of Gudja, Safi, Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, ≈ªebbuƒ° and ≈ªejtun are also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. ==Surviving gardens== Attard Il-ƒ†nien tal-Kmand in Attard The garden at Attard is located at Triq Hannibal (Hannibal Street).

It has been a Grade 1 property since 2010. Gƒßargƒßur The garden at Gƒßargƒßur is located at the aptly-named Triq il-ƒ†nien (Garden Street). The garden includes a building which served as the house of the Luogotenente. The building was designed by Antonio Cachia in 1803. A commemorative plaque, with Italian words making reference to King George III, and a sculpture made to sculpt for British insignia (but never completed) are located above the main entrance. The house and garden are leased to private individuals and are not accessible to the public.

This garden has been partially built up as the Plant Biotechnology Centre and its laboratories. It has reservoirs which feed into the nearby San Anton Palace. It is open to the public during occasions or by appointment as ƒ†nien il-Pjanti Maltin (Maltese Plants Garden). Mosta Il-ƒ†nien tal-Kmand in Mosta The garden at Mosta is located at Triq il-Kbira (Main Street). it is now scheduled at Grade 1. Qrendi The garden at Qrendi is located at the corner of Triq Santa Katerina (St. Catherine Street) and Triq Dwardu Borg (Dwardu Borg Street). The entrance contains an inscription, but no royal cypher. It is the largest of the surviving gardens, and it is subdivided into two parts, a small enclosed garden and a large field at the back. It contains orange, olive, lemon, pear, pomegranate, fig, medlar and plum trees, along with prickly pears. A reservoir is also found within the garden. The garden is now known as the Barn Owl‚Äôs Garden. At one point, there were plans to build a house for the elderly on the site of the field that forms part of the garden, but the plans were refused. Safi Inside Sir Alexander Ball's Garden in Safi The garden at Safi is located at Triq ta' ƒ†awhar (Ta' ƒ†awhar Street). The entrance of the garden consists of a portal flanked by two window-like depressions in the wall. The garden is open to the public, and it is known as Sir Alexander Ball's Garden (). Siƒ°ƒ°iewi The garden at Siƒ°ƒ°iewi is located at Triq Lapsi (Lapsi Street). The entrance of the garden consists of a portal flanked by two window-like depressions in the wall. ≈ªebbuƒ° The portal with the unfinished emblem.

The entrance is embellished with the royal cypher and an inscription. The garden was designed by Michele Cachia. Today, the ≈ªejtun garden is well-maintained, and it is open to the public as Luqa Briffa Garden (). ==Destroyed gardens== Misraƒß is-Sliem, site of the ≈ªabbar garden. The house of the commandant still exists (centre). The garden at Gƒßaxaq has been largely built up, although some parts of it are still in existence, and can be seen from Triq San Filippu (St. Philip Street). The garden at ≈ªabbar was located at present-day Misraƒß is-Sliem (Peace Square). The garden's inscription, which is identical to that found at other gardens, still survives and it is affixed onto the fa√ßade of a house in this square. The garden at Naxxar was located at the rear of Palazzo Nasciaro, which might have served as the residence of the Luogotenente. This garden has been built up as various houses. Gardens at Lija, Luqa, Mqabba, Qormi and ≈ªurrieq were destroyed in the 20th century to make way for housing, schools or other buildings. ==References== Category:Gardens in Malta Category:Attard Category:Balzan Category:Gƒßargƒßur Category:Gudja Category:Lija Category:Mosta Category:Qrendi Category:Safi, Malta Category:Siƒ°ƒ°iewi Category:≈ªebbuƒ° Category:≈ªejtun Category:19th-century establishments in Malta ","title":"ƒ†onna tal-Kmand"},{"id":"54256599","text":"Af Urur is a village in the Puntland region of Somalia, located on the Golis Mountains approximately 60 miles southwest of Bosaso.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aldershot since June 2017. Prior to being elected as an MP he served in the Scots Guards, before working in publishing and for the Conservative Party. He is the author of Desert of Death (2007). ==Early life and career== Docherty was born in Glasgow and grew up in Gloucestershire. He went on to study Swahili and Hindi at the University of London between 1996‚Äì2000, before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst the following year. From 2001 to 2007 he served in the Scots Guards. After being posted to London on ceremonial duties and a period spent in Germany, he served operationally in Iraq and Afghanistan as a British Army officer. After leaving the army, he wrote the book 'Desert of Death', which was published by Faber in 2007. The book consisted of a critical first-hand account of the current war in Afghanistan. Living in Didcot in Oxfordshire, he created and worked as editor and publisher of Steppe magazine - a now defunct publication that covered the arts, culture, history, landscape and people of Central Asia. He was appointed Director of the Conservative Middle East Council in 2010, a role in which he served until being elected as an MP. Docherty stood successfully as the Conservative candidate in the Hagbourne ward of South Oxfordshire District Council in May 2011, standing down at the end of his four-year term when the wards were revised. He stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate in the Wallingford division of Oxfordshire County Council in May 2017. ==Parliamentary career== Docherty in 2017 Docherty unsuccessfully applied to be the Conservative Party candidate for the Labour Party held Oxford East constituency in 2014. He was instead chosen to contest the safe Labour Party held seat of Caerphilly in the 2015 general election, where he came third. In 2017, he was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for Aldershot, after the incumbent Conservative MP Gerald Howarth announced he was standing down at the next general election. The Financial Times called his selection \\"the highest-profile tussle over a candidate choice, [in which] the party leadership rejected a request from activists in Aldershot to be allowed to consider Daniel Hannan, the prominent Eurosceptic MEP, for the safe Tory seat\\". He was duly elected at the 2017 general election. In the House of Commons he sits on the Defence Committee and Committees on Arms Export Controls (formerly Quadripartite Committee). He backed Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election. On 29 July 2019, Johnson appointed Docherty as an Assistant Government Whip. In 2019, Leo's brother Paddy Docherty wrote a letter to the Guardian urging him to resign, writing \\"Now I am simply appalled that this government, of which you are sadly a part, has become the principal threat to the lives and liberties of the people. Please do the decent thing, and resign.\\" Gulf States In the six months after being elected as an MP, Docherty registered four trips to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, costing over ¬£15,000 and paid for by the Governments of the host countries. Prior to this, his election campaign had benefited from donations totalling over ¬£10,000 from donors with links to the Gulf States. As Chair of the Conservative Middle East Council and since serving as an MP, Docherty has frequently praised the work of the governments in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and has been subject to some criticism from opposition MPs and journalists, such as Peter Oborne for his links and his failure to always declare his register of interests when speaking on the subject in Parliament. However, he has denied any conflict of interest and, as Director of the Conservative Middle East Council, responded to criticism of donations received there as not having influenced decision-making within the group.

Eric of Lorraine (14 March 1576 ‚Äì 27 April 1623), count of Vaud√©mont, was a Bishop of Verdun and half brother of Louise of Lorraine, Queen consort of France. ==Biography== Eric of Lorraine was born in Nancy on 14 March 1576 as a son of Nicolas, Duke of Merc≈ìur and his third wife Catherine of Lorraine (1550‚Äì1606), daughter of Claude, Duke of Aumale. Some sources attribute a turbulent youth to him, which did not prevent him from being destined for a career in the Church; he was provided with the Abbey of St. Hydulphe at Moyenmoutier on 31 March 1588. He was also the commendatory abbot of the Monastery of St Vanne near Verdun. He was appointed bishop of Verdun in 1593 when he was only seventeen years of age. By the end of the 16th century, with the religious world across western Europe undergoing the confrontation between the Protestant winds from Germany and the Counter-Reformation forces confronting them, there was a feeling that monasticism in Moyenmoutier had fallen into a sorry state. Eric undertook to restore a more orderly existence to the monks under his authority. He entrusted this task to Dom Didier de La Cour. In 1604 the resulting new constitution of the Congregation of St. Vanne and St. Hydulphe received Pope Clement VII's approval. The reforms became an important element in Catholic reform, being copied by other Catholic religious houses and congregations, most famously, in 1621, the Congregation of St. Maur. In the following year he considered becoming a Jesuit. He went to Rome, but the Pope dissuaded him from this idea. He returned to Verdun in 1597 and, encouraged by Cardinal Bellarmine, showed himself a model bishop: he organized synods and played an important part in the reform of the Benedictine orders in Lorraine. However, in 1605 he was involved in a scandal. He fell in love with and married a woman called Marie Dupuy (died 1640geanet.org Eric de LORRAINE, Retrieved on 10 June 2017). Eric was suspended on 19 December 1605 and subsequently brought before the tribunal of the Inquisition. As punishment he was relegated to the Jesuits of Pont-√†-Mousson. In his defense, he alleged that he was bewitched. As a result, Eric was exorcised before being re-established in his diocese in 1608. In 1610, he renounced his office as bishop of Verdun in favor of his nephew Charles,Saive Numismatique and retreated to the Capuchins. He died in Nancy in 1623.

Released theatrically on August 1, 1970, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== Hi-Rise Wise Guys begin with the title character, Woody Woodpecker (voiced by Grace Stafford), sleeping on a treetop until he is disturbed by the sound of a jackhammer. Unable to fall back asleep, Woody Woodpecker leaves his tree-home, discovering outside a high-rise skyscraper is being built upon where he lives, by a construction worker named Jack Hammer (voiced by Dallas McKennon). Woody resists the attempts of Jack Hammer to remove him from the site, and then asks what kind of accidents can happen on the building site; Jack then responds by attacking Woody with his Jackhammer. Woody falls down in the sand and Hammer quickly goes to see if he has injured Woody. Jack Hammer's boss asks him via Telephone to quickly build the skyscraper. As Hammer tries to pull a cement-filled wheelbarrow vertically with a rope, Woody cuts the rope with a knife, and Jack Hammer falls into the cement. As he chases Woody, the cement hardens with him inside. Woody frees the foreman, but Hammer insists that he fell in the cement on purpose. The telephone rings again, and the boss advises Hammer to continue with work. Once again, Woody stalls Jack's progress by entering the elevator before him, declaring that the elevator only has the capacity for one passenger. Hammer then orders the elevator to go down, only to be crushed by it. Woody changes the accidents-on-the-job sign to say Hammer was crushed, but Hammer comes back and says he was \\"clobbering around\\". In the final scene, Woody is seen at the top of the building. Hammer grabs Woody by the neck as the woodpecker attempts to change the accident sign. He accuses Woody of doing this deliberately; Jack grabs a piece of concrete to throw at Woody, but his throw misses and hits a steel girder of the skyscraper, causing it to become unbalanced. The structure collapses, and Hammer begins to burst into tears. Woody can't stand to see this and makes a deal with the Hammer; while Jack rebuilds the skyscraper, Woody sleeps peacefully in his tree, enclosed in a giant plastic bubble muffling the noise. ==References External links == * Golden Age Cartoons - The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia - 1970 * http://goldenagecartoons.com links to Facebook page.

The origins of the gens Neratia lie in the Italian town of Saepinum in the heart of Samnium. The name of Pansa's father, beyond the gentilicum Neratius, is not known, although experts agree that Lucius Neratius Priscus was his brother. Experts also believe Pansa acquired the name elements \\"Marcus Hirrius\\" from his adoptive father, a member of the gens Hirrii; this adoption occurred before the creation of the earliest surviving inscription bearing his name.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 117 == Career == Pansa's career in the emperor's service is not fully recorded.

Hirrius Fronto Neratius Pansa\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 58 (1968), pp. 170-175 Then, after his consulship, Pansa was assigned in 74/75 to administer a census in a place called regio X: Mario Torelli believed this referred to a portion of the province of Cappadocia, which was at the time being organized; however, the editors of L'Annee Epigraphique note that it could also refer to Regio X Venetia et Histria in Roman Italy, where the Hirrii originated. This was followed with a commission to conduct a campaign against an enemy most of whose name was lost from the inscription except the initial letter A: either Pansa campaigned in Armenia Major, or against the Alans. This campaign was carried out in 75 or 76. He was victorious in his military tasks, for the inscription attests Pansa received dona militaria or military honors, including the mural crown and camp crown. Either with his accession to the suffect consul, or between the completion of his campaign in the East and his next assignment as governor, Pansa was co-opted into the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis. It is clear that following his campaign he served as curator aedium sacrarum, either before he served as governor, or after.

Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 4QJerc (4Q72; 1st century BC),\\"The Evolution of a Theory of the Local Texts\\" in Cross, F.M.; Talmon, S. (eds) (1975) Qumran and the History of Biblical Text (Cambridge, MA - London). p.308 n. 8 with extant verses 1‚Äë3, 13‚Äë15 (similar to Masoretic Text). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (with a different chapter and verse numbering), made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==Parashot== The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As reflected in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English.

Born in 1931 near Punta Arenas, Chile, she grew up on a sheep farm in Argentina. Enamored of speed at an early age, she rode a horse called Blitz (German for \\"lightning\\"). Watching Fangio driving by the ranch in his racing car led to her involvement with racing cars.

In 1963, she and her husband immigrated to the United States, where they established an automotive business, Delfosse Racing, in San Diego, and another in Idyllwild. Retiring in 1977, they moved to southern Oregon and built a home along the Little Applegate River. Facing economic problems after the buyer of their California business defaulted on payments, they sold their home and moved to Ashland where they leased and operated a gas station near Interstate 5. Both died of lung problems associated with frequent exposure to leaded gasoline, asbestos from brake pads, and other toxins that posed risks to race-car mechanics and drivers in the mid-20th century.

(), stylized as beme, was a multimedia company founded by Matt Hackett and Casey Neistat, a vlogger and short film maker on YouTube. Beme Inc. was the creator of the mobile app Beme. On November 28, 2016, CNN announced that it would acquire Beme. CNN intended to invest in the company and create a new brand focused on a young audience. The Beme app was officially shut down on January 31, 2017. Beme was merged into CNN Digital Studios on January 25, 2018. Despite this, the Beme News YouTube channel was still active for more than a year after the closure. ==History== In 2014, Beme Inc. was founded by Matt Hackett and Casey Neistat. On July 17, 2015, Beme Inc. released a mobile app called Beme on the iOS App Store. The app enables users to produce unedited 2-to-8-second videos, which are immediately uploaded and shared with the user's subscribers, without the ability to preview the video. On July 28, 2015, Casey Neistat confirmed a US$2.6M seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and VaynerRSE. On May 2, 2016, Beme was released for Android on the Google Play Store. At TechCrunch, in May 2016, Neistat informed that they had raised a total of US$6M and had 11 full-time employees (10 technical, 1 responsible for social media). He also reported that burn rate was under around US $180k per month and that his salary was US$0.

He attended Trinity High School in Rutherglen. == Political career == Killen joined the Labour Party in 2007. He was a candidate at the 2012 South Lanarkshire Council election. Following the death of Cllr Anne Higgins, he contested the 2013 Rutherglen South ward by-election and was elected to South Lanarkshire Council aged 26. Killen retained his council seat at the 2017 UK local elections, this time in the Rutherglen Central and North ward. Killen won the Rutherglen and Hamilton West at the 2017 general election, achieving a narrow majority of 265 votes over the sitting Scottish National Party MP, Margaret Ferrier. He made his maiden speech on 27 June 2017. On 13 June 2018, Killen and five other Labour MPs resigned their roles as frontbenchers for the Labour Party in protest at Labour's position on Brexit. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn had instructed his MPs to abstain in a vote which the UK would remain in the single market by joining the European Economic Area (EEA). The MPs resigned and voted in favour of the EEA. At the 2019 general election, Ferrier regained the seat from Killen with a majority of 5,230 votes. During his short time as an MP, Killen was an active campaigner for LGBT rights issues, men's mental health and banking reform. In September 2020, Killen called for Richard Leonard to resign as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party despite nominating him in the 2017 leadership election, saying he had since changed from supporting Leonard's leadership due to deep worries of grassroots members. == Personal life == Killen is gay, and married his husband Peter when they eloped in 2013. They hope to retire to Peter's hometown in Northern Ireland, which has influenced Killen's campaigning to equalise same-sex marriage laws between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Killen is a Roman Catholic. == References External links== * * Category:Living people Category:People from Rutherglen Category:People educated at Trinity High School, Rutherglen Category:Scottish Roman Catholics Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Category:LGBT politicians from Scotland Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:Scottish Labour Party councillors Category:1986 births Category:Politicians from South Lanarkshire ","title":"Ged Killen"},{"id":"54257602","text":"Corbin Brian Burnes (born October 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). ==Career== Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Sheffield Hallam from 2017 to 2019, and was elected as the Labour candidate. After joining Parliament, O'Mara became a member of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, but resigned in October 2017, following the publication of offensive comments about women and gay men that he had made in 2009 and earlier. O'Mara was suspended from the Labour Party on 25 October 2017, following further reports of online comments made before his election that have been described as racist, homophobic and misogynistic. It was stated that O'Mara was reinstated in the Labour Party in July 2018, a claim he denied. He subsequently sat as an independent MP. On 27 July 2019, O'Mara announced that he would resign as a Member of Parliament in September 2019, after the summer recess. Three weeks later, it was announced that O'Mara had been arrested on suspicion of fraud. == Early life and education == O'Mara was born in Sheffield. He has cerebral palsy, hemiparesis and is on the autism spectrum. He was educated at Tapton School, in the city's Crosspool suburb, and graduated from Staffordshire University with a first class honours degree in Journalism. Before entering politics, he was a local school governor and had volunteered for Sheffield-based disability information services and charities. With friends, he ran West Street Live, a bar and music venue in Sheffield. O'Mara had stood as a Labour candidate in various Sheffield council elections. He supported Jeremy Corbyn's election as Leader of the Labour Party in 2015 and 2016, was a Momentum supporter and was backed by them during the 2017 election. == Parliamentary career == In the 2017 general election, O'Mara contested the constituency of Sheffield Hallam, held by Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat leader and former Deputy Prime Minister. He was selected in an emergency selection process for the snap election under the control of the National Executive Committee and regional boards, rather than by the local constituency party. His campaign benefited from a national surge in the Labour vote and from university students in the constituency. It has been claimed that Clegg was thought to be too anti-Brexit by voters, although Sheffield Hallam was estimated to have voted Remain in the 2016 European Union Referendum, and O'Mara supports Remain as well. O'Mara's campaign focused on disabled people's rights, protecting public services and on his personal background in Sheffield. He won the seat with a majority of 2,125 votes, overturning Clegg's previous majority of 2,353 votes. The result was considered one of the most important seat changes of the night; O'Mara had not expected to win the seat. His acceptance speech called for politicians to do more to stand up for disabled people. Given his disability, the buildings of the House of Commons presented problems for O'Mara as the terms of the Equality Act 2010 are yet to be met. In June 2017, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, allowed MPs not to wear ties in the House of Commons, a decision partly made because O'Mara's cerebral palsy makes it difficult for him to do up and wear a tie. O'Mara said that he would not have run for election had he known these difficulties before becoming an MP. O'Mara supported a zero-tolerance policy on shouting and heckling, saying that he could not attend Prime Minister's Questions because of his anxiety triggered by aggression in the chamber. O'Mara also supported exempting members from interventions during speeches, introducing proxy voting and allowing MPs to make speeches to the House of Commons via online video-stream. O'Mara advocated a second referendum on Brexit and campaigned against fracking. O'Mara asked his first written question in October 2017. O'Mara never asked an oral question, and made his maiden speech on 24 July 2018, the day before the start of the summer recess. He was the 84th and final MP of the 2017 intake to make a maiden speech; the 83rd, David Duguid, spoke in November 2017.  Labour whip suspension over online comments  O'Mara became a member of the Women and Equalities Select Committee in September 2017. Following revelations of offensive comments he had made before becoming an MP, he resigned from the committee the following month. A series of derogatory comments about women and gay men posted by O'Mara on websites over a decade before he became an MP were revealed by the Guido Fawkes site on 23 October 2017. He commented about the Girls Aloud pop group: \\"I advise you to sack Sarah and the remaining four members (Nicola, Cheryl, Nadine and Kimberley) come have an orgy with me\\"; and he said that the 2003 winner of Pop Idol, Michelle McManus, had \\"only won because she was fat\\". He has also been accused of making homophobic comments including referring to gay men as \\"poofters\\" and \\"fudge packers\\" and referring to jazz musician Jamie Cullum as a \\"conceited cunt\\" who should be \\"sodomised with his own piano\\". O'Mara apologised \\"if his comments caused offence\\" and resigned from the Women and Equalities Select Committee. In a later speech, O'Mara said that the homophobic words he used were part of an Eminem record he listened to at the time. The following day, O'Mara was accused by Sophie Evans, a Sheffield bar worker whom he had met through an online dating app, on BBC Two's Daily Politics of having \\"made transphobic slurs\\" towards her in March 2017, and of saying in the same incident that she was an \\"ugly bitch\\". O'Mara denied the allegation. On the same day, it also emerged that he had been posting derogatory comments about children in Sheffield and appeared to advocate corporal punishment to deal with delinquent youth. Following the emergence of the comments to Evans, the Labour Party announced an investigation into O'Mara's conduct but stopped short of suspending him from the party. Further revelations were made public on 25 October 2017. On a Morrissey fan site in 2002, he was found to have made xenophobic insults, saying that Danes were \\"pig shaggers\\" who \\"practised bestiality\\" and referring to Spaniards as \\"dagos\\". O'Mara, when reviewing the Arctic Monkeys in November 2004, made several sexual comments including how \\"sexy little slags\\" danced to the band's songs. These revelations resulted in O'Mara being suspended from the Labour Party and therefore having the party whip withdrawn. It was reported on 15 January 2018 that O'Mara had not spoken publicly in his constituency since his apology on 23 October. After the party whip was suspended, he cancelled his constituency surgery. In December 2017, a press statement explained that his leave was on the advice of his GP, who had discouraged him from attending Parliament, although O'Mara continued to deal with his constituents' casework. After three months' absence, O'Mara returned to the House of Commons on 17 January 2018 and voted on the report stage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.  Reinstatement and resignation from Labour Party  On 3 July 2018, it was announced that O'Mara would be readmitted to the Labour Party, following a review by its National Executive Committee disputes panel. This review had decided to issue O'Mara a formal warning with a mandatory requirement to attend training, rather than refer the issue to the National Constitutional Committee which has the power to expel members. The decision was criticised by local Liberal Democrats, the closest challengers to Labour in Sheffield Hallam. In a statement in July 2019, O'Mara said that he had never been reinstated to the party. In an interview with ITV following his readmission, O'Mara said that he had made three attempts on his life during his suspension and had developed an anxiety disorder. He also said that he is on the autism spectrum, and believes that he is the first autistic MP in history. O'Mara restated his apology and asked for forgiveness from his constituents and the country. He refused to call a by-election and promised to make his maiden speech in July 2018, which he did. On 12 July 2018, O'Mara announced his resignation from the Labour Party. He said that he had \\"not been listened to or given a fair investigation\\" following his suspension, and that the party \\"no longer shares [his] commitment to the true definition of equality and compassion.\\" Offering to help constituents with casework, he suggested that he would not step down as an MP. Despite his resignation, the Labour Party affirmed that it would continue to provide support for O'Mara; this was on the orders of Corbyn, who was concerned for O'Mara's welfare. In October 2018, O'Mara said that the Labour Party had only made one adjustment for him, namely moving his office closer to the Commons chamber. In July 2019, he said that Corbyn had made \\"false reports about me being a mental health danger around parliament\\" after O'Mara had complained about not being able to arrange a meeting with the former's office. On 18 July 2018, O'Mara announced that he would step back from his parliamentary duties on the advice of his GP. This coincided with a series of crucial votes on the Brexit negotiations, for which reason O'Mara had unsuccessfully applied to vote by proxy. In March 2019, O'Mara was absent for another series of key Brexit votes, having suffered an injury in the shower. After facing calls from his constituents to resign, O'Mara likened them to \\"a hooligan on the terraces threatening the referee whilst drinking flat lager and smelling of processed meats.\\" On 24 April 2019, O'Mara suspended constituents' casework for a month, pending the recruitment of new staff and a move to a new constituency office. It was reported that O'Mara no longer has any staff working for him, as all his staff have either resigned or been fired.  Retirement from the House of Commons  In early July 2019, O'Mara said that he would stand for re-election at the next general election. On 23 July 2019, Gareth Arnold, a member of O'Mara's communications team, took to the latter's Twitter account to publicly resign and voice his concerns about the MP. Arnold said that O'Mara was \\"the most disgustingly morally bankrupt person [he had] ever had the displeasure of working with\\" and had shown \\"inexcusable contempt\\" for his constituents. He told O'Mara to call a by-election. On 25 July 2019, O'Mara released a public statement, apologising \\"to everybody for everything\\". He said that he had been \\"bullied and mistreated\\" and \\"wasn't even meant to win the election\\", having received no support from the national party for his campaign. He said that he would be \\"taking time out to...deal with my mental health and personal issues regarding self-medication\\". An investigation by the BBC revealed that Arnold was still working for O'Mara two weeks following his resignation, having \\"extended his notice period\\", and that staff hired in O'Mara's office had not received the security clearance required by parliamentary authorities. On 27 July 2019 it was reported that O'Mara had sexually harassed a 20-year-old employee. O'Mara had sent WhatsApp messages to the employee, often late at night, in which he revealed his love for her, calling her \\"an angel\\", \\"a delicate little flower\\" and \\"effortlessly pretty\\". In a separate message to his constituency staff, O'Mara accused the Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate for his seat of believing in eugenics, and claimed that she had repressed sexual feelings for him. Later that day, he announced that he would be standing down as an MP in September 2019, after Parliament's summer recess. In mid-August 2019, it was reported that O'Mara and Arnold had been arrested on suspicion of fraud, but were released a day later subject to further investigation. Arnold had allegedly referred O'Mara to the police in July 2019 over his expenses, after which the police raided O'Mara's office, seizing documents and computers. On 3 September 2019, O‚ÄôMara announced that he had postponed his application to resign from the House of Commons. On 4 October 2019, one of O'Mara's constituents made a formal complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, alleging O'Mara had failed to act in the public interest and had used public money for his own benefit, and calling for a full investigation into his affairs. O'Mara voted for the \\"Letwin amendment\\" and against the government during the special sitting of Parliament on 19 October 2019. He did not stand again in the December 2019 general election and was succeeded as MP for Sheffield Hallam by Olivia Blake.\\"General election 2019: Jared O'Mara will not defend Sheffield Hallam seat\\", BBC News, 14 November 2019.

She was the Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights in Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet. In the 2019 parliamentary election, she lost her seat to the Conservative Richard Holden, who won the constituency with a majority of 1,144. ==Early life and career== Pidcock was born in North Shields, North Tyneside and raised in New Hartley and Seaton Delaval, Northumberland. Her parents were both active in politics. Her mother Mary was a social worker while her father Bernard was an office managerBernard Pidock , Companies House. Retrieved 7 April 2018. who sat on Northumberland County Council from 2008 until his death in February 2019.Councillor Bernard Pidcock , Northumberland County Council. Retrieved 7 April 2018. Aged just 3, Pidcock recollects attending demonstrations with her parents against then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and against the apartheid system in South Africa. Pidcock has stated, \\"From a very, very young age I was taught to see everything through a political lens and through a class lens\\", and that at school she was known as \\"the political one\\" and a \\"swot\\". She studied politics at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was a mental health support worker before working within, then managing, the education team at anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card. She completed an MSc in Disaster Management and Sustainable Development at Northumbria University in 2012, with research focusing on children's institutions in Bulgaria. Pidcock was a councillor for Cramlington Eastfield ward on Northumberland County Council, losing her seat to the Conservative Party candidate in the 2017 UK local elections. In 2020 she led Richard Burgon's unsuccessful campaign to be deputy leader of the Labour Party. == Parliamentary career == Only weeks prior to the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Pidcock was selected to stand for Labour in North West Durham, when the previous MP, Pat Glass stood down. A feminist, she said in her maiden speech, that the Palace of Westminster dated from \\"a time when my class and my sex would have been denied a place in it, because we are deemed unworthy\\". Her speech was shared over 200,000 times on social media in 48 hours. On 12 January 2018, she was appointed Shadow Minister for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and announced at the 2019 TUC that the next Labour Government would create a Ministry for Employment Rights to \\"bring about the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen\\" to deliver better wages, greater security and give workers more of a say over how their workplaces are run. Although once tipped as a future party leader, Pidcock lost her seat at the 2019 general election. Her successor, Richard Holden stated in his acceptance speech that \\"she represented a branch of the Labour Party that wasn't mainstream, which wasn't what people thought of as traditional Labour and that's what happened tonight\\". It was the first time the seat had not returned a Labour MP since its creation in 1950. In July 2020 the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards told Pidcock to repay more than ¬£3,800 after she used Commons stationery to accuse the government of a \\"betrayal\\" over the BBC licence fee for over-75s. Pidcock had sent out more than 5,000 letters in September 2019 accusing the Conservatives of a \\"welfare cut\\". She said she used a template from a House of Commons department, but had made some changes. The Commissioner said these changes meant the letter \\"was no longer neutral and objective\\". Pidcock said it had been an \\"honest mistake\\". Views Pidcock identifies as a socialist, and supported the policies of party leader Jeremy Corbyn. A strong critic of the Conservative Party, she said that \\"I go to parliament to be a mouthpiece for my constituents and class\\". She stated in mid-2017 that Tories were \\"the enemy\\" and said she was \\"disgusted at the way they're running this country\\". Pidcock did not socialise with Conservative MPs and said that she had \\"absolutely no intention of being friends with any Tories.\\" Pidcock speaking at the Britain is Broken rally in 2019 In June 2017, Pidcock raised the issue of social housing, as it affected her personally: she said she would accept a council house, but there were none available. She also said that she was unable to afford the deposit for her first home, despite her MP's salary, because of university debt, so she was renting in the private sector. However, she managed to purchase a house jointly with her partner at a cost of ¬£230,000 three months later. She criticised the Conservative government for doing far too little for working-class people, and said that her then constituency had suffered long-term de-industrialisation and lack of investment, leading to significant financial difficulties for many residents. She highlighted the rise in volunteer organisations to help support people who have been left behind by the state. In December 2017, in a Parliamentary question to the Prime Minister, Theresa May, Pidcock condemned delays to payments under the Universal Credit system in the period just before Christmas, \\"the toughest financial time\\" for her constituents. She asked, \\"Is the roll-out a matter of gross incompetence or calculated cruelty?\\" She criticised the lack of proxy voting for pregnant women in Parliament, attending a vote in 2018 whilst in the late stages of pregnancy. Pidcock described climate change as the \\"biggest issue facing humanity\\", and spoke at School Strike for Climate demonstrations. ==Personal life== Pidcock's partner since 2015 is Daniel Kebede, a National Education Union official. They have one son, born in July 2018. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Councillors in Northumberland Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Alumni of Manchester Metropolitan University Category:People from Cramlington Category:English feminists Category:English socialists Category:Socialist feminists ","title":"Laura Pidcock"},{"id":"54257662","text":"Oakwood Park is an unincorporated community in Turkey Creek Township, Kosciusko County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== Oakwood Park is located on the shores of Lake Wawasee, at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kosciusko County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"Oakwood Park, Indiana"},{"id":"54257701","text":"Maternal Secrets is a female-led thriller television film, set in the island of Bermuda.

The most prevalent Luri dance styles are handkerchief dance, Chupi dances (SanguinSama; slow rhythm along with strike and fiddle, Se-Pa (three steps) dance that is performed faster than SanguinSama, and Du-Pa (Two steps) dance that is the fastest and the most exciting performance), and the stick dance (√áub√¢zi or Tarka-b√¢zi)(like Jitterbug wood) which is a martial show.Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages Harvesting ceremony dances, PaPoshtePa dances, Suwaruna and the mourning dances are of less popular dances. Mourning dances are performed while loved persons are died as Chamariuna among Feylis and also among Great Lur tribes (Bakhtiries and the Southern Lurs). Dasm√¢l- b√¢zi (Handkerchief dance) right Handkerchief dance also known as scarf dance (Luri:Dasm√¢l-b√¢zi) is a vibrant circle dance style. This dance style is more common among Southern Lurs and Bakhtiari people. This style is usually performed by both male and female persons and includes different performing styles like Ashtafi-mangan√¢. Men or women may dance and wave colorful scarves, called dastm√¢l. A dasm√¢l is held in each hand. In case of the philosophy, it is believed that these dances have originated in the actions the women do in their daily livelihood. As the dance rhythm increases slowly, each person may chooses patterns to perform.Bakhtiyari Dances, CD Number [174], Published [05/08/2004], Collected & Researched by: Mansureh Sabetzadeh, available online at: ƒåu-b√¢zi (Twig dance) ƒåu-b√¢zi or Chubazi (twig dance) is a special dance double that is performed in the celebrations and joys by Bakhtiari and the southern Lurs and is inspired by the heroic battles.Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages It is usually dance by two men, although sometimes is performed by the women too. One dancer (the defender) is equipped with a long heavy stick up to four or five feet long. The other (the attacker) whom holds a shorter flexible stick (tarka), has to attack the opponent only below the level of the knee. While the dance is accompanied by drum and karn√¢ (a horn music instrument), the defender is only allowed to escape the strike by leaping up in the air. The contributors change in turn till the protagaonists are specified.David Brooks, The enemy within: limitations on leadership in the Bakhtiari, in The Conflict of Tribes and State in Iran and Afghanistan, ed: Richard Tapper, London, 1983, pp 15-18. The dancers are surrounded by female and male enthusiastic audiences whom cheer the winners by screams and whistles. ƒåupi (Choupi) In Luri dialects, mass dance styles that are mainly based on leg movements are said ƒåupi (⁄ÜŸàŸàŸæ€å, Choupi). Mixed male and female dancers hold hands to form rings, hearing the vibrant musics by musicians, they perform different styles of ƒçupi. The leader performer (Sarƒçupi or ƒåupike≈°) is a skillful dancer whose duty is to lead others and warm up them in accordance with dance music rhythms. Other performers should coordinate the movements and body rhythms with the leader. The dance usually starts with Sangin-Sam√¢ rhythm which is performed slowly, following Sep√¢ (Three steps) the next rhythm with faster performing and soars when vibrant Dop√¢ (two steps) is performing. After a while, the dance concludes to Sangin- Sam√¢ movements in a reversed trend.⁄Ø⁄ò⁄©, ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸÜŸÖÿß€å ÿß€åŸÜÿ™ÿ±ŸÜÿ™€å ÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ± ŸÑÿ±. ŸÑÿ±€å (⁄ÜŸàŸæ€å)\\".¬ª .

Performers, initially put their right foot in the form of a cross with left foot, then take it and take two steps forward. Then they put the left foot with the tip of the toe and finally put it aside right foot. The hands bend from elbow and small fingers of dancers, in line with the shoulders, are tied among each other. It seems that each of the gestures and dance components of Sama, has a philosophy retrieved from thousands years of coexistence with humane and natural elements behind it.Mortezai Darikvand, Ali. \\"The Philosophy Behind the Luri Sam√¢ dance\\", Goftare M√¢, Information Agency, Tehran, 12 February 2016. Retrieved on 27 October 2016. Sep√¢ In ƒåupi dance continuum, the second phase is Sep√¢ (three steps) which is performed faster and more dynamic than Sangin-Sam√¢ in accordance with speeding up the music rhythm. Dancers start the dance with the right foot and take three steps forward. In Luri dances, like most Iranian group dances, the start of the move is with the right foot. After removing the three steps, the dancers first bend the right leg and then the left foot. The dancers' hands in this dance are tied to each other and their shoulders rely on each other. The literal meaning of dance in Luri (Dasgerta), is the bond between hands when dancing. ==References== Dance ","title":"Luri dances"},{"id":"54257727","text":"Annibale Grassi (1537‚Äì1590) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Apostolic Nuncio to Spain (1588‚Äì1590) and Bishop of Faenza (1575‚Äì1585).

He was granted a chair in Civil Law at the University, where he taught for fifteen years. He was summoned to Rome, where he was appointed Auditor [luogotenente] of Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza, who was Chamberlain [Camerlengo] of the Apostolic Camera (Finance Ministry) of the Holy Roman Church. Pope Pius V (1566‚Äì1572) named him Referendary of the Two Signatures. He was a member of the staff of Cardinal Michele Bonelli, the Pope's nephew, when he served as Legate to the Kings of Spain, Portugal, and France, in 1571 and 1572.Renazzi, II, p. 157. Messeri, p. 65, note, column 2. Pope Gregory XIII, a fellow Bolognese, named Annibale a Consultor of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, and Auditor ContradictorumRenazzi, p. 158. In a letter of 24 June 1575, Pope Gregory appointed Annibale Grassi to the recently vacated post of Rector of the Studium Generale Almae Urbis (the Sapienza), an office to be held for life.Renazzi, pp. 158, 269-271. The letter was registered in the record books of the Apostolic Camera on 4 July 1575. The Pope had plans for Grassi's continued service, and therefore he allowed him to have a coadjutor in the office of Rector, Grassi's own brother Cesare, who was Provost of the Cathedral Chapter of Bologna. Cesare Grassi resigned the post in 1581, due to ill health.Cesare Grassi was made a Canon of the Vatican Basilica and a Protonotary Apostolic. He rose to be Auditor of the Rota. Renazzi, p. 158. In the Consistory of 23 July 1575, Annibale Grassi was appointed Bishop of Faenza by Pope Gregory XIII (1572‚Äì1585). He took possession of the diocese through his Procurator, Canon Tommaso Pasi. On 13 December 1575, he made his solemn entry into his diocese. In 1576, to carry forward his predecessor's initiative, he obtained subsidies both from the city government and the Cathedral Chapter for the erection of a seminary. In May 1577, the Bishop united fifteen benefices to provide the seminary with a regular income.Messeri, p. 65, note, column 2; p. 66, note, column 1. Bishop Grassi's patron, Cardinal Sforza, who had been serving as Legate of the Marches, died on 16 May 1581, and Cardinal Guido Ferreri was appointed to succeed him. Bishop Grassi was named Vice-Legate. Before he left Faenza, however, he presided over the consecration of the new cathedral, on 15 October 1581. On 12 May 1582, the Vice-Legate had a seat of honor at the provincial synod of Ravenna. On 18 March 1585, Bishop Grassi resigned the diocese of Faenza in favor of his nephew, Gian Antonio Grassi.Resignation: Messeri, p. 66, note, column 1. Annibale returned to Rome, where the new pope, Sixtus V, named him Consultor at the Holy Office (Inquisition). In 1586, he was appointed Cleric of the Apostolic Camera, and Apostolic Visitor to Piceno.Later appointments: Messeri, p. 66, note, column 1. On 27 August 1588, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Spain by Pope Sixtus. He died in Madrid, where he was still serving as Nuncio, on 24 June 1590.Henry Biaudet (1910). Les nonciatures apostoliques permanentes jusqu'en 1648. Helsinki Suomalainen Tiedeakatemie. p. 268. It is said that he was cardinal-elect at the time of his death, that is to say that he would be named a cardinal at the next consistory. A red hat was a frequent reward for a successful nunciature. But Pope Sixtus died on 27 August 1590.

He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow North East and Shadow Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 2017 until he lost his seat to the SNP at the 2019 general election. ==Early life and education== Sweeney was born at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow on 16 January 1989 to Anne Patricia Sweeney (n√©e Doherty), a bank clerk and John Gordon Sweeney, a shipyard worker. He was brought up in Auchinairn, and Milton. Sweeney attended St. Matthew's Primary School and Turnbull High School in Bishopbriggs. The first and only member of his family to attend university, Sweeney studied at the University of Stirling, gaining a Certificate of Higher Education with Distinction in Economics and Political Science, before continuing his degree at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a first class MA (Hons) in Economic History and Political Science in 2011, achieving the prize for best joint honours performance in Economic History, including a research project on the post-war economic development of Yarrow Shipbuilders, the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.

After undertaking an internship with BAE Systems at Portsmouth Naval Base as an undergraduate, Sweeney joined the company's graduate development programme with BAE Systems Maritime ‚Äì Naval Ships in 2011, based at the Govan and Scotstoun shipyards on the Clyde, where he undertook a series of roles in production engineering and shipbuilding operations management on the Type 45 destroyer, Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier and Type 26 frigate programmes. Whilst at BAE Systems, Sweeney also initiated a project with the Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio to introduce virtual reality methods into complex warship design and construction.

She was born in Bratislava. She is of partially Hungarian origin on her father's side.Sz√©plaki, L (2017). \\"Personal interview with Dagmar Bruckmayerov√° (Osobn√© stretnutie s Dagmar Bruckmayerovou )\\" ==Biography== Early life and education After graduating from middle school in 1983, Bruckmayerov√° applied to a gymnasium in Kras≈àany. At the same time, she started attending the Ludus theatre, which was at that time still an amateur theatre targeted towards younger audiences, with performances of both national and foreign classics. Bruckmayerov√° got her first major role in 1985 in the play Fairytale by J√°n Buz√°ssy. Some of her fellow actors and colleagues would later become well-known actors, including Vladim√≠r Hajdu, Roman Lukn√°r, Andrej Kraus, Michal Guƒç√≠k, Peter Skl√°r, Elena Podz√°mska, Oƒæga Bele≈°ov√°, and others.Sz√©plaki, L (2017). Hereƒçka Dagmar Bruckmayerov√° (Research paper). Bratislava. Bruckmayerov√° first began studying acting at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (V≈†MU) in 1987 and graduated from the faculty of theatre in 1991. Some of her more better-known classmates include Roman Pomajbo, Peter Mankoveck√Ω, Roman Matisko, Zuzana Maur√©ry, and Henrieta Miƒçkovicov√°. During her academic years, the young actress performed in various theatre plays. She worked at the Slovak National Theatre (SND), the Pavol Orsz√°gh Hviezdoslav theatre (DPOH), the Mal√° sc√©na theatre, and Astorka Korzo '90 theatre. In 1988, she played the small role of Xenia, the daughter of Godunov, in a play inspired by Russian history ‚Äì Dmitry Samozvanets, by classic Slovak author J√°n Pal√°rik. She got a bigger role in the historical drama Herodes and Herodias, written by P. O. Hviezdoslav, and directed by Milo≈° Pietor. She also took on the role of Oscar Wilde's Salome, garnering positive reviews: \\"The convincing Dagmar Bajnokov√° performed in the premiere, achieving all that could be expected from a debuting student of acting.\\" The two most important moments in her early career, were roles in the plays Mein Kampf and The Bald Soprano. In Main Kampf, directed by Roman Pol√°k, she performed nude for several minutes: \\"‚Ä¶the only thing I was wearing was a hat Mr. Labuda gave me. My parents were in visible despair, they didn‚Äôt even want to attend the premiere at first. After the play, my brother told me that it was a damn good thing I at least had the hat.\\" Another positive review of her performance reads: \\"The Grete of Dagmar Bajnokov√° is a sinful, yet innocent child. She lets herself get caressed by Schlomo, while, with the same amount of enthusiasm and ignorance, whispering vulgar insults about the \\"International Jewery\\" into Hitler¬¥s ear. However, at the end of the play, she drastically learns that her game ends in tragedy.\\" Career After graduating from the academy, Bruckmayerov√° started working at the Korzo '90 theatre (now Astorka Korzo '90), but after director Juraj Vacul√≠k was removed from the post of artist in chief, she left the theatre alongside her coworker Rastislav Rogel. She then worked at Studio S theatre (now Studio L+S), where she performed in the comedy play Jacques and His Master, alongside J√∫lius Satinsk√Ω and Milan Lasica. Bruckmayerov√° also showed her talent in front of cameras by acting as an antagonist in various fairy tales for young children, until she was approached by director Ivan Petrovick√Ω with the role of a beautiful princess in the fable Princezn√° v je≈æovej ko≈æi (1994). With reference to the role, she has said: \\"I was fairly surprised when I heard I was going to play a princess‚Ä¶ I just couldn't imagine myself as a melancholic beauty. When I was first applying to V≈†MU, my brothers made fun of me, saying: 'Are you sure they will accept you? They only accept good-looking girls, you know...'\\" In the end, the fairy tale was well received in part due to Bruckmayerov√°'s performance. One of her co-stars was J√°n Kroner, in the role of the groomer J√°n. Another point of interest is the fact that the actress performed the role of the young princess not too long after giving birth to her daughter Tereza. She was forced to step down from public life due to familial responsibilities, which meant her voice could only be heard in dubbed television programs and movies in cinemas. She has said: \\"I don't pick the characters, but I love doing voiceovers for the ones which have an emotionally rich life. They bear their burden and have something they want to say. The psychology behind such characters is completely different. Trying to get into the role and feel just as the actress on screen does is very important to me and sometimes doing voiceovers for these characters even brings me to tears.\\" At the turn of the millennium, Bruckmayerov√° overcame martial and divorce- related issues, and this era also marked her return to performing. She worked for several years at the J√°n Pal√°rik theatre in Trnava and performed in various television series. Her most famous role from this period is that of Nina Hod√°kov√°, a morally corrupt entrepreneur from the television series Klan. Speaking about the role, she said, \\"I enjoy the ability to be annoying and rude for once. In real life, I constantly pay attention to my language and try not to offend anyone, even with a mere word.\\" In Trnava, she starred in many plays, including Poet and Woman, Mother Died Twice, Couples at stake, Roses from the Heart, and Handvaerkerne. On the stage of Theatre West, she acted in the comedies Non B√©b√© (renamed to Scam in the reopened premiere at the W√ºnstenrot Theatre) and C'est jamais facile. The latter was directed by ƒΩubom√≠r Roman, who also played one of the characters. A review of Scam read, \\"...actors Marek Majesk√Ω, Andrea Kva≈°≈àovsk√°, Mari√°n Labuda Jr., Dagmar Bruckmayerov√° and Dorota Letenajov√° were given a big opportunity under director and songwriter Nikita Slov√°k, to show their talent for comedy, their movement technique, and even their ability to spontaneously start singing on stage, which isn't a skill every actor possesses.\\" In both the movies Tango s kom√°rmi (2009) and Viditeƒæn√Ω svet (2011), the actress played a similar role of a lonely woman. In the former, she portrayed Tereza, who tries to seduce plumber Bohdan (Eugen Libez≈àuk) with various remarks, while he is working. In the second movie, she plays Veronika, who is determined to get a man by any means necessary, with little regard for the annoying stalking of the protagonist Oliver (Ivan Trojan). Neither of these cases work out: in Viditeƒæn√Ω svet, Verokina even admits that: \\"I enjoy my job so much, it feels like there isn‚Äôt much time for anything else‚Ä¶ Sometimes I think that happiness doesn't even exist anymore‚Äù.(quote from the movie: Viditeƒæn√Ω svet) ==Selected filmography== Television {  Title Production type Country Year Director Role Note - Jablonka Television movie CSSR 1989 J√°n Chleb√≠k Verona  - O troch sestr√°ch Television movie CSFR rowspan=21990 Milo≈° Voln√Ω ≈Ωofka  - Posledn√≠ Television movie CSFR Ivan Petrovick√Ω ƒΩuba Kolomijcev  - Spoveƒè Television movie (in two parts) Slovakia rowspan=21994 Miloslav Luther Young Parisian Bohemian woman  - Princezn√° v je≈æovej ko≈æi Television movie Slovakia Ivan Petrovick√Ω Princess  - ƒåajov√° ≈°√°lka l√°sky Television movie Slovakia 2000 Pavel Gejdo≈° Jr. Anna Hummel  - Mesto tie≈àov Television series Slovakia 2008  Helena Bronansk√°d 1 episode - } Film {  Title Country Year Director Role - Tango s kom√°rmi Slovakia / Czech Republic 2009 Miloslav Luther Tereza - Viditeƒæn√Ω svet Slovakia / Czech Republic 2011 Peter Kri≈°t√∫fek Veronika } Theatre {  Author Title Premiere Director Theatre Role - J√°n Pal√°rik Dmitry Samozvanets 10 December 1988 Pavol Haspra Slovak National Theater Xenia, daughter of Godunov - Alexander Griboyedov Woe from Wit 17 June 1989 Milo≈° Pietor Slovak National Theater Daughter of Count Tugouchov - Pavol Orsz√°gh Hviezdoslav Herodes and Herodias 20 April 1990 Milo≈° Pietor Slovak National Theater Salome - Franz Kafka The Trial 17 November 1990 Roman Pol√°k Astorka Korzo '90 Theatre Girl - George Tabori Mein Kampf 16 January 1991 Roman Pol√°k Slovak National Theatre Gr√©tka - Eug√®ne Ionesco The Bald Soprano 16 March 1991 Juraj Vacul√≠k Astorka Korzo '90 Theatre Mrs. Smith - Colin Higgins Harold and Maude 26 October 1991 Juraj Vacul√≠k Astorka Korzo '90 Theatre Sunshine Dor√© - Milan Kundera Jacques and His Master 12 May 1993 Martin Porubjak Studio S / Studio L+S Ag√°ta, Daughter, Justina - Coline Serreau Lapin lapin 7 April 1995 Pavol Haspra Slovak National Theatre Lucie - Miro Gavran All About Women 17 October 2003 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Agnes, Anita, Biba, Dubravka, Maria - Jozef Gregor-Tajovsk√Ω Statky-zm√§tky 5 March 2004 B≈ôetislav Rychl√≠k J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Beta - J√°n Smrek Poet and Woman 16 April 2004 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Woman 2 - Vinko M√∂derndorfer Mother Died Twice 19 November 2004 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Marijana Dreksler - Moli√®re The Learned Ladies 26 February 2005 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Armanda - Vladim√≠r Hurban Vladim√≠rov Screeching Stamp 15 May 2005 ≈†tefan Korenƒçi A.ha theatre, Bratislava Liana - Matja≈æ Zupanƒçiƒç Couples at Stake 27 January 2006 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava So≈àa - Maurice Hennequin Non B√©b√© 18 November 2006 Nikita Slov√°k Theatre West, Bratislava Meggie Scott - Milan Richter Kafka's Second Life 28 February 2007 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava  - Michal Babiak Roses from the Heart 17 March 2007 Michal Babiak J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Mata Hari - Jean-Claude Islert C'est jamais facile 27 April 2007 ƒΩubo Roman Theatre West, Bratislava Maria - Mirjana Bobiƒá Mojsiloviƒá Imitation of Life 5 February 2009 Michal Babiak Theatre Apollo, Bratislava Olga Kruniƒá, alias Sisi - Eug√®ne Marin Labiche Marc ‚Äì Michel La Station Champbaudet 9 April 2011 ƒΩubom√≠r Vajdiƒçka J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Widow Champbaudet - Maurice Hennequin Scam 18 November 2011 Nikita Slov√°k Theatre West, Bratislava Maggie Scott - Line Knutzon Handvaerkerne 4 May 2013 Viktor Koll√°r J√°n Pal√°rik theatre, Trnava Elizabeth - Peter Quilter Respecting Your Peers 21 May 2017 So≈àa Ferancov√° Arena Theatre, Bratislava Pam } Translation: Luk√°≈° Sab√≥ ==ReferencesExternal links== * Filmography on dabingforum.sk * Filmography on CSFD * Filmography on FDB.cz Category:1969 births Category:Slovak film actresses Category:Slovak actresses Category:20th-century Slovak actresses Category:21st-century Slovak actresses Category:Living people Category:Slovak stage actresses Category:Slovak people of Hungarian descent Category:People from Bratislava ","title":"Dagmar Bruckmayerov√°"},{"id":"54257897","text":"Danielle Rowley (born 25 February 1990) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament for Midlothian from 2017 to 2019.

He was Member of Parliament for East Renfrewshire from 2017 to 2019. ==Early life== Masterton was born on 2 November 1985 in Edinburgh. He attended Buckstone Primary School and George Watson's College. He went on to graduate with a law degree from the University of Dundee in 2007. == Career == After completing his Diploma in Legal Practice in 2008, Masterton obtained a traineeship with the law firm McGrigors, working in their Glasgow and Belfast offices. In 2010, Masterton became a newly qualified solicitor specialising in Pensions and long-term savings, continuing to work with McGrigors, latterly Pinsent Masons, for 9 years, until his election. Masterton was Chairman of his local community council. ==Parliament== Before entering the UK Parliament, Masterton first stood in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election as the Scottish Conservative Party candidate for Paisley. He was unsuccessful, receiving 3,533 votes. In the 2017 General Election, Masterton was the Scottish Conservative Party candidate for East Renfrewshire. Masterton was successful, receiving 21,496 votes, defeating the SNP's Kirsten Oswald by 4,712 votes. In Parliament, Masterton was the Co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Groups on British Jews and Surgical Mesh, and Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Democratic Participation. He was an active member of a number of other APPGs including those on Surrogacy, Pensions, Equitable Life, Post Offices and Single Parents. Between September 2018 and March 2019 Masterton served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Ministerial Team at the Home Office. Masterton resigned his role on 13 March 2019 in order to vote against the Government and oppose the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal on 31 March 2019. As a former pensions solicitor, Masterton was vocal campaigner on pensions issues. In October 2018, he brought a 10 Minute Rule Bill to introduce a new form of pension scheme into the UK, known as Defined Collective Contribution. This followed the agreement between Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union to establish such a scheme for Royal Mail workers in replacement of their final salary scheme. The Bill was adopted as Government policy and a consultation into Collective Defined Contribution Schemes was launched by the DWP in November 2018. In April 2019, Masterton led a debate highlighting the impact of the tapered annual allowance on senior clinical staff who were members of the NHS Pension Fund. Masterton worked closely with the BMA and NHS Employers, successfully lobbying the Department for Health and Social Care, and the Treasury, to make changes to the Scheme and launch a review into the operation of the annual allowance taper. On 12 December 2018, Masterton raised the death of a 13 year old constituent who committed suicide as a result of cyberbullying during Prime Minister's Questions. Masterton has continued to campaign on the issues of self-harm and suicide prevention in young people, and successfully campaigned for the inclusion of a statutory duty of care on technology companies in the Government's Online Harms White Paper. Masterton voted Remain in the 2016 EU Referendum and has been a vocal supporter of securing a withdrawal agreement from the European Union, yet, he voted against the bill to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. In late 2017 Masterton was listed by the Daily Telegraph as one of fifteen Tory \\"Brexit mutineers\\", within a week he had received an anonymous Christmas card describing him as a \\"traitor\\". Masterton was opposed to a second Scottish independence referendum. For the 2019 general election, Masterton stood again for the East Renfrewshire seat but was defeated by Kristen Oswald who was re-elected as the SNP candidate with a majority of 5,426 votes (9.8%) - larger than her previous majority in 2015. == Personal life == Masterton lives with his wife and two children. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1985 births Category:Alumni of the University of Dundee Category:Living people Category:People educated at George Watson's College Category:Scottish Conservative Party MPs Category:Scottish solicitors Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 ","title":"Paul Masterton"},{"id":"54258013","text":"Eleanor Patricia Smith (born 5 July 1957) is a British Labour Party politician. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South West from 2017 to 2019. == Early career == Smith started training to be a nurse in 1977, and worked as theatre nurse from 1984‚Äì2017 at Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust. In 2011, Smith was elected the first black president of the trade union Unison and later served as regional council chair of TUC Midlands. == Parliamentary career == Smith won the Wolverhampton South West seat in 2017 with a majority of 2,185, an increased majority on that of her predecessor Rob Marris. She credited her victory to backing from Unison and Momentum activists rather than her Constituency Labour Party, who she said made her feel like \\"cannon fodder\\". Smith was the first British African-Caribbean person to represent a constituency in the West Midlands in the House of Commons. Smith was a member of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. She was also the Co-chair of two All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs): one on obesity, and the other on adult social care. Smith commissioned an outside agency to produce a review into BAME blood, organ and stem cell donation. The review suggested some actions for the Government to take to increase the number of BAME donations. This led to the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Department of Health and Social Care) Jackie Doyle-Price agreeing to meet Smith. At the 2019 election, Smith lost her seat to the Conservative Party candidate, Stuart Anderson.  Black Country flag controversy  The flag of the Black Country Shortly after her election to the House of Commons, Smith was reported to have criticised the design of the flag of the Black Country because of the association of locally-made chains with the slave trade, and to have suggested that the design of the flag be changed. On Twitter, she denied calling the flag racist or calling for it to be banned, and in her Commons maiden speech, said that her comments \\"had been taken out of proportion\\", and that she had received \\"many abusive messages\\" over the issue. The flag had previously been described as \\"offensive and insensitive\\" in 2015 by Wolverhampton-born anti-racism campaigner and historian Patrick Vernon, who said its chains were a \\"disturbing\\" image of an industry that profited from the transatlantic slave trade and colonial rule in Africa. In 2018, a United Kingdom Independence Party supporter from Castlecroft (an area in Smith's constituency) was given a nine-week suspended prison sentence for sending racist and threatening emails to several MPs, including Smith, in which he told her to be put on \\"the first banana boat\\" to \\"the jungle clearing you came from\\". Both the prosecution and defence cited Smith's reported comments about the flag as having motivated the abusive emails. In July 2020, against the backdrop of the George Floyd protests, West Midlands Fire Service pre-emptively denied permission to local fire stations to fly the Black Country flag on Black Country Day \\"until we have a clear understanding of the meaning of the chains [on the flag]\\" due to the potential link to slavery. == Political positions == Smith never rebelled against her party whip on any vote in Parliament. While her constituency voted to leave the European Union, she generally voted for more EU integration, and consistently voted against reducing central government funding of local government. == Personal life == Smith's parents arrived in Great Britain from Barbados in 1954 as part of the Windrush generation. == References  External links == * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Black British politicians ","title":"Eleanor Smith (politician)"},{"id":"54258022","text":"Vincenzo Bonincontro, O.P.

She was elected in the 2017 United Kingdom general election for the constituency of Peterborough, which she represented from 8 June 2017 to 1 May 2019. Onasanya was found guilty on 19 December 2018 of perverting the course of justice for lying to police to avoid being prosecuted for speeding. She unsuccessfully sought to secure permission to appeal the conviction. Her expulsion from the Labour Party, effective in December 2018, was announced in January 2019. On 29 January 2019 she was sentenced to three months in prison. She was removed from office on 1 May 2019 after a successful recall petition, automatically triggered in cases of a custodial sentence of a year or less, under the Recall of MPs Act 2015. This prompted a by-election, making her the first MP to lose their seat through the recall process. ==Early life and career== Onasanya was born in Cambridge and is of Nigerian ancestry. Her parents, Frank and Paulina Onasanya, separated when she was three and she lived with her mother and younger brother. Onasanya was educated at Netherhall School and studied law at the University of Hertfordshire and the University of Law. She worked at the solicitors Nockolds, then Eversheds. Following her admission as a solicitor in November 2015, she worked at Howes Percival, then DC Law, specialising in commercial property law. Onasanya was elected as Labour Cambridgeshire County Councillor for King's Hedges in Cambridge in 2013 and became deputy leader of the Labour group on the council. She was also the local party's spokeswoman for children and young people and sat on the Council's Joint Consultative Committee for teachers. In 2017 she unsuccessfully sought the nomination to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Onasanya moved to Peterborough in 2014. ==Parliamentary career== For the 2017 general election, Onasanya was selected by the Labour Party to stand in the constituency of Peterborough, which had been held since 2005 by Stewart Jackson, a Conservative. Onasanya defeated Jackson with a majority of 607 votes and a 2.7% swing to Labour. In July 2017, she said that she wished to be Britain's first black female prime minister. Onasanya was appointed as a Labour whip and as a parliamentary private secretary to Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith. She attracted some notice when she quoted lyrics from Man's Not Hot, a viral song, during a budget debate in November 2017. She voted remain in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum and subsequently voiced support for a second vote on Brexit, either by means of a second referendum or a general election. After being found guilty of perverting the course of justice, it was announced in January 2019 that she had been expelled from the Labour Party in December 2018. On 12 March 2019, Onasanya voted against the Government's Brexit withdrawal agreement, leading to its defeat in the second \\"meaningful vote\\". This was reported to be her first vote in the House of Commons since her release from prison and the first occasion that an MP voted while wearing an electronic tag. On 4 April, Onasanya voted to legally require the Prime Minister to seek an extension of Article 50 from the European Union. The bill passed by just one vote and Onasanya's critical role was highlighted by the media. On 27 March, Onasanya was among the 21 MPs who voted against improved LGBT education in schools. In late April, Onasanya made her only speech in the Commons during the period between her release from prison and losing her seat as a result of the successful recall petition. During her two-minute intervention, she disputed the government's assertion that austerity was coming to an end. ==Criminal conviction and removal from office== In July 2018, Onasanya was charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to two speeding incidents which occurred in 2017. The first charge alleged that she was driving the vehicle during a speeding incident on 24 July 2017 but that, with her brother Festus Onasanya, she had claimed that someone else was driving. The second charge concerned a speeding incident on 23 August 2017 when Festus is alleged to have been the one driving. Her brother was charged with three counts, two relating to the same incidents as his sister. She appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 12 July 2018. Onasanya said on 27 July 2018 that she \\"strongly refutes any suggestions that I have broken the law\\". On 13 August 2018 at the Old Bailey, she pleaded not guilty to the one charge against her, relating to an alleged offence in Thorney, Cambridgeshire, in July 2017. Her trial date was set for 12 November 2018. A week before he was due to face trial with his sister, Festus Onasanya admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice. At the first trial, Onasanya said she did not know who was driving on 24 July 2017. She said that she initially mistakenly assumed that she could not have been driving the car on 24 July 2017 due to political commitments and left a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) to be dealt with by whoever had been driving. Her brother, she said, probably returned the form claiming someone else had been driving. She said she now realised that she did have an appointment that would be consistent with her being the driver but could not remember whether she kept the appointment. On 26 November 2018, the jury was discharged as it was unable to reach a verdict.  Conviction and appeal  At a retrial in December 2018, she was unanimously found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Following the verdict, she was immediately suspended from the Labour Party, which also called on her to resign as an MP. She was expelled from the party the following day. Her local newspaper, the Peterborough Telegraph, also called on her to resign. Onasanya continued to protest her innocence, saying in a message to other Labour MPs that she was \\"in good biblical company along with Joseph, Moses, Daniel and his three Hebrew friends who were each found guilty by the courts of their day\\", and that \\"Christ ... was accused and convicted by the courts of his day and yet this was not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter in his story\\". A week later, she indicated that she would not resign her seat. She applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal against the conviction. Fiona Onasanya (right) leaving the Royal Courts of Justice after her application to appeal was rejected On 29 January 2019, Onasanya was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and her brother was sentenced to ten months. As she received a custodial sentence, but of less than 12 months, a recall petition would be started after the appeal process had concluded. The local Labour Party said it would \\"actively\\" campaign in favour of such a petition. (A custodial sentence of more than a year, including a suspended one, would have led to her being removed as an MP automatically, in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1981.) In a statement on 31 January, the Attorney General's Office said it had received a request for the case to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, but on 25 February, it concluded that the sentence was not unduly lenient. Onasanya was released on home detention curfew from HM Prison Bronzefield in Surrey on 26 February. Her ability fully to participate in Parliamentary business depended on the terms of her curfew. On 5 March 2019, her application for permission to appeal against the conviction was refused by the Court of Appeal. Onasanya presented without legal counsel, legal binders or notes, and the court found \\"absolutely no basis\\" for challenging the conviction.  Recall  Later the same day, 5 March, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, duly informed the House that he gave notice under Section 1 of the Recall of MPs Act 2015 that the opening of a recall petition against Onasanya may be organised; if more than 10% of the Peterborough electorate were to sign such a petition within six weeks, then her seat in the House of Commons would become forfeit and a by-election would be triggered, though she would be free to stand in that by-election. The recall petition was called on 19 March and was available for signature until 1 May 2019. On the day prior to the recall petition being called, Onasanya released a video protesting her innocence. On 1 May, it was announced that the recall petition had exceeded the necessary threshold of 10% of the electors in her seat: 19,261, or 27.6%, had signed. As a result, her seat was declared vacant, causing a by-election in Peterborough. The Electoral Commission later disclosed that 28% of eligible voters had signed the petition, with the threshold of 10% being reached in the first two days. On 3 May, Onasanya announced that she would not stand in the by-election. The previous Labour candidate, Lisa Forbes, stood again for the party, winning the by-election.  Removal as a solicitor  In August 2019 a disciplinary tribunal of the Solicitors Regulation Authority struck Onasanya from the roll of solicitors and ordered her to pay costs of ¬£6,562, after finding that she had \\"failed to act with integrity\\", had not \\"(upheld) the rule of law and proper administration of justice\\" and had \\"acted dishonestly\\". ==Personal life== Onasanya lives in Paston, Peterborough, and attends iCAN Community Church in East London. She is a member of Christians on the Left (formerly the Christian Socialist Movement). It has been claimed that her religious beliefs partly stem from being involved in a road traffic collision as a child, when, although Onasanya was badly injured, her mother took her home and prayed rather than taking her to hospital. She is a patron of Women Worldwide Advocating Freedom and Equality and was a trustee of East Hertfordshire YMCA, which closed in June 2018. Onasanya stated during her trial, in November 2018, that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In 2020 she self- published a memoir Snakes & Adders. In June 2020, Onasanya attracted national and international attention by accusing Kellogg's of racism for using a monkey as the mascot of their Coco Pops cereal. ==See also== *Chris Davies ‚Äì former MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, the second MP to have faced a recall petition under the terms of the Recall of MPs Act 2015, and who was defeated in the subsequent by-election held in August 2019. *Chris Huhne ‚Äì resigned as a Member of Parliament in 2013 when he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice over a speeding case in 2003, in relation to the matter of who was driving. == References External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century English criminals Category:21st- century British women politicians Category:Alumni of the University of Hertfordshire Category:Alumni of the University of Law Category:Black English women Category:Black British politicians Category:English female criminals Category:British people convicted of perverting the course of justice Category:British politicians convicted of crimes Category:Councillors in Cambridgeshire Category:English people of Nigerian descent Category:English solicitors Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Independent members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:People educated at Netherhall School Category:People from Cambridge Category:People with multiple sclerosis Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales ","title":"Fiona Onasanya"},{"id":"54258034","text":"335P/Gibbs is a periodic comet in the Solar System.

She is a former executive director of the National LGBTQ Task Force. She served as executive deputy of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and as the vice chair of the New York State AIDS Advisory Council. She was also President of the New York State Civil Service Commission and Commissioner of the New York State Department of Civil Service. In 1996, she became the Associate Deputy Secretary of Labor at the United States Department of Labor, and in 1997 she became the Assistant to the President for Management and Administration under the Clinton administration. In 2007, she began serving on the Commission on Public Integrity, where she worked until her retirement. == Early life and education == Virginia Apuzzo was born in the Bronx in New York City on June 26, 1941. Her parents were both working-class Italians; her father owned a gas station and her mother worked at various times as a waitress, factory worker, and salesperson. Apuzzo attended Catholic high school. She enrolled at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and graduated in 1963 with a Bachelor of Science in History and Education. In the 1960s, she became a teacher and chair of the Social Studies Department at the Marlboro Central School District in Marlboro, New York. When Apuzzo was 26, she became a nun at the Sisters of Charity, a convent in the Bronx. By this time, she knew she was a lesbian. She later recounted her experience, saying \\"I tried to play by the rules. I thought I'd have to live my life with this deep dark secret.\\" She also said, \\"I stayed [at the convent for] three years searching for answers to fundamental questions... I thought of my religious life as temporary. I didn't know whether it would take one year or twenty years to explore the morality of my homosexual identity.\\" She continued to teach during her time at the convent, both at Cathedral High School in New York City and at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale, New York. Apuzzo left the convent in 1969, days after the Stonewall riots. She began teaching education at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. She was later awarded tenure, and continued teaching there until 1986. == Political career and activism == During the 1970s, Apuzzo became a member of the Coordinating Committee of the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus. In 1973 she earned a Master of Science in Urban Education from Fordham University, and began studying towards her Doctor of Education in the same subject the next year. In 1978 she co-founded the Lambda Independent Democrats. That same year she tried to get elected to the New York State Assembly but was unsuccessful. By 1979, Apuzzo took a leave of absence from Brooklyn College to serve as the assistant commissioner for operations in the New York City Department of Health. During her time at the Department of Health, she became a strong advocate for people with AIDS. She created a telephone hotline to educate and provide resources about AIDS, and she testified at the first congressional hearing on AIDS where she criticized the government, saying the response to the virus was insufficient. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Apuzzo became a frequent lecturer on civil rights at schools including Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia. She also was a guest on television shows including Nightline, The MacNeil-Lehrer Report, CBS Morning News, 20/20, and the Phil Donahue Show. Apuzzo joined the National LGBTQ Task Force (then called the National Gay Task Force), and went on to serve as executive director from 1983‚Äì1985. In 1980 she became a delegate to the Democratic National Convention when she co-authored the first gay and lesbian civil rights portion of the Democratic party platform. She was one of few openly gay delegates at that time. She and her partner joined the Women's Caucus, a branch of the National LGBTQ Task Force. They began to work towards lesbian rights, challenging popular feminists who they felt were not accepting of lesbians within the feminist movement. In 1984, New York Governor Mario Cuomo appointed Apuzzo to a panel investigating potential discrimination against gay people with regards to state employment, services, and benefits. In 1985 he made Apuzzo executive deputy of the New York State Consumer Protection Board (where she served until 1989) and the vice chair of the New York State AIDS Advisory Council (where she served until 1996). During this time she confronted pharmaceutical companies over the increasing costs of AIDS medication, began investigations into products that were fraudulently marketed as AIDS cures, and worked to draft new insurance policies. In 1988, Apuzzo was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law by Queens College, City University of New York. Apuzzo served as the President of the New York State Civil Service Commission and as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Civil Service before becoming the Associate Deputy Secretary of Labor at the United States Department of Labor in 1996. In 1997, President Bill Clinton appointed Apuzzo as Assistant to the President for Management and Administration. This made her the most senior openly gay person in the Clinton administration. In 2005, she was one of the founders of the Hudson Valley LGBTQ Community Center which opened in 2007 in Kingston, New York. In 2007, the Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer appointed Apuzzo to the Commission on Public Integrity. She worked in this role until her retirement. == References External links== * Interview with Virginia Apuzzo in WGBH's public television series \\"American Experience: Stonewall Uprising\\", 2011 * Virginia Apuzzo papers at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Category:1941 births Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American women's rights activists Category:Brooklyn College faculty Category:Clinton administration personnel Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:State University of New York at New Paltz alumni Category:Living people Category:Fordham University alumni ","title":"Virginia Apuzzo"},{"id":"54258069","text":"Mohammad Yasin MP (born 15 October 1971) is a Pakistan-born British Labour Party politician.

These echinoderms are identified by a specialized respiratory structure, called diplopores. Diplopores are a double pore system that sit within a depression on a single thecal (body) plate; each plate can contain numerous diplopore pairs. The diploporitans likely represent a polyphyletic group. The evidence for this claim lies within the highly morphologically diverse body plans of the diploporitans: there are major differences in the makeup of the attachment structure (e.g., stem or holdfast), in the makeup of the feeding grooves, and even major differences in the construction of the group-defining diplopore respiratory structures. The only phylogenetic analysis of Diploporita to date indicates that Diploporita is not a natural evolutionary group. Rather, Diploporita is an artificial grouping based on the presence of diplopores, that have re-evolved multiple times throughout the echinoderm evolutionary tree. == Evolution ==  Major Taxonomic Groups  There are three major groups of Diploporita that have been traditionally proposed: the Asteroblastida, Glyptosphaeritida, and the Sphaeronitida. These three groups, which are markedly different from one another, are found in approximately the same age strata in the Early Ordovician of the Prague Basin. Of these proposed groups, only one has been thought to be monophyletic: the Sphaeronitida. This group is characterized by short ambulacral feeding grooves and holdfasts that cement directly to a hard substrate, instead of a stem.  Ancestry  At this time, it is not clear to which group Diploporita is most closely related. It has been suggested that the paraphyletic group Eocrinoidea could have given rise to diploporitans, as well as other groups of blastozoans, but the evidence for this is inconclusive at this time. ==Distribution== Information concerning the distribution of diploporitan fossils is constantly changing, as more field sites are found and fossils from these are described. This description of diploporitan fossil occurrences is only meant to be a general introduction and is not an exhaustive list. Ordovician Diploporitans in the Ordovician were very diverse, with a high estimate of 176 species. Diploporitans are routinely found preserved from the Ordovician in Gondwana (i.e., southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East), Baltica, South China, and European Laurentia (e.g., United Kingdom). Ordovician Occurrences of diploporitans in North American Laurentia are limited to only a very small number of instances. The Late Ordovician Bromide Formation is one of the few, and likely the most well-known, outcrops of diploporitan fossils, Eumorphocystis multiporata Silurian The end- Ordovician extinction represented a large-scale extinction for diploporitans. The majority of diploporitan species went extinct during this period and they never returned to their high species numbers after this time. During the Silurian, there was a much larger presence of diploporitans in North American than during the Ordovician. These diploporitans, called the Holocystites Fauna, appeared in North America during the middle of the Silurian. These diploporitans, representing multiple genera, all share the same basic features: reduced food grooves, large plates to support feeding structures that branched off of the surface of the body, and specialized diplopore respiratory structures, called humatipores (diplopores that are connected by multiple canals below the surface of the plate). The Holocystites Fauna is mostly found in the midcontinental United States (e.g., Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee) and does not survive past the end of the Silurian. Paulicystis sparsus, holocystitid diploporitan from middle Silurian rocks of Indiana. Note the humatipore respiratory structures that pierce the plates of the body wall. (University of Iowa Paleontology Repository, SUI 48164) Other Silurian occurrences of diploporitans worldwide are rare and limited to only a few species (e.g., Eucystis). These occurrences are largely restricted to southern Europe. Devonian Devonian occurrences of diploporitans are also quite rare. Most examples of this are, similar to the Silurian, limited to a few species in southern Europe. It was thought that diploporitans likely went extinct during the Early Devonian. However, a recent discovery found a new genus of diploporitan from the Middle Devonian, 50 million years after the last known diploporitan occurrence, in Kentucky, USA (Laurentia) == References == Category:Blastozoa ","title":"Diploporita"},{"id":"54258116","text":"Chi-Ming Che (; born 1957 in Hong Kong), is a Hong Kong chemist currently holding Zhou Guangzhao Professorship in Natural Sciences, following a Dr. Hui Wai-Haan's Chair of Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). In 1995, he became the first scientist from Hong Kong to be elected as a member of Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is known for extensive work in inorganic chemistry, photochemistry, and medicinal chemistry. == Career == Che received his B.S. degree at HKU in 1978. He then received his Ph. D degree in inorganic chemistry at HKU working under Professor Chung-Kwong Poon in 1980. After earning his Ph. D., he spent 3 years at California Institute of Technology conducting research in organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry in the laboratory of Harry B. Gray. Following his research stay in the United States, Che moved back to Hong Kong and started his independent career as a faculty at HKU. During the past 20 years, he has also held visiting lecturer positions at National Taiwan University, Jilin University, Sun Yat-sen University. Moreover, he has been a professor at Nanjing University, Nankai University, and Tsinghua University; and an honorary professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Northeast Normal University, Nanjing University, and other universities. In 2007, he was elected as a member of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) in Chemical Sciences. In 2013, he was elected as a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Currently, he is the Chair Professor of the Department of Chemistry at The University of Hong Kong. == Research == Che's research interests cover various areas in chemistry such as inorganic chemistry, materials science, photochemistry, and biomedical sciences. He has been engaged in inorganic chemistry research, organometallic synthesis where he and his group have studied high-valent and multimetallic complexes. These molecules have been investigated for their luminescent and catalytic properties. Notable systems that Che has developed include: catalysts for asymmetric olefin epoxidation, biomimetic oxidation catalyst featuring recognition elements, and molecular devices based on luminescent materials.  Triplet Emitters  Che is a pioneer for the chemistry of d8 and d10 metal complexes including their excited state chemistry and closed shell metal-metal interactions of d8 and d10 metal ions. His team has successfully developed practical tetradentate platinum(II) and gold(III) Emitters which are comparable if not superior in performances to the World best Iridium(III) Phosphors  Metal Catalysts  Che has pioneered the developed of Ru-OXO system which has opened up numerous opportunities for efficient catalytic oxidation processes. Ruthenium(III) porphyrin functionalized with PEG group is used as a catalyst to drive selective pathway of alkene to epoxide or cyclopropane. Furthermore, Che and co-workers developed new methods for epoxidation, cyclopropanation, and aziridination of alkenes. His work on bioinorganic chemistry, has produced new understanding for several important processes including modern nitrogen fixation.  Anti- Cancer Metal Complexes  Another notable work from Che's group has been the development of gold-, platinum-, ruthenium- and palladium based metal compounds with anti-tumor activity. Specifically, they found that PEGylated gold(III) conjugates can exhibit multifunctional properties and undergo selective delivery to tumor tissues. Importantly, some of these compounds do not exhibit harmful cytotoxicity to normal cells, as many Pt-based anti-cancer agents do.

She has served as the Liberal Democrat Leader of the House of Commons and the Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Justice and Women and Equalities under Sir Ed Davey since 2020. Hobhouse served under Tim Farron and Sir Vince Cable as Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government from 2017 to 2019. She served under Jo Swinson as Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Transport from 2019 to 2020. She was the Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Energy and Climate Change from February 2019 to August 2019 and again from January 2020 to September 2020. ==Early life and career== Wera Benedicta von Reden was born on 8 February 1960 in Hanover, Germany. She studied history and fine art at the University of M√ºnster and afterwards studied art for two years at the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris. She then moved back to Germany, completing a master's degree in history and fine art in Berlin. She married William Hobhouse in 1989 and moved to England the following year. They first lived in Liverpool, where Wera Hobhouse opened an art gallery on Falkner Street. They moved to Rochdale in 1999. Prior to her political career, she was a teacher, radio journalist and artist. Hobhouse was first elected in 2004 as a Conservative councillor for the ward of Norden on Rochdale Council, Greater Manchester. At the same election, her husband was elected as a Conservative councillor for the ward of Bamford, also in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Her political career in Rochdale was defined by the Spodden Valley asbestos controversy; the proposed development of 650 homes on an asbestos-contaminated site. Hobhouse and her husband opposed the proposals, leading them to defect to the Liberal Democrats in 2005. They were criticised at the time for not triggering by-elections to seek fresh mandates as Liberal Democrat councillors. The development was blocked seven years later in 2011. Hobhouse was reelected in 2006 and 2010 for the Liberal Democrats in Norden. The Liberal Democrats assumed majority control of Rochdale Council in 2007; Hobhouse served as the cabinet member for the environment between 2006 and 2009 and chaired the health scrutiny committee from 2009 to 2010. After the Liberal Democrats lost majority control of the council in 2010, and following poor local election results, Hobhouse was elected as the leader of the much-reduced Liberal Democrat group on Rochdale Council in May 2011. In July 2011, Hobhouse accused a council officer of failing to act impartially, and later apologised after the council officer began legal action for defamation. Hobhouse unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Heywood and Middleton in the 2010 general election. In 2014, she retired as a councillor for Norden and moved to Bath. In the local elections of May 2015 she stood unsuccessfully for election to the Bath and North East Somerset Council in the Peasedown ward. On the same day, she contested North East Somerset at the 2015 election, again unsuccessfully. ==Parliamentary career== Shortly before the 2017 general election, Hobhouse was selected to stand for parliament in Bath when the prospective candidate stood down. The constituency was held by the Conservative MP Ben Howlett, and had previously been held by the Liberal Democrat Don Foster from 1992 to 2015. Hobhouse stood on a pro-European platform which emphasised housing, education, congestion and pollution concerns, as well as opposition to the incumbent Conservative MP 's plans to link the A46 and A36 roads together. Her party emphasised the need for Labour supporters to vote tactically for Hobhouse to defeat the Conservatives. Hobhouse gained the seat with a majority of 5,694 votes and a 17.6% increase in the Liberal Democrat vote share, the second- highest vote share increase for the party nationally. Following her election, Hobhouse was appointed as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing, communities and local government. She made her maiden speech on 29 June 2017, and sits on the Committee on Exiting the European Union. On 6 March 2018, Hobhouse presented a Private Members' Bill to amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003; her bill aimed to outlaw acts of voyeurism, especially upskirting, which were not then explicitly covered by UK law. Justice Secretary David Gauke signalled that the government would support Hobhouse's bill, which was later supported by the Prime Minister, Theresa May. Hobhouse's bill was not debated at its presentation in the House of Commons. At its second reading in the Commons on 15 June 2018, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to Hobhouse's bill, preventing its passage through the Commons. Chope's actions drew immediate criticism from fellow MPs. May also expressed her disappointment at the objection. Chope said that his reason for blocking the bill's passage was in objection to parliamentary procedure rather than to the bill itself: he stated that he would \\"wholeheartedly\\" support a government bill that outlawed upskirting. Following his objection, the government reaffirmed its commitment to introduce legislation to outlaw upskirting. A government bill to outlaw upskirting was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 June 2018; and passed its second reading on 3 July 2018 to become the Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019. In an interview with HuffPost UK published in May 2018, Hobhouse warned against the \\"toxic\\" immigration debate in the UK. She acknowledged her party's limited resources following its electoral collapse at the 2015 general election, and affirmed that she was happy with Vince Cable as the party's leader. She urged the party to do more to increase its diversity. In July 2018, Hobhouse was criticised for claiming ¬£4,800 in parliamentary expenses for a heavy duty colour printer. Defending her actions, Hobhouse said that she had saved the taxpayer ¬£40,000 by taking over the lease from Bath's previous MP and that she required the printer for her constituency letters. In October 2018, Hobhouse's constituency office announced that it had completed 6,000 pieces of casework. Wera Hobhouse announced winner at the Bath 2019 general election declaration, alongside Annabel Tall the Conservative candidate In February 2019, Hobhouse was made the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the environment and climate change. In this capacity, Hobhouse pushed for an end to most carbon emissions by 2030, and for net-zero carbon emissions to be achieved by 2045 at the latest. This became the policy position of the Liberal Democrats at their conference in September 2019, where Hobhouse gave a keynote speech on tackling the climate crisis. Among the proposals that she has promoted to meet these targets, Hobhouse has called for a permanent ban on fracking, for increased investment in renewable energy, for greater powers to be given to local authorities to cut emissions, and for all airport expansion to be halted until a replacement can be found for jet fuel. In February 2020, Hobhouse announced that she would be a candidate in the 2020 Liberal Democrats leadership election, before withdrawing in June and endorsing Layla Moran. According to the register of MPs' interests, it was found that Hobhouse had no registered donations for her leadership campaign before dropping out. Hobhouse is a former member of the governing council of the Electoral Reform Society. She supports proportional representation for UK elections and claims that the coalition government's failure to secure electoral reform was its \\"biggest disappointment\\". Hobhouse supports abortion reform in Northern Ireland, and has supported a campaign to improve the treatment of eating disorders, including by leading a parliamentary debate on destigmatising them. In local politics, she launched a petition to fund a large police station for the city. ==Personal life== Wera Hobhouse has been married to William Hobhouse since 1989. They both cite the fall of the Berlin Wall as a pivotal moment in their lives, which they witnessed when they lived in Germany. They have four children, two sons and two daughters. She naturalised as a British citizen in 2007. She and her husband own a Rochdale and Germany based company, Compotex, that manufactures bonding, priming and adhesion products for the textile and rubber industries. Wera Hobhouse is a Christian. Although her mother and grandmother identified as Christians, her great-grandfather was Jewish; which meant that her family were persecuted under the Nuremberg Laws. Hobhouse is fluent in English, German and French. She cites Barack Obama and William Wilberforce as her political idols. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:Liberal Democrats (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Conservative Party (UK) councillors Category:Politics of Bath, Somerset Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Councillors in Greater Manchester Category:Liberal Democrats (UK) councillors Category:Politicians from Hanover Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:German emigrants to England Category:British people of German-Jewish descent Category:British Christians Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì ","title":"Wera Hobhouse"},{"id":"54258134","text":"Anna Rhiannon McMorrin (born 24 September 1971) is a Welsh Labour Party politician.

Shortly after becoming an MP, McMorrin asked leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, for an urgent debate about the 1,100 Tesco job losses in Cardiff North. McMorrin strongly opposed the decision, and asked for it to be reviewed. McMorrin was successful in gaining an urgent debate in the House of Commons on 19 July 2017, and in her speech said she wished to \\"highlight the way in which Tesco has acted; secondly, describe the human impact of these actions; and finally, explore how we respond to these things and the next steps.\\". McMorrin was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Barry Gardiner MP, Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade until 13 June 2018. McMorrin is a member of the Environmental Audit Select Committee and joined the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on 24 October 2017 following criticism of both an unfilled committee and an all-male lineup. On 13 June 2018, McMorrin and five other Labour MPs resigned their roles as frontbenchers for the Labour Party in protest at Labour's Brexit position. Leader Jeremy Corbyn had instructed his MPs to abstain in a vote which Britain would remain in the single market by joining the European Economic Area (EEA). The MPs resigned and voted in favour of the EEA. McMorrin voted against the Labour Party whip and in favour of an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Group for a second public vote on EU membership in March 2019. On 12 December 2019, McMorrin was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Cardiff North. ==Personal life== McMorrin has two daughters.

She served as the Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2017 to 2019, and as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath from 2017 to 2019. Laird narrowly defeated the sitting MP, Roger Mullin of the SNP, by 259 votes at the 2017 general election, but lost her seat to Neale Hanvey, the SNP candidate (though he was suspended from the party at the time) at the 2019 general election. A councillor from 2012 to 2018, Laird is the former deputy leader of Fife Council, where she also held the administration portfolio for economy and planning. ==Early life and career== Laird was born in Greenock and educated at James Watt College, Caledonian University and then Edinburgh Napier University. Prior to election, she was employed in senior human resources posts in the electronic, semiconductor and financial service industries. Laird was first selected by her Constituency Labour Party to contend the 2012 local elections, and was returned alongside her Scottish Labour running mate. She was appointed spokesperson for economy and planning in February 2013 and one year later was elected by her fellow Labour councillors to the post of deputy leader. Laird spoke on behalf of Fife Council at the Barclay Review looking at non-domestic rates across Scotland and called for reform, saying the current scheme favoured out-of-town retailers. She led the call from Fife Council for a radical overhaul of the Scottish planning system. She also secured regeneration of Fraser Avenue in Inverkeithing, a project which was commended by the Saltire Society. Laird sought selection for the Scottish Labour regional list for the Mid Scotland and Fife region in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. ==Parliamentary career== For the 2017 snap general election, Laird was selected to stand as the Scottish Labour candidate for the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency; once held by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. She overturned Roger Mullin of the SNP's majority to become the constituency's new Member of Parliament, receiving 36.8% of the vote. Laird was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland less than a week later on 14 June 2017. Laird's maiden speech at the House of Commons focused on poverty in her constituency and quoted Kirkcaldy-born economist Adam Smith, as well as former PM Winston Churchill: Laird continued to regularly campaign on poverty issues in the constituency, working in partnership with local charities in a bid to overturn the UK government‚Äôs new flagship welfare policy, Universal Credit. By enlisting support from Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaigners, Unison and Citizens Advice Rights Fife, Laird also hosted a number of public campaign events aimed at 1950s-born women who were affected by age-related eligibility changes. In response to public concern with ongoing flaring at Fife Ethylene Plant (FEP), Laird established a Mossmorran Working Group, the first to include cross-party elected representatives, community groups, as well as representatives from FEP operators Shell UK, ExxonMobil, the Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency also attended. Laird held a public meeting with ScotRail director Alex Hynes in Kirkcaldy in February 2019, to discuss franchise operator Abellio's poor performance record in Fife, particularly during that winter, when stop- skipping and train delays were a regular occurrence. Although transport issues were devolved, Laird later lobbied the Scottish Government to use an early break-clause in its Abellio contract. On 18 December 2019, transport minister Michael Matheson announced he would cancel the contract three years early, in 2022. Laird intervened when local constituents fell victim to automated push payment (APP) fraud. Despite the Santander Bank's insistence that they were not at fault, Laird later succeeded in securing a ¬£278,000 repayment to victims. She also campaigned against bank closures across the constituency. The MP secured a pledge from the Ministry of Defence to finance work to clean- up radiation at Dalgety Bay - an issue blighted by two decades of inactivity. Laird called for reform to planning law after residents objected to large- scale development in Aberdour, and campaigned for regeneration of Kirkcaldy town centre, holding talks with Columbia Threadneedle, former owners of the Postings, and LaSalle, former owners of the Mercat. She argued for government intervention for local industry to protect jobs, most notably in the case of Bifab and Babcock at Rosyth shipyard. In May 2018, Laird faced criticism for neglecting her duties as a councillor, having only attended two meetings after her election as an MP. Critics argued she should have resigned as a councillor when becoming a Member of Parliament. Her party's rules later stated members should only hold one elected position, a policy Laird appeared to have breached, according to the National newspaper. Laird actually resigned the post in June 2018. Laird resigned as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in December 2019 after losing her seat to the Independent (formerly SNP) candidate Neale Hanvey. Following her resignation, she criticised unsupportive members of her party for undermining the leaderships of Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. Laird endorsed Keir Starmer in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Personal website * - - Category:1958 births Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Living people Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:21st- century British women politicians Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Fife constituencies Category:People educated at James Watt College Category:People from Greenock Category:Alumni of Glasgow Caledonian University Category:Alumni of Edinburgh Napier University Category:Scottish Labour Party councillors Category:Councillors in Fife ","title":"Lesley Laird"},{"id":"54258157","text":"Sally Jacobsen (June 12, 1946 ‚Äì May 12, 2017) was an American journalist, foreign correspondent and editor whose career spanned 39-years at the Associated Press.

He was the first in his family to go to university studying politics and sociology at the University of Bristol before gaining a master's degree in politics at Goldsmiths in London. He was active in his community at a young age, inspired by his parents‚Äô involvement in the area. Morgan's grandfather, from Southsea, left Portsmouth aged 17 to take part in the D-day landings where he served in the Royal Army Service Corps. After WW2, Morgan's grandfather continued to live in Portsmouth and helped found the local branch of Normandy Veterans Association. Morgan has publicly stated that his grandfather's actions are one of the reasons behind his work on veterans‚Äô rights and adequate care for older members of the community. Morgan has been chair of Portsmouth Cultural Consortium, a resident-led group committed to improving the city through cultural regeneration, vice chair of Age UK Portsmouth and a governor at Arundel Court Junior School and his former secondary, Priory School. Before going into politics, Morgan's career was in local government working at Portsmouth City Council, later becoming Head of Community Engagement for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. From 2015 until the snap general election of 2017, he was CEO of Basingstoke Voluntary Action. This role allowed him to run for public office for the first time and in May 2016 he became the councillor for Charles Dickens, a central ward in Portsmouth City Council. Later that year, he became the Leader of the Portsmouth Labour Group. ==Parliamentary career== On 8 June 2017, a snap general election called by Prime Minister Theresa May was held, in which he defeated the incumbent Conservative MP Flick Drummond for Portsmouth South by a majority of 1,554 and a swing of 9.4% from Conservative to Labour increasing the share of the vote by 21.5%, one of the largest increases in the country. This makes him the first member of his party to represent the seat since its creation in 1918. In his victory speech Morgan said, \\"Portsmouth had voted for hope\\". He later said \\"It has been a dream of mine to be an MP ever since I joined the party at the age of 16.\\" In the general election of December 2019, Morgan more than trebled his majority again recording one of the highest increase in Labour share of the vote in the country at 7.6%. In Parliament, Morgan has served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Andrew Gwynne, the Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and on the Public Accounts Committee. From July 2019 until April 2020, he served in the Shadow Communities and Local Government team as a Shadow Minister. The brief included policy areas such as adult social care, children's services, faith and community cohesion, welfare reform and debt services to community pubs. Morgan says his priorities are tackling crime, standing up for schools, investment in the NHS, being a strong voice on defence and addressing climate change. Morgan frequently speaks out on veterans‚Äô issues citing Portsmouth's naval history and his own grandfather's military service as his motivation. On 3 April 2019 he hosted a Westminster Hall debate calling on the government to take further action on reducing veteran suicide. During the debate Morgan called on the Government to begin recording veterans‚Äô suicide, claiming this will improve mental health support services for the armed forces and veterans. From January 2020 until April 2020 Morgan was the Shadow Minister for Defence Procurement. The brief included the delivery of the equipment and support, nuclear enterprise, exports, cyber, innovation, science and technology, estates and environment and sustainability. In April 2020, the new leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer appointed him as Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces. Morgan has often criticised spending cuts to schools and colleges. He regularly visits schools in Portsmouth, and set up the Inspiring Fratton awards to inspire people from his home district to ‚Äúaim high, work hard, and achieve their dreams‚Äù. In 2016 Morgan campaigned for the remain side in the EU referendum. The constituency narrowly voted to leave, with a split of 51.76% leave and 48.24% remain, reflecting the national result. Morgan was an early supporter of the People's Vote campaign arguing that giving the public another chance to vote on Brexit would end what many considered the national constitutional crisis at the time. He vowed to lead the remain campaign in Portsmouth if this referendum had took place. He is an officer on the Key Cities APPG, Cycling APPG, and LGBT Labour, and a member of the Fabian Society. Morgan has vowed to not report constituents to the Home Office for immigration enforcement. ==Personal life== Morgan lives in Southsea. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:1981 births Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:People educated at Priory School, Portsmouth Category:People educated at Portsmouth College Category:LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"Stephen Morgan (British politician)"},{"id":"54258178","text":"Simon Richard Clarke (born 28 September 1984) is a British Conservative Party politician who is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.

He was also a local government councillor on North Lanarkshire Council from 2017 until July 2019. ==Early life== Gaffney was raised in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire; he has three brothers and two sisters. He is married and has three sons. Since he was in his twenties, until being elected, Gaffney worked for Royal Mail and Parcelforce,LinkedIn and wore his former work uniform to Westminster on his first day in the House of Commons. ==Political career== Gaffney was elected to the North Lanarkshire Council in 2017, representing the Thorniewood ward.

In the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election, Gaffney supported Richard Leonard to succeed Kezia Dugdale to be Scottish Labour leader over the alternative candidate Anas Sarwar; Gaffney's own Constituency Labour Party (CLP) took a firm stance on supporting Leonard's campaign. In January 2018, Gaffney made jokes at a Labour Students Burns supper in which he used the phrases \\"bent\\" to describe gay people and \\"chinky\\" to describe Chinese food. He was not suspended from the Labour Party but instead given mandatory equality and diversity training. He later also apologised for the jokes. Gaffney resigned as a councillor in North Lanarkshire Council in July 2019, triggering a council by-election. In his resignation letter to the council's chief executive, Gaffney said he had been privileged to serve the community into which he had been born and bred.

The existence of a local under-density has been the subject of many pieces of literature and research articles, the kind of which were penned starting in the early 90's. The under-density is proposed to be roughly spherical, approximately 2 billion light-years (600 megaparsecs, Mpc) in diameter. As other voids, it is not completely empty but contains the Milky Way, the Local Group, and a larger part of the Laniakea Supercluster. The Milky Way is within a few hundred million light-years of the void's centre. The existence of supervoids have been shown to be consistent with the standard cosmological model. Galaxies inside a void experience a gravitational pull from outside the void and this yields a larger local value for the Hubble constant, a cosmological measure of how fast the universe expands. Some authors have proposed the structure as the cause of the discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble constant using galactic supernovae and Cepheid variables (72‚Äì75 km/s/Mpc) and from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillation data (67‚Äì68 km/s/Mpc). However, other work has found no evidence for this in observations, finding the scale of the claimed under- density to be incompatible with observations which extend beyond its radius. ==See also== * Void (astronomy) * Giant Void * Local Void * Observable universe * List of largest voids * Hubble bubble (astronomy) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Voids (astronomy) ","title":"KBC Void"},{"id":"54258227","text":"Trudeau House, near Tunica in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, was built in about 1830.

He was re-elected in the 2019 general election. ==Early life== Western was educated in St Albans and graduated with a BSc degree in Geography from the University of Bristol in 1984. Prior to entering politics, Western worked in various senior management roles during a 24-year career with Peugeot both in the UK and Paris, France. He specialised in Finance, Procurement and Marketing. ==Political career== Western entered politics relatively late in life, and was elected to the Leamington Willes ward of Warwickshire County Council for the first time in 2013. Western was elected again in 2017 shortly before becoming an MP. He resigned as a Councillor in March 2018. While a councillor, Western volunteered as a careers mentor at Campion School in Leamington Spa. As an MP Western has served on the International Trade Select Committee since September 2017 and on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee since February 2018. Western is the Chair of the Parliamentary Campaign for Council Housing, which aims to increase the number of council houses being built and represent the interests of council tenants, and is also a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Students. In December 2017, Western criticised the Warwick District Council for a proposal to relocate the Council's offices to a new site in Leamington. Western objected to the plans, stating that the new development would consist of ‚Äú100 per cent private housing, with no social, affordable or council housing on the site‚Äù. In response to the plans, Western started a petition in protest against the move. As of 3 December 2019, the petition had gained over 8,000 signatures. In September 2019, Warwick District Council leader Andrew Day asked Western to \\"stop playing political games with the regeneration of town\\" over Western's opposition to plans to relocate the council's headquarters. However, as a result of Western's petition and a campaign by a local pressure group, the project was put on hold and the private equity backed partner company PSP was withdrawn. Western stated that the scrapped plans would result in Warwick District Council having to pay out ¬£1.2m in compensation to PSP, even though there was never an official tendering process. In February 2019, Western proposed a Bill that sought to limit the driving hours worked by bus drivers on local routes. The bill, known as Rowan's Law, was introduced in response to a bus crash in 2005 in Coventry, which killed 76-year-old pedestrian Dora Hancox, and 7-year-old passenger Rowan Fitzgerald from Western's constituency. Driver exhaustion was said to have played a role in the crash, and Rowan's Law sought to prevent any similar future tragedies. In May 2019, the Sun On Sunday described Western as a ‚Äúcycling fanatic‚Äù, reporting that he had claimed expenses for cycling to appointments around his constituency. Western asserted that he was simply ‚Äúdoing the right thing by cycling and not driving‚Äù in a town with issues with air quality. Western went on to say that the expenses were \\"HMRC-approved\\" and \\"that cycle mileage claims are considerably less than car mileage claims\\". In June 2019, Western claimed that Jeremy Corbyn is not an anti-semite. In June 2019, Western led a Parliamentary debate on social housing. The Commons passed his motion calling on the Government to carry out a mass council housebuilding programme. In August 2019, Western was a signatory to a letter calling on the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to intervene and prevent India's revocation of Article 370 regarding the province of Kashmir's self-autonomy. The letter urged \\"the United Nations to do everything in its power to de- escalate\\" the situation. In October 2019, Western was a signatory to a letter calling for the Labour Party to adopt plans to build 100,000 Council Homes, in line with the Labour Campaign for Council Housing's proposals. The policy was later adopted by the Labour Party in its manifesto. ==Policies and views== Western has been vocal in his support for sustainable energy. While a County Councillor, he was instrumental in introducing the Warwickshire Energy Plan in 2015. Western has also advocated in favour of electric vehicles, and from Jul 2019, served as Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Electric Vehicles. Western is a signatory of the MPs Not Border Guards pledge, which vows to not report constituents to the Home Office for immigration enforcement. ==Personal life== Western lives in Leamington with his wife Rebecca Earle, a history professor at Warwick University.

He was re- elected, with former Conservative MP and Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe having stood against him. He was promoted to shadow environment secretary after Hayman lost her seat in 2019. As shadow environment secretary, he argued for amendments to the 2020 Fisheries Bill to require fish from the UK's quota to land in UK ports and to give more quota access to smaller-scale fishers. In the 2020 Labour Party leadership election and deputy leadership election, he nominated Keir Starmer and Rosena Allin-Khan and endorsed Starmer and Angela Rayner. He was described by the i newspaper as a \\"rising star\\" who could be re-appointed as shadow environment secretary or made shadow transport secretary if Starmer became leader of the Labour Party. Pollard remained in his post as shadow environment secretary's in Keir Starmer's Shadow Cabinet. ==Personal life== Pollard lives in Peverell in Plymouth with his partner, Sydney, who is a contemporary dancer.

He wrote \\"Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology\\", with a foreword by Ken Friedman, which was published and edited by University of Calgary Press in 1995. The Eternal Network and the Crackerjack Kid were mentioned in a review of mail art titled \\"Pushing the Envelope\\" in 2001, and the archivist and curator Judith Hoffberg wrote about him in her publication Umbrella. His awards include a Fulbright Grant and NEA Hilda Maehling Fellowship.Crackerjack Kid, a.k.a. Chuck Welch, mail artist, Photo self- portrait, 2-4-16 Ray Johnson and CrackerJack Kid, Feb 1984 Chuck Welch chose the pseudonym \\"CrackerJack Kid\\" because as a mail artist he went to the mail box each day never knowing what surprise he was going to find inside. Welch was first exposed to mail art through the exhibition Omaha Flow Systems curated by Ken Friedman at the Joslyn Art Museum in Nebraska in 1973, and he became actively involved in fluxus mail art in 1978. Welch was a member of Ray Johnson‚Äòs New York Correspondance School, also spelled \\"New York CorresponDance School\\". Both Welch and Johnson were in regular contact. Johnson kept mailing to Welch's daughter and referred to her as CrackerJack's Kid, and she became a mail artist, too. CrackerJackKid Envelope1984 Welch participated in the exhibition Flux Flags in Budapest, Hungary in 1992. In 1997 he had a solo exhibition in Guy Bleus ' E-Mail Art Archives, Center for Visual Arts in Hasselt, Belgium.P√™le-M√™le. Guy Bleus ‚Äì 42.292, ed. R. Gelad√©, N. Coninx & F. Bleus, Cultuurcentrum, Hasselt, 2010, p.128. He wrote about Fluxus and Ray Johnson, as well as about global art zines. ==Mail art networking== In a letter to mail artist Anna Banana, Welch wrote the treatise \\"Welch  Mail Art Archiving: Not Necessarily By the Letter.\\" Some CrackerJack Kid (Chuck Welch) correspondence is archived in the Oberlin College library's mail art collection. There was great dissension among mail artists about the mail art, performance art, xerographic art, and email art rules, origins and guidelines which sometimes were seen as too exclusionary, non-democratic, subversive, or elitist. Matt Ferranto wrote that \\"Some take a conceptual view of mail art. Chuck Welch, a prolific mail artist known as \\"The Crackerjack Kid\\" and editor of Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology, contends that 'information, communication aesthetics, and cultural motivation determine whether an artwork or artist fit within the complex Mail Art and Networking movements.\\" Conversely, others like Kornelia R√∂der, the co-editor of East Europe in International Network, explain the movement in political terms. \\"Mail art does not mean the personal correspondence between two persons,\\" writes R√∂der, but rather is 'the communication with art to projects arranged concretely which are often motivated by the socio-political context.'\\" ==Welch on mail art as a democratic forum== The Village Voice remarked on the \\"mail art mel√©e\\" which arose when the curator of a mail art show at Franklin Furnace did not include all the submissions to the exhibition. Matt Ferranto quoted Welch in reference to the medium's usual revolutionary stance and its art historical importance, \\"Mail art‚Ä¶(is) based on principles of free exchange and international access to all people, regardless of nationality, race, or creed,\\" says Chuck Welch, who also calls it \\"a democratic based forum existing outside traditional art systems.\\" Chuck Welch was a participating artist in the collaborative publications of the International Society of Copier Artists and was included in the I.S.C.A. Quarterly : Anniversary issue, Vol. 1 No. 4 (April 1983). Mail Art From Analog to Digital - The Electronic Museum of Mail Art In 1986, while pursuing his M.F.A. Degree at Boston Museum School and Tufts University, Welch began investigating the possibility of establishing a mail art presence on the global internet. In 1989, while at Dartmouth College, Welch frequented the Kiewit Computation Center where he learned HTML and established a direct bridge between the Internet (switched packet systems) and the analog mail art network. Welch organized a six-year project from 1991-1997 titled Telenetlink which included an Emailart Directory that was distributed via Artur Mattock's Reflux Network Project at the 1991 S√£o Paulo Biennial. Claire Voon said of Telenetlink, \\"The project naturally considers and is informed by the history of mail art, which emerged in the 1950s and ‚Äô60s from the Fluxus movement. Email art itself isn‚Äôt a novel concept, with roots in the 1990s: Chuck Welch, for one, who was part of Ray Johnson‚Äôs New York Correspondence School, was exploring connections between physical mail and the internet in his project Telenetlink. Mail art has long been appreciated as an alternative way to view and distribute art without relying on a physical exhibition space and dealing with the regulated structures of the art world\\". Hungarian critic and theoretician G√©za Perneczky wrote in THE MAGAZINE NETWORK that \\"milestones were set up in the field of telecommunication 'host systems\\" including Welch's \\"Telenetlink\\" (1991). Perneczky added, \\"Undeniably, Welch's initiative should be considered the most advanced link between the mail art network and the Global Telematic Community\\". In 1992, Welch created a Networker Databank at The University of Iowa's Alternative Traditions in the Contemporary Arts Archive and at the Museum of Modern Art . The Networker Databank functions as a repository for metadata documenting 180 worldwide events during the Decentralized Worldwide Networker Congresses. On January 1, 1995 Welch went online with mail art's first World Wide Web site known as EMMA - The Electronic Museum of Mail Art. Besides being the WWW's first virtual reality art museum with its library, research center, links, and galleries, EMMA included in its exhibition halls the first online mail art show dedicated to Ray Johnson who had passed away January 13, 1995. Welch wrote and recorded \\"The Ballad of Ray Johnson\\", a blues song that was embedded on the EMMA website weeks after Johnson's death by drowning. A second exhibition, titled \\"Cyberstamps\\", included the first exhibition of online digital Artistamps. ==His correspondence as an art medium== Chuck Welch was one of the few mail artists who sometimes used traditional etching techniques rather than rubber stamps or real stamps as imagery for his mail art. \\"During the late 1960s mail art contained illegal visa rubber stamps, false official stamps, and even fake passports page by page,\\" said Valery Oisteanu in \\"ILLEGAL MAIL ART (a poetical essay)\\" published in FLUE for Franklin Furnace. Welch's art is included in the mail art collection of the Getty Museum, and he is listed in the downloadable reference Google book ARTPOOL. In Networked Art, Craig Saper discusses Chuck Welch's \\"metamorphosis\\" project in terms of networking functions as an art medium, and the \\"craft\\" involved in mail-art \\"neither ornaments an interactive process nor makes a conceptual artwork pretty, but functions as conceptual art itself.\\" Welch's works ask \\"participants to remember stories related to personal and precious clothing, to construct a type of memorial to something precious that they have lost, and to build a community from these efforts.\\" Chuck Welch wrote in 1995, \\"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future.\\" == References  External links == * Welcome to Electronic Museum of Mail Art (EMMA): Crackerjack Kid's Guide to Mail Art.

He retained his seat in the 2019 general election. == Early life and education == Russell-Moyle was born on 14 September 1986 in Brighton, England. He was educated at Wallands Primary School, Priory School, Lewes, and Sussex Downs College. He studied at the University of Bradford and the University of Sussex. He worked at the National Youth Agency, chairing The Woodcraft Folk and as vice-president of the European Youth Forum based in Brussels. == Political career == Russell-Moyle in 2015 Russell-Moyle stood in the 2015 general election for the Lewes constituency, coming fourth. He was elected and served as a councillor on Brighton and Hove City Council in August 2016, before standing for and being elected as MP for Brighton Kemptown in 2017.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Re0vwI0PYk On 10 December 2018, Russell- Moyle was suspended from the House of Commons for the remainder of the day's sitting after he seized the ceremonial mace in protest at the government's eleventh-hour deferral of the vote on the EU Withdrawal Agreement, which had been scheduled for the following day. On 5 March 2019, Russell-Moyle joined thirteen other Labour MPs on Westminster Bridge, next to the Houses of Parliament, in a protest against Brexit under the banner 'Love Socialism Hate Brexit'. Russell-Moyle was one of a number of MPs to light red flares on the bridge. The use of flares so close to Westminster drew the attention of uniformed police, who arrived by boat to inquire what was taking place. During Prime Minister's Questions, on 20 March 2019, Russell-Moyle urged Prime Minister Theresa May to \\"condemn\\" Andrea Leadsom for the Cabinet Minister's comments on LGBT education. Leadsom had made comments on radio that parents should decide when their children are \\"exposed\\" to LGBT education. Leadsom's comments drew anger from many who felt, in Russell-Moyle's words, that \\"This is Conservative Party dog-whistle politics\\". Russell-Moyle also criticised the Prime Minister, pointing out that she had \\"campaigned to keep Section 28\\" which prevented the \\"promotion of homosexuality\\", which Russell-Moyle said had \\"led to millions of young people like myself growing in fear of being LGBT\\". Russell-Moyle was assaulted on the streets of his constituency, on 21 March 2019, whilst out showing support for demonstrators leafleting for 'The People's March', a demonstration in support of the People's Vote campaign. Russell-Moyle describes how an individual first began arguing with an ITV News crew suggesting that they were part of a \\"mainstream media conspiracy to stop Brexit\\". Russell-Moyle then approached the scene and explained that he was an MP and that \\"the majority of constituents had voted Remain\\", he describes that this information exacerbated the situation further with the individual describing MPs as \\"traitors\\" and lunging at him. The incident took place less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Theresa May gave a speech on Brexit in which she blamed MPs for deliberately delaying her attempt to ensure the UK left the EU by 29 March. In June 2019, Russell-Moyle was criticised by the Board of Deputies for hosting a Stop the War coalition meeting in Parliament to which a representative of the Yemeni Houthi group, Ahmed Alshami, had been invited.\\"Board of Deputies condemns Labour MP‚Äôs plan to host representative of antisemitic group in Parliament\\" 24 June 2019, https://www.thejc.com/news/uk- news/labour-mp-lloyd-russell-moyle-invites-representative-of-antisemitic- group-to-parliament-1.485737Daniel Sugarman. \\"Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle invites representative of antisemitic group to Parliament\\" Jewish Chronicle 24 June 2019, https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-mp-lloyd-russell-moyle- invites-representative-of-antisemitic-group-to-parliament-1.485737 The Board's Vice President stated that \\"hosting an organisation in the Houses of Parliament whose official slogan includes the phrase ‚Äòdeath to Israel, curse the Jews‚Äô is utterly unacceptable. Lloyd Russell-Moyle should immediately disavow his support for this event\\". Russell-Moyle described Alshami as \\"part of the delegation to the UN process...I support efforts to bring peace to Yemen, encouraging dialogue with people on all sides, however much I disagree with Mr Alshami [sic] views\\". Russell-Moyle later made his offer to host the meeting conditional on the non-participation of Alshami. Russell-Moyle was Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs. The Group launched an inquiry into \\"the Role and Sufficiency of Youth Work\\" in May 2018. Russell-Moyle highlighted the relevance and importance of the inquiry stating, \\"Over the years youth work has borne the brunt of significant spending cuts. Recent events and reports suggest the loss of youth work has had a negative impact on young people and communities\\". He was a member of several Select Committees during the 2017-2019 Parliament: * International Development Committee * Committees on Arms Export Controls, formerly Quadripartite Committee * International Development Sub-Committee on the Work of the Independent Commission for Aid Impact * Draft Registration of Overseas Entities Bill (joint) On 12 December 2019 Russell-Moyle was re-elected as a Labour MP to his Brighton Kemptown constituency. His speech on the night, which included an undertaking to \\"fight [the Tories] in ...the Parliament...the courts...the workplaces...the streets\\", aroused comment in the press and on social media. In December 2019, Russell-Moyle sparked controversy when he labelled anti- Corbyn Labour MPs as ‚Äúcunts‚Äù during an exchange on social media with a colleague, which was leaked to The Sun. Russell-Moyle was appointed Shadow Foreign Minister in January 2020 and took responsibility for the Americas and Caribbean, East Asia and the Pacific and the Overseas Territories. https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-13/debates/3C015023-C583-4D04-91DC-77AFC1994182/BritainInTheWorld?highlight=lloyd%20russell- moyle#contribution-9B00C93E-444F-42FD-B669-D73DEA60493A Upon the election of Keir Starmer as party leader, he was appointed as Shadow Minister for Natural Environment and Air Quality. In April 2020, Russell-Moyle was reported to have shared an unredacted version of a Labour Party dossier into the handling of antisemitism, which contained the names and details of whistle-blowers. In June 2020, he issued an apology after writing an article for Tribune in which he accused J. K. Rowling of using her experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault to justify discrimination against transgender people. On 16 July 2020, Russell-Moyle resigned from his frontbench role, citing a \\"campaign by the right-wing media\\" which he believes led to him and his staff receiving targeted abuse. Views Russell-Moyle has written in condemnation of the British government's policies on arms exports to countries such as Saudi Arabia for use in the conflict in Yemen. He supports the establishment of supervised injection sites in his constituency. Russell-Moyle was a supporter of the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. == Personal life == In November 2018, during a House of Commons debate to mark the 30th World AIDS Day, Russell- Moyle revealed he had been diagnosed as HIV positive a decade earlier, saying he wanted to tackle the stigma still associated with the condition and stating: \\"I have not only survived, I've prospered, and any partner I have is safe and protected\\", making reference later in his speech to having an undetectable viral load, as well as discussing pre-exposure prophylaxis and public health policy. In disclosing his HIV status in a Parliamentary speech, he became the first MP to do so in the chamber of the House of Commons and only the second person (after Chris Smith) to live openly with HIV as an MP. On 18 March 2020, Russell-Moyle announced that he had tested positive for Coronavirus disease 2019, becoming the third MP to be diagnosed with the disease.

It was a notable Conservative gain as Rowley defeated the sitting Labour MP Natascha Engel in a seat which had been represented by the Labour Party since 1935. ==Early life and career== Rowley was born in Scarsdale Hospital in Chesterfield. The son of a milkman, he grew up in Chesterfield and attended St Mary's High School. Rowley became the first member of his family to attend university in 1999, when he won an Exhibition to study Modern History at Lincoln College, Oxford. He then read for a master's degree, also in History, at the University of Manchester. Before becoming an MP, Rowley worked in financial services and management consultancy. He has held positions at Barclays, KPMG, Santander, and Co-op Insurance, where he was Head of Change at the time of his election to Parliament. Rowley had also contributed research on welfare and housing to the centre-right think tank, the Centre for Social Justice. ==Westminster councillor== Aged 26, Rowley was elected as a Conservative councillor in May 2006 for the Maida Vale ward on Westminster City Council in London. He was re- elected in May 2010 and was appointed as Cabinet Member for parking and transportation. Rowley was transferred to a new role as Cabinet Member for Community Services in January 2012. He stood down as a Councillor and Cabinet Member in Westminster in May 2014 to focus on seeking election as an MP. As the Cabinet Member for parking at the Council, Rowley was tasked with implementing the council's policy to expand evening and weekend parking restrictions, which the Council argued was to improve traffic congestion and pollution, but critics argued was partly for income generation. The policy was supported by some residents, as well as environmental and disability campaigners, but was criticised by some local residents, business owners and religious groups. The plans were dropped when its architect, council leader Colin Barrow, resigned. As Cabinet Member for community services Rowley received positive national media coverage for a merger of library management across the London councils of Westminster, Hammersmith & Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea. The councils and Rowley said it resulted in significant financial savings, ensured all libraries stayed open across the three councils while retaining front-line staff, and gave residents access to one million books. Working with the Groundwork Federation Rowley also helped oversee a new environmental area that opened up a previously closed part of Paddington Recreation Ground. ==Member of Parliament== Rowley stood unsuccessfully in the 2010 General Election as the Conservative candidate for Bolsover, where he came second to Dennis Skinner. He stood again at the 2015 general election as the Conservative candidate for North East Derbyshire, again coming second, but reducing the sitting Labour MP Natascha Engel's majority to under 2,000 votes. He was subsequently elected as the MP for North East Derbyshire at the 2017 general election with a majority of 2,861. The result was notable as it made Rowley the first Conservative MP for the seat since 1935. In Parliament, Rowley currently serves on the Public Accounts Committee. He is Chair of an All Party Parliamentary Group, which he set up, investigating the impact of shale gas fracking, and Vice-Chair of an APPG on Ovarian Cancer. Along with fellow Conservative MP Luke Graham, Rowley helped set up and is Co-Chair of 'Freer', an initiative of the right leaning think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs. The group aims to promote a freer society and freer economy, through liberal economic and social policies. When interviewed in June 2017 by the Financial Times, Rowley said that he had voted for Brexit at the 2016 referendum, but had not actively campaigned for it. The paper suggested that it appeared 'he had deleted social media posts relating to the referendum period that might reveal how he had voted'. He is not a member but has supported positions taken by the European Research Group ‚Äì the primary Eurosceptic lobbying group within Parliament, currently chaired by Steve Baker ‚Äì and was one of a number of Conservative MPs to publicly oppose Theresa May's Chequers proposal. Rowley has obtained government support for the Staveley By- pass, a dual carriageway by-pass of Brimington, Staveley and Mastin Moor that has been planned since 1927. In October 2019, Rowley proposed the loyal address following the Queen's Speech. He increased his majority from 2,861 to 12,876 at the 2019 general election. ==Fracking== Rowley's constituency includes six oil and gas licence blocks, all awarded to chemical firm Ineos by the Oil and Gas Authority under the 14th licensing round in 2015. There are plans for four shale wells, one hrz frac well and 2D and 3D seismic surveying. Rowley has actively campaigned against planning applications in his own constituency for fracking operations. He has also argued against his party's efforts to reduce delays in approving schemes. Rowley argued that the specific Marsh Lane application was wrong in terms of content, location and timing, arguing the rural setting was not right for industrial activity. He stated that he would support concerned residents, oppose it and put his own objections against it to Derbyshire County Council. Rowley was also reported to have had a fiery clash with an Ineos barrister when giving evidence in opposition to the planning application by INEOS for Marsh Lane. Although opposing one specific application for a site in his constituency, he has said on fracking in general: \\"I am willing to look at fracking long term and to look at new ways of producing energy long term if they can be proven to be safe and efficient and effective for the country.\\" It was reported in the national media that, at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2018, he argued his party's support for fracking could see them lose a future general election, due to the unpopularity of the process in local areas. ==Personal life== Rowley is openly gay. Before his election, he worked as a Senior Manager for an insurance company. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Lincoln College, Oxford Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:People from Chesterfield Category:LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"Lee Rowley"},{"id":"54258795","text":"Charalambos \\"Bambos\\" Charalambous (born 2 December 1967) is a British Labour Party politician.

He was re-elected at the general election in December 2019 with an increased vote and majority. He lives near Brighstone on the Isle of Wight. ==Early life and career== Seely was educated in north London at Arnold House School and Harrow School.  Journalism, policy and media  From 1990 to 1994, Seely worked as a foreign correspondent in Eastern Europe as a stringer for The Times newspaper. He first visited what was then the USSR in early 1990, witnessing the first celebrations of Easter in western Ukraine since Soviet occupation after World War II, and also early Chernobyl disaster protests in Kiev that year. He filed an initial batch of reports and was invited by the newspaper to return permanently from 1990 to 1994. During his tenure in the country, Seely reported from most of the republics or new nations: Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia (including Nagorny Karabakh), Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. During this time, he made visits to the Balkans, including Sarajevo and Kosovo. He also wrote occasional articles for The Spectator and The Sunday Times. In the final year in the former USSR, Seely became a Special Correspondent for The Washington Post'. He then spent a year in the United States writing a book, Deadly Embrace, on Russia's role in the Caucasus. During this time, he was a fellow at Brown University's Watson Institute. He returned to the UK to work for the Associated Press as a London-based reporter. In 2000 Seely moved briefly into politics. He worked at Conservative Central Office, heading up the foreign affairs team for Francis Maude; and he also worked briefly for Michael Howard and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. From 2005 to 2008 Seely worked for MTV Networks International.  Military  From 2008 onwards, Seely served in the UK Armed Forces. He was mobilised or placed on Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) for nearly a decade until his selection as a parliamentary candidate in the 2017 election, at which time he resigned his full-time service and returned to the Army Reserve. He served on four UK operations: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and ISIS. As a British Army Captain, he was awarded a Joint Commanders Commendation in 2009 for his tour of Iraq and a Military MBE in the 2016 Operational Awards and Honours List. He has since been commissioned.  Academia  Seely has been a research associate at the Changing Character of War Programme at the University of Oxford. He has contributed to the King's College War Studies blog, Oxford Politics Department blog, The Washington Post's social sciences blog, Prospect magazine and RUSI Journal, published by the Royal United Services Institute. ==Political career== Seely's political career began as a personal assistant to Shaun Woodward, until Woodward's defection to the Labour Party in 1999. Following this he worked at Conservative Central Office as an adviser of foreign affairs to Michael Howard, Francis Maude and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. Elections Seely at the 2017 General Election count at his Isle of wight constituency In 2005, Seely stood at the Broxtowe constituency but lost to the sitting Labour MP Nick Palmer by 2,296 votes. In 2013, he was voted to represent Central Wight on the Isle of Wight Council for the Conservatives and retained the seat in 2017. After the decision by sitting Conservative MP Andrew Turner to stand down at the 2017 general election, Seely was selected as the candidate for the Isle of Wight seat and gained 38,190 votes, representing 51.3% of the vote. He previously worked with Turner on the One Wight campaign, acting as campaign co-ordinator, in 2010. During his campaign, he suggested that were he to be elected, he would campaign for improvements to the Island Line rail network. He resigned as a county Councillor in late 2017. Seely is the sixth member of his paternal family to become a Member of Parliament, and the second to become the Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight.  In Parliament  Since entering Parliament Seely has spoken in 37 debates - which is average in comparison to other MPs. In his maiden speech, he called for a better deal for the Isle of Wight from Government. Seely's speeches, in Hansard, are readable by an average 17‚Äì18 year old, going by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Levelscore. Seely's first vote as a Member of Parliament took place on 28 June 2017, where he voted against removing the pay cap for police and fire services. This was deemed controversial by some following his comments during his election campaign where he praised the emergency services following the fire at Grenfell Tower. On 12 July 2017 Seely established the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) to promote the interests of islands around the UK to encourage MPs and Peers from all political parties to join together to lobby government for their respective islands. The group has engaged on a number of issues that affect islands, including healthcare, local government funding and supporting Island economies. He has called or participated in three separate Westminster Hall Parliamentary debates focusing on island issues, as part of the UK Islands APPG. Seely was appointed the position of Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Ministerial team at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in January 2019. On 16 July 2019 Seely resigned from this position following his decision to vote against Government over HS2. On 31 May 2019, Seely wrote an article for CapX stating that he was supporting Michael Gove in his bid to become leader of the Conservative Party. In the 2019 general election, the Isle of Wight re-elected Seely as their Member of Parliament with an increased majority. Seely secured 56.2% of the votes cast.  Committees and foreign affairs  In February 2018, he was elected by his Conservative colleagues to sit on the cross-party Foreign Affairs Select Committee, whose remit is to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). In July 2018 Seely was elected to the Committees on Arms Export Controls. In September 2018, in an article for ConservativeHome, Seely outlined the 10 measures the Security Minister Ben Wallace should consider in order to respond to and deter the \\"subversive activities of Russia\\". These included: creating a small, permanent multi-agency group to understand and expose foreign subversive activities, introduce a UK Foreign Agents Act to ensure PR agencies, reputation management firms and others who work as agents for foreign states are listed as such, changes to the UK visa regime, strengthen OFCOM powers and a Royal Commission to understand the threat to our electoral system by cyber infiltration and fake news. In October 2018, Seely hosted a press conference in parliament, in conjunction with the online investigative journalist website Bellingcat, to announce the identity of the second Skripal assassin suspect. He writes for The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Guardian, and the online sites ConservativeHome, CapX and the Spectator online on foreign affairs.  Island Manifesto  Seely's manifesto, A Vision for the Island, was published a year after he entered parliament, in July 2018. In it, Seely sets out how he believes that the Isle of Wight should develop over the coming decades. He outlines his top-ten goals as being to: * Deliver increased numbers of genuinely affordable housing for Islanders, and especially young Islanders. * At the same time, protect the landscape, severely limiting green field development and speculative development outside built-up areas * Raise primary and secondary education standards, have fewer but better sixth forms and develop a higher education facility and campus * Improve the integration of health and social care, ensure that the NHS on the Island is on a secure footing * Use arts to drive inspiration, aspiration, education and regeneration * Develop public transport (cycle and rail) * Develop the Island's digital infrastructure and economy as part of a drive to attract high-quality jobs * Encourage the ferry firms to support the Island better * Improve the Island's visitor offer and develop high-quality tourism * Extend the land covered by the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designation and look seriously at whether the Island should become a national park Global Britain Study On 11 February 2019, Seely co-authored a report on British foreign policy, post-Brexit, Global Britain: A Twenty-First Century Vision. In it, Seely and co-author James Rogers recommended a restructuring of overseas policy. The recommendations were: * Establish a National Strategy Council to oversee a National Global Strategy to better integrate the work of the FCO and MoD, among other parts of government. * Integrate the Department of International trade and the Department for International Development into the FCO as agencies to improve integration in Whitehall. * Structure British global policy around the promotion of three great, fundamental freedoms: Freedom for Trade, Freedom from Oppression, and Freedom of Thought. * Strengthen greater cooperation with Australia, Canada and New Zealand (the so- called \\"CANZUK\\" group). * Champion the international order by greater investment in the United Nations. * Redefine the definition of international aid to allow the UK to fund an expanded BBC World Service and all Ministry of Defence peacekeeping operations.  Russian Hybrid Warfare  In a June 2018, Seely produced once of the few comprehensive definitions of Russian hybrid war, in a paper entitled: \\"A Definition of Contemporary Russian Conflict: how does the Kremlin Wage War?\\" The peer reviewed paper was produced by the Henry Jackson Society and presented in an event in the House of Commons on 4 June. Seely used the term \\"Contemporary Russian Conflict\\" to describe both the overt and covert forms of influence used by the Kremlin. He described modern Russian conflict as \\"a sophisticated and integrated form of state influence closely linked to political objectives. It has, at its core, the KGB toolkit of 'Active Measures' ‚Äì political warfare ‚Äì around which has been wrapped a full spectrum of state tools.\\" In waging this form of conflict, Seely argued that Russia uses at least 50 specific tools and methods. The report was denounced by the Russian state broadcaster, RT, which described the report as an ‚Äúattempt to foster Russophobia by publishing anti-Kremlin propaganda masquerading as a peer-reviewed study. Investigation into Huawei On 16 May 2019, Seely co-authored a first investigation into the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its possible role in the development of 5G. The report, published in the Henry Jackson Society, was also authored by Peter Varnish and John Hemmings. It recommended barring Huawei from involvement in the UK's 5G infrastructure network. The report was endorsed by Sir Richard Dearlove, who led MI6 between 1999 and 2004, and former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The investigation concluded: * Huawei was subordinate to China's 2017 National Intelligence Law and was obliged to assist China's intelligence agencies in operations, research and development. Despite claims to the contrary, it would be likely to be compelled to act in Beijing's interests by the CCP leadership. * Huawei's claims to be a private company are highly problematic, as it is 98% owned by a trade union committee. Huawei acts like ‚Äì and is treated like ‚Äì a state-owned enterprise by Chinese state- banks. * Huawei has on many occasions been accused of having an active or passive role in espionage and has worked with Chinese security forces in Xinjiang province, where many individuals are under surveillance or in re- education camps. * Huawei should be treated as a high-risk vendor. The report featured high on the news on the day of launch, including as one of the lead items on the BBC News.  Surkov Leaks Report  In July 2019, Seely co- authored a report into Surkov Leaks with Aliya Shandra. The report was entitled \\"The Surkov Leaks: The Inner Workings of Russia‚Äôs Hybrid War in Ukraine\\".  Breaking the China Supply Chain report  Seely contributed to an April 2020 study examining the strategic trade dependency on China of the ‚ÄòFive Eyes‚Äô group of nations: UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand The report was covered in The Times on 14 May 2020. The report coincided with a letter written by Seely and a group of UK Conservative MPs to request the Government be legally required to update Parliament annually on the UK‚Äôs strategic trade dependency on China and potentially other nations. The letter ‚Äî which cited the Henry Jackson Society report ‚Äî was signed by 21 MPs. Coronavirus pandemic In early May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced that a contact-tracing app would be trialled on the Isle of Wight, a move strongly supported by Seely and for which he lobbied Government. Prior to the lockdown, Seely spoke on several occasions to warn Ministers about the need for additional thought to ensure the emergency supply of the Island and threatened to amend legislation unless the Government acted. Shortly after, the Department of Transport, following work by Seely, the Isle of Wight Council and the Island‚Äôs Transport Infrastructure Board, announced an emergency package to support the Island. The app launch was successful, with tens of thousands downloading the app in the initial period, although some of which were from people off-island. Seely believed that after three weeks or so of the app‚Äôs use on the Island, approximately 55,000 Islanders had downloaded it out of 80,000 Islanders who were able to download the app, equating to a success rate of approximately 70 percent. In a subsequent article in the Conservative online site, Conservative Home, Seely argued that working with central Government to pilot national schemes was the best way to ensure the Isle of Wight was able to be at the cutting edge of innovative tech to improve quality of life on the Island, especially in healthcare. He cited the use of drones to supply St Mary‚Äôs Hospital and money for the Island‚Äôs telemedicine project. It subsequently emerged that on 22 May Seely had dropped into a small gathering in the village of Seaview to speak with Freddy Gray, deputy editor of The Spectator. Seely explained that he had done so to chat with Gray regarding a previous article by Grey on the app, but immediately apologised for his error of judgement. On 11 June The Times quoted Seely in a report that the NHS app may have had a role in suppressing the virus on the Isle of Wight. Seely told his local County Press newspaper that the analysis needed more research to ensure its accuracy. ‚ÄúIn blunt terms,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthis is the best evidence we may get that the app saved lives of Islanders,‚Äù Seely told the County Press. On the same day, Seely spoke on a House of Commons debate on zoos, welcoming their reopening following the Covid-19 lockdown, and urging the UK Government to support zoos and animal sanctuaries on the Island. ==Personal life== Seely was born to an English father and German mother, and was educated in London at Arnold House School and Harrow. He comes from a family long involved in politics on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere in the country. Seely's great-great-uncle, General Jack Seely, was MP for the Isle of Wight between 1900 and 1906 and again between 1923 and 1924, in between which time he served in the First World War ‚Äì including leading one of the last great cavalry charges in history at the Battle of Moreuil Wood on his war horse Warrior. Seely lives in the west of the Isle of Wight near the village of Brighstone. He is a keen swimmer and has swum the Solent twice for charity, most recently in August 2018 to raise funds for the West Wight Sports and Community Centre. Seely is a strong supporter of LGBT rights. In July 2018 Seely took part in the parade for Isle of Wight Pride, where he was joined by Conchita Wurst. In an interview with Pink News following the event, Seely stated that he felt that \\"for dictators, gays are the new Jews.\\" On 30 December 2018 Seely wrote an article for Conservative Home expressing his concern over the Chinese state ownership of the dating app Grindr, stating that \\"The Chinese state very likely now has access to highly sensitive sexual information relating to the 3.1 million people who date on it daily.\\" Seely is a keen guitar player and in an article in Politics Home in March 2019 was noted as having an acoustic guitar on hand to play whilst in his Westminster office. In the same article Seely was quoted as saying that \\"representing the island is like being married to the right woman\\". == Bibliography == * War and Humanitarian Action in Chechnya (Occasional paper) (Thomas J.

Herse (Ancient Greek:·ºùœÅœÉŒ∑ means \\"dew\\") was a figure in Greek mythology, daughter of Cecrops, sister to Aglauros and Pandrosos.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.2.6 Cephalus of Athens is the son of Hermes and Herse who suffers a tragic ending to his happy marriage with Procris.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.15.1Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.675-863 == Mythology ==  Erichthonius  According to the Bibliotheca, when Hephaestus unsuccessfully attempted to rape Athena, she wiped his semen off her leg with wool and threw it on the ground, impregnating Gaia. Athena wished to make the resulting infant Erichthonius immortal and to raise it, so she gave it to three sisters, Herse, Aglauros and Pandrosos, in a willow basket and warned them to never open it. Aglauros and Herse disobeyed her and opened the basket which contained the infant and future king, Erichthonius, who was somehow mixed or intertwined with a snake. The sight caused Herse and Aglauros to go insane and they jumped to their deaths off the Acropolis. Shrines were constructed for Herse and Aglauros on the Acropolis.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.14.6Hyginus, Fabulae 166 Les Filles de C√©crops d√©couvrant l'enfant √ârichthonios by Jacob Jordaens (1617) An alternative version of the story is that, while Athena was gone bringing a limestone mountain from the Pallene peninsula to use in the Acropolis, the sisters, minus Pandrosos again, opened the box with Erichthonius inside. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now Mt. Lykabettos). Once again, Herse and Aglauros went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off the cliffs of the Acropolis. This story supposedly inspired an ancient ritual in Athens: \\"The Festival of the Dew Carriers\\" or Arrhephoria.  Jealous sister  Some authors, such as Ovid in his Metamorphoses and Ars Amatoria, wrote a different end for Herse and Aglauros. Ovid tells in Book 2 of his Metamorphoses that Erichthonius was born without a mother. Pallas Athena (better known as Athena, Minerva is her Roman name) placed him in a willow basket and told the sisters not to look on the mysteries. Two daughters, Herse and Pandrosos obeyed, but Aglauros looked and saw the child lying next to a great snake. Cornix, the crow, told Athena, who turned her feathers from white to black for her pains. Later in Book 2, Hermes (Mercury in Roman mythology) is in Athens and sees a festival to Athena. He falls in love with Herse and goes to her house to ask for her hand. Aglauros agrees to give Herse his message for the price of gold. Athena sees all of this and goes to the house of Envy and orders the goddess to poison Aglauros. Aglauros, who begins to waste away with jealousy, blocks the passage to Herse's room and refuses to move. Hermes, angry at Aglauros for breaking her promise, changes her into a black marble statue.Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.708-832 == Gallery == File:Erichthonius Released from His Basket LACMA 65.37.98.jpgErichthonius Released from His Basket by Antonio Tempesta (1606) File:Jakob Jordaens 015.jpgDaughters of Kekrops Finding Erichthonios by Jacob Jordaens (1640) File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Discovery of the Child Erichthonius - WGA20295.jpgThe Discovery of the Child Erichthonius by Peter Paul Rubens (circa 1615) File:Pierre, Jean-Baptiste Marie - Mercury, Herse and Aglauros - 1763.jpgMercury, Herse and Aglauros by Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre (1763) File:Rubens, Peter Paul - Finding of Erichthonius - 1632-1633.jpgFinding of Erichthonius by Peter Paul Rubens (between 1632 and 1633) File:Willem van Herp Erichthonius.jpgThe finding of the infant Erichthonius by Cecrops's daughters by Willem van Herp (circa 1650)) File:Caraglio Voyeurism.jpgMercury and Herse from the series ‚ÄúG√∂tterlieben‚Äù (Prinmaking), Hamburg. == Notes  References == * Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae from The Myths of Hyginus translated and edited by Mary Grant.

One year later, Brereton stood again for the City Council and successfully retained the Baddeley, Milton and Norton ward for the Conservative Party. Following the local election in May 2015, in which he was re-elected as a councillor, he became cabinet member for Regeneration, Heritage and Transport on the City Council as part of a Conservative/Independents ruling coalition.

He attracted some negative publicity for a mailshot his campaign released which made false claims about the voting record of the two local Labour MPs and for a poster that misspelled Brexit. After the Government announced that there would be a General Election taking place in June 2017, the Conservative Campaign Headquarters told the local Conservative Association to choose Brereton from a list of one, after he was promoted by his boss, the Cabinet Minister Karen Bradley. This was at the expense of Joe Rich, who had added four per cent to the Conservative Party vote share when he stood in the constituency in 2015 and had hoped to stand again. Brereton went on to defeat the sitting Labour MP Rob Flello and take the seat on 9 June 2017, making him the first Conservative to win in the constituency in over 80 years.

It is the third and final novel in Kwan's \\"Crazy Rich...\\" trilogy that looks at the rich and powerful families of Singapore. It was preceded by the bestsellers of Crazy Rich Asians in 2013 and China Rich Girlfriend in 2015. ==Plot== In 2015, two years after the events that take place in China Rich Girlfriend, Nick and Rachel Young (n√©e Chu), an economics professor at New York University (NYU), are happily married and living their life in Manhattan. Nick is informed by his mother Eleanor that his grandmother, Su Yi, has had a heart attack, and that he must come home to reconcile with her before she dies. While Nick wants to make up with his grandmother out of guilt for having shut her out of his life for marrying Rachel (as Su Yi was opposed to the marriage), his mother wants him to make amends so that he will be re- introduced into the will and inherit Tyersall Park, Su Yi's home. The extended Shang-Young clan has descended upon Tyersall Park to say their last goodbyes with the hopes of getting into Su Yi's good graces and inheriting part of her fortune. Nick is initially prevented from seeing Su Yi due to scheming from his cousin Eddie Cheng, who believes he has a shot at inheriting his grandmother's estate. Eddie lies and convinces the entire family and house staff that Su Yi does not wish to see Nick while she is on her deathbed. With the help of the head of security, the head maid (who overheard Eddie's plotting) and Astrid, Nick is able to sneak into Tyersall Park and speak with his grandmother while she is in a cardiac intensive care unit in her bedroom. She is happy to see him and they make amends. Meanwhile, Astrid, Nick's cousin, becomes engaged again to Charlie Wu. Her relationship with Charlie faces obstacles from Charlie's scorned ex-wife Isabel Wu and Astrid's soon-to- be ex-husband Michael Teo. Astrid receives a grainy video depicting her and Charlie having sex in his bedroom from Michael, with a threat of releasing the video unless he is given 5 billion dollars in their divorce settlement. The video is released by Isabel just before she attempts suicide. Astrid is shunned by her family and retreats into seclusion, not even telling Charlie where she went. He goes to great lengths to track her down, eventually finding her on an island in the Philippines. He reveals to her that he has gotten Michael to sign off on their divorce without any challenge by threatening to have him prosecuted for illegal surveillance of Astrid and blackmail. He tells her that though Isabel survived her suicide attempt and is now in stable condition, her family had found out that she was involved in blackmailing Astrid with Michael and that she will face humiliation of her own. Astrid says that she wants to stay and to bring her son Cassian to live with the people on the island. Charlie is willing to let her have the life she wants but wants to know if there is any room for him. Su Yi dies and everyone prepares for her funeral. In her will, she leaves a share of Tyersall Park to each of her four daughters (Alexandra, Felicity, Victoria, and Catherine) and her son (Phillip, Nick's father) along with a share to Nick and his cousin (and Eddie's brother) Alistair Cheng. Upon the reading of the will, Eddie is humiliated to be left with nothing except his grandfather's antique sapphire cuff links. Astrid inherits Su Yi's fashionable dresses and jewelry. Jacqueline, Su Yi's goddaughter, inherits her shares at Ling Holdings, making her a wealthy woman and angering the family, who expected to inherit some of those shares, and now only have Tyersall Park. Returning to Tyersall Park, Eddie furiously confronts Fiona for humiliating him by not telling him about the contents of the will, and ruining their family's opportunity to live in luxury. Fiona claims that she respected Su Yi's privacy and that she only picked up the pen to sign the paper as a witness. Eddie ends up curled up in a ball, crying, with Fiona comforting him. The family initially agrees to sell Tyersall Park to Jack Bing, to be used by his new wife Kitty, the former Hong Kong soap actress (and Alistair's former fianc√©e), for 10 billion dollars, because there are no funds to maintain it. Nick cannot bring himself to let Tyersall Park go, and so he attempts to buy out the shares owned by his four aunts, with his father signing over his portion directly to Nick. However, he is not able to raise the money to do this. Nick takes a trip to visit an elderly Thai prince, based on a note left to him by his grandmother, thinking that this is the key to the funding to buy Tyersall Park. However he learns that this Prince was his grandmother's first love, and Aunt Catherine's biological father. Nick also learns that during World War II, Su Yi aided in the resistance effort against the Japanese occupation of Singapore by providing Tyersall Park as a safe haven for many Chinese and British agents working against the Japanese. Nick then tries to block the sale of Tyersall Park by claiming that it is a historic site. Rachel and Nick bring together Nick's friends Colin and Araminta Khoo, Rachel's friend Goh Peik Lin, and Alistair to buy Tyersall Park and turn it into the Tyersall Museum and Hotel. Kitty completes the deal by becoming a secret investor in their group in order to spite Jack, who had decided to buy Tyersall Park for Colette (his daughter) instead of Kitty. One year later, Peik Lin is marrying Alistair, with Nick and Rachel serving as best man and maid of honor. After years of trying to conceive, Araminta and Colin now have a two-month-old son. Eddie finally changes his ways after Fiona convinces him to seek help and he goes to a therapist. Astrid continues to live on the island with Charlie and has started designing her own clothes. She does not wish to get married yet, instead preferring to live \\"a life of sin\\" with Charlie, enjoys the fact that this very much bothers her parents. Rachel reveals to Nick that she is six weeks pregnant. They both jokingly agree to not tell Nick's mother about the news, agreeing to wait at least until their child is 21. ==Writing== Kwan has said that this book was actually the first he had mapped out when he was first planning his trilogy. ==Characters== * Rachel Young (n√©e Chu): Married to Nick Young.

This was the first series of a new podcast network for Comedy Central. ==Reception== In a mixed review of the show for The Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Fienberg wrote that \\"What The Jim Jefferies Show needs is to stop trying to be like the other kids and to start trying to be like Jim Jefferies.\\" Mike Hale of the New York Times also gave the show a mixed review, writing that \\"As a late-night host, Mr. Jefferies can appear to be doing nothing much, but there‚Äôs a tricky balancing act going on between his ordinary-bloke persona and his sometimes savagely raunchy punch lines. The results are hit and miss, and sometimes it‚Äôs a long while between hits.\\" However, Hale also praised Jefferies for occasionally delivering \\"explosive\\" lines in the show. The first season ended with Jefferies listed in Variety's \\"Fresh Voices in TV Who Broke Out in 2017\\" and the writing team nominated for Best Comedy/Variety Talk Series at the 2018 Writers Guild of America Awards. ==Cancellation== On November 6, 2019, Comedy Central announced the show had been canceled, but would air an additional two weeks of the series, with the last show to be broadcast on November 19, 2019.Jefferies Show Canceled; November 6, 2019; webpage; The Wrap online (thewrap.com); accessed January 11, 2020 ==Episodes== Season 1 (2017) Season 2 (2018) Season 3 (2019) == References  External links == * * Category:2017 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:2010s American political comedy television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:American news parodies Category:Comedy Central late-night programming Category:Comedy Central original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Political satirical television series ","title":"The Jim Jefferies Show"},{"id":"54259123","text":"Charles Douglas Blex (born December 19, 1946) is an American politician.

It is one of the eleven hundreds of the County of Adelaide. It was named in 1846 by Governor Frederick Robe probably deriving from a Kaurna/Ngarrindjeri place label willannga, meaning place of green trees. The hundred is bounded on the north by the Onkaparinga River and includes part of the McLaren Vale wine region. The bounds of the Hundred of Willunga span the southern half of the contemporary City of Onkaparinga local government area, including localities south of the Onkaparinga and west of Kangarilla and Kuitpo. ==Local government== The District Council of Willunga was established in 1853 to govern the hundred. By 1856, residents on the northern boundary at Noarlunga had seceded from the council along with parts of Morphett Vale over the Onkaparinga River to form the District Council of Noarlunga. The following year, residents of Aldinga successfully lobbied for their own independent local governance and the District Council of Aldinga was formed. In 1932 Aldinga was dissolved and the land absorbed back into Willunga council. In 1997 Willunga council was amalgamated with Noarlunga and Happy Valley councils to the north to form the City of Onkaparinga, spanning both the Hundred of Willunga and Hundred of Noarlunga. ==Towns and other localities== The following Adelaide seaside suburbs and semi-urban localities are located within the hundred: * Port Noarlunga South * Seaford Meadows * Seaford * Moana * Old Noarlunga (south of Onkaparinga River) * Seaford Rise * Seaford Heights * Maslin Beach * Port Willunga * Aldinga Beach * Sellicks Beach The following semi-rural towns and localities are located within the hundred: * Blewitt Springs * McLaren Vale * McLaren Flat * Tatachilla * The Range (north-western half) * Aldinga * Whites Valley * Willunga * Sellicks Hill * Willunga South ==See also== *Lands administrative divisions of South Australia ==References== Willunga ","title":"Hundred of Willunga"},{"id":"54259195","text":"Larry Campbell (born February 20, 1951) is an American politician.

In 2017 she defeated the incumbent Conservative Edward Timpson by 48 votes. == Early life and career == Smith attended Brine Leas School in Nantwich, Cheshire and South Cheshire College in Crewe. She went on to study at Crewe campus of Manchester Metropolitan University, qualifying as a school teacher. After being disheartened by education becoming \\"totally focused on results, Ofsted inspections, a packed Curriculum and targets, targets, targets\\", Smith founded a tutoring business, called One-to-One Learning UK, based in Nantwich, where she worked with hundreds of schoolchildren in the local area, including pupils studying to pass Independent school entrance exams and the Eleven-plus. == Political career == Smith was involved in the campaign against school funding cuts in Cheshire East. She told the Crewe Chronicle: \\"I sat at home after going to a public meeting at Brine Leas School\\" about proposed education cuts \\"and I decided enough was enough regarding the funding for schools and I posted something on Facebook. From that, I got involved with the fairer funding\\". Smith was announced as the Labour Party candidate for the Crewe and Nantwich constituency in the snap 2017 general election on 1 May 2017. She launched her campaign on 3 May, saying \\"What ordinary people need are decent well-paid jobs and greater job security. In this race locally, I am the only candidate committed to that.\\" She also said that she was not a \\"natural-born politician\\" and promised to be a \\"different sort of MP if elected that remains accessible and up front with her constituents\\". In the election, Smith defeated incumbent Conservative junior minister Edward Timpson by 48 votes, overturning a majority of 3,620. She declared that the result \\"sent a message to the establishment and the elite\\", the seat having been held by the Conservatives in elections since Gwyneth Dunwoody died in 2008. The seat saw a 3.7% swing to Labour, and an increase in turnout of 3%, to just under 70%. On 13 June 2018, Smith and five other Labour MPs resigned their roles as frontbenchers for the Labour Party in protest at Labour's Brexit position. Leader Jeremy Corbyn had instructed his MPs to abstain in a vote which Britain would remain in the single market by joining the European Economic Area (EEA). Following her resignation Smith voted against the EEA. Smith also resigned her position as a Shadow Cabinet Office Minister. However, despite this stance, Smith abstained from a vote to delay the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union for a time sufficient to enable a second referendum on leaving the EU to be held. In September 2018 Smith called for a general strike to \\"topple\\" Theresa May's Conservative government. Deputy Labour Leader, Tom Watson, quickly distanced the Labour Party from Smith saying her comments were \\"not particularly helpful\\". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey added: \\"Just to make it perfectly clear a general strike is not Labour Party policy.\\" Smith lost her seat in the 2019 general election, to Kieran Mullan of the Conservative Party. The Labour vote was down 9.7% to 37.4% and the Conservative vote up 6.1% to 53.1% giving Kieran Mullan a majority of 8,508. In January 2020 Smith appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to speak about her life since losing the election, and to dispel what she described as \\"the misconception... that people who are members of parliament ‚Äì even local councillors ‚Äì are kind of sitting on a bank of reserves or will automatically have connections who will come and want to hire you\\". The interview came after Smith was photographed at her local job centre. On 27 February 2020, Smith was elected to Cheshire East Council for the Crewe South ward. ==Political views== Smith identifies as a socialist and was part of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs during her time in parliament. She is a supporter of the Labour Against Private Schools campaign, which aims to abolish independent schools in the United Kingdom. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Alumni of Manchester Metropolitan University Category:People educated at Brine Leas School Category:People educated at South Cheshire College Category:21st- century British women politicians Category:Schoolteachers from Cheshire Category:English socialists ","title":"Laura Smith (politician)"},{"id":"54259229","text":"Marchbank is an English surname.

It lies south east of the Helambu Village Council in Sindhupalchok District. Shermathang is a village located exactly at the altitude of 2,621 meters from the sea level and the Chhimi gaon is somewhat in lower height. Helambu is the one of the biggest Rural Municipality of the district. Being specific to a locality, Shermathang, a village of Helambu, is in the northernmost part of the rural municipality surrounded by Chhimi, Thangpaldhap, Bhotang, Chitre, Kakane, Kieul and other villages of the district. Shermahtnag is on the lap of the mountain just below the forest area of Langtang National Park (LNP). It is accessible by graveled roads from the main bazaar Melamchi and the capital city Kathmandu these days and have frequent bus service in winter days. Shermathang is a village, situated in the upper high hill of the northern part of Helambu rural municipality. There were a total of about 4 dozens of households and some hundreds of people in the village. One shopkeeper named Pema dai in Shermathang told, due course of an interview that ‚Äì \\"they even sometimes feel the goods brought by Tibet are of good quality. For the Tibetan tea (also called salt and butter tea or Chuchya in Hyolmo) to be made tea leaves is brought from Tibet otherwise the local tea grains cannot give a good taste.\\" They do have such trust and belief over goods from Tibet their daily behaviour and their thought are being influenced by the Tibet mania. For other life process like getting education also they do have a belief on Tibet productions. Not only Tibetan in thir original land they believe Tibetan in refugee and in diaspora. In his article O‚ÄôNeill mentions one petty capitalist from Helambu sent a son to become a Buddhist acolyte in a Tibetan refugee monastery in South India, subsidized by profits from carpet production. The families that reside in Shermathang are equally involved in tourism business and in agriculture plus foreign work of some family members. But when it is calculated with their total population it gives the normal calculation to sum up the centum value. Some people who are newly migrated in the city areas have not totally left their agricultural practice. Since they are involved in other profession like service and working abroad they are still trying their destiny in governmental service since there is a provision of reservation for ethnic groups. Some people who are residing in city areas for long time are already involved in other occupation other than business and their agriculture practice in their ancestral village. In such cases for those families, their farm land is given to those villagers to cultivate in certain type of contract or in some cases it is found there is no such agreement of give and take. Those who are still in villages have no other options to change their occupation but they are still doing their traditional profession. So here their migration and changing occupational status is directly affecting their economic conditions and they are rapidly changing for some families in their recent history. The village like Shermathang and Melamchhim are rich in using their arable land since they are considered as touristic communities as tourists go Langtang trekking destinations through these settlements whereas Shyamger, Suganche and Chhimi are such villages with comparatively less use of land and they are considered as isolated villages from tourist point of view. The maximum land for a family is found in Shermathang and the minimum is found in Shyamger. But in present days the use of land for agriculture and their holding pattern is reducing since there is scarcity of labours to work in Khet and Bari. And it is due to opportunity of foreign employment that they easily get offer everywhere even in their villages by brokers and agents of Agencies Some poor/food deficit households of Chhimi,and Shermathang villages used to migrate to Sikkim and Laddakh of India seasonally in search of employment. They used to go to Sikkim from Bhadra (August‚ÄìSeptember) to Mangsir (November‚ÄìDecember). This period was slack agricultural season in the provenance and they could find no or little opportunity for the absorption of their labor. And this period/season in Sikkim was an opportunity for the poorer people to work as the agricultural labourers for harvesting cardamom, and this labor requirement used to be, to some extent, fulfilled by the Nepali seasonal migrants. In so doing, they could also earn some income. By and large, such seasonal migration to Sikkim and Laddakh has been a coping mechanism for the poor/food deficit households of study area. Tourists could also camp in the playground of the school. Like in Shermathang, the local farmers used to get benefit from the tourists by selling their commodities such as vegetables and chicken (which the trekking agencies used to buy depending upon their needs).

It is considered to be a separate species, Oenanthe seebohmi, by some authorities. ==Taxonomy== Seebohm's wheatear is normally regarded as the North African subspecies of the widespread Northern wheatear of Eurasia, Greenland and northern North America, however, it is regarded as a full species by some authorities. ==Description== Adult male Seebohm's wheatear in breeding are very distinctive when compared to Northern wheatear, having a black throat, face, lores and ear coverts, sometimes extending to the uppermost part of the breast, occasionally with some buff mixed in. Upperparts are similar to adult male Northern wheatear but sometimes has more white on the forehead and less extensive area of black on the tip of the tail where the white colour may extend along the outer tail. The axillaries and underwing coverts are black and the underparts are often whiter than in Northern wheatear. After the post- breeding moult the upperparts are pale brown with the wing coverts, primaries, secondaries and tertials finely tipped with buff while the greater coverts show whitish tips. The fresh black throat is spotted with paler tips to the feathers and the breast has a buffish tinge. The females are variable from closely resembling the females of the nominate subspecies or showing brown ear coverts and having black or blackish-brown colour over the chin and lores tipped with buff, grey or sandy colour. The upperparts are greyer, often similar to the adult male, although may show a more buffy shade. ==Voice== Seebohm's wheatear's song is slightly slower and lower pitched than that of the Northern wheatear, with its melodious rising and falling phrases being more distinct than in Northern. Calls otherwise similar to the nominate subspecies. ==Distribution and population== Seebohm's wheatear has a disjunct breeding range in north western Africa in north-eastern Morocco where it breeds in the Rif, the Middle Atlas, the High Atlas and central Anti Atlas mountains with another population in north-eastern Algeria in the Aur√®s Mountains and in the Djurdjura Range. It winters in the western Sahel, mainly in south-western Mauritania, northern Senegal and western Mali with smaller numbers in central Mali and some seen at times in winter in southern Morocco. The bulk of the population winters between 15‚Äì18¬∞N and 09‚Äì16¬∞W. It is estimated that 50,000 Seebohm's wheatears winter in west Africa where they overlap with Northern wheatears. ==Habitat== Seebohm's wheatear breeds in mountains on stony plataeux and sparsely vegetated slopes with scattered boulders between 1,700 and 2,300m, although may breed as low as 150m in Algeria. It nests in holes in the ground or between boulders. It winters in open areas of semi-arid savanna although it favours the more humid Guinea savanna with scattered trees such as acacia, Balanites and Salvadora over more arid regions nearer the edge of the desert. ==ReferencesExternal links== Recordings at Xeno-Canto http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Oenanthe- oenanthe?query=ssp:%22seebohmi%22 Seebohm's wheatear Category:Birds of North Africa Seebohm's wheatear ","title":"Seebohm's wheatear"},{"id":"54259381","text":"Mundakkal Beach (Malayalam : ‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Ø‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥≤‡µç‚Äç ‡¥¨‡µÄ‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡µç), is one of the popular beaches in the city of Kollam and a famous tourism spot in Kerala.

In his final two years with the university he played for the men's ice hockey team as a defenseman. After graduating Martin joined the Army and served in the Fourth Infantry Regiment during World War II. After his time with the military was up he returned to his alma mater and coached the freshman ice hockey club in 1944. In 1951 he was named as head coach of the varsity team and set about trying to improve the team's fortunes. The biggest problem the team faced was playing without an artificial ice surface. In his first three plus years with the program it was a regular occurrence to cancel games when the weather turned and melted their playing surface. After having to cancel their final four scheduled games in 1954 plans were put in motion to solve the issue, and in February 1955 the first artificial ice rink, the Harry C. Batchelder Rink, was opened on campus. The rink was a boon for the Wildcats, who saw their winning percentage rise over the next three seasons, culminating in their first double-digit win campaign in 1957‚Äì58. Over his final five seasons with the Wildcats Martin lead his team to four 10+ win records and stepped down in 1962. While coaching the Wildcats Martin earned a master's degree in education and began using it in 1962 when he became an assistant principal at Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School, a job he held until retiring in 1987. Martin was also a reservist in the US Army, retiring with the rank of colonel in 1984. He was inducted into the UNH 100 club Hall of Fame in 1993. ==Personal life== Pepper Martin died in November 2000 at the age of 81.

John Bradby Blake (4 November 1745 ‚Äì 16 November 1773) was an English botanist. Working in China as a resident supercargo for the British East India Company, he sent seeds of local plants to Britain and the American colonies for propagation while also recording and studying Chinese plants and culture. Though he died at the age of 27, Bradby Blake left behind a rich archive of his work and correspondence that gives insight into cross-cultural interactions and botanical study in China at the time. == Family == John Bradby Blake was the son of Captain John Blake (b. 1713) and his wife Mary. John Blake, like his father (John Bradby Blake's grandfather), was a ship's captain. At the age of 20, he sailed for southeast Asia with the East India Company ship the Halifax, serving as second mate. John Blake sailed with the Halifax again on the ship's next voyage; this voyage was his first as a captain. Through voyages with the East India Company and through command of private vessels in Asia, Captain Blake became a wealthy man. From the 1760s he was also manager of a business transporting fresh fish to a market in Westminster, an attempt to circumvent the monopoly of the fishmonger's company, although ultimately stepped away from that project due to financial difficulties. He married Mary Tymewell (b. 1723) on 17 November 1743. Of the couple's 12 children, only three (John Bradby Blake and two sisters) would survive beyond the age of two. While John Bradby Blake was working in Canton (Guangzhou) and Macao, Captain Blake was an essential part of his son's international botanical network. Involved in the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, Captain Blake connected John Bradby Blake's shipments of seeds and other botanical materials with botanists and merchants around the world. This included correspondence with John Ellis, whose designs for transporting live plants across the ocean are very similar to John Bradby Blake's, and Henry Laurens, a future signer of the American Declaration of Independence. It was also Captain John Blake who, with the help of Whang-y-Tong (also called Whang at Tong, Whang Atong, and Whang Yadong), compiled an archive of Bradby Blake's work and correspondence after his death. As well as their botanical interests, the Blakes were also involved to a degree in predatory lending practices based around the tea trade, something that led ultimately to a minor financial crisis and Britain's first embassy to China. ==Life== John Bradby Blake was born in Westminster, London. John Bradby Blake was educated at Westminster School. His academic studies at that time would have consisted primarily of Latin, Greek, and biblical study. He likely learned botany from his father and may have also been influenced by the numerous plant nurseries that were located in the part of London where Bradby Blake grew up; wherever Bradby Blake learned botany, it was probably not at Westminster School. On 29 August 1764, Bradby Blake applied for the position of either writer or junior supercargo with the British East India Company, following in his father's footsteps. Though the Company did not accept his first application, Bradby Blake applied again on 27 August 1766. This time he was successful, and later that year Bradby Blake travelled to Canton (present- day Guangzhou) in China as a supercargo of the East India Company. Following a brief return to London in 1768, Bradby Blake sailed again for China, this time as a resident supercargo. Staying in Macao in between trading seasons, Bradby Blake would spend the remainder of his short life in Asia. He devoted his spare time in Canton to natural science, particularly botany, as well as some attempts to record and study Chinese language and culture. His plan was to procure the seeds of commercially useful plants found in China and to send to Europe and the Americas these seeds and the plants producing them. His idea was that they might be propagated in Great Britain and Ireland as well as in the British colonies. As discussed further below, Blake's scheme was in many ways successful. Cochinchina rice was grown in Jamaica and South Carolina; the tallow-tree prospered in Jamaica, Carolina, and in other American colonies; and many of the plants he sent to Britain were also raised in several botanical gardens near London. He also sent to England some specimens of fossils and ores. He fell ill and died in Canton on 16 November 1773, aged 28. He was unmarried. A proposal for Blake's membership of the Royal Society, made in February 1774, was withdrawn when news of his death became known. == Work and Legacy == When not working as Resident Supercargo for the East India Company in China, Bradby Blake was devoting his time to botany and horticulture, as well as some study of Chinese language and culture. His goals were several: first, to cultivate and ship commercially viable plants back to Europe and beyond and, second, to \\"form a Compleat Chinensis of Drawings copied from Nature, with a Collection of Specimens, Plants, Seeds, etc., etc., with every necessary description relative to their Uses, Virtues, Culture, Seasons, Parts of Fructification, [and] when in bloom.\\" As well as these larger projects, Bradby Blake engaged in the creation of an English-Chinese dictionary, in which Chinese characters are accompanied by illustrations, English phonetic spellings, and English translations. It is important to note that all of Bradby Blake's artistic endeavors were undertaken with the help of Chinese artists and interlocutors, namely Whang-y-Tong and an artist known as Mauk-Sow-U (also called Mai Xiu), making the existing record of his work the result of an international and cross-cultural collaboration. Mauk-Sow-U was likely hired from one of the factories that made Canton export art, a style of painting that provided European sailors with paintings of Asia to take home as souvenirs. The style of the work in the John Bradby Blake archive, however, is markedly different from the style of export art, indicating the botanical focus towards which Bradby Blake steered the project and the skill of Mauk- Sow-U and any other collaborators.  Botanical Shipments  Connected with his father, Captain John Blake, in London (and, through Captain Blake, other merchants and botanists around the world), Bradby Blake was responsible for the introduction of a variety of Chinese plants into North America and the Caribbean. Captain John Blake and John Ellis were essential parts of Bradby Blake's botanical shipping operation. While Bradby Blake himself experimented with the best ways to grow, package, and transport seeds and specimens of tallow, turmeric, camellia and other southeast Asian plants, his London counterparts ensured that his shipments reached the broader world. The Americas were most often the destination, as the British saw the New World colonies as having the ideal climate to support valuable Asian plants. While trade was flourishing before the mid-1700s, the American Revolutionary War put up considerable barriers to this intercontinental botanical exchange. Although many plants were sent to the colonies in the New World, specimens were distributed to the flourishing nurseries and gardens around London and in other cities as well as the Royal Gardens at Kew and the Chelsea Physic Garden (two well-known centers for botanical knowledge). John Bradby Blake in fact grew up in Westminster, a neighborhood in London well-known for its many nurseries, and these nurseries may have been an early influence that led to his interest in botany. The fact that shipments went to smaller, commercial nurseries as well as the more prestigious botanic gardens signifies the importance of these less well-documented nurseries and also the many avenues of communication and trade within the botanic community. Bradby Blake spent considerable time and energy experimenting with various ways to send seeds and plants overseas. For example, with the tallow tree, Bradby Blake tested growing seeds in various types of soil and with varying amounts of water. He also tested and recorded various treatments to preserve seeds; these included storage in a tortoiseshell box, storage in wax, and drying the seeds before later packaging and shipping them. For live plants, Bradby Blake ultimately utilized a method of transport similar to one designed by John Ellis, in which plants are kept in wired cases that held them stable while also allowing for efficient movement of the specimens.  A \\"Compleat Chinensis\\"  A rosy periwinkle painted as part of the unfinished \\"Compleat Chinensis.\\" Painting includes focus on botanical details such as flower and seed anatomy. Created by Bradby Blake with Mauk-Sow-U between 1770 and 1774. While experimenting with methods of packaging and transport, Bradby Blake hired Mauk-Sow-U to create a comprehensive record of Chinese plants, what Bradby Blake also called a \\"Compleat Chinensis.\\" Whang-y-Tong was also involved in this project, as a translator and interlocutor. Because the Chinese government at the time limited European visitors to Canton (Guangzhou) during the trading season and Macao for the rest of the year, Bradby Blake was largely limited in what plants he could acquire. As a result, many of the plants and all of the animals that Bradby Blake and Mauk-Sow-U depicted were species that could be acquired in the markets of those two cities. These materials now act as a record that allows scholars to reconstruct the plants grown in Chinese gardens at the time, particularly those of the Hong merchants, the powerful trade group that dominated the Canton trade era. Today, the existing archive of John Bradby Blake's work consists predominately of this unfinished Chinese flora, created as watercolor and gouache paintings. While there are some depicting fish and one of a turtle, the vast majority of the illustrations are of plants. Bradby Blake and Mauk-Sow-U emphasized various botanical details in the illustrations, including the detailed anatomy of flowers, various stages of development, and even the relationship between figs and fig wasps. While not as elegant as the paintings of the contemporary Georg Dionysius Ehret, of whose work with Linnaeus on taxonomy Bradby Blake was likely aware, the Bradby Blake-commissioned paintings are just as scientifically detailed.  The Dictionary  A third part of Bradby Blake's legacy involves a Chinese/English dictionary, a written and illustrated document that translates various aspects of Chinese culture into English. The dictionary was likely a means for Bradby Blake to learn and study Chinese language and culture and was created with the help of several Chinese writers and illustrators. The dictionary entries are always organized in the same way: first, there is always an accompanying illustration of the item, thing or concept; second, there are neatly drawn Cantonese characters to accompany the illustration; third, there are Cantonese pronunciations written out using English letters; finally, these materials are accompanied by definitions, translations, or explanations in English. The writer of the English text (likely Bradby Blake) often demystifies various components of Chinese culture. For example, on the entry for \\"Dragon,\\" he adds the qualifier \\"imaginary.\\" Similarly, for later entries of players depicting various figures in Chinese mythology and folklore, the English translation does not translate the mythological significance of these figures, instead describing them as people in costumes. For other entries, the English translator adds contextual information to the Chinese entry (for example, for the entry on \\"pillory,\\" the English writer adds that people were often punished \\"for 1, 2, or 3 months\\" and with \\"various weights\\"). The dictionary provides a unique glimpse into cross-cultural interactions at the time, in some ways even more than the botanical illustrations. The different hands working on the dictionary, and the value judgements made by the English writer, reveal multiple voices exchanging and evaluating cultural information.  Posthumous Legacy  Following Bradby Blake's death in 1773, Whang-y-Tong likely brought the drawings and records that today make up the John Bradby Blake archive to England. Whang-y-Tong arrived in London in 1775 at the latest, and possibly as early as August of 1774. As well as passing on the drawings and records to Captain John Blake, Whang-y-Tong met with Joseph Banks, Josiah Wedgwood, and other members of the English elite, and even had his portrait painted by Joshua Reynolds. While the original drawings remained in the hands of the Blake family, being passed down from generation to generation until their 1963 purchase by Paul Mellon, Bradby Blake had already been sending copies of the drawings to Daniel Solander for advice. These copies ended up in the possession of Joseph Banks. Banks subsequently commissioned a manual for British plant collectors working in China, based on the illustrations in Bradby Blake's drawings. As a result the Bradby Blake drawings became the basis for a chain of influence in botanical art: the manual Banks commissioned was used by the botanist William Kerr, who would influence yet another botanical artist, John Reeves, who became known for his Chinese botanical art. The drawings Bradby Blake commissioned and created with Mauk-Sow-U and Whang-y-Tong were the beginning of a long record of Western interest in Chinese plants. ==References== Attribution * ==External links== * Block mould for a portrait medallion depicting John Bradby Blake ‚Äì 1779 The Wedgwood Museum Category:1745 births Category:1773 deaths Category:People from Westminster Category:English botanists Category:18th- century naturalists ","title":"John Bradby Blake"},{"id":"54259488","text":"The 2017 African Fencing Championships were held in Cairo, Egypt from 8 to 12 June. ==Medal summary== Men's events { - Foil    - √âp√©e    - Sabre    - Team Foil    - Team √âp√©e    - Team Sabre    } Women's events { - Foil    - √âp√©e    - Sabre    - Team Foil    - Team √âp√©e    - Team Sabre    } ==Medal table== Host ==References== 2017 African Fencing Championships Category:International fencing competitions hosted by Egypt Category:2017 in Egyptian sport ","title":"2017 African Fencing Championships"},{"id":"54259498","text":"The Capricorn Way is an Australian road route from Rockhampton to Barcaldine in Queensland.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Warrington South,Parliament UK and was first elected at the 2017 general election before losing the seat at the 2019 general election. ==Early life== Rashid was educated at the National College of Business Administration and Economics in Lahore. He has worked as a manager at HBOS and NatWest Bank. He was the Mayor of Warrington in 2016. ==Parliamentary career== In May 2018, Rashid apologised over a tweet which critics suggested was encouraging voters to vote more than once. Rashid said the well-known and jocular phrase \\"vote early, vote often, vote Labour\\", was sent by a member of staff. In October 2018, it was reported that Rashid had been on five overseas trips, worth almost ¬£10,000 in total, since his election. The trips were to Azad Kashmir, China, Germany, Qatar and the West Bank and Israel and the cost met by NGOs, companies or overseas governments. Rashid responded that \\"These trips are largely educational in purpose. The opportunity to meet with individuals on the ground provides invaluable opportunities for learning and understanding. On occasions, the trips have also focused on enabling MPs to support British businesses abroad and on advancing bilateral relations.

According to producer Bakur Bakuradze, the authors of the script relied on the diaries of Viktor Savinykh, that talk in detail about the entire expedition, but \\"it‚Äôs difficult for a person who does not know the subtleties of the space theme to understand all the details. Therefore, some things had to be simplified, and some, on the contrary, strengthened, adapted for our understanding.\\" For these reasons, the names of the main protagonists have been changed. The authors of the film chose material that allowed them to remain true to the facts. The consultants were cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Aleksandr Lazutkin, the head of the Roscosmos by Igor Komarov and specialists from the SP Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (corporation). A specially constructed shooting pavilion was located in a suburb of Saint Petersburg, as the Lenfilm premises were not able to accommodate everything needed. A copy of the TsUP and the Cosmonaut Training Center was created with life-size models of Salyut-7 and Soyuz T-13. Enterprises of the state corporation ¬´Roscosmos¬ª - OAO Rocket and Space Corporation ¬´Energia¬ª and FGBU ¬´Research institute Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center¬ª - provided for filming equipment previously visited in space. Sergey Astakhov, who is known not only as a cameraman, but also as a master in terms of difficult shooting techniques, was invited to design and control complex shooting devices. On the project, he was an operator of space scenes and an engineer of the entire technological part of the shooting. For each frame, their own shooting systems were developed, different suspensions and mounting methods were used to realistically show interaction with objects in zero gravity and to ensure a smooth transition to computer animation. The filmmakers and prototypes of the main characters during a meeting with Vladimir Putin. October 4, 2017. To withstand loads almost like real astronauts, the actors underwent serious physical training. Filming lasted several months with great physical exertion. The working day was 12 hours, and 90% of the shooting period was occupied by ‚Äúhanging‚Äù in the so-called zero gravity. On the set, the actors moved using special cables. To understand how to move in a state of weightlessness, how the body behaves, it was necessary to feel weightlessness. In a special training, the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft ten times rose to a height of several thousand meters and abruptly went down the parabola, while weightlessness appeared for 26 seconds. == Soundtrack == The film contains several extracts of Russian songs : * –¢—Ä–∞–≤–∞ —É –¥–æ–º–∞ (Grass by the house) by Zemlyane. * –ê—Ä–ª–µ–∫–∏–Ω–æ (Harlequin) by Alla Pugacheva. * Song of the Water Carrier by Pavel Olenev (song of the musical comedy Volga-Volga) * –ö–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª–∏ (Ships) by Vladimir Vysotsky. * –ó–æ–ª—É—à–∫–∞ (Cinderella) by Alexey Arkhipovsky. * –ù–∞–º –±—ã –≤—ã–ø–∏—Ç—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–º‚Ä¶ (We should have a drink before the start...) by Yuri Vizbor. == Release == On July 27, 2017, a 30-minute fragment of the film was presented to residents of the city of Baikonur, employees of Roscosmos and enterprises of the rocket and Space industry of Russia. The premiere of the full (two-hour) version of the film took place on August 18, 2017 at the opening of the V Russian short film festival ‚ÄúIn short‚Äù in the city of Kaliningrad. On October 4, 2017, a pre-premiere screening of the film was held in the cinema hall of the State Kremlin Palace, which became the main event of the gala evening dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the launch of the USSR's first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1. After watching the film, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the crew, having watched the film the night before. The meeting was also attended by cosmonauts Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Viktor Savinykh and Oleg Skripochka, the head of the Roscosmos by Igor Komarov and the daughter of the first cosmonaut Elena Gagarina. The all-Russian premiere of the film took place on October 12, 2017 by Nashe Kino. ==Reception== Critical response Salyut 7 has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.83/10.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/salyut_7 ==Technical and historic accuracy== A central part of the film's plot is the idea that NASA was conducting a mission to recover the disabled Salyut 7 to steal Soviet secrets with Space Shuttle Challenger, returning the station to Earth inside the shuttle's cargo bay. The film ends with a fictitious scene showing Challenger rendezvousing with the Salyut 7 station, and the astronauts onboard saluting the cosmonauts on Salyut 7 who were on an emergency EVA to fix the station's solar sensor. This plot possibly originates in a similar theory set forth by The Battle for Salyut: A Space Detective a Russian documentary which was created by a media branch of Roskosmos. Jean-Loup Chr√©tien who flew on both Franco-Soviet and then later Franco-American space missions, serves as the inspiration for the French astronaut sent on the American mission to recover Salyut 7 in the film. Jean-Loup was indeed on the backup crew of the STS-51-G flight of Space Shuttle Discovery that was launched 11 days after the start of Soyuz T-13 on June 17, 1985. However Jean-Loup did not fly on STS-51-G, instead with fellow French astronaut Patrick Baudry onboard. The only launch of Challenger concurrent Soyuz T-13 was STS-51-F launched on July 29, 1985; well after the Soyuz T-13 crew had completed their primary emergency repairs. STS-51-I also flew concurrent to the Soyuz T-13 mission. While STS-51-F had the largest launch inclination of these three shuttle missions at 49.5 degrees, the Challenger would have been unlikely to be able to rendezvous with Salyut 7 which was at a 51.6 degree inclination. == See also == * List of films featuring space stations * Apollo 13, a 1995 docudrama film about the 1970 Apollo 13 disaster * The Age of Pioneers, a 2017 docudrama film about Alexei Leonov's historic 1965 first spacewalk == References  External links == * * Category:2017 films Category:Russian-language films Category:2010s disaster films Category:2010s action drama films Category:2010s historical drama films Category:2010s adventure drama films Category:Russian films Category:Films about astronauts Category:Disaster films based on actual events Category:Russian disaster films Category:Russian action drama films Category:Russian historical drama films Category:Russian adventure drama films Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films set in the Soviet Union Category:Pregnancy films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Lenfilm films Category:2017 3D films Category:Russian 3D films Category:2017 drama films ","title":"Salyut 7 (film)"},{"id":"54259700","text":"Amyntor (Ancient Greek: ·ºàŒºœçŒΩœÑœâœÅ Am√Ωntor \\"defender\\") was the name of a 4th- century BC Macedonian aristocrat, possibly of Athenian descent.

It has a rosette of bright green leaves at the base of the plant and a single green and white, sickle-shaped flower. It is widespread and often common in Victoria but also occurs further north and west, and in Tasmania ==Description== Pterostylis falcata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of three to six bright green leaves surrounding the base of the flowering stem. Each leaf is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide. A single dark green and white flower long and wide is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is much longer than the petals and gradually tapers to a point. There is a wide gap between the galea and the lateral sepals. The lateral sepals are erect and have narrow tips long and a deep V-shaped sinus between them. The labellum is long, wide, brown and curved and half of it protrudes through the sinus. Flowering occurs from September to February. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis falcata was first formally described in 1915 by Richard Sanders Rogers and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria. The specific epithet (falcata) is a Latin word meaning \\"curved like a sickle\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The sickle greenhood occurs in the south-eastern states of Australia where it grows in wet places such as near creeks and the rosette is sometimes covered by flowing water. It is most common and widespread in Victoria but is also found in eastern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania but is classed as \\"endangered\\" in the last two of these states. ==References== falcata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1915 ","title":"Pterostylis falcata"},{"id":"54259863","text":"Karen Elizabeth Lee (born 15 January 1959) is a British Labour Party politician.

This was intended to establish a new status quo for both franchises after the events in the 2016 \\"Inhumans vs X-Men\\" storyline, which concluded a number of then-ongoing storylines that followed the 2015 \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline. One notable effect of the relaunch is that it reaffirmed the importance of the X-Men characters and franchise, which some critics felt had grown isolated and diminished in prestige in light of the success of the Avengers-centered films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a status that some felt was attributed to 20th Century Fox's then-ownership of the feature film rights for the X-Men, before Disney bought the studio in March 2019. ==Publication history== \\"ResurrXion\\" was initially announced in September 2016 before the storylines \\"Death of X\\" and \\"Inhumans vs X-Men\\" began and it was stated that it would take place canonically after the \\"Inhumans vs X-Men\\" comes to a close. From that time on until March when \\"ResurrXion\\" was launched many teasers for each related series were released in the following months. In order to make room for the \\"ResurrXion\\" lineup of comics, some of the then-current Inhumans and X-Men titles were cancelled, including Extraordinary X-Men, All-New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Uncanny Inhumans, and Mosaic. In March a few weeks before the \\"ResurrXion\\" lineup was launched some of the writers at Marvel teased what to expect from some of the characters involved in the upcoming event. The event was officially launched on March 29, 2017 with Inhumans Prime and X-Men Prime. ==Prime synopses== In order to set up for the main new ongoing titles that were coming up, Marvel launched two one-shot books, X-Men Prime and Inhumans Prime. Each book was used to set up how each team was going to move forward after the events of \\"Inhumans vs X-Men\\", as well as setting up the story arcs for other tie-in books. Inhumans Prime synopsis The Inhuman Royal Family tracks Maximus the Mad to the Grand Canyon to bring him and his followers home. Maximus tries to use his powers to instigate a fight amongst Medusa's followers, but Swain uses her powers to cancel out his, leading to his capture in New Attilan. While imprisoned he taunts Black Bolt with a mysterious dark secret of their past. Meanwhile, due to the events of their war against the X-Men culminating with Medusa deciding to destroy the remaining Terrigen in favor of the X-Men, she addresses the people of New Attilan and abdicates the throne; Iso becomes the new ruler of New Attilan in Medusa's stead. Medusa's final command as queen is to sentence Maximus to eternal solitude in space. Iso makes her first official speech as ruler and announces that even though the Terrigen is gone and thus the source of their powers, they will continue to thrive as a people working closely alongside the rest of the world. As the now-former Royal Family begins to plan their next move given their new status quo of living without their birthright of Terrigen, Marvel Boy appears with a mysterious proposition for them.Inhumans Prime. Marvel Comics. X-Men Prime synopsis Kitty Pryde returns to earth and tries to establish a normal life for herself outside of superheroics until Storm finds her and informs her of everything that has transpired on earth between while Kitty was in space. Storm then announces to Kitty that she's contemplating resigning as leader of the X-Men due to leading them to war against the Inhumans when the situation could have been handled diplomatically instead. Storm takes Kitty to X-Haven so she can see first-hand how drastically things have changed for the X-Men in Kitty's absence. Meanwhile, Lady Deathstrike is trying to lay low and is travelling with a group of refugees until their mode of transportation is attacked. Deathstrike survives but ends up blocked by a mysterious woman who seems to be oddly interested in her. Deathstrike stabs her with her claws but shortly after that a missile barrage ambushes her, rendering her unconscious. The woman survived the stabbing and reports back to her employers that she has successfully captured Lady Deathstrike. While touring X-Haven Kitty realizes that the time-displaced X-Men have all left and are looking for their own place in the world after learning that they aren't from the Earth 616 timeline. Kitty holds a meeting with all of the X-Men and agrees to lead them as long as Storm remains on the team. She then has Magik teleport X-Haven from Limbo to Central Park. Meanwhile, the mysterious organization that kidnapped Lady Deathstrike expresses a mysterious interest to also capture Logan, Sabertooth, Warpath, and Domino X-Men Prime. Marvel Comics. ==Notable changes== Many important changes took place in both Inhumans and X-Men titles that have had a significant impact on the direction and tone of each series for the long-run. Impact on Inhumans titles The now-former Royal Family joins Marvel Boy on a potential suicide-mission to space in order to learn about an ancient Kree secret regarding the Inhumans that Marvel Boy claims to know about. Medusa's hair begins to fall out, signalling that she is dying due to the Terrigen within her system reacting negatively against her own biological systems.

The structure was probably built about 1760 by Nathaniel Hayden. Local historians have speculated that it served as a residence of the Hayden family prior to the construction of the larger house next door, but it is more likely that this was built as a shoemaking shop that the family is known to have run.

Compared to Monopoly and snakes and ladders by contemporary commentators, the game has players take on the roles of mandarins; the objective of the game is to attain the highest possible bureaucratic position, whilst accumulating more prestige and monetary funds than other players. Historically a gambling game doubling as an educational tool for acquainting Chinese males with the bureaucratic hierarchy, it still enjoys relative popularity nowadays. ==History== A Water Margin edition of Shengguan Tu. Early history The keju imperial examination system, which Shengguan Tu is based on, was first explicitly mandated upon Chinese students during the Sui dynasty. According to the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Shengguan Tu was first introduced during the Tang dynasty which immediately succeeded the Sui dynasty. In his Preface to Selecting a Bureau by Throwing Dice (838), Tang scholar Fang Qianli writes of his playing Caixuan Ge (Selecting a Bureau), \\"an ancestor to Shengguan Tu\\", while stranded on a boat with a few friends in 836. Beyond that, however, the \\"few\\" historical sources \\"dealing with (the game) are confused and tend to feed off each other\\". Twelfth-century writer Xu Du references the game in a short passage in Quesao Bian; subsequent historical sources, including the eighteenth-century Gaiyu Congkao by Zhao Yi, rely heavily on the information provided by Xu. However, Xu's account was based on others' verbal accounts, and the quotations of his passage are believed to have been corrupted, according to Carole Morgan in the Journal of the American Oriental Society. A more recent attempt by Cai Ce in 1968 to retrace the early history of Shengguan Tu is similarly \\"so flawed as to be practically useless\\". Tang government official Li He was the undisputed inventor of Caixuan Ge, the early incarnation of Shengguan Tu that Fang Qianli played; Li's game was improved upon and modified by subsequent officials, including Liu Gongfu, who is credited with creating the \\"version that has been transmitted to the world\\". Overseas export The Western world became aware of Shengguan Tu in as early as the seventeenth century, when Robert Hyde published the Latin book on \\"oriental games\\" titled De Ludis Orientalibilis, a portion of which is dedicated to describing the game. In the nineteenth century, Chinese emigrants to the United States, particularly California and New York, who worked as clerks and \\"barely literate\\" blue-collar workers enjoyed playing Shengguan Tu as a pastime. The game boards they would use were typically printed in Guangzhou. Other versions Shengguan Tu inspired the creation of similar games. The Song dynasty poet Wang Gui wrote a poem on a gambling game called Xuanxian Tu, or Selecting an Immortal, whose gameplay is identical to that of Shengguan Tu save players are either immortals or commoners, instead of mandarins. In Baiguan Duo (Instructions for all Officials), invented during the Ming dynasty, dice are substituted with \\"bright stones\\". Zhonning Shengguan Tu (Promoting Loyal and [Not] Sycophantic Officials) focused on a bureaucrat's \\"personal character and competence\\", and access to which was limited to the social circles of two Ming officials. An apocryphal anecdote by Zhao Yi has it that the ailing Emperor Xingzong of Liao began promoting or demoting officials by the role of a die instead of using his own judgement. Twenty-first century Nowadays the game is still frequently played in parts of mainland China, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Likewise, Shengguan Tu game boards are still in production. As of 2006, some Shengguan Tu boards can cost as much as . In December 2008, as part of its winter festivities, the North District Tourist Service Centre () in Changhua, Taiwan installed a lifesize Shengguan Tu board. In January 2016, as part of its first anniversary celebrations, the Taiwanese Fongyi Academy in Fengshan District, Kaohsiung rolled out some hundred modernised copies of Shengguan Tu for public use. ==Gameplay== Shengguan Tu is typically played on a sheet of paper with six dice that are to be rolled in a bowl. Boards come in two sizes: large and small, with the former naturally having more \\"charts\\" to indicate different bureaus than the latter. The number of charts available ranges from 63 to 117. Each player is represented by a main token, alongside two other mandarin tokens. Each player starts off with 120 cash in tokens and as a student in China's imperial examination system who is able to rise up the ranks with the roll of the dice; ranking promotions or demotions arbitrarily correspond with the value rolled, and is dictated by a rules booklet available for reference during gameplay. Additionally, players who incur demotions have to pay fines. However, the game also includes the element of corruption; favours and titles can be bought, and the rules permit players to receive \\"donations\\". Since at least the Qing dynasty, there has been no universal standard of Shengguan Tu rules. Furthermore, the written instructions provided on one version of the board obtained by Carole Morgan often \\"contradict each other\\" and have to be \\"supplemented by orally transmitted rules\\". ==Reception== Scholar Ji Yun (also known as Ji Laoyan), who was active during the Qing dynasty, was allegedly very addicted to Shengguan Tu as a gambling game. Legend has it that his addiction impeded his ability to do his work efficiently, to the point that the Qianlong Emperor summoned him for an explanation. However, Ji Yun was able to convince Qianlong that he had been hard at work studying the bureaucratic system, and Qianlong became more impressed with the scholar. Cai Ce, who authored a pamphlet on the game, derides the utilisation of Shengguan Tu as \\"vulgar entertainment\\" in the form of a gambling game, while praising it as a \\"graphic learning tool which clearly depicts the workings of the Qing bureaucracy\\". In contrast, Tong Hongju points out that even as a gambling game, the stakes are considerably low, and the element of gambling only enhances the joy of playing Shengguan Tu. Carole Morgan, in an essay titled The Chinese Game of Shengguan tu published in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, remarks that the game is \\"unusual\\" in that it \\"not only reproduces the a complex administrative framework but also includes the malpractices inherent in the system\\". Shengguan Tu has been described as an amalgamation of Monopoly and snake and ladders. ==See also== * List of board games ==References== Citations Bibliography * * * Category:Chinese ancient games Category:Economic simulation board games Category:Individual sports Category:Multiplayer games Category:Tabletop games Category:Traditional board games ","title":"Shengguan Tu"},{"id":"54260259","text":"The canton of Millau-2 is an administrative division of the Aveyron department, southern France.

She was acquired by the US Navy for use during the war. ==Construction== St. Francis, a steel-hulled, screw freighter built in 1914, by the North Ireland Ship Building Co., County Londonderry, Ireland, was acquired by the US Navy at Baltimore on 19 June 1918, under United States Shipping Board (USSB) charter from the United States Steel Corporation; and commissioned there on 25 June. ==Service history== Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, the ship was loaded with US Army supplies and sailed for New York, where she joined a convoy and sailed for France, on 4 July. The ships reached Brest, France, on 19 July; and, the next day, St. Francis proceeded to West Hampton, England, where she discharged her cargo. On 15 August, she sailed in convoy for the United States and reached Baltimore, on 27 August. Reloaded with Army supplies, she again got underway on 18 September, and steamed via New York, to France, and arrived at La Pallice, on 13 October. The next day, she proceeded to St. Nazaire, where she unloaded. Back in Baltimore on 14 November, three days after the armistice was signed, the ship was transferred from an Army to a USSB Account and sailed from New York, on 26 January 1919, for Cristobal, Panama. After transiting the canal, she proceeded down the Pacific coast of South America and reached Valparaiso, Chile, on 17 February. After returning through the canal, the ship loaded a commercial cargo of sugar at Cienfuegos, Cuba, and arrived at New York, on 8 April. She was decommissioned there on 28 April 1919, and the same day was transferred to the USSB for simultaneous return to her owner. ==Fate== In 1933, she was sold to the International Freighting Company, Wilmington, Delaware, and renamed Lammot du Pont.

Described as \\"the world's most beautiful women\\" by the Norwegian painter Christian Krohg, she was given a wider repertoire than would normally have been possible for an actress without formal training, thanks in part to her sweet singing voice. She progressed over the years, performing in more serious works, for example as Portia in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Elisabeth in Heiberg's Elverh√∏j. ==Biography== Born on 21 November 1863 in Copenhagen, Emma Alice Lange was the daughter of the translator Carl Vilhelm Lange (1820‚Äì75) and Dorothea Stibolt (1833‚Äì98). In 1888, she married the actor Poul Nielsen (divorced in 1897) and in 1897 Captain Fritz Thomsen (1864‚Äì1935). She d√©buted in 1883 at the Royal Danish Theatre in Jens Christian Hostrup's Eventyr paa Fodrejsen, making such an impression with her attractive looks that she was immediately engaged to play the roles of beautiful young women in other Vaudeville works by Heisberg, including Abekatten, K√∏ge Huskors, Aprilsnarrene and Nej. Her major breakthrough came in December 1900 when she took on a more mature role, playing Maria in Edvard Brandes' Under Loven at Copenhagen's Folketeatret, with a passion no one had expected of her. Among the most interesting of the 170 roles she played were Henriette in Skyldig ‚Äì ikke skyldig, Maria in Paa Storhove, Akulina in M√∏rkets Magt, the romantically desolate Katuscha in Opstandelse and the gipsy artist in Johan Ulfstjerna. Thereafter she felt increasingly threatened by the success of Betty Nansen. Her last role was the Jewish women Gerda Sommer in Henri Nathansen's Daniel Hertz. Emma Thomsen died on 15 January 1910 in Copenhagen and is buried in Assistens Cemetery. ==References== Category:19th-century Danish actresses Category:Danish stage actresses Category:1863 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Actresses from Copenhagen ","title":"Emma Thomsen"},{"id":"54260353","text":" INS Tillanchang is a patrol vessel of the Trinkat class patrol vessel of Indian Navy designed and constructed by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers in Kolkata, West Bengal.

In 1979, he moved with his family to Grimaldi, a frontier village near Ventimiglia on the Italian Riviera. By chance, Colin Colahan, a painter and sculptor, lived in the same area and provided mentorship. Jonas painted a wide range of subjects along the Italian-French-Monegasque coast for exhibition, particularly of street life, caf√© culture and backstage scenes, including a series of orchestra rehearsals, circus, jazz and cabaret, including at the Op√©ra de Monte Carlo.  British cultural and sporting life (1985‚Äì1995)  During this period, his paintings provide \\"social commentary\\" on the complex and sometimes paradoxical relationships between major social and sporting events and the people who attend them, such as at Ascot, the Henley Royal Regatta, cricket and polo matches, on golf courses, bowls and croquet laws, tennis courts, and jousting at Hever Castle. His interest in vintage cars led to a number of paintings featuring classic British cars, such as 'From Rushhour with Love.' His images have been reproduced on over two million greetings cards and he was artist in residence at ING's headquarters in 2001.  Portraits (1996‚Äìpresent)  Johnny Jonas has painted portraits throughout his career, which he considers to be \\"visual biography,\\" His commissions include: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Elizabeth II, David Cameron, Aga Khan IV, Vincent O'Brien, Baron Vincent of Coleshill, Lord Wakeham, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe, Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Henry Cecil, Sir Richard Branson, Albert Roux, Baron Levene of Portsoken, Dick Francis, Brian Sewell, Lester Piggott, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Tony McCoy, Bear Grylls, Satish Kumar, and Alec Stewart, among others.

In 1953 it was bought by Chrysler Corporation without its former Beautyware plumbing division which is now owned by Cer√°micas Industriales, South America (CISA). ==History== Walter Briggs, by trade an upholsterer of carriages, after experience as a plant superintendent outside the industry joined a Detroit carriage builder and repairer, B F Everitt Company. Everitt had made some automobile bodies for Ransom E Olds and Henry Ford. Walter Briggs was soon in charge of the shops then became vice- president and then president. In 1909 the owners decided to make complete cars and Briggs was able to buy the Everitt coachbuilding business and reorganise it as Briggs Manufacturing Company. 1923 (model) Essex coach $1245, touring $1045, cabriolet $1145 At this time the new Briggs business provided upholstery for a number of Detroit manufacturers, In 1910 Briggs agreed to supply 10,000 Ford Model T interiors and a close association was formed. In 1922 Briggs made for Essex a closed touring car at a price near an open touring car and by 1925 Essex offered buyers the option of an open or closed Briggs bodied car at the same price. As demand for the closed cars expanded more businesses were acquired including competitors supplying to Ford. During the 1920s Ford and General Motors began to make their own bodies and Briggs became the largest independent. Other prominent independent builders of automobile bodies included: Murray Body Corporation, C R Wilson Body Company, Edward G Budd Manufacturing Company and Fisher Body Company. LeBaron 1938 Lincoln V12 by LeBaron and Briggs LeBaron Carossiers Inc, a New York City custom body builder, was bought in 1926 and activities moved to Detroit and named LeBaron Studios. A New York design office remained at 724 Fifth Avenue. The studio's first influence was on design of the Briggs-built open bodies for the Ford Model A. By that time Briggs' Detroit plants were at Harper Avenue, Mack Avenue, Meldrum Avenue and Vernor Highway. A fire at Harper Avenue caused Briggs to lease the Model T plant at Highland Park in which they made many bodies for Chrysler. Later Briggs leased space in Ford's Cleveland, Ohio plant. LeBaron designers were responsible for the 1933 Ford V8 body and the Lincoln Zephyr. LeBaron featured as a Chrysler model name on some of Chrysler's Imperials until near the end of the 20th century. Ford Ford V8 Pilot with body by Briggs Dagenham Ford obtained and retained access to Briggs' records and controlled pricing of products supplied to Ford and also supply of raw materials to Briggs. Briggs followed Ford to the United Kingdom setting up a plant for their Briggs Motor Bodies Limited in Dagenham when British Ford built there. Ownership was moved to an English subsidiary in 1935 retaining a 60 per cent shareholding. Another plant was set up in Doncaster, England after World War II to build bodies for other brands. Briggs Detroit plants (supplying Ford) were the centers of strike action by United Auto Workers in 1933 and 1937 where UAW was successful. Other well-known brands that fitted Briggs' bodies were: Lincoln, Chrysler, Packard, Hudson, Pierce Arrow and Marmon ==Inhouse== The Great Depression caused many customers to bring many more operations under their direct control. Briggs had provided two-thirds of Ford's bought-in bodies in 1936 but the share had fallen to just over a quarter by 1939 and those went to Lincoln and Mercury. Ford, Chrysler, Packard and Hudson set up their own in-house design departments and LeBaron lost importance for Briggs. 1941 Packard Clipper Beginning with the all-new 1941 Clipper all Packard bodies were built by Briggs. World War II A workforce of over 36,000 built aircraft gun-turrets, doors, wing components, bomb doors, heavy and medium tank hulls, trucks and ambulance bodies. ==Sale to Chrysler== Walter Briggs died in January 1952 and in December 1953 Chrysler Corporation bought Briggs' entire US body building operation. There were twelve plants, ten in Detroit, and another two in Youngstown, Ohio and Evansville Indiana. The Packard body plant was leased to Packard. Dagenham and Trafford Park were sold to Ford Motor Company Limited and customer Jowett ended production and went out of business. ==Beautyware== A new product appeared in 1933. Briggs engineers had worked out how to replace the standard heavy cast iron bathtub. They used their expertise in deep draw metal stamping and the machinery for making car fenders. The new bathtub was stackable and about one-quarter of the weight of the cast iron product. The Briggs family kept Beautyware and did not sell it to Chrysler in 1953. Bought by Cer√°micas Industriales, South America (CISA) in 1997 it is now directed from Charleston South Carolina. Briggs Plumbing Products operates plants throughout the Americas. ==Europe== Briggs Bodies Limited set up works at Dagenham to manufacture steel bodies for cars and trucks and steel-stampings for Ford Motor Company Limited. Work started in May 1930 and production began in 1932. By July 1935 it had 4,500 employees and included these customers beside Ford, Austin, Chrysler, Riley, Standard and others.

Behind the mitred figure are a number of standing men wearing armor and carrying weapons. \\"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" (also expressed as \\"troublesome priest\\" or \\"meddlesome priest\\") is a quote attributed to Henry II of England preceding the death of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1170. While the quote was not expressed as an order, it prompted four knights to travel from Normandy to Canterbury, where they killed Becket. The phrase is commonly used in modern-day contexts to express that a ruler's wish may be interpreted as a command by his or her subordinates. ==Origin== According to historical records, Henry made the infamous outburst on Christmas 1170 at his castle at Bures, Normandy, at the height of the Becket controversy. He had just been informed that Becket had excommunicated a number of bishops supportive of the king, including the Archbishop of York. Edward Grim, who was present at Becket's murder and subsequently wrote the Life of St. Thomas, quotes Henry as saying: In George Lyttleton's 1772 History of the Life of King Henry the Second, the quote is rendered as \\"[he said] that he was very unfortunate to have maintained so many cowardly and ungrateful men in his court, none of whom would revenge him of the injuries he sustained from one turbulent priest.\\" In The Chronicle of the Kings of England (1821), it becomes \\"Will none of these lazy insignificant persons, whom I maintain, deliver me from this turbulent priest?\\", which is then shortened to \\"who shall deliver me from this turbulent priest?\\". The longer quote is in the footnote. No such phrase is spoken in T. S. Eliot's 1932 play Murder in the Cathedral, as Henry does not appear in that play. In Jean Anouilh's 1959 play Becket, Henry says, \\"Will no one rid me of him? A priest! A priest who jeers at me and does me injury.\\" In the 1964 film Becket, which was based on the Anouilh play, Henry says, \\"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\\" ==Consequences== Purportedly upon hearing the king's words, four knights‚ÄîReginald FitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy and Richard le Breton‚Äîtravelled from Normandy to Canterbury with the intention of forcing Becket to withdraw his excommunication, or, alternatively, taking him back to Normandy by force. The day after their arrival, they confronted Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. When Becket resisted their attempts to seize him, they slashed at him with their swords, killing him. Becket, Thomas (1120?‚Äì1170), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Although nobody, even at the time, believed that Henry directly ordered that Becket be killed, his words had started a chain of events that was likely to have such a result. Moreover, as Henry's harangue had been directed not at Becket, but at his own household, the four probably thought that a failure to act would be regarded as treachery, potentially punishable by death. Following the murder, Becket was venerated and Henry was vilified. There were demands that the king be excommunicated. Pope Alexander forbade Henry to hear mass until he had expiated his sin. In May 1172, Henry did public penance in Avranches Cathedral. ==Use and analysis== The Turbulent Priest was the title of Piers Compton's 1957 biography of Becket. According to Alfred H. Knight, the phrase \\"had profound long-term consequences for the development of constitutional law\\" because its consequences forced the king to accept the benefit of clergy, the principle that secular courts had no jurisdiction over clergy.

It bears a similar name to a later, more famous, political philosophy work by Locke, namely Two Treatises of Government. The two works, however, have very different positions. ==Structure== The work comprises two articles. The first article is in English, entitled Question: whether the Civil Magistrate may lawfully impose and determine the use of indifferent things in Religious Worship, to which Locke replies affirmatively. The article is largely an attempt to refute Edward Bagshaw‚Äôs The Great Question Concerning Things Indifferent in Religious Worship, published a year earlier and advocating religious toleration. The second article, in Latin, is entitled . In this article Locke elaborates on the concepts of law and authority upon which the first article is based.Thomas, D.O. (1968). John Locke: Two tracts on government. Philosophical Books, 9(2), 1-3. ==Historical background== Between 1642 and 1651 England suffered several armed conflicts known as the English Civil War. These conflicts arose around religious tensions and questions of the King's right to rule. Locke, growing up in such an atmosphere and influenced by earlier writers such as Thomas Hobbes, feared liberty could lead to civil disturbance.Encyclopedia Britannica, John Locke. Tension between authoritarian and liberal views can be found already in this work. A few years later, Locke co-authored the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which promise religious toleration, but establish aristocracy, slavery and serfdom.Armitage, David Armitage, D. (2004).

Only later in his life did Locke come to endorse the liberalism he is known for, though he was continually involved with slave trade throughout his life.Slavery and London, Se√°n Mac Math√∫naHarris, T., & Taylor, S.

The chain operates its anchor stores that include Walter Mart Supermarket, Walter Mart Cinemas, Abenson Appliances, Homeplus Furniture, Electroworld and SB Furnitures. Filipino retail stores such as Watsons, Ace Hardware, Robinsons Department Store and W Department Store are also occupying most of Walter Mart's branches. Walter Mart's corporate headquarters are located in North EDSA, Quezon City. ==History== Walter Mart was founded in the 1990s by Wilson Lim, at the time of the economic crisis when the major players were not expanding aggressively. The company saw that there was an opportunity to expand in developing communities and uplift their standards of living by providing gainful employment to the locals and improving their shopping experience. In January 2013 SM Retails and SM Prime Holdings entered into a joint venture agreement with Walter Mart to co-manage the operations of WM-branded community-based malls located in the provinces of Central Luzon, Southern Tagalog and cities in Metro Manila. In February 2016, the SM-Waltermart group rescinded an earlier deal to jointly develop shopping malls with 8990 Holdings as these may take business away from SM's own shopping centers. ==Walter Mart Supermarket== Walter Mart Supermarket is located within most Walter Mart malls. The first supermarket started in E. Rodriguez, Quezon City In 1995, the owners entered into a partnership with International Grocers Alliance (IGA), making it the only supermarket chain in the Philippines to become a member of the organization. Currently, it is now one of the youngest and fastest-growing supermarket chains in the Philippines with 28 more locations in Metro Manila, Central and South Luzon. == W Mall == W Mall is a community mall of Walter Mart that was open last April 26, 2018 at Macapagal Boulevard corner Coral Way, Pasay City.

The Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) followed the 2017 United Kingdom general election which resulted in a hung parliament. Negotiations between the two parties began on 9 June, the day after the election, and the final agreement was signed and published on 26 June 2017. The agreement, signed by the two parties' chief whips, Gavin Williamson for the Conservatives and Jeffrey Donaldson for the DUP, secured DUP confidence-and-supply support for a Conservative minority government led by Theresa May. ==Conservative‚ÄìDUP dialogue before 2017==  Prior to the 2010 and 2015 general elections  Previously the Conservatives cooperated with the DUP's main unionist rival, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), whose MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster until that arrangement was ended in 1974. Relations between the Conservatives and UUP worsened following the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, although the two parties continued to work together, especially after the 1992 election when John Major's government had to rely on their support. In January 2010, the then Conservative leader David Cameron held talks with both the UUP and DUP about an electoral pact for the 2010 general election. The Conservatives had already formed an electoral alliance with the UUP (see Ulster Conservatives and Unionists) in 2009, but had previously rejected DUP calls for agreed unionist candidates in selected Northern Ireland seats. The prospect of a unionist pact caused disquiet on the part of some members of the Northern Ireland Conservatives, and ultimately a pact with the DUP was rejected. The Ulster Conservatives and Unionists electoral pact ended after the party failed to win any Northern Ireland seats in the 2010 general election. As at June 2017, the UUP currently have no Members of Parliament. In October 2014, it was reported by the Financial Times that informal discussions were taking place between the Conservatives and the DUP ahead of the 2015 general election, which was widely expected to result in a hung parliament. The DUP had also offered conditional support to the Labour Party, if it should emerge as the largest party. The 2015 election resulted in a Conservative majority, and no public agreement with the DUP was struck. It subsequently emerged that the Labour Party had explored securing DUP support during both the 2010 and 2015 general elections. According to The Daily Telegraph, representatives of the Conservative leadership drew up a \\"draft agreement\\" with the DUP following the 2015 general election, in order to help increase the small Conservative majority in the event of a vote of no confidence. Neither party confirmed that they engaged in talks in 2015 as The Telegraph had described.  2015‚Äì17: Conservative majority  A formal \\"draft agreement\\" between the two parties was reached in the days following the 2015 general election, after that election resulted in a Conservative majority. The draft co-operation deal, which was never ratified and not made public at the time, stated that the DUP agreed to support the government in any no-confidence motion, and some other matters, excluding welfare reforms, Northern Ireland related issues and matters relating to devolution of powers throughout the UK. Under Theresa May, the relationship developed further. The Conservatives and DUP entered informal arrangements in 2016, in order to increase the working majority for the Conservative government. The DUP had hosted a reception at the Conservative Party conference on 4 October 2016. James Brokenshire, the Conservative Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, was set to attend a DUP fundraiser on 27 October 2016, but later backed out due to the controversy that arose from this. Since May became Prime Minister, until the 2017 general election, the DUP voted with the Conservatives 77% of the time. ==2017 Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement== Background not assuming seats by taking the oaths required (or statutory declarations in lieu) and otherwise abstaining from the UK Parliament since their establishment (in their original form) in 1905. The 2017 snap election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party having returned the most seats in the House of Commons with 317 Conservative MPs, but without an overall majority needed to govern (326 out of 650 seats). The DUP, which won 10 seats in the election (its best Westminster electoral performance to date), suggested it would be able to provide a coalition or confidence-and- supply arrangement depending on negotiations. Theresa May, incumbent Conservative prime minister, announced her intention on 9 June 2017 to form a new minority government with support from the DUP, whom she described as \\"friends and allies\\". Initially, both parties implied that this support would be in the form of a confidence-and-supply agreement, with the DUP backing a Conservative Queen's Speech and certain other elements of the government's legislative agenda. However, in the afternoon of 10 June, it was reported by Robert Peston that May was in fact seeking to 'enter into a formal coalition agreement as opposed to the less formal \\"confidence-and-supply\\" arrangement', having sent a team of officials headed by Chief Whip Gavin Williamson to negotiate a deal in Belfast. Despite this, later that evening it was announced that the DUP had agreed, so far, only to the principles of a \\"confidence\\" deal with the Conservatives, which would be discussed by the Cabinet on 12 June. Later still, Downing Street issued a statement reporting a Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement had been reached in principle. Yet a few hours later, in the early hours of Sunday 11 June, the statement was retracted when it was claimed according to Sky News that it had been \\"issued in error\\", and that talks between the Conservative Party and DUP were still ongoing. Williamson had outlined a deal that would provide the government with \\"certainty and stability\\", but the DUP rejected any finalisation ‚Äì simply stating talks had been \\"positive\\". On 12 June it was suggested that the Queen's Speech, which had been due to set out the government's legislative agenda on 19 June, could be delayed to give the DUP and Conservatives more time to negotiate. It was reported that the ongoing dialogue could have delayed the start of Brexit negotiations with the EU, which were also due to begin on 19 June. On the afternoon of 13 June, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader who had travelled to London for negotiations with May, stated that discussions had gone well and that there were \\"no outstanding issues\\" left between the two parties. Following the meeting, it was reported by Sky News journalists David Blevins and Connor Sephton that Foster did not return to Belfast as planned, instead choosing to remain in London to continue the talks, and that a DUP source confirmed that a deal would be reached \\"within the next 24 hours.\\" On the same day, the British Parliament reconvened. However, on 14 June DUP sources stated that no announcement of an agreement would be made that day, as it was deemed to be \\"inappropriate\\" to do so while events relating to the Grenfell Tower fire, which had begun in the early hours of the morning, were still developing. The DUP released a statement claiming that the arrangement was already 95 percent agreed upon, thus downplaying speculation that the announcement could be delayed another week. On 15 June, the new Conservative Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, announced that the date of the Queen's Speech had been set for 21 June (two days later than originally planned), and that the speech would go ahead regardless of whether the agreement with the DUP had been finalised; Brexit talks started on the scheduled date of June 19 as well. Amid some concern that the lack of a finalised deal could lead to DUP MPs abstaining in the vote to pass the Queen's Speech, Arlene Foster stated that her MPs would support the Conservative government's first test in the Commons as it was \\"right and proper\\" to do so. By 20 June, the day before the Queen's Speech, talks between the two parties had been ongoing for 10 days. It was reported that senior DUP sources told the BBC that the Conservatives should not \\"take the DUP for granted\\", and that talks had not proceeded in the way the party leadership had anticipated. On 21 June, a senior DUP MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson denied media reports that talks were stalling between the Tories and DUP. He confirmed that while the DUP was asking HM Treasury for an increased budget for Northern Ireland infrastructure spending, it was not the large ¬£2bn investment reported by some media outlets. On the morning of 26 June, Foster returned to Downing Street with Nigel Dodds and stated that she was hopeful that an agreement would be announced later that day. Reactions to the proposed agreement The proposed agreement attracted criticism and forewarning from some politicians and organisations, and has faced a degree of opposition from within the Conservative Party itself. Welsh Labour minister Jo Stevens, the Deputy Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Amelia Womack and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service criticised the DUP's anti-abortion stance and expressed concern about the party's possible influence in the minority government. LGBT+ Conservatives and Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson (as she herself pointed out, a Scottish Protestant planning a marriage to an Irish Catholic woman) criticised DUP stances on social issues, in particular on LGBT rights. Davidson demanded a \\"categoric assurance\\" from Theresa May that \\"there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK\\" and that the government \\"would use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland\\". Davidson later said that she been given an assurance by May that gay rights would not be eroded in return for DUP support. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston also stated her public opposition to any DUP influence on the government's social policy. In response to these concerns, Conservative Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon stated that the agreement would focus on the \\"big economic issues\\" and that the Conservative Party did not agree with the DUP's stance on several social matters. Commentary in the media also drew attention to the DUP's historic links with the Ulster Resistance, an Ulster loyalist paramilitary movement which was established in Northern Ireland in 1986 by leading members of the party. Emma Little-Pengelly, who was elected DUP MP for Belfast South in the 2017 election, is the daughter of Noel Little, one of the \\"Paris Three\\" arms traffickers arrested in 1989. The former DUP mayor of Ballymoney, Ian Stevenson, attracted criticism when he posted an altered photograph on Twitter showing the flag of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) flying outside 10 Downing Street. Stevenson apologised, claiming that he had confused the flag with the banner of the Apprentice Boys of Derry. The Irish government under outgoing Taoiseach Enda Kenny expressed concerns that a parliamentary deal between a British government and the DUP could put the Northern Ireland peace process at risk, a view also expressed by Sinn F√©in politicians Gerry Adams and Gerry Kelly, Labour MP Yvette Cooper and former Downing Street Director of Communications Alastair Campbell. This opinion was, however, rejected by the Conservative leadership and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, as well as by former Labour minister Caroline Flint who suggested that Gordon Brown may have sought an agreement with the DUP in 2010. The Conservative peer and former UUP First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, described claims that an agreement would put the peace process at risk as \\"scaremongering\\". On 13 June former Conservative Prime Minister John Major publicly urged May to govern without DUP support and not pursue a deal, on the grounds that an agreement could \\"damage\\" the \\"fragile\\" Northern Ireland peace process, suggesting the government must remain 'impartial'. Major himself had an agreement with the Unionist MPs of the UUP when in power and during peace negotiations in Northern Ireland, though not with the more hardline and socially-conservative DUP. On 15 June Sinn F√©in's Gerry Adams met with Theresa May, telling her that he thought she was in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. This has been disputed by one of the UUP's negotiators for the Belfast Agreement. An online petition against the Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement, which also calls for Theresa May's resignation, surpassed 640,000 signatures in the days following the election. The chairman of the NI Conservatives, Alan Dunlop, in contrast stated he was \\"quite happy\\" with the arrangements, commenting that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs either put up with the DUP or get Jeremy Corbyn‚Äù. Whilst acknowledging that some members of the party were dissatisfied with the alliance, he iterated that the alliance did not require the two parties to share the same views. The agreement On 26 June 2017, Downing Street announced that a final agreement between the DUP and the Conservatives had been finalised and signed by Gavin Williamson for the Conservatives and Jeffrey Donaldson for the DUP, the two parties' Chief Whips, in the presence of the two party leaders. The arrangement will see Theresa May lead a minority Conservative government supported legislatively by the DUP. The agreement was published the same day, a form of contract parliamentarism. It will see the DUP support the Conservative minority government on all votes in the UK Parliament relating to the following issues for the duration of the parliament: *All motions of confidence *The Queen's Speech *The Budget *Finance bills, money bills and appropriation legislation *Legislation pertaining to the UK's exit from the European Union *Legislation pertaining to national security Other key points of the agreement include: *The ongoing commitment of the Conservative Party to the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *The UK's 2% defence spending target will continue to be met, in accordance with NATO requirements *Cash support for farmers will remain at current levels until the next election *Both parties agree to adhere to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement *No poll or referendum on the future of Northern Ireland's constitutional status will be held without the \\"consent of the people\\" *The commitment of the DUP to work towards the formation of a new Northern Ireland Executive; and the commitment of the UK Government to work with Northern Irish parties and the Irish government on this objective *Implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland The agreement stated that votes related to any other matters in the Commons will be agreed on a case-by-case basis, overseen by a coordination committee made up of both parties. The DUP secured an extra ¬£1 billion of funding for Northern Ireland, with the money focused on health, infrastructure and education budgets. Following the announcement of the agreement, the Government stated that this additional funding would not result in increased budgets in Scotland or Wales, as the money will not be subject to the Barnett formula. The deal also saw the Conservatives drop their 2017 manifesto commitments to pension and winter fuel allowance changes. Reactions to the agreement The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said that the agreement was \\"good for Northern Ireland and the UK\\". Others have questioned whether or not the UK Government can maintain its role as neutral arbiter of the Good Friday Agreement if its survival depends on the cooperation of a specific unionist political party from Northern Ireland.The Andrew Marr Show, BBC1, 11 June 2017 The DUP-Conservative deal itself came about with the background of a Northern Ireland Assembly which had been suspended since 26 January 2017, with talks to form a power-sharing executive after the latest Assembly election on 2 March yet to prove fruitful. Sinn F√©in leader Martin McGuinness claimed that Theresa May was herself already in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and that the new deal could further hamper the formation of a power-sharing executive. He further added in an op-ed to the Guardian that the agreement's provisions for guaranteed funding were taking place after the loss of over a billion pounds over the past 10 years for Northern Ireland and with a Conservative Party whose political agenda (such as pledges to repeal the Human Rights Act and put an end to the European Court of Justice and the European Convention on Human Rights jurisdiction in the UK) was, in his opinion, at odds with the foundations of a shared and peaceful future for Northern Ireland under the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement. The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was critical of the deal, saying that he believed that the \\"Tory-DUP deal is clearly not in the national interest but in May‚Äôs party‚Äôs interest to help her cling to power\\". The outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, also criticised it, saying \\"The public will not be duped by this shoddy little deal. While our schools are crumbling and our NHS is in crisis, Theresa May chooses to throw cash at ten MPs in a grubby attempt to keep her cabinet squatting in Number 10\\". The funding implications of the deal were criticised by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who was quoted as saying it was an \\"outrageous straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office\\" adding that the Prime Minister must have discovered a \\"magic money tree\\" to provide ¬£1 billion just for Northern Ireland, and described the deal as essentially \\"cash for votes\\". The leader of Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, echoed these sentiments, describing the deal as a \\"bribe\\". In response, former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the deal was \\"the cost of doing business\\" to keep his party in power. There was particular criticism that the additional spending in Northern Ireland will not lead to matched additional funding in other parts of the country through the Barnett formula. Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, stated that it was \\"absurd\\" to criticise UK government spending in addition to the Barnett in Northern Ireland, when \\"the exact same thing happens in Scotland\\". After signing of agreement In September 2017, the DUP broke with the Conservatives for the first time since the signing of the agreement in order to back non-binding Labour motions on the issues of university tuition fees and pay for NHS employees. DUP Chief Whip Jeffrey Donaldson insisted the vote \\"doesn't threaten the deal\\", and noted that the party \\"[reserves] the right to vote on the basis of our own manifesto\\" in their agreement with the government. Later that month, Environment Secretary Michael Gove headlined a fundraising event for the DUP hosted by Ian Paisley Jr. In October 2017, Foster and the DUP MPs held another reception at the Conservative Party conference, which was attended by leading Conservative figures including First Secretary of State Damian Green, Brexit Secretary David Davis, Chief Whip Gavin Williamson, and party chairman Patrick McLoughlin. This was reciprocated in November, when Damian Green and Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith attended the DUP's conference, with Smith giving a keynote address. During February 2018, former International Development Secretary Priti Patel also headlined a DUP fundraising event hosted by Paisley, while Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis addressed a constituency dinner hosted by DUP MP Jim Shannon. Shannon claimed Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom and Sports Minister Tracey Crouch had also attended his fundraising events in the past In September 2018, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson attended a DUP fundraising dinner hosted by Foster. In October 2018, Foster and DUP MPs again hosted their annual reception at the Conservative Party conference. The following month, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addressed the DUP conference. In January 2019, former European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke at a DUP fundraiser at the invitation of Paisley, after declining a similar invitation to fundraise for the Northern Ireland Conservatives. ==2018‚Äì2019: Brexit withdrawal agreement== The Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May's government, and the revised agreement by Boris Johnson's government were both not supported by the DUP, who voted against the legislation in the House of Commons. == See also== * Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition agreement * Lib‚ÄìLab pact * Lib‚ÄìCon pact * Unionist government, 1895‚Äì1905 == References == Category:2017 in British politics Category:Coalition governments of the United Kingdom Category:Democratic Unionist Party Category:History of the Conservative Party (UK) ","title":"Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement"},{"id":"54260804","text":"is a Japanese football player for Braga B.https://www.jleague.jp/club/kashiwa/player/detail/1600175/ ==Career== On 25 January 2019, Anzai joined the reserve team of SC Braga, signing a 2,5-year contract.Kaito Anzai √© refor√ßo da Legi√£o, scbraga.pt, 25 January 2019 ==Club statistics== Updated to 23 February 2018.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë„Éè„É≥„Éá„Ç£Áâà 2018 (NSK MOOK)\\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 196 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"2017 J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë (NSK MOOK)\\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 68 out of 289) {  center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

In some counties the chief magistrate may be authorized to appoint one or more additional magistrates to assist in carrying out the chief magistrate's duties. In some Georgia counties the Probate Court Judge also presides over magistrate court as Chief Magistrate. The enabling legislation does not require magistrates to be licensed attorneys and most Magistrates in Georgia are not required licensed attorneys, however, local legislation in certain counties requires that either the chief magistrate or all of the magistrates be licensed attorneys so some counties have both attorneys and non-attorneys on the magistrate court bench. The state also created a Georgia Magistrate Council to assist magistrates in understanding and carrying out their duties.Website of the Georgia Magistrate Council. ==County Magistrates in Kentucky== In many counties in Kentucky, Magistrates are elected every four years to the County's Fiscal Court.Boone County, Kentucky Fiscal Court A Fiscal Court is led by an elected County Judge-Executive and is equivalent to a County Commission. A Kentucky County is separated into districts, and the citizens of each district elects a Magistrate to serve on this court. Under Kentucky's first constitution, Fiscal Courts were in charge of all judicial and legislative powers of a county. In the present constitution the Fiscal Court is only designated to carry out legislative powers, while the Judge-Executive carries out the executive powers of the county. In some counties in Kentucky, the magistrates no longer sit on the Fiscal Court, having been replaced by three at-large County Commissioners, along with the County Judge/Executive. In these counties, magistrates are still elected, however their duties are limited to the performance of marriage ceremonies. ==Magistrates in North Carolina== In North Carolina, magistrates are officers of District Court. Most magistrates are not lawyers.. In criminal cases, a magistrate may issue warrants, set bail, accept guilty pleas, and so forth. In civil cases, the most common duty of a magistrate is to preside over small claims court. .. ==Magistrates in Ohio== In Ohio, magistrates are appointed by the judges of many municipal courts, domestic relations and juvenile courts, and some courts of appeals and common pleas courts.Ohio Association of Magistrates. In addition, to avoid any conflict of interest, most communities with mayor's courts have magistrates preside over sessions, rather than the mayors themselves. Ohio magistrates do virtually everything judges do. Their actions are subject to review and either approval, modification or reversal by judges of their court. The exception is mayor's court magistrates. Upon the timely notice of appeal from a conviction in a Mayor's Court, the proceeding before either the county or municipal court of the county in which the community is located is de novo. ==Magistrates in Pennsylvania== Pennsylvania has magisterial district judges, Philadelphia Arraignment Magistrates, and Pittsburgh Municipal Magistrates. Magisterial district judges are elected for six-year terms by the electors in the district that the magistrate judge serves. They serve alone in districts apportioned by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and exercise statewide jurisdiction, with limitations. They conduct criminal arraignments and preliminary hearings, issue arrest warrants and search warrants in some cases, hear civil disputes involving $12,000.00 or less, Landlord-Tenant disputes, except not matters involving title to real estate, issue temporary Protection from Abuse Act orders, decide traffic, game law, and fish and boat code cases, conduct marriages, administer oaths and affirmations, etc. They are state employees and supervise staffs which are county employees.

They preside over civil and criminal cases, issue restraining orders, search and arrest warrants and conduct bond hearings (except as to a limited number of the most serious offenses such as murder), preliminary hearings, bench and jury trials. There are over 300 magistrates in the state, the majority of which have had no prior training in law. There are currently bills in the state Senate to reform how magistrates are chosen. Magistrates have jurisdiction in civil cases when the amount in controversy does not exceed $7,500 per side (example: Plaintiff sues for $7500 and Defendant counterclaims for $7500), in traffic and criminal cases (offenses carry a penalty range from 1 day up to 3 years, although most are 30 days) and Landlord-Tenant cases with no limit on the dollar amount involved.

He went on to start his own architecture firm, Architropolis, where he designed homes for celebrities including Lenny Kravitz, a onetime friend and neighbor, and Cindy Crawford. He also designed high-end hotels, including the W Hotel in Miami, and Las Vegas casinos. He later left his design and architect career, to design a high-performance racing motorcycle and formed MotoCzysz. He wanted to build a world-class, American race bike. The result was the radical MotoCzysz C1, a complete ground-up design, powered by a petrol engine of his own design, built to take on the world. Unfortunately, constant rule changes in MotoGP rendered it ineligible for racing, and the project was eventually scrapped. He then turned his attention to electric motorcycles. He created the MotoCzysz E1pc, which made history at the Isle of Man TT, winning the inaugural TT Zero electric motorcycle race in 2010, as well as the next three after that.

A member of the Labour Party, she was first elected to Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council in 2006, later leading the council's opposition group. ==Early life and education== Dent Coad was born in Stepney, the youngest of six children. Her father, Charles Enrique Dent CBE, was a professor of medicine of half Spanish descent, and her mother, Margaret Ruth Coad, was an Anglican vicar's daughter who converted to Catholicism to marry him. She went to Sacred Heart High School, a selective grammar school in Hammersmith, London. She graduated from the Royal College of Art with an MA in History of Design in 1992. Dent Coad has written or contributed to a number of books on architecture and design, including on Javier Mariscal, and is studying at the University of Liverpool School of Architecture for a PhD on \\"Constructing Modern Spain: Architecture, Politics and Ideology under Franco, 1939‚Äì1975\\", which she put on hold on being elected MP.The Daily Politics, BBC, 13 June 2017 ==Local government career== Dent Coad was elected to Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council in 2006, representing the Golborne ward. She served as leader of the opposition Labour Group on the council from 2014‚Äì15. She held the following memberships: * Kensington and Chelsea TMO, the tenant management organisation which manages the council's housing stock, from 27 June 2008 to 31 October 2012 (council appointed) * Housing and Property Scrutiny Committee in 2013/14 * Planning Applications Committee from May 2013 to June 2017 * Planning Committee since June 2014 to June 2017 * London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. Grenfell Tower fire Just days after Dent Coad's election, the Grenfell Tower fire took place in her then constituency. On 16 June, she blamed the Kensington and Chelsea council for failings which led to the fire. Dent Coad considers the fire an \\"entirely preventable\\" tragedy. Dent Coad said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help thinking that poor quality materials and construction standards may have played a part in this hideous and unforgivable event.‚Äù Dent Coad links the council's intention to redevelop the area to the tragedy, she said, ‚ÄúThe council want to develop this area full of social housing, and in order to enable that they have prettified a building that they felt was ugly ... The idea that that has led to this horrendous tragedy is just unthinkable.‚Äù She is campaigning for permanent new homes in the area for victims of the tragedy rather than, \\"some mucky bedsit\\". She has added ‚ÄúPeople are very afraid of what is going to happen next. They need to be kept within Kensington. The fear I was hearing yesterday was \\"they‚Äôre going to send us to Peterborough or to Hastings\\", all the other places that the council has tried to send them before. People want to stay near their networks where their children go to school, where their families are.‚Äù Poverty in Kensington and the fire were the subjects of her maiden speech in the House of Commons on 22 June 2017.Details: * * * On 4 July 2017, Dent Coad said that residents had no confidence in Sir Martin Moore-Bick to lead the Grenfell Tower Fire Inquiry, describing him as \\"a technocrat\\" who lacked \\"credibility\\". She supports calls for \\"reparations\\" to the community in the form of restoring local assets and services such as a college and a library which are under threat, and claims that many on the council see those in social housing as \\"lesser beings.\\" Dent Coad supports a call for the leaders of Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to resign so that there can be fresh elections. Her predecessor, Victoria Borwick, has claimed she shares \\"collective responsibility\\" for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment, since Dent Coad had (until October 2012) sat on the board of the Kensington and Chelsea TMO which managed the tower. In a council meeting on 8 November 2012, Dent Coad praised the refurbishment announcement of the Grenfell Tower which she said showed that the council had listened to residents. This is usually taken to mean the refurbishment that include installing the cladding, however as the cladding was installed in the summer of 2016 and the praise was at a 2012 meeting this is wrong. However, Dent Coad has asked Borwick to retract this claim, arguing that she supported refurbishment in principle to respond to complaints about conditions, but left the TMO around the time that the broad principles of the refurbishment were agreed. She was not present when Rydon was provided with the contract, or when the decision was reportedly taken to save money on external cladding. In a 2014/15 report, in which Dent Coad's name appears, it is reported that the housing scrutiny committee looked at the refurbishment. It is often used to ascribe responsibility to Dent Coad for the cladding, even though the cladding was installed May‚ÄìJune 2016 so the report is actually about a completely different refurbishment. Facing the claim that she was partly responsible, she angrily refuted the accusation, saying: \\"I didn‚Äôt make any of the decisions. I didn‚Äôt sign the document,\\". Dent Coad issued a detailed rebuttal via a local blog, From the Hornet's Nest, refuting the most common accusations. Dent Coad is critical of Universal Credit generally and is also critical of a decision to roll out Universal Credit in Kensington shortly before Christmas 2018. Claimants must wait five weeks for the first payment which Dent Coad maintains is unacceptable. Dent Coad does not want yet more pain inflicted on families that have, \\"already lost so much\\" in the Grenfell fire. Dent Coad said, \\"It's unthinkable, they're going to have another Christmas now wondering whether they can afford to buy food, let alone presents for their children.\\" Dent Coad stated that asking for advances for Christmas would result in people experiencing, \\"many future months without enough income to cover their expenses\\". ==Parliamentary career== Dent Coad was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kensington at the 2017 snap election when she defeated the sitting Conservative MP Victoria Borwick, with a majority of 20 votes, overturning a 7,361 majority from the previous election two years earlier. The declaration was made after three recounts, and was the final result declared of the 2017 UK general election. Dent Coad supported Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. She identifies as a socialist and is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs. On 29 June 2017, Dent Coad voted against the Labour party whip and for an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling for the UK's continued membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union following Brexit. Dent Coad has stated that she \\"will always campaign to remain in the EU\\" as \\"[her] wish for Kensington and for the country is to stay within the EU, reform regulations that do not work for us, and spend revenue fairly across the country.\\" Dent Coad is a republican: she joined pressure group Republic in 2005 and is a former board member. In June 2018, she suggested that the Royal family move out of Buckingham Palace and that it should be open to public access, given the public contribution of one third of a billion pounds to its cost of refurbishment. In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Dent Coad was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate Felicity Buchan, who at 17,768 votes had a majority over Dent Coad of 150.\\"Election of a Member of Parliament for Kensington on Thursday 12 December 2019\\", Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea website, accessed 22 December 2019. ==Criticism== In 2010, Dent Coad published on her blog a drawing of a stick man being hanged from a gallows superimposed on the Conservative Party logo. Conservative MP for Saffron Walden, Kemi Badenoch commented: \\"Words fail me ... It actually looks like a black conservative hanging from a tree.\\" In September 2017, Dent Coad was the subject of press criticism for comments about Prince Harry and his role as a British Army Apache helicopter pilot which she then withdrew. She later said that her remarks had been \\"a joke\\" which had been \\"taken the wrong way\\". In November 2017, Dent Coad was criticised for retweeting a post on Twitter using a quote from Roald Dahl's children's book The Twits to suggest that the Prime Minister Theresa May was 'ugly' due to her 'ugly thoughts', whereas Jeremy Corbyn had 'good thoughts' and was 'lovely'. Conservative MP George Freeman said: \\"The re-appearance of misogyny & racial prejudice in Corbyn's Labour Party isn't a surprise\\". In November 2017, it emerged that Dent Coad had, in 2010, described Shaun Bailey, then a Conservative parliamentary candidate, now a London Assembly member, as a ‚Äútoken ghetto boy‚Äù. In the same blog post, she quoted an anonymous former neighbour of Bailey who had described him as a ‚Äúfree-loading scumbag‚Äù. She wrote that Bailey was being ‚Äúused‚Äù by the Conservative Party and asked \\"Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries?‚Äù She proceeded to state that if Bailey were to win his seat ‚Äúhe will no longer be welcome in North Ken[sington]‚Äù. Bailey subsequently called the comments \\"racist\\" and \\"hate-filled\\". Dent Coad later apologised for \\"any offence caused\\". ==Personal life== Dent Coad was married to Sir Hadley Gregory D'Oyly, 15th Baronet from 1978 to 1982. In 1984, she married David Blott, with whom she had three children; the couple divorced in 1997. She has lived in North Kensington since 1986. After the 2019 United Kingdom general election, she announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer on 14 November 2019, and had surgery to remove it on 9 December. Dent Coad stated that she had not announced her diagnosis earlier as she did not want to impact her re-election campaign. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Emma Dent Coad personal blog * * at Official Jeremy Corbyn Channel Category:1954 births Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art Category:Alumni of the University of Liverpool Category:Councillors in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:English people of Spanish descent Category:English republicans Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Living people Category:People educated at Sacred Heart High School, Hammersmith Category:People from Stepney Category:People from Chelsea, London Category:People from Kensington Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:British republicans Category:English socialists Category:Wives of baronets ","title":"Emma Dent Coad"},{"id":"54261057","text":"Elene Khoshtaria (born November 18, 1979 in Tbilisi) is a Georgian politician and the Member of the Parliament of Georgia since 2016.

It is mainly used for terrestrial planets where liquids may be present, in which tidal locking will induce a spatially dependent temperature gradient (the planet will be hotter on the side facing the star and colder on the other side). This temperature gradient may therefore limit the places in which liquid may exist on the surface of the planet to ring-or disk-shaped areas. Such planets are further divided into \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" eyeball planets, depending on which side of the planet the liquid is present. A \\"hot\\" eyeball planet is usually closer to its host star, and the centre of the \\"eye\\", facing the star (day side), is made of rock while liquid is present on the opposite side (night side). A \\"cold\\" eyeball planet, usually farther from the star, will have liquid on the side facing the host star while the rest of its surface is made of ice and rocks. Because most planetary bodies have a natural tendency toward becoming tidally locked to their host body on a long enough timeline, it is thought that eyeball planets may be common and could possibly host life, particularly in planetary systems orbiting red and brown dwarf stars which have lifespans much longer than other main sequence stars. == Potential Candidates == Kepler Object of Interest 2626-01 is potentially an eyeball planet.

The film was directed by David Leitch from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, with Ryan Reynolds starring as Deadpool. In No Good Deed, Wade Wilson tries to save an old man from a mugger, but fails because he takes the time to change into his Deadpool costume first. Shortly before the release of the 2017 film Logan, its theatrical runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the feature film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version. No Good Deed was originally released by 20th Century Fox in front of Logan on March 3, 2017, and an alternate version of the short was released online by Reynolds the following day. Responses to the short praised it as a tease for Deadpool 2 and for showing that Leitch understands the character ahead of directing that film. Its humor was also highlighted by many critics. ==Plot== Wade Wilson comes across an old man being mugged in an alley, and races to change into his Deadpool costume before he helps the man. As Wilson struggles to get dressed in a nearby phone booth, the man is shot. Wilson emerges, wearing his costume, only to find the man dead and the mugger long gone. ==Production== Ryan Reynolds reprises the role of Deadpool from the films David Leitch directed a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which was believed to be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to \\"make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There was nothing else to say, because we had said it.\\" Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films. After the initial release, Reese quickly clarified that the scene was not intended to be an official trailer for Deadpool 2, with none of its footage meant to appear in that film, instead being a standalone short film that serves as a \\"tonal tease\\" for Deadpool 2. Two slightly different versions of the short were created, with the intention of giving \\"theater- goers and internet users slightly different treats.\\" For the online release, Reynolds simply titled the short No Good Deed. That version of the short sees Stan Lee make a cameo appearance as himself. The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' theme from the 1978 film playing as Wilson changes in the booth. It was noted that Leitch's \\"icy blue\\" cinematography differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said \\"every director brings their take to the material\\" and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted the opening of the short to feel like the opening of Logan, \\"so if you were going to see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [Jackman] in the hoodie, and then when it turns out to be Deadpool you realize what's going on.\\" They described the short as an absurd one-off \\"that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there.\\" The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters. ==Release== No Good Deed was shown in front of Logan in North America theaters beginning March 3, 2017, distributed by 20th Century Fox. The short was only approved for theatrical release in India as intended because the view of Reynolds' buttocks in the short, as Wilson changes into his Deadpool costume, is blurred by the telephone booth windows. Reynolds released the online version of the short on YouTube on March 4, with the video description \\"Wade and the other girls from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants plan a trip to Cabot Cove.\\" Within 48 hours, the video had been viewed over 12 million times. When Deadpool 2 was released to home media in August 2018, No Good Deed was included in the bonus extras under Deadpool's Fun Sack 2. ==Reception== Chris Cabin at Collider called the short film \\"dark, funny, and just a bit punkish\\", and compared it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He thought it was a smart move from Fox to release \\"a taste of what [fans] love\\" about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and \\"a great way to keep the buzz going for\\" Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was \\"not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company\\", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was \\"a fun one\\", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, \\"At the very least, [this shows that] we can expect the same irreverent humor in\\" Deadpool 2 as was in the first film. Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, regardless of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it \\"ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun.\\" Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short \\"a fun little scene\\", and said that Leitch \\"certainly seems to have a solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well.\\" Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a \\"fun little surprise\\" and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is \\"not much to judge quite yet, but [Leitch] does showcase a strong eye for comedy\\" in the footage, and particularly noted the \\"ridiculously depressing and dilapidated\\" setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is \\"certainly cool enough to wet the palate for any X-Men fans\\", and particularly noted the \\"strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool. With a new director stepping behind the camera, perhaps this was a choice that we'll see in\\" Deadpool 2. There was speculation among fans that the murdered old man in the short could be Ben Parker, the uncle of Marvel character Spider-Man who is killed by a mugger as part of that hero's origin story. The speculation noted the way the old man is killed in the short, and the fact that he is carrying Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In response to this, Leitch \\"coyly\\" said, \\"That's a really interesting question\\", adding, \\"I think that people should continue to theorize who that old man was.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2017 films Category:2010s action comedy films Category:2017 black comedy films Category:2010s superhero films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American action comedy films Category:American black comedy films Category:American films Category:Deadpool films Category:Depictions of Stan Lee on film Category:Films directed by David Leitch Category:Short films based on Marvel Comics Category:American short films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:Metafictional works Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Wernick Category:Films with screenplays by Rhett Reese Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Superhero comedy films ","title":"No Good Deed (2017 film)"},{"id":"54261293","text":"Chiappini is an Italian surname.

Since 1995, the meeting has been held annually with the exception of 2006. The event is mostly held in June but has been moved to May and July in previous years because of special circumstances. The inaugural Europa-Forum Wachau took place in 1995, the same year that Austria entered the European Union, with the purpose to strengthen closeness to citizens and to serve as an impulse and discussion platform for political decisions concerning Europe.Europa-Forum Wachau (Hrsg.): 5 Jahre Europa-Forum Wachau. 1995 bis 1999.

Brigitte Karner, 1999, S. 15 The discussion meeting is held by the club \\"Europa-Forum Wachau\\" in partnership with the \\"Federal Ministry for european and international matters\\" and the land government of Lower Austria. The event focuses on political developments of the danube region. Special attention goes to security related, regional, economical and cultural topics. The Austrian publicist and host Paul Lendvai has been hosting the discussion event since its inauguration in 1995. Over the years many famous European politicians attended the Europa-Forum. == Founding and organisation == host Paul Lendvai The annually held Europa-Forum was founded with the goal to intensify the European thought. A big reason for this was the 1994 Austrian European Union membership referendum on 12 June 1994.

Always attending in the first ten years were then governor of Lower Austria Erwin Pr√∂ll and then federal chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel. One of the many goals is to make a contribution to the European mutual consent. After the extension of the EU by ten more member states, Lower Austria was shifted into the center of the European Union, both politically and geographically. Step by step, borders to neighbouring countries like Czech Republic and Slovakia were made possible. Because of this, Lower Austria held a Three-Countries-Day with its neighbours.

In 2016, students of St. P√∂lten University of Applied Sciences created four different PR concepts for the Europa-Forum Wachau, which focused on social media and press activities before, during and after the event. The goal was to communicate the message of Europa-Forum more broadly through technical means.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Walsall North since 2017. ==Early life and career== Hughes was born on 3 October 1968 in Birmingham, England. His father was a bus driver and his mother was a cleaner. He has five brothers and attended Handsworth Grammar School (now King Edward VI Handsworth Grammar School for Boys). Hughes studied civil engineering at the University of Glamorgan. He had previously been deputy chief executive of a local charity which provides accommodation for young people and a trustee of the Walsall Wood Allotment Charity, which helps people in financial need. Hughes served on the West Midlands Police Authority and was chairman of Walsall Housing Group until June 2018. He stood for the Pheasey ward on Walsall Council in 1998, but was unsuccessful. He was, however, elected as a councillor for the Hatherson Rushall ward on Walsall Council in 1999, gaining the seat from Labour, until 2004 when boundary changes occurred and he was elected a councillor for Streetly ward, where he continued to be re-elected until he stood down shortly after he was elected as an MP.http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/Walsall-1973-2012.pdf He has held several positions on the council including the decision-making cabinet, chairman of Children's Services Scrutiny and Audit committees. He was chairman of WHG, the only MP who at the time was the chair of a housing association. ==Parliamentary career== Hughes was elected the MP for Walsall North at the 2017 general election, where he unseated the sitting veteran Labour Party MP David Winnick. Winnick, aged 83 at the time, had held the seat for the previous 38 years, since the 1979 general election. Hughes introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill into the House of Commons to improve tenant safety around carbon monoxide poisoning. It received a first reading on 13 September 2017. Hughes spoke in the Commons during a debate on NHS pay in September 2017, stating that the starting salary for a newly qualified nurse was higher than that of the average constituent of Walsall North, in defending not lifting a below inflation cap of 1% on public-sector pay increases. He said it was his job to stick up for everyone, not just people in the public sector, which caused some controversy. Despite his intervention, the opposition motion to lift the cap was passed. The Conservative Government subsequently announced, in March 2018, that they would end the cap on NHS salaries. Hughes has campaigned for more front line police on the streets and raised the issue with Theresa May in the House of Commons. He is a supporter of Brexit, campaigning for a leave vote, and was one of 62 Conservative MPs who wrote to the Prime Minister urging support for her Lancaster House speech. Since being elected in June 2017 Hughes had campaigned for funding for a new A&E; department at Walsall Manor Hospital, including raising the issue with the Prime Minister at PMQs. Funding of ¬£36m was eventually allocated by the Department for Health & Social Care in December 2018. Hughes is a member of the Consolidation Bills Committee and the Women & Equalities Select Committee. Hughes was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the ministerial team of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in June 2018. During his time as PPS at MHLG Hughes was responsible for liaising with parliamentary colleagues in respect of revisions to the National Planning Policy Framework which was subsequently published in July 2018. He subsequently moved with Dominic Raab to the Department for Exiting the European Union. He resigned to vote against the Withdrawal Agreement on 15 January 2019. As chair of the APPG for Excellence in the Built Environment Hughes chaired the committee's inquiry into the need for a New Homes Ombudsman which was published in June 2018. In October 2018 the government announced that there will be a New Homes Ombudsman ‚Äì \\"a watchdog that will champion homebuyers, protect their interests and hold developers to account.\\" == Other political work == Hughes works with libertarian Conservative think tank Freer UK, with whom he released a report on blockchain technologies, advocating that the UK government appoint a Chief Blockchain Officer. The Financial Times criticised the paper at length. ==Personal life== He married Clare in 2014. Hughes has a son and daughter from a previous marriage. She works for phs Direct, a commercial supplier of consumables. His brother Des was a Labour councillor.

Sailing for the Straits of Malacca they took several small Moorish ships which were ‚Äúbut of little value to them.‚Äù Finally in 1699 they captured a large Danish ship, which they took to the Nicobars for use in careening the Dolphin.

Shortly afterwards a squadron of British warships under Commodore Thomas Warren arrived, offering clemency to all pirates who renounced their ways. Culliford and some others accepted the offer; North fled in a longboat, later joining John Halsey, and Booth escaped to sail with John Bowen. Inless himself refused the pardon and burned the Dolphin, but his ultimate fate is unknown. ==See also== *James Littleton - succeeded Warren (who dies in 1699) as Commodore, and returned to Madagascar to finish dealing with the pirates. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Caribbean pirates Category:18th-century pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"Samuel Inless"},{"id":"54261346","text":"Grassland accounts for China‚Äôs largest land resource, covering nearly 41 percent of the national land area. Grassland in the Chinese context comprises widely varying eco-types ranging from the meadows and forest steppes of former Manchuria in the Northeast; and the high, alpine pastures of the Qinghai- Tibetan plateau; to the (semi)arid steppes and deserts in China‚Äôs Great West. Due to this geographical and ecological variety, the utilization of grassland is not limited to grazing and forage production, but extends to the exploitation of grassland and forest by-products, as well as the exploitation of mineral resources. Of the total of around 393 million hectares of grassland in China, 84 percent or 331 million hectares is deemed usable for grazing. == Degradation == In the arid and semi-arid regions, large tracts of grassland consist of steppe, semi-desert or desert, with low or very low forage production. It is believed that a major proportion of China‚Äôs grasslands have been degraded or desertified to varying degrees. A variety of causes for grassland degradation has been identified, which include overgrazing, overpopulation, mining, agricultural reclamation, pests and rodents, geophysical change, climate change and variability. It needs to be noted that there is contention about the extent to which degradation has taken or is taking place. Some have also posited that Chinese statistics over grassland degradation are politicized and need reinterpretation in the light of larger ethnic, geo-political and strategic interests. In this regard, non-equilibrium range ecology posits that under conditions of high precipitation variability, the human factor becomes secondary to abiotic factors in influencing desertification and grassland degradation. == Legal status == Grasslands were legally made public property during the Land Reform in the 1950s, albeit without an existing definition of what constitutes public ownership, and only well after the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution were grasslands redefined as state-owned in the 1982 constitution. Further grassland reform came as part of the 1980s market reform, which started in the rural agricultural areas, but also included rangelands through a controversial path of privatizing grazing animals and the use rights of state-owned pastures. Although currently the Chinese state nationalized grasslands, their ownership is still claimed by the collectives, while the mining of the grasslands‚Äô subsoil resources has remained a Daedalean collusion of state, collective and private interests. == Grassland policies ==  Pasture Household Contract Responsibility System  The 1985 Rangeland Law defined the Pasture Household Contract Responsibility System (short: the Pasture Contract System) under which individuals and collectives could contract collective or state rangeland. The Ministry of Agriculture envisioned four different stages in putting the pasture contract system into effect: 1\\\\. The distribution of animals that were formerly owned by the collective to individual households. 2\\\\. The assessment, or in some cases re-assessment, of range boundaries between collectives and the consequent allocation of rangeland user rights to collectives and households. 3\\\\. The appraisal of the pastures in terms of carrying capacities or stocking rates. 4\\\\. The implementation of a legal system of incentives and penalties to ensure that producers abide by the carrying capacities of the plots of land assigned to them, and the establishment of a supervisory institutional structure to enforce the legal rules and regulations. While these guidelines exist on paper, scholars have questioned the actual practice of the Pasture Contract System. Longworth and Williamson for instance noted that the policy does not exist at the village and household level. It is also found that as long as state and collective ownership of rangeland, and the level of collective ownership are not clarified, the consistency of the pasture contract system is jeopardized. In response to the implementation difficulties of the pasture contract system, scholars and officials within the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture have suggested that the responsibility of management and control for rangelands should be vested in the collective, be it the administrative or natural village, or smaller traditional social groups.  Resettlement of Nomads  The management of grassland frequently reaches into the socioeconomic sphere, in China and elsewhere, touching on matters of regional planning and the sedentarization of nomadic people and pastoralists. The sedentarization of nomadic herders (dingju youmumin) should not be confused with the term 'ecological resettlement' (shengtai yimin), that has often been used interchangeably. In a policy document of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDCR), it was stated that: \\"By settling nomads one can improve their production and living standards, and promote economic growth and social development of the ethnic regions, in order to [‚Ä¶] expel social unrest, and maintain ethnic unity and stability of the border areas\\". This example shows that aside from nature conservation and environmental protection, grassland policies often simultaneously serve wider interests.  Grazing Ban  According to numerous government reports, China‚Äôs grasslands are suffering from serious overgrazing, leading to degradation and desertification. In response to this, the state has issued a strict prohibition on grazing where pastoralism and livestock farmers are prohibited from grazing livestock on grassland in place of stall-feeding. To compensate for the loss of income, herders are entitled to subsidies based on a flat rate of 6 RMB per mu of pasture. The Grazing Ban was adopted as national policy for the first time in 2000 and later encoded in the revised Grassland Law in 2002 (article 35, section 2). In following years, the Grazing Ban was merged with additional programs including the ‚ÄòHerds for Grass Program‚Äô (in 2005) and the ‚ÄòPayment for Grassland Services‚Äô (2011). Due to the Grazing Ban‚Äôs merging with other policies, there is considerable confusion regarding its relation with the Herds for Grass Program (of which it is a part) and the Payment for Grassland Services (to which it is an addition). The Grazing Ban and its implementation have been received in overly negative terms. With only a few exceptions, the Grazing Ban has been unfavorably evaluated by a variety of studies. Reasons for failure include the ill-adapted nature to ecological realities of the pastoral area and its commandist or top- down manner of implementation. Other problems are found in the administration, standards and payment of subsidies, along with rent-seeking by local cadres and adverse effects on income and livelihood. It is found that the ban has a lack of credibility and has been subject to rural disobedience through clandestine grazing during the night or at remote locations. == References == Category:Environment of China Category:Geography of China ","title":"Grasslands of China"},{"id":"54261368","text":"The Way Out Alliance (; YELK Dashink, YELQ) or Yelk Alliance or simply Yelk or Way Out was a liberal political alliance of three political parties in Armenia: Civil Contract, Bright Armenia and the Hanrapetutyun Party.

From then on Mayr dramatises the text via a sequence of recitatives (mainly accompanied) and arias. Part 2, at the foot of the Cross, follows a similar pattern and finishes with a final chorus. The key word here is dramatises. This is a dramatic, almost operatic work. Not for Mayr the quiet contemplation of the more Germanic oratorios. The opening sinfonia is surprisingly cheerful and would not come amiss as the overture to an opera buffo; evidently this is meant to suggest Victory over Death. The following chorus is also very operatic, intermingling chorus with solo interjections. Mayr's style hovers between the world familiar to Mozart and Haydn and the style that was to become the early 19th Century Italian opera.\\" ==References== Category:1794 compositions Category:Oratorios by Simon Mayr ","title":"La passione (Mayr)"},{"id":"54261556","text":"Emily Jane Lloyd (1860 - 14 November 1912) was an English chemist and one of the first women to become an Associate member of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. == Early life and education == Mason Science College where she attended She was the daughter of Martin Lloyd, a nail manufacturer in Birmingham. She attended a private school in Leamington. Later, she attended Mason Science College for a year in 1883, aged 23, and then transferred to University College, Aberystwyth. She remained at Aberystwyth until 1887. Lloyd is the only female student mentioned in the history of the chemistry department of the University. She then was awarded a B.Sc from the University of London in 1892. During this time, she applied under the name of E.Lloyd to sit the Associateship examination of the Institute of Chemistry.

She obtained her BSc in chemistry from University College London in 1937. == Early career == From 1938 to 1939 French was a demonstrator in chemistry at UCL. As such, she was one of the very few women appointed to the Chemistry Department at University College London before the Second World War. She did research with Christopher Ingold and Cecil Wilson, which helped her achieve her PhD in 1940. This same year, she also she undertook a position in Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a research chemist. In late 1940, she accepted a new job as a demonstrator and assistant lecturer in physical and organic chemistry at Bedford University. However, Bedford had been evacuated to Cambridge University to avoid the heavy bombing that was being faced in London. == Career at Queen Mary's University == alt=The Queens' Building at The Queens' Building at Queen Mary College, where French worked for much of her career. Despite being given many teaching duties, Cecilie started her research in magnetochemistry with James Spencer. As well as Bedford College being evacuated, Queen Mary's College (QMC) was also evacuated to Cambridge which began French's involvement with QMC. After the bombings in London have died down the evacuees returned to Bedford and QMC to London in 1944. At this point she was offered a position as lecturer in Inorganic and Physical Chemistry at QMC. She stayed with QMC for the rest of her life, during which she was promoted to a senior lecturer in 1961. Despite heavy teaching load, French maintained a very impressive research output in magnetochemistry the electrochemistry of nonaqeuous solvents and the synthesising of novel boron compounds. She collaborated on research with Violet Trew at Bedford College until the arrival of the Gouy balance at QMC whereupon she began collaborating with D. Harrison there instead. During her time at QMC, French's tutelage and supervision of twenty-three research graduates also resulted in almost fifty publications. == Later life == French travelled widely over her years in the Far East and in the United States, spending a year in Pennsylvania State University.

Ferst. It was originally a maker of writing instruments but it now produces butane lighters. At one time it was the largest producer of writing instruments in the world. Despite the aforesaid statement that Scripto no longer produces writing instruments, the fact is that ballpoint pens bearing the Scripto name and logo are presently being produced as of 2019, primarily for use as advertising promotional pens. There are a number of vendors of promotional products, both on Internet online and in printed catalogs, that sell Scripto pens in bulk to businesses, with customized promotional imprints. ==History== Early years Scripto thick graphite leads The company was originally known as the M.A. Ferst Company until changing its name to Scripto, Latin for \\"I write\\", in 1924. Ferst sold mechanical pencils, pens, and pencils as well as their refillables. Ferst increased his sales ability by adding advertising (such as customer names) and commemorative memorabilia to his product line. In 1939, the company produced bat shaped mechanical pencils to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of baseball. In 1931, the company built a manufacturing plant on Houston Street in Atlanta. During World War II Scripto became part of the war effort. At first, the company polished 75mm brass cannon shells. It then received a contract to manufacture ammunition pieces worth $1,094,000. This contract required the company to build a new factory and hire at least 250 to 300 new employees. In 1947, the company hired James V. Carmichael as its president. Under Carmichael, the company became an international business and was the largest producer of writing instruments in the world. He would remain president until 1964 and stayed on the board of directors for several years later. During this time the company would go on to have production centers in Australia, Canada, England, and Southern Rhodesia. Lighters In 1955, the company began selling refillable lighters. Its first lighter model was called the Vu-Lighter. Two years later the company acquired the Anja Engineering Corporation, a California company that also produced writing instruments and printed material. By this time, the company had expanded its facilities between Houston and Irwin Streets and built office and research facilities on Boulevard Street. ICWU Strike Beginning in 1963, the International Chemical Workers Union (ICWU) organized Scripto's workers into the union and the National Labor Relations Board recognized their representation on June 9, 1964. At the time Scripto had 950 employees, of which 836 were production or maintenance workers. 633 of the production and maintenance workers were black women. Most of these workers were making $400 per year below the federal poverty limit. The ICWU called for a strike on November 27, 1964 claiming that Scripto's offer for a raise was discriminatory. The company had offered a four percent raise to skilled staff and a two percent raise to production and maintenance staff. At the time, there were six black workers in skilled staff positions and the union claimed that the company wouldn't promote blacks to skilled positions. On November 30, Martin Luther King Jr. and C.T. Vivian informed the company that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) supported the strikers and threatened to lead a boycott of the company's products. The company stated that the proposal was economic and not racially motivated. In December, James V. Carmichael negotiated with the union while King spent two days with the strikers. Vivian worked to form an alliance of the union and civil rights groups that he thought would help the strikers reach their demands. During this time the strike began to take on the feel of a civil rights protest. King walked the picket line with them on December 19 and addressed a rally of 250 strikers at Ebenezer Baptist Church on the 20th stating the SCLC was prepared to move forward with a boycott. On the 24th, the company and union reached their first agreement with the union dropping its boycott and the company paying the strikers their annual Christmas bonuses. On January 9, 1965, Scripto and the ICWU announced a settlement. All employees would receive four cent an hour raised each year for the next three years. The company also agreed to re-hire 155 strikers and keep on their replacement workers. Although racial tensions eased at the plant some Atlanta leaders who had been somewhat sympathetic to King before the strike became less so after the boycott threats. Later in 1965, Carl Singer was brought on as president of the company to oversee a reorganization and a change in direction. End of independence In 1973, Scripto stopped being an independent entity when it was acquired by the British firm Wilkinson Sword which was trying to diversify its interests. The next year, the company began a partnership with the Japanese firm of Tokai-Seiki to sell disposable lighters. In December 1977, the company moved its plant from Atlanta to Gwinnett County, Georgia. By 1978, the company was a subsidiary of Allegheny International, Inc. and K. Douglas Martin was its president. In 1984, Scripto was acquired by Tokai-Seiki which had become the Tokai Corporation. In 1986 the company moved its headquarters to Rancho Cucamonga, California. At the same time, the company's Anja subsidiary built a new facility in Rancho Cucamonga and moved all of its staff there from Monrovia, California. Anja's facility was the first major writing production facility to be built in the United States in twenty years and would produce Scripto pens. The company's name was changed to Scripto-Tokai in 1988 and its headquarters were moved to Fontana, California. Most of its production facilities were moved to Tijuana, Mexico in 1989. The plant in Gwinnett County closed in 1994. Sometime after this the company stopped producing writing instruments and focused on lighters. Today In 2006, the company's name was again changed, this time to Scripto, USA. As of 2017, Scripto is a subsidiary of the Calico brands of Tokai World and only produces lighters. The company is based out of Ontario, California. ==Historic products== Scripto Vu lighter with transparent fluid compartment In 1955, Scripto was the first to introduce what it called Fluidlead. This was a pencil that wrote like a pen using liquid graphite. Another company, Parker Pens, had developed a similar product called Liquid Lead that was a few months behind Scripto in production. To avoid a costly patent fight the two companies agreed to share their formulas with each other on Valentine's Day of that year. In 1980, Scripto produced its first erasable pen. Other writing products included the Pussycat, Feathertone, Satellite, Prestige, Escort, Action, T210, K780, and the K21 pens. The Vu lighter was the first see-through lighter. This allowed the user to see how much lighter fluid was left in it. The Electra lighter, which was introduced in 1985, ignited the lighter fluid with an electric spark instead of the old spark wheel. ==Advertising== Scripto has had several notable people over the years advertise their products. In the 1960s, the company used a jingle by Tony Romeo in its advertising. In 1972, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman appeared in a television advertisement for Scripto pens. Model Genevieve Chappell has appeared in advertisements for Scripto lighters. ==Notable Court Cases== Scripto v. Carson In 1960, the company was involved in the far- reaching court case of Scripto, Inc. v. Carson which was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court decided that the company was liable for collecting use tax in Florida even though it did not have facilities or employees in the state. It did have ten salesmen (who it equipped with catalogs and other items) who had specified territories and were only paid on commission. The court ruled that the company was operating in the state, even though it salesmen were not company employees. Calles v. Scripto-Tokai Corporation In 2003, Scripto was sued in Illinois court after the death of three year old Jillian Calles when a fire was started by a sibling using the Aim N Flame lighter. The family claimed the product was defective because it did not have a child safety device. The trial court dismissed the case saying that Scripto did not violate any laws. The Calles family appealed to the Appellate Court which overruled the trial court's decision. Scripto appealed the Appellate Court's decision, and in 2007 the case made it to the Illinois Supreme Court. Illinois courts used two tests in product safety cases: the Consumer expectations test and the Risk-utility test. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the Aim N Flame passed the Consumer Expectation Test but not the Risk- Utility Test. This ruling affirmed the Appellate Court ruling and sent the case back to trial court. In 2010, Scripto settled the suit for $3.5 million. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1924 Category:1924 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Writing implements Category:Lighters (firelighting) Category:Cigarette lighter brands Category:American companies established in 1924 ","title":"Scripto"},{"id":"54261643","text":"Alexander Aloysius \\"Alan\\" McGuckian SJ (born 26 February 1953) is an Irish Roman Catholic bishop and Jesuit.

She first appeared in the twenty-fourth series episode \\"Russian Endings\\", broadcast on 15 May 2010. Kirsty is a staff nurse in Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED). Gaskell was invited to audition by show producers and was successful. She shadowed ED nurses at a local hospital as preparation for the role. Kirsty is characterised as a strong, independent and feisty nurse, who does the best for her patients. She develops close friendships with her colleagues, notably Adam Trueman (Tristan Gemmill), although Kirsty's brash personality also makes her clash with others. The character's backstory and home life was explored, with her husband, Warren Clements (Stephen Lord), and daughter, Nita Clements (Holly Earl), introduced. Kirsty is central to an issue-led domestic violence storyline, in which Warren abuses Kirsty. Gaskell wanted to raise awareness for the issue and portray several aspects of the storyline. She researched the story by speaking to domestic abuse victims. The story climaxes when Warren dies after a confrontation between him, Kirsty and Nita. Gaskell quit her role after a year of filming with the show and Kirsty departs in the twenty-fifth series episode \\"When You're Smiling\\", broadcast on 30 July 2011. == Casting == On 18 March 2010, it was announced that actress Lucy Gaskell had joined the show's cast as \\"fiery and vivacious mental health nurse\\" Kirsty Clements. Gaskell described the experience as \\"a great big whirlwind\\" and said the cast and crew were welcoming towards her. Series producer, Oliver Kent, expressed his delight at Gaskell's casting, commenting that she will be good for creating the character of Kirsty. Gaskell previously guest starred in Casualty sister show, Holby City, for one episode as a heavily pregnant woman. She recalled that she was required to do \\"a lot of pushing, screaming and throwing up\\". Belinda Campbell, the show's executive producer, requested that Gaskell audition for the role, which she did. At the audition, Gaskell was informed about the character's storylines and how producers wanted to handle the story, which encouraged to pursue the role. The following day, she was offered the job; Gaskell preferred the short wait between auditioning and being offered the role as she found it \\"the worst part of being an actress\\". Gaskell immediately notified her mother of her new role, before informing her friend, actress Georgia Taylor, who portrays Ruth Winters in the serial. In preparation for the role, Gaskell shadowed nurses at the emergency department (ED) of Frenchay Hospital, South Gloucestershire. The actress wore medical scrubs while in the hospital's ED which confused patients as they presumed she was a hospital nurse. She enjoyed shadowing the nurses and felt she learnt a lot from the experience. == Development ==  Characterisation  Kirsty was billed as a brilliant nurse who provides \\"a breath of fresh air\\" and \\"a bucket full of attitude\\" to the ED. BBC also said Kirsty would arrive with a \\"dirty laugh\\", a \\"disregard for authority\\" and \\"loyalty to her patients\\". Kent described Kirsty as a \\"human whirlwind\\". Gaskell named Kirsty the ideal friend who is \\"fun, game for a laugh and a joke with her colleagues\\". Kirsty is a staff nurse who was promoted to senior staff nurse in a different hospital due to her \\"skill, determination and hard work ethic\\". The actress explained that Kirsty's flaw is putting other people before herself and a need to \\"make a difference\\". She called \\"a strong, confident person\\" who is \\"actually rather sensitive and vulnerable\\", which Gaskell believes she can relate to. Kirsty forms good relationships with others, but Gaskell said that the character will defend herself and others if she believes they are not being treated fairly. Gaskell told David Collins of TV Choice that Kirsty is a \\"very forgiving person\\". The actress said that in work, Kirsty is a \\"strong, capable woman\\" who can defend others whereas at home, Kirsty is different; she is \\"submissive to her domineering husband\\". Kirsty's backstory states that she married her \\"childhood sweetheart\\" Warren Clements (Stephen Lord) and became pregnant at sixteen with their only child, daughter Nita Clements (Holly Earl).  Friendships  Kirsty grows close to consultant Adam Trueman after she helps a patient, played by Michelle Collins (pictured). Upon her arrival, Kirsty develops good relationships with most of her colleagues, particularly her male colleagues and ED consultant Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker). She impresses ED consultant Adam Trueman, portrayed by Tristan Gemmill, when she helps a grieving patient (Michelle Collins) tackle her grief. Gaskell revealed that Kirsty finds Adam attractive since he is \\"quite different\\" to Warren. Kirsty later shares a one-off kiss with Adam and Gaskell pointed out that a mutual attraction has grown between the pair. Gaskell later revealed in an interview with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Kirsty would not begin a relationship with Adam as she is \\"not ready\\" for a relationship following the end of her marriage to Warren. The pair fall out in July 2011 after Adam questions Kirsty's abilities to work. However, Kirsty and Adam reconcile before she departs and Kirsty warns Adam that he needs to change his attitude, which he decides he will do. Gaskell noted that the characters did not get the opportunity to pair romantically, but opined that if they did, they would have made \\"a great couple\\". Kirsty's bold personality results in her often clashing with other members of the ED staff. She clashes with senior nurse Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer). Gaskell pointed out that their \\"different nursing styles\\" led to them sharing conflicting views. On one occasion, Tess warns Kirsty after over-involving herself with a patient. Gaskell explained this \\"frustrates\\" her character as she \\"passionately believes in going that extra mile for a patient if it means it will help them outside of the ED.\\" Kirsty later clashes with Tess again over patient care, but they reconcile when Kirsty requires Tess' help after injuring herself. Similarly, Kirsty clashes with ED doctor Ruth Winters and they share some \\"fairly fractious\\" scenes although Gaskell and Taylor knew each other from school and enjoyed filming together. Gaskell was pleased to work with Taylor again as it \\"feels like the most natural thing in the world.\\" When Shona Wark (Evelyn Hoskins) is assigned to work on reception but vanishes from her post, Kirsty challenges her and later finds her car has been vandalised by Shona.  Home life and domestic abuse  In June 2010, Kent revealed that Kirsty's home life would be explored. Lord's casting in the role of Kirsty's husband, Warren, was announced shortly afterwards; the character was billed as \\"dark and brooding\\". On Lord's casting, Kent commented, \\"We're going to see some really powerful stuff from him and Lucy Gaskell\\". Lord enjoyed working with Gaskell and hoped to work with her again in the future. Warren is a former firefighter who can no longer work due to a medical condition, which makes him frustrated. Having married Kirsty at a young age, he struggled to cope with their marriage and having a child. Lord explained that Warren \\"genuinely loves\\" Nita and desires a relationship with Kirsty, but is \\"fighting a losing battle with himself and others\\". He also pointed out that Warren has \\"an explosive temper\\" and can be \\"extremely manipulative\\", stemming from how little pride he has. Gaskell mentioned that Warren would be introduced in the show's twenty-fifth series, and he made his first appearance in the episode \\"Reasons Unknown\\", broadcast on 16 October 2010. During Warren's first appearance, Kirsty's home life is portrayed as \\"miserable\\" due to her unstable relationship with Warren, and Helen Childs of Inside Soap realised that to Kirsty, the ED is \\"a refuge\\" from her home life. Gaskell pointed out that Kirsty enjoys her job because she has an unpleasant home life. Producers used a \\"slow-burn\\" approach for the storytelling of Kirsty's domestic abuse plot, which Gaskell liked. She enjoyed the hidden hints in the build-up to the storyline and preferred this approach rather than \\"wrapping it up in a few weeks\\". Gaskell pointed out that there was \\"quite a big mystery\\" with Kirsty following her arrival, which added to the slow-burn approach. The actress found the storyline emotionally challenging and admitted that she struggled to \\"detach herself\\" from the role after work. She found the storyline \\"tiring\\" and said she and Lord became \\"emotional\\" about the story as they wanted to portray it correctly. Gaskell and producers worked together to display that domestic abuse often occurs with \\"strong and feisty women\\", which she initially found surprising. Gaskell wanted to portray all elements of the domestic abuse rather than focusing on the violence. She commented, \\"We were keen to show the steady build up, the subtle emotional abuse that‚Äôs sometimes harder to identify, and also show the aftereffects of abuse.\\" The actress praised show producers and researchers for their handling of the storyline. Gaskell prepared for the storyline by researching the role and contacting domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid. She visited the charity's call centre in Bristol and discovered the help they offer to victims of abuse. The actress also visited a refuge in London, where she spoke to various women who informed Gaskell of their stories. Gaskell called the women \\"inspiring\\" and is \\"incredibly grateful\\" towards them for their support. The actress wanted Kirsty's storyline to raise awareness for domestic violence as she felt it was an issue not publicised enough. She commented, \\"If this storyline has helped even one person, then we've done our job.\\" Struggling to sleep at home, Kirsty takes diazepam before receiving a call from work informing her she is late. She rushes to get into work, which is challenging for Kirsty. Struggling to stay awake, Kirsty \\"tricks\\" Adam into prescribing her Ritalin although it has a negative effect on her body and she collapses. She is discovered by nurse Madiha Dhurani (Hasina Haque) and Adam, who Gaskell described as Kirsty's \\"knight in shining scrubs\\". Adam saves Kirsty, but hides her until she regains consciousness. When she awakens, Adam tries to talk to Kirsty, but she is hesitant to speak to him. Gaskell explained that while Kirsty is not yet prepared to speak to Adam, she will \\"start to crack\\". Warren and Nita are later involved in a car crash, but when medics arrive at the scene, they cannot find Nita, although Adam eventually finds her. Kirsty is \\"really shocked and annoyed\\" with Warren for driving as he struggles to walk. Gaskell admitted that Kirsty feels \\"uncomfortable\\" and \\"awkward\\" in both Warren and Adam's company following a kiss she shared with Adam. Warren begins to \\"manipulate\\" his living situation and suggests he has myalgic encephalomyelitis. Gaskell said that Kirsty is \\"sceptical\\" about the suggestion as she is worried that he is governing her using \\"mind games\\". On why Kirsty stays with Warren, Gaskell explained that there were many reasons, which the audience would soon discover. When Kirsty discovers Warren may have muscular dystrophy, she begins to lose concentration at work. Struggling, Kirsty shares a \\"tender moment\\" with Adam, and at home, Warren realises Adam has texted Kirsty so attacks her. A bruised Kirsty later arrives in the ED, worrying Adam, who questions how she received the bruises. Kirsty claims they appeared after playing with Nita, but she has an X-ray so she can discover the extent of her bruising. Adam reviews the results and discovers several injuries. Kirsty then admits that she is being abused by Warren, who attacks Kirsty when they return home. When Warren attacks Kirsty again, she is left bloodied and flees to Adam's house. Kirsty decides to leave Warren in the wake of her attack, accepting she is a \\"victim\\" and admitting to Nita that she is frightened of Warren. Gaskell stated that this is \\"a real wake-up call\\" for Kirsty, who briefly considers staying with Adam until she realises Warren would look for her there, endangering her and Nita. Kirsty decides to leave Holby and Gaskell stated that Kirsty believes Warren would \\"kill her\\" if he found her. Adam realises that Kirsty is leaving, which she confirms, before leaving Adam a \\"hurriedly written\\" note and returning home. As she packs her belongings, Warren returns and confronts Kirsty. Gaskell explained that when Warren finds Kirsty, he becomes \\"scared\\" that he may lose control so grows \\"increasingly violent\\", which the actress said is \\"the most dangerous time\\" for Kirsty. Kirsty and Warren argue and when Adam arrives at the house, he discovers an unconscious Warren at the bottom of the staircase. Following his fall, Warren is left comatose while Kirsty remains at his bedside, hoping he will die. Gaskell explained that Kirsty is \\"terrified\\" that Warren will murder her if he regains consciousness. When Warren's mother, Cathy (Mary Jo Randle), arrives at the hospital, Kirsty reveals that Warren is abusing her and is horrified when Cathy is unsurprised, causing them to argue. When Warren awakes from the coma, Kirsty becomes worried and alerts Adam, which Cathy tells Warren. He becomes enraged and confronts Adam, warning him to stay away from Kirsty. Warren becomes exhausted and punches Kirsty, appalling Kirsty who leaves with Nita. However, after Kirsty leaves, Warren is admitted to resus with deep vein thrombosis. In resus, Warren dies. Following Warren's death, Adam comforts Kirsty who later has an argument with Nita, before discovering her daughter has run away. Kirsty struggles following Nita's disappearances and when a teenage girl is admitted to the ED and later dies, Kirsty \\"fears the worst\\". The girl is confirmed not to be Nita and she is later admitted to the ED, much to Kirsty's relief. When Adam questions Nita, the teenager reveals she caused her father's death. Kirsty discovers Nita's secret in late April 2011 after attending a ceremony honouring Warren. Having heard Warren's former colleague describe him as \\"wonderful and courageous\\", Nita becomes \\"confused\\" and absconds. When Kirsty finds her, they begin to reminisce about Warren and discuss the impact he had on their lives. After they comfort each other, Nita confesses that she pushed Warren down the stairs. Producers used flashbacks to reveal that Warren's attack on Kirsty caused her to lose consciousness and while she was unconscious, Nita pushed Warren, causing him to fall down the stairs. Gaskell explained that Kirsty presumed that Warren had fallen as she \\"never\\" considered that Nita could be responsible. On Kirsty's feelings towards Nita's attack, Gaskell commented, \\"She's not angry ‚Äî just guilty that Nita resorted to this. Kirsty blames herself.\\" Nita's confession was filmed in late December 2010 on a swaying tower situated 50 feet above ground while weather conditions were bad. Gaskell found the experience \\"scary\\" and noted that the show's continuity team struggled because it occasionally snowed while filming the scenes.  Departure  Gaskell decided to quit her role after a year of filming with the show. After informing producers of her decision, the actress discovered she was pregnant, which she described as \\"fantastic timing\\". Gaskell confirmed that producers had left the door open for a potential return and said that she is \\"really sad\\" to leave the serial. The actress spoke with producers \\"a lot\\" about the character's exit, and decided to produce a \\"happy ending\\" for the character. Gaskell found filming her final scenes \\"emotional\\" and became hysterical when her colleagues began to bid her goodbye. She also said that she missed her co- stars after leaving, but stated she remains in contact with them. In July 2011, Adam and Kirsty begin to treat a patient, Emily (Kirsty Armstrong), who has been raped. When Kirsty suggests that Emily should be assessed by the psychiatric team, Adam questions if she is allowing her own abuse judge her professional opinion. Furious, Kirsty reminds him that she did not enjoy her abuse, which is overheard by her colleagues, leaving Kirsty \\"horrified\\". Gaskell explained that Kirsty is \\"mortified\\", but when Tess comforts her, she realises she needs to accept her history and deal with it. The events of the episode began the process of Kirsty's departure. Kirsty departs in the series 25 episode \\"When You're Smiling\\", broadcast on 30 July 2011. In the build-up to her departure, Kirsty has avoided discussing her feelings about Warren's death. Gaskell explained that Kirsty believes her abuse disappeared when Warren died, which is not correct. Kirsty treats a terminally ill patient with a \\"very positive outlook on life\\". The patient motivates Kirsty to be positive and create happier memories for her and Nita so Kirsty resigns from her job during her shift, before walking out of the ED. When Adam questions where she is going, Kirsty tells him she does not know and laughs. Gaskell called the moment \\"the most liberating moment of her adult life\\" and she said it was \\"a lovely moment to play\\". Kirsty ultimately decides to leave Holby, which Gaskell described as a place \\"full of bad memories\\". Producers wanted Kirsty to leave happily, which Gaskell liked as she felt Kirsty had experienced a lot of \\"misery\\". == Reception == Louise Naughton of Nursing in Practice called Kirsty \\"forceful and feisty\\" as well as \\"capable and talented\\", but stated that she became \\"belittled, controlled and bruised\\" in her domestic abuse storyline. Sue Haasler of Pauseliveaction branded the character \\"Maverick Nurse Kirsty\\" in her episode reviews. Helen Childs of Inside Soap noted that Kirsty is \\"in her element\\" working in the ED. What's on TV observed that Kirsty had \\"a rough ride\\" in her time in the ED. Collins (TV Choice) called the domestic abuse storyline \\"very powerful\\" and described Kirsty's departure as \\"uplifting\\" and a \\"happy ending\\" for the character. Naughton believed that Casualty successfully presented how \\"strong, independent and successful women\\" can be at risk of domestic abuse, similarly to other women. She also opined that Kirsty had \\"left a lasting impression\\" on viewers of the show. During the domestic abuse storyline, Gaskell received letters from viewers who related to Kirsty's situation. The actress found the letters \\"emotional\\" to read. She confirmed that some letters were from viewers who currently in an abusive relationship, which she found \\"frustrating\\" because she was unable to respond to those letters in case the abuser read Gaskell's response. In the letters she received, viewers praised the portrayal of the storyline, which left a positive impact on Gaskell. == References  External links == * Kirsty Clements on BBC Online * Kirsty Clements on IMDb Category:Casualty (TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Kirsty Clements"},{"id":"54261714","text":"Jos√© Julio Barillas (born 7 January 1932) is a Guatemalan sprinter.

In 1884, she was the first Oxford female student to be entered for the honour school of Mathematics. Seward then changed her focus to Chemistry, and in 1885 became the pioneer woman to obtain the first class honour school of Natural Science. ==Career== Upon graduation, Seward was immediately appointed Natural Science tutor at Somerville, in addition to undertaking research with the Oxford chemist, W.H. Pendlebury. Two publications on chemical reactions resulted from her work, one of which was read to the Royal Society. These were a study on the reaction kinetics between hydrogen chloride and potassium chlorate and a study of this reaction in the presence of iodide ions. Seward was appointed as lecturer in Chemistry at Royal Holloway College in 1887, where she taught Martha Whiteley. She resigned in 1891 to travel to Singapore to marry John McKillop, an engineer. When she returned to Britain in 1893, she taught at several institutions including the Girl's Grammar School, Bradford and Rodean School. In 1895 she was appointed to King's College, Women's Department in 1896 to teach chemistry in the new chemical laboratory. She was described there as \\"one of the foremost women science-lecturers\\", but in 1912, King's College decided to appoint a male lecturer, and McKillop was reassigned to library work. McKillop's position was terminated in 1914, and during World War I, Seward (by then known by her married name Margaret McKillop) worked in the Ministry of Food and wrote the book Food Values, What They Are and How to Calculate Them. She was awarded an M.B.E. in 1919 for her wartime studies on nutrition. ==Political activity== Margaret Seward McKillop joined the Fabian Society in 1894 and was a leading figure in its Women's Group, serving as chair for several years. ==References== Category:British women chemists Category:British chemists Category:Academics of King's College London Category:Academics of Royal Holloway, University of London Category:Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford Category:1864 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Members of the Fabian Society Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Scientists from Liverpool ","title":"Margaret Seward"},{"id":"54261745","text":"Uwe Eric Laufenberg (born 11 December 1960) is a German actor, stage director for play and opera, and theatre manager who has directed at international opera houses and festivals, such as Elektra at the Vienna State Opera and Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival.

Its genetic descent cannot be known for certain, but it is believed to be related to the now-extinct Copper sheep, Roux du Bagnes, and Pilot sheep breeds. The Roux du Valais is bred for both wool and meat. Its meat is of a good quality, and is very lean. Today, its wool is mainly used in specialty product, heavy-duty cloth. This is a fairly limited market due to the Roux du Valais's low population numbers. Historically, its wool was very popular in Switzerland for use in underwear and stockings, as it was believed to have therapeutic qualities including the ability to cure rheumatism. ==Characteristics== The Roux du Valais is a medium-sized sheep, with males weighing about 65‚Äì85 kg and ewes 50‚Äì65 kg. It is a distinctive red-brown color, but there is also an extremely rare black variety known as the Lotschental. Both sexes are horned. The Roux du Valais mainly lives in the French-speaking areas of Switzerland, but has expanded into other areas in recent years. It is one of the few surviving breeds indigenous to Switzerland. ==Conservation Status== The Roux du Valais is endangered, largely due to lack of interest in the breed in favor of faster growing breeds. It nearly became extinct in the 1980s, but a breeders association formed in 1994, The Swiss Breeding Association for Valais Rural Sheep, along with Pro Specie Rara, has helped improve the breed's genetics and seen its numbers rebound somewhat. The expansion of the breed into Romandie and German-speaking Switzerland has also helped its population increase. Still, there are estimated to be only about 1,000 Roux du Valais sheep left in the world. ==SourcesExternal links== *Roux du Valais breeders association (In French/ German) *Specie Pro Rara breed page (In French/ German/ Italian) Category:Sheep breeds originating in Switzerland ","title":"Roux du Valais"},{"id":"54261770","text":"Youssef Ali Omar (born 3 March 1928) is an Egyptian sprinter.

It served as the type genus for the family Ulidiidae, which was called Ortalidae at the time. In 1932, it was pointed out by Adlrich that the name Ortalis was preoccupied by a genus of birds (in family Cracidae) which had been named by Merrem in 1786. The name of the fly family was therefore revised, with some authors calling it Otitidae until Ulidiidae was settled on as standard. The genus itself was found to be paraphyletic, and all of its species have been reassigned to other genera, some in the Ulidiidae, and some in other Tephritoid families. In the following list, the species are organized according to the families and genera to which they have been reassigned. ==Family Ulidiidae== Ceroxys * Ortalis cinifera (Loew, 1846) ‚Üí Ceroxys cinifera * Ortalis confusa (Becker, 1912) ‚Üí Ceroxys confusa * Ortalis fraudulosa (Loew, 1864) ‚Üí Ceroxys fraudulosa * Ortalis laticornis ‚Üí Ceroxys laticornis Chaetopsis * Ortalis aenea (Wiedemann, 1830) ‚Üí Chaetopsis aenea ** Ortalis trifasciata (Wiedemann, 1830) ‚Üí Chaetopsis aenea * Ortalis massyla (Walker, 1849) ‚Üí Chaetopsis massyla Eumecosomyia * Ortalis nubila (Wiedemann, 1830) ‚Üí Eumecosomyia nubila Euxesta * Ortalis basalis (Walker, 1852) ‚Üí Euxesta basalis * Ortalis leucomelas (Walker, 1860) ‚Üí Euxesta leucomelas * Ortalis notata (Wiedemann, 1830) ‚Üí Euxesta notata * Ortalis platystoma (Thomson, 1869) ‚Üí Euxesta spoliata * Ortalis sororcula Wiedemann, 1830 ‚Üí Euxesta sororcula Herina * Ortalis lacustris (Meigen, 1826) ‚Üí Herina lacustris * Ortalis lugubris (Meigen, 1826) ‚Üí Herina lugubris * Ortalis palustris (Meigen, 1826) ‚Üí Herina palustris * Ortalis parva (Loew, 1864) ‚Üí Herina parva * Ortalis tristis (Meigen, 1826) ‚Üí Herina tristis ** Ortalis bifasciata Loew, 1858 ‚Üí Herina tristis ** Ortalis gyrans Loew, 1864 ‚Üí Herina tristis Hypochra * Ortalis albipennis (Loew, 1846) ‚Üí Hypochra albipennis Idana * Ortalis marginata (Say, 1830) ‚Üí Idana marginata Melieria * Ortalis acuticornis (Loew, 1854) ‚Üí Melieria acuticornis * Ortalis cana (Loew, 1858) ‚Üí Melieria cana * Ortalis omissa (Meigen, 1826) ‚Üí Melieria omissa * Ortalis unicolor (Loew, 1854) ‚Üí Melieria unicolor Otites * Ortalis angustata (Loew, 1859) ‚Üí Otites angustata * Ortalis bimaculata (Hendel, 1911) ‚Üí Otites bimaculata * Ortalis dominula (Loew, 1868) ‚Üí Otites dominula * Ortalis erythrocephala (Hendel, 1911) ‚Üí Otites erythrocephala * Ortalis grata (Loew, 1856) ‚Üí Otites grata * Ortalis nebulosa (Meigen, 1830) ‚Üí Otites nebulosa * Ortalis snowi (Cresson, 1924) ‚Üí Otites snowi * Ortalis stigma (Hendel, 1911) ‚Üí Otites stigma Pseudotephritis * Ortalis vau (Say, 1829) ‚Üí Pseudotephritis vauhttps://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/16027/1/USNMP-79_2900_1931.pdf Pterotaenia * Ortalis fasciata (Wiedemann, 1830) ‚Üí Pterotaenia fasciatahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/250034174_New_record_of_Pterotaenia_fasciata_Wiedemann_Diptera_Ulidiidae_in_Brazil_a_probably_mechanical_vector_of_enteric_bacteria Seioptera * Ortalis costalis (Walker, 1849) ‚Üí Seioptera costalis ==Family Platystomatidae== Atopognathus * Ortalis complens (Walker, 1859) ‚Üí Atopognathus complens * Ortalis leucomerus ‚Üí Atopognathus leucomerus * Ortalis tarsalis ‚Üí Atopognathus tarsalis Cleitamia * Ortalis astrolabei (Boisduval, 1835) ‚Üí Cleitamia astrolabei Engistoneura * Ortalis paralleia ‚Üí Engistoneura paralleia Euxestomoea * Ortalis prompta (Walker, 1859) ‚Üí Euxestomoea promptahttps://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/bdc684f8-b413-44ae-9d68-c7279c2fe284 Neoardelio * Ortalis alternatus ‚Üí Neoardelio alternatus Poecilotraphera * Ortalis comperei (Coquillett) ‚Üí Poecilotraphera comperei Pseudepicausta * Ortalis bigotii (Macquart, 1851) ‚Üí Pseudepicausta bigotii Rhytidortalis * Ortalis conformis (Walker, 1853) ‚Üí Rhytidortalis conformis (or incertae sedis) Rivellia * Ortalis aequifera (Walker, 1862) ‚Üí Rivellia aequiferahttp://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/fiji/pdf/lower1970.pdf * Ortalis bipars (Walker, 1861) ‚Üí Rivellia bipars * Ortalis concisivitta (Walker, 1862) ‚Üí Rivellia concisivitta * Ortalis decatomoides (Walker, 1862) ‚Üí Rivellia decatomoides * Ortalis isara ‚Üí Rivellia isara * Ortalis ligata (Say, 1830) ‚Üí Rivellia ligata * Ortalis mentissa (Walker, 1849) ‚Üí Rivellia mentissahttps://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/1c70296f-f32a-48f1-8056-0135b6aa8e60 * Ortalis obliqua (Walker, 1861) ‚Üí Rivellia obliquahttps://archive.org/stream/RecordsSouthAus16Sout/RecordsSouthAus16Sout_djvu.txt * Ortalis vacillans (Walker, 1860) ‚Üí Rivellia vacillans Traphera * Ortalis chalybea ‚Üí Traphera chalybea Zygaenula * Ortalis dispila (Thomson, 1869) ‚Üí Zygaenula dispila (or incertae sedis) ==Family Richardiidae== Automola * Ortalis atomaria ‚Üí Automola atomariahttps://www.gbif.org/species/5086382 ==Family Tephritidae== Pseudoedaspis * Ortalis decorata (Blanchard, 1852) ‚Üí Pseudoedaspis decoratahttps://www.gbif.org/species/5086900 * Ortalis striolata (Blanchard, 1852) ‚Üí Pseudoedaspis striolatahttps://www.gbif.org/species/5086901 ==Uncertain== * Ortalis fenestrata ‚Üí ??? * Ortalis flavoscutellata ‚Üí ??? * Ortalis longicornis ‚Üí ??? * Ortalis picta ‚Üí ??? * Ortalis quinquemaculata ‚Üí ??? * Ortalis semivitta ‚Üí ??? ==References== Category:Ulidiidae ","title":"Ortalis (fly)"},{"id":"54261835","text":"Leinefelde station is a major railway junction in the German state of Thuringia and is the most important station in Eichsfeld. It is located in the town of Leinefelde in the Thuringian municipality of Leinefelde-Worbis in the Eichsfeld district. The Halle‚ÄìKassel and Gotha‚ÄìLeinefelde railways meet there and in the past the now closed Leinefelde‚ÄìWulften and Leinefelde‚ÄìTreysa railways also connected with the station. The latter route was part of the Kanonenbahn (Cannons Railway) between Berlin and Metz. == History== With the construction of the gro√üen Rheinstra√üe (Great Rhine Road), the current federal highway 80, between Cologne and Berlin in 1826 and the Reichsstra√üe (National Road), the current federal highway 247, from M√ºhlhausen to Duderstadt in 1834, Leinefelde began to develop into a road hub. With the construction of the Halle‚ÄìNordhausen‚ÄìLeinefelde‚ÄìEichenberg‚ÄìKassel/G√∂ttingen railway in 1867, Leinefelde was also connected by rail. The Nordhausen‚ÄìEichenberg section of the line was officially opened on 9 July 1867. When a few years later the Gotha‚ÄìLeinefelde railway was opened, the station became a railway junction and it was redesignated as the Zentralbahnhof des Eichsfeldes (Central station of Eichsfeld). The Kanonenbahn between Berlin and Metz, which runs through Leinefelde, was completed by the opening of the rail connection from Leinefelde to Eschwege in 1880. From 1897, Leinefelde was also the starting point of the Leinefelde‚ÄìWulften railway, connecting Leinefelde via Breitenbach, Worbis and Wintzingerode and Duderstadt with the South Harz Railway (S√ºdharzstrecke). The line was interrupted between Teistungen and Duderstadt from 1945 by the establishment of the inner German border. Operations on the line were gradually reduced until traffic ended on the last part of the line in 2001 and it finally dismantled by 2005. The Kanonenbahn was also interrupted by the establishment of the inner German border between Schwebda (Hesse) and Geismar (Thuringia), which greatly reduced the importance of the Hessian section of the line. Passenger services were gradually reduced until they were discontinued in 1994 and a little later this part of the line was closed. A second track was added to the Halle‚ÄìHann. M√ºnden railway and it was electrified up to 1994 as part of German Unity Transport Project No. 6 (Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit Nr. 6). An electronic interlocking was established in Leinefelde station as one of the first in Thuringia, controlling the Heilbad Heiligenstadt‚ÄìGernrode and Leinefelde‚ÄìBad Langensalza sections. == Platforms== The platform are fully accessible by lifts. {  !

She was one of the leading pioneers of dietetics. == Early life == Andross was born on 15 March 1893 in Irvine, Scotland. Her father, Henry Andross, was a cashier. He built a home for his family on Bank Street in 1901, where Mary lived for most of her life. Andross was an athletic child, but a car accident during her early years meant she lost much of the use of her legs. However, she continued to live an active life and enjoyed fishing on Harris. == Academic career == Andross enrolled in the University of Glasgow in 1912. She studied various scientific subjects, including anatomy, organic chemistry, zoology, natural philosophy and physiology. She graduated in 1916 with a BSc in Science and Engineering. After graduation she undertook some postgraduate work at the Technical College and then at the University of Glasgow. She taught at Irvine Royal Academy between 1916 and 1917, then worked at the Ministry of Munitions Inspections Department on poison gases from 1917 to 1919. Afterwards, she returned to the University of Glasgow to work as a Chemistry Assistant until 1923. She eventually became the Head of the Science Department of the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science, where she remained for 40 years until she retired in 1965. Andross became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry in 1951, of the Institute of Food Science and Technology in 1964, and was a member of the Nutrition Society and the Society of Chemical Industry. == World War II efforts == During World War II, Andross made three major contributions to the field of dietetics: # Carried out research on the sources of vitamin C, in particular rose hips. In order to encourage increased vitamin C intake among the general public, Andross developed recipes that could easily be prepared at home. # Helped to organise a canteen for servicemen in St Enoch Station. # Promoted the idea of preserving fruits and vegetables and helped to establish a service providing preserved foods to the general public. Andross herself canned, bottled and pickled foods, while also leading a team of staff who used their holiday time to deliver services in rural areas. == Death == Andross died on 22 February 1968. == References == Category:1893 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Dietetics Category:Scottish women scientists Category:20th-century Scottish scientists Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:20th-century Scottish women ","title":"Mary Andross"},{"id":"54261885","text":"Alan William Lillington (born 4 September 1932) is a British sprinter. ==Athletics career== He competed in the men's 100 metres at the 1952 Summer Olympics.

During is creation, this album was focused on the US midwest because in the past, many Norwegians left Europe to move to America and many of them in the midwest. ==Reception== Thom Jurek in his review for AllMusic says that \\"The compositions are all lyrical, in typical Eick fashion, but with [Gjermund] Larsen they take on a rougher, more earthen quality.\\" and that \\"it perfectly illustrates the thematic frame of the journey he set out to portray: that of the immigrant encountering the unknown and embracing it\\" In his review for The Guardian, Dave Gely gave this album four stars and says that \\"Eick has a beautiful tone and writes attractive themes, by turns haunting and energetic.\\" and added that \\"The inclusion of folk violinist Gjermund Larsen in the band adds a contrasting texture and some truly exciting solos.\\" Karl Ackermann gave a four and a half stars and says in All About Jazz that \\"Eick favors minimalist constructs and otherworldly atmospherics, qualities that are well suited in imagining the theme and mood he has intended for Midwest, a warm album as natural and comforting as going home.\\" ==Track listing== ECM Records ‚Äì ECM 2410. ==Personnel== *Mathias Eick ‚Äì trumpet *Gjermund Larsen ‚Äì violin *Jon Balke ‚Äì piano *Mats Eilertsen ‚Äì double bass *Helge Norbakken ‚Äì percussion ==References== Category:ECM Records albums Category:2015 albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher ","title":"Midwest (Mathias Eick album)"},{"id":"54262094","text":"The canton of Murat is an administrative division of the Cantal department, southern France.

They are secretive and not much is known about the members of the group. The group's skill means that its attacks sometimes go without detection for many years. The group, considered an advanced persistent threat, has been active since at least 2009, targeting victims via spear-phishing attacks against government officials' private email addresses, zero-day exploits, and hot- patching vulnerabilities. Upon gaining access to their victims' computers, the group steals economically sensitive information. PLATINUM succeeded in keeping a low profile until their abuse of the Microsoft Windows hot patching system was detected and publicly reported in April 2016. This hot patching method allows them to use Microsoft's own features to quickly patch, alter files or update an application, without rebooting the system altogether, this way, they can maintain the data they have stolen while masking their identity. In June 2017, PLATINUM became notable for exploiting the serial over LAN (SOL) capabilities of Intel's Active Management Technology to perform data exfiltration. ==PLATINUM's techniques== Once in control of a target's computer, PLATINUM actors can move through the target's network using specially built malware modules. These have either been written by one of the multiple teams working under the Platinum group umbrella, or they could have been sold through any number of outside sources that Platinum has been dealing with since 2009. Because of the diversity of this malware, the versions of which have little code in common, Microsoft's investigators have taxonomised it into families. The piece of malware most widely used by PLATINUM was nicknamed Dispind by Microsoft. This piece of malware can install a keylogger, a piece of software that records (and may also be able to inject) keystrokes. PLATINUM also uses other malware like \\"JPIN\\" which installs itself into the %appdata% folder of a computer so that it can obtain information, load a keylogger, download files and updates, and perform other tasks like extracting files that could contain sensitive information. \\"Adbupd\\" is another malware program utilised by PLATINUM, and is similar to the two previously mentioned. It is known for its ability to support plugins, so it can be specialised, making it versatile enough to adapt to various protection mechanisms. On November 9, 2019, Platinum APT's new Titanium backdoor was reported to mimic well-known computer system software in order to remain concealed. Intel Exploit In 2017, Microsoft reported that PLATINUM had begun to exploit a feature of Intel CPUs.\\"Platinum hacker group uses Intel AMT\\", Tad Group, 2017-09-25 The feature in question is Intel's AMT Serial-over-LAN (SOL), which allows a user to remotely control another computer, bypassing the host operating system of the target, including firewalls and monitoring tools within the host operating system. ==Security== Microsoft advises users to apply all of their security updates to minimize vulnerabilities and to keep highly sensitive data out of large networks. Because PLATINUM targets organizations, companies and government branches to acquire trade secrets, anyone working in or with such organizations can be a target for the group. ==See also== * Intel AMT#Known vulnerabilities and exploits * Titanium (malware) ==References== Category:2017 in computing Category:Cybercrime Category:Hacking in the 2010s ","title":"PLATINUM (cybercrime group)"},{"id":"54262109","text":"The Asian Rowing Championship is a rowing championship organised by the Asian Rowing Federation for competitors from the Asian countries. ==List tournaments== {  center;\\" - cccccc;\\" !width=30 # !width=50 Year !width=220Venue !width=200Date -  1  1985  align=left Sha Tin, Hong Kong  align=left -  2  1987  align=left Shanghai, China  align=left -  3  1989  align=left Chandigarh, India  align=left -  4  1991  align=left Tokyo, Japan  align=left -  5  1993  align=left South Korea  align=left -  6  1995  align=left China  align=left -  7  1997  align=left Taiwan  align=left -  8  1999  align=left Naganuma, Japan  align=left October 14‚Äì16, 1999 -  9  2001  align=left Xi'an, China  align=left September 23‚Äì27, 2001 -  10  2003  align=left China  align=left -  11  2005  align=left Hyderabad, India  align=left October 20‚Äì23, 2005 -  12  2007  align=left Chungju, South Korea  align=left October 16‚Äì19, 2007 -  13  2009  align=left Yilan, Taiwan  align=left November 4‚Äì8, 2009 -  14  2011  align=left Hwacheon, South Korea  align=left October 13‚Äì17, 2011 -  15  2013  align=left Lu'an, China  align=left September 25‚Äì29, 2013 -  16  2015  align=left Beijing, China  align=left September 24‚Äì28, 2015 -  17  2016  align=left Jiashan, China  align=left September 9‚Äì13, 2016 -  18  2017  align=left Pattaya, Thailand  align=left September 4‚Äì8, 2017 -  19  2019  align=left Chungju, South Korea  align=left October 23‚Äì27, 2019 } ==External links== *Official ARF site Asian Rowing Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Hong Kong ","title":"Asian Rowing Championships"},{"id":"54262118","text":"The glassy flying squid or glass squid (Hyaloteuthis pelagica) is the only species of the genus Hyaloteuthis of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, family Ommastrephidae.

The class is built for Greater Anglia for use on their inter-city services and the Stansted Express services. They first entered service on 8 January 2020, after being constructed between 2018 and 2020 in Switzerland. ==History== In August 2016, Abellio Greater Anglia was awarded the East Anglia franchise with a commitment to replace all of the existing fleet. As part of this, an order was placed with Stadler Rail for twenty 12-carriage electric multiple units that would join the FLIRT family. These new trains are classified as Class 745s and are divided into two sub-classes: ten 745/0 units and ten 745/1 units. Alongside the related Class 755 units, also in the FLIRT family, the units will be maintained at Crown Point TMD. The 745/0 units have now replaced the Class 90 locomotive, Mark 3 carriage and Driving Van Trailer loco-hauled sets on the inter-city London Liverpool Street to Norwich services. The interiors of the units feature USB and plug points, air conditioning, free WiFi, passenger information screens, larger accessible areas, bicycle storage areas and include digital seat reservation displays. In comparison to the 745/1 units, the 745/0 units include First Class accommodation, a bistro and a lower floor making the train more accessible for wheelchairs and pushchairs. A trolley service also operates on certain trains. == Operation == Greater Anglia Class 90 with its successor the Class 745 at Liverpool Street The trains were first approved for passenger service in July 2019 and were expected to enter passenger service in late 2019. However, there was a delay in this as they were still missing their passenger information systems around the time they were due to enter service, which resulted in Greater Anglia having to seek derogation to operate the Class 90 + Mark 3 sets into 2020. Following this, the first 745/0 unit finally entered service on 8 January 2020 on the Norwich to Liverpool Street route and, as of late March 2020, have now fully replaced the loco-hauled fleet. The first Class 745/1 unit entered service on 30 March 2020 and these are also being used on the Norwich to Liverpool Street route, with the first service on the Stansted Express starting on 28 July 2020. ==Fleet details== { !Class !Operator !No. Built !Year Built !Cars per Set !Unit nos. !Notes - 745/0 align=center rowspan=2Greater Anglia align=center10 align=center rowspan=22018-20 align=center rowspan=212 align=center745001-745010 Intercity - 745/1 align=center10 align=center745101-745110 Stansted Express } Greater Anglia Class 745/0 Greater Anglia Class 745/1 (Operated by Stansted Express) ==See also== * - A similar class of bi mode multiple units also being built by Stadler Rail for Greater Anglia. ==ReferencesExternal links== New Trains section of Greater Anglia Website Category:Stadler Rail multiple units Category:Train- related introductions in 2019 ","title":"British Rail Class 745"},{"id":"54262187","text":"Kelly England Prehn is a British model, editor, influencer, fashion ambassador, and businesswoman. == Early life and discovery == At 17 years old, England was discovered during a school trip in Covent Garden by a scout from Models 1 agency.Morgan, Sally. \\"Flying the Flag in Model Fashion: Kelly England on how Kate and the Beckhams are Winning Hearts in the East\\", Hello!

The museum in Bordeaux has many similar miniature portraits by anonymous painters, so it is possible there was a school there of some sort. Like many well-to-do young women painters of her time, she was not commercially active and her works were kept in the family. According to her \\"memorial\\" written by Samuel D. Burchard for the Proceedings of the Twenty- First Convocation of the University of the State of New York (held July 10, 11 and 12, 1883) on the request of her son, Daniel Strobel Martin, she lived in Liverpool next door to the Gladstone family and played with the older brother of the later prime minister William Ewart Gladstone.Proceedings of the Twenty- First Convocation of the University of the State of New York (held July 10, 11 and 12, 1883), edited by Weed, Parsons & Company, Printers, Albany, N.Y., 1884, page 241. During her time in France she learned French and became acquainted with French literature and the arts. After returning to the US, her father became deputy collector in the Custom House. In January 1831 he wrote a report with recommendations on the consular service of the United States that is seen as a valuable source that gives insight into the history of US foreign relations.The American Consul : a history of the United States Consular Service, 1776-1924, by Charles Stuart Kennedy, Washington , DC : New Academia Publishing, 2015 After her father died in 1839 Louisa married the ten-year- younger Benjamin Nicholas Martin who was a divinity student she met in New Haven, Connecticut. He became a clergyman and she travelled with him to Massachusetts and Albany, before settling in New York City where he became professor of philosophy at the University of the State of New York. It is believed that she stopped painting after marriage.Blog about Louisa Caroline Strobel in the collection of the Gibbes Museum of Art Her works are held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, donated by her grand-niece Ella Church Strobell, and the Gibbes Museum of Art (Carolina Art Association), donated by her son. The Metropolitan also has miniature portraits by John Vanderlyn of her parents. These were painted before Louisa was born and she would have been familiar with them all her life. They were possibly her initial inspiration to become an artist.

After the Nazi take-over in January 1933 she emigrated with her family, ending up living permanently in the Soviet Union. A series of disappointments followed and she became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet system which earlier, when she had written about the Soviet Union as a visitor from the west, she had eulogised. Her husband was identified as a Gestapo spy and executed in 1938. On 16 August 1939 Martha Ruben-Wolf was still unaware of what had happened to her husband following his arrest on 27 November 1937 when, despairing, she committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. == Life == Martha Ruben was born in L√∂hne, a small manufacturing town to the north of Paderborn. Moritz \\"Max\\" Ruben, her father, is described as a small businessman of Jewish provenance. Her upbringing was not a religious one, however. The family were relatively mobile, while the focus of Max's business changed several times as Martha was growing up. Her mother, born Regina Stern, was a teacher who was active in the women's movement (\\"b√ºrgerliche Frauenbewegung\\"), and who through these involvements came into contact with Helene St√∂cker and, presumably, with the powerful currents of the times involving pacifism, sexual reform and women's rights issues on which St√∂cker campaigned. In 1906 Martha started to study Mathematics and Natural sciences at Berlin University and the so-called \\"Technical Academy\\" in Charlottenburg, funding her studies through a combination of private tutoring, bursaries and journalism. In 1908 she switched to medicine which she studied till 1914, receiving her doctorate in medicine in 1915. She had studied subjects which were traditionally male preserves, but the labour shortages resulting from the slaughter of the First World War would open up opportunities after 1918 which most observers in 1914 would have regarded as still unrealistic. During the First World War she worked in a hospital. After 1918 she set herself up as a doctor in the Berlin quarter of Niedersch√∂neweide. Her feminism and her leftwing political commitment meant that the focus of her work was on working class women: sources describe her as a gynaecologist which, whether through training or practical experience, she became. This also involved a lot of work in the area of birth control, which then as throughout the twentieth century was frequently border-line controversial. In (or before) 1919 Martha Ruben joined the short-lived Independent Social Democratic Party (\\" Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) which had broken away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party in 1917 after three years of increasingly intense opposition within that party to the decision of the party leadership, implemented back in 1914, to operate what amounted to a parliamentary truce on the issue of parliamentary votes on funding for the war. After the USPD in turn broke apart, on 4 December 1920 she joined the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. Someone else who switched to the communist party around this time was Lothar Wolf (1882‚Äì1938), the son of a Jewish hotelier and another recently qualified doctor. Lothar Wolf and Martha Ruben married on 9 November 1922. They are described at this time as being among the best known communist personalities in Berlin. Through the 1920s Martha Ruben-Wolf pursued her work as a physician. Abortion was a controversial issue in Germany through the period and the laws on it changed frequently, but it remained illegal. As a qualified doctor who was nevertheless prepared to perform abortions, Ruben-Wolf's services were much in demand, and there is an estimate quoted by one source that by 1933 she had illegally performed around 3,000 abortions, in the face of constant opposition \\"from middle class physicians, police, local state prosecutors, provocateurs and blackmailers\\". She and her husband were also active in the party. She was a co-founder of the Rote Frauen und M√§dchenbund (\\"Red Women's and Girls' League\\" / RFMB) and in 1926 addressed the first national party congress. Her provocative article-manifesto \\"Abtreibung oder Verh√ºtung\\" (loosely: \\"Abortion or Prevention\\") appeared with a preface by Friedrich Wolf and was reprinted several times. According to one estimate, by 1931 more than 150,000 copies had been printed. She stood for election to the regional parliament (\\"Preu√üischer Landtag\\") in 1928 and to the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") in 1930 and again in March 1933, but without being elected. In 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1930, with her husband, she visited and toured the Soviet Union. They undertook these visits not at the direction from the party but at their own expense. During the 1920s and 1930s Lothar and Martha Wolf published a succession of travel reports, concentrating particularly on trips they made to the Soviet Union and Italy. From these it is clear that Martha Ruben-Wolf saw the Soviet Union as a beacon for the future, making favourable comparisons between the Soviet style \\"planned economy\\" and western experience of \\"the death of capitalism\\". It must be acknowledged that at the start of a decade that kicked off with the Great Depression, and before rumours began to seep through of the political purges that swept Moscow during the second half of the decade, these opinions were not so bizarre as, viewed through the prism of subsequent events, they later seemed. Martha Ruben-Wolf had been a member of the Union of German Doctors (\\"Hartmannbund\\") since 1911, and in 1931 she led what one source describes as the first ever delegation of physicians from Germany to the Soviet Union. She spoke out against ¬ß 218 of the German constitution- the \\"Abortion clause\\" which she dubbed the \\"Prison paragraphs\\" because of the threatened penalties they included for doctors and midwives. She contrasted what she characterised as the enlightened approach taken in the Soviet Union with the situation in Germany. During the later 1920s the abortion issue became highly charged politically in Germany, and Martha Ruben-Wolf's activism gained increasing coverage; but it also drew hostility. In 1929 copies of her pamphlet \\"Abtreibung oder Verh√ºtung\\" (loosely: \\"Abortion or Prevention\\") were confiscated on orders from the regional court in D√ºsseldorf. The Union of Socialist Doctors, which politically aligned itself closely with the Social Democratic Party excluded her in or shortly after 1929. High-profile campaigning on an increasingly contentious topic was making her an uncomfortable political ally in some quarters. As a result of her stance on abortion Martha Ruben-Wolf lived under constant threat of arrest by 1933. The scale of the personal risk changed after the Nazis took power at the start of that year and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The new regime enjoyed, at this stage, widespread support, based on a traditional populist cocktail of hatred and hope. The hatred was focused on two groups in particular: Communists and Jews. Lothar and Martha Ruben-Wolf belonged in both categories. Like many others similarly placed, they chose emigration in order to avoid arrest and worse. In February 1933 they crossed the border with their two children into Switzerland, settling briefly in Lugano where they stayed at a guest house. Back in Germany the doctors' surgery in Berlin was closed down. Their furniture and life insurance policies were confiscated by the state and their right to practice medicine cancelled through revocation of their membership of the local \\"√Ñrztekammer\\" (literally: \\"Chamber of Physicians\\"). Fellow political exiles in Lugano included Bertolt Brecht and Lion Feuchtwanger. However, despite the mountains, Nazi Germany still felt menacingly close. Feuchtwanger had already written a lengthy English language drama which was presented in the United States and United Kingdom, giving detailed accounts of Nazi persecution against Jews in Germany. The Nazis were incensed and he was receiving large amounts of threatening mail from Germany. All the friends moved on, further away from Germany: in October 1933 Lothar and Martha Ruben-Wolf moved to Paris while their two children, at this stage, stayed in Switzerland where they were placed in a children's home. Paris had become the informal capital in the west for exiled German communists and the Ruben-Wolfs made contact with various groups including physicians and authors. In the end they decided that as card carrying communists their prospects in France were uncertain and that they had a better chance of building a future in the other preferred destination of exiled German communists, Moscow. They sought permission to relocate to Moscow, which in effect on 29 December 1933 they received in a letter from Fritz Heckert, who by now was himself based in Moscow and acting as the Comintern presidium member representing the interests of German party members. It was, perhaps, prescient that they had already, in 1932, transferred 600 Marks to the \\"Weltoktober\\" housing co-operative in Moscow which would entitle them, it was said, to three rooms in one of the large Soviet style communal apartment buildings. Visas were received and the children were retrieved from Switzerland. On 11 February 1934 the family of four left Paris for the journey to Moscow, where they arrived on 27 February 1934. When they arrived in Moscow they were placed in a room in a Moscow hotel while their two children were placed in a children's home 300 kilometers away in Ivanovo. Martha visited the institution and wrote a strong letter of complaint about the unhygienic conditions and the failures of child care. This led to a commission of enquiry being set up but it also led to the children being threatened with expulsion from the home. Eventually a room for the children was found in the hotel where their parents had been placed. It was only in April 1936, following a court judgement, that their right to three rooms in the \\"Weltoktober\\" housing co- operative was acknowledged. Lothar Ruben-Wolf took a job with the All Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (WIEM) where he was set to work on fascist race theories. Martha Ruben-Wolf was employed as a gynaecologist in The Eighth Moscow Abortion clinic. She was disappointed to find that in the eyes of senior colleagues her German qualifications and experience counted for very little. There was plenty of work to be done, but she experienced the absence of professional status acutely. A particular disappointment came in June 1936 when the Soviet Union reverted to the more conservative stance on birth control already enforced in Germany, and abortion, a topic as politicised in the Soviet Union as in the west, again became illegal. As the political climate in Moscow turned increasingly ugly, Martha Ruben-Wolf experienced four months of unemployment, and then was given a relatively poorly paid job with Intourist, the state tourism agency. The leader was becoming increasingly paranoid. German political refugees who had come to Moscow in search of safety were increasingly in danger of being identified and denounced as Trotskyites or agents of the German government or both. Although it took a few months for the realities of the Stalinist purges to become apparent, Martha Ruben-Wolf was forced to become aware of the extent to which friends were disappearing, notably after her husband was arrested by the security services on 28 November 1937 or 15 January 1938. (Sources differ.) Accused of being a Gestapo spy, on 4 October 1938 he was sentenced to death and shot. It is not clear whether Martha ever learned of his fate. She certainly devoted desperate energy, apparently without success, to trying to find out what had happened to him after he disappeared. On 16 August 1939 or 16 July 1940 Martha Ruben-Wolf committed suicide. (Again, sources differ as to the date.) By this time she had been able to return to the medical profession, first as a nurse and then as a doctor. The cause of her death is given as an overdose of sleeping pills. Her children were deported to Karaganda in Kazakhstan in 1941. Sonja married Israel Friedmann, a Zionist from Lithuania, in 1942. In 1944 she gave birth to the couple's daughter and in 1948 they were permitted to move to Vilnius. Lithuania had been part of the Soviet Union since 1940, and it was only in 1958 that Sonja was permitted, with her family, to leave the Soviet Union. They were released to East Germany but were able to relocate to West Germany from where, still in 1958, they emigrated to Israel. Martha's younger child, Walter was conscripted into the Red Army and killed in action in 1943. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1939 deaths Category:People from Herford Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:20th-century German physicians Category:Women gynaecologists Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Rotfrontk√§mpferbund members Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany Category:Great Purge victims from Germany Category:German feminists Category:Socialist feminists Category:20th-century women physicians ","title":"Martha Ruben-Wolf"},{"id":"54262395","text":"Atalia is an Italian-language oratorio by Simon Mayr to a libretto by Felice Romani, premiered in Naples, 1822.Helen M.

This philosophy is systematized in the organization's motto: Open Political Unity for a New Majority (), which means the formation of a broad political field capable of consolidating itself as an alternative for the emancipation of the Brazilian people against a political regime built by the \\"Casa Grande\\" (\\"Big House\\", a reference to the slave owners and the dominat majority) and the \\"Casa Branca\\" (the White House, a reference to foreign imperialist influence in the country). == Identity == The identity of the organization is defined by its political activities, which are oriented towards the \\"militant, popular and of the masses.\\" The Popular Brigades seek a militancy of a territorial characteristic, organizing different social groups especially those that cannot sustain the needs of daily life.

It has successfully advanced key movements such as the ocupa√ß√µes, which the group initiated in the 2000s. This involved organized squats as a strategy for the poor to gain access to housing, which the organization stressed is a social right guaranteed by the Brazilian constitution. In June 2011, for instance, Brigadas Populares - together with other social movements - occupied a Social Services government building, which was leased to the Fasano hotel for the World Cup. The group demanded that the city needs more housing projects instead of hotels. They emerged victorious after a State Court ruled that the lease was null and void. In 2018, a Popular Brigades militant, Andr√©ia de Jesus, was elected as a State Deputy in Minas Gerais, with over 17 thousand votes, becoming the first ever black woman to be elect to the State House of Minas Gerais.

Developed by Xerox and Canon in the mid-1980s, its existence became public only in 2004. In 2018, scientists developed privacy software to anonymize prints in order to support whistleblowers publishing their work. ==History== In the mid-1980s Xerox pioneered an encoding mechanism for a unique number represented by tiny dots spread over the entire print area. Xerox developed the machine identification code \\"to assuage fears that their color copiers could be used to counterfeit bills\\" and received U.S. Patent No 5515451 describing the use of the yellow dots to identify the source of a copied or printed document. In October 2004, consumers first heard of the hidden feature, when it was used by Dutch authorities to track down counterfeiters who had used a Canon color laser printer. In November 2004, PC World reported the machine identification code had been used for decades in some printers, allowing law enforcement to identify and track down counterfeiters. The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) has denied that it developed the feature. The decoding process discovered by the EFF. In 2005, the civil rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) encouraged the public to send in sample printouts and subsequently decoded the pattern. The pattern has been demonstrated on a wide range of printers from different manufacturers and models. The EFF stated in 2015 that the documents that they previously received through the FOIA suggested that _all_ major manufacturers of color laser printers entered a secret agreement with governments to ensure that the output of those printers is forensically traceable. In 2007, the European Parliament was asked about the question of invasion of privacy. ==Technical aspects== Yellow dots produced by an HP Color LaserJet CP1515n The pattern consists of a dot-matrix spread of yellow dots, which can barely be seen with the naked eye. The dots have a diameter of a tenth of a millimeter (0.004\\") and a spacing of about one millimeter (0.039\\"). Their arrangement encodes the serial number of the device, date and time of the printing, and is repeated several times across the printing area in case of errors. For example, if the code consists of 8 √ó 16 dots in a square or hexagonal pattern, it spreads over a surface of about and appears on a sheet of size A4 paper about 150 times. Thus, it can be analyzed even if only fragments or excerpts are available. Some printers arrange yellow dots in seemingly random point clouds. According to the Chaos Computer Club in 2005, color printers leave the code in a matrix of 32 √ó 16 dots and thus can store 64 bytes of data (64√ó8). , Xerox was one of the few manufacturers to draw attention to the marked pages, stating in a product description, \\"The digital color printing system is equipped with an anti-counterfeit identification and banknote recognition system according to the requirements of numerous governments. Each copy shall be marked with a label which, if necessary, allows identification of the printing system with which it was created. This code is not visible under normal conditions.\\" In 2018, scientists at the TU Dresden analyzed the patterns of 106 printer models from 18 manufacturers and found four different encoding schemes. ==Visibility== Yellow Dots: tiny yellow dots on the print-out representing the hidden code of an HP Color LaserJet 3700. The Machine Identification Code can be made visible by printing or copying a page and subsequently scanning a small section with a high-resolution scanner. The yellow color channel can then be enhanced with an image processing program, to make any dots of the MIC clearly visible. Under good lighting conditions, a magnifying glass may be enough to see the pattern. Under UV-light the yellow dots are clearly recognizable. Machine Identification Code (MIC, yellow dots, tracking dots, secret dots) under UV-light in regular (red and blue markings) and irregular arrangement (green). Using this steganographic process, high-quality copies of an original (e.g. a bank note) under blue light can be made identifiable. Using this process, even shredded prints can be identified: the 2011 \\"Shredder Challenge\\" initiated by the DARPA was solved by a team called \\"All Your Shreds Are Belong To U.S.\\" consisting of Otavio Good and two colleagues. ==Protection of privacy and circumvention== Copies or printouts of documents with confidential personal information, for example health care information, account statements, tax declaration or balance sheets, can be traced to the owner of the printer and the creation date of the documents can be revealed. This traceability is unknown to many users and inaccessible, as manufacturers do not publicize the code that produces these patterns. It is unclear which data may be unintentionally passed on with a copy or printout. In particular, there are no mentions of the technique in the support materials of most affected printers (exceptions see below). In 2005 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sought a decoding method and made available a Python script for analysis. In 2018, scientists from the TU Dresden developed and published a tool to extract and analyze the steganographic codes of a given color printer and subsequently to anonymize prints from that printer. The anonymization works by printing additional yellow dots on top of the Machine Identification Code.DEDA - tracking Dots Extraction, Decoding and Anonymisation toolkit: The scientists made the software available in order to support whistleblowers in their efforts to publicize grievances. ==Comparable processes== Other methods of identification are not as easily recognizable as yellow dots. For example, a modulation of laser intensity and a variation of shades of grey in texts are already feasible. , it was unknown whether manufacturers were also using these techniques.Printer Characterization and Signature Embedding for Security and Forensic Applications Pei-Ju Chiang, Aravind K.

Congenitally (primary) caused condylar hypoplasia leads to underdeveloped condyle at birth. Hypoplasia of mandible can be diagnosed during birth, in comparison to the hyperplasia which is only diagnosed later in growth of an individual. == Types ==  Congenital (primary)  Congenital condylar hypoplasia happens when a person is born with smaller condyle than normal. The small condyle can be present either one or both sides of the lower jaw. This type of condition usually happens as part of systemic diseases such as Hemifacial microsomia, Mandibulofacial Dysostosis, Goldenhar syndrome, Hurler syndrome, Proteus syndrome and Morquio syndrome.  Acquired (secondary)  Acquired condylar hypoplasia happens when a person is not born with a small condyle but they sustain an injury during their growth which leads to this condition. The injury causes stop of growth in the condyle, resulting in a smaller condyle. The type of injuries that can happen are most traumatic in nature. Injury or infection related to ear, childhood rheumatoid arthritis and parathyroid hormone related deficiency are known to cause the injury. == Presentation== Individuals with condylar hypoplasia may present with small mandible, symmetry in lower jaw and increased overjet. Depending on the presence or absence of the condyle, an individual may have limited opening of the mouth. ==Diagnosis Treatment == Treatment of this condyle usually requires a multi-team approach involving an oral surgeon, an orthodontist and a plastic surgeon. A treatment usually involves some type of bone graft from one's own body to their low jaw. A costochondral bone graft has been successfully used to add bone to the mandible by oral and plastic surgeons. This type of graft can be lengthened by a procedure known as distraction osteogenesis which adds bone to the already placed graft. The graft is usually placed before the growth spurt occurs in an individual. The graft placement is later followed by an orthognathic surgery after the growth has finished in an individual. == See also == * Condylar hyperplasia * Craniofacial team * Distraction osteogenesis * Hemifacial microsomia == References == Category:Orthodontics ","title":"Condylar hypoplasia"},{"id":"54262460","text":"Desulfoconvexum algidum is a psychrophilic, strictly anaerobic and sulfate- reducing bacterium from the genus of Desulfoconvexum which has been isolated from cold marine sediments from Smeerenburgfjorden in Norway. == References  External links == *Type strain of Desulfoconvexum algidum at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Desulfobacterales Category:Bacteria described in 2013 Category:Psychrophiles ","title":"Desulfoconvexum algidum"},{"id":"54262481","text":"The canton of Aurillac-1 is an administrative division of the Cantal department, southern France.

She also joined the National Federation of Women Teachers inside the NUT and became honorary secretary in 1913. She took over this position from Joseph Tate. She resigned from teaching in 1917 to become the first full-time paid secretary of the federation. She helped created the NUWT as a break-away group from the NUT as a feminist autonomous union.

She argued for equal pay at Trafalgar Square and at country-wide meetings. She was also an organizer and unifier within the NUWT, and often pulled together campaigns with other feminist groups, such as the Open Door Council and the Six Point Group in the 1920s. == Politics == To defend her position that women should take part in public affairs, she ran for St Pancras Borough Council on the Labour Party platform in November 1925, but was unsuccessful. Her campaign slogan was 'deeds not words', also the slogan of the WSPU. == Personal life == Froud never married and was quoted as saying 'we can't have it said that we celibates are only some fraction of a human being'. She lived in Sussex Downs after retirement, where she died on 21 May 1941.

Sponsored by Arizona Democrat Morris Udall, the law added approximately 400,000 thousand acres of wilderness in California, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming, to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Other sections of the law established three new Wilderness Areas in Oregon and added additional acreage to two existing areas, and ordered the creation of a committee to develop a management plan for 330,000 acres of public land along the Salmon River in Idaho known as the Gospel-Hump area. ==Background== Responding to a heightened public interest in conservation and an increased threat to public lands by development, and other intrusive or consumptive activities, such as logging, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964, Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S.C. 1131-1136) on September 3, 1964. Created, in the words of the law, ‚Äúto secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness,‚Äù the law created the National Wilderness Preservation System and a set of criteria and administrative processes by which natural areas could be added to this system.16 U.S.C. 1131-1136 Under this new law, proposed areas on U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could be designated as Wilderness Areas, special reserves protected from human encroachment and development. Within these areas, unless specially exempted, Congress mandated that there ‚Äúshall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area...there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area.‚Äù To be kept in as close to a pristine natural state as possible, these areas would only be open to hikers and backpackers, who would be expected to follow low-impact, ‚ÄúLeave No Trace‚Äù camping practices. ==Legislative History== What would become Public Law 95-237 was not the first bill introduced in 1977 that used the name Endangered American Wilderness Act. Several earlier bills, including H.R. 1207 (95th), sponsored by Robert Roe, (D) the Representative for New Jersey's 8th congressional district, and two resolutions, H.R. 14524 (94th) and H.R. 14774 (94th), both sponsored by Morris Udall, (D), the representative for Arizona's 2nd congressional district, were allowed to die in committee. Undaunted, Udall introduced a version of the bill on February 9, 1977, which moved to the House National Resources Committee as H.R. 3454 (95th). Passing the committee, the bill was approved by the full House on September 12, 1977, and sent to the Senate. After passing the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the bill was approved, with changes, on October 20, 1977 and returned to the House for approval. Once granted, the bill was signed into law on February 24, 1978, by President Jimmy Carter, becoming Public Law 95-237. ==Section I== Farewell Gap in the Goldern Trout Wilderness, Inyo and Sequoia National Forests Noting that ‚Äúmany areas of undeveloped national forest land exhibit outstanding natural characteristics giving them high value as wilderness,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthese and other undeveloped national forest lands exhibiting wilderness values are immediately threatened by pressures of a growing and more mobile population, large-scale industrial and economic growth, and development and uses inconsistent with the protection, maintenance, restoration, and enhancement of their wilderness character,‚Äù Title I of the law established a number of new protected Wilderness Areas on National Forest lands in Wyoming, California, Utah, and New Mexico. ==Section II== Section II of the law listed the new Wilderness Areas to be established, along with their total acreage and the parent Forest of which they were part. These included: *the 56,430 acre Pusch Ridge Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest *the 306,000 acre Golden Trout Wilderness in the Inyo and Sequoia National Forests *the 21,250 acre Santa Lucia Wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest *the 61,000 acre Ventana Wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest *the 74,450 acre Hunter- Fryingpan Wilderness in the White River National Forest *the 30,930 acre Manzano Mountain Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest *the 50,000 acre Chama River Canyon Wilderness in the Santa Fe and Carson National Forests *the 29,567 acre Lone Peak Wilderness in the Wasatch and Uinta National Forests *the 14,904 acre Savage Run Wilderness in the Medicine Bow National Forest *the 28,440 acre Welcome Creek Wilderness in the Lolo National Forest ==The Oregon Omnibus Wilderness Act of 1978== The Sandy River in the Mount Hood Wilderness Section III of Title One, also known as the Oregon Omnibus Wilderness Act of 1978, added three new Wilderness Areas to the National Wilderness Preservation System and added additional lands to two existing Wilderness Areas.

The law approved the establishment of a 206,000 acre area, which had been previously proposed as a Wilderness Area, as the Gospel- Hump Wilderness. This section also ordered the Secretary of Agriculture, as responsible official for the Forest Service, to assemble a committee charged with the creation of a multipurpose resource development plan that would make recommendations for the use of two sections near the forest, a 92,000 acre ‚ÄúManagement Area‚Äù and a 45,000 acre ‚ÄúDevelopment Area,‚Äù both of which consisted of land-less roads contiguous with the Wilderness. This is to have seven members: two members from the timber industry who purchase timber from the Nezperce National Forest, two members from organizations who are actively engaged in seeking the preservation of wilderness lands, and three members from the general public who otherwise have a significant interest in the resources and management of the Gospel-Hump Area. The completed management plan was then to be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture, along with the results of a comprehensive state and federal research program into local fish and game populations also ordered and funded in this bill. ==Section V== This section noted that the Wilderness Areas established in the law should consider the date of the passage of the law as the effective date of their creation, and the date at which the strictures of the Wilderness Area designation went into effect, with the exception of the Gospel-Hump Area, whose effective date of creation was extended five years into the future, owing to the need to draw up and implement the previously discussed multipurpose development plan. ==Section VI== The final section of the law ordered that maps and legal descriptions of the newly established Wilderness Areas should be delivered to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and that the boundaries and descriptions submitted should have the ‚Äúsame force and effect as if included in this Act.‚Äù ==See also== *Wilderness Act of 1964 ==References== Category:United States federal public land legislation ","title":"Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978"},{"id":"54262753","text":"The second May ministry was formed on 11 June 2017 after Queen Elizabeth II invited Theresa May to form a government following the June 2017 snap general election. The election resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservative Party losing its majority in the House of Commons. On 9 June 2017, May announced her intention to form a Conservative minority government, reliant on the confidence and supply of the Democratic Unionist Party; a finalised agreement between the two parties was signed and published on 26 June 2017. May announced on 24 May 2019 that she would resign as Leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June. She remained in office as caretaker during the resulting Conservative Party leadership election, before resigning on 24 July, after which she was succeeded as Prime Minister by Boris Johnson. ==History== The 2017 snap election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party holding the most seats in the House of Commons, but without an overall majority. The DUP had suggested it would be able to provide a coalition or confidence and supply arrangement depending on negotiations. Theresa May, incumbent Conservative prime minister, announced her intention on 9 June 2017 to form a new minority government with support from the DUP. Both parties have signalled that this support will be in the form of a confidence and supply agreement, rather than a formal coalition. There has been a formal legal challenge, claiming the agreement between the Tories and the DUP contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the Bribery Act. On 10 June, a survey of 1,500 ConservativeHome readers found that almost two-thirds of Conservative Party members wanted Theresa May to resign. A YouGov poll of 1,720 adults for the Sunday Times had 48% saying Theresa May should resign, with 38% against. A Survation poll of 1,036 adults online for the Mail on Sunday had 49% of people wanting her resignation, with 38% against. On 10 June 2017, 10 Downing Street issued a statement that a Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement was reached in principle. A few hours later, the statement was retracted when it was said that it had been \\"issued in error\\" and that talks between the Conservative Party and DUP were still ongoing. Former Prime Minister, John Major was concerned that a deal between the Conservatives and DUP could endanger the Northern Irish peace process. On 11 June 2017, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne described May as a \\"dead woman walking\\". David Lidington disagrees. Senior Labour politicians stated that they plan to challenge the Conservative minority government early and to put forward alternative policies in the reply to the Queen's Speech. Jeremy Corbyn said he believed there is a majority in parliament for many issues on which Labour \\"is sympathetic\\", giving as examples the repeal of the Under-occupancy penalty ('bedroom tax'), and maintaining the triple lock on pensions and the winter fuel allowance. In an interview conducted on 11 June, Corbyn stated that he expected another election to be held within a year. Michael Gove said the minority government will probably reduce austerity and increase spending on public services. Stephen Bush of the New Statesman also expects less austerity. Bush notes if voters feel there is continued austerity in England, Scotland and Wales while the government spends generously in Northern Ireland to maintain the pact with the DUP then the Conservatives may become more unpopular. The 1% pay cap on public sector workers is under review according to 10 Downing Street. and increasing numbers of high ranking Conservatives want to end it. On the afternoon of 11 June, Theresa May finalised the composition of her cabinet. The senior positions of Chancellor, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary, as well as the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, had already been confirmed on 9 June with all four incumbents staying in office. The reshuffle saw prominent Brexiteer MPs, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, retain their roles, but also resulted in the promotion of Damian Green and David Gauke, politicians who had supported the remain side during the EU referendum. Junior ministerial roles were allocated the following day, with a full list of new ministerial and government appointments confirmed on 12 June. On 3 July 2017, polls suggested May's popularity had dropped drastically since the election on 8 June. 60% of voters viewed May less favourable than they did during the election, and 20% more disapproved than approved of May: 31% approved her leadership, while 51% disapproved. By 7 July, YouGov gave Labour an eight- point lead over the Conservatives (46% to 38%). A New Statesman article maintained a factor in this lead is ONS figures showing household disposable incomes falling faster than at any time since 2011. May reshuffled her cabinet on 8‚Äì9 January 2018. Amidst the thrice rejection by parliament of the agreement she negotiated to leave the European Union, May announced on 24 May 2019 that she would resign as leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June, though she continued to serve as a caretaker until Boris Johnson was elected leader and asked to form a new government on 24 July 2019. ==Cabinets== June 2017 ‚Äì January 2018 Changes *Following allegations of sexual misconduct, Michael Fallon resigned from his post of Defence Secretary on 1 November 2017.

He himself became a lecturer at the same university in 1863, teaching courses on the political history of classical antiquity and of the Middle Ages. From 1883 he also taught contemporary history. In 1891 he stopped teaching ancient history. His son, Alfred Alphonse Moeller, became a colonial administrator, governor of Orientale Province in the Belgian Congo, and later a businessman. To mark his fifty years of teaching at the university (1863‚Äì1913), a two- volume Festschrift was published by former members of the historical seminar in Leuven, M√©langes d'histoire offerts √† Charles Moeller (Leuven and Paris, 1914).Both volumes in one at Internet Archive. At the outbreak of the First World War he briefly became a refugee in Oxford. In 1916 he was appointed director of the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome.

The village was a formidable center of Jewish activity prior to World War II. The Polish village of Jagielnica is its namesake, and was founded by residents of this town fleeing Nazi occupation. ==Etymology== According to Polish researchers, the name \\"Jagielnica\\" derives from \\"Jagiellonian\\", the name of the Polish royal family. Ukrainian researcher Mikhail Kryschuk wrote in his 2011 book Toponomy of Ternopil that the Ukrainian \\"Yahil'nytsya\\" may derive from the Lithuanian name for the Slavic deity Jarilo and/or the Tatar word meaning \\"hell\\" or \\"lofty place\\" (, yagel). ==History== Archeology suggests the territory occupied by the modern town was inhabited as far back as 3000 BC, as evidenced by uncovered burials dating to the Bronze Age. Nevertheless, Yahil'nytsya is first mentioned with its more recognizably historical name of \\"Jagielnica\\" in 1448 after being visited by the Polish king Casimir IV. In 1454, the town was ruled by Teodoryk Buczacki Jaz≈Çowiecki of the Buczacki (Abdank) nobility. In 1517, Jagielnica became a private town of a nobility, and a year later it was granted with official town status. In 1581, king Stephen B√°thory handed Jagielnica and a number of other land portions to the voivode Stanis≈Çaw Lanckoro≈Ñski (died 1535) as reward for his loyal service to the queen Anna Jagiellon. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the town saw intense fighting as the citizens attempted to overthrow what they perceived as a society controlled by Poles and Turks. Armies lead by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky failed to storm the Yahilnytskoho castle, located in the town. The town was captured by the Cossacks in 1655, but was returned to Poland two years later as part of the Truce of Andrusovo. Following subsequent conflicts, Jagielnica was briefly controlled by Turkic forces between 1669-1672, and later by Austria from 1772 onwards. During this time, town was a significant geopolitical entity in southwestern Ukraine. Following the Austrian annexation in 1772, Jagielnica was made part of the Zalishchyky County, the Habsburg (Galician) predecessor to the modern Zalishchyky Raion. Industry increased over the following centuries. In 1904, a fire in the town razed twenty buildings and left fifty families homeless. In October 1914, Russian forces began occupation of Jagielnica as the front line pushed into the town for most of the war. In July 1917, Central Powers forces pushed through nearby Ternopil and broke through Russian trenches, forcing Russian troops in Jagielnica to retreat, ultimately allowing Austria-Hungary to capture and annex the town. Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Jagielnica was part of the land proclaimed to be the new West Ukrainian People's Republic. In the subsequent wars, Jagielnica became the scene of the great Chortkiv offensive. Jagielnica became part of Poland once again following the Peace of Riga which ended the wars in 1921. In 1929, Jagielnica merged with numerous other towns in the area. During the Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia in the 1930s, Ukrainians were banned from Jagielnica, now called Yahil'nytsya, in favor of allowing entry to Rusyns. During this period, it was a crime to show Ukrainian pride in any way. In 1934, Yahil'nytsya's status as a town was revoked by the government. During World War II, the USSR secured control over Yahil'nytsya and murdered several prominent villagers through the NKVD. In 1939, residents of Yahil'nytsya fled over the Polish border to escape the Russians, forming the village of Jagielnica in remembrance. From July 6, 1941 to March 24, 1944, Yahil'nytsya was controlled by Nazi forces, many Jews were slaughtered. On November 27, 1942, more than 52 people from both Yahil'nytsya and nearby Chortkiv were executed for alleged cooperation with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in what is now called the \\"Yahilnytsya tragedy\\". A memorial dedicated to this event was erected in 1992. The town experienced at least two mass shootings of Jewish prisoners. Yahil'nytsya returned to Communist control following the end of the war, and in 1948 more than 167 farms were forced to collectivize during the Three-Year Plan. Yahil'nytsya has been controlled by independent Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. ==References== * Bubernak, C. Legend of Yahilnitsyu. - (1997) * Bubernak, C.

Two buildings within the area are the Mercado Puerto (English: Port Market), built in 1924, and Iglesia de la Matriz (English: Church of the Matrix). Mercado Puerto is located near the site where Juan de Saavedra landed in 1543, at what is now Plaza Echaurren. Between 2002, when the building was restored, and the 2010 Chile earthquake, the mercado was the site of several seafood restaurants. Near it and Plaza Wheelwright is the Iglesia de la Matriz, an adobe church, known for its octagonal steeple, that was built in 1837. It is the site of the first church built for the city in 1559. The king and queen of Spain donated a 17th-century Spanish carving of Christ in Agony to the church. Plaza Wheelwright is named for William Wheelwright, an American who established a fleet of ships and railroads in Chile. A statue of him is located in the plaza. At the plaza, also called Plaza Aduana, is the custom house, Aduana, that was built in 1854 and 1855. The area also has hotels for sailors who visit the port. ==Renovation== There have been plans over the years to improve the crime- ridden area and restore the community, but there has not been much success and many of its residents and businesses have moved to other parts of the city. In 2015, Valpara√≠so Ciudad Creativa, innovadora y Sustentable (English: Valpara√≠so City Creative, Innovative and Sustainable) was implemented in 2016 as part of the Programa de Apoyo al Entorno Emprendedor de Corfo (English: Support Program for Entrepreneurial Environment of Corfo) to restore the historic patrimonial neighborhoods and encourage tourism. Residents of the Barrio Bustamante and Plaza Bustamante held a street festival with food and entertainment, following a week in which the facades of business and historic buildings were painted as part of the Barrio Puerto's renovations. == Main sights ==  Plaza Sotomayor   Muelle Prat  Muelle Prat (Prat Pier) is located in west side of Plaza Sotomayor, Valparaiso. It was established in the 1930sValparaiso, capital cultural. Chile. 2010. P. 181. Retrieved June 16, 2017. and all the port activity from Valparaiso can be found there. A fender of about a kilometer long is seen projected towards the sea at one side of the pier, which serves as an anchorage point for big draft boats. Muelle Prat is a great place for tourism since boat trips are offered in order to tour the port as well as craftwork shops and restaurants. The large underground parking lot built under the Plaza Sotomayor (Sotomayor Square) makes it easier for visitors to get there and enjoy the attractions.  Navy Headquarters  The Comandancia de la Armada (Navy Headquarters) is located in Plaza Sotomayor. It was designed to serve as the headquarters of the Government of the Province of Valparaiso, residence of the intendent, a place of official receptions, and summer residence of the presidents of the Republic. This building was built in 1908‚Äì1910, on the same site that occupied the first Intendance, built at the beginning of the 19th century and demolished in 1900. The work was designed and directed by the architect Ernesto Urquieta, who was inspired by the Paris city hall, applying forms and elements of the French Renaissance from the period of Louis XVI; the forms being noticed in the organization of the central body and in the accused stonework of the Zocalo, and the elements in the serene elegance of the lateral bodies. Because of its location and its unique presence, the Palace of the Former Intendance presides over the Plaza Sotomayor (Sotomayor Square). Its fa√ßade presents a varied ornamentation of plaster and artificial stone characteristic of the Art Nouveau, highlighting a set of incoming and outgoing volumes and numerous bays that generate movement in the plane. In the upper part there is a clock and a dome, and the windows of the third floor have balconies facing the Sotomayor square. The central access to this palace consists of a large marble staircase with two small balustrades. The doors are protected by an iron lattice. During the first years this building was constituted in a center of great celebrations that congregated the high society. At present it is occupied by the Commander in Chief of the First Naval Zone. ==References External links == * Barrio Puerto Valpara√≠so Category:Valpara√≠so ","title":"Barrio Puerto"},{"id":"54263138","text":"Flindersiella endophytica is an endophytic bacterium from the genus Flindersiella which has been isolated from the tree Eucalyptus microcarpa in Adelaide in Australia. == References == Category:Propionibacterineae Category:Bacteria described in 2011 ","title":"Flindersiella endophytica"},{"id":"54263154","text":"H√©bertville is a municipality in Quebec.

There were no injuries and only minor damage. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. A Syrian resident of Malm√∂ was arrested, tried and acquitted and the incident was deemed to be arson, but not terrorism. In June 2017, a man was arrested in Germany, accused of working for the ISIS-related news agency, Amaq. Police claim he had contacted the accused before and after this attack in order to report back to Amaq. ==Events== A 30-year-old Syrian man was arrested in December 2016, accused of throwing the fire bomb that set off the fire, causing damage to the building. At trial in early June, 2017, the accused was acquitted of all charges and the fire was deemed to be arson, but not to be terrorism-related. After being acquitted, the accused was immediately remanded to the custody of the Swedish Security police S√§po, where procedures were activated to open a case under the Foreign Immigration Control law to establish whether his residency status should be revoked and he should be deported to his country of origin on the grounds of having ties with ISIS and of posing a threat to national security. ==Allegations of ISIS involvement== According to The Local, investigators had found a description of how to make a detonator on the accused man's computer, along with ISIS propaganda films showing Islamic State militants fighting and killing \\"infidels\\" and also the image of an Isis flag. In October 2016, the ISIS magazine al-Naba claimed that the arson was committed by \\"a warrior from the caliphate,\\" who acted \\"on the instructions of the leader al-Adnani\\", Isis spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, and described the arson fire as the Islamic State's first attack on Scandinavia. Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp dismissed the ISIS claim, but terrorism expert Hans Brun of King's College London, noted that given the paucity of press coverage, the question was how the ISIS news agency \\"got access to this information\\". In June 2017, German police arrested a 23 year old Syrian man identified only as Mohammed G., accusing him of being an Isis member and of passing on information to the Amaq News Agency since September 2015. German police accused Mohammad G. of communicating with the alleged perpetrator of the Malm√∂ arson attack on social media. According to the German prosecutor's office, \\"One day after this attack, the accused demanded from his contact person (in Sweden) a personal claim of this deed..., The background was that Amaq did not want to issue a report about the attack without such a claim\\". Following the arrest of Mohammad G., Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King's College, London, said \\"We've all assumed that they are reading news reports, and then saying, 'Our guy did this.' But this is interesting because this does show that they clearly have someone, who is one of their guys, and who is getting verification and confirming that this attack was in our name\\", however Maher cautioned that the German police statement had mentioned only a single example of such confirmation. ==Response== In a speech in February 2017, Donald Trump stated that the media was not reporting on terrorist attacks. Later that day, the Trump administration included this event in a list of 78 attacks which the admin said were \\"under-reported\\". ==See also== *Malm√∂ Synagogue attacks *Malm√∂ Mosque attacks *2014 mosque arson attacks in Sweden *Arson attacks on asylum centres in Sweden ==References== Category:2016 crimes in Sweden Category:Attacks on Shiite mosques Category:Violence against Shia Muslims Category:Arson in Sweden Category:2010s in Malm√∂ Category:Attacks in 2016 Category:October 2016 crimes in Europe ","title":"2016 Malm√∂ Muslim community centre arson"},{"id":"54263168","text":"Cornerstone ceremony th the access road to Quneitra border crossing in Israel in the memory of Francis Vib Sanziri, July 2019 Francis Vib Sanziri (1957 ‚Äì 19 April 2019) was a Ghanaian military officer who served in the Ghana Army.

It was published by CRC Press in 2014. The book discusses the terrorist evolution of the Iraqi insurgency which led to the formation of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration for causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader Paul Bremer. The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected to learn from the Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor of the Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in the interests of all parties involved. A review of the book in the journal Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism and Political Aggression recommended the work, writing The Terrorists of Iraq, \\"offers enormous precious experience and empirical data which make it attractive to policy-makers\\". The Times of Israel published a book review which was praiseworthy of the author's expertise, writing, \\"For those that want to truly understand the Iraq conflict and its surrounding issues, Nance is eminently qualified and this book is uniquely superb.\\" Christopher Hitchens wrote for Vanity Fair, \\"The Terrorists of Iraq, is a highly potent analysis...of the jihadist threat\\". Ben Rothke placed the book among \\"The Best Information Security Books of 2015\\", in a post for The Security Reading Room. Spencer Ackerman said Nance's books The Terrorists of Iraq and Defeating ISIS reflected the caliber of his expertise in the subject matter. ==Background== Malcolm Nance, author of The Terrorists of Iraq Malcolm Nance is a retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer in naval cryptology. He garnered expertise within the fields of intelligence and counterterrorism. He served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, from 1981‚Äì2001. Nance was an interpreter for Russian, and began working in the intelligence field through research into the history of the Soviet Union and its spying agency the KGB. He devoted years of research to analyzing Middle East terrorism and sovereign nations with ties to Russia. He graduated from New York's Excelsior College with a degree in Arabic. Nance took part in combat operations which occurred after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, was involved with the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, served on the USS Wainwright during Operation Praying Mantis and participated in the sinking of Iranian missile boat Joshan, served on the USS Tripoli during the Gulf War, and assisted during a Banja Luka, Bosnia air strike. After retiring from military service, Nance founded a consulting company based in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. where he provided advising services to United States Special Operations Command. During the September 11 attacks, Nance personally witnessed American Airlines Flight 77 crash into The Pentagon and he assisted in rescue operations at the impact site. He created a training center called the Advanced Terrorism, Abduction and Hostage Survival School. Nance manages a think tank analyzing counterterrorism called \\"Terror Asymmetrics Project on Strategy, Tactics and Radical Ideologies\\", consisting of Central Intelligence Agency and military intelligence officers with direct prior field experience. Nance is a member of the board of directors for the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. Nance's books on counter- terrorism include: An End to al-Qaeda, Terrorist Recognition Handbook, The Plot to Hack America, Defeating ISIS, and Hacking ISIS. ==Summary== The Terrorists of Iraq traces terrorist roots of the insurgency within Iraq which yielded the development of the later terrorist group known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Although the book was written before the New York Times 2014 front page story detailing the actual existence of WMD in Iraq, Nance faults the decision to begin the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration as the impetus for subsequent chaos within the region. He notes the Iraq war was supported by a false premise, and asserts that subsequent chaos in the country was exacerbated by mismanagement from individuals including Paul Bremer, provisional leader of the country while the war was still ongoing. Nance asserts that the United States did not adequately learn from the past mistakes of the Vietnam War and the 1920 uprising by the people of Iraq against the United Kingdom forces. He notes these events could have imparted valuable pointers to the Bush Administration such as the notion that terrorism tactics used by insurgency operations including guerrilla warfare were difficult to defeat effectively, even in the face of overwhelming U.S. military forces. Nance recounts lessons learned from the Lebanon war with Israel in 1992, particularly how the subsequent occupation of Lebanon by Israel could have provided the U.S. with significant ways to improve their strategy in the Iraqi invasion in 2003. Nance compares the two occupation force strategies, and argues each left their occupiers with many deaths and few tangible results. The book discusses the Obama Administration Iranian nuclear development limitations agreement. Nance argues that it is a promising endeavor and in the best interests of Iran, as it opens the door for them to acquire the Western products they desire. Nance analyzes the diplomatic and military strategies available to the U.S. to deal with the Iran nuclear situation. He warns that war with Iran in order to potentially limit their nuclear capabilities would lead to financial ruin in America, retaliatory strikes against Israel, increased oil prices, conflict by Iran with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and closure of shipping lanes for oil. Nance acknowledges Iran's significant contributions to terrorism around the world, but argues that a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue is a worthwhile endeavor. ==Release and reception== The book was published in 2014 by CRC Press, in a revised edition in hardcover format. CRC Press published an e-book edition the same year. The book was published in 2007 by BookSurge Publishing in a paperback format under the slightly revised title, The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency. CRC Press released another edition in print and e-book format in 2015. Another print edition was published in 2015 by Taylor & Francis. The book was required reading by Tufts University in a 2015 college-level course, \\"Iraq: A State in Flux\\". Christopher Hitchens wrote in an article for Vanity Fair, \\"The Terrorists of Iraq, is a highly potent analysis both of the jihadist threat in Mesopotamia and of the ways in which we have made its life easier.\\" The Guardian national security reporter Spencer Ackerman said, \\"If you‚Äôve read books like The Terrorists of Iraq and Defeating ISIS, you know Malcolm's expertise.\\" ShadowProof journalist Matt Duss called The Terrorists of Iraq, \\"a detailed description of the various factions and movements ... fighting U.S. forces in Iraq.\\" A review of the book in the academic journal Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism and Political Aggression by Chi Zang, recommended the work as a resource for those researching the subject matter including individuals drafting legislation to address the issues involved and academics. The review in Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism and Political Aggression concluded, \\"This book is easy to read, vivid, and offers enormous precious experience and empirical data which make it attractive to policy-makers, scholars, and students.\\" The Times of Israel published a book review of The Terrorists of Iraq, by contributor Ben Rothke. Rothke wrote that The Terrorists of Iraq, \\"provides a deep understanding of the subject.\\" The reviewer highly recommended the book, and wrote highly of the author's expertise in the subject matter, \\"For those that want to truly understand the Iraq conflict and its surrounding issues, Nance is eminently qualified and this book is uniquely superb.\\" Rothke concluded, \\"There is no better book than The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003‚Äì2014 on the subject.\\" Rothke placed the book among \\"The Best Information Security Books of 2015\\", in a post for The Security Reading Room.

Throughout British rule and World War II, the Military Medical Corps was largely made up of personnel who volunteered their services and was not a formal organisation part of the defence of Singapore until 1967, when the Senior Medical Officer's department was formed. In 1972, HQ Medical Services was established to oversee all military medical services and policies within the defence force and in 1974, the armed forces began recruitment of doctors for national service. ==Structure== SAF Medical Training Institute Part of the SAF Medical Corps is the SAF Medical Training Institute (SMTI) where national servicemen and women are trained in and equipped with the knowledge and skills to operate as Combat Medics and Combat Medic Specialists.

The legislation passed the House 233‚Äì186 on June 8, 2017. The 600-page legislation was crafted by Congressman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), chair of the House Financial Services Committee. ==Timeline== The bill passed the Republican-led House on June 8, 2017 along party lines. The next stage is in the Senate where, under the leadership of chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID), they are taking a \\"bipartisan approach\\" to craft their own \\"regulatory relief bill for Wall Street and community banks\\" that would be able to \\"clear a 60-vote threshold\\". Crapo is working closely with Senator Sherrod Brown (D), the \\"top Democrat on the panel\\". ==Dodd-Frank== The 2010 Dodd-Frank reform financial regulatory legislation was enacted during the Obama administration in response to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. It amended the Commodity Exchange Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, the Federal Reserve Act, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, the International Banking Act of 1978, the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act, the Revised Statutes of the United States, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Truth in Lending Act. ==Proposed legislative reforms== The legislation aims to undo many key provisions of the 2010 Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act. If the legislation is passed, the president would have the power to fire directors of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \\"which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\\", and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). (The CFPB, an agency responsible for protecting consumers in the financial sector was created by Dodd-Frank.) It would also give \\"Congress purview over the CFPB's budget, meaning lawmakers could defund the agency entirely\\". The law, if enacted, would also prohibit the CFPB from regulating small-dollar credit or restricting arbitration, being responsible for supervision of banks and other financial institutions as well as market monitoring. The CFPB will no longer have the authority to prohibit Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices and will be limited to enforcement actions and rules derived directly from consumer protection laws. Dodd-Frank's Orderly Liquidation Authority, \\"which allows the federal government to step in if a bank is near collapse to provide a backstop to ensure the institution's failure would not spread to the rest of financial system\\", would be eliminated. The bill also includes proposals requiring the Federal Reserve Bank to adhere to mathematical rules for setting monetary policy (particularly federal funds rate targeting), based on the Taylor Rule. Critics of the Taylor Rule have argued that its adoption following the 2008 Financial Crisis would have resulted in negative interest rates. ==Response from Republicans== Paul Ryan said, \\"We see the Financial Choice Act as the crown jewel of this effort. The Dodd-Frank Act has had a lot of bad consequences for our economy, but most of all in the small communities across our country.\\" \\"The CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and delivers the regulatory relief these banks so desperately need...This will change our communities, because these small banks are the lifeblood of our Main Streets.\\" ==Response from Democrats== Democrats expressed concern that the legislation \\"would remove some of the most vital protections that were included in the Dodd-Frank Act to prevent something like the financial crisis from happening again\\". House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the House Republicans' \\"dangerous Wall Street-first\\" bill, saying it would \\"drag us back to the days of the Great Recession\\".

Former party chairman Steve Crowther was chosen three days later to serve as interim leader. On 11 August, the party confirmed that eleven candidates had been cleared to stand for the leadership. Subsequently, the number on the ballot fell to seven as four withdrew to support other candidates. The election was won by Henry Bolton with 30.0% of the vote.Henry Bolton elected UKIP leader. BBC NEWS. Published 29 September 2017. Retrieved 29 September 2017. == Election rules == The leadership contest took place under a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the greatest number of votes became leader. According to party rules, candidates had to have been party members for at least two years as of 23 June 2017, and needed the support of one hundred members across at least ten local parties. Candidates paid a ¬£5,000 deposit, half of which was refundable for candidates who received at least 20% of the vote.  Timetable  The election timetable is as follows: {  - 23 JuneOpening of nominations - 28 JulyClosing of nominations - 4 AugustList of applicants announced - 11 AugustDeadline for withdrawal of candidature and final list of candidates announced - 23 August ‚Äì 11 SeptemberProgramme of regional hustings - 1-8 SeptemberDespatch of ballot papers - 29 SeptemberCompletion of verification, count and declaration of the winner } == Campaign == There was immediate speculation that former leader Nigel Farage MEP might stand for a third period as leader. Bill Etheridge MEP and Thanet District Council leader Chris Wells both indicated they might stand if Farage did not. Farage subsequently announced in early July that he would not be standing. In the event, neither Etheridge nor Wells stood for the leadership; Etheridge became the running mate of John Rees-Evans. A key divide between candidates was between what The Guardian described as \\"Farage-ist economic libertarians\\" like Etheridge and the \\"more hard-right, Islam-focused\\" Anne Marie Waters and Peter Whittle. Etheridge stated that \\"whichever side wins, the other side won't have a future in the party\\". In early July, over a thousand new members had joined the party in only two weeks, leading to accusations of far-right infiltration in support of Waters. Party sources suggested Waters had concluded a deal with Whittle that were he to win, she would become deputy leader, which Whittle denied. Nominations closed on 28 July, with candidates then being approved as candidates by the party's executive. On 21 August the number fell to ten, when David Allen withdrew to support Henry Bolton. The number of candidates fell again on 31 August, to seven, as Ben Walker, David Coburn MEP and Marion Mason all stepped down in order to form a \\"Victory for the Ukip United\\" ticket with Jane Collins. The four wanted to see the party reflect Farage's leadership, rather than \\"banging on about Islam and gay marriage\\". Were Collins to be elected, Coburn would have become Deputy Leader with Walker as Party Chairman.  Controversy  At least 18 of the party's 20 MEPs were reported to be considering resigning and forming a new party if Waters won the leadership or was given a senior role in the party, given her anti-Islam views and support from the far-right. Etheridge publicly said that he would resign if Waters won, and Jonathan Arnott MEP said it would be difficult for him to remain. Etheridge subsequently launched his third leadership bid, having previously declared in both of UKIP's 2016 leadership elections. Etheridge withdrew his candidacy on 26 July, two days before close of nominations. He urged candidates from the \\"libertarian\\" wing of the party to unite against what he described as fringe candidates using the party \\"as a vehicle for the views of the EDL and the BNP\\". He said he would leave the party if Waters or Whittle won the leadership. Jack Buckby, a former parliamentary candidate for Liberty GB who as a former BNP member is barred from joining UKIP, was reported to be helping Waters in her campaign. Controversy over Waters continued, with Mike Hookem MEP resigning as the party's deputy whip in the European Parliament in protest at her candidacy and at the chief whip Stuart Agnew's support for her. Hookem described Waters as \\"far-right\\". Nathan Gill MEP also said he would leave the party if she won. Waters and Whittle both expressed concern at Sharia councils in the UK. LGBT rights defined another split between those who declared as candidates, with three (Whittle, Waters and Coburn) being openly gay, while David Kurten and John Rees-Evans had both said that they oppose same-sex marriage. Kurten faced criticism when he claimed that gay people are more likely to be abused as children. Whittle retorted: \\"Neither I, nor any of the gay friends and colleagues I have known over 35 years, were sexually abused.\\" In August, Rees-Evans announced a proposal to offer ¬£9,000 and health insurance to Britons with dual nationality, in return for them moving to countries where they have the right to settle. They would be required to start a business and trade with the UK. This would be to help achieve \\"negative net immigration towards one million a year\\", and would be funded by cutting the foreign aid budget. He was condemned by rivals Whittle and Collins; both Collins and Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake compared the proposal to the BNP's manifesto. On 24 August, Lawrence Webb, UKIP group leader on Havering London Borough Council and former mayoral candidate, tweeted that he \\"won‚Äôt stand for 2018 local elections if Peter Whittle wins\\". The following day, the Romford Recorder reported that all six of Havering Council‚Äôs UKIP councillors \\"will not stand in next year‚Äôs local elections if Peter Whittle is named leader of their party\\". == Candidates == {  style=\\"width:100%; text- align:center;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20%;\\" Candidate !

He went on to be sacked as party leader by a vote at an emergency conference of the party in February 2018. Waters described the election result as a victory of jihad against truth. Singer Morrissey claimed that the party had rigged the vote in order to prevent Waters from winning. Rees-Evans resigned from UKIP to found a new political party, called Affinity, but instead joined the Democrats and Veterans party and assuming its leadership. Waters set up a new political party, For Britain. Powlesland left UKIP and stood as a local election candidate for the Libertarian Party UK in May 2018. == References == Category:2017 elections in the United Kingdom 2017 Category:September 2017 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2017 UK Independence Party leadership election"},{"id":"54263581","text":"Javier Souza D√≠az (born 13 November 1929) is a Mexican sprinter.

Born into Hemi Naga tribe that lived predominantly in Myanmar, his early childhood was shaped by the opening up of isolated Naga communities by the World War II. During the War, the Western Allies built the long Stilwell Road connecting Ledo in India's Assam to China's Kunming to carry supplies against the Japanese Army, that passed through Waktham. This was said to have \\"sowed the seeds of insurgency in Khaplang.\\" Khaplang claimed that he first attended a school in Margherita, a town in Assam before joining Baptist Mission School in Myitkyina in Myanmar's Kachin State in 1959, and in 1961 to another missionary school in Kalay before he eventually dropped out. ==Insurgent activity== Allegedly influenced by the events of the War during his childhood, Khaplang founded the Naga Defence Force (NDF) in 1964 to operate towards a separate sovereign state for the Naga people. In 1965, he co-founded Eastern Naga Revolutionary Council (ENRC) that he later became the vice-chairman and then the chairman of. The two organizations helped Naga nationalist leader Angami Zapu Phizo's Naga National Council (NNC) to travel to China for weapons and training young recruits. Later, the two merged with the NNC and Khaplang became its chairman in 1974. During one of these visits, he met Thuingaleng Muivah, involved then with the NNC. They, along with another leader Isak Chishi Swu subsequently formed a partnership in revolting against the NNC for signing the Shillong Accord of 1975 that accepted the supremacy of the Indian Constitution. They broke away and formed the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) in 1980. The NSCN became very powerful and by 1985, it was running a parallel government in Nagaland, also extending its influence to adjoining districts of the neighbouring Indian States of Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. It was being called the 'mother of all insurgencies'. However, in April 1988, the NSCN split into two factions: the NSCN-K led by Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Swu and Muivah. Khaplang had made unsuccessful assassination attempt on Muivah. By 1989, the NSCN-K had driven out all Indian Naga people from Myanmar and the NSCN-IM shifted base to Thailand. Khaplang's influence in the region spread around this time. In addition to insurgent and anti-establishment activity, he gave space to other separatist outfits such as United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and I. K. Songbijit's faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB (Songbijit)), Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), Kangleipak Communist Party and Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup to set up hideouts alongside the NSCN-K's headquarters. While operating mostly in Nagaland, the NSCN-K subsequently made inroads into Changlang and Tirap districts of the neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh and later Assam. On 28 April 2001, the NSCN-K signed an agreement to one-year ceasefire with the government of India starting the same day. Khaplang announced of abrogating the agreement in March 2015. In April, leaders of the ULFA, NDFB (Songbijit), KLO and Khaplang of the NSCN-K assembled in Taga in Myanmar to form the United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) to achieve \\"united and total struggle\\" against the Indian establishment. Khaplang was chosen as the chairman. In June, the UNLFW killed 18 personnel while injuring over a dozen others Indian Army in an ambush in Manipur's Chandel district, the deadliest on the Army since 1983. A bounty of 7 lakh was declared by the National Investigation Agency for providing information on Khaplang. In September, the Ministry of Home Affairs declared NSCN-K an 'unlawful organisation' for a period of five years, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. ==Death== In his later life, Khaplang began to suffer from diabetes and other age-related ailments. He died of cardiac arrest on 9 June 2017 in Taga, in Myanmar's Naga Self-Administered Zone in Sagaing Region, where the NSCN-K was based during the time. It was reported that he had returned from China after a treatment and was to head to Waktham, his birthplace. Following his death, the then Chief Minister of Nagaland Shurhozelie Liezietsu revealed that \\"provided issues of substance were discussed\\", Khaplang was willing \\"to have dialogue with the government\\". Liezietsu added that, \\"It is tragic that such an important Naga leader like Mr Khaplang passed away at a time when the Naga political problem is on the verge of being resolved, and the need for all different Naga political groups to come together to air our views and aspirations to the Government of India in one voice is absolutely imperative.\\" ==See also== * Insurgency in Northeast India ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Naga people Category:Naga nationalism Category:20th-century Burmese people ","title":"S.

The Latvians were assisted by Finnish activists who opposed the Tsarist regime. With ƒåoke as the leader, the bank was robbed in 26 February. After the robbery, ƒåoke fled to Tampere where he handed the money over to the Russian Bolshevik Nikolay Burenin. He was soon caught in a local hotel, and taken to the police station, where ƒåoke managed to kill two police officers and one civil person assisting on his arrest. ƒåoke was sentenced to life in prison.

Nagel- Heyer was founded in 1992 by Hans and Sabine Nagel-Heyer to issue primarily live recordings of both North American and European jazz performers. By 2004 it had released nearly 200 albums. ==History== Sabine Nagel-Heyer managed a twenty-four hour jazz station in Germany. She and her husband, Hans, attended a concert in Bremen, Germany, by a group that included Kenny Davern, Eddie Higgins, George Masso, Danny Moss, and Randy Sandke. The promoter persuaded the couple to sponsor a concert in Hamburg on September 26, 1992, George Gershwin's birthday. The concert was recorded under the title the Wonderful World of George Gershwin, and when it was broadcast on the station, listeners wanted to buy a copy. The German government warned that the station's dwindling profits could lead to the loss of its license. The format was changed so that jazz aired only once a week, giving Sabine Nagel-Heyer time to concentrate on more live recordings. By 1994, the label released a new live concert every month. Nagel-Heyer concentrates on live recordings of mainstream jazz, sing, and Dixieland. The label's roster includes Harry Allen, Wycliffe Gordon, Byron Stripling, Donald Harrison, Ken Peplowski, and Randy Sandke. ==Artists== *Howard Alden *Harry Allen *Alan Barnes *Ruby Braff *Bill Charlap *Buck Clayton *Dylan Cramer *Wayne Escoffery *Wycliffe Gordon *Jake Hanna *Donald Harrison *Jeanie Lambe *Johannes Ludwig *Lyambiko *Susanne Menzel *Roy Powell *Marcus Printup *Eric Reed *Claudio Roditi *Randy Sandke *Martin Sasse *Zoot Sims *Terrell Stafford *Robert Stewart *Byron Stripling *Ralph Sutton *Clark Terry *Warren Vach√© *Frank Vignola *Sophie Wegener *Bob Wilber ==References== Category:German record labels Category:Record labels established in 1992 ","title":"Nagel-Heyer Records"},{"id":"54263883","text":"NGC 7029 is an elliptical galaxy located about 120 million Light-years away from Earth in the constellation Indus.

Chekhov agreed but in an 11 October letter informed Tikhonov that he had not yet decided on either story's title or even what it would be about, telling him, \\"you can [promise the subscribers] something that will be called either 'A Story' or 'Ordinary People', both would be spot on.\\" Levitan and Kuvshinnikova by Alexey Stepanov Chekhov set out to work on it on 21 November. James N. Loehlin writes that the story was influenced by Chekhov's earlier story \\"A Misfortune\\", which likewise told a tale of adultery.Loehlin, James N. (2010). The Cambridge Introduction to Chekhov, pp. 82. Cambridge University Press. . On 30 November he sent Tikhonov the manuscript of the story, originally titled \\"The Great Man\\" (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫, Velikiy chelovek). In an accompanying note he wrote: \\"Hereby I send you a little touching novel for a family reading. That's the promised 'Ordinary People', but now re-named.\\" This new title apparently did not satisfy him. After having read the proofs, he wrote Tikhonov on 14 December: \\"Really, I don't know what to do with my story's title. 'The Great Man' does not appeal to me at all... Call it 'The Grasshopper'... and don't forget to change it!\\" \\"The Grasshopper\\" was first published in the Nos. 1 and 2 (5 and 12 January 1892, respectively) issues of the Sever magazine. In a slightly changed version it was included into the Moscow-published Novellas and Stories (–ü–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã), 1894 collection, and later into Volume 8 of the Collected Works by A.P.

Modern literary historians take this for granted, although Chekhov himself denied it. On 29 April 1892 he wrote to his regular correspondent, the writer Lydia Avilova: \\"Yesterday I was in Moscow and all but choked myself to death with boredom and all kinds of misfortunes. Can you believe it, one my acquaintance, a dame of 42, had recognized herself in the 20-year-old heroine of my 'Grasshopper'... and now the whole Moscow seems to accuse me of smearing her good character. The only proof is superficial: the dame likes to paint in watercolors, her husband is a doctor and her lover a painter.\\" There story's plotline is very similar to the real life story of Kuvshinnikova's relationship with Isaak Levitan, and her husband's indeed very stoic reaction to it. The former was, though, by no means a despicable nonentity like Olga Ivanovna. Critics admired her work, one of her pictures had been bought by Pavel Tretyakov. On the other hand, Dmitry Kuvshinnikov was a very ordinary doctor without any ambitions. Critics argued later that Osip Dymov was more like the Moscow doctor Illarion Dubrovo, who indeed used to risk his life by tube-sucking diphteritis phlegm out of sick people's throats and in May 1883 died, having caught the infection this way.The Case of Medical Heroism. –î–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –î—ã–º–æ–≤ –±–µ–∑ ¬´–ü–æ–ø—Ä—ã–≥—É–Ω—å–∏¬ª. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞.Chekhov on the Russian doctor's Heroism // –õ. –ü. –ì—Ä–æ—Å—Å–º–∞–Ω. –ß–µ—Ö–æ–≤ –æ –ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞ // –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ. ‚Äî 1954. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 7-11. ‚Äî –°. 10.

All members of the small artistic circle which she is a hostess of, they all tell her she herself is a promising artist and pianist, the reputation she tries to uphold by practicing regularly and producing countless and, apparently, not very original 'etudes'. Olga's recently married; her husband Osip Dymov is on the staff of two hospitals (a ward-surgeon in one, a dissecting demonstrator in another). He is a modest, kind and good-natured man who's totally out of place in this community of flashy celebrities who consider him ordinary and ignore him. The brightest star of the bunch is the painter Ryabovsky, a handsome man who \\"had sold his last picture for five hundred roubles.\\" Olga goes with him on a steamboat trip down the Volga river, and they become lovers. Dymov gradually becomes aware of what's happening and reacts with characteristic mildness... \\"That man crushes me with his magnanimity,\\" Olga Ivanovna never tires to tell the people around her. He is almost sorry for his unfaithful wife, who soon indeed starts to suffer ‚Äì from humiliation and jealousy, as Ryabovsky gets first bored, then exasperated with her overbearing company. Finally, Ryabovsky gets himself another woman and Olga Ivanovna, dejected and outraged, returns home, dreaming of how she'd either commit suicide, or write Ryabovsky a scathing, condemning letter... Something happens, though, to detract her attention: it turns out that Dymov is seriously ill: he'd caught diphtheria at the hospital by sucking up the mucus through a pipette from a sick man's throat. Several of his colleagues come to stay on duty by his bedside: they all speak of how gifted was this extraordinary, rare man, promising to become such a celebrity and is now dying due to his own carelessness. Horrified with the realization, that, while hunting for artists and singers, she'd 'missed out on' what could have become a true celebrity and the greatest 'gem' in her collection through her silliness, Olga Ivanovna rushes to her husband's deathbed to explain how wrong she'd been and how everything could be different from now on... But Dymov is quiet now and his hands and forehead are very cold. == Reception == \\"The Grasshopper\\" was well received by both the critics and the readership. Sergey Andreevsky, reviewing Novellas and Stories collection called it 'a gem of a novella'.–ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è. 1895, ‚Ññ 6784, 17 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è Lev Tolstoy called it 'brilliant'. \\"...First humorous, then more and more somber... and how deeply one feels in the end, that his death would not alter her at all\\", he has quoted as saying by his personal doctor, D.P.

They made peace though three years later, due to the efforts of a mutual friend Tatiana Shchepkina-Kupernik, according to Mikhail Chekhov. Lensky did not speak to Chekhov for eight years, and Kuvshinnikova severed all ties with the author. ==ReferencesExternal links== * –ü–æ–ø—Ä—ã–≥—É–Ω—å—è, the original Russian text * The Grasshopper, 1918 English translation by Constance Garnett * Grasshopper, a 5-minute fragment from the 1955 adaptation by Samson Samsonov.

Rancho Mirage in California, 2017 The Latso Duo has resided in Vienna, Austria, from 2013-2019, where Giorgi had joined the piano faculty of the Vienna Prayner Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Arts as professor of piano and at the same time he was a guest professor at the Liceu Conservatory in Barcelona. Subsequently, since 2020 they have made their homes in Los Angeles. == Repertoire == The Latsos's repertoire ranges from Bach to 21st-century classical music, including all major works for piano four hands and orchestral transcriptions, with a focus on French, Russian and German composers.

The pianists have developed a close relationship with composer Joe Giarrusso, who created and dedicated some four-hand pieces especially for them. Since 2013 they have been performing worldwide as piano duo and have appeared at musical centers and festivals, including Chopin Music Festival, Aspen Music Festival, Steinway Festival, Yamaha Fesitval, Schubertiade Music Festival, the Osterfestival Tirol and the Ruhr Piano Festival. Extensive CD recording makes up an important part of their career: the Duo has released recordings of four-hand piano music not only with central works of the repertoire but also introducing less familiar names to a wide public.

The beetles burrow into the bark of spruce trees and lay eggs which develop into larvae that feed on the woody layers under the bark. == Description == The eggs of the great spruce bark beetle are smooth, white and translucent, and laid in batches of a hundred or more. The larvae are legless and \\"C\\"-shaped, white with darker heads. They are about long when mature. The pupae are white and \\"mummy-like\\"; they are exarate, with legs and wings separate from the body. The adults are between long and are cylindrical in shape and dark brown in colour. The limbs and antennae are yellowish-brown, the head is visible when viewed from above, and the elytral declivity, the downward sloping rear end of the elytra, is rounded and smooth. == Distribution == The great spruce bark beetle occurs in the coniferous forests of Europe and Asia. It is not clear where it originated and to which countries it is endemic, but it has been steadily expanding its range westward in Europe in the last hundred years, assisted by the transport of unprocessed logs. It is present in most of Northern, Eastern and Central Europe and has reached Belgium and France, and was first detected in the United Kingdom in 1982. In Asia, it is present in Hokkaido in Japan, and in the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Qinghai and Sichuan. It has been introduced into Turkey and Georgia, in both of which it is invasive. == Hosts == Oriental spruce killed by D. micans The great spruce bark beetle mainly infests spruce trees, genus Picea, but it will also attack Scots pine and several other species of Pinus, silver fir, Nordmann fir, Siberian fir, Douglas fir, and European larch. == Life cycle == Larvae of Dendroctonus micans The female beetle excavates a tunnel in the bark of a host tree and creates a brood chamber. Any resin that accumulates is mixed with frass (droppings) and pushed out of the tunnel, creating a purplish-brown mass known as a resin tube. A hundred or more eggs are laid in the brood chamber and the female moves on, either creating another brood chamber near the first or exiting the tree and starting again. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed gregariously, chewing their way in a broad front and packing in their frass behind them. There are five larval instars and when the larvae are fully developed, they create individual pupal chambers in the frass and pupate. The total development time varies with temperature and may be one to three years. The new adults may stay under the bark, mining new tunnels and creating new brood chambers, or they may emerge into the open air. Several females may mine the same area and their excavations may coalesce. == Ecology == The great spruce bark beetle is unusual among members of its genus in that the beetles mate before they emerge from under the bark, while they are not yet fully chitinised. There are many more female than male beetles, often 10/1 but exceptionally 45/1, and the matings are normally incestuous, being between siblings. The beetles emerge into the open air through a round hole which may be used by many beetles. They are weak fliers and many disperse by walking, tunnelling into a different part of the same tree. Others fly to nearby trees, and small groups of trees may be affected. Each tree is weakened by the tunnelling activities of the beetles and larvae; this kills the bark in a limited area, and it may be five to eight years before the tree is girdled and dies. In an attempt to control this beetle in the United Kingdom, the predatory beetle Rhizophagus grandis has been released. This specifically preys on the great spruce bark beetle and has a great ability to detect the adults and larvae infesting a tree. The predatory beetle is attracted to the frass produced by its prey which contains monoterpenes, and a suitable mixture of synthetic monoterpenes has been used to trap R. grandis in its native range, to provide insects for use in biological control. A rearing and release programme for R. grandis was also undertaken, and between 1984 and 1995, over a hundred and fifty thousand beetles were released in over two thousand sites in northwestern England and Wales, with surrounding areas of forest being quarantined. == References == Category:Scolytinae Category:Woodboring beetles Category:Beetles of Asia Category:Beetles of Europe Category:Beetles described in 1794 ","title":"Dendroctonus micans"},{"id":"54263982","text":"Tatarella is an Italian surname.

Tawhidi has been embraced by a number of far-right and Islamophobic groups. ==Early life and education== Tawhidi is a Shi'ite Muslim of Iraqi origin who was born in Qom, Iran, in 1982 or 1983. In 2009, he enrolled for a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies at Al-Mustafa University in Qom, but dropped out in 2012. He later worked for one of the Shirazi-run television stations in Karbala.Adcock, Bronwyn (25 June 2017). \\"Shadows of the Sheikh: how an Adelaide Imam with a mysterious past became a media star \\". ABC Radio National. Retrieved 28 July 2018. In 2015, he returned to Australia, and is currently based in Adelaide. He is fluent in Arabic, English, and Persian.Rodway, Nick (26 August 2017). \\"Man of peace \\". The Spectator. Retrieved 28 July 2018. ==Views== Tawhidi had earlier held Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi as his marja taqlid -- a religious leader whose authority one follows in life. But since 2015, Tawhidi has stated that he does not subscribe to any particular religious leader. There have been marked differences between his and Shiraji's views on a host of issues. Tawhidi is president of the Islamic Association of South Australia, which he founded in 2016. He refers to himself as the \\"Imam of Peace\\".  Islam  Tawhidi believes that Islam must be reformed in order to survive. He deems all acts of terrorism to be condemned in the Quran, and had denounced ISIL as an extremist body that did not represent the religion; in June 2017, after the jihadi terrorist attack in London, he described the branch as a \\"cancer\\" on the religion. He has been also critical of the treatment of women in Islamic countries, has called for the appointment of women to the Australian National Imams Council and rejected the use of hijab in public. Tawhidi also oppose Muslims justifying domestic violence, polygamy and the killing of apostates. He supports limiting the building of mosques, has urged for bans of Islamic texts, particularly the Sahih al-Bukhari, in that they have been used as an ideological underpinning for acts of terrorism, advocates for the deportation of radical Islamic leaders from Australia and supports a temporary travel-ban on Muslims coming from the Middle East to Australia. Tawhidi has claimed of halal certification to threaten the Australian way of life, and was one of the most vocal advocates for shutting down of Islamic schools in entirety, or radically reforming them, for security reasons. After making these comments, Tawhidi claimed he had been \\"escorted into hiding by the police\\" for fear of retribution by the Muslim community. However, a police spokesperson told The Australian that \\"there have been no incidents relating to the removal of a person from a mosque or similar place.\\"  Political views  During August 2019, upon India revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, he said of Kashmir to be a Hindu land which was rightfully claimed by India, and further argued that both Pakistan and Kashmir belonged to India, since it was older than Islam. ==Media attention== In March 2016, Tawhidi released a statement concerning a man who was released on bail after allegedly grabbing a woman's headscarf on a bus in Adelaide. He stated: \\"If government laws do not prevent such assaults, then I fear that a day will come where the Muslim community might take matters into their own hands to protect their women and mothers.\\" His statement also said that the Australian Government should review its laws on female headscarves. Tawhidi later clarified that his statement was not meant to be interpreted as a threat, and he was unhappy with how his comments were portrayed by the ABC and Daily Mail Australia. He said that the misinterpretation by media outlets inspired him to found the \\"Imams for Peace\\" organisation. Later in 2016, he attended the World Alliance of Religions for Peace (WARP) Summit in South Korea, hosted by Lee Man-hee. The WARP Summit coincided with the birthday of Lee Man-hee. Tawhidi was supportive of the event and was quoted as saying \\"this WARP Summit is an event blessed by God because it is every religious person's wish to achieve peace through an alliance into one religion.\\" In February 2017, Tawhidi caused controversy when he appeared on an episode of Australian current affairs program Today Tonight. During the episode, he suggested that Islamic extremists were conspiring to set up a caliphate in Australia. He also made claims that these extremists planned to increase the Muslim population in Australia and rename streets after Islamic terrorists. Tawhidi called for a government body to be established in order to investigate the Muslim community. In the same month, Tawhidi made a request to defend former Jakarta Governor Ahok during his blasphemy trial. He argued that the aggrieved Islamic groups had incorrectly interpreted the verse of the Quran that Ahok had allegedly referenced in a blasphemous manner. Tawhidi stated that there is nothing wrong with non- Muslims leading a Muslim-majority country. Tawhidi said he has received death threats from Indonesia's Islamic Defenders Front. Tawhidi previously had his arrival to Indonesia rejected, in October 2015, after he was considered to have insulted the Sunni-majority nation by calling it \\"Indoneshia\\". Islamic organisation Hidayatullah described Tawhidi as \\"an extreme Shia.\\" A statement from DPP ABI, an Indonesian Shia organisation, said Tawhidi was suspected of being a \\"takfiri\\" and they rejected his presence in Indonesia. The statement went on to say that Tawhidi's presence would undermine efforts to \\"achieve unity of the Muslims in the face of Zionism.\\" In May 2017, Tawhidi appeared as a guest on Australian breakfast television program Sunrise to discuss the recent Manchester Arena bombing. He claimed many young Muslims were being pushed to believe killing infidels would allow them to gain paradise and that the Manchester bomber would have believed he would go to heaven for what he did. He is also a fan of Indian actress Raveena Tandon; some of his tweets about her were compiled in a viral Twitter thread in 2019. In 2019 he was the first Shia Imam to \\"pay respects at Auschwitz\\" concentration camp. ==Reception== Bronwyn Adcock, writing for the ABC, said Tawhidi had very few supporters in the Muslim community.  Sectarianism  Zuhdi Jasser, writing an op-ed for Asia Times Online, said that Tawhidi only criticised Sunni Islamists and never Islamists within his own community such as the Iran regime; in essence, he was not a reformist but a Shia radical. Chloe Patton, in a piece for the ABC, referred to Tawhidi as a \\"Shia extremist\\" and accused him of waging a \\"sectarian war against Australia's majority Sunni community.\\" Patton referred to Tawhidi's comments to Andrew Bolt that Sahih al-Bukhari, a sacred Sunni text, should be banned. Paul Barry, presenter of Media Watch, made mention of Tawhidi's calling sacred Sunni texts \\"monkey teachings\\", and described Sunnis as \\"followers of an alcoholic, rapist caliph.\\"  Islamic credentials  Tawhidi's claims of being an ordained Sheikh, has been rejected. The Sunni-based Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) does not recognise Tawhidi as an imam, sheikh or Muslim leader.  Far right  Tawhidi has been accused of being an ally of Australian far-right groups including the Australian Liberty Alliance as well as One Nation. Tawhidi had defended One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and supported her stances. ==NotesReferences External links == * *@Imamofpeace Twitter Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Living people Category:21st-century imams Category:Australian imams Category:Australian people of Iraqi descent Category:Australian Shia Muslims Category:Critics of Islamism Category:Critics of Sunni Islam Category:Iranian emigrants to Australia Category:Iranian imams Category:Muslim reformers Category:Muslim supporters of Israel Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Iranian people of Iraqi descent Category:Critics of Wahhabism ","title":"Mohammad Tawhidi"},{"id":"54264070","text":"Louis G√©rardin (12 August 1912 in Boulogne-Billancourt ‚Äì 23 May 1982 in Paris) was a French track cyclist.

She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 2002 when she won both of her races by clear margins. In the following spring she finished second in the Athasi Stakes and then returned from a lengthy absence to record her biggest win when she defeated a strong field to win the Irish Oaks. She was well beaten in her last two races and was retired from racing at the end of the season. As a broodmare she has produced several minor winners. ==Background== Vintage Tipple is a bay mare with a small white star bred in Ireland by Edmund Loder at the family's Eyresfield Stud near the Curragh in County Kildare. In February 2002 the two-year-old filly was put up for auction at Goffs and was sold for ‚Ç¨16,500. She entered the ownership of Patrick J O'Donovan and was sent into training with the veteran Paddy Mullins at Goresbridge, County Kilkenny. She was one of the best horses sired by Entrepreneur who won the 2000 Guineas in 1997. He was not a success as a breeding stallion and was exported to Japan in 2002. Her dam Overruled showed some racing ability, winning minor races at Doncaster in 1995 and Chepstow in 1996. Her dam Overcall was a granddaughter of Melodramatic, whose other descendants have included Vintage Crop. ==Racing career== 2002: two-year- old season Vintage Tipple was ridden in both of her races as a two-year-old by Johnny Murtagh. She made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile at Tralee Racecourse on 27 August and started at odds of 11/2 in a seventeen-runner field. After being restrained at the rear of the field she made rapid progress in the straight, took the lead a furlong from the finish, and drew clear to win by three lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Solas Mo Chroi. On 14 September the filly was dropped in distance for a minor stakes race over seven furlongs at the Curragh and started 5/4 favourite against five opponents. She started slowly but took the lead a furlong out and accelerated away from her rivals to win by four lengths in \\"impressive\\" style. 2003: three-year-old season Vintage Tipple was ridden by Jamie Spencer when she began her second season in the Group 3 Athasi Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh. Starting at odds of 5/2 she kept on well in the closing stages to finish second, two lengths behind the Round Tower Stakes-winner Walayef. After the race she was found to have sustained a hairline fracture to her cannon bone. The filly was off the track for two and a half months before being moved up in class and distance for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 13 July. The eleven-runner field appeared to be a strong one with Yesterday starting favourite ahead of Spanish Sun (Ribblesdale Stakes), Ocean Silk (Lupe Stakes), Casual Look, and Snippets (Noblesse Stakes), with Vintage Tipple next in the betting on 12/1 alongside Hanami (Pretty Polly Stakes). The outsider L'Ancresse set the pace with Vintage Tipple, ridden by Frankie Dettori tracking the leaders and turning into the straight in fifth place. She made steady progress in the last quarter mile, overtook L'Ancresse inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths with Casual Look a head away in third and Yesterday in fourth place. After the race Dettori said \\"the further she went, the stronger she got. When I turned round a furlong out I couldn't believe we would win so easily\\". Her 84-year old trainer commented \\"she's a very good filly\\", the trainer said. \\"She just had the one hiccough, but she came through it well. If she stays lucky, the sky's the limit for her\\". On 6 September Vintage Tipple was matched against male opposition in the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown. Ridden by Pat Smullen she never looked likely to win and finished last of the seven runners, more than thirty lengths behind the winner High Chaparral. On her final start she was dropped back to Listed class for the Finale Stakes at the Curragh in October, but failed to reproduce her summer form and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind L'Ancresse. ==Breeding record== After her retirement from racing Vintage Tipple became a broodmare for her owner Pat O'Donovan. She has produced at least nine foals and four winners: *Pearl Trader, a chestnut filly, foaled in 2005, sired by Dubai Destination. Failed to win in five races. *Cape Vintage, bay filly, 2006, by Cape Cross. Won two races. *Kings Vintage, bay filly, 2007, by King's Best.

The Hill also released a preliminary single without Farlowe. Though The Hill existed for only a brief period, its members had (or, in certain cases, went on to have) significant careers on their own. ==Background== During the 1960s, bassist Bruce \\"Bugs\\" Waddell was a member of The Thunderbirds, Chris Farlowe's backing band (along with Dave Greenslade and Carl Palmer). He was involved in Farlowe's career as early as 1965, when Farlowe recorded \\"Stormy Monday Blues\\" under the name Little Joe Cook. By 1969, Farlowe's label, Immediate Records, was on the verge of dissolution. Around that time, Waddell formed a group with guitarist Steve Hammond (with whom he had co-written a single, \\"Dawn,\\" for Farlowe), keyboardist Peter Robinson (who had been in Episode Six with Ian Gillan), cellist Paul Buckmaster (who had performed on David Bowie's \\"Space Oddity\\"), and drummer Colin Davey. It was this line-up of musicians that was called The Hill. ==From Here to Mama Rosa and single releases== In 1969, The Hill recorded a promo single, \\"Sylvie\\" b/w \\"The Fourth Annual Convention of the Battery Hen Farmers Association Part II,\\" which was the last single released by Immediate Records. Shortly thereafter, the group set about writing and recording songs for a full-length album to be released on Polydor. Sensing that none among them had suitable singing skills, the band arranged for Farlowe to join them, since he had recently completed a nine-month tour of the United States and was available to contribute his vocals. Stuart Mackay was brought in to produce the album and write the liner notes; he also assisted with the songwriting on a few tracks. Track listing From Here to Mama Rosa was released in September 1970 on Polydor. Three singles resulted from the album sessions and were released that same year on Polydor: * ‚ÄúBlack Sheep‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúFifty Years‚Äù (The A-side was given its full title in this context, with ‚ÄúBlack Sheep Of The Family‚Äù printed on the label) * ‚ÄúPut Out The Light‚Äù b/w ‚ÄúQuestions‚Äù (The A-side was a cover of a track by Ray Pohlman) * \\"Mama Rosa\\" b/w \\"Questions\\" ==Legacy== Despite their brief existence as a band, The Hill left behind a catalogue of tracks that would be covered by a number of other artists. Furthermore, the members of The Hill would go on to enjoy prolific careers of their own. Peter Robinson joined Quatermass, who recorded a version of \\"Black Sheep of the Family\\" for their self-titled 1970 album. Robinson went on to work with bands and artists such as Bryan Ferry, Brand X, and Phil Collins. He also composed soundtracks for films such as The World's Fastest Indian and Blind Fury, among many others. Paul Buckmaster contributed cello to the first Quatermass album and went on to great success as an arranger for artists such as Elton John, The Rolling Stones, and Train, for whose song \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" he won a Grammy for Best Arranger Accompanying Vocal. Steve Hammond joined Fat Mattress, with whom he recorded a version of \\"Black Sheep of the Family\\" that was released as the B-side to the single \\"Highway.\\" Afterward, he worked for many years as a songwriter and session guitarist for other artists. He also composed the music for a sci-fi themed rock musical titled Flash Fearless Versus The Zorg Women Parts 5 & 6, which was released in 1975 and featured guest appearances by several singers and musicians of note, such as Alice Cooper, Eddie Jobson, John Entwistle, Keith Moon, Justin Hayward, Bill Bruford, and Jim Dandy, among others. Colin Davey went on to play drums for Ronnie Lane (of the Small Faces) in Slim Chance. Chris Farlowe joined Colosseum after Mama Rosa was released, and later joined Atomic Rooster. A wide variety of artists recorded cover versions of songs by The Hill. Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow recorded \\"Black Sheep of the Family\\" for their 1975 debut album, and Al Atkins (formerly of Judas Priest) featured his own version of the song on his 1998 album Victim of Changes. Additionally, Italian singer Al Bano recorded a version of \\"Mama Rosa,\\" modified with Italian lyrics, for his 1971 album 1972 (On the label, it is spelled \\"Mamma Rosa\\"); he also released it as a single. Charles Hilton Brown also covered this track. An Italian group called The Orbit covered \\"Questions,\\" and yet another Italian band, I Nomadi, adapted \\"Winter of My Life\\" (under the title \\"Icaro\\") for their 1973 album Un Giorno Insieme. ==See also== * List of Polydor Records artists * 1969 in music ==References== Category:Polydor Records artists Category:British rock music groups Category:English rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1969 ","title":"The Hill (band)"},{"id":"54264184","text":"Age of Anger: A History of the Present is a 2017 nonfiction book by Indian author Pankaj Mishra. Mishra accounts for the resurgence of reactionary and right-wing political movements in the late 2010s. He argues that nationalist, isolationist, and chauvinist movements, ranging from terror groups such as ISIS to political movements such as Brexit, have emerged in response to the globalization and normalization of Western ideals such as individualism, capitalism, and secularism. ==Thesis== Mishra notes that disorder and violence naturally accompanied the coming of industrial capitalism in the Western world, citing events such as the French Revolution, the Revolutions of 1848, and two World Wars. He argues that the rest of world is now undergoing that same series of shocks, and that new tensions resulting from the Enlightenment are not yet resolved even in Europe. He criticizes the view that early twentieth-century strife was an aberration interrupting a long history of steady progress and increasing prosperity, instead arguing that the disorder is endemic to modernity. In the first half of the book Mishra dwells on the dispute between philosophers Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who lived during the eighteenth century when Enlightenment ideals and economic, political, and social liberalism began gaining momentum in Europe. According to Mishra, Rousseau was among those who best anticipated the problems modernity would bring: rootlessness, competition, and materialism. Mishra presents this theory in opposition to historical theories that tacitly ascribe mostly positive attributes to modern liberalism such as Fukuyama's The End of History, which argues that liberal democracy has irrevocably become a global ideal, and Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, which Mishra argues encourages Islamophobia while obscuring the true causes of religious terrorism. ==Reception== Critics praised the book's erudition, noting Mishra's ambitious and timely argument relying on thinkers both well-known and obscure. Slate's Laura Miller stated, \\"The middle of the book could be heavy sledding for anyone lacking a passing familiarity with figures such as Fichte, Bakunin, and Kropotkin, but the chapters on how these European writers affected subsequent generations of leaders in India, Turkey, and China make it worth the effort.\\"Miller, Laura (2017-01-25). \\"Age of Anger: What America‚Äôs violent transition to modernity has in common with the rise of Islamic extremism.\\" Slate.com.

She was also known as Huang Zhangding and Huang Shuyi. ==Early career== She was born as Huang Dinghui in Liuyang, Hunan, Qing dynasty. Her parents supported emancipation for women. For example, they made the decision not to have her feet bound, an unusual choice among educated people living near them, and sent her to a local women's school at the age of twelve. At the age of 18 she escaped an arranged marriage and arrived in Hankou, Hubei, where she joined women's campaigns and one year later was elected president of the city's women's department. In 1926, after joining the Communist Party, she changed her name to \\"Huang Mulan,\\" expressing admiration for legendary woman warrior Hua Mulan. In 1927 the First United Front fell apart and a purge of communists related to the party began. Huang went underground along with her husband, Wan Xiyan. Wan died in 1928, a few months after the couple's son was born. Following her husband's death, Huang sent her son to her in-laws and began taking up tasks again. Huang is credited with saving China's first premier Zhou Enlai from kidnappers in 1930, based on information she learned from the Kuomintang. She was the person who alerted the Communist leadership to the defection of the party's General Secretary Xiang Zhongfa and, thanks to her alarm, heavy losses were avoided. ==Later life== Huang Mulan was twice imprisoned and spent 17 years in prison from the 1950s to 1975. Following her release, Huang kept filing lawsuits to clear her name. In 1980, with the support of Zhou Enlai's widow Deng Yingchao, her achievements were confirmed by the CPC. She was married four times and her stories have been captured in several books, films and TV drama series. An autobiography was released in 2012. Huang spent her final three years at the Zhejiang hospital in Hangzhou, China living under her birthname \\"Huang Dinghui.\\" She died on February 7, 2017, aged 110 years. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Chinese supercentenarians Category:Women supercentenarians Category:People from Liuyang Category:Chinese spies ","title":"Huang Mulan"},{"id":"54264301","text":"Ivane-Qvarqvare Jaqeli-Tsikhisjvareli (; died ) was a Georgian nobleman of the Jaqeli family, who served as eristavi (\\"duke\\") and spasalar (\\"constable\\") of Samtskhe in the early 13th century. Rising to prominence thanks to his loyal service to Queen-Regnant Tamar of Georgia, Ivane Jaqeli's long career spanned pivotal years in the history of medieval Georgia, through the \\"Golden Age\\" to the crisis and decline under the Mongol hegemony. Ivane, otherwise known as Qvarqvare, first appears in the medieval Georgian chronicles as bearing the surname Tsikhisjvareli, derived from the territorial epithet \\"of Tsikhisjvari\\". During a revolt of Queen Tamar's disgraced husband, George the Rus', around 1191, Ivane was one of the few nobles of Samtskhe who remained loyal to the queen. He might have become duke and constable of Samtskhe after the previous occupant of these offices, Botso Jaqeli, fell out of favor with Tamar for having supported George's attempted coup. Ivane was Botso's kinsman, member of the family cognate with that of Botso, or even his brother. By 1220, under Tamar's successor, George IV Lasha, Ivane, in addition to his tenure in Samtskhe, was also mechurchlet-ukhutsesi (\\"Lord High Treasurer\\") at the Georgian court. When the Mongol armies moved in for the final conquest of Georgia in 1236, Ivane offered them stiff resistance and fought on until Queen Rusudan consented to a truce, in contrast to most Georgian grandees, who either surrendered without fighting or fled the Mongol advance to safer areas. The queen herself had escaped to western Georgia and did not return to the capital until being convinced to do so by the leading nobles of the kingdom, Ivane included, around 1243. After Rusudan's death in 1245, while the Georgians were waiting for her successor to be confirmed by the Mongol Great Khan, the Mongols divided Georgia into several administrative units, tumens, run by local aristocracy. It is not known whether Ivane was at the head of any of these tumens, but during this period of interregnum he was the one whom the nobles of Georgia's southwestern marches, such as Tao, Klarjeti, Kola, and Artaani, solicited support against the invading Anatolian Turks. At the head of 10,000 troops, Ivane won a victory at the Avni plain and sent his grandsons‚ÄîIvane-Papa and Sargis‚Äîto chase the retreating Turks beyond the Georgian borders and seize Oltu, which was probably under Ayyubid control at this point. Further conquests are mentioned by the Arabic chronicler Baybars al-Mansuri, who states that the Georgians, apparently meaning the Jaqeli, profited from the Mongol invasion of Anatolia to take hold of Babrawan (Georgian Marmovani, modern Narman, south of Oltu), Washlawan (Georgian Vashlovani, of unknown location in Tao), and Bayburt. Shortly afterwards, Ivane participated in a failed plot to overthrow the Mongol hegemony. In 1247, Ivane was among those nobles, who, alarmed by a protracted interregnum, sought out and brought back to Georgia the exiled prince David, son of the late king George IV. Ivane-Qvarqvare might have died around that time, outliving his son Beka, who was killed in a battle with the Mongols in 1220 or 1221, and, possibly, the eldest grandson Ivane (also known as Papa). The next known duke of Samtskhe was Ivane-Qvarqvare's younger grandson, Sargis Jaqeli. == Notes  References == * * * Ivane 01 Category:12th-century people from Georgia (country) Category:13th-century people from Georgia (country) Category:1240s deaths ","title":"Ivane I Jaqeli"},{"id":"54264314","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 season was Galatasarays 114th in existence and 60th consecutive season in the S√ºper Lig.

He stated that ODS was de facto victor of the election. He stated that voters appreciated successes of the previous council. He was also glad that he received highest number of votes of all candidates. Pavel ≈†r√°mek also considered the result a success. He stated that \\"History never asks how much you win but if you win. Both strongest parties, ODS and ANO 2011 expressed intention to negotiate with all other parties with exception of Communists. Leader of Social Democrats Martin Zrzaveck√Ω admitted disappointment with the election. \\"None of us expected ODS to be that successful and we are third and can't be satisfied as we should be. Zrzaveck√Ω expressed will to negotiate with ANO 2011 and ODS. Coalition formation Coalition talks started soon after the election.

Civic Democratic Party formed Council with Czech Social Democratic Party, Christian and Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party and Citizens Patriots. Coalition has majority of 27 seats. Social Democrat Zrzaveck√Ω became the mayor while Civic Democratic leader Baxa became deputy Mayor. Council consists of 4 Civic Democrats, 3 Social Democrats, 1 Christian Democrat and 1 Citizen Patriot.

The Duckwall Family moved to Greenleaf, Kansas in 1898, where A.L. opened and operated a repair shop for sewing machines and bicycles. Duckwall sold the Grenleaf shop, and in 1901, purchased a variety store in nearby Abilene, which offered for sale small items needed around the home. Joined by his brother, Wilbur, they called the store \\"Duckwall Bros. RACKET STORE - A Little of Everything.\\" ==A Chain of Duckwall's stores== After the Abilene store, a second variety store was opened in nearby Salina in 1906, and managed by Wilbur. Other Duckwall's stores were opened in Central Kansas, in the cities of Manhattan, Clay Center (1910), Concordia (1911), Junction City, and Great Bend (1914). By 1915, a corporation was formed by the name of \\"The A.L. Duckwall Stores Company\\", with A.L. as President and General Manager. Duckwall's variety store photographed in Brush, Colorado, in 1991. ==ALCO Stores== Though A.L. Duckwall would not live to see it, The A.L. Duckwall Stores Company began to venture away from the limited five and dime variety store and into the discount retail business. The first ALCO stores were opened in 1968 to provide a full selection of merchandise. The corporation, still based in Abilene, Kansas, eventually became ALCO Stores, Inc., but would continue to operate both ALCO and Duckwall's stores. As of June 2008, the corporation operated 205 ALCO stores and 59 Duckwall's stores. A second bankruptcy for ALCO Stores, Inc. in 2014 led to the closure of all stores by this time. An ALCO store that was closed April 29, 2013 in Vermilion, Ohio. ==Personal life== A.L. Duckwall had married Retta White in 1904, and had three children: daughters Doris and Donna, and son Junior. Over his life, Duckwall belonged to the Lutheran Church, Rotary Club, Knights Templars, Shrines, and Democratic Party. Death Duckwall died of a heart attack in his office in 1937. He was laid to rest at Abilene Cemetery. At the time of his death, Duckwall had built over 40 variety stores in Kansas and Colorado. ==Legacy== In 2000, Duckwall was inducted into the Kansas Business Hall of Fame as recipient of the Historical Honors Award from Emporia State University School of Business. Daughter-in-law Aileen Duckwall accepted the award from Kansas Governor Bill Graves.

The first facility Johnson County built to care for paupers and the mentally ill was a four-room cabin in 1855. Two wings were added to the original building six years later. All that remains of this structure is this wing that housed the mentally ill. with The single-story wood frame structure with a gable roof was used by the county for this purpose until 1886 when a new facility was completed. It was initially thought that it was built in 1859, but later research revealed that it was built in 1861 and that it was moved a short distance to this location in 1888.

The rivalry between these two schools, located about apart, dates to their first men's college basketball game in 1921, and has continued across all sports, with the football series gaining attention as well, having started in 1929. Both universities share common characteristics, both being over 200 year old institutions in urban settings. The schools have also shared conferences historically, with the rivalry stretching over the span of four conferences from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference to Conference USA, and more recently in the Big East Conference, which in 2013 was renamed to the American Athletic Conference. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, Louisville joined the Atlantic Coast Conference and since then the rivalry has been put on hiatus in football and basketball. However, many other sports at the universities, such as baseball, continue to battle periodically. On April 30th, 2019 John Brannen and Chris Mack exchanged tweets announcing a renewal of the Cincinnati‚ÄìLouisville rivalry with the first game at Fifth Third Arena on November 13th, 2020.

Center } Both universities have traced parallel paths, from their early foundation in the early nineteenth century as municipal universities to their later growth into state sponsored institutions in the 1960s and 70s. Due to their close proximity, the universities became early athletic opponents as college athletics developed first facing off in 1921 in a men's college basketball game. Additionally, this proximity led to both schools being members of the Missouri Valley Conference, Metro Conference, Conference USA, and the Big East Conference historically. While the rivalry was represented annually in Football from 1966‚Äì1992 and 1996‚Äì2013, the true intensity of the rivalry was felt on the basketball court. Legendary coaches Denny Crum, Bob Huggins, and Rick Pitino each played their part in famous wins for each program and fanning the flames of the matchup. In the last year of the rivalry in football and basketball for the foreseeable future, the contests lived up to the pressure. In the battle for The Keg of Nails, Teddy Bridgewater led the No. 19 Cardinals to an overtime comeback at Nippert Stadium much to the ire of the Bearcat faithful. On the hardwood both teams would claim upset, ranked wins at their opponent's home court. Sean Kilpatrick lead the Bearcats to a 69‚Äì66 victory at the KFC Yum! Center while Russ Smith and the Cardinals would beat the Bearcats 58‚Äì57 at Fifth Third Arena in their last matchup as conference foes.

Produced by Ram Achanta, Gopichand Achanta and Anil Sunkara under their 14 Reels Entertainment, LIE features Nithiin and Megha Akash in the lead roles while Arjun Sarja plays the antagonist. Music is composed by Mani Sharma while J. Yuvaraj handled the cinematography. The film released worldwide on 11 August 2017 . ==Plot== The story starts off with a police informer calling up Bharadwaj (Ravi Kishan) with information on criminal Padmanabham (Arjun Sarja) saying that Padmanabham is at a bar wearing a suit. Bharadwaj along with a few police officers enter the bar. A man holds a waitress there at gunpoint and Bharadwaj shoots him allowing the waitress to leave. A. Sathyam (Nithiin) is a good-for-nothing son of a widowed mother (Poornima). He is unemployed and lives off of his father's monthly pension. He is unmarried and fantasizes about marrying an American girl. By a quirk of fate, Sathyam, along with a stranger named Chaitra (Megha Akash), who has a dream to win a lot of money, end up in Las Vegas, where they decide to only lie with one another. Shortly after, they start to fall in love with one another through their beautiful lies. At the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a frustrated officer named Bharadwaj (Ravi Kishan) is desperate to nab an elusive criminal named Padmanabham (Arjun Sarja), who has escaped the long arm of the law for 19 years. Padmanabham is a famous Indian ropewalker and magician, but he is also a master of disguise. Thus, the NIA has no idea what Padmanabham looks like. He is now suspected to be residing in the USA. Bharadwaj has drafted a sharp officer named Aadi (Sriram) to discover Padmanabham's hideout and identity by following a suit which he has purchased and is assumed to have an obsession with. The operation of this mission is called Sholay, implying that Aadi is the showman. All along, Padmanabham tries to go after the team, which is trying to trace him, only to end up with Sathyam. Sathyam was a part of this operation the whole time. The rest of the film is about how Sathyam is related to the entire operation floated to crack Padmanabham, and how the hero-villain duo and other characters race against time. In the end, Sathyam kills Padmanabham for good. ==Cast== *Nithiin as A.

As an entrepreneur he also held public offices. He was the first president of the City Council of Schaffhausen. He was the founder of Georg Fischer AG. ==Biography== Johann Conrad Fischer was born on 14 September 1773 as son of the entrepreneur Johann Conrad Fischer in Schaffhausen.Adrian Knoepfli. Vier Generationen Fischer Schaffhausen: Mit Eisen- und Stahlguss zum Erfolg. Naefels: Verein fuer wirtschaftshistorische Studien, 2001. After attending the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen, he learned the trades of coppersmith and fire pump maker in his father's company. Between 1792 and 1794 he travelled through Germany, Scandinavia and England. After his return to Switzerland in 1794 he took over the management of the family business in 1797. In 1802 he purchased several former mills in Muehlental (SH) section of the Merishausertal on the northern outskirts of Schaffhausen and set up a small foundry for the production of cast iron bells and fire pump engines. In 1806, as the first on continental Europe, he began to cast steel. Once the Continental Blockade was lifted in 1814, Fischer undertook a study trip to England and subsequently published his experiences in a travel journal. In particular he was critical of the economic upheavals he observed in the Midlands, the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. He continued to travel through England, Austria, Germany and France. In France he was invited by the Ministry of the Interior to set up a business there. He began to experiment with the addition of alloys to cast steel. In 1807 he cast steel with manganese, in 1814 he mixed so-called yellow steel with cooper, in 1819 with silver, and in 1823 with chromium. In 1827 he successfully created a cast iron which could be employed as malleable iron and obtained a patent in Austria for this invention. His last alloyed cast iron consisted to one-third part of copper, which he named Fischer-Metall. This would be useful much later for railroad axials. ==Family== In 1797 Johann Conrad Fischer married Catharina von Waldkirch and they had three sons who carried on their father's work: *Georg Fischer (1804-1888) *Berthold Fischer (1807-1879) *Wilhelm Fischer (1803-1882) Johann Conrad Fischer died in Schaffhausen at the age of 81. His grandson Georg Fischer II (1834-1887) and great-grandson George Fischer III (1864-1925) continued to expand the family business until the beginning of the 20th century. ==Fischer as Entrepreneur and Civic Leader== Fischer was more active as an inventor than as manufacturer and businessman. In 1819 he supported the establishment of a steel factory near Montbeliard in eastern France. He held license agreements with manufacturing companies in London and Luettich. Due to its favorable legal conditions, he patented nearly all his inventions in Austria. Furthermore he set up three steel foundries in Austria which were managed by his sons: 1827 in Hainfeld, 1833 in Traisen and 1839 in Salzburg. Johann Conrad Fischer held several public offices in Schaffhausen beginning in 1797. His opinion was often sought by newspapers and journalists in matters related to railroads, coinage, import and export taxation, as well as constitutional matters. He maintained regular correspondence with many friends not only in Switzerland, but also in numerous other European countries. Fischer is regarded as one of the leading public figures of Schaffhausen in the 19th century. ==Further reading== *The Metallurgist Johann Conrad Fischer 1773-1854, and His Relations with Britain.

The remaining buildings and structures are agricultural in nature, and were built from the late 19th-century to the early 20th-century. The original facility to care for the poor and mentally ill was built in 1855 (no longer extant) and wings were added around 1861. The remaining wing of the first asylum building was moved to its present location in 1888 and used as a hog building after a new residential building had been completed two years prior. That later building is no longer extant and Chatham Oaks, a mental health facility, was built on that site in 1964. The second contributing site, apart from the location of the agricultural buildings, is where the cemetery for this facility is believed to be located.

He is best known for the 1974 zombie cult film The Corpse Eaters. ==Life and death== Little is known about the man and even less about his films. With savings from his work as a miner at Inco (now Vale Limited), Zazelenchuk purchased the now defunct 69 Drive-In in Sudbury. He financed, wrote, produced, directed and did special makeup effects for a handful of short horror movies photographed on 16mm film with such titles as Attack of the Brain Demons, Revenge of the Mummy, and Jami (1969), which received an Honorable Mention from the Photographic Society of America's Ten Best of 1969. After the completion of his feature The Corpse Eaters, he sold his drive-in and bought a hotel in Florida before drinking himself to death at the early age of 36. Today, he is considered by many to be a Canadian Herschell Gordon Lewis. ==The Corpse Eaters== According to Caelum Vatnsdal's book They Came from Within, The Corpse Eaters was produced in 1973 by a teenaged Zazelenchuk with a meagre budget of $36,000 culled from the proceeds of his drive-in. Because his first and only feature film had such a small budget, Zazelenchuk couldn‚Äôt afford his ideal star, John Carradine. Instead, Zazelenchuk brought local bums and high school friends together to make what is essentially Canada‚Äôs first gore film. Zazelenchuk financed, wrote and produced the film. He is also credited with the special makeup effects. He left the direction to Donald R. Passmore, who was soon replaced with Klaus Vetter, who also served as the film's cinematographer. On August 16, 1974, at the 69 Drive-In, The Corpse Eaters premiered in Greater Sudbury. A successful local run followed before Zazalenchuk was offered $5,000 for distribution rights from distributor Howard Mahler under his banner Howard Mahler Films. The distributor, however, did not inform Zazelenchuk that he was purchasing the film without any intent on releasing it. It was used as a tax write off, and declared as a loss. The film was never released theatrically elsewhere. The film faded into obscurity for years until Encore Home Video released it on DVD in 1993, claiming to have transferred their copy from the only known surviving print. This version runs 57 minutes, and is considered incomplete, making it a partially lost film. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Lawrence Zazelenchuk at the Internet Movie Database Category:Film directors from Ontario Category:Canadian screenwriters Category:Canadian film producers Category:Writers from Greater Sudbury Category:Canadian people of Ukrainian descent ","title":"Lawrence Zazelenchuk"},{"id":"54265092","text":"Estradiol sulfamate (E2MATE; developmental code names J995, PGL-2, PGL-2001, ZK-190628, others), or estradiol-3-O-sulfamate, is a steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitor which is under development for the treatment of endometriosis.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800026648 It is the C3 sulfamate ester of estradiol, and was originally thought to be a prodrug of estradiol. The drug was first synthesized as an STS inhibitor along with its oxidized version estrone 3-O-sulfamate (EMATE) in the group of Professor Barry V L Potter at the University of Bath, UK, working together with Professor Michael J Reed at Imperial College, London and was found to be highly estrogenic in rodents. Such aryl sulfamate esters were shown to be \\"first-in- class\\" highly potent active site-directed irreversible STS inhibitors. Compounds of this class are thought to irreversibly modify the active site formylglycine residue of STS. The drug shows profoundly reduced susceptibility to first-pass metabolism relative to estradiol, and was believed to be the first \\"potent\\" estradiol prodrug to be discovered. It was clinically investigated for possible use as an estrogen for indications like hormonal contraception and menopausal hormone therapy. However, it showed no estrogenic effects in women. The potent non-estrogenic clinical STS inhibitor Irosustat (STX64/667-Coumate) was used to explore the possibility that STS might be responsible for the hydrolysis of estrogen sulphamates. Results demonstrated convincingly that STS is the enzyme responsible for the removal of the sulfamoyl group from estrogen sulfamates and has a crucial role in regulating the estrogenicity associated with this class of drug. Thus, STS inhibition blocks the conversion of E2MATE into estradiol and thereby abolishes its estrogenicity in humans. Irosustat has completed a number of clinical trials in oncology as an STS inhibitor currently up to Phase II . STS inhibition was also found to be a potential new therapy for endometriosis. Following this, E2MATE was repurposed as an STS inhibitor for the treatment of estrogen- dependent conditions like endometriosis. As of 2017, E2MATE is in phase II clinical trials for endometriosis. Unlike estradiol and other estradiol esters, due to its unique sulfamate ester, E2MATE is not hydrolyzed during the first pass with oral administration, and instead can only be cleaved into estradiol systemically. E2MATE itself shows no affinity for the estrogen receptor or estrogenic activity in vitro, requiring hydrolysis into estradiol for estrogenicity. In accordance, the systemic potency of oral E2MATE as an estrogen in rodents was found to be increased approximately 100-fold relative to that of oral estradiol, whereas its hepatotropic activity is increased only marginally, by about 2- to 3-fold. As such, E2MATE has virtually absent effects on estrogen-modulated liver functions with oral administration at typical dosages equivalent to those of estradiol and behaves much like parenterally or transdermally administered estradiol, thereby combining the advantages of transdermal estradiol with the convenience of oral administration. It has been determined that this is due to binding of E2MATE to carbonic anhydrase II in erythrocytes (red blood cells), which results in E2MATE being rapidly taken up into erythrocytes from the blood of the hepatic portal vein and bypassing the liver during the first pass with oral administration. Following this, E2MATE is slowly released from erythrocytes into the circulation. The X-ray crystal structure of EMATE in complex with carbonic anhydrase II has been determined. However, it has been found that E2MATE, without being hydrolyzed first, can be converted by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into estrone sulfamate (EMATE), analogously to the conversion of estradiol into estrone. Moreover, EMATE is the dominant fraction found in the circulation, and EMATE is an extremely potent STS inhibitor. As a result, EMATE prevents the bioactivation of itself and E2MATE into estrone and estradiol, respectively, which effectively abolishes their estrogenic activity in humans. In relation to these findings, according to Elger and colleagues, \\"In spite of high levels of [E2MATE] and EMATE in the circulation, only insignificant [estradiol] levels and no estrogenic effects were generated in humans. [...] Further, EMATE is a potent inhibitor of the STS. It is obvious from estrogenicity studies that this property impairs the release of estrone and [estradiol] in a species varied manner. STS inhibition in the human was probably the mechanism for very long lasting high [E2MATE]- and EMATE concentrations in erythrocytes compared to shorter initial peak values of [estrone] and [estradiol] in the plasma.\\" As such, E2MATE and EMATE are not effective as estrogens in humans, and the researchers have subsequently developed new C17Œ≤ sulfonamide ester prodrugs of estradiol, such as EC508, that cannot be transformed into the corresponding estrone equivalents and are not STS inhibitors. STS is an enzyme that is responsible for the transformation of hormonally inactive steroid sulfates into their hormonally active forms, for instance hydrolysis of estrone sulfate into estrone (which can then be transformed into the more potent estradiol). Inhibition of STS is the basis for the clinical development of E2MATE for endometriosis, as STS is expressed in the endometrium, and the severity of endometriosis has been found to correlate with STS expression. In a clinical study, E2MATE was found to inhibit endometrial STS activity by 91% in premenopausal women, while circulating levels of estradiol were not affected, indicating that E2MATE may have tissue-selective antiestrogenic effects in the endometrium. E2MATE is rapidly and almost completely transformed, by approximately 90%, into EMATE in the intestines during the first pass with oral administration in women. EMATE and E2MATE are almost completely sequestered into erythrocytes from the hepatic portal vein during the first pass with oral administration, thereby bypassing the liver. Treatment with 4 mg oral E2MATE once per week has been found to result in very high maximal levels of E2MATE of 152.1 ng/mL (152,100 pg/mL) and of EMATE of 2,395 ng/mL (2,395,000 pg/mL) in women. Maximal levels of E2MATE and EMATE occur about 3.5 to 5.5 days after a dose of E2MATE. There is a 4.0-fold accumulation of E2MATE and a 3.3-fold accumulation of EMATE with continuous administration of E2MATE relative to a single dose. The biological half-life of E2MATE with continuous administration has been found to be about 18 days and of EMATE about 16 days in women. ==See also== * List of estrogen esters ¬ß Estradiol esters * List of investigational hormonal agents ¬ß Estrogenics * Steroid sulfatase ¬ß Inhibitors ==ReferencesExternal links== * Estradiol sulfamate - AdisInsight * Oestrogen-17-sulphamates as inhibitors of steroid sulphatase (patent) Category:Diols Category:Estradiol esters Category:Prodrugs Category:Steroid sulfatase inhibitors Category:Sulfamate esters ","title":"Estradiol sulfamate"},{"id":"54265097","text":"The men's 1500 metres at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on February 20, 2017 in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  rowspan=3Monday, 20 February 2017  13:39  Heats -  14:43  Semifinals -  15:27  bgcolor=ffffccFinals } ==Results== ;Legend *ADV ‚Äî Advanced *PEN ‚Äî Penalty Heats Heat 1 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:34.056Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:34.179Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:37.238Q - 4 align=left 2:39.924 - 5 align=left 2:48.962 } Heat 2 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:44.094Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:45.227Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:46.725Q - 4 align=left 2:47.061 - 5 align=left 2:59.788 } Heat 3 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:47.202Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:47.403Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 3:05.485Q - 4 align=left 5:18.198 - ‚Äî align=left PEN } Heat 4 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:42.158Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:42.246Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:42.364Q - 4 align=left 2:43.214 - 5 align=left 2:49.967 - 6 align=left No time } Heat 5 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:30.868Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:30.891Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:31.202Q - 4 align=left 2:34.392 - 5 align=left No time - 6 align=left No time } Heat 6 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:31.155Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:31.253Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:36.272Q - 4 align=left 2:40.871 - 5 align=left 2:44.237 - 6 align=left No time } Heat 7 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:36.403Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:36.527Q -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:36.530Q - 4 align=left 2:55.645 - 5 align=left 3:11.470 - ‚Äî align=left PEN } Semifinals Heat 1 { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:19.871QA -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:20.059QA -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:21.105QB -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 4 align=left 2:21.825QB - 5 align=left 2:22.423 - 6 align=left 2:29.791 - 7 align=left 2:43.085 } Heat 2 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:21.830QA -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:21.901QA -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:24.500QB -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 4 align=left 2:29.519QB -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 5 align=left 2:48.665ADVB -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 6 align=left 2:49.851ADVB - ‚Äî align=left PEN } Heat 3 { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 1 align=left 2:24.460QA -bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\" 2 align=left 2:24.507QA -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 3 align=left 2:24.730QB -bgcolor=\\"ffffcc\\" 4 align=left 2:25.195QB - 5 align=left 2:30.481 - 6 align=left 2:38.007 - 7 align=left No time } Finals Final B { class= center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time - 1 align=left 2:23.837 - 2 align=left 2:24.127 - 3 align=left 2:24.233 - 4 align=left 2:24.290 - 5 align=left 2:25.339 - 6 align=left 2:28.679 - 7 align=left 2:33.206 - 8 align=left No time } Final A { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time -  align=left 2:34.056 -  align=left 2:34.265 -  align=left 2:34.356 - 4 align=left 2:34.389 - 5 align=left 2:34.499 - ‚Äî align=left PEN } ==References== *Results summary ==External links== *Official website Men 1500 ","title":"Short track speed skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games ‚Äì Men's 1500 metres"},{"id":"54265100","text":"Alexander Haditaghi (known as Alex Haditaghi) is a Canadian serial entrepreneur and philanthropist. ==Early life== Haditaghi was born in Iran and raised in Turkey.

The event took place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from May 11‚Äì13, 1995, with 50,000 total attendees. Highlights of the 1995 show include Sony's announcement of the PlayStation's release date and pricing, Sega's surprise launch of the Sega Saturn, and Nintendo's showcase of the Virtual Boy console. ==Organization== Prior to 1995, the video game industry used the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) as their primary trade show venue. In the years leading up to 1995, the video game industry was usually delegated to an outdoor section of CES, which were not ideal conditions for promoting products. The International Digital Software Association (IDSA), later renamed to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), approached CES and its head Gary Shapiro with their grievances about the conditions they had at CES. As CES did not consider video games as part of consumer electronics, they were unwilling to alter how they would involve video games. This led IDSA to consider starting their own show. Pat Ferrell of GamePro, a publication owned by International Data Group (IDG) with experience in running trade shows like MacWorld, began the process of organizing such a show. Tom Kalinske, then the CEO of Sega of America, was a prime motivator in establishing a new show, believing CES did not have the video game industry's best interests at heart, and had found previously that running a Sega-only event was highly regarded by retailers and media alike. IDSA also recognized that by holding its own trade show, it would have a means to finance its organization. Ferrell came up with the show's name \\"Electronic Entertainment Expo\\" with the idea that it could be treated as \\"E cubed\\", however, in conversations with exhibitors, they felt this approach was unnecessary, and that the \\"E3\\" moniker was simple and just as effective. CES overheard these plans, and quickly proposed their own CES-branded video game- only trade show. IDSA and CES approached the larger video game companies to pitch their versions of the show. Many of the younger companies, like Electronic Arts, desired the approach offered by IDSA, including the potential to own part of the show by becoming members of the IDSA, over what the CES offered. The primary holdout to IDSA's plan was Nintendo, who believed their hardware should be treated as consumer electronics and thus should be part of CES. During these negotiations, the CES reserved space in Philadelphia for the show during the month of May, which Ferrell stated was \\"prime time\\" for retailers to prepare for late-year/holiday sales. The IDSA had yet reserved space, and quickly got in contact with the Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC), finding that the space was free for the same dates that CES has planned, effectively forcing potential exhibitors to pick one show or the other. They had chosen Los Angeles as it would be a single-flight travel for those companies coming from Japan, in contrast to Philadelphia. Over the next several weeks, prior to either event having to put down their non-refundable reservation fees, IDSA made an aggressive push to get exhibitors for their show, securing more than 180 vendors. Of the major video game companies, only Nintendo and Microsoft had held out, still undecided which show to attend. Soon after this push, Shapiro contacted Ferrell and told him he \\"won\\"; CES dropped the plans for their Philadelphia event. The same day, Nintendo and Microsoft reached out to Ferrell to discuss exhibition plans at his event. ==Event== At this point, most of the floor space at the LACC was taken up by the early exhibitors. Nintendo had desired space in the larger South Hall, but the early adopters like Sony and Sega had already claimed it. Ferrell made sure that Nintendo still had prime floor space in the West Hall, moving the registration areas to the West Hall so that attendees had to pass Nintendo's booth. Ferrell also had to book extra floor space at a dozen different hotels near the convention center due to demand. Among elements of the first E3 that would continue into future events were large press conferences by the major companies (here, Sony, Sega, and Nintendo) showcasing their up-and-coming hardware and software. Notably, at point, both Sega and Sony were ready to introduce new hardware for Western releases, the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation, respectively. Sega's conference was first, and while Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be immediately available in stores, they were notified soon after that supplies were more limited than thought. During Sony's presentation, after covering many of the PlayStation's games, Steve Race, the lead for bringing the PlayStation to the United States, came on stage, said \\"two-ninety-nine\\" and then left, revealing that the price of the PlayStation was less than that of the Saturn. The moment is considered one of the first proverbial mic drop moments in E3's history, and would continue a trend as each company would try to outdo others at these press events. While official attendance numbers were at 55,000, Ferrell estimated that an additional 10,000 people were able to get in; the event was meant to be limited to professionals in the industry, retailers, and press, but believes that many got in with showing a seemingly-relevant business card. ==Exhibitions== Nintendo The Virtual Boy, Nintendo's intermediary console released between the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo 64, was showcased prominently. The Nintendo 64, then known as the Ultra 64, was presented in a near-final state of development. Games on display included Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, EarthBound, and Killer Instinct. Sega Prior to E3 1995, the Sega Saturn had already released in Japan, and was slated for a September 2, 1995 American release. On the first day of E3 1995, Sega CEO Tom Kalinske gave a keynote presentation in which he revealed the Saturn's release price of US$399, and described the features of the console. Kalinske also revealed that, due to \\"high consumer demand\\", Sega had already shipped 30,000 Saturns to Toys \\"R\\" Us, Babbage's, Electronics Boutique, and Software Etc. for immediate release. Sony Sony announced the price and release date for the then-upcoming PlayStation. Prior to Sony's keynote conference, Sega announced the US$399 retail price for the newly- released Sega Saturn; capitalizing on the opportunity, SCEA President Steve Race made a single, brief statement at Sony's conference: \\"$299\\". The audience cheered as Race walked away from the lectern. ==List of notable exhibitors== This is a list of major video game exhibitors who made appearances at E3 1995: { - valign=top * The 3DO Company * Acclaim Entertainment * Activision * Atari Corporation * Capcom valign=top * Crystal Dynamics * Electronic Arts * LucasArts * Microsoft * Namco valign=top * Nintendo * Sega * Sony Computer Entertainment * SNK * Williams Electronics } == List of featured games == This is a list of notable titles that appeared by their developers or publishers at E3 1995: { - valign=top The 3DO Company *BattleSport (3DO) *Captain Quazar (3DO) *Killing Time (3DO) *Primal Rage (3DO) Acclaim Entertainment *Batman Forever (Genesis, SNES) *Cutthroat Island (Genesis, SNES) *D (3DO) *Foreman For Real (Genesis, SNES) *Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball (Genesis, SNES) *Judge Dredd (Genesis, SNES) *Justice League Task Force (Genesis, SNES) *Myst (Saturn) *NFL Quarterback Club 96 (Genesis, Saturn, SNES) *Revolution X (Genesis, Saturn, SNES) *Robotica (Saturn) *Stargate (Genesis, SNES) *Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (N64) *True Lies (Genesis, SNES) *Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety (Genesis, SNES) *Warlock (Genesis, SNES) *WWF Raw (32X, Genesis, SNES) Activision *MechWarrior 3050 (SNES) *Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure (32X) Atari Corporation *Battlemorph (Jaguar CD) *BattleSphere (Jaguar) *Blue Lightning (Jaguar CD) *Brett Hull NHL Hockey (Jaguar, Jaguar CD) *Caves of Fear (Jaguar CD) *Creature Shock (Jaguar CD) *Deathwatch (Jaguar) *Defender 2000 (Jaguar) *Fight for Life (Jaguar) *FlipOut!

In 1955 Gillen also set a new world record for the 5 km individual pursuit at the opening of the Palazzo dello Sport in Milan, where he took two seconds off the old record held by Rolf Graf, recording a time of 6:19.2. He also competed in 143 six-day races, making his debut in 1948 at the Six Days of New York, where he and team-mate Mett Clemens finished second. He took a total of 11 six-day wins between 1953 and 1964. He retired from international competition in April 1966. After his cycling career, he worked in banking.

From there, the film shifts to the young man, his sister, and their companions on a wild picnic. They decide on a whim to spend the night in a graveyard where they perform a s√©ance raising the dead. The majority of the action is conveyed through flashbacks and nightmare sequences. ==Production and exhibition== According to Caelum Vatnsdal‚Äôs book They Came from Within, The Corpse Eaters was produced in 1973 by a teenaged Zazelenchuk with a meagre budget of $36,000 culled from the proceeds of his drive-in located in Greater Sudbury. Because his first and only feature film had such a small budget, Zazelenchuk couldn‚Äôt afford his ideal star, John Carradine. Instead, Zazelenchuk brought local theatre performers and high school friends together to make what some consider Canada‚Äôs first gore film. Zazelenchuk financed, wrote and produced the film. He is also credited with the special makeup effects. He left the direction to Donald R. Passmore, who was soon replaced with Klaus Vetter, who also served as the film's cinematographer. On August 16, 1974, at the 69 Drive-In, The Corpse Eaters premiered in Greater Sudbury. A successful local run followed before Zazalenchuk was offered $5,000 for distribution rights from distributor Howard Mahler under his banner Howard Mahler Films. The distributor, however, did not inform Zazelenchuk that he was purchasing the film without any intent on releasing it. It was used as a tax write off, and declared as a loss. The film was never released theatrically elsewhere. The film faded into obscurity for years until Encore Home Video rediscovered it in 1993 and released it on DVD several years later, claiming to have transferred their copy from the only known surviving print. This version runs 57 minutes, and is considered incomplete, making it a partially lost film. However, the original negatives still exist, and are held at Library and Archives Canada (LAC). == Availability == The original negatives, 35mm prints, and other source materials are held at Library and Archives Canada (LAC). As of 2020, the film is still under copyright, with the rights being held by Don Zazelenchuk. The copyright, however, should expire no later than 2024 (50 years from 1974), which would make it fall into public domain and allow it to be freely accessible for duplication. A 35mm print is also available at the Kinsey Institute of Indiana University. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1974 films Category:Canadian films Category:1974 horror films Category:1974 independent films Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian zombie films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Greater Sudbury Category:Films set in Northern Ontario Category:Canadian splatter films Category:Lost Canadian films ","title":"The Corpse Eaters"},{"id":"54265310","text":"Estrone sulfamate (EMATE; developmental code name J994), or estrone-3-O-sulfamate, is a steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitor which has not yet been marketed. It is the C3 sulfamate ester of the estrogen estrone. Unlike other estrogen esters however, EMATE is not an effective prodrug of estrogens. A closely related compound is estradiol sulfamate (E2MATE), which is extensively metabolized into EMATE and has similar properties to it. EMATE shows high bioavailability and undergoes little or no first-pass metabolism with oral administration. The sulfamate moiety of EMATE results in carbonic anhydrase binding which, in turn, results in EMATE being taken up into and stored in erythrocytes in the blood. Since this occurs in the hepatic portal vein, it prevents EMATE from entering the liver during the first pass with the oral route. The inhibition of STS by EMATE prevents its bioactivation into estrone and estradiol, which in turn accounts for the lack of estrogenicity of EMATE. A short initial peak of estradiol and estrone levels was observed with E2MATE at the start of treatment in humans, followed by very high and long- lasting concentrations of EMATE and estrone sulfate in erythrocytes, observations that are in accordance with STS inhibition. EMATE is an extremely potent and irreversible inhibitor of STS. It was found to have an of 65 pM for STS inhibition in MCF-7 cells, with an almost complete inhibition of the hydrolysis of physiological concentrations of the steroid sulfates estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in MCF-7 cells observed at a concentration of 1 ŒºM. At a dosage of 1 mg/kg orally or subcutaneously in rats, it effectively abolished estrone and DHEA-S sulfatase activities in all tissues assessed. It also showed a prolonged duration of action, with only a small recovery (<10%) of hepatic STS activity occurring 7 days after a single 10 mg/kg dose in rats. Due to its ability to prevent the conversion of hormonally inactive steroid sulfates into their hormonally active forms (e.g., estrone sulfate into estrone), STS inhibitors like EMATE have potential applications in the treatment of estrogen-dependent conditions like estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and endometriosis. However, estrogenicity was paradoxically observed with EMATE in rodents, and this resulted in clinical development of the compound not being pursued. However, E2MATE was investigated as an estradiol prodrug with improved oral pharmacokinetics and little or no first-pass hepatic impact in humans, but was found to completely lack estrogenic effects. Following this, E2MATE was repurposed as an STS inhibitor, and is now under development for the treatment of endometriosis.https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800026648 ==See also== * List of estrogen esters ¬ß Estrone esters * Steroid sulfatase ¬ß Inhibitors ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Estranes Category:Estrone esters Category:Ketones Category:Steroid sulfatase inhibitors Category:Sulfamate esters ","title":"Estrone sulfamate"},{"id":"54265328","text":"Ken Ramsauer (December 26, 1954 - May 24, 1983) was an American businessperson. He was a hardware store manager and freelance lighting designer who became the first person with AIDS to be the subject of a national network television news special when he was interviewed by Geraldo Rivera on the 20/20 television program broadcast four days before his death in 1983. At the time little was known of AIDS, including its means of transmission. A candlelight vigil was held in Central Park commemorating his life and death, opened by New York Mayor Ed Koch and attracting 1,500 people. The vigil was later covered in the book version of How to Survive a Plague. Around 600 individuals were known to have died from AIDS at the time of Ramsauer's death, and their names were read aloud at the vigil. The vigil was called \\"the first large gathering acknowledging the existence of the epidemic\\". At the time of his death, the public was advised by authorities to avoid contact with individuals infected with HIV. Ramsauer recalled in the 20/20 interview how he was treated by hospital staff who he overheard asking \\"I wonder how long the faggot in 208 is going to last.\\" Some sources have stated that Ramsauer was sought out by the 20/20 producers for the shocking appearance of a man near death, seeking \\"the most debilitated people with AIDS they could find\\".

It crossed the Adair Viaduct over the Iowa Interstate Railroad (IAIS) as it traveled north through the town. North of Adair, the highway took a sharp turn to the east and headed due east for a few miles. Just west of Casey, the railroad approached the highway's south side and the two closely paralleled each other for a few miles. East of Casey, the highway met Iowa 25, which came from Guthrie Center to the north. The two routes headed east together on a viaduct over the IAIS. Shortly thereafter, Iowa 25 split away to the south toward Greenfield.

Through Stuart, the highway followed Front Street, which represented the Adair‚ÄìGuthrie county line. The IAIS line approached the highway again and guided the road toward Dexter.

However, with the significant mileage the DOT wished to turn over, the Iowa General Assembly passed a law which granted the DOT a one-time exemption from the transfer rules effective July 1, 2003. Iowa 925 was replaced by County Road N54 (CR N54) from Adair to the sharp curve north of town and by CR F65 from the curve through Dexter.

Jack Friar (John Henshaw), a local tradesman and manager of non-league side St Helens Town, spots Trautmann keeping goal against other POWs during a trip to deliver treats to the camp commander and bribes the commander into allowing Trautmann to be allowed out of the camp, whereupon he recruits him to play as goalkeeper for his relegation-threatened side. The other players are angered to be asked to play alongside a man who from a country they are still at war with, but with little other option they agree to take to the field. A string of strong performances see the players slowly come to accept Bert's place in the team. As a condition of his continuing appearances Friar agrees to let Bert help work in his shop, leading Friar's daughter Margaret (Freya Mavor) to soften her initially- hostile stance, and the pair begin an unlikely romance. As St Helens Town come to their crunch relegation-deciding match at the end of the season, it is announced that the war's end has led to an offer for the German POWs to be repatriated. Although Trautmann is free to return to his home in Bremen, he instead chooses to stay to support his side. After the match, Manchester City manager Jock Thomson (Gary Lewis), who has come on a scouting mission, approaches Bert and offers him a place in his City team to replace the retiring Frank Swift. At their end-of-season party his teammates present him with a hamper to take home to his family, but Bert's growing connection with Margaret leads him instead to stay, and in due course they are married. In 1949, Bert travels to Manchester to sign for City. The press conference for his arrival rapidly turns hostile as the Manchester press - representing a city with a large Jewish population - demand Bert answer questions on his military background. Protesting crowds form outside Maine Road and the City supporters barrage him with booing but Thomson and his City side refuse to join them, instead stating \\"there's no war in this dressing room\\". At an acrimonious meeting with season ticket holders Thomson and the City board struggle to contain the fury of the city's residents but a passionate plea by Margaret strikes home with the influential Rabbi Altmann (Butz Ulrich Buse), who writes an open letter to the city published in a local paper asking them to examine all men individually without national bias. Following Altmann's letter, and with continuing fine performances on the field of play, the mood shifts and soon Trautmann is even being welcomed by players of other teams around the country. By 1956 Bert and Margaret are living an idyllic existence with their young son John, while Manchester City's strong run has led them to the FA Cup Final. As City take a strong 3‚Äì1 lead Bert is again winning plaudits for his masterful goalkeeping, when a dangerous collision with Birmingham City player Peter Murphy shatters a vertebra in his neck and almost costs him his life. With 20 minutes of the game left to go, and clearly in a bad state, Trautmann refuses to leave the field and continues to make several brave saves, stopping Birmingham City from scoring any further goals and thus winning City the cup. His joy leads to tragedy, however, as during his recuperation his son is hit by a car and killed. Their heartbreak causes Margaret to grow more distant with Bert, while he himself becomes convinced that his loss is a karmic consequence of his inaction when witnessing war atrocities in Ukraine, and the film leaves them still working through the resulting difficulties in their marriage. As the film ends with footage of Trautmann's continuing City career, overlaid text reveals that Trautmann would continue to appear for Manchester City until 1964, would be named the first foreign awardee of the English Player of the Year title, and would in time be recognised by both the British and German governments for his work in promoting Anglo-German relations. == Cast == * David Kross as Bert Trautmann * Freya Mavor as Margaret Friar * John Henshaw as Jack Friar * Dervla Kirwan as Clarice Friar * Dave Johns as Roberts * Harry Melling as Sergeant Smythe * Chloe Harris as Betsy * Mikey Collins as Alf Myers * Gary Lewis as Jock Thomson * Michael Socha as Bill Twist * Angus Barnett as Clive Thornton * Stuart Donaghy as lead football team-mate * Butz Ulrich Buse as Rabbi Altmann * Tony Wright / VerseChorusVerse as Ice Cream Man == Production == Before Trautmann's death in 2013, Rosenm√ºller and Marciniak spent several days interviewing him about details for inclusion in the film.

The book describes how the September 11 attacks changed the traditional Muslim community around the globe. Nance criticizes the approach of the George W. Bush administration, including the verbiage and public presentations used in the War on Terror. The author argues al-Qaeda is not part of Islam but is instead a dangerous religious cult. Nance writes the United States should commit to better education with a public relations campaign to encourage traditional believers in Islam around the world to denounce al-Qaeda. Nance's work received a favorable book review from Journal of Strategic Security, which recommended it for new counterterrorism analysts, including those \\"developing their understanding of information operations and understanding the role of religion in the battle\\". ShadowProof praised the author's expertise in the subject matter of counterterrorism, observing Nance sharply criticized the manner in which the United States was losing the psychological warfare battle against al-Qaeda. The work received a critical book review from Publishers Weekly, which called it a \\"polemic\\". Additionally, a book review by Kirkus Reviews criticized it for \\"repetition and vitriol\\". ==Background== Malcolm Nance, author of An End to al-Qaeda Malcolm Nance is a retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer in naval cryptology. He garnered expertise within the fields of intelligence and counterterrorism. He served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, from 1981-2001. Nance was an interpreter for Russian, and began working in the intelligence field through research into the history of the Soviet Union and its spying agency, the KGB. He devoted years of research to analyzing Middle East terrorism and sovereign nations with ties to Russia. He graduated from New York's Excelsior College with a degree in Arabic. Nance took part in combat operations which occurred after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, was involved with the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, served on the USS Wainwright during Operation Praying Mantis and participated in the sinking of Iranian missile boat Joshan, served on the USS Tripoli during the Gulf War, and assisted during a Banja Luka, Bosnia air strike. After retiring from military service, Nance founded a consulting company based in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. where he provided advising services to United States Special Operations Command. During the September 11 attacks, Nance personally witnessed American Airlines Flight 77 crash into The Pentagon and he assisted in rescue operations at the impact site. He created a training center called the Advanced Terrorism, Abduction and Hostage Survival School. Nance manages a think tank analyzing counterterrorism called \\"Terror Asymmetrics Project on Strategy, Tactics and Radical Ideologies\\", consisting of Central Intelligence Agency and military intelligence officers with direct prior field experience. Nance is a member of the board of directors for the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. Nance's books on counter-terrorism include: The Terrorists of Iraq, Terrorist Recognition Handbook, The Plot to Hack America, Defeating ISIS, and Hacking ISIS. ==Summary== An End to al-Qaeda describes how Nance believes al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden can be defeated. Nance argues that al- Qaeda's true objective is to conquer Muslims and bring them to their extremist ideology, and that al-Qaeda wishes to bring Muslims into an extremist global kingdom not seen since before the time of Kemal Atat√ºrk of Turkey. According to Nance, al-Qaeda wishes to revert Muslim society further back in time than Atat√ºrk, to a version of culture at a time before 12-century Muslim history; the group believes Islam was perverted subsequent to interactions with the Mongol Empire and the Crusades. The author asserts the United States government must attempt to break the ties between the traditional Islamic population and the extremism offered by al-Qaeda, so that al-Qaeda's source of human resources and influence will be removed. According to Nance, al-Qaeda is attempting to capitalize on decreasing United States influence within the region, and utilize information technology to spread its message. An End to al-Qaeda grounds the reader within a background of how the Muslim people globally have greatly changed subsequent to the September 11 attacks. Nance is critical of the public presentation of the War on Terror declared by the George W. Bush Administration. He asserts the Muslim people have a wide range of spiritual practices, and it should be the goal of the United States to appeal to their humanistic values. Nance describes al-Qaeda's psychological warfare towards the United States as only enhanced if the U.S. continues to frame the battle as a war against Islam. The book characterizes al-Qaeda not as an offshoot of Islam but as a destructive religious cult. Nance suggests American federal officials create a position to coordinate actions against al- Qaeda, put together academic gatherings to discuss the matter, and use public relations to counter extremist ideology. Nance praises Barack Obama's oratorical skills, and characterizes the president as a formidable public relations tool to use in achieving these objectives. He emphasizes traditional Muslim people share the same goals and aspirations for their families as U.S. citizens. Nance puts forth specific suggestions on how to turn the tide against al-Qaeda's psychological warfare strategies. He backs up his thesis with case studies from his past expertise garnered as an intelligence officer fluent in the Arabic language. There is great emphasis on how much difference can be made by taking great care to use specific verbiage in communication with the Muslim community. Nance calls for a cultural widespread climate of denouncement of al-Qaeda by the Muslim community, through educating believers in Islam about the harms of al-Qaeda's goals to create an extremist Islamic empire. ==Release and reception== The book was first published in hardcover format in 2010 by St. Martin's Press. Its first printing was for 100,000 copies. The work was released in audiobook format in 2010 and 2015. St. Martin's Press released an e-book edition in 2013. Journal of Strategic Security published a book review of Nance's work written by Keely M. Fahoum of Henley-Putnam University. Fahoum wrote, \\"An End to Al-Qaeda presents a thought-provoking discussion about Al-Qaeda (AQ), its leadership, intentions, and attempts to recruit members in the ideological battlefield.\\" The review noted Nance's expertise in the subject matter, \\"The book draws on the author's expertise as a counterterrorism (CT) officer and Arabic linguist, and his experience studying AQ in the field, including in combat.\\" Fahoum concluded, \\"An End to Al-Qaeda is a good read for those analysts in the CT community still developing their understanding of information operations and understanding the role of religion in the battle between AQ and the rest of the world's Muslims\\". ShadowProof journalist Matt Duss pointed out the Nance's expertise in the subject matter, \\"Few Americans can claim the knowledge of radical terrorist ideologies that Malcolm Nance can.\\" He wrote that An End to al-Qaeda, \\"describes the nature and extent of the Al Qaeda threat, and suggests that the key to ending Al Qaeda is to vigorously challenge them in the realm of ideology.\\" Duss observed, \\"Nance goes ... hard at the incompetence with which the U.S. has thus far waged the ideological battle against Al Qaeda.\\" Publishers Weekly gave the work a negative review, writing: \\"Intelligence veteran Nance offers a problematic prescription for defeating al-Qaeda in this disappointing polemic.\\" The review criticized the writing style, calling it, \\"melodramatic\\", \\"preachy\\", and \\"pedantic\\". Kirkus Reviews was critical of the way Nance presented his arguments in the book, concluding, \\"An often cogent argument weakened by unnecessary repetition and vitriol‚Äîreads like a hybrid of a counterinsurgency manual and a consultant's business plan.\\" ==See also== *Iraq War *Islamic extremism *Islamic fundamentalism *Islamic terrorism *War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Political science books Category:Non-fiction books about war Category:Non-fiction books about jihadism Category:Books about counter-terrorism Category:Books about al-Qaeda Category:Books about Islamic fundamentalism Category:Books by Malcolm Nance ","title":"An End to al-Qaeda"},{"id":"54265874","text":"Essiet Okon Essiet (born September 1, 1956, Omaha, Nebraska) is an American jazz double-bassist.

Traditionally, the Ts√ºngkoteps√º could only be worn by warriors who had successfully taken the heads of enemy warriors, although more recently, the right to wear the Ts√ºngkoteps√º was associated with performing a mithun sacrifice, a demonstration of wealth. The shawls are now available for purchase throughout India, and are a distinctive symbol of the Ao tribe. ==History== In pre-colonial Ao society, shawls were used as a marker of social status. The Ts√ºngkoteps√º was the highest-ranking male shawl. ==Design and symbolism== The shawl is black and red striped with a single white stripe in the middle containing depictions of animals and other symbols and a brighter red region at the bottom. There are symbols in the white region representing the sun, the moon and the stars, which represent the resulting fame of warriors who wear the shawl. There are also several animals depicted in the strip, which are symbolic of the physical power and the valour of the warrior: a hornbill, a culturally significant bird whose feathers are used for decorative purpose in ceremonial costumes, is often depicted, as are mithun, which represent the wealth of the warrior. (as only wealthier members of the tribe could afford to rear mithun). A spear, dao and cock are common motifs in the section depicting the animals. The symbols in the white band are sometimes replaced with depictions of mithun, which also represent the wealth and success of the warrior, and there may be elephant and tiger pattern prints on the shawl to symbolise the strength of the warrior. ==Cultural impact== Various Naga tribes are well-known for their shawls, and the Ts√ºngkoteps√º is one of the most well-known examples. Every Time You Tell a Story In January 2015, the filmmakers Ruchika Negi and Amit Mahanti produced a documentary about the Ts√ºngkoteps√º titled Every Time You Tell a Story, which aims to document and preserve the cultural tradition surrounding the shawl. The film was screened in March 2017 by the India Foundation for the Arts.

After education at Shrewsbury School (1953-1958) he proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin (1958-1963), where he was a Foundation Scholar in Classics and won several academic prizes, including the Tyrrell Memorial Gold Medal for Greek and Latin verse and prose composition (1960)The Irish Times, 14 June 1960; The Times, 14 June 1960, p. 6. After gaining First Class Honours and a Moderatorship Prize (1962),The Times, 7 December 1962, p. 14. he carried out postgraduate research under Donald Ernest Wilson Wormell for a thesis entitled Lucretius: The Man and His Mission (MLitt, Dublin, 1965). From 1963 to 1988 Smith taught Classics at the University College of North Wales, Bangor (now Bangor University), from 1977 as Professor. From 1988 he was Professor of Classics at Durham University. Problems with his eyesight compelled him to take early retirement from university teaching in 1995. He continues to be associated with Durham University as Professor Emeritus in the Department of Classics and Ancient History. Smith married Elizabeth Mary Dempsey (1935-1997) of Dublin on 4 April 1964. The marriage was dissolved in 1981. He has a daughter and a granddaughter. Since 1995 he has lived on the remote and rugged island of Foula in Shetland. In ‚Äúretirement‚Äù he has continued to be very active in research and writing, not only on classical subjects, but also on modern ones. In 2007 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \\"for services to scholarship\\"The Times, 16 June 2007, p. 75.. == Research == As a classical scholar, Smith has a high international reputation for his work on two writers who made it their business to expound the doctrines of the Greek philosopher Epicurus. One is the Roman poet Lucretius (c.98-c.55 BC), author of De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things). Smith‚Äôs translation of the six-book work was first published in England in 1969Lucretius: On the Nature of Things, Sphere Books, London, 1969. and reissued, with revisions, in the United States in 2001.Lucretius: On the Nature of Things, Hackett, Indianapolis/Cambridge MA, 2001. He is also the editor of the Loeb Classical Library text of the poem, accompanied with an introduction, critical and explanatory notes, bibliography, and index, and with the translation of W. H. D. Rouse (1924) revised to make it accord with the new text.Lucretius, De Rerum Natura, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, 1975, revised 1982, 1992. A block of the philosophical inscription of Diogenes of Oinoanda, recorded in 2012. The text (New Fragment 207) is part of the preface to his Ethics. The other author is Diogenes of Oinoanda, who, probably early in the second century AD, presented his exposition of Epicurean philosophy in a Greek inscription carved on the wall of a stoa (colonnade) in the centre of his home-city in northern Lycia, in the mountains of southwest Asia Minor (Turkey). The inscription, which may have occupied 260 square metres of wall-space and contained about 25,000 words, is the longest known from the ancient world. The wall that carried the inscription fell down or (more likely) was deliberately demolished in later antiquity, and its blocks were reused as building material in various parts of the city. 88 pieces of the inscription were discovered by French and Austrian epigraphists between 1884 and 1895, but many decades of inactivity followed. In 1968 Smith inaugurated a long series of new investigations at Oinoanda that have now continued for half a century and much more than tripled the number of known fragments of one of the most remarkable documents to have survived from the ancient world. The latest tally (October 2017) is 305. Smith worked first by himself (1968-1973), then in collaboration with the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara (1974‚Äì2003), and most recently (from 2007) with international teams led, until his early death in 2016, by Martin Bachmann, vice-director of the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. In this third phase Smith has worked in very close collaboration, both on and off the site, with J√ºrgen Hammerstaedt of the University of Cologne.On the inscription of Diogenes of Oinoanda and the discoveries of numerous new texts made since 1968, see M.

Hammerstaedt & M. F. Smith, The Epicurean Inscription of Diogenes of Oinoanda: Ten Years of New Discoveries and Research, Rudolf Habelt, Bonn, 2014. Smith has published his work on Diogenes‚Äô inscription in five books and about 75 articles. The latest book and the series of articles in the journal Epigraphica Anatolica (2007-2012, 2016, 2018), in which the numerous and important discoveries made since 2007 are presented, were co-authored with J√ºrgen Hammerstaedt. A documentary film, A Gigantic Jigsaw Puzzle: The Epicurean Inscription of Diogenes of Oinanda, directed by Nazim G√ºveloƒülu was released in 2015 and can be viewed at http://www.metu.edu.tr/videos/giganticpuzzle. Smith takes a prominent and completely unrehearsed part in the film, which has won awards in Athens, Split, Sicily, and elsewhere. Since 2010 Smith, while continuing to be closely involved with classical studies and especially Diogenes of Oinoanda, has also established a considerable reputation for his highly original research and writing on a variety of twentieth-century figures.

It was released on September 8, 2017 by Sacred Bones Records. The album was written in Danilova's hometown in Wisconsin, where she retreated after dealing with depression and dark times experienced by her close friends. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 25 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Emma Madden of Clash praised the album, saying \\"the production is absolutely masterful.

Upon systemic administration, regardless of route of administration, DHED has been found to rapidly and selectively convert into estradiol in the brain, whereas no such conversion occurs in the rest of the body. Moreover, DHED itself possesses no estrogenic activity, requiring transformation into estradiol for its estrogenicity. As such, the drug shows selective estrogenic effects in the brain (e.g., alleviation of hot flashes, neuroprotection) that are said to be identical to those of estradiol, whereas estrogenic effects elsewhere in the body are not observed. DHED has been proposed as a possible novel estrogenic treatment for neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with hypoestrogenism (e.g., menopausal hot flashes, depression, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke) that uniquely lacks potentially detrimental estrogenic side effects in the periphery. ==References== Category:Centrally selective drugs Category:Conjugated dienes Category:Diols Category:Estranes Category:Enones Category:Prodrugs Category:Synthetic estrogens Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Tertiary alcohols ","title":"10Œ≤,17Œ≤-Dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one"},{"id":"54266252","text":"Antonio Numai (died 1568) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Isernia (1524‚Äì1567).

Magic Lizard has to go to the aid of the giant guardian, while having to run to various locations throughout Thailand such as Bridge on the River Kwai and Phae Mueang Phi to escape the hunt of people who want to capture it. Magic Lizard has to experience adventures with things such as man- eating crocodiles, wild elephants with tigers, a mother and baby black bear, train runners, giant mosquitoes, and skeleton ghosts. ==Production and reception== The concept of Magic Lizard came from director/producer Sompote Sands' nephew who had studied in Australia and brought a frilled lizard which is an endemic species. He saw it as cute and made it as a main character. The film was released in Japan by NHK in the Japanese title \\"„Ç®„É™„Éû„Ç±„Éà„Ç´„Ç≤‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÊóÖ\\" (Erimaketokage hitoritabi; lit: \\"frilled lizard alone travel\\"). But the released in Thailand, it appears that the income is not good. Because at that time, a most of people are fond of a Hong Kong's wuxia series in the form of video tapes. As a result, the film was copied as a massively distributed video. Which is copyright infringement, but in the meantime copyright law has not yet been drafted. After this Sompote traveled to Japan to work about Ultra Series only.

It started as a three-part story titled \\"Time Cop: A Man Out of Time,\\" in a 1992 Dark Horse anthology comic, which inspired the 1993 TV series Time Trax and 1994 film Timecop starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. The film was a box office success, and inspired a video game for SNES, a single-season ABC TV series, three novels, and a sequel in 2003. ==Films== Timecop The film adaptation of \\"Time Cop: A Man in Time\\" was directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Sam Raimi and Moshe Diamant. Jean-Claude Van Damme played police officer Max Walker, who is recruited by Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) in 1994 to bring a rogue politician, Senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver), to justice. Through his investigation, Walker discovers that the senator is also responsible for numerous other previously unconnected crimes, including the earlier death of his wife, played by Mia Sara. Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision Timecop 2 was directed by Steve Boyum and written by Gary Scott Thompson. Van Damme did not return‚Äîthe lead role was instead fulfilled by Jason Scott Lee. Lee plays TEC agent Ryan Chung, who has to stop Brandon Miller, the head of an agency supervising TEC, who intends to change history by assassinating Adolf Hitler in 1940. The film was released in 2003 directly to home video.  Future  In 2014, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Universal Studios was developing a reboot of Timecop due to success of the 2012 time travelling film Looper. Richardson was to be the executive producer. == Television == Following the film's success, American Broadcasting Company ordered a series based on Timecop. They agreed to produce 13 episodes on a $15 million budget. Universal Television produced the resulting series, using the same title as the film. Mark Verheiden wrote the screenplay for the pilot. The show was first aired in 1997. None of the cast or characters from the film reprised their roles in the series. Ted King starred in a breakout role as TEC agent Jack Logan (a character later used in the novels) who hunts down rogue travelers and brings them to justice before they can alter the past. Due to low ratings and poor advertising, the series was cut short after less than a season, and only nine out of the thirteen episodes were aired. ==Other media==  Comics  Mike Richardson, the founder of Dark Horse Comics, wrote a three-issue story titled \\"Time Cop: A Man Out of Time\\". The story was included in issues No. 1‚Äì3 of the Dark Horse Comics anthology series in 1992. Richardson developed the story, while the comic was written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Ron Randall. The plot of the comic differs from film's plot, but Max Walker is the protagonist of both works. Richardson and Verheiden went on to write the screenplay for the film. They also published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film in September 1994, coinciding with the film's release. Novels Dan Parkinson wrote an adventure trilogy based on the Timecop series, covering Jack Logan's further hunts for rogue time travellers who try to alter the past. Published by Del Rey Books, the trilogy consisted of The Scavenger (August 1998), Viper's Spawn (September 1998) and Blood Ties (March 1999). Video games A side-scrolling action game based on the Timecop film was produced by Cryo Interactive for Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. The game is notable for being one of the first to use digitized images of the film's cast to portray game characters‚Äîlive actors had been filmed in front of a bluescreen. The player has to stop Dr. Hans Kleindast, the inventor of time travel, following him through various time periods throughout the game's 15 levels.

Wyandot's focuses on the creation of plant-based snack products made from ancient grains such as sorghum and quinoa, pulses such as chickpeas, and flaxseed, among others. ==History== Wyandot Popcorn Company was founded in Wyandot County, Ohio during the Great Depression by Hoover and Ava (King) Brown. Mrs. Brown was the daughter of George W. King, one of the founders of the Marion Power Shovel Company. In 1936, as a way to diversify their family's farming income from grains and livestock, the Browns planted their first 100 acres of popcorn and entered the business of growing and selling raw popcorn. Popcorn became a popular treat in America at the time given its affordability. In 1948 a subsidiary, Popped-Right Corn Company, was established initially to sell ready-to-eat (RTE) popcorn to movie theatres. Popped-Right, in conjunction with local Marion candy company Shirk's, created one of the first formulas of caramel popcorn for broad commercialization. In 1964 both Wyandot Popcorn and Popped-Right consolidated their office operations into a new facility in Marion, Ohio while maintaining the raw popcorn processing on the farm in Wyandot County. Also in the 1960s Popped-Right, under the direction of son Warren Brown, diversified into corn-based snacks to supply regional potato chip marketers who were seeking to compete against a growing Frito Lay. The raw popcorn business, led by son George Brown, continued to grow as well, to the point where Wyandot was selling 50 million pounds of popcorn and selling it to over 75 countries, representing nearly a quarter of the global trade in raw popcorn.Rotuno-Johson, Michelle.

In 1989 Wyandot sold its raw popcorn operation to Vogel Popcorn, who subsequently sold the business to ConAgra Foods.Smith, Andrew F.

Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long borne on a spike high with three or four spreading stem leaves. The flowers are translucent white with green stripes and brownish tips. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is much longer than the petals and curves forward with a long, tapering tip. The lateral sepals are erect leaving a wide gap between them and the galea, and there is a deep narrow notch in the centre of the sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide, curved, dark green to brownish, twist prominently to the right and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs between July and October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis agathicola was first formally described in 1997 by David Jones, Brian Molloy and Mark Clements from a specimen collected in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges.

It was also called the Russia investigation, the Mueller probe, and the Mueller investigation. Prior to the appointment of the Special Counsel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been, starting in July 2016, covertly investigating activities by Russian operatives and by members of the Trump presidential campaign, under the code name \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\". The investigation culminated with the Mueller Report which concluded that ‚Äî though the Trump campaign welcomed Russian interference and expected to benefit from it ‚Äî there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy charges against Trump or his associates. The Report did not reach a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice, citing a Justice Department guideline that prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president.Mueller Report, Vol. II, p.1 In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to take over the FBI's work. As Rosenstein later informed Congress, he elected to use a Special Counsel because of the ongoing concerns about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and his own concerns about the capabilities of the acting Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, to carry out the investigation, but the lack of any Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys at that point meant that he would need to appoint someone else. Mueller was an appropriate choice in his view.Matt Zapotosky, \\"Rosenstein says, in hindsight, he would not have signed application to surveil former Trump campaign adviser,\\" Washington Post, June 3, 2020; Rebecca Shabad, \\"Rod Rosenstein defends Mueller appointment, approval of FISA applications in Russia Probe,\\" NBC News, June 3, 2020; Ian Schwartz, \\"Rosenstein: If I Knew Then What I Know Now, I Would Not Have Signed Warrant Application for Carter Page,\\" RealClearPolitics, June 3, 2020; CNN, \\"Read: Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's Opening Statement Before Senate Judiciary Committee,\\" CNN, June 3, 2020. According to its authorizing document, the investigation's scope included allegations of \\"links and/or coordination\\" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Mueller was also mandated to pursue \\"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\\" The probe included a criminal investigation which looked into potential obstruction of justice charges against President Trump and members of his campaign or his administration. The New York Times reported in August 2020 that Rosenstein curtailed a May 2017 FBI inquiry into Trump‚Äôs personal and financial dealings in Russia, giving the bureau the impression that the special counsel would investigate it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to. The investigation was officially concluded on March 22, 2019, with the Mueller Report submitted to Attorney General William Barr. Barr had been critical of the investigation before he became Attorney General. A redacted version of the report was released to the public on April 18, 2019. The report concluded that the Internet Research Agency's social media campaign supported Trump's presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton's, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and various Democratic Party organizations. The investigation \\"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\\", and determined that the Trump campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally\\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \\"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p.2: Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony. Mueller later said that the investigation's conclusion on Russian interference \\"deserves the attention of every American\\". On potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, the investigation \\"does not conclude that the President committed a crime\\", as investigators would not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. However, the investigation \\"also does not exonerate\\" Trump, finding both public and private actions \\"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations\\". Ten episodes of potential obstruction by the president were described. The report states that Congress can decide whether Trump obstructed justice, and has the authority to take action against him.Mueller Report, vol. II, p.8: With respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. [...] The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law. Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had authorized the Mueller probe, decided on March 24, 2019, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a finding of obstruction of justice. Upon his resignation on May 29, 2019, Mueller stated that: \\"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing\\". In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after he left office. == Original claims of Russian election involvement == The first public US government assertion of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election came in a joint statement on September 22, 2016, by Senator Dianne Feinstein and House member Adam Schiff, the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively. The US Intelligence Community released a similar statement fifteen days later. In January 2017, an assessment was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, then headed by Obama appointee James Clapper, which asserted that Russian leadership had favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over rival candidate Hillary Clinton, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally ordered an \\"influence campaign\\" to harm Clinton's electoral chances and \\"undermine public faith in the US democratic process\\". It is alleged that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election by bolstering the candidacies of Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein in order to increase political instability in the United States as well as to damage the Clinton presidential campaign. == Origin and powers ==  Original FBI investigations  When the special counsel was appointed by Rod Rosenstein in May 2017, the special counsel took over an existing counterintelligence investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into what proved to be Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and numerous secretive links between Trump associates and Russian officials. According to reports, Australian officials informed American officials that in May 2016, a Trump presidential campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, told the Australian High Commissioner to Britain, Alexander Downer, that Russian officials were in possession of politically damaging information relating to Hillary Clinton, the rival presidential candidate to Trump from Democratic Party. Since the FBI, in response to this information, opened an investigation into the links between Trump associates and Russian officials on July 31, 2016, the meeting between Papadopoulos and Downer is considered to be the 'spark' that led to the Mueller investigation.Multiple sources: # # # # # # # # In February 2018, the Nunes memo, written by staff for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, stated that the information on Papadopoulos \\"triggered the opening of\\" the original FBI investigation,Multiple sources: # # # # # # # rather than the Trump-Russia dossier of Christopher Steele (see below) as asserted by, among others, Trump, Nunes, Fox News hosts Steve Doocy, Ed Henry, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy. The special counsel also took over an FBI investigation on whether President Trump had committed obstruction of justice, which began within eight days after Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. CNN reported in December 2018 that then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe started the investigation based on Comey's firing‚Äîwhich had been recommended in writing by Rosenstein in what became known as the Comey memo‚Äîand also Comey's allegation that Trump had asked him to stop investigating Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In February 2019, McCabe, since fired from the FBI, confirmed he launched the obstruction of justice investigation for those reasons, and gave additional reasons such as Trump's multiple depictions of the investigation into Trump associates and Russia as a \\"witch hunt\\", as well as Trump allegedly telling Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to mention the Russia probe in Rosenstein's memo to recommend firing Comey, and Trump's comments to the Russian ambassador and NBC relating Comey's firing to the Russia probe.  Appointment and original oversight  Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions issues statement announcing his recusal. A special counsel investigation is subject to oversight by the Attorney General. After questions arose regarding contacts between then-senator Jeff Sessions and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in 2016, one of the first things Sessions did after being appointed Attorney General, was to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations regarding Russian interference in the election. Once Attorney General Sessions recused, oversight of any Russia investigation into the 2016 election fell to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. As part of his oversight, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017 with the mandate \\"to oversee the previously- confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters\\". Rosenstein has said he would recuse himself from supervision of Mueller if he himself were to become a subject in the investigation due to his role in the dismissal of Comey. If Rosenstein were to recuse himself, his duties in this matter would have been assumed by the Justice Department's third-in-command, Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio. So long as no successor fills that office, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would assume the authorities of Associate Attorney General.  Reasons for appointing a special counsel   Firing of James Comey  The special counsel appointment on May 17, 2017, came after protests, mostly from Democrats, over President Trump firing the FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. In Congress, in reaction to Comey's firing, over 130 Democratic lawmakers called for a special counsel to be appointed, over 80 Democratic lawmakers called for an independent investigation, while over 40 Republican lawmakers expressed questions or concerns. Complicating the situation, Comey arranged to leak to the press classified information, notes from an interview with the president where Trump asked him to end the probe into Michael Flynn. Comey would later be rebuked by the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General for this action.Mark Moore, Bob Fredericks and Aaron Feis, \\"James Comey violated FBI rules, set 'dangerous example' by leaking memo: DOJ watchdog,\\" New York Post, August 29, 2019. Trump fired Comey on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The New York Times reported on January 11, 2019, that FBI counterintelligence grew concerned about Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off opening an investigation because of uncertainty about how to proceed on such a sensitive matter. Trump's behavior during the days immediately before and after Comey's firing caused them to begin investigating whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests, knowingly or unknowingly. The FBI merged that counterintelligence investigation with a criminal obstruction of justice investigation related to Comey's firing. Mueller took over that investigation upon his appointment, although it was not immediately clear if he had pursued the counterintelligence angle.  Authority  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in his role as Acting Attorney General for matters related to the campaign due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appointed Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with authority to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, including exploring any links or coordination between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government; \\"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\\"; and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. ¬ß 600.4(a). As Rosenstein later informed Congress, he elected to use a Special Counsel rather than have the FBI itself oversee the investigation because did not believe acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe was the right person to lead the investigation. Instead, he would appoint a Special Counsel, as had been done in the past. U.S. Attorneys serve as special counsel, but in May 2017 there were only three Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys serving at the time, the Senate having not yet confirmed the new president's nominees, and those three had remained as holdovers from the previous administration pending the arrival of the new attorneys. As a result, Rosenstein decided to select Robert Mueller, though he was retired, because of his reputation. As special counsel, Mueller had the power to issue subpoenas, hire staff members, request funding, and prosecute federal crimes in connection with the election interference along with other crimes he may uncover. The constitutionality of indicting a sitting president remains an unsettled legal question.  Release of findings  On April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election was released to the public. The Special Counsel law requires a special counsel to confidentially provide the current attorney general with a report of findings. The attorney general, in this case William Barr, is then required to provide a summary of the findings to Congress, although he has considerable discretion in how much detail he provides. The full release of the Mueller findings to Congress and the public is not assured. Should Congress be dissatisfied with the summary it is provided, it could subpoena Mueller's full report, and, if necessary, sue in federal court. Congress could also call Mueller to testify. White House attorneys expect to preview whatever findings Barr decides to provide to Congress and the public, in order to consider asserting executive privilege to withhold the release of information gleaned from internal documents and interviews with White House officials. Commentators have noted that executive privilege cannot be invoked if the purpose is to shield wrongdoing or unlawful conduct. On March 14, 2019, the House voted 420‚Äì0 in favor of a non-binding resolution calling for the full special counsel report to be released to Congress and the public, excluding classified or grand jury information. The same day the bill was brought before the Senate for unanimous consent, but was blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham, who said it needed a clause requiring the appointment of a special counsel to investigate allegations against the 2016 Clinton campaign. On March 15, Trump stated \\"there should be no Mueller Report\\" because \\"this was an illegal & conflicted investigation.\\" Five days later he stated, \\"I told the House, 'If you want, let [the public] see it,'\\" adding, \\"that's up to the Attorney General.\\" On March 25, 2019, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by minority leader Chuck Schumer for the Senate to take up the same resolution approved by the House eleven days earlier. The special counsel delivered its report to Attorney General Barr on March 22, 2019. Two days later, on March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter of the report to Congress, describing the conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and obstruction of justice. Barr said the report would be delivered to Congress by mid-April, with some redactions of any information that would \\"potentially compromise sources and methods\\" or \\"unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties\\". A two-volume redacted version of the full report was publicly released on April 18, 2019. A less- redacted version of the report will eventually provided to a limited number of members of Congress. == Grand juries == On August 3, 2017, Mueller empaneled a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of his investigation. The grand jury has the power to subpoena documents, require witnesses to testify under oath, and issue indictments for targets of criminal charges if probable cause is found. The Washingtonian grand jury is separate from an earlier Virginian grand jury investigating Michael Flynn; the Flynn case has been absorbed into Mueller's overall investigation. The grand jury has issued subpoenas to those involved in the Trump Tower meeting held on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, which was also the location of Trump's presidential campaign headquarters. * Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born lobbyist and former Soviet Army officer, a participant in the Donald Trump Jr. meeting, testified under oath for several hours on August 11, 2017. * Jason Maloni, spokesman for Paul Manafort, testified under oath for more than two hours on September 15, 2017. Maloni was employed by Manafort following the five months he served as Chairman of Trump's campaign for president in 2016, to answer questions about Manafort's involvement in Trump's campaign. * Sam Clovis testified during the week of August 23, 2017. * Carter Page * George Nader, Lebanese-American businessman who advises UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, testified during the week preceding March 5, 2018. NBC News reported on August 25, 2017, that \\"in recent days\\" the grand jury subpoenaed witness testimony from the executives of six public relations firms, who worked with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on lobbying efforts in Ukraine. On January 16, 2018, The New York Times reported that Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by Mueller to testify before the standing grand jury in Washington, DC. Reuters and CNN reported the next day that Bannon had struck a deal with Mueller's team to be interviewed by prosecutors instead of testifying before the grand jury. On February 15, 2018, multiple sources reported that those interviews had taken place over several days that week. TMZ reported that Kristin M. Davis, the \\"Manhattan Madam\\" who had previously worked for Roger Stone, was subpoenaed in June 2018. On August 10, 2018, a federal judge found Stone's former aide Andrew Miller to be in contempt of court for refusing to testify before the grand jury. Also that day, the Mueller investigation subpoenaed Randy Credico, whom Stone had described as his \\"backchannel\\" to Julian Assange. The Wall Street Journal reported on November 14, 2018, that Mueller's investigators are examining whether Stone engaged in witness tampering by intimidating Credico into supporting Stone's assertions. Jerome Corsi, former Washington bureau chief of Infowars, was subpoenaed to appear on September 7, 2018, before a Mueller grand jury. Corsi's attorney said he expected his client to be asked about his association with Roger Stone, who had appeared to know in advance that WikiLeaks would release damaging information about the Clinton campaign. == Legal teams == Robert Mueller was appointed in May 2017 as special counsel. The investigation involves multiple legal teams, specifically the attorneys, supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, taking part in the investigation; the team defending President Trump in his personal capacity; and the team representing the White House as an institution separate from the President. According to CNN, as of August 2018, the prosecution team includes 15 attorneys, led by Mueller. The additional supporting staff brings the number over 30. There have been few reported departures from Mueller's team. The defense has two components: Emmet Flood representing the White House, and a team representing Trump personally, including Jay Sekulow, Andrew Ekonomou, Rudy Giuliani, the Raskin & Raskin law firm, and Joanna Hendon. Former members of the defense team include white-collar crimes expert John Dowd and Ty Cobb representing the office of the presidency. Mueller's legal team has been consistently attacked as biased against President Trump, who once referred to this team as \\"The 13 Angry Democrats\\". According to Politifact, while 13 of the 17 team members are indeed Democrats (the rest unaffiliated to either of the two major parties), however, Mueller himself is a registered Republican, and choosing to hire or not hire career attorneys on the basis of political affiliation is contrary to both Justice Department policy and federal law. == Changes to oversight leadership ==  Whitaker's succession  As the Mueller investigation progressed, Trump repeatedly expressed anger over Attorney General Sessions' decision to recuse. In July 2017, Trump said that Sessions should have informed him about Sessions' impending recusal before Trump even nominated him, then Trump would have nominated someone else for Attorney General. In May 2018, Trump said that he wished that he had nominated someone other than Sessions for Attorney General. In August 2018, Trump declared that Sessions' job was safe at least until the November 2018 United States midterm elections. Sessions resigned as Attorney General on November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, writing that he had resigned at Trump's request. Matthew Whitaker, who served as the Acting Attorney General from November 2018 to February 2019 With Sessions' resignation, Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, as Acting Attorney General on November 7, 2018. This meant that Whitaker assumed oversight of the Mueller investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. Previously in August 2017, one month prior to joining the Justice Department as Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker wrote an opinion column for CNN titled \\"Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far\\". He stated that Mueller's investigation is a \\"lynch mob\\", that it should be limited and should not probe into Trump's finances. Whitaker also argued in 2017 that the Trump Tower meeting was neither improper nor evidence of collusion. The New York Times reported that White House aides and other people close to Trump anticipated that Whitaker would \\"rein in\\" the investigation. Whitaker, a vocal Trump supporter, had publicly criticized the Mueller investigation on several occasions before joining the Justice Department in September 2017, asserting it was \\"going too far\\" and referring to it as a \\"lynch mob\\". Whitaker is also a personal friend of Sam Clovis, a former co-chair of the Trump campaign who has testified to Mueller's investigators and grand jury. Because of his prior statements and involvement, many Democrats and some Republicans have asserted that Whitaker's potential conflicts of interest require him to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller, although Whitaker reportedly indicated he had no intention of doing so. Justice Department ethics officials typically review conflicts of interest to recommend recusals, but their findings are not binding and are usually kept confidential.  Barr's succession  On December 7, 2018, President Trump declared that he would nominate William Barr for the vacant post of Attorney General. Barr was previously Attorney General under President George H. W. Bush. During his January 2019 confirmation hearings, Barr suggested the investigation's findings could be withheld from the public, as their release is not mandated by law. In June 2018, Barr had sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and Trump attorneys arguing that the Special Counsel's approach to potential obstruction of justice by Trump was \\"fatally misconceived\\" and that, based on his knowledge, Trump's actions were within his presidential authority. In June 2017, Barr had characterized the obstruction investigation as \\"asinine\\" and that it was \\"taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president\\". Trump stated in a February 2019 interview that he had not committed to releasing the Mueller report. On February 14, 2019, Barr was sworn in as Attorney General after the Senate approved his appointment by a 54-45 vote that day, thus gaining oversight of the Mueller investigation from Whitaker. == Topics == Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, serving as Acting Attorney General due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, authorized Mueller to investigate and prosecute \\"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\\", as well as \\"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\\" and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4 ‚Äì Jurisdiction.  Russian election interference  Internet Research Agency indictment from February 2018 In late-July 2016, the FBI opened counterintelligence investigations into four Americans who had contact with Trump to determine whether they might have coordinated or cooperated with Russia's activities. Those investigations became part of the Special Counsel's portfolio. U.S. intelligence agencies in January 2017 concluded \\"with high confidence\\" that the Russian government interfered in the election by hacking into the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarding their contents to WikiLeaks, as well as by disseminating fake news promoted on social media, and by penetrating, or trying to penetrate, the election systems and databases of multiple U.S. states. de Volkskrant reported on January 25, 2018, that Dutch intelligence agency AIVD had penetrated the Russian hacking group Cozy Bear in 2014 and in 2015 observed them hack the DNC in real time, as well as capturing the images of the hackers via a security camera in their workspace. The New York Times reported on July 18, 2018, that American, British and Dutch intelligence services had observed stolen DNC emails on Russian military intelligence networks. NBC News reported on March 1, 2018, that Mueller was assembling a case for criminal charges against Russians who carried out the hacking and leaking. Those charges were brought on July 13, 2018. Russia's influence on U.S. voters through social media is a primary focus of the Mueller investigation. Mueller used a search warrant to obtain detailed information about Russian ad purchases on Facebook. According to a former federal prosecutor, the warrant means that a judge was convinced that foreigners had illegally contributed to influencing a US election via Facebook Ads. On February 13, 2018, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the heads of the top six American intelligence agencies unanimously reaffirmed Russian interference. Three sources familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN he remains unconvinced that Russia interfered because it suggests he didn't win the election solely on his own merits. During a July 16, 2018, press conference at the 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit in Helsinki, Finland, President Putin was asked, \\"did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?\\" Putin replied, \\"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\\" The Mueller Report concluded while there was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election, the Russian government did attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor by hacking Democratic political organizations and spreading \\"disinformation and social media\\" discord.  Links between Trump associates and Russian officials  As early as spring 2015, American intelligence agencies started overhearing conversations in which Russian government officials, some within the Kremlin, discussed associates of Trump, then a presidential candidate. Michael Flynn served as the 24th United States National Security Advisor from January to February 2017 The New York Times reported on February 14, 2017, that phone records and communications intercepts showed that Trump associates‚Äîincluding members of the Trump campaign‚Äîhad \\"repeated contacts\\" with senior Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 campaign. Paul Manafort was the only Trump associate who was specifically identified as participating in these communications. In addition, some senior Trump associates, including Kushner, Trump Jr., Sessions, Flynn and Manafort, had direct contacts with Russian officials during 2016. In congressional testimony the following June, Comey stated the Times report was \\"in the main\\" not true. The Times reported that during the intervening months, its sources continued to believe the reporting was \\"solid.\\" In July 2020, the Senate Judiciary Committee released notes taken contemporaneously with the Times report by FBI Counterintelligence Division chief Peter Strzok indicating his skepticiam about the Times' reporting, writing, ‚ÄúWe have not seen evidence of any officials associated with the Trump team in contact with [intelligence officers]\\" and \\"‚ÄúWe are unaware of ANY Trump advisors engaging in conversations with Russian intelligence officials.‚Äù The Times stood by its account, subsequently reporting that the released notes did not provide a fully accurate representation of Strzok's knowledge. Michael Flynn was forced to resign as National Security Advisor on February 13, 2017, after it was revealed that on December 29, 2016, the day that Obama announced sanctions against Russia, Flynn had discussed the sanctions with Russian ambassador Kislyak. Flynn had earlier acknowledged speaking to Kislyak but denied discussing the sanctions. Also in December 2016, Flynn and presidential advisor Jared Kushner met with Kislyak hoping to set up a direct, secure line of communication with Russian officials about which American intelligence agencies would be unaware. Jared Kushner also met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB), which has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since July 2014. Flynn and Kushner failed to report these meetings on their security clearance forms. The Trump Organization pursued a luxury hotel and condominium project in Moscow‚Äîdubbed the Trump Tower Moscow‚Äîduring the Trump presidential campaign. This project was facilitated by Michael Cohen, then an attorney for the Trump Organization, and from January 2017 to May 2018 Trump's personal attorney. Trump signed a nonbinding \\"letter of intent\\" dated October 13, 2015, to proceed with the project. The letter, also signed by Russian investor Andrei Rozov, was forwarded to Cohen by Russian-American real estate developer Felix Sater, who had worked with The Trump Organization on prior deals, including Trump SoHo and Trump International Hotel & Residence. Sater has also been involved in criminal activities involving organized crime and has served as an informant to the FBI relating to those activities. He boasted to Cohen about his connections to Vladimir Putin, saying in an email to Cohen on November 13, 2015, \\"Buddy our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putins [sic] team to buy in on this. I will manage this process.\\" He also asserted that he had secured financing for the project through the Russian state-owned VTB Bank, which was under sanctions by the United States government. Cohen emailed Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in January 2016 to request assistance in advancing the project and later stated he didn't recall receiving a response. Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that the deal was abandoned in January 2016, but in November 2018 admitted in a guilty plea that he had minimized Trump's role in the plans \\"to be consistent with [Trump's] political messaging\\" and that negotiations had actually extended through June 2016. Cohen also admitted that Peskov's office had, in fact, replied to his January 2016 email and discussed the deal with him on the phone. In a sentencing memorandum filed the day after his guilty plea, Cohen's attorneys stated he kept Trump \\"apprised\\" of the \\"substantive conversation\\" Cohen had with the Russian official, and discussed with Trump traveling to Russia to advance the project during the summer of 2016. BuzzFeed News reported on March 12, 2018, that Mueller's investigators had questioned Sater, and on April 13, 2018, reported that a former Russian spy had helped secure financing for the project. In 2010, Sater was provided business cards describing himself as \\"Senior Advisor to Donald Trump\\" with an email address at TrumpOrg.com. In a 2013 sworn affidavit, Trump said \\"If [Sater] were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,\\" and in 2015 he stated \\"Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it. I'm not that familiar with him.\\" The Trump team issued multiple denials of any contacts between Trump associates and Russia, but many of those denials turned out to be false. On December 4, 2017, in a court filing requesting that the judge revoke Manafort's bond agreement, prosecutors stated that Paul Manafort had worked with a Russian intelligence official to draft an op-ed essay while he was out on bail. Rick Gates at the 2016 Republican National Convention The New York Times reported, on March 28, 2018, that former Trump campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates had, in September and October 2016, frequently communicated with a man that the FBI believes is a former agent of GRU, Russia's largest foreign intelligence agency, and who had maintained active links with Russian intelligence during these communications; this disclosure was written into a court sentencing document for Alex van der Zwaan, submitted by Robert Mueller. Identified in the document as \\"Person A\\", The Times reported that the man matched the description of Konstantin Kilimnik, who, for years, was Paul Manafort's \\"right-hand man\\" in Ukraine. Gates reportedly told an associate that he knew \\"Person A\\" was a former GRU agent, although Manafort told associates he was not aware of such a connection. The Times reported on January 8, 2019, that in spring 2016 Gates and Manafort gave polling data, some of which was private to the Trump campaign, to Kilimnik, asking he pass it to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov. During a closed-door court hearing on February 4, 2019, regarding false statements Manafort had made to investigators about his communications with Kilimnik, special counsel prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told judge Amy Berman Jackson that \\"This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating,\\" suggesting that Mueller's office continued to examine a possible agreement between Russia and the Trump campaign. Reuters reported on March 29, 2018, that the special counsel is examining an event at the 2016 Republican National Convention at which Jeff Sessions had conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Investigators are also looking into how and why language deemed hostile to Russia was removed from the Republican party's platform document during the convention. Mueller's office is also inquiring whether Sessions had private conversations with Kislyak at a Trump speech at the Mayflower Hotel in April 2016. The Steele dossier asserted that Trump attorney Michael Cohen in August 2016 had a clandestine meeting with Kremlin representatives in Prague. Cohen has stated he has never been to Prague, inviting investigators to examine his passport. McClatchy reported on April 13, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have evidence that in August or early September 2016 Cohen traveled to Prague by way of Germany. Such a trip would not have required a passport as Germany and the Czech Republic are in the Schengen Area which has abolished passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. On April 14, 2018, Cohen again denied he had ever been to Prague, although weeks after the 2016 election he had told journalist David Corn he had been in Prague fourteen years earlier. McClatchy reported in December 2018 that a mobile phone traced to Cohen had \\"pinged\\" cellphone towers around Prague in late summer 2016. McClatchy also reported that during that time an eastern European intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Russians, one of whom mentioned that Cohen was in Prague. The Mueller Report did not conclude Cohen had been in Prague, citing his testimony to investigators.Mueller Report, vol.2, p.139 Carter Page on Hardball with Chris Matthews On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted version of the October 2016 FISA warrant application for Carter Page, which stated in part \\"The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government\\" and \\"the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign.\\" The application also stated The Steele dossier asserted that Page had secretly met \\"senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN\\" in Moscow on \\"either 7 or 8 July\\" of 2016, while Page was still officially with the Trump campaign, but did not refer to any kompromat.  Alleged collusion between Trump campaign and Russian agents   2016  Trump Tower, Manhattan, site of the meeting on June 9, 2016 Mueller investigated the meeting on June 9, 2016, in Trump Tower in New York City between three senior members of Trump's presidential campaign‚ÄîKushner, Manafort, and Donald Trump Jr.‚Äîand at least five other people, including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Rinat Akhmetshin, a lobbyist and former Soviet army officer who met senior Trump campaign aides, Ike Kaveladze, British publicist Rob Goldstone, and translator Anatoli Samochornov. Goldstone had suggested the meeting to Trump Jr., and it was arranged in a series of emails later made public. In one email exchange of June 3, 2016, Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. that Aras Agalarov \\"offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father\\", adding that it was \\"very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump\\" that he could send to Donald Trump's assistant Rhona Graff. Trump Jr. responded minutes later \\"Thanks Rob I appreciate that\\" and \\"if it's what you say I love it.\\" Trump Jr. initially told the press that the meeting was held to discuss adoptions of Russian children by Americans, but after contrary media reports he added that he agreed to the meeting with the understanding that he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton. Mueller's team investigated the emails and the meeting, and whether President Trump later tried to hide the meeting's purpose. On July 18, 2017, Kaveladze's attorney said that Mueller's investigators were seeking information about the meeting in June 2016 from his client, and on July 21, Mueller asked the White House to preserve all documents related to the meeting. It has been reported that Manafort had made notes during the meeting. CNN reported on July 26, 2018, that anonymous sources stated that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell the Mueller investigation that Trump was aware of and approved of the June 9, 2016, meeting in advance, which Trump and Trump Jr. have repeatedly denied. CNN reported in the same story that Cohen attorney Lanny Davis had declined to comment for the report. The following day, The Washington Post reported a similar story coming from one anonymous source, although the paper did not specifically mention Russians. One month later, Davis identified himself as that source, clarifying that he could not be certain of Cohen's knowledge in the matter. Davis also asserted he had been a source for the CNN story. A CNN spokeswoman stated, \\"We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.\\" CNN reported on March 23, 2017, that the FBI was examining \\"human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings\\" indicating that Trump associates may have coordinated with \\"suspected Russian operatives\\" to release information damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign.  2017  By August 3, 2017, Mueller had impaneled a grand jury in the District of Columbia that issued subpoenas concerning the meeting. The Financial Times reported on August 31 that Akhmetshin had given sworn testimony to Mueller's grand jury. CNN reported on September 19, 2017, that Manafort had been a target of a FISA wiretap both before and after the 2016 election, extending into early 2017. Some of the intercepted communications caused concerns among investigators that Manafort had solicited assistance from Russians for the campaign, although the evidence was reportedly inconclusive. The wiretaps began sometime after Manafort became a subject of an FBI investigation into his business practices in 2014. The Mueller investigation was provided details of these intercepts. Mueller is investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Republican activist Peter W. Smith, who stated that he tried to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers, and that he was acting on behalf of Michael Flynn and other senior Trump campaign members. Trump campaign officials have denied that Smith was working with them. In fall 2017, Mueller's team interviewed former Government Communications Headquarters cybersecurity researcher Matt Tait, who had been approached by Smith to verify the authenticity of emails allegedly hacked from Clinton's private email server. Tait reportedly told House Intelligence Committee investigators in October 2017 that he believed Smith had ties to members of Trump's inner circle‚Äîincluding Flynn, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway‚Äîand may have been helping build opposition research for the Trump campaign. Smith committed suicide in May 2017, several days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his alleged efforts. Aged 81 and reportedly in failing health, he left a carefully prepared file of documents, including a statement police called a suicide note. An attorney for Smith's estate said in October 2017 that some of Smith's documents had been turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 7, 2018, that Smith had raised at least $100,000 from donors in his pursuit of the Clinton emails, that his estate had provided documents to the Mueller investigation, and that associates of Smith had been questioned by Mueller's investigators or a grand jury. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 10, 2018, that Smith had established a \\"professional relationship\\" with Flynn as early as 2015, and during the campaign was using Flynn's contacts to assist with his search for the Clinton emails. The Journal reported on October 19, 2018, that the Mueller investigation has evidence Smith may have had prior knowledge of the Guccifer 2.0 hacks. The Mueller report later confirmed significant aspects of Smith's efforts to locate the Clinton emails, including his communications about it with Flynn and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, as well as Flynn's actions to spearhead the effort at Trump's repeated requests.Mueller report, vol.I, p.62 In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed he had advised investigators that members of the Trump campaign had discussed whether to contact WikiLeaks about the release of emails. In December 2017, it was reported that the Mueller investigation was examining whether the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, who worked together on the digital arm of Trump's campaign, provided assistance to Russian trolls attempting to influence voters.  2018  Yahoo News reported that Mueller's team was examining whether the joint RNC‚ÄìTrump campaign data operation‚Äîwhich was directed on Trump's side by Brad Parscale and managed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner‚Äîwas related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the U.S. electorate. Also that month, the Democratic ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees asked their respective Republican chairmen to subpoena two of the data firms hired by Trump's campaign for documents related to Russia's election interference, including the firm headed by Parscale. On February 27, 2018, Trump selected Parscale to serve as campaign manager on his 2020 reelection campaign. NBC News reported on February 28, 2018, that Mueller's investigators asked witnesses pointed questions about whether Trump was aware that Democratic emails had been stolen before that was publicly known, and whether he was involved in their strategic release. This is the first reported indication that Mueller's investigation is specifically examining whether Trump was personally involved in collusive activities. Julian Assange, editor of WikiLeaks Mueller's investigators also asked about the relationship between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and why Trump took policy positions favorable to Russia. Stone, a longtime Republican \\"dirty trickster\\" and Trump confidant repeatedly discussed his backchannel communications with Assange and claimed knowledge of forthcoming leaks from Wikileaks. He also exchanged Twitter private messages with Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence connected to two Russian intelligence groups that cybersecurity analysts have concluded hacked Democratic National Committee emails. The New York Times reported on November 1, 2018, that Stone and Steve Bannon exchanged emails in October 2016 about Assange's intent to release documents, and that Bannon and other former senior Trump campaign officials told Mueller's investigators of Stone's assertions that he was a conduit to Wikileaks and seemed aware of imminent document releases, although the \\"top tier\\" of the campaign was skeptical of Stone's claims. Reuters reported on May 16, 2018, that Mueller's office subpoenaed Stone's social media strategist, Jason Sullivan, the prior week to testify before a grand jury on May 18 and to provide documents, objects and electronically stored information. Reuters reported the next day that John Kakanis, Stone's driver, accountant and operative, was also subpoenaed. Investigators also focused on Trump's public comments in July 2016 asking Russia to find emails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton's private email server. At a news conference on July 27, 2016, days after WikiLeaks began publishing the Democratic National Committee emails, Trump said, \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\\" The July 13, 2018, indictment of 12 Russian GRU agents described After a \\"testy March 5 meeting, Mueller's team agreed to provide the president's lawyers with more specific information about the subjects that prosecutors wished to discuss with the president\\". Then Jay Sekulow \\"compiled a list of 49 questions that the team believed the president would be asked... The New York Times first reported the existence of the list.\\" On April 30, 2018, The New York Times published a list of interview questions for Trump that the Mueller investigation had provided to the president's attorneys. The list was provided to The Times by an individual outside Trump's legal team. Among the questions was, \\"What knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?\\" Before this disclosure, there had been no publicly available information indicating any such outreach. The Times noted that the questions were not quoted verbatim and in some cases were condensed. Written responses to some of the questions were provided to the Mueller investigation on November 20, 2018. The New York Times reported on May 15, 2018, that Trump campaign policy aide and later White House Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Mashburn testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2018 that he recalled receiving an email from George Papadopoulos in the first half of 2016 indicating that the Russian government had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Before this report, there had been no publicly available information indicating that Papadopoulos had informed anyone on the Trump campaign about such matters. Despite an extensive search for the purported email by various investigators, it has not been located. A court document Mueller's office filed in association with Papadopoulos's guilty plea included verbatim quotes from various emails Papadopoulos had sent or received, but the Mashburn email was not referenced in that document.  2019  On March 22, 2019, the Special Counsel submitted their report to Attorney General William Barr. The investigation garnered 199 criminal charges, 37 indictments or guilty pleas, and 5 prison sentences. On March 24, 2019, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress detailing the special counsel's findings. The letter was split into 2 sections: The first section discusses Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the second section details whether Trump obstructed justice.  Potential obstruction of justice  James Comey, former Director of the FBI Shortly before firing him, Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into a member of the Trump Campaign, former National Security Advisor Flynn. In March, Trump reportedly discussed the FBI's Russia investigation with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and then CIA Director Mike Pompeo (who is currently serving as Secretary of State as of April 26, 2018), and asked if they could intervene with Comey to limit or stop it. When he was asked at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about the report, Coats said he would not discuss conversations he had with the president but \\"I have never felt pressured to intervene in the Russia investigation in any way.\\" Before being appointed Director of National Intelligence by Trump, Coats had been an elected Republican politician since 1981, serving in both the House and Senate. In a May 2017 interview with NBC News anchorman Lester Holt, Trump stated he was thinking of \\"this Russia thing\\" when he decided to fire FBI Director James Comey. Trump's statement raised concerns of potential obstruction of justice. In May 2018 Trump denied firing Comey because of the Russia investigation. In August 2018 Trump tweeted that \\"Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia\\", followed by his attorney Jay Sekulow asserting in September 2018 that NBC had edited the Trump interview. Neither Trump nor Sekulow produced evidence that the tape had been modified. In February 2017, it was reported that White House officials had asked the FBI to issue a statement that there had been no contact between Trump associates and Russian intelligence sources during the 2016 campaign. The FBI did not make the requested statement, and observers noted that the request violated established procedures about contact between the White House and the FBI regarding pending investigations. After Comey revealed in March that the FBI was investigating the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump phoned Coats and Director of National Security Admiral Michael S. Rogers and asked them to publicly state there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Both Coats and Rogers believed that the request was inappropriate, though not illegal, and did not make the requested statement. The two exchanged notes about the incident, and Rogers made a contemporary memo to document the request. The White House effort to push back publicly on the Russia probe reportedly also included requests to senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia, including Senator Richard Burr and Representative Devin Nunes, the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, respectively. FBI Director Comey memo In May 2017, it was reported that Comey took contemporaneous notes immediately after an Oval Office conversation with Trump on February 14, 2017, in which Trump is described as attempting to persuade Comey to drop the FBI investigation into Flynn. The memo notes that Trump said, \\"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\\" Comey made no commitments to Trump on the subject. The White House denied the version of events in the memo, but an FBI agent's contemporaneous notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations. In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, Comey gave a detailed report on the February 14 conversation, including Trump's suggestion that he should \\"let go\\" the Flynn investigation. Comey said he \\"took it as a direction‚Ä¶ I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.\\" He added that it was \\"a very disturbing thing, very concerning\\", and that he discussed the incident with other FBI leaders, including whether an obstruction of justice investigation should be opened. Comey created similar memos about all nine conversations he had with the president. Mueller's office has the Comey memos, but on February 2, 2018, a federal judge denied multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to make the documents public, at least for now. The FBI launched an investigation of Trump for obstruction of justice a few days after the May 9 firing of Comey. The special prosecutor's office took over the obstruction of justice investigation and has reportedly interviewed Director of National Intelligence Coats, Director of the National Security Agency Rogers, and Deputy Director of the NSA Richard Ledgett. ABC News reported in June that Mueller was gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation had not been launched. On June 16, Trump tweeted: \\"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.\\" However, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow said Trump's tweet was referring to the June 14 Washington Post report that he was under investigation for obstruction of justice, and that Trump has not actually been notified of any investigation. The New York Times and Los Angeles Times reported on September 20, 2017, that Mueller's office had requested information from the White House regarding an Oval Office meeting President Trump had with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on May 10, 2017, during which Trump reportedly said that firing Comey had relieved \\"great pressure\\" on him. On January 23, 2018, The Washington Post reported that Robert Mueller sought to question President Donald Trump about the Flynn and Comey departures. The Washington Post also reported on January 23, 2018, that Mueller's office is interested in a May 2017 Oval Office conversation between Trump and Andrew McCabe, days after McCabe had automatically become acting director of the FBI when Trump dismissed Comey, allegedly for not pledging loyalty to the president. During this conversation, Trump reportedly asked McCabe for whom he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. McCabe, a lifelong Republican, replied that he had not voted in that election. On January 24, 2018, Trump denied‚Äîor did not remember‚Äîasking McCabe about his vote. Like Comey, McCabe also took contemporaneous notes of his conversations with Trump, which are reportedly now in the possession of Mueller's office. The New York Times reported on January 23, 2018, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned the preceding week by Mueller's investigators. Trump previously expressed frustration that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation and not prevented a Special Counsel from being appointed, stating that he would not have appointed Sessions had he known that would happen. Multiple episodes have been reported in which Trump has threatened to dismiss Sessions, or Sessions has tendered his resignation. The Washington Post reported on February 28, 2018, that the Mueller investigation has been examining a period of time during the summer of 2017 when Trump seemed determined to drive Sessions from his job, to determine \\"whether those efforts were part of a months-long pattern of attempted obstruction of justice\\". Sessions' departure would allow Trump to appoint another attorney general who is not restrained by recusal. The New York Times reported on May 29, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is examining a previously unreported March 2017 episode when Trump attempted to persuade Sessions to reverse his recusal, suggesting that the investigation into possible obstruction of justice was broader than previously understood. The questions Mueller's office had previously provided Trump's attorneys for an interview with the president included, \\"What efforts did you make to try to get [Sessions] to change his mind [about recusal]?\\" USA Today and The New York Times reported on January 31, 2018, that Mueller's office is expected to question Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for President Trump's legal team, about his reported concerns that the president and his longtime aide Hope Hicks might have sought to obstruct justice. Corallo reportedly plans to tell investigators that Hicks told President Trump on a conference call that the Trump Jr. emails regarding his meeting with Russians \\"will never get out\\". Hicks' attorney denied the allegation. Mueller's investigators reportedly interviewed Hicks in early December 2017. Corallo had resigned from the Trump team in July 2017, reportedly because he became concerned that the president had obstructed justice. Bloomberg News reported on March 12, 2018, that the obstruction of justice aspect of the investigation is near completion and that Mueller may set it aside to conclude other aspects, such as collusion and hacking. Superseding indictment of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates alleging tax evasion and bank fraud The New York Times reported on March 28, 2018, that in 2017, as the Mueller investigation was building its cases against Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, former Trump attorney John M. Dowd broached the idea of presidential pardons of the men with their attorneys. The Times reported this might have indicated concerns by Trump's legal team about what the men might reveal to investigators if they agreed to cooperate with the investigation in exchange for leniency. Although legal opinions vary as to whether this discussion alone would constitute obstruction of justice, prosecutors might present it as part of a pattern of activity that points to a conspiracy to thwart the investigation. CBS News reported on March 28, 2018, that Manafort is declining a plea deal and proceeding to trial because he is expecting a pardon from Trump, citing \\"legal sources with knowledge of his strategy\\". In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed that he advised investigators that both before and after his guilty plea \\"he or his attorneys received communications from persons connected to the Administration or Congress that could have affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation.\\" In a January 2018 letter to Mueller, Trump's attorneys asserted that Trump cannot unlawfully obstruct justice because the Constitution grants him full authority over all federal investigations and he can \\"if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon\\". Trump requested and received the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions the day after the 2018 midterm elections, following months of criticizing Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, stating in July 2017, \\"if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\\" Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff since September 2017, as Acting Attorney General. While Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff, White House chief of staff John Kelly described him as the West Wing's \\"eyes and ears\\" in the DOJ, which Trump considered hostile to him. Prior to joining the Justice Department, Whitaker had publicly criticized the Mueller investigation on several occasions, asserting it was \\"going too far\\", referring to it as a \\"lynch mob\\", and suggested it could be impeded by cutting its budget. Trump had seen Whitaker's supportive commentaries on CNN during the summer of 2017 and that July Whitaker was interviewed by White House counsel Don McGahn to join the Trump legal team as an \\"attack dog\\" against Mueller. During an interview with The Daily Caller on November 14, 2018, Trump was asked who he might be considering to assume the permanent attorney general position, mentioning Whitaker. Unprompted, Trump stated, \\"as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought...It's an illegal investigation\\". Days after Whitaker's appointment, Jerry Nadler, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asserted that Whitaker's appointment was \\"part of a pattern of obstruction\\" of the Mueller investigation and that Whitaker would be the first witness called to testify before the Committee. In an interview aired on November 18, 2018, Trump asserted he was unaware of Whitaker's previous criticisms of the Mueller investigation, later referring to one of Whitaker's previous statements, saying \\"There is no collusion, he happened to be right.\\" Trump added, \\"I think he's very well aware politically. I think he's astute politically ... He's going to do what's right.\\" According to a letter from Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr, no conclusion was reached in the Mueller Report on whether or not Trump obstructed justice. As of March 24, 2019, the report itself has yet to be released. In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed that he advised investigators of discussions within the Trump campaign involving ‚Äúpotential efforts to interfere with the [special counsel's] investigation.‚Äù  Financial investigations  Prosecution's statement of Michael Flynn's offense The Special Counsel investigation expanded to include Trump's and his associates' financial ties to Russia. The FBI is reviewing the financial records of Trump himself, The Trump Organization, Trump's family members, and his campaign staff, including Trump's real estate activities, which had been under federal scrutiny before the campaign. According to CNN, financial crimes may be easier for investigators to prove than any crimes stemming directly from collusion with Russia. Campaign staff whose finances are under investigation include Manafort, Flynn, Carter Page, and Trump's son- in-law Jared Kushner. At a New York real estate conference in September 2008, Donald Trump Jr. stated: \\"And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\\" McClatchy reported on April 6, 2018, that Mueller's investigators that week arrived unannounced at the home of an unnamed business associate of the Trump Organization who had worked on foreign deals for the company in recent years. The investigators had warrants for electronic records and to compel sworn testimony, and were reported to be particularly interested in transactions involving Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. Transactions under investigation include Russian purchases of Trump apartments, a SoHo development with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, transactions with the Bank of Cyprus, real estate financing organized by Kushner, and Trump's sale of a Florida mansion for $30 million over its appraised value to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev. The special counsel team has contacted Deutsche Bank, which is the main banking institution doing business with The Trump Organization. The Wall Street Journal reported on December 6, 2017, that Deutsche Bank received a subpoena from Mueller's office earlier that fall concerning people or entities affiliated with President Trump. The original Journal story incorrectly reported that Trump's records had been subpoenaed, which The New York Times reported on April 10, 2018 prompted Trump to tell his advisers \\"in no uncertain terms\\" that the Mueller investigation must be shut down, before Mueller's office advised his attorneys the report was inaccurate. Jared Kushner, former CEO of Kushner Properties and senior advisor to President Trump Kushner Properties‚Äîfrom which Jared Kushner resigned as CEO in early 2017 to serve as a senior advisor in the Trump White House‚Äîpurchased the office tower located at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in 2007, just before Manhattan real estate prices fell in the Great Recession. The property has since experienced financial difficulties that the company has been attempting to resolve with new financing, without success, before the property's $1.2 billion mortgage comes due in February 2019. This effort has reportedly been complicated by Trump's election, which has caused potential lenders to avoid appearances of conflicts of interest. The matter has raised the interest of investigators who are looking at Kushner's December 2016 meeting with Sergei Gorkov, who said in a statement issued by his bank that he met with Kushner in his capacity as the then-chief executive of Kushner Properties, while Kushner assured Congress in a July 24, 2017, statement that the meeting did not involve \\"any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind\\". CNN reported on February 20, 2018, that Mueller's investigation has expanded beyond Kushner's contacts with Russia and now includes his efforts to secure financing for Kushner Properties from other foreign investors during the presidential transition. Kushner Properties sold the 666 Fifth Avenue building in summer 2018. Mueller took over an existing money laundering investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Manafort. On October 30, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his associate Rick Gates on charges including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, being an unregistered agent of foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, and false statements. Manafort's financial activities are also being investigated by the Senate and House intelligence committees, the New York Attorney General, and the Manhattan District Attorney. The Special Counsel will be able to access Trump's tax returns, which has \\"especially disturbed\\" Trump according to The Washington Post. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, as presidential candidates normally do, has been politically controversial since his presidential campaign. The Special Counsel is also investigating whether the Central Bank of Russia's deputy governor, Aleksandr Torshin, illegally funneled money through the National Rifle Association to benefit Trump's campaign. On May 16, 2018, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report stating it had obtained \\"a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign\\" through Torshin and his assistant Mariia Butina, and that \\"The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump's campaign.\\" The NRA reported spending $30 million to support the Trump campaign‚Äîtriple what they devoted to backing Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Most of that money was spent by an arm of the NRA that is not required to disclose its donors. Torshin, a lifetime NRA member, reportedly sought to broker a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in May 2016, but was rebuffed by Kushner. Torshin claims to have met with Trump at a Nashville NRA event in April 2015; he tweeted about the encounter in August, saying that Trump is \\"a proponent of traditional family values\\". Torshin spoke with Donald Trump Jr. during a gala event at the NRA's national gathering in Kentucky in May 2016, which Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan Futerfas characterized as \\"all gun-related small talk\\". Spanish authorities have implicated Torshin in money laundering and have described him as a \\"godfather\\" in Taganskaya, a major Russian criminal organization. On July 14, 2018, Butina was charged by the national security unit of the Justice Department with being an unregistered Russian agent who had attempted to create a backchannel of communications between American Republicans/conservatives and Russian officials by infiltrating the NRA, the National Prayer Breakfast and conservative religious organizations. On December 13, 2018, she pleaded guilty to conspiring with Torshin in this effort. The New York Times reported on July 17, 2018, that Torshin was scheduled to visit the White House in 2017, but the meeting was canceled after a national security aide noted Torshin was under investigation by Spanish authorities for money laundering. CNN reported on April 4, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have been examining whether Russian oligarchs directly or indirectly provided illegal cash donations to the Trump campaign and inauguration. Investigators were examining whether oligarchs invested in American companies or think tanks having political action committees connected to the campaign, as well as money funneled through American straw donors to the Trump campaign and inaugural fund. At least one oligarch was detained and his electronic devices searched as he arrived at a New York area airport on his private jet in early 2018; subsequent reporting by The New York Times identified the man as Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made to Michael Cohen after the election, through Columbus Nova, the American affiliate of Vekselberg's Renova Group. Another oligarch was also detained on a recent trip to the United States, but it is unclear if he was searched. Investigators reportedly have also asked a third oligarch who has not traveled to the United States to voluntarily provide documents and an interview. The New York Times reported on April 9, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is examining a $150,000 donation Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire, made in September 2015 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute appearance Trump made via video link to a conference in Kyiv. This transaction came to light in documents the Trump Organization provided to investigators pursuant to a subpoena earlier in 2018. The donation, the largest the Foundation received in 2015 other than from Trump himself, was solicited by his attorney, Michael Cohen. The Times reported that the subpoena had demanded \\"documents, emails and other communications about several Russians, including some whose names have not been publicly tied to Mr. Trump\\". Documents acquired by The New York Times in March 2019 showed that search warrants for Michael Cohen's emails were obtained by Mueller investigators in July 2017, with one warrant referencing a scheme \\"to make an illegal campaign contribution in October 2016 to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump\\". Nineteen pages of the documents relating to an \\"illegal campaign contribution scheme\\" were fully redacted.  Cohen raids  On April 9, 2018, based on a referral to United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) from the special counsel, the FBI raided the New York City office, residence, hotel suite, and safe-deposit boxes of Michael Cohen, seizing records related to several topics. The FBI seized Cohen's computers, phones, and personal financial records, including tax returns, as part of the no-knock raid on his office in 30 Rockefeller Plaza. CNN cited unnamed sources saying the search warrant was \\"very broad in terms of items sought\\" and that it included bank records. The warrant was personally approved by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and carried out by the public corruption unit of the SDNY. Geoffrey Berman, the interim head of the SDNY, was recused from the matter; a Trump appointee, he had worked as a volunteer attorney on the Trump campaign. Further, due to the sensitive nature of the raid and the attorney‚Äìclient privilege, a special \\"taint\\" team is required to review the documents to carefully separate out privileged and protected documents that may have been seized in the raid to ensure those inadmissible documents are not passed on to investigators. Legal blogger and former federal prosecutor Ken White of Popehat published a New York Times op-ed giving some background on the DOJ procedures required to approve such a raid, saying the search \\"suggests that the prosecutors believe they can convince a judge that communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen fall under the crime-fraud exception\\" of attorney-client privilege. It called the raid \\"highly dangerous\\" for both Cohen and Trump. White posted further analysis on Popehat, citing section 9-13.320 [sic] [recte 9-13.420] of the United States Attorneys' Manual, which sets the guidelines and regulations for searches of attorney premises.  Lobbyists  Tony Podesta, co-founder of the now-defunct Podesta Group In August 2017, Mueller's team issued grand jury subpoenas to officials in six firms, including lobbying firm Podesta Group and Mercury LLC with regard to activities on behalf of a public-relations campaign for a pro-Russian Ukrainian organization called European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The public relations effort was headed by Paul Manafort, and took place from 2012 to 2014. The Podesta Group is run by Tony Podesta, and Mercury LLC is headed by Vin Weber, a former GOP congressman. Mueller is investigating whether the firms violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Podesta Group announced in November 2017 that it would be permanently closing, with many of its employees moving to Cogent Strategies, a new firm founded by Podesta Group CEO Kimberley Fritts. Mueller's office later referred the matter to other federal investigators, who closed it in September 2019 without charges against Podesta or Weber.  Trump as a subject of investigation  From the beginning of his presidency Trump had requested assurances that he was not personally under investigation. FBI Director Comey told him so privately on three occasions but refused to make a public comment to that effect. In his letter dismissing Comey, Trump thanked Comey for \\"informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation\\". Comey later confirmed that this was true. In March 2018, Mueller's office reportedly informed Trump's attorneys that the president is not a \\"criminal target\\" but remains a \\"subject\\" of the continuing investigation. Trump's advisers were reported to be split in their interpretation of this, with some believing it was an indication that his legal exposure was low, while others expressed concern that Mueller was inducing him to agree to a personal interview, which his attorneys have discouraged him from doing for fear he might perjure himself and thus change his status from subject to target. The Post reported that Mueller also advised the attorneys that he is \\"preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice\\". The Post referenced Justice Department guidelines, which explain: Trump told reporters on January 24, 2018, that he was \\"looking forward\\" to testifying under oath to the Mueller investigation, perhaps in \\"two or three weeks\\", but added that it was \\"subject to my lawyers and all of that\\". The Wall Street Journal reported on February 25, 2018, that Trump's lawyers are considering ways for him to testify, provided the questions he faces are limited in scope and do not test his recollections in ways that amount to a potential perjury trap. Among options they are considering are providing written answers to Mueller's questions and having the president give limited face-to-face testimony. The Washington Post reported on March 19, 2018, that Trump's attorneys provided Mueller's office \\"written descriptions that chronicle key moments under investigation in hopes of curtailing the scope of a presidential interview.\\" In May 2018, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Politico that Mueller's team has rejected the proposal of providing a written testimony instead of an oral interview. Trump ultimately was not personally interviewed by the special counsel. In November 2018 he said he was preparing written answers to a set of questions, and in late November his legal team said he had submitted answers to the counsel's written questions about \\"issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry.\\"  Other topics  The Intercept reported on March 2, 2018, that Jared Kushner and his father Charles Kushner made a proposal to Qatar's finance minister, Ali Sharif Al Emadi, in April 2017 to secure investment into 666 5th Avenue asset in his family's company's portfolio, when his request was not fulfilled, a group of Middle Eastern countries, with Jared Kushner's backing, initiated a diplomatic assault that culminated in a blockade of Qatar. Kushner specifically undermined the efforts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to bring an end to the standoff. The New York Times reported on March 3, 2018, that the Mueller investigation had been examining possible efforts by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to buy political influence by directing money to the Trump campaign. Investigators had recently interviewed Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and other witnesses, about this matter. Nader was reportedly a frequent White House visitor during 2017 and investigators have inquired about any policymaking role he may have had. Investigators have examined a meeting around January 11, 2017, in the Seychelles that was convened by the UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (known as \\"MBZ\\"), which Nader attended. Also present at that meeting were Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, who is close to Vladimir Putin; and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a major Trump donor and an informal advisor to the Trump transition. UAE officials reportedly believed that Prince was representing the Trump transition and Dmitriev was representing Putin. The Mueller report later found that Nader had represented Prince to Dmitriev as \\"designated by Steve [Bannon] to meet you! I know him and he is very very well connected and trusted by the New Team,\\" while Prince \\"acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team,\\" although Bannon told investigators that Prince had not informed him of the Dmitriev meeting in advance. Prince testified to the House Intelligence Committee that \\"I didn't fly there to meet any Russian guy,\\" although the Mueller report found that he and Nader made significant preparations to meet Dmitriev. Although Prince characterized a second meeting between him and Dmitriev in a hotel bar as a chance encounter of no consequence, the meeting was actually pre-arranged after Prince had learned from calls back home that Russia had moved an aircraft carrier off Libya and he wanted to convey that the United States would not accept any Russian involvement in Libya.Mueller report, vol.1, p.151 An aircraft owned by Andrei Skoch‚Äîa Russian billionaire subject to U.S. sanctions‚Äîarrived in the Seychelles a day before Prince himself did. The Washington Post had reported on April 3, 2017, that American, European and Arab officials said the Seychelles meeting was \\"part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President- elect Donald Trump\\". Prince denied in November 30, 2017, House Intelligence Committee testimony that he had represented the Trump transition or that the meeting involved any back-channel. The Washington Post reported on March 7, 2018, that Mueller has gathered evidence that contradicts Prince, and ABC News reported on April 6, 2018, that Nader had met with Prince at a Manhattan hotel days before the Seychelles meeting and later provided him with biographical information about Dmitriev. CNN reported on March 6, 2018, that Nader had been detained and questioned by the FBI at Dulles International Airport as he returned from a trip abroad on January 17, 2018. Agents with search warrants copied the contents of Nader's electronic devices and served him with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury on January 19. CNN also reported that Nader had attended a December 2016 meeting in New York attended by MBZ; UAE ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba; and at least three Trump senior associates: Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner. The Wall Street Journal reported on April 2, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have inquired about the work done by a private consulting company, Wikistrat, on behalf of the UAE. One of the firm's co-founders, Joel Zamel, has reportedly been asked about his work with certain clients and his business relationship with George Nader. The Journal reported that, like Nader, Zamel had tried to forge a relationship with the new Trump administration. The New York Times reported on April 4, 2018, that Nader has a history of dealings with Russia dating back to at least 2012, when he brokered a $4.2 billion arms deal between Russia and Iraq, and attended an invitation-only conference in Moscow organized by close associates of Vladimir Putin. Nader has reportedly traveled frequently to Russia on behalf of the UAE, accompanying MBZ on many of those trips, and has had his photo taken with Putin. Nader has reportedly received at least partial immunity for his cooperation with the Mueller investigation. The Times also reported that Joel Zamel had been stopped at Reagan International Airport in February 2018, had his electronic devices briefly seized, and later testified before the Mueller grand jury about his relationship with Nader. The New York Times reported on May 19, 2018, that Trump Jr. met with Nader, Prince and Zamel in Trump Tower on August 3, 2016. Nader reportedly told Trump Jr. the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the election. According to Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan Futerfas, Zamel pitched a social media manipulation campaign from his Israeli company Psy-Group, although Zamel's attorney Marc Mukasey denied this. Trump Jr. reportedly responded favorably according to one source, although Futerfas denied this. Nader subsequently had frequent meetings with Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner. After Trump's election, Nader paid Zamel a large sum of money of up to $2 million. The Times reported that Prince had arranged the August 2016 meeting; Prince had stated in his November 30, 2017, testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that he had no formal communications or contact, nor any unofficial role, with the Trump campaign. The Times reported on October 8, 2018, that sometime after March 2016 Rick Gates had solicited Psy- Group to present proposals for social media manipulation and opposition research against Trump's primary opponents and Hillary Clinton. Gates reportedly was uninterested in the Psy-Group proposals, as social media strategy was being developed inside the Trump campaign, and there is no evidence the Trump campaign pursued the Psy-Group proposals. The Mueller investigation obtained copies of the proposals and questioned Psy-Group employees. Axios reported on March 4, 2018, that it had seen a grand jury subpoena that Mueller's office sent to a witness in February 2018. Axios did not name the witness. The subpoena reportedly demands all communications, from November 1, 2015, to date, that the witness sent or received \\"regarding\\" Trump; Carter Page; Corey Lewandowski; Hope Hicks; Keith Schiller; Michael Cohen; Paul Manafort; Rick Gates; Roger Stone; and Steve Bannon. A subsequent report by NBC News stated that the subpoena also encompasses \\"work papers, telephone logs, and other documents\\". On March 5, 2018, the witness was identified as Sam Nunberg, who served as a communications consultant on the Trump campaign until August 2, 2015, and later as an informal adviser. Nunberg stated that he had been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury on March 9, 2018, but he would refuse to appear or provide any of the subpoenaed documents. After multiple defiant television appearances on March 5, 2018, Nunberg indicated the next day that he planned to comply with the subpoena. The New Yorker reported on March 5, 2018, that Christopher Steele spoke with Mueller's investigators in September 2017. The magazine asserted that Steele discussed another document he had authored in November 2016‚Äîafter the Steele dossier‚Äîthat describes discussions \\"a senior Russian official\\" had heard inside the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: that the Kremlin had asked Trump \\"through unspecified channels\\" to not appoint Mitt Romney as Secretary of State. As a presidential candidate in 2012, Romney described Russia as \\"our number one geopolitical foe\\". After publicly considering Romney as Secretary of State, Trump ultimately selected Rex Tillerson, who has a long history of business dealings in Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin in 2013. Senate Finance Committee report on Michael Cohen's financial crimes and dealings with Novartis The Washington Post reported on March 6, 2018, that Mueller's office had requested documents and interviewed witnesses regarding activities of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer. Investigators are reported to be interested in at least two episodes relating to Russian interests, including the proposed construction of Trump Tower Moscow and \\"a Russia-friendly peace proposal for Ukraine that was delivered to Cohen by an Ukrainian lawmaker one week after Trump took office\\". The New York Times reported, on January 10, 2019, that Mueller investigators, and other federal prosecutors, were investigating the activities of over a dozen Russia-aligned Ukrainian political and business figures who attended the Trump inauguration, ostensibly promoting a pro-Russian \\"peace plan\\" for Ukraine that included the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Andrey Artemenko, a Ukrainian politician who attended the Trump inaugural, was interviewed by the FBI and the Mueller grand jury, having met, days after the inaugural, with Trump attorney Michael Cohen and former Trump business associate Felix Sater, in New York, to present a proposal. Cohen hand- delivered Artemenko's proposal to Michael Flynn one week before Flynn resigned as national security advisor. The New York Times reported on March 7, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is aware of conversations Trump had with two witnesses regarding their testimony with investigators. In one conversation, Trump asked White House counsel Don McGahn to issue a statement denying a story The Times published in January 2018. That story reported that McGahn told investigators Trump had ordered him to direct the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller. McGahn never issued the statement and reportedly told Trump that the president had, in fact, told him to have Mueller dismissed. The New York Times reported on August 18, 2018, that McGahn had been cooperating extensively with the Mueller investigation for several months and that he and his lawyer had become concerned that Trump \\"had decided to let Mr. McGahn take the fall for decisions that could be construed as obstruction of justice, like the Comey firing, by telling the special counsel that he was only following shoddy legal advice from Mr. McGahn\\". Trump also asked his former chief of staff Reince Priebus how his interview with investigators had gone and whether they were \\"nice\\". The Times reported that although \\"legal experts\\" thought the conversations probably did not constitute witness tampering, witnesses and attorneys who became aware of the conversations reported them to Mueller. The New York Times reported on March 15, 2018, that the Mueller investigation had subpoenaed documents from The Trump Organization, including all documents related to Russia. Although the full scope of the subpoena was not clear, it was the first known time investigators demanded documents from Trump's businesses. The Los Angeles Times reported the same day that the special counsel's office had also subpoenaed the Trump campaign for documents. The Daily Beast reported on March 22, 2018, that Mueller had taken over the probe into Guccifer 2.0 from the FBI. NBC News reported on March 30, 2018, that Ted Malloch, a London-based American professor and author who worked with the Trump campaign, had been detained and questioned by the FBI two days earlier as he arrived at Boston Logan Airport after a flight from London. He was served with a subpoena to appear for questioning by Mueller's investigators on April 13, and presented with a warrant to have his phone seized and searched. Malloch told NBC in an email that FBI agents asked him a variety of questions, including about Roger Stone, author Jerome Corsi, and WikiLeaks. CNN reported that Malloch has written a forthcoming book alleging a \\"deep state\\" within the United States government fabricated the Steele dossier to destroy Trump. Corsi was subpoenaed for questioning by Mueller's investigators in September 2018, and by November he was facing perjury charges. That month, a draft court filing showed Corsi and Stone had exchanged emails in summer 2016 indicating their knowledge of impending email \\"dumps\\" by Wikileaks. In one email, Stone directed Corsi to contact Assange, which Corsi told investigators he had ignored, although investigators found he had passed the directive to an associate in London, whom Corsi later identified as Malloch. Michael R. Caputo, a former communications adviser for the Trump campaign, was interviewed by Mueller's investigators on May 2, 2018. Caputo was recruited to the Trump campaign by Paul Manafort and had previously worked with Russian politicians. A long-time associate of Roger Stone, Caputo stated after his interview, \\"It's clear they are still really focused on Russia collusion. They know more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there.\\" CNN reported on May 5, 2018, that Mueller's investigators had interviewed Trump's close friend and inaugural committee chairman Tom Barrack in December 2017, asking him primarily about his relationship with Manafort and Gates, although The Associated Press reported the interview was broader and included campaign finance matters. On May 9, 2018, CNBC reported that Mueller's office had contacted telecommunications giant AT&T; regarding payments totalling at least $200,000, but possibly as high as $600,000, made to a company founded by Michael Cohen in order to gain \\"insights\\" into the incoming Trump administration. An AT&T; spokesperson said that they had provided all the information requested by the Special Counsel in November and December 2017. Glenn R. Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on August 22, 2017, that the FBI told Christopher Steele‚Äîand then Steele told Simpson‚Äîthat the FBI had \\"a human source from inside the Trump organization\\" (and, more specifically, \\"an internal Trump campaign source\\"). Simpson did not indicate when Steele received this information or when he conveyed it to Simpson. The Washington Post reported on May 8, 2018, that a longtime FBI and CIA informant had provided information about connections between Russia and the Trump campaign to FBI investigators early in their investigation. This sparked speculation that the FBI had planted a \\"mole\\" inside the Trump campaign, although it was not clear that the individual Simpson described was the same individual described by The Post. The Washington Post reported on May 9, 2018, that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes subpoenaed the Justice Department to provide him with all documents regarding the longtime informant; The Post quoted the subpoena as demanding \\"all documents referring or related to the individual referenced in Chairman Nunes' April 24, 2018, classified letter to Attorney General Sessions\\", although Nunes denied he had referred to any specific individual. The Justice Department resisted on the grounds that revealing the information could endanger the life of a longtime top-secret informant for the FBI and CIA, and the Trump White House‚Äîwith the president's agreement‚Äîsided with the Justice Department. The New York Times reported on May 16, 2018, that at least one government informant had met several times with Trump campaign aides Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. The Washington Post noted on January 9, 2018, that the source Simpson had referred to may not necessarily have been an informant willingly or directly, or during the campaign, but rather may have become an informant as a result of later becoming implicated in wrongdoing. Natasha Bertrand, then with Business Insider, reported on January 3, 2018, that a source told her Simpson had been referring to George Papadopoulos, who had first been interviewed by the FBI seven days after Trump's inauguration and whose cooperation with the FBI‚Äîto \\"provide information regarding any and all matters as to which the Government deems relevant\\"‚Äîbegan with his arrest on July 27, 2017, and was not publicly known until his indictment in October 2017. The New York Times reported on May 18, 2018, that the FBI sent an informant to meet with George Papadopoulos in late-summer 2016, and to meet repeatedly with Carter Page over ensuing months, after the FBI had acquired evidence that the two men had suspicious contacts with Russians. The Washington Post reported the same day that the informant first approached Page at a symposium in Britain in July 2016, and in September 2016 invited Papadopoulos to London to work on a research paper. Late that summer, the informant also met with Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis in Northern Virginia. The informant was identified as an American academic who teaches in Britain, but both The Times and The Post declined to publish his name. NBC News identified him as Stefan Halper. The Washington Post reported on June 28, 2018, that the Mueller investigation, as well as British investigators, were examining relationships between the Brexit movement, Russia and the Trump campaign. The Post reported that Mueller's investigators had specifically asked two individuals, including former Trump communications official Michael Caputo, about relationships between Trump associates and Brexit leader Nigel Farage. Ted Malloch, who had worked with the Trump campaign and was later questioned by Mueller investigators, was reportedly close to Farage. ABC News reported on September 20, 2018, that Michael Cohen had been interviewed by Mueller's investigators multiple times since he pleaded guilty to charges a month earlier. The interviews covered a broad range of topics, including Trump's business dealings with Russians, alleged collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign and whether Trump or his associates had discussed a pardon of Cohen with him. In August 2018, a sealed court case was brought before Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the DC District Court, who oversees grand jury proceedings. The case bounced back and forth between Howell and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals over several weeks, as press speculation grew that the secret case was related to a witness challenging a Mueller subpoena. CNN reporters observed Mueller attorneys entering Howell's courtroom in September. CNN later confirmed that the case did involve a Mueller subpoena that was being challenged. The case was heard by a three-judge panel of the Circuit court on December 14, amid such secrecy that the entire fifth floor of the court building was cleared so reporters could not observe the proceedings or participants. Four days later, the judges ruled that the plaintiff, an unnamed foreign company, must comply with the subpoena. The company appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court on December 22, although the Court is not known to hear cases that are completely sealed. The Court denied the appeal on January 8, 2019.  Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal  The Wall Street Journal reported on December 15, 2017, that Mueller's office had requested and received employee emails from Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked for the Trump campaign, earlier that year. The Washington Post reported on March 20, 2018, that Christopher Wylie, an employee of Cambridge Analytica until late 2014, said that former Trump campaign CEO and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon oversaw a 2014 effort at the company (which he co- founded) to gather Facebook data on millions of Americans and test the effectiveness of anti-establishment messages such as \\"drain the swamp\\" and \\"deep state\\", which became major Trump themes after Bannon joined the campaign in August 2016. Views of Russian President Vladimir Putin were also tested. The Associated Press reported on March 22, 2018, that the special counsel is examining the connections between the company, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, particularly how voter data may have been used in battleground states. Several news agencies reported on April 4, 2018, that the security of 87 million Facebook users' private data had been shared, without their consent, via Cambridge Analytica, influencing voters and helping Trump win the 2016 election. The New York Times reported on May 15, 2018, that the Justice Department and FBI were investigating Cambridge Analytica, although it was unclear if Mueller's office was involved in the investigation. == Cost == By December 2018, the investigation had cost approximately $25 million but gained approximately $48 million. More than half of the cost of the investigation was for personnel compensation and benefits. The gains were accrued primarily by uncovering unpaid taxes by targets in the investigation, seizing assets, and collecting fines. == Criminal charges == The Special Counsel indicted 34 people‚Äîseven U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch national‚Äîand three Russian organizations. Two additional individuals were charged as a result of referrals to other FBI offices. Manafort speaking to media at the 2016 Republican National Convention Charges were filed against Trump campaign members George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen. Charges were also filed against bank account seller Richard Pinedo, and lawyer Alex van der Zwaan as well as Paul Manafort associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Also indicted were Russia-based Internet Research Agency and related organizations and individuals directed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, and a group of Russian hackers referred to as Viktor Netyksho, et al. On March 16, 2020, the US government dropped the charges against Prigozhin-owned companies Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering.\\"\\" Following the guilty plea of Michael Cohen for lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee, ranking member Mark Warner stated the Committee had made multiple criminal referrals of individuals to Mueller and continues to examine witness testimonies for other false statements. The Democrat- controlled House Intelligence Committee voted in February 2019 to refer dozens of witness testimony transcripts and thousands of other documents to Mueller's office. Committee Republicans had blocked Democrat efforts to release the documents to Mueller's office when Republicans controlled the Committee in 2018. On January 25, 2019, Roger Stone, a long time advisor to Donald Trump, was arrested by the FBI at a pre-dawn raid in Florida. The indictment filed by the Office of the Special Counsel contained 7 charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering, and lying to congress in regard to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and his involvement with WikiLeaks. In the charging document, prosecutors alleged that, after the first Wikileaks release of hacked DNC emails in July 2016, \\"a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [WikiLeaks].\\" The indictment also alleged that Stone had discussed Wikileaks releases with multiple senior Trump campaign officials. By the time of those contacts, it had been publicly reported that the DNC emails had been hacked by Russians and provided to Wikileaks. Stone was convicted of all charges in November 2019, after the conclusion of the investigation and his sentence was commuted by Trump.  Indictments  A total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates and campaign officials. None of those five convictions \\"involved a conspiracy between the campaign and Russians\\" and \\"Mueller did not charge or suggest charges for [...] whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russians to influence the election\\". The investigation was, however, more complex. On May 29, 2019, In a press conference, Mueller stated that \\"If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime... A president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view ‚Äì that too is prohibited.\\" Dozens of ongoing investigations originally handled by the Special Counsel's office were forwarded to district and state prosecutors, other Department of Justice (DoJ) branches, and other federal agencies. The following (in alphabetical order) were indicted during the Mueller investigation: * 13 Russians implicated in election interference: Mueller's team indicted thirteen Russian citizens and three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency (IRA), for conducting social media campaigns about the U.S. elections, and twelve members of the Russian GRU cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, for hacking and leaking DNC emails in June 2018. The other Russian indicted who was not a direct employee of Fancy Bear was Russian business tycoon Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was alleged to have served as the financier for the organization. * Maria Butina, who had claimed to be a Russian gun activist, was investigated by the Special Counsel investigators and then prosecuted by the National Security Law Unit. She was imprisoned for espionage after entering a guilty plea. * Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, pled guilty to making hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in violation of campaign finance laws, and was convicted for several unrelated counts of bank and tax fraud. * Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who had been appointed as National Security Advisor by the incoming Trump administration, was dismissed from his position and later pled guilty to making false statements to FBI investigators about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. * Konstantin Kilimnik, Manafort's business partner in Ukraine, was indicted for witness tampering at the behest of Manafort; Kilimnik is suspected of working for Russian intelligence. * Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman was found guilty on eight felony counts of tax evasion and bank fraud, pursuant to his earlier lobbying activities for the Party of Regions of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich. He later pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of justice; in total, he was sentenced to over seven years in jail in February 2018. * George Papadopoulos Trump campaign adviser was convicted for making false statements to the FBI. * Roger Stone, a longtime Trump advisor who had met with a Russian person offering to sell derogatory financial information about Hillary Clinton, was indicted on seven charges of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He pled not guilty. The jury subsequently found him guilty on all seven counts.Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Rachel Weiner. Roger Stone guilty on all counts in federal trial of lying to Congress, witness tampering. Washington Post, November 15, 2019. == Conclusions == Letter from Attorney General William Barr to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees notifying them about conclusion of the investigation  Report sent to Attorney General  On March 22, 2019, the special counsel's office concluded their investigation and sent a report to the Department of Justice where it was received by Attorney General William Barr. Barr, at Trump's nomination, had become Attorney General on February 14, 2019, gaining oversight of the investigation from Trump-appointed Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Whitaker had assumed oversight from Rosenstein on November 7, 2018, after the resignation of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation. Both Barr and Whitaker had been critical of the Mueller investigation before their appointments. Barr has faced bipartisan pressure to release the full report to the public, to the maximum extent permissible by law. On March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress regarding the special counsel's findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice. Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election, Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election, firstly disinformation and social media campaigns by the Internet Research Agency to cause social discord, and secondly computer hacking and strategic release of emails from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party organizations. However, Barr quoted the report as saying: \\"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\\" On the question of obstruction of justice, Barr said no conclusion was reached by the special counsel, noting that Mueller wrote \\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him\\". Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the evidence for obstruction of justice could not form the basis for a prosecution. On April 18, Barr and Rosenstein held a press conference ninety minutes before a redacted version of the report, titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. A less-redacted version is planned to be accessible to \\"a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees\\".  Follow-up to Attorney General's letter  The New York Times reported on April 3, that some members of the special counsel had told associates that they believe Barr's letter did not adequately portray their findings, which they considered to be more troubling for Trump than reported. The next day, The Washington Post reported that members of Mueller's team, who spoke anonymously, reported that the evidence gathered on obstruction of justice was \\"much more acute than Barr suggested.\\" These members of Mueller's team revealed that they believed that the evidence showed Trump obstructed justice, but that the entire team could not draw a conclusion because they were split over the evidence and law. The Washington Post report did not explain why they believed their findings to be more serious than Barr's conclusions and it is unknown how many members of the special counsel hold these opinions. Barr's letter quoted Mueller's report as stating, \\"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\\" leading Barr to write, \\"the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\\" and concluding, \\"while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction.\\" Some legal analysts challenged Barr's reasoning that Trump would not have intended to obstruct justice solely because he knew he had not committed a crime, noting that one can have intent to obstruct justice for other reasons, such as protecting associates from harm.  Congressional requests for full report  On April 3, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee, which did not receive the unredacted report by its April 2 deadline, voted 24-17 along party lines to approve a resolution which authorizes subpoenas of the full report. The resolution also authorized subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, chief of staff Reince Priebus, former-White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Annie Donaldson. The Justice Department discussed the report with White House attorneys, and Barr discussed it in a April 18, 2019, press conference, a few hours before its release to Congress and the public later that day. On April 19, 2019, Nadler issued a subpoena for the release of the full unredacted report. On May 3, 2019, Nadler informed Barr that a subpoena had been issued giving him until May 6 to release the full unredacted Mueller Report to the House Judiciary Committee. On May 6, after Barr failed to meet the committee's deadline to release the full report, the committee agreed to hold a vote to start Contempt of Congress proceedings against Barr on May 8. A law issued in 1857 gives Congress the power to issue criminal charges for this matter.Act of January 24, 1857, Ch. 19, sec. 1, 11 Stat. 155. Trump's announcement of executive privilege came just hours before the House Judiciary Committee planned to vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt. On May 8, 2019, after Trump invoked executive privilege, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to reject White House's assertion of executive privilege and approve a motion put forward by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl) which states that a vote to hold Barr in contempt would not \\"be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules.\\" In a 24-16 vote, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt.  Release of redacted report  On April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the Special Counsel's report titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. About one-eighth of the lines in the public version were redacted. The report was in two volumes, the first about Russian interference in the election and potential involvement of Trump associates, and the second on possible obstruction of justice by Trump.  Russian interference  The report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election did occur \\"in sweeping and systematic fashion\\" and \\"violated U.S. criminal law.\\" The first method detailed in the final report was the usage of the Internet Research Agency, waging \\"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\\". The Internet Research Agency also sought to \\"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\\". The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service, the GRU, hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \\"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's personas \\"DCLeaks\\" and \\"Guccifer 2.0.\\"Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \\"DCLeaks\\" and \\"Guccifer 2.0.\\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.  Conspiracy or coordination  To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \\"applied the framework of conspiracy law\\", and not the concept of \\"collusion\\", because collusion \\"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \\"collusion.\\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \\"collud[e]\\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \\"coordinated\\" with Russia, using the definition of \\"coordination\\" as having \\"an agreement ‚Äî tacit or express ‚Äî between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \\"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\\" was not enough to establish coordination.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \\"coordinat[ed]\\" ‚Äî a term that appears in the appointment order ‚Äî with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \\"coordination\\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement ‚Äî tacit or express ‚Äî between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The report writes that the investigation \\"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\\", found that Russia \\"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally\\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \\"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\\". The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony.Mueller Report, Vol. 1, p.10: The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual ¬ß¬ß 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \\"taint\\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States. Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated-including some associated with the Trump Campaign---deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.  Obstruction of justice  The second volume of the report investigated the topic of obstruction of justice, describing ten episodes where Trump may have obstructed justice as president and one episode before he was elected, and analyzing each in terms of the criteria needed to constitute criminal obstruction. The investigation found both public and private actions \\"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian- interference and obstruction investigations\\". However, Trump mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions. The Mueller team refrained from charging Trump with obstruction because investigators abided by a DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and they feared that charges would affect Trump's governing and possibly preempt a potential impeachment. In addition, investigators felt it would be unfair to accuse Trump of a crime without charges and without a trial in which he could clear his name. Since they had decided \\"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\\" on whether to \\"initiate or decline a prosecution,\\" the special counsel's office \\"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct.\\" The report \\"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\\", but specifically did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, because investigators were not confident that Trump was innocent after examining his intent and actions. The report concluded that Congress has the authority to take further action against Trump on the question of obstruction of justice, stating that no one is above the law. == End of investigation == On May 29, 2019, Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down, and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time. Saying \\"[t]he report is my testimony,\\" he indicated he would have nothing to say that wasn't already in the report. On the subject of obstruction of justice, he said he had been prohibited by Justice Department policy from charging the president with a crime and that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a \\"process other than the criminal justice system\\". This suggested that the investigation could now be picked up by Congress. He stressed that the central conclusion of his investigation was \\"that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.\\" He also stated: \\"If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime\\". The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees subpoenaed Mueller on June 25, 2019, with a letter saying that \\"the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions.\\" Mueller reluctantly agreed to testify publicly with a scheduled date of July 17. This date was later pushed back to July 24. During his testimony, Mueller answered Republican Representative Ken Buck that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office. == Reactions  Investigations into origins of probes == There have been numerous calls and requests to open a counter- investigation into the origins of the FBI's Operation Crossfire Hurricane probe, with attention on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) documents against Carter Page and the Steele dossier. On April 9, 2019, Attorney General William Barr testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee. Barr announced that the Department of Justice will be \\"reviewing the conduct\\" of the FBI's Russia probe. \\"I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,\\" Barr said. Barr also said that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz will be releasing a report on the FBI's use of the FISA process and related matters. The report is expected to be released in May‚ÄìJune 2019. When asked whether he was suggesting that spying occurred, Barr said, \\"I think that spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.\\"Video of April 10 hearing, by AP. During Attorney General Barr's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, Barr again said he was looking into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe. ‚ÄúMany people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant [referring to Stefan Halper] and a FISA warrant,\\" Barr stated. \\"I‚Äôd like to find out whether that is in fact true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop a threat as it's being represented.‚Äù When asked by Republican Representative John Cornyn \\"Can we state with confidence that the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign‚Äù Barr responded ‚ÄúNo. That is one of the areas that I am reviewing. I‚Äôm concerned about it. And I don‚Äôt think it's entirely speculative.‚Äù When asked about FISA abuses by the DOJ and FBI during his testimony, Barr responded \\"These are the things I need to look at, and I have to say as I said before, to the extent that there was any overreach, it was a few people in the upper echelons of the (FBI) and perhaps the department, but those people are no longer there\\", Barr said. Barr appointed a federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in the investigation. On October 24, 2019, news media reported that Durham had opened a criminal probe into the matter, giving him the power to empanel a grand jury and to compel testimony. On May 7, 2020, the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released dozens of transcripts from the Russia probe. Top officials from the Obama administration had testified that they had no empirical evidence of links between Trump associates and Russian officials. == See also == * Nobody Is Above the Law, a nationwide protest held on November 8, 2018 * Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, a proposed law that sought to protect the investigation * Russian espionage in the United States * Russia involvement in regime change * RT America, the American arm of the RT network * Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections == References  External links == * Full redacted report from the Special Counsel.

Members of del Mazo's family have collectively governed the State of Mexico for 23 years, starting with his grandfather Alfredo del Mazo V√©lez (1945-1951); then followed by his father Alfredo del Mazo Gonz√°lez (1981-1986) and his cousin Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (2005-2011); adding Arturo Montiel, Pe√±a Nieto's uncle, the del Mazo family's rule extends to 29 years. ==Early life== Del Mazo was born on 5 December 1975 to Alfredo del Mazo Gonz√°lez, governor of the State of Mexico between 1981 and 1986; his grandfather, Alfredo del Mazo V√©lez, was in turn governor between 1945 and 1951. He is also a cousin of former president and former governor Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. He attended the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico and graduated with a degree in business administration, then went on to graduate studies at Harvard University. In his early career, he held several public and private sector positions of a financial nature. He was a Developer of Financial Projects for Grupo Financiero Serf√≠n between 1996 and 1997 and Banco Azteca from 2003 to 2005. He also briefly worked at Pemex between 2000 and 2001. ==Political career== Del Mazo's first post in the State of Mexico government was as the director general of small business programs in the Secretariat of Economic Development, from 2005 to 2006; he left that post to serve as the director general of the State of Mexico Entrepreneurship Institute, where he remained for two years before being tapped to serve as the state secretary of tourism. He also became a national political councilor and member of the PRI's Permanent Political Commission. In 2009, del Mazo successfully ran for the municipal presidency of Huixquilucan and served a three-year term. When that term ended, newly installed President Pe√±a Nieto placed him in the position of director of Banobras, the National Bank of Public Works and Services. During most of this time, he also presided a committee heading outreach to Congress by the Mexican Federation of Municipalities. In 2015, voters in the 18th district of the State of Mexico, also including Huixquilucan, sent del Mazo to the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. He presided over two commissions but not at the same time, leaving the Infrastructure Commission in March 2016 to become the president of the Budget and Public Account Commission, a post he would hold until leaving the Chamber definitively on January 30, 2017, in order to pursue a candidacy for governor. He was replaced in San L√°zaro by Miguel √Ångel Ram√≠rez Ponce. 2017 gubernatorial campaign Six years after initially pursuing the PRI gubernatorial nomination secured by Eruviel √Åvila in 2011, del Mazo was tapped as the PRI's gubernatorial candidate in 2017, vying for an office the party had never lost. During the campaign, del Mazo was criticized for promoting himself using images from the Japanese animated film My Neighbor Totoro without permission. The election quickly turned into a two-horse race with del Mazo being challenged by Morena candidate Delfina G√≥mez √Ålvarez. On election day, the official count gave del Mazo the victory with 33.69 percent of the vote compared to 30.91 percent for G√≥mez √Ålvarez. Accusations of electoral fraud Despite the official vote results given by the National Electoral Institute, the election was marred by irregularities including reports of vote-buying, spending beyond legal campaign finance limits, and electoral counts that gave del Mazo extra votes that awarded the election to him. In November 2017, Proceso magazine published an article accusing the PRI of breaking at least 16 state laws during the elections, which were denounced 619 times. They said that all of them were broken in order to favor del Mazo during the election.http://www.proceso.com.mx/511392/ni-libre-ni-autentica-la-eleccion- en-edomex-ni-fraude Governor of the State of Mexico Alfredo del Mazo was sworn in as governor on September 15, 2017. One of his campaign promises was to decrease crime within his first 100 days as governor. However, the opposite happened instead: 28,508 violent crimes were reported within Alfredo del Mazo's first month as governor, the highest violent crime figure in the history of the State of Mexico.https://aristeguinoticias.com/2211/mexico/recrudecen-asaltos-con- violencia-en-edomex-video/https://aristeguinoticias.com/2111/mexico/gobierno- de-alfredo-del-mazo-inicio-con-record-de-delitos/ In September 2020, del Mazo proposed a major overhall of the state administration, creating a Department of Women and the fusion of other departments. Just a few days earlier, a group of feminists burned the offices of the Human Rights Commission (Codhem) in Ecatepec in protest against governmental innaction related to femicides, child molestation, and other concerns. ==Personal life== Del Mazo is married to Fernanda del Castillo; the couple have four children, including two from a previous relationship. On 30 March 2017, del Castillo gave birth to a child, Alfredo del Mazo IV. ==See also== *Atlacomulco Group ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Toluca Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:Politicians from the State of Mexico Category:Governors of the State of Mexico Category:21st-century Mexican politicians Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico alumni ","title":"Alfredo del Mazo Maza"},{"id":"54266390","text":"Alessio Geromoaddi (died 1611) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Isernia (1606‚Äì1611).
